      "text": "Yesterday was the 25th anniversary of the Agile Manifesto. The CEO of PMI posted a celebration on LinkedIn and announced a new product: the Manifesto for Enterprise Agility, launching March 3rd.\n\nIn his post, he shared a stat: 85% of executives say agility is critical, but only 32% are satisfied with implementation. A 53-point gap.\n\nI have a small page that critiques Agile frameworks. 5 followers. I left a comment asking a simple question: if the original manifesto couldn't close this gap in 25 years, what does a new one offer that the previous ones didn't?\n\nNo links, no pitch, no product, just a question using his own data.\n\nHis first response: \"I don't think you got the point. It's NOT about software development.\" Except his own post opens by celebrating the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and how it revolutionized software development, the software context was entirely his.\n\nI pointed this out politely and repeated the question.\n\nHis second response (edited before posting): \"You don't seem to understand, or you pretend not to understand. Please promote your services directly without using me or PMI.\"\n\nFive followers, zero links, zero services mentioned. Just one question about his own data. Then my comment pointing out the contradiction was removed.\n\nI have screenshots of the entire interaction, the post is public, everything is documented.\n\nNot sharing this to complain, sharing it because the response pattern is exactly what the Agile industrial complex does at every level: when you question the framework, you become the problem. The question never gets answered.\n\nStill waiting for someone to explain what manifesto number six offers that the first five didn't.\n\nAnyway, has anyone else had this experience questioning the Agile establishment publicly?",

          "text": "Oh I know the answer to this! The head of PMI knows nothing about any of this. This new manifesto was created by clever people - but not him. So he reacted from a place of (slight) arrogance and (lots of) fear. Uncertainty is scary after all. \n\nBTW The PMI are as agile (and indeed Agile) as the least agile thing you could imagine. A large concreted block of concrete, concreted into some more concrete.  \n\nThis new endeavour is an attempt to revitalise the PMI Agilealliance. The non-profit that was originally set up by many of the original manifesto authors to advocate for agile ideas, methods and principles. It funded itself via its large Agile conference Agile20XX which due to Covid, the changing world etc has now failed to generate any profit (indeed costing millions) and so the AA had to find a partner/owner to support them otherwise they would have perished. \n\nThey were effectively consumed by the PMI and the PMI are now working out what to do with this new potential product set. \n\nBTW It's worthwhile not treating the \"agile industrial complex\" (an utterly ridiculous phrase and idea) as one whole thing. It's a series of organisations with very different drivers, needs and wants. It's definitely worth your while understanding the difference and analysing it. It would help with any critique you would like to make. \n\nIn this case, you, a person with an obvious grudge to share but no followers or indeed weight, went after someone of huge \"heft\" but zero agile knowledge. Neither of you have come out looking very good. As someone who likes Agile but hates this direction - I think I'm left happy. 😃",

A nobody account asked a question using the man's own numbers and got accused of self-promotion and had their comment deleted. You literally just said he has \"huge heft but zero agile knowledge.\" That's... exactly what I said. We're arguing the same thing here.\n\nAnd look, call \"agile industrial complex\" ridiculous if you want but when the inventor of Scrum tells me 65% of teams fail and blames the users, somebody needs to name the elephant. Open to better names.\n\n\"Neither of us came out looking good\", fair. But only one of us deleted the other's comment.",

So many of these surveys treat the executives as a demigod who wants X, Y, and Z instead of the flawed human beings that they are who are ACTUALLY responsible for modeling and structuring the organization that they want. \n\nOr in other words, if execs area unhappy about agility, what the hell are they doing about it?

Government can do that. Old companies and monopolies can do that. Utilities can and should do that. When there isn't much pressure to change these things can all be acceptable.

No-one ran CI/CD pipelines from tape.    \n\nA good chunk of the problems people post here are from ignoring those basic values and principles, and wondering why things go wrong, which is a sign of how much the surface \"project management\" frameworks overtook the need for technical excellence.  \n\nEnterprises change direction fast.\n\nThey do this by acquisitions and divestments.   \n  \nWhich means they would rather lay-off 2000 people and by a new company, because it's lower cost and less risk than trying to pivot those 2000 people to a new business domain or market.\n\nWe are seeing this happen, in real time.",

It was an economic response to people becoming more expensive than machines. When your biggest cost was a room-sized computer, you measured twice and cut once. When your biggest cost became developers, you iterated. I've been writing about this for months and never framed it that cleanly. Might steal that if you don't mind.\n\nThe 43 manifestos point is perfect, at some point the format itself became the product. Write values, add principles, sell training. Rinse repeat.\n\nAnd the acquisition point is the real answer to \"enterprise agility.\" Companies don't pivot 2000 people. They fire 2000 people and buy a company that already has what they need. That's the actual enterprise agility. No manifesto required. Just a checkbook and a layoff plan.\n\nYou clearly think about this stuff deeper than most people posting in these threads.

I do think the original Agile Manifesto had a positive impact on software development and on software project management; I adopted Scrum in 2006 and haven't looked back. It certainly is a fantastic lightweight process framework for managing small projects with one or two teams, and Scrum can be extended to be a very powerful and adaptive framework for large projects and programs... I've done it. (I use my own scaling practices, not any of the well-known frameworks.)\n\n  \nI agree: most organizations that have tried Agile transformations have not seen the value. I spent 15 years helping companies... from Microsoft to startups... maximize the benefits of an Agile approach, and had considerable success. Most engagements started with an initial discussion of what the client was currently doing, followed by my simple question: \"Do you want to do Scrum?\" Yes was always the answer, so I'd ask again. \"Do you want to DO Scrum, and not some approximation of Scrum like what you're doing that isn't working?\" That question led to a pause, and then a deeper conversation.",

Because it proves the framework can work when someone with 15 years of experience is in the room asking the hard questions and holding the team accountable to actually doing it. The problem is the industry scaled the framework without scaling people like you, they sold the cert and skipped the \"deeper conversation\" part.\n\nAnyway I'm curious about your own scaling practices though.

You've just increased the noise.\n\nThe Scrum rituals feel like a stop sign because they were designed to ration a scarce resource (developer time).

Instead of \"build login feature\" they're focusing on \"improve user onboarding conversion by X%\" and letting the AI agents figure out the how.

Think less sprint planning, more frequent strategy check-ins.  \n  \nThe other pattern that's working is treating the AI output as prototypes rather than finished features. Even if something gets built and deployed quickly, teams are using retrospectives to evaluate whether it actually solved the user problem or if they need to iterate.

What actually works:\n\nContinuous flow with a review gate. No sprints, no planning ceremonies. Work moves through a simple pipeline: define → build → review → ship. The human bottleneck isn't building anymore. It's reviewing. So the process should optimize for review quality, not build velocity.\n\nKill the backlog, keep a priority list. 5-10 items max, ordered by business value. No grooming sessions, no estimation. If something is worth doing, it goes on the list. If it's not top 5, it doesn't exist yet.\n\nDaily async check-ins instead of standups.

I \"grew up\" as a software developer during the same times as the people who wrote it, and experienced the same issues with the massive processes of the 1980s and 1990s. The \"funny\" part is that the complaints I hear today about Scrum and SAFe and other 🐂💩 approaches are the same ones we were making and the same ones that led to the Agile Manifesto being written in the first place!\n\nI'm lucky enough to know several of the authors of the manifesto, count some as friends and to even have worked with some of them. From all that, I know what they were trying to achieve, and for a while in the early 2000s they (we!) did! Things started to go south when the Certified Scrum Master program became popular and you could be \"certified\" after parking your arse in a chair for two days. Scrum also appealed to the project management community because it focused on just that - project management practices - where XP extended those with the technical practices as well.\n\nAnd here we are today, 25 years later, with islands of \"good\" in a vast sea of mediocrity and outright crap. I'm still building software, both hand-writing it and using LLMs, and helping individual teams as I go.\n\nOh, as for no estimates, I haven't estimated a story in years. I have, however, provided forecasts for releases constantly based on progress using story \\*counts\\* (Monte Carlo simulations are fantastic for this). I just break the required work down into the smallest reasonable stories and give a forecast (OK, estimate) based on the delivery rate of prior work. This has worked really well, though I'm sure everyone's mileage will vary. 🤷‍♂️",

And yet, nothing really moved faster. A few weeks later, the sprint was “busy” but progress felt thin. Not because the team wasn’t capable or committed, but because focus was split across too many “important” items. Over time, a pattern became obvious: When everything is P1, real priority disappears. Teams don’t avoid prioritization because they don’t understand Agile. They avoid it because prioritization forces trade offs and trade offs are uncomfortable, especially when multiple stakeholders are involved. Every story has value. Every request feels urgent. Every delay feels risky. So instead of choosing, we keep adding. What finally changed things wasn’t another estimation technique or a better backlog tool. It was forcing one constraint into the conversation: If only one thing can come first, what actually comes first? That single question shifted the discussion: hidden disagreements surfaced early, scope conversations became clearer, commitment improved because the team knew what truly mattered. Until one thing is clearly ahead of everything else, agility doesn’t increase, execution just becomes fragmented.   \nCurious how other Agile practitioners here handle prioritization when everything arrives labeled “urgent,” especially during sprint planning and backlog refinement.",

Another team had gone so far as to introduce level P0, which moas items then became!\n\nThe solution is at its core - good management.  Organizational skills and process knowledge are good too.   But everyone understands that everything cannot be done all at once, everyone understands team capacity limits, everyone understands the concepts of prioritization and scheduling.   Yet, they find themselves in this situation.   Good management adds “enforcement” of these concepts and, crucially, through persuasion in addition to the logic, gets everyone on board with them.  Not just on board, but on a foundation of understanding such that everyone is happy - happy with how things are going.  That is hard.  Hard, hard, hard.  But good managers do it.\n\nTools that I’ve used:\n\n- like the question you pose - pick one thing - are excellent.   I have had stakeholders bring their top 5, then we hash it out together\n- get ALL stakeholders involved in planning, period.   Do t do it unless all are present.  This prevents the busy C-suite guy from blowing it all up later because he “wasn’t there during planning”\n- Kanban - use the limits in Jira to illustrate, not enforce, how the load is spread and when capacity is reached.  Non-techies will understand this\n- identity “bubbling under” items in the backlog.  These are the ones that come up time and again for inclusion, but never quite make it.  So while everyone agrees that it is clearly a good and important idea, after many cycles, it’s clear that it is in reality not a priority.  After a year or two, it is clear that it is not even needed, since obviously the product is doing fine without it.  The point is - it’s nearly impossible to cull the backlog because yes, all of those are, truly, “good ideas”.  But reality like this illustrates to everyone that much of the backlog is truly NOT top priority, which helps people focus\n- in every sprint and release, have must-have and nice-to-have items.  The latter is a crucial pressure-release buffer.  Stakeholders can get items “in”, but without full expectation.  The dev team gets a win by getting to those items if they can.  Win-win.  Also, as dev manager, I have quietly moved items from must to nice and subtly changed my terminology when discussing it, and no one noticed.  I was able to avoid a couple of real crunches that way, though it is underhanded.",

But in practice the PO doesn't have authority to tell a VP that their feature isn't priority. So everything stays P1 because saying no is a career risk. The framework assumes a power dynamic that doesn't exist in most organizations.\n\nYour constraint question is the right one. \"If only one thing can come first, what actually comes first?\" But notice what happened, the thing that fixed it wasn't a ceremony or a framework. It was a single honest question that forced people to stop hiding behind process and make an actual decision.\n\nThat's the pattern I keep seeing.

But its only happened that it indeed was the most important project for the company. \n\n All other times, the disappointment would be palpable as I showed the company project prio list, and their were at position 20, and that it ment their request could be met but no earlier than in 36 months time. \"Unless you can get PMs and stakeholders X, Y and Z to deprioritize their projects A, B and C.\".",

Sometimes you need some little adjustments on the way, but the general acceptance and quality of agile processes was great. I took several mental notes experiencing all the different styles, collecting the \"good\" and avoiding the \"bad\"\n\nBut several years ago, one company failed so hard that it kept me scarred for life. And thats a good thing, because now I really know how bad it can get and what not to repeat.\n\nHere is a little list of traits for you. Be advidsed, this is a very anti-agility way of working:\n\n* No Scrum Master or PM. Sprint planning was a meeting were the principal dev assigned tickets.\n* No team effort to get something finished first. Everything had to be started at the same time.\n* Big tickets and big features. Your ticket -> Your responsibilty. Every Man for himself.\n* A supervising team in another timezone\n\nWhich of course lead to this behaviour:\n\n* You got 4-5 tickets assigned every sprint. If you're stuck, start the next ticket.\n* Stuck all the time, everything was in \"Doing\" because it looked good on reports for stakeholders (shit you not).\n* Dozens of context switches every day.\n* Barely got any help but also couldn't make any decisions on your own (because they later got rejected).\n* Developers should not merge code that wasn't executed (yet). The whole big feature (for all platforms) needed to be finished first.\n* Your code was reviewed by your local team. Then it was reviewed by a supervising team in another timezone, further delaying the merge.\n* Feature branches got stale and rotted 4-8 weeks (multiple sprints) before they got merged.\n\nIt failed so hard, that I already knew early on that this is fucked up beyond repair.\n\nAs a result, it never felt that we were a team or working on something together that makes actual sense. No documentation, no communication, no goals or understanding.\n\nI tried speaking up several times to make some small changes first (i.e. making tickets smaller, more refined and finish one ticket first before starting others) but was never heard. And as a developer who knows that this is not sustainable, it was the worst.\n\nBut yeah, I think some years later, experiencing hell first hand helped me appreciate every other team with a little structure, processes and dedicated roles.

And you're completely correct about how ineffective and inefficient it is. Some people and organizations are so used to it that they aren't interested in changing to something different. 🤷‍♂️  \n  \nSomething I *will* say, is that I'm OK with feature branches as long as they only live for minutes to hours rather than days. Because I've worked in so many domains over my career, I totally get that not all teams can use a continuous delivery model.\n\nWith respect to reviews, though, mob programming is by far the most effective way to handle them (because they happen in real time) than any other approach I've seen. The issue there is cultural - is a group willing to try it, and I don't just mean the programmers. To be effective, mobbing needs everyone (every role) that's required to get a piece of work from start to finish. But, if you're saddled with incompatible timezones, then you pretty much have to live with git or Github flow.\n\nI've been lucky, though, to work in a few places that truly \"got it\". The first was back in 1992, long before anything resembling agile methods existed! I was part of a team of 15-20 people and we got shit done. Our management was rather visionary for the time, insisting that the team be co-located with the people who would be consuming our work. We were trusted to do the work and not pestered for updates or ongoing estimates as long as there was tangible progress. When I learned about Extreme Programming in 2000, it resonated with a lot of what we did in that team 8 years earlier.\n\nSince then I've been able to recreate some of that magic. Boiling it all down, those successes came from close collaboration, limiting WIP, insisting on high quality and reflecting deeply and honestly on how we worked.",

A good example of manipulating definitions of \"done\" and \"releasable\" that I mention in my comment. \n\nIf it is a *true Agile*, there is no such thing as high or low quality. It is either *done* or *not done*. Agile has never called for abstract high quality. It should have *just enough* quality to *be releasable*. There is no high and low. It is a yes/no question, plain and simple. Either it is done (100%) or not (0%); no other options. This is actually the key element that creates the ground for inspection, enables feedback loops, and creates enough pressure to keep work limited and completed inside the sprint. If you don't have it *done*, the whole empirical loop falls apart, and you don't have any Agile anymore, no matter how many rituals are played.   \n  \nIf we have to call for an *abstract* quality, it typically means that what we produce is not a *releasable increment*. \n\nThat's an example of *deep* and *honest* reflection regarding quality in Agile. If the team isn't ready to reflect this way, then it fails to demonstrate one of the five values, probably the critical one when it comes to improving: *courage*. \n\nIt may sound not as *comforting* as many Agile teams are used to having this conversation, and if it causes discomfort, it could be a way better signal to run a meaningful retrospective than anything else. \n\np.s.

The project was in constant integration struggles, as teams were expanding their own scope while waiting for other teams for integration, and by the time the other teams were ready, the expanded scope meant that now the other team has to wait.\n\nFrom the inside it didn't look so bad since we reported to the proxy stakeholders faithfully and transparently and we never got back a signal that something's wrong.\n\nA few days before almost everyone got fired from the project, we were sitting with one of the most senior proxy stakeholders who talked our head off for an hour about how we won't release anything without making proper compherensive printed manuals.

How do 4-8 weeks of rotting branches and waiting for other devs fit into \"respond to change\"? How do you justify starting every ticket simultaneously but after 2 weeks you have nothing done? How do people matter over the process if they get ignored when they object and say \"How about we finish smth first\"? \n\nExactly. ",

A Scrum Master doesn't fix a supervising team in another timezone that rejects your decisions. A standup doesn't fix \"every man for himself\" when the incentives reward individual ticket assignment over collaboration.\n\nThe principal dev assigning tickets in sprint planning is command and control. But I've seen plenty of teams with a certified Scrum Master where the same dynamic plays out with different vocabulary. The PO \"prioritizes\" instead of \"assigns.\" The sprint goal is technically collaborative but everyone knows what they're working on before the meeting starts. The structure changes. The power dynamic doesn't.\n\nWhat you're describing is something I've been writing about called Risk Management Theater. Processes that perform control instead of practicing it. Everything in \"Doing\" because it looked good on reports. Code review by a supervising team in another timezone that existed to gatekeep, not collaborate. Feature branches rotting for weeks because the ceremony of approval mattered more than actually shipping.\n\nThe process wasn't failing. It was working exactly as designed. To create the appearance of oversight for stakeholders. Not to ship software.\n\nThe teams you worked on later that felt better probably weren't better because they had \"more Agile.\" They were better because someone with authority actually let the team make decisions. That's not a process improvement. That's a power structure change, no certification covers that.",

Typically unpleasant or hard things such as risk management or expectation management are the first victims of this attitude.\n\nActually, these two are anti-Agile behaviors if you consider Agile-by-design, but are good examples of Agile-as-it-is-practiced-by-majority.\n\nIf we speak of Agile-by-design, then the weakest point is the declaration of empiricism, which may be (and by many, including some Agile influencers, is) considered that \"only practical experience matters, and we work with any problem domain as if it were an ideal blackbox\". In fact, the efficient way to experiment is the scientific method, where you have a good, well-grounded theory or at least a model that you prove or disprove by a well-designed experiment.

We also implemented Agile about 4 months ago, so everyone is still getting the hang off how to point out stories, and breaking stories into appropriate sizes. \n\nI asked them what they hope to achieve with these metrics, and they said that they wanted to demonstrate that \"we're doing agile and getting stuff done.\" Basically they want to justify our existence and try to insulate us from cuts. \n\nSIGH, does anyone have thoughts on better metrics? \n\nFor additional context, this is an infrastructure department that largely does O&M, and has occasional upgrades. There's a lot of help desk type work from customers dealing with issues. A lot of their tasks are upgrading the existing systems to meet compliance and security guidance that's coming from other departments/government.

Or second-level metrics around the speed/lag/delay caused to others? And asynchronous/disconnected benefits or costs (think quality, stability and reliability and associated risks)\n\nUp to this point, you’ll have external metrics that are defined/measured outside the team. A next level might be to derive metrics around the behaviour internal to the team for the teams own use (velocity is one of these, possibly) but from an org/exec level, they should be interesting but useless - outside the team the only thing that matters is impact on the wider organisation. \n\nSuggest reading The Goal, It’s Not Luck and The Phoenix Project.",

Units of work are independent of the people/team doing the work, just as a mile is a mile regardless of who's running it. \n\nIn your world, it might be better just to calculate an 'issue velocity,' i.e., how many tickets your team (not individuals) can process to completion per unit of time (weekly or bi-weekly, whichever makes sense). What makes this useful for your team is that it gives you something concrete to use to assess process changes; if you come with idea to improve the way your team works and implement it, then issue velocity should increase. \n\nLean teams use throughput (the same thing as issue velocity), cycle time (the time it takes for an issue/work item to go through the entire workflow from when work actually starts on it until it's complete), and lead time (cycle time plus the time the issue waits from when it's created until work actually starts). These are three good metrics that can tell you how well you're doing, whether process changes increase efficiency or decrease it, and give you an idea of how long customers have to wait to get issues resolved. They are basic for process improvement, too.\n\nYour team should focus on the Lean metrics, measure them for a few weeks to get a baseline (a statistic of 1 is useless), and then try a process improvement change to see what impact it has on the metrics.\n\nI will tell you that I've worked with many teams (in the hundreds) and used these simple metrics plus techniques from Theory of Constraints and the Kanban Method to double, triple, even quadruple throughput in 90 days.",

We see teams have better conversations when they focus on lead time (how long from idea to customer), throughput (how many items delivered per sprint), and cycle time (active work time). These translate better to business outcomes than abstract story points.  \n  \nFor newer agile teams, I'd also suggest tracking things like how often scope changes mid-sprint, retrospective action completion rates, and maybe simple health metrics like team confidence in their sprint goals.

You need data from before agile to reference value achieved post implementation.\n\nAs for velocity, of course every team has a different velocity, that is a given. But velocity is a critical metric of teams running sprints. In fact if you are not tracking velocity, then why bother with sprints at all? I take it a step further and teams running sprints should track for a velocity variance of +/-10%. Because if you have a team that has a velocity of 44, but looking at the last 5 sprints if they have sprints of 48, 63, 29, 47, 32, those are wildly different outcomes painting a picture of instability, which would then spring the question, why? was it due to holidays, PTO, or did work get stuck then get flooded, low backlog health. Velocity for sprint teams is absolutely crucial for many more reasons as well.\n\n",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** Story mapping is a brilliant concept but doesn't scale to large, multi-team programs. I spent several years evolving story mapping into strata mapping, turning it from facilitation art into algorithmic process so I could use maps for both simple, single-team projects and  large, multi-team complex projects with regulatory constraints. Here's why that matters.\n\n# Why I Needed Something Different\n\nIn 2009, I had recently left a role as Group Program Manager running a 100-person product team working on mobile device platform and application software. I'd moved into consulting, helping large companies re-plan and rescue failing projects.\n\nThese weren't small team efforts. These were complex, multi-team programs with distributed workforces, regulatory constraints, and millions of dollars at stake in domains like aerospace, medical devices, financial applications, even silicon chip design. These product domains aren't suitable for continuous releases to customers without extensive testing, because the cost of releasing is very high due to regulatory requirements. If you get a feature wrong, the regulatory requirements alone might take a year to satisfy before the next release. Dumping feature or functional experiments on end users in these environments is bad for business.\n\nThat's when I encountered Jeff Patton at Agile 2009 in Chicago, explaining story mapping on a hallway wall. His approach interested me immediately. I could see the potential. Organizing work around user activities and workflows made intuitive sense. It was far better than the flat, prioritized backlogs most teams were struggling with.\n\nBut I also saw the constraints that would render it ineffective for my needs. It was too team-focused for large, multi-team programs and heavily dependent on skilled facilitation. It wasn't easy to replicate across projects or teams. It was an art, not a process I could teach and then hand to a project team and say \"use this.\"\n\n# The Problem with \"Art\" at Scale\n\nWhen you're rescuing a $50M failing program with thousands of backlog items, hundreds of people across multiple teams, distributed locations, regulatory constraints and hard deadlines, facilitation art hits limits. Three specific problems emerged: skilled facilitators don't scale (I couldn't be in every planning session), maps became \"one and done\" artifacts that gathered dust during execution, and inconsistent approaches across teams made integration nearly impossible.\n\nYet we still needed Agile benefits because large projects invariably have large uncertainty and risk. The answer: approach planning in a truly agile manner that embraces uncertainty and responds effectively to change. That required process, not craft.\n\n# Four Years of Evolution\n\nFrom 2009-2013, I identified and resolved issues as I used variations on story mapping for large projects.\n\nI found that starting with users and benefits (rather than activities) made everything clearer. Stories flowed naturally from understanding user needs. This became the anchor for consistent results across teams. Better yet, Users and Features became natural units for higher-level planning, supporting product roadmaps organized by User and Feature, portfolio planning across products, executive visibility into the forest instead of just trees.\n\nI needed Feature-level boundaries teams could own end-to-end for parallel work. I needed maps that stayed relevant during execution, not just planning. And I needed systematic validation that caught cross-workflow dependencies before development, not during.\n\nBy 2013, this had solidified into strata mapping.\n\n# Returning the Gift\n\nAt the Lean Kanban North America conference in 2013, I again ran into Jeff Patton and sat down for lunch with him.\n\n\"Jeff, why haven't you written a book about story mapping?\" I asked.\n\nHe said, \"Because it's an art, not a process.\"\n\n\"Let me show you my approach to story mapping... how I turned it into a process,\" I replied. I grabbed a napkin and showed him what I'd been developing: an algorithmic approach that made story mapping systematic and repeatable, not dependent on facilitation artistry. A way to turn the insights from his technique into a process that anyone could follow, especially for large, complex projects where you can't rely on a skilled facilitator being in every room.\n\n\"Wow,\" he said.\n\nHe wrote his book the next year.\n\n# Why Process Matters (And It's Not What You Think)\n\nThere's sometimes resistance in agile circles to \"process.\" But process is a tried and true engineering approach for consistency, repeatability, and predictability. This isn't against Agile tenets - it's recognizing that while requirements may be uncertain, consistent elaboration and decomposition approaches reduce ambiguity.\n\nWhen you write code, you follow patterns. You don't reinvent how to structure a class every time. Those patterns are process. They free your mind to focus on the unique problem, not basic mechanics.\n\nStrata mapping provides that same engineering discipline for planning. The process reduces cognitive load by handling the \"how,\" freeing teams to focus on \"what\" and \"why.\" It enables learning because consistent structure makes it easier to spot what's different between projects. It supports collaboration through shared language. And it builds institutional knowledge - new team members learn once, apply everywhere.\n\nThe irony: disciplined process enables more agility, not less. When mechanics are automatic, you respond to change faster.\n\n# Core Philosophy: Understanding Over Plans\n\nScope never changes. Understanding does.\n\nThe scope is \"allow users to log in.\" That never changes. What changes is our understanding that login might mean OAuth, 2FA, SSO, magic links, biometric authentication, or passwordless options.\n\nThis is why planning is more important than plans. We create maps to develop shared understanding. As we learn, we revise our maps continuously. They're living documents, not static blueprints.\n\nTeams I rescued had failed not because scope changed, but because they hadn't created an effective plan that could evolve as knowledge increased. They treated planning as a one-time activity. Plans became increasingly irrelevant while teams devolved into heroics trying to control chaos.\n\nStrata mapping makes planning continuous. The same algorithmic process that creates the map keeps it current during execution.\n\n# The War Room: Making Progress Visible\n\nI spent more than a decade working with product teams to physically create strata maps with sticky notes on big sticky pages during workshops, then moving them to walls reflecting current plans and backlogs. We \"flowed\" Stories and Features across kanban boards, modeling the incrementally emerging product.\n\nAny stakeholder could walk into our war room and see actual progress and implemented functionality. Not a three-month-old plan. The actual current state.\n\nThe power: anything on the \"completed\" side could be demonstrated in the actual product. The map wasn't aspirational. It was operational. It guided teams to successful delivery, gave stakeholders visibility into progress, and established project leadership credibility with executives.\n\nThis taught me something crucial: the map must reflect reality, not wishful thinking. If a Story showed \"done\" but the Feature wasn't demonstrable, something was wrong. The map forced honesty about actual progress.\n\nI'm releasing StrataTree, a SaaS product that virtualizes and digitizes this approach. Tomorrow, it'll include refinement, estimation, management, and forecasting capabilities that make it a virtual War Room, bringing visceral progress visibility to distributed teams anywhere.\n\n# User-First, Not Activity-First\n\nHere's where strata mapping diverges structurally from Patton's approach:\n\n**Patton starts with business activities:** What activities do users perform? What tasks make up those activities? What stories implement those tasks?\n\n**Strata mapping starts with users and benefits:** WHO are we solving for? WHAT benefit do they need? HOW do they get that benefit? (the workflow emerges from this)\n\nWhy does this matter? If you start with activities, you're assuming you know the workflow before you understand the benefit. When rescuing projects, I often found teams had mapped activities, but mapped the WRONG activities because they hadn't started with actual user needs.\n\n# The Fourth Level: Users at the Top\n\nThis leads to the structural difference:\n\n    Patton Story Mapping: Activities → Tasks → Stories (2-3 levels)\n    Strata Mapping: User → Feature → Step → Story (4 levels)\n\nThat User level at the top isn't just organizational. It's what makes everything work:\n\n**Forces focus on WHO:** Every Feature serves a specific User. Every Story traces to a User's need. Prevents solution-first thinking. Enables validation: \"Does this help this User?\"\n\n**Creates boundaries for parallel work:** Team A owns Features for User 1, Team B owns Features for User 2. Clear swim lanes, minimal coordination overhead. Essential for coordinating 5-10 teams on large programs.\n\n**Provides stability as understanding evolves:** Users don't change. Features might split or merge as you learn, but the User anchor prevents scope creep disguised as \"new requirements.\"\n\n    [User 1: Product Manager]    [User 2: Developer]\n              |                             |\n    [Feature A: Manage Backlog]   [Feature B: Track Work]\n              |                             |\n    [Step 1][Step 2][Step 3]      [Step 1][Step 2]\n      |       |       |             |       |\n    Story   Story   Story          Story   Story\n\nThis hierarchy makes the process algorithmic and replicable across teams.\n\n# What's Coming Next\n\nIn a future second post, I'll walk through the six-step algorithm:\n\n1. Identifying Users (algorithmic prioritization)\n2. Identifying Features (benefit-driven)\n3. Designing Workflow with Steps (with \"square map\" validation)\n4. Breaking Down into Stories (context-driven)\n5. Prioritizing and Drawing MMF Lines (the key differentiator)\n6. Cross-Step Dependency Validation (the genius part)\n\nEach step has clear questions, outputs, and validation checks. No facilitation required.\n\nThen in the third post: the two slicing patterns, delivery vs deployment vs release, scaling to large projects, and keeping maps alive during execution.\n\n**This is story mapping evolved for the complexity of modern product development.**\n\n**What's been your experience with story mapping? Does it stay relevant during execution for your teams, or does it become a \"planning artifact\" that gets forgotten? Have you tried to scale it beyond single teams? Please share your experiences.**",

For instance, we may have a Product Owner who has the need to manage a backlog, and an Engineering Manager, who might want to assess throughput across her teams (these are just example users/scenarios). The Engineering Manager might also want to be able to view backlogs from ADO/Jira as maps, so they'd use the same functionality as the Product Owner to do so. In this case the Engineering Manager is proxying the Product Owner for purposes of functionality. Similarly we may have an uber-Product Owner (I call this role the Chief Product Owner) for a large project with many teams, with each team having a team-level PO (I call this role the Product Owner delegate), but they'd use the same functionality in a similar manner.\n\nPart of the process of identifying users is to brainstorm all possible users, then group them in clusters based on similar use of the product before distilling the group down to a single user role (User).",

Everyone agrees it's priority. I go create Jira ticket, trying to capture all the Slack context in the description. Engineer picks up ticket, has questions, asks in Jira comments. I go back to Slack to clarify with stakeholders. Back to Jira with answer. Ticket gets implemented but slightly off because some nuance from Slack discussion didn't make it to Jira.\n\nThe context loss is real. Jira ticket says \"improve dashboard performance\" but the Slack thread has the actual customer pain story that makes it clear which performance issue matters. Engineer optimizes the wrong thing because they're working from the Jira description not the full context.\n\nTried linking Slack threads in Jira but nobody clicks links.

Leave the conversations where they naturally are - non-tech in Slack (they won’t likely use Jira comments, or use them well they’ll just add confusion - the non-tech discussion usually includes much scope creep, other possibilities, totally extraneous comments, and is distracting to the engineer).  Link to the Slack conversation, but don’t RELY on that link.  The ticket itself should be self-contained with all of the agreed-upon-by-the-stakeholder goals, a proper Definition of Done.  Concise, clear, and a good target for the engineer.  \n\nWhat’s needed is some official direction IN THE TICKET to review the Slack conversation at the start of work.  This will give the engineer that context, and work out what’s distracting and what’s useful.  It also captures any truly IMPORTANT nuances on the conversation that may affect the definition of done, or the estimate, or the scope.   That conversation, though distracting, is often important this way.  Beyond this, the engineer is to follow what the ticket says.  The Slack convo is just a resource feeding that, it itself is not authoritative.  Be sure everyone understands this - if it’s not in DoD it’s not enough that it’s in the convo.  And, give them pathways to get it into the DoD. Also - the Slack convo is often very good for designing the QA tests, but again - it is not the system of record for those tests. \n\nWith the stakeholders, be clear about this.  They need to agree the Definition of Done, and agree that the slack is not authoritative, especially after work starts.  Should something vital come up, they need to sound a bigger alarm and not just add to the convo.  Standups, sprint planing meetings, etc. - these are the times to nail down the DoD. \n\nFinally, YOU need to keep up on the conversations and make sure all of this is being followed, that the information is flowing where it needs to go.  Ultimately good habits will be built, and there will be clarity all round.   Bells will sound, angels will sing, the sun will shine brightly…\n\nTLDR - organize your process around the ticket being the ironclad authoritative system of record, and get everyone focused and clear on that.",

The events are actually what become the user stories in jira, not the use case. Your end to end testing is just applying the use case to your string of user stories to make sure you get the result expected. \n\nYou said you just take the requirement from slack and put it in one user story? No wonder there are gaps. Why just one story, when a request may have several parts? You may need a DevOps story to create a table, and a backend story to develop an API for it.

We used a lite kanban with just enough scrum to keep leadership off our backs, every story was a zero or a one story points to simplify planning, there was no team lead or authoritarian style power structure on the team every decision was a discussion, consensus, and even if the team went a way I didn’t like I could trust my coworkers’s competence was high and intentions were good.\n\nProcess and metrics have cost.

          "text": "A few thoughts:\n\n* Agile included the concept of a self organizing team for a reason. Do you understand the reasons? Do you agree with them?\n* A specific case, Scrum, provides the role of Scrum Master to support team, remove roadblocks, etc. A SM is deliberately a role with no authority, so as not to undermine the autonomy of the team. \n* A team manager is often a corporate necessity, not a team necessity. \n* Corporate reasons for the existence of a manager often boil down to having one neck to choke. In more sane organizations you also need someone to form budgets, handle HR tasks such as reviews and salaries, oversee hiring decisions, equipment and software purchases, etc.\n* On to your questions:\n   * If a developer is stuck, I would expect them to reach out to the remainder of the team to help them become unstuck. I would expect the other members of the team to stop what they are doing and address the issue. It may not require the entire team, but I expect the team to do something about it. \n   * Does the tech lead step in first? Who cares? Sure. But why not someone else? \n   * Does the engineering manager monitor and intervene? Monitor sure. Intervene? That's trickier. For something as simple as a team member being stuck, I would consider it a failure if a manager needed to get involved. \n   * How do you balance autonomy and accountability? Command and control is not really accoutability. If I'm on a team and I want to get shit done, I hold myself accountable and I hold my teammates accountable. \n* Let's cut the bullshit for a sec. Assuming you're on a half way competent team, what exactly are you expecting the manager to do for you? If the manager is the technical resource you need to unstuck a developer you have a bigger problem than you think. \n* A good Scrum Master, to use as an example, should be working to make themselves unnecessary. In that sense, so should a good engineering manager. \n* There's an old agile model for team maturity: Forming-Storming-Norming-Performing. Interventions by a manager (or SM for that matter) need to be made in the context of where the team is maturity wise and balance the risks of intervening and preventing the team from learning. Sometimes you may have to take the wheel when the team seems intent on driving into a bridge abutment. Or do you? That depends on your context.",

It works in theory with a group of senior engineers who trust each other and have years of shared context. That's maybe 5% of teams.\n\nFor the other 95%, \"self-organizing\" means \"no clear leadership and everyone hopes someone else will handle the hard stuff.\"\n\nYour EM staying hands-off isn't a feature of maturity. It sounds like absence disguised as autonomy. There's a massive difference between \"I trust this team to handle it\" and \"I'm too booked to be involved.\" One is leadership. The other is neglect with good branding.\n\nWhat actually works in teams I've seen over 25 years:\n\nThe tech lead handles technical blockers, code quality, and architecture decisions. They're in the code, they know the system, they unblock people because they understand the work. This is day to day.\n\nThe EM handles people, growth, performance, and organizational blockers. They don't need to be in every ceremony. But they need to know what's happening well enough to act when something breaks down. \"Forward performance concerns to me\" is not a performance management strategy. It's outsourcing accountability to the team.\n\nThe \"team swarms\" idea sounds great until you realize that swarming without someone coordinating it is just 4 people context-switching onto a problem that one person with the right knowledge could solve in an hour.\n\nPeer accountability doesn't emerge from a framework. It comes from trust, shared standards, and someone willing to have uncomfortable conversations. If your team isn't there yet, pretending they're self-organizing just delays the problem.",

For any given person, they should have the space to chose how they do their work and some autonomy over what work they do (without the constraints of the org or team). At the same time they are accountable for following org and team rules (follow Definition of Done, take work toward the sprint goal, communicate with team members). \n\nIn a self-organizing team, there is additional autonomy and accountability. The team makes commitments to each other on what work they will get done and how they will collaborate toward the sprint goal. They are given freedom to do that, but then they need to meet their commitments to each other.\n\nIt's worth noting that in Scrum, the team as a whole is eternally accountable for the sprint goal. In mature self-organizing teams, external parties engage with the team and the team sorts out accountability to each other.\n\nI think that gets at the root of your question but you asked about managers. In short, a mature self-organizing team doesn't need one. The teams I've worked with that matured to this point did a lot of different things with their manager depending on what the manager was good at, but almost all moved the manager into a support role. Prof dev, coaching, connecting with the rest of the org, that sort of thing.",

          "text": "In a mature, self-organizing team, the engineering manager role wouldn't be involved in day-to-day delivery work. This doesn't mean the engineering manager wouldn't be involved if they had a dual role, but engineering management would be a strategic function rather than a tactical one.\n\n1-on-1s are a big part of the role. A key component of this is working with individuals to develop skills and explore career growth opportunities within the organization. When development teams or the broader organization lack skills or people in certain roles, the engineering manager works to fill those gaps by finding people to fill those roles, training people, or bringing in new people with the needed skills. Performance management is another aspect, making sure that people are actively participating and taking managerial steps when they aren't.\n\nThere's also a tools and infrastructure aspect. In my experience, managing the development tools and their costs often falls to the engineering manager. If there are any other considerations, such as qualifying and approving the use of tools on internal systems, that would also be part of the role.\n\nAlthough self-organization is good, the team also needs to serve the business. An engineering manager would be responsible for any guardrails or constraints on the process that the team needs to be aware of, such as compliance requirements.\n\nWith the right structures and temperament, an engineering manager could also function as a coach. Consider LeSS, [which has found that a Scrum Master could serve up to 3 development teams working on a single product](https://less.works/less/framework/scrummaster). My experience suggests that a person can support 4-5 teams if the teams are sufficiently mature and self-organizing at the day-to-day operational level. This pairs well with handling some people-management functions, tools, and process guardrails. However, not everyone has the mindset and approach to primarily sit in coaching, facilitation, and perhaps advising roles.",

          "text": "In any organization, engineering management should be focused on the 'how' more than the 'what,' and also with some aspects of the 'who.'\n\nShould your engineering manager be directly involved with team-level Scrum ceremonies? Certainly, as an observer, at times. Depending on the size of the group, the hands-on engineering manager may be a part of the team (as a Developer and/or Scrum Master, not a manager). Some managers struggle with leaving their manager hat at the door, some are naturally leaders and mentors instead of supervisors and task assigners.\n\nI've been an engineering manager with Scrum teams, where I served primarily as a coach with team level Scrum Masters and Product Owners, fully embracing self-management (the team figures out how to do things and how to allocate the work across the team) while also implementing and enforcing Definition of Done rules, e.g., coding standards, unit test requirements, policies on dealing with bugs, etc. There's a key rule: we manage things, we lead people. As a manager, my job was to create a framework (system) that my teams could effectively function in and succeed, and then to help them effectively utilize that system with advice and impediment resolution support when issues couldn't be handled by them. I think this is a good spot for a first level manager.\n\nConcerning involvement with team iteration events, with the exception of the retrospective all meetings are open to everyone in the interest of transparency, yet only team members can actively engage. In my role as coach and facilitator (not driver) I did attend most daily Scrums and all of the other events. Again, this requires that the manager remember that mentoring and coaching is much more powerful and effective than dictating process and outcomes. Some people can do it, some can be mentored and coached to do it, some people cannot do it.\n\nTo the OP: your manager seems to be very hands-off, which is good (doesn't unnecessarily interfere with the team) and bad (the team seems to be looking for leadership and mentoring and isn't getting it). Your manager needs to recognize that leadership is needed, that the team is looking for someone who will not step in and solve their problems but who can help by using mentoring and coaching techniques, e.g., the Socratic Method, to fully engage the team and teach them how to address their issues.",

              "text": "I've had tremendous experience with Scrum and Kanban, and have read the book on Shape Up. I think the contrast between Scrum and Shape Up is really a contrast in how many people (incorrectly) implement Scrum.\n\nA team is going to produce as much as it can over a fixed duration using a specific process/approach, regardless of their specific process. Shape Up says that these 6-week commitments will be made 'as a matter of honor.' I don't buy that. What I don't like about Shape Up is, I won't know how the teams are doing against the plan until the 6 weeks are up; with Scrum and running two week sprints, I know in 2 weeks whether we're ahead, on, or behind our predicted schedule. Not so I can beat the team up, but so I can update forecasts, adjust planning, etc. \n\nIn real life, much of the functionality we want to build for a new product, or a new release, is necessary, so how much time it's worth is irrelevant... if you need it you need it regardless of how much time it takes. Getting it done, quickly and efficiently is what matters. What happens if the leadership decided that something is worth 6 weeks, the teams spend 6 weeks working on it, and it's not done? If it's truly worth it, you spend another 6 weeks! Really, this 'how much time' question is about setting priorities, not scope.\n\nWhen people mention the unnecessary overhead of Scrum, I shake my head. Scrum done properly, running 2-week sprints, has about 4 hours over an 80-hour work period... about 5% of overall time. If done correctly, this doesn't even take away actual working time. Most people come into the office (or start work) by grabbing a cup of coffee, checking their email, maybe a quick chat with coworkers... and then they start their work period. Have your daily Scrum 15 minutes after the beginning of work hours and get it over quickly... 10 to 15 minutes MAX... and then people can come to work, grab a coffee, quickly check their email, and go to the meeting, and be heads down and working a half hour after the start of the day. If that little bit of overhead destroys your productivity... well, I don't believe it.\n\nIs Shape Up better than dysfunctional Scrum. Surely. But, why not follow a functional optimal Scrum process instead?",

There Story points are a measure of effort.\n\nFor some, story points represent the value added to the product more than the required input. Bug fixing is not value addition, it is value repair. Hence there is no need to add story points. So fixing bugs means you sacrifice value addition for value maintenance. Often teams then also dont give story points to things like package updates and other tech maintenance work.\n\nMy personal preference is to only give story points to bugs and maintenance when the team needs it to determine if we have space to fix a bug in a coming iteration while also still moving the work on our product goals forward, and not to add story points to bugs that are found and quickly fixed within the current iteration. \n\nAs long as these work items are a clearly different type of item than normal value creation tasks, both sides are pleased. That way you can have both the measure of effort and planning number, as well as a way to measure what you add in value and what you need to spend to keep the product as stable as possible.",

It's all about the perspective.\n\nWith sprint user stories, you preemptively do technical research to understand how much effort is going to be required to implement said user story.

You cannot say how many story points it'd take as you don't know, you're guessing. After investigating you can tell, but at that point you're mid way through fixing the bug. Also very much depends on the bug. What's the surface area, the severity, impact... and if you need to fix prod. data then that's another 2 SP if not more (depending on conditions).\n\nThat's why we don't story point bugs. Some are 1SP, some are 4SP+. You could easily mislabel 8SP bug as 2 SP because you haven't investigated yet. That's half a day turning into 2 full work days bug.\n\nThere's always a reason. Better to be safe than sorry. I'd be slapping 4sp on most bugs if I were told to story point them lol. And guess what, I'd probably still be underestimating.\n\nI built sprintflint.com with story points in mind.

Just follow scrum until you understand the rules, then eventually you start bending them and not even needing them (Dreyfus model of skill acquisition).\n\nUsing story points is closer to heresy because even the inventor of story points said they were a stupid idea. In history they've just been used to get management off developers backs because managers want time estimations and developers don't want to, so they invented this abstract notion of complexity + time that makes no sense.\n\nBug tickets don't need story points. User stories don't need story points. But a bug ticket is an investigation. It's a bug of an unknown origin. You have no idea what's wrong. Why guess points for a ticket that you have no idea how to solve until you dig into it?\n\nBut in the end if it works for the team, use them. If they don't, don't use 'em.

The fix itself is usually tiny in comparison. It's impossible to meaningfully estimate an effort that can take anywhere from minutes to days.\n\nAlso unlike new fuctionality (where you generally have a working process and just want to transition to a more convenient process) bugs can have much more significant business impacts. If there is a fire and you have to evacuate the building, you're not going to estimate how many story points that's going to consume.

This allows a developer to estimate whether it will fit within the sprint or not. Ultimately, all story points are are estimates of whether or not a work item will fit within a sprint window. It's a measure of risk.\n\nA bug or defect usually occurs because of some unknown reason so the risk of it not fitting within a sprint window is incredibly high. Also, the fact that the root cause is unknown makes it impossible for a dev to accurately estimate risk. This is typically why O&M teams tend to manage everything using a simple kanban board, completely doing away with sprints and story points.",

This often leads to reduced focus due to hidden work in progress and a chronic underestimation of the maintenance workload, while at the same time stakeholders draw incorrect conclusions from the reported metrics, which as a consequence causes unnecessary friction. And yes, this becomes particularly problematic in scaled organizations, where metrics and reports are often a more dominant indicator of project and team health than direct input, contextual understanding, or a realistic assessment of actual capacity and outcomes.\n\n**TLDR**: If bugs consume sprint capacity but are not reflected in planning, velocity becomes misleading, hidden WIP increases, and stakeholders draw incorrect conclusions.

Of course you don't need to estimate every damn bug there is. What I was saying here that I think a hard-line policy of attaching 0 points to a bug is an anti patterns which I've seen play out in practice more than one time.\n\nBack in the days when I was a lead developer, our rule of thumb was say - if the work e.g. refactoring or I guess bug fixing (we didn't have so many of those) was going to take half a day or more, we would factor that into (sprint-level) planning.\n\n\nAnd I've had arguments with product where the amount of time all the various people involved have spent debating e.g. should we upgrade React etc took more capacity and time from those individuals than actually doing the work would do. \n\n\nYou just need to be sensible about these things. But one of the most recent senior engineering managers who reported to me had a \"we don't point bugs\" rule and on the legacy undocumented codebase his team were responsible for maintaining (without even being familiar with the languages), guess what - this policy made no sense and that team were barely getting anything across the line (while signing themselves up to all sorts of other work).\n\n\nPick the context that works for your team.\n\n\nBut don't let dogmatism and purity of principles get in the way of doing \"the right thing\", whatever that may be for that team in that org.",

This way, the dev team knows that the bug does really need to be fixed during that sprint.

That means you can use valuable working software as a probe to uncover the actual needs of users, because if you are wrong, it's not expensive, hard, slow or risky to change it.\n\n**2.  Theory-X management need not apply.**  High performance comes from unlocking intrinsic motivation of teams - broadly that means STOPPING the things that demotivate them or mean they are disengaged as a start point.  You need to lead, not manage.\n\n**The key shift in thinking is away from scope, budget and time.**\n\nEach Sprint/Iteration is a small project, where you create (and measure) benefits created so far, and check the assumptions made when you started.  You can extend scope, pivot to a new direction, or decide to end now and give the team a more valuable project to work on, based on what you now know.\n\nIn that sense scope, budget and time are all flexible, and you opt to invest one Sprint at a time, and review what to do next with all of the stakeholders.   The goal is not efficient delivery, but enabling \"off ramps\" from the programme  that have zero cost, every few weeks.\n\nAgile methods were called \"lightweight\" for this reason.",

Get the basics right first.**  \n  \nThink you are bit confused here   \n  \n\\- **XP was one of the lightweight frameworks** \\- along with Crystal and Scrum - that become known as \"agile\";  there were more XP authors of TMFASD than Scrum ones;\n\n\\- **all agile approaches draw down on Lean ideas,** along with theory-of-constraints, \"the learning organisation\" and so on, to a greater or less extent, so \"agile Vs lean\" is a false dichotomy;  \n  \n**Agile and waterfall approaches take a fundamentally different approach to business risk.**  \n  \nWaterfall is contractual, and tends to drive an adversarial approach between customer and team  \nAgility is collaborative, and tends to drive a cooperative approach between customer and team.  \n  \n  \n**By being able to change direction \"on a dime, for a dime\" and eliminate sunk costs**, we mange the overall financial risk of delivery - especially in a **high risk, high reward, early technology and innovation domain** \\- much more effectively.  \n  \nThat said, agile approaches require three main things to be effective  \n  \n**- a Theory-Y culture / learning organsiation approach**  \n**- you can make change cheap, easy, fast and safe (no new defects)**  \n**- you get fast feedback from users on the value created by that change**  \n  \nIf you don't have those three, then forget about any agile approach.  \nIt won't help you reduce business risk in any way;  you have zombie-scrum and agile-theater.  \n  \nYou will slide towards bigger batches, and formal requiments and UAT, and all that expensive, slow bureaucracy.  \nOr you will go bankrupt - slowly then rather quickly - as you burn through investors money with no profit.\n\n**A lot of agile transformations wind up here because of that first point.**  \nIt's often a direct result of the second, which is technological and skill based.\n\n**Agility is developer driven, and based on the core XP practices,** or your teams ability to refactor a complex legacy code base to make it CHeFS to work on - not expensive, hard, slow and risky to change.  \n\n**But the third matters a lot too.**  Until you have feedback, it's just \"inventory\" - product bloat you are paying for in the hope it will \"wash its face\" one day. Continuous deployment means just that.  XP has an onsite customer, embedded with a team, co-creating. Scrum suggests you aim at multiple increments released in a Sprint, to get feedback on the Sprint Goal.   \n  \nIn general that's my starting point - do we tick those three boxes?  \nOr, can we get there. \n\nIf not, then you are in that contractual, avoid-being-the-scapegoat space.  \nWhich means slow, bloated bureaucratic waste, so everyone feels safer.",

Agile is also not a methodology, it's a way of thinking expressed in principles that emphasizes improving the ability to respond effectively to change. Most people who say they're \"doing Agile\" are actually using some form of Scrum (that may be more or less faithful to the Scrum Guide).\n\nSAFe (Essential SAFe, the first level of the framework and the one that is most-implemented) is a framework that sits on top of the teams and is meant for large multi-team projects. SAFe has its own training for Scrum and Kanban... go to Scrum Alliance, [Scrum.org](http://Scrum.org), or [Scrum.Inc](http://Scrum.Inc), or Kanban University for training in Scrum or Kanban. Although I've had several engagements where I helped organizations struggling with SAFe (I have my own approach to fixing SAFe I call SAFeR), I'm not a SAFe fan. There are better ways to scale... more lightweight, more effective. My own approach, developed in the early 2010s, focuses on a Product Owner Council with a Chief Product Owner, and has a Chief Scrum Master with team-level Scrum Masters. We run two levels of refinement: project/release refinement and team-level refinement. We hold daily Scrums, with the last Scrum being a leadership Scrum (all POs, all Scrum Masters, plus functional leads and managers, facilitated by the Chief Scrum Master) which runs like a Kanban standup. This approach has worked well for me in many organizations and has resulted in significant quality and throughput increases, as well as increased team morale.\n\nXP has mostly been absorbed into Scrum by having its key practices integrated by teams into their Scrum implementations... pair programming, TDD, CI, refactoring, collective code ownership, etc. That makes sense when you realize that Scrum is a team-level project management process wrapper while XP practices are good engineering practices for software development.\n\nKanban (the Kanban Method) is a collection of of practices and techniques based on principles from many different approaches, primarily Lean/TPS and Theory of Constraints, along with some original work on product management, leadership, and metrics. The Kanban Method is orthogonal to Agile frameworks and can be used within, alongside, and above these frameworks. My scaling approach has a lot of Kanban baked in as the glue that aligns and coordinates teams.\n\n  \nRe jargon, you only see jargon among the Agile geeks. I will say that the difference between failing Scrum adoptions at the beginning of my engagements and successful Scrum at the end is the faithful application of practices based on principles and the insistence on facing and fixing problems.\n\n",

Everyone on the team must care about the product because code only matters when it delivers user value, and teams that understand the problem (not just the spec) can pivot when needed. Processes should earn their keep or get cut; ceremony bloat creeps in when no one questions whether a ritual still improves delivery. Communicating down demands transparency — withholding information that affects your reports causes lasting resentment — while communicating up demands a clear structure: context, problem, plan, and what support you need. A manager's time breaks down roughly into 10% player, 30% coach, and 60% cheerleader, with genuine (not ritualistic) praise and making engineers' wins visible beyond the team. The ultimate goal is building a team that thrives without you: delegate relentlessly, stay off the critical path, refuse to become the bus factor of one, and trust your people's effort and honesty while still verifying through both quantitative metrics and the qualitative signals — like who quietly holds the team together — that no \"management AI tool\" can capture.\n\nIf the summary seems inacurate, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually 👍\n\n[^(Click here for more info, I read all comments)](https://www.reddit.com/user/fagnerbrack/comments/195jgst/faq_are_you_a_bot/)",

Different engineers having different standards for acceptable code makes it inconsistent too, some people are sticklers about test coverage and docs while others are more pragmatic about shipping working code even if imperfect.

          "text": "Before discussing reducing time, have you defined why you are conducting a code review? There are several reasons: finding defects, developing a shared understanding of a system's design and implementation, identifying enhancements and opportunities to improve an otherwise working system, and exposing implementation details to testers to move from black-box to white-box testing, just to name a few. Code review, and even different types of code reviews, are better at some of these than others.\n\nOnce you know why you're reviewing the code, do you know how long you're actually spending compared to the value you get from that time? If your purpose is to find defects, how many defects are you finding? If your purpose is to develop a shared understanding, are the people who didn't implement that feature comfortable enhancing that feature in the future? Sometimes, value could be hard to quantify, depending on the reason for review.\n\nGenerally speaking, are you focusing on things that need human eyes during code review? Regardless of when or why you conduct code reviews, automate as much as possible. People shouldn't be looking for style problems. Use a linter and automate code formatting and flag anything that can't be automated before the review starts. Expose code coverage, test results, and static analysis to make sure that there is some confidence that the code is tested and does what it is supposed to do without introducing errors. Tool output can also be provided to the reviewers. Sometimes, I've gotten more value from reviewing a description of the proposed change, a test coverage report, and automated unit and integration test cases to identify missing edge cases than from reading the actual implementation code.",

Painful to enforce for the first month, then it becomes the fastest thing you do because reviewers actually understand what they're looking at.\n\nThe other thing that helps is separating what the review is for. Architectural decisions should not be made during code review, that's too late, the code is already written. If the approach is wrong at that stage you're not reviewing, you're rewriting. Architecture gets discussed before a line is written. Review is for implementation quality only, and that's a much faster conversation.\n\nThe SLA thing is a symptom of the real problem which is that reviewers have no ownership of what they're reviewing. If I'm assigned 12 random PRs this week I'll rubber-stamp them to close the queue, anyone would. If I own the feature and I'm reviewing the implementation, I have a reason to actually read it.\n\nNone of this is a tradeoff, it's just structure.
