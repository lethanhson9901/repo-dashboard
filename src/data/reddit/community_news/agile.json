      "text": "I keep seeing the same pattern across teams. The daily standup starts as a quick sync, but slowly morphs into a round robin status report to the manager. Each person takes their turn listing what they did yesterday and will do today. Everyone else waits quietly. Real blockers are not raised in this format, and collaboration does not happen. The meeting happens every day, but its original purpose to coordinate and unblock the team is gone.\n\nWhat is tricky is that the ritual becomes non negotiable. Suggestions to shorten it, make it asynchronous, or change the structure are often rejected. There is a sense that leadership values the simple visibility of everyone checking in more than the meeting's actual output.\n\nWhat single change had the biggest impact on making a standup like this useful again?",

Fixing it is the easiest part: just look at the tasks on the board instead of focusing on the people. \n\nAsk: why are these tasks still on review after two days? What else is missing so that we can merge them? Why is this task still on “In Progress” after 5 days?\n\nUse your Cycle Time to measure the usual time tasks take until completion, and don’t discuss task that are too new.\n\nCongratulations, your Daily now takes 5 minutes and your developers won’t hate you.\n\nI highly recommend reading anything by Daniel Vacanti to learn more. IIRC Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams covers this, and it’s available for free.",

I go around the room (order is pseudorandom) calling on each dev and  filtering the board for them. \n\nThe meeting does feel more status than coordination. We definitely coordinate in the meeting, but it can devolve. I tend to stop TEM (solving the problem) discussions and move the conversation to after standup (allowing those not involved to drop from the call)  .\n\nI am not sure how to drive more coordination and collaboration into the meeting and into the team. \n\nWe also have a couple of members whose velocity is painfully low.  They're new to the programming language and unfamiliar with the internal company developed framework (i'm coming up to speed on it and I'm not a fan), so I've been slow on initiating the discussion (in the past the teams I've been on we'd handle it at retro) about the velocity . I have asked if stories are detailed enough and if the AC is clear and the team says yes (we've added a couple of things to ensure that). \n\nThoughts?",

Some people would take 90s other would simple say nothing. It was glorious. Worked well for two full years. \n\nOne day an admin decided to pop in to 'ask some questions' immediately the format changed from a standup to a 1hr mandatory status update thing that 100% could have been covered entirely by jira. We kept asking admins to stop popping in but they felt it was the most efficient use of their time to get updates (regardless of the fact it clearly was being used for a social hour). \n\nI stopped attending altogether, started a new 'standup' with the original format explicitly not listing it on the public calendar. Sure enough admin found out and started attending that, turning it yet again into a social hour yet now we had two distinct social hours on the books every single day. Wtf. \n\nLeft for greener pastures. If admin is allowed to control or attend a standup, there really is no avoiding turning it into a roundtable status update that is going to be littered with those unnecessary friendly topics like what did you do over the weekend or how your kids are. That has no place in a standup, it's not a blocker and irrelevant to my life entirely. I certainly don't need a status update on your kids everyday.",

If they don't value it, they wont. But teams tend to perpetuate value without any convincing, and stop useless meetings all the same.\n\nA publication \"The anatomy of social dynamics in escape rooms\" described different teams solving escape rooms. Escape rooms are self-managing self-leading teams, just as is in agile, and it is an example of the dynamics that managers tend to fail to imitate; \"teams tend to start the game with a high amount of group interactions. This pattern is associated with teams ‘warming up’, familiarizing themselves with the environment, and discussing together a strategy. Such a number falls abruptly after the first 5 min, reflecting division of work and individual focus.\"",

That includes releasing increments inside the Sprint cycle for feedback.  The Sprint Goal is part of an outcome-oriented roadmap, not just delivering backlog, and you replan every day based on what you now know.\n\n**- if you are using Kanban, focus on flow**  \nUse visual management;  the board tells the status, not the developer.  The emphasis is on \"stop starting, start finishing\" and how the team will collaborate, as a team, to focus on closing work.  That means swarming onto blockers, for example, while keeping WIP down, and managing any hand-offs or urgent items.\n\n\\- **use XP (Extreme Programming) Practices**  \nStatus-report daily scrums are usually a sign that you have individuals working on big chunks of work.  That feels like \"efficiency\", but in practice it's setting you up for longer inspect-and-rework loops or just building the wrong thing and finding out slowly. This is **exactly** what agile approaches should avoid, and why Extreme Programming (XP) was one of the original \"lightweight\" methods.  Slice small, use pairing, have an onsite customer to collaborate with and deliver outcomes. \n\nOf those, getting the XP stuff right is the bottom line in agility.  You need to  \n\n**- make change cheap, easy fast and safe (no new defects)**  \n**- get fast feedback from users on the value that change created**\n\nThis is very hard, and requires a lot of discipline and practice to get right.    \n  \nThe pay off tends to be autonomy.  \n  \nWhen it's not expensive, hard, slow and risky to fix problems, then managers fell much safer and don't need to micro-manage.

I looked everywhere on the site could not find any download links. I did see a renewal for version 6 and was not interested in being ropped out of another 300$ dollars and time.\n\nSo then I reached out to support. The level 1 personnel told me he could also not access the .pdf and I had to renew to have access to an old, expired, certifications I had earned. I explained I was not interested in the new material and simply wanted what I paid for. I had to insist on escalation to somebody who did have the authority. According to current law and buisness this was bad practice. \n\nWorth inquiring with the \\[BBB.org\\](https://www.bbb.org/us/co/boulder/profile/business-development/scaled-agile-inc-1296-1000123264) right? They are already UNTRUSTED with a C- as of early 2026.\n\nLevel 2 also tried to explain to me that the system was locked up behind the renewal paywall and they also could not provide the old certification. I asked them if they practiced Agile at their offices or that was in the title only.\n\nAfter finding them on Google maps. I found I was not the only person with bad support issues.

Agility drew very heavily on his \"lean\" concepts and ideas.\n\nI learned a LOT working in a SAFe environment, but none of that was SAFe specific.\n\nA lot of the desperate \"pearl clutching\" reactions tend to miss that most of SAFe is just other people's ideas, rebranded.\n\nFor example, an \"Agile Release Train\" is really just \"The Spotify Model\" that everyone was gushing over back in 2017 or so, just with more boring, corporate sounding names.  \n\n\nSAFe training - like Scrum training - is really about everyone agreeing to use a certain terminology, and not changing what those words mean. \"Minimum Viable Product\" anyone?  \n  \nAnd very little of it has to do with the actual practical side of agility, Extreme Programming (XP) and more latterly DevOps.

Anyone willing to sit on a bug for 3 months has either already churned, or it’s not really important to solve because the workaround is easy.\n\nThe remainder - what are you measuring their impact against? That’s the real question to have a good answer for before you start. If it’s conversion, rank them in severity of how they impact that. If it’s revenue retention, speak to Account Managers to figure out the churn risk of customers.\n\nI don’t recommend getting too granular. High/Med/Low impact should be enough of a prioritisation. If you find too many in one bucket, you should recalibrate your thresholds. Generally, I’d keep it 10% high, 30% medium and 60% low. Those might feel like arbitrary buckets but you cannot have 100 high impact bugs, you need to keep recalibrating your scale until only the most severe issues are considered “high”.",

Perhaps it's my background in regulated industries, but failure to report a known issue with a system would be a pretty serious non-compliance with regulations or contracts.\n\nHowever, they aren't wrong in that the first step should be a rapid cleanup of the known issues.\n\nAnything that doesn't have enough information to let someone knowledgeable in the system attempt to reproduce it can be closed. If there aren't good preconditions and reproduction steps, there's no need to waste anyone else's time. Without this information, not only will it be hard to reproduce in a development environment, but confirming the fix will also be difficult.\n\nAs a parallel activity, consider setting standards for new issues. Make sure that anything that is newly reported has enough information to reproduce, fix, and verify the solution. Don't accept defect reports that don't have the necessary information.\n\nYou also have another opportunity to close issues quickly. If the feature the defect was reported against no longer exists, you can close it. Features are deprecated all the time, and one problem I've seen is that when a feature is deprecated, the backlog work associated with it isn't cleaned up. Not only can reported defects be closed, but any ideas for enhancements or tech debt paydown can also be closed, since they're now irrelevant.\n\nInstead of categorizing by impact and priority, I'd start with something more objective. Can you check that each defect is associated with one or more features or architectural elements of the system? If so, do that. Then, you can prioritize defect repair with planned feature development. If you have planned work associated with a given feature, pull defects associated with that feature at the same time. Use this time to conduct a deeper analysis, close irrelevant defects, and fix those that need to be fixed. This also gives you a prioritization method, especially if you know the value of or risks associated with a particular feature. Instead of categorizing each defect, you cluster and improve an aspect of the system.",

That way, if you make a determination that a bug isn’t worth spending time on, you can reject it now, and get it off your open backlog. \n\nThe big advantage of this approach is for later trend analysis. Right now, it might seem like that bug isn’t worth fixing — and maybe that’s the right decision! But if it turns out that you’re getting a steady trickle of reports of what amounts to the same bug, then maybe this “minor” issue is more significant than it seemed at first, and it’s worth working on after all. \n\nDeleting the bug reports is bad, because it discards this information and makes later analysis difficult or impossible. \n\nSo my approach is fairly simple — review the bugs, reject the ones that don’t seem worth working on any time soon, and focus on the remaining high-priority issues.

Because it is impossible to order 400 bugs. At best you can put them into a few categories.\n\n\nFinally, the only real metric is importance. And how your project determines that will be somewhat unique for your project. Bugs that completely prevent a feature from working are probably high on the list. But maybe there are features no one really uses. Or maybe there's a feature one person uses, but they're a VIP.\n\n\nI would start with just categorizing as critical or not. Until you've finished the critical ones, there's no point in putting any thought into the rest. Once the criticals are resolved you can lower the importance bar and do another batch of most important. I would generally aim for about 2 sprints worth of the most important bugs actually being ordered.\n\n\nYour two metrics of impact and priority kind of sound like the same thing. Wouldn't high impact = high priority and low impact = low priority?

Most priority 1 test cases were in the loan configuration module, and each module also had 1 or 2 high priority TC. I say all this because, I heavily researched the bugs that had been historically reported up until current.

How much does it block their work? That usually gets you to a high/medium/low rating faster than elaborate scoring systems. High impact = lots of users or completely blocks a key workflow. Medium = affects some users or creates workarounds. Low = edge cases or minor annoyances.\n\nFor priority, you're essentially deciding \"when should we fix this\" - next sprint, soon, or later. The combination usually shakes out naturally: high impact bugs that are quick wins go in the next sprint, high impact complex problems get scheduled, and low impact items stay in the backlog until you have cycles.\n\nOne approach that works well for big backlogs: start with a quick filtering pass. Anything that hasn't been reported again in your typical release cycle might not need immediate attention. You could also sort by how often the bug appears in support tickets or user reports - bugs that keep surfacing probably deserve prioritization even if they initially seemed minor.\n\nWith 400+ bugs, consider doing a first pass just bucketing things into critical/high/medium/low/obsolete, then spend your detailed triage time on the critical and high buckets. You'll get through the list much faster and make better decisions about what actually needs attention in your next sprint.",

When people discuss servant leadership in regards to scrum or agile, they usually just focus on leaders that concern themselves with the needs of the team to succeed. That's likely why the newest scrum guide dropped the term servant leadership and switched to the awkwardly vague term true leader.\n\nI wouldn't say it is THE approach. There are quite a few theories of leadership out there. The bigger problem is that most managers and business leaders never get any leadership training. I don't know about your experience and I only worked with 5 or 6 German companies, but certainly all of them I worked with were at least trying to consider what their teams needed. Of course, that was during consulting and companies who hire consultants are usually actually trying to change, so my experience is a little skewed.",

That is allowing the team to put their own plans together to take an order and convert it into actions.

You'll probably get fired at some point too.\n\nSo in a \"**situational leadership II**\" context, servant leadership works well when the organisation's maturity level has reached the stage where everything is in that  \"delegating\" phase.  That's similar in intent to Ron Westrum's ideal of \"generative\", (**\"A Typology of Organsiational Cultures\"**, **2004**)  - where the team's job is to escalate systemic issues to leadership, and leadership's job is to fix those issues. (See **\"Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps\", Forsgren et al 2018**)\n\nOften you have to:\n\n\\- start out with the intent;  \n\\- raise the bar through the \"selling\" and \"telling\" phases;  \n\\- \"drive out fear\" (\"**Out of the Crisis!\" W Edwards Deming 1980**)  \n\\- apply individual \"coaching arcs\" to teams and leaders  \n(see **\"Extraordinarily Bad Ass Agile Coaching\" - Galen 2022**)\n\nbefore you can really settle in to that \"servant leadership\" outcome. \n\n**Without that you'll at best see teams become defensive silos with a lot of bureaucratic process control in order to feel safe.  Ask the teams how you can help and they'll lay in more processes and tools, and you will slide into stage-gate waterfall delivery.**\n\nWhen you get there, that's also when an organisation doesn't really need a dedicated Scrum Master or Agile Coach role;  you have hit the whole \"Learning Organisation\" thing (**\"The Fifth Discipline\" - Peter Senge 1990**)",

The responsibility for enoying that moment is the attendees.  \n\nProduct development perhaps requires everyone at the party to be flexible and go with the flow.

Which strategic problems were solved or opportunities were realized?  You're winning an operational game while trying to be promoted into a strategic game.  I don't know if it's too late to capitalize on past success, but going forward be sure to reframe your success in terms of strategic outcomes, not just operational efficiency.\n\nI'm not saying you should leave, but I was in a similar situation and was not promoted until after I left and proved myself at the next employer, where I was intentionally and visibly more strategic.",

We're moving to a private registry for built images.\n * Estimation Issues: Stopping the use of \"distribution factors\" for man-day calculations (it’s been inaccurate) and stopping last-minute sprint backlog changes.\n * Task Management: Developers were juggling multiple user stories simultaneously; we’re moving back to a \"one person, one priority\" flow.\n\nWhat We’re Starting (The Action Plan)\n * Accountability: No more \"ghost tasks\" (work without records) or editing tasks you aren't assigned to.\n * Technical Debt & CI/CD: Cleaning devcontainers every sprint, improving pipelines incrementally, and ensuring test results are visible directly in the MR.\n * Local Dev: Pushing for local development on lightweight projects to save server resources.\n * Communication: Meeting Minutes (MoM) for reviews and reporting unresolved bugs to the Scrum Master at least 2 days before the review.\n\nMy questions : is there anything or weird thing in our sprint retrospective? \n",

Before you make many changes or force strict Scrum rules on people, observe and listen.\n\nYour approach will depend on the team’s past experience and how they work now. It also matters if this is a new team.\n\nSet up 1-on-1s with people inside and outside the team. Ask what works and what does not work. Ask how open they are to change and what you should focus on first. This does not mean they are right or that you must do what they say. It will, however, give you very useful input for your next steps.\n\nTo answer your specific questions:\n\n1. For stand-ups, try to keep them short. If they already do daily stand-ups, keep the format until you know what works in their context. Check if one person runs the meeting, if there are too many people, and if it is a status report instead of a focus on blockers and teamwork.\n\n2. I prefer shorter iterations, (1-2 weeks). I plan ceremonies in the middle of the week, not Monday or Friday. I also plan prep meetings with the team or with a few people before the main ceremonies.\n\n3. Meet everyone on the team in 1-on-1s. Also meet key people outside the team. You can ask the team who those people are.\n\nGood luck!",

That framing already assumes the wrong problem.\n\nIn Scrum, prioritisation is an **accountability**, not a voting exercise and not a power grab.\n\nPolitically, it maps closest to **technocracy with delegated authority**: decisions are made by the person accountable for outcomes, informed by evidence and expertise, and constrained by transparency, not popularity.\n\nThe Product Owner is accountable for maximising value. That means:\n\n* synthesising customer evidence, market signals, risk, and constraints\n* making trade-offs explicit\n* ordering work based on outcomes, not volume or loudness\n\nTeams don't vote on priorities because accountability without decision authority is meaningless. But equally, good Product Owners don't operate in isolation. They rely on:\n\n* Developers to surface technical risk and feasibility\n* Stakeholders to provide context and demand signals\n* Evidence from real usage to invalidate assumptions\n\nWhen prioritisation feels authoritarian, it's usually because strategy is unclear, feedback loops are weak, or the backlog is treated as a demand intake queue instead of a hypothesis list.\n\nWhen it feels like democracy, it's often because no one is actually accountable for outcomes.\n\nThe healthy pattern is neither.\n**Accountable technocracy under transparent constraint.**\n\nIf prioritisation can't be explained in terms of value and learning, it's broken, regardless of who made the call.",

You don't have to decode metaphors about anchors and winds to figure out what to work on next.\n\nI also think elaborate formats can feel a bit performative after a while - the novelty wears off and then you're stuck with something complicated that's also stale. Plus/delta just... keeps working.\n\nNot saying the other formats are bad - sailboat can be great for a change of pace - but for week-in-week-out retros, simple wins.",

          "text": "The most useful tool I've found is what I call a Feelings Map because I don't know what it's really called. Basically you plot out the timeline of the project on the x axis with a few key milestones or events identified, then you ask everyone to draw a line indicating how they felt along the way with the y axis going from Fantastic at the top to Scared/Awful/Gonna Lose My Job at the bottom. \n\nThen you, the facilitator, looks for insights or key overlapping sentiments and uses those as discussion points for the group, recording those insights, actions, or learnings along the way. \n\nThis works great at a whiteboard. I've never seen this implemented digitally. ",

Emotional trajectory over time surfaces patterns that point-in-time formats miss.\n\nHave you found this works better for longer retrospectives (end of project/quarter) vs sprint retros? Seems like it needs more time to map and discuss than a standard 2-week sprint retro would allow",

Keeps things fresh for the team.  \n\nHaving said that, I'll sometimes do a picture/gif retrospective - either offer \\~4 different pictures, and ask people which one represents the past sprint for them the most, or ask folks to find and share a picture or gif of how they felt.  For the former approach, it's interesting to see what different elements people pick out that resonate with them.  For the latter, it can be a little silly and a fun icebreaker, but may not get the deepest, most meaningful results.  However, it can give folks a chance to vent a bit and get some things off their chest (hopefully with a laugh!), paving the way to a more robust conversation where you dig out action items and process improvements.",
