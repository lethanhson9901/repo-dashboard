Removes a constraint\n2. Fixes a limiting factor\n3. Increases the system’s ability to create value\n\nEverything else is just activities without impact  \nand often costs teams and companies time, effort, and money.\n\nMy 2 cents:\n\nBefore changing anything, ask:\n\n1. What is actually limiting us right now from creating more of what we want to create?\n2. Why will this change help?\n\nRemember:\n\n* Over-production is waste.\n* And over-improvement can become waste too.",

I can't make many definitive general observations, but I see a lot of similar patterns.\n\nWhat I see in the situation you describe is a leader whose institutional or regional culture values [individualism over long-term orientation](https://geerthofstede.com/culture-geert-hofstede-gert-jan-hofstede/6d-model-of-national-culture/), who is compromising their role either through ignorance, hubris, or fear of losing their job. Or, more likely, a mix of all three! I've seen that behaviour in Project Managers in a Software House using Waterfall; it's orthogonal to agility: it's simply despair.\n\nThe [Hersey-Blanchard Model](https://experianta.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Situational-Leadership-Theory.png) can help leaders \\*or their people\\* increase autonomy by building trust. The best Scrum Masters and coaches build trust (the person you're describing is destroying trust by over-controlling your team). A way through the conflict is to negotiate greater autonomy through increasing trust - sometimes our leaders don't lead; that's when new leaders reveal themselves.",

If you have yearly budget have a fiction section.\n  estimated ROI of a feature (in $)\n  roadmap (if the PO is milling around support tasks and the product stagnating)\n  Impact maps - state objectives, business value and explore with teams.\n\nTo get a team to do this autonomously is a full time job, to get it to stick, it has to be their idea, if it's their idea who's going to sing your praises? So the data is important, the context can come from the actions in retrospectives - another pitfall is people cramming retros with actions, I prefer one action (ideally the biggest impact but team confidence will fluctuate and a keep the process goal is ok from time to time).",

          "text": ">**Payment Triggers:** If you are delivering incrementally (e.g., every 2 weeks), do you actually invoice every 2 weeks?\n\nIn my experience, organizations, especially larger enterprises, have policies around how they pay. In one organization, outside of paying for specific jobs (think facilities services, or from software/IT, a penetration test with a defined scope), it was a pain to have a contract that was less than a year. When we wanted to buy a SaaS product, if the vendor didn't have the desired terms, we needed to use a reseller. Paying per iteration is probably the most by-the-book \"Agile\", it's also not necessarily the most realistic.\n\nDepending on the context, you also may want to separate iteration from incremental delivery. Is your customer really accepting a delivery every 2 weeks? You may be getting feedback every 2 weeks, but you may only be delivering to production every month or two or even three. Not all customers want frequent production changes, outside of resolving critical defects and security patches.\n\nShort story: you'll probably need to separate payment cycles from your development process and account for this in the agreements and contracts, especially what happens (penalties and refunds) if they want to end the arrangement early for any reason.  \n\n\n>**The \"Half-Done\" Problem:** In civil, if a contractor leaves, usually a consulting firm hired by the contractee measure what they built and approve the payment. In software, if a vendor delivers \"90% of a feature\" and leaves, that 90% is often useless to the next vendor (who might want to rewrite it). How do you protect against paying for \"useless 90% code\"?\n\nMost of my experience is in fields where the customer doesn't get the software. They are either buying a physical product (sometimes configured to meet a particular customer's needs) that contains software or they are buying software as a service. In these cases, this isn't applicable.\n\nThe \"Agile\" answer goes back to your first question. If you're paying often, you're seeing at least demonstrations of working software very quickly and understanding the cost. You can compare value to cost and end the arrangement if things seem to be going out of control. But, seeing my answer to that part, plenty of organizations choose not to work that way, meaning they don't see the financial benefits of very short iterations and small increments.\n\nIf you are working in a situation where you deliver code to a customer, it would be on them to work with future vendors to understand the implications of using that code versus throwing it away and starting again. If you're outsourcing software development, you probably don't have the technical resources to evaluate the technical decisions made, so I'm not sure what options are available to protect yourself.  \n\n\n>**Bidding:** Do you bid purely on hourly rates? Or do clients demand a \"Fixed Price\" for a scope that hasn't been designed yet? How it mainly works in contracts?\n\nI've usually seen time-based rates for SaaS products that account for the teams supporting the product, infrastructure costs, growth, and profit margins. For custom or configured software, it was usually a cost-plus contract, either a fixed fee or goal-based incentives, with a set timeline for renewing the contract.",

About a year in total.\n\nThere was no acceptance step with the client-side project team we directly worked with. They only got a high-level work log (\"X hours spent on doing migrations, Y hours on solving issues / doing custom solutions, Z hours on project management\"). They knew the rest due to daily stand-ups, dashboards showing completed migration ticket numbers, and a weekly status report. There was a formal signoff on the invoice amount, but that did not relate to looking at our work directly. Just normal corporate stuff. \n\nWe did UAT at the end-user level (\"Is it all still there and the latest version?\"), but they had no authority in the project or the cost.\n\nAnother team in my company had a similar project that was paid on migration tickets completed instead of time and material. But that was always considered the client having raked us over the coals. It was the status of *their messed-up server* environment that caused a lot of extra working hours. So *they* have to deal with the extra cost.\n\nGenerally, in consulting it's better to charge based on effort, not outcome. You have to deal with somebody else's shit, and the causer of that shit should bear the (financial) burden. If you work in your own environment as a normal developer, that might be a less clear-cut, because now the server-mess delay is your own fault.",

We're not reporting them to anyone.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, that's about the business outcomes we are trying to create.  \n  \nAgain, that varies with organizational and product strategy, but these are closer to \"metrics\";  they tend to boil down to the business benefits created in some way: \n\n\\- saves time (ie opportunity cost decrease)  \n\\- saves money (ie actual cost decrease)  \n\\- makes money (ie revenue increase)   \n\\- reduces risk (of slips, lapses, mistakes, rework as well as cyber etc)  \n\\- durability (extension of product lifecycle)  \n\\- convenience (UX)  \n\\- prestige (brand, status or ego)",

For those, check Evidence Based Management for metrics that can drive your product  development in a more healthy way. On a team level, flow metrics are much more valuable since they are focused on the throughput of value rather than activity.\n\nThere's is one central question you should ask yourself regarding metrics: with what intent are you measuring?\n\nMost organizations you will find they measure to exert control. They mean to ensure teams are producing enough to keep the money printer going. Aside from the obvious lack of trust this lays bare (and trust is the foundation for any agile enterprise to succeed) it also evokes Goodheart's Law. For those not familiar with it:\n\n>*\"****When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure****\"*\n\nMeasuring to control, reward or punish basically means that any metric will be gamed for the advantage of the people at the receiving end. This is where you get your watermellon reports from (green on the outside, red on this inside)\n\nHowever, if you leverage metrics for learning instead, there is no incentive to bullshit the results. In fact, it incentives to create more accurate data in order to perform better, increase flow, and create better, more satisfying outcomes. This of course requires that the organization *trusts* teams (and the people that compose them) to do the right things.",

The wanted behavior is that there is no spillover, since it restricts the amount of high prio work we can pick next sprint. This is trivial to achieve regularly when teams know how to slice items mid sprint.\n\n\n\n\nBacklog Ranking of items picked for next sprint. The goal is to pick the top items. If the picked items are #3 and #4, we should ask why #1 & #2 were passed over. The wanted behavior is that teams respect the po's priority as much as possible.

          "text": "Appreciate the thoughts here, but... when it comes to metrics, everyone does them backwards!!!\n\nPeople always first identify the metric they want to track and then they move forward and eye it continuously to make sure the metric meets their interpretation. Wrong!!!\n\nFirst, you have to state - WHAT IS THE PROBLEM YOU\"RE TRYING TO SOLVE?\n\nThen, you can select the metrics that help baseline the problem and also metrics that would help track improvement. \n\nBut, the biggest failure is assuming that one or a few metrics are needed to create a picture. No. Its almost like the laws of forces in physics - \"every action has an equal and opposite reaction\". Tweaking one metric and optimizing one thing - usually triggers de-optimization of another. \n\nFor example, if you want to improve quality, get ready for slower pace of work, get ready for less new things getting done, get ready to direct more attention to bugs and support cases, which again lead to slowing down the pace of developing new things. \n\nThe next thing - how you track things is important. Do you track of averages, or do you look at specific work item and how each went? Because averages will get you in trouble. Don't focus on averages, focus on those where things are wrong. Imagine target shooting, if you keep hitting the grouping, that's not bad. To improve, focus on addressing the shots outside the grouping.\n\nSo the metrics here identified as the \"RIGHT\" metrics. Not really, they are just \"another set\" of metrics.\n\nFlow time --> how long work actually takes   >>> first, lets define it right, its now how long it takes, its how long it takes to get to the customer in production. Which is basically cycle-time + deployment time, or implementation time. Why is this important? Do you really need to track every work item delivery to the customer? Why? Customer doesn't care about all items equally. Maybe if you're running a tech consultancy, or custom dev shop, but otherwise, not really important IMHO.\n\nThroughput --> how many items are finished per unit of time >>> Unless you're following #noestimates, this serves no value. Especially if you pick up varying amounts of different type of work, because you can't decompose everything into equally measurable elements of scope. And throughput can be abused no worse than Velocity. \"Why did you guys complete only 15 items instead of throughput of 20 you got every 2 weeks for the past 3 months?\" Shitty question to ask, and even worse to answer. But... it WILL be asked.\n\nWIP --> how much work is started but not finished >>> Do you mean average WIP? Or are you trying to keep track of the limit for one team? Are you trying to track activity across multiple projects and teams to detect lack of organizational focus towards a common goal? WIP by itself is just a number. Its an indicator that serves more the most value while working, not historically from past sprints. Exceed the WIP and hit the limit? Great! Take action. Don't hit the limit for a while and the work is slow? Then limit is too large!\n\nWork item age --> how long current work has been stuck >>> Means nothing if nobody is tracking it and taking action. Not all work is same size. So what's your \"Work Item Age\" red line that has everyone asking questions? And why does the conversation about things needing help are not brought up in the daily? As a matter of fact, running a good daily makes Work Item Age metric obsolete. Its only value is if someone is stepping away from the team for a while and then coming back would like to quickly catch up to understand what's happening. \n\nSo all in all, metrics are important, but not all metrics are equal or better than another in various environments.",

With this education you are able to talk to professionals on a same level, knowing what each terms means exactly and explicitly in order to avoid implicit misconceptions. A few sentences are not enough here to explain the theory and value of a PMP, its knowledge areas, project phases and artifacts. \n\nPractice and experience is equally important, combined with a PMP you will be dream PM for every employer.\n\nSimple example: Scrum Masters without any profound knowledge and certifications, proclaiming themselves as best in practice not needing any classes, are usually the ones who mess everything up. There are too many people in the market with half-baked superficial knowledge talking down the value of certification and education, not willing to invest in these due to lack of will, dedication, putting real effort into something etc. - quick and dirty without sustainability. \n\nI am sure I may get a lot of downvoted for that, but if you want to outstand from the grey mass of pseudo-PMs without any proper education, get a reliable certification and improve yourself on actual professional knowledge.",

The PMP ensures they know the basics or at least been exposed to the concepts. \n\nPerfect? Not by a long shot. But PMP vs non-pmp and I'm more likely to hire the PMP. When there are hundreds of applications coming in it's an easy way to weed out applicants. Won't guarantee you a job, but you're less likely to be tossed out.

We know that some people embellish resumes and others are just \"good interviewers.\" Beyond, but oftentimes including certs, one needs not only proof of work experience, but the requisite soft skills to show one's true potential as a PM. Especially if one is to be leveraged towards critical, complex, and strategic projects in the business.\n\nLet's be honest, the PMP is not easy to get. For the vast majority of people, it takes serious study and rigor. I have never met any PM who achieved the PMP by taking the test cold, without any (or just a little) study. Conversely, I achieved my Scrum Master and Product Owner certs with just a week's worth of study for each (to be fair, those frameworks are light by design which does not make them inadequate). In my program, PMs with a PMP or PRINCE2 - for my European PMs - generally outperform those without them. What we have observed across our PMs is that the cert provides a common framework for governance and execution that is hard to replicate.\n\nBut, do we hire PMs without certification? Absolutely. We still hire uncertified PMs if their communication and skill-specific thought logic show obvious value. If they are the right fit, we will hire a PM and actually pay to get them certified later.\n\nThe PMP isn’t a magic pill, but it’s far from decorative. It’s a tool that, when combined with the right personal/professional attributes, makes a huge difference. Is it the end all, be all? No. It isn't.",

Common examples are tools in the Microsoft ecosystem, the Atlassian ecosystem, and some teams use ONES.com as well. These platforms tend to be powerful enough to cover the workflows you mentioned.\n\nThat said, I wouldn’t be surprised if banks also use more specialized, bank-focused vendor management/procurement systems, since their security and compliance requirements are usually much stricter.\n\nHope this helps as a reference, and I’d love to hear how others handle it too.",

You can't tell me exactly what you need done, so I can't tell you when it will be done.\n\nNow, if you can tell me exactly what needs to be done, don't take an Agile approach. It is inefficient and the benefits aren't needed. However, I'm old enough to remember before Agile and the year after year of projects where \"no, really, we know exactly what we have to do this time\".

Real time cursors and lightweight structure matter more than fancy features.\n\nI’ve found planning improves when the canvas persists after the meeting.
