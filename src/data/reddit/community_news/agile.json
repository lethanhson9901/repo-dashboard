      "text": "The current state of the Agile market - based on conversations I’ve had with hiring managers at Fortune 100 companies.\n\n**Q: Do you need people to implement agile ways of working?**\n\nA: No. We’ve spent the last few years investing in our transformations. Now we just need people to focus on delivering the work.\n\n**Q: What would you like Scrum Masters to focus on?**\n\nA: Helping to put together delivery plans, facilitating the ceremonies, and making sure the work gets delivered on time.\n\n**Q: Is there scope to transform ways of working beyond team level?**\n\nA: No. We already have a framework in place and expect people to work within it. Any change can impact programme-level metrics and be disruptive.\n\n**My take:**\n\n**You can complain on principle that the role is no longer transformation-led. But if that stance doesn’t bring food to the table - and companies clearly don’t want it - what’s the point? You are just spreading misinformation and killing people’s livelihoods.**\n\n**Agile Coaches had the opportunity to coach this properly while leading transformations. Frankly, many messed it up. After all these years, if organisations still don’t understand the Scrum Master role, that failure sits with the people who were meant to teach it and ensure it was implemented correctly.**\n\n**You can’t spend a decade leading transformations, fail to translate the value in business terms, and then be surprised when leadership reverts to delivery-first roles.**",

          "text": "My feelings:\n\n* Agile is basically dead. Oh, there will always be pools of high performing agile organizations that \"get it\". But as a large scale movement? It's dead, Jim.\n* Most organizations have successfully resisted changing to become more agile. If they're lucky, they have pockets of agility encompassing a product, or a team, but the overall impact is probably minor.\n* As you say, most agile coaches/champions failed to convince stakeholders of the benefits of changing, or, if they did, managed to carry through the changes. Whether or not that is the fault of the coaches or if they were mostly doomed from the start, I'm not equipped to judge.\n* I can't simply point to failures at the management level. If you look at the kinds of posts seen here in this sub, and others, it's tragic. Endless arguments over story points. Definitions of Ready and other \"agilified\" phase gates. Cargo cult approaches to methods. Scrum Masters who are essentially meeting schedulers. Complete lack of any sort of organizational feedback loop with actual change.\n* The rank and file of our industry largely rejected adopting agile as well.\n* We never drove the idea that software could be managed like a factory production line out of the industry and, given the current economic trends, it might actually be even more entrenched now. I'm still having arguments about basic ideas like slack in plans that I had two decades ago.\n* I'll always wonder if Beck & co had productized XP in the same way Scrum was productized. Could it have won the agile wars? Probably not. In my experience, most developers talk a good game about professionalism, but don't really want to put in the effort.",

          "text": "Yeah, agreed with some specifications: the industry of Agile Transformation is slowing down (call it dead if you want to, idc) but Agile as an approach is becoming the current standard- hear me out:\n\nBefore Agile, software delivery was molded after manufacturing projects of the time, where start to delivery was 2-3 YEARS. Big huge investigative plan, ruminating internally to identify ALL the details, the pitfalls, exactly when who would be doing what. THEN execute the plan for 2-3 years and SEE if you could sell the product or if your users liked the new version (think Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000... bulk build, release). \n\nNow, while there are still orgs who build software this way, most (granted limited sample size) are building much more Agile delivering multiple times a year, if not month. There is more receptivity to the ideas in the Agile Manifesto, there is more alignment with the Agile principles (regardless of if they are referenced).\n\nAgile mindset is a competitive advantage.\n\nIf you want to talk about frameworks of Agile (Scrum, Kanban, XP) sure these are not doing well (if even used correctly) and as you mentioned thousands of SM were \"paraded around\" to signal that a company was using Scum without going through the challenge that is a transformation (put makeup on a pig). I don't personally blame the Scrum Masters- they were dropped in a chaotic situation, but that is a rant for another time. But yes, there is a significant decrease in the opportunity for a \"Scrum transformation\" (maybe the same, just fewer orgs dressing up to \"play Scrum\" since it is no longer the fad).\n\nThere is still opportunity for organizational and department and team transformation- but as you made note of, it's not the ONLY accountability orgs are looking for from the SM or Agile Coach role. Some of that is moving to management, some orgs are asking for facilitation, delivery scheduler, and transformation. Just not enough appetite for it to be a full time role (and, c'mon look at the industry track record for \"transformation\")",

And many of the ones that don't are ruining the young impressionable ones who could do some good with proper development.\n\nMyself and my current SM came to our current team from a team that wasn't on an ART, so we had some creative liberties. I developed some processes to automate a lot of the manual labor agile teams in our old department were doing in Jira. Myself and my Scrum Master presented those things to the RTE and Portfolio Manager (the SM's boss) on our current train. They shot them down for no reason. The next week my SM told me his boss said he was \"spending too much time with me\".\n\nI have a PO that I work hand in hand with (same boss) who is equally creative and even more experienced than me. We're super vocal in things like Inspect & Adapt, with other teams saying they appreciate what we bring, even attempting to adopt our practices.....The RTE has referred to the two of us and our boss as \"a contagion\".\n\nThe RTE and Portfolio Manager have been meeting with the two of us every month for several months now. It feels like they're trying to silence us and keep us from spreading our ideas. (Because evidently new ideas are bad.). They try to convince us the ART is doing things \"the right away\"....That being said, their knowledge and experience can't hold a candle to either one of us, let alone both of us at the same time. We absolutely thrash both of them every time we meet.\n\nI think there's are some really good people trying to make the climb that could do great things if they got to the senior level. But I'm not sure if this framework will even salvageable by time they get there.",

Most \"agile training\" focusses on processes and tools, rather than the core leadership and (Extreme Programming / DevOps) skills needed\n\n\\- **there's a huge \"legacy codebase\"**; legacy in the Michael Feathers sense that we cannot make changes cheaply, easily, quickly and safely (no new defects) because of a combination of over-complexity, poor design and ineffective test automation.  \n\n\\- **the cloud is expensive***;*  agile practices are based on \"run it and see, then refactor\";  when you are on-prem with low cost hardware (or hardware that has been capitilised) that's one thing.  When you are running on a cloud where every byte and cycle costs, that's something else.  We used \"measure twice, cut once\" back in the mainframe days as well. \n\nAgility has much in common with \"lean\", and \"lean\" initiatives also tended to fail where it wasn't seen to be an exercise in continuously evolving the organisation towards better and better performance, over the long term.  \n  \nVery, few people in management roles are interested in the long term;  quick-wins to bolster the resume so they can move on in 3-5 years - or gain some short term bonus - tends to be the norm.",

Requirements gathering, rapid iteration, feedback loops, etc. become critical in this kind of world. Out of vogue practices like RAD and XP have things and ideas we can use to build a new model, and we'll probably need to invent whole new ways of constructing software. Non-developers who feed requirements are going to have to do things very differently to keep up.

Then, when someone goes to add clouds, they discuss it more, and realize that clouds are a stupid application of resources.\n\nThe key is that people will chase that which gets the biggest reward. Jira seems to be a good way to do this, but I personally think it is a terrible terrible terrible way to directly manage a project. All it does is set in stone, those \"let's add cloud\" issues; but now you have that accountability; but wasted accountability.\n\nThe problem is that accountability has now entirely replaced any autonomy. Jira is \"let's work together as a team as long as you obey your manager.\"\n\nThe developers then become jira ticket closing fools.\n\nKanban is somewhat better, and can work with Jira, but an Eisenhower matrix is the ideal. It technically can be combined with Jira; and that way you can see if people are closing the most urgent and important tickets, this way \"bug which is really annoying key client\" gets priority over \"let's add pretty clouds.\"\n\nOnce you replace autonomy with accountability, you, as a horrific micromanager, need to have the ability to make all the decisions, as once micromanagement kicks in, your team will mentally check out. You will have thrown out a massive amount of their ability to self regulate.\n\nThis is the difference between leadership and mangement. Management is always micromanagement. It only works when there is a process, like a factory; you need to make sure the hoppers are topped up, the machines are oiled, the forklift safety classes are passed.\n\nLeadership, is where you oversee a group of creative smart, driven people, and help them toward realizing a vision.\n\nThe moment a person says, \"Herding cats\" you have a micromanaging fool. A leader holds out a treat, the cats follow, as long as the leader isn't trying to get the cats to go somewhere stupid; as they are smart enough to not go there.\n\nBut, jira tickets can be, \"Sleep in the middle of a superhighway\" and some poor schlub will try to close that ticket.",

They will be told, clouds, oceans, and tables (rows cols).\n\nSo, they don't entirely know which one to prioritize. Except the big picture is that it is going to be accounting software used by accountants. Now they know how to prioritize.\n\nThe simple reality is that most managers got there through the peter principle. Thus, are the least equipped to make decisions; yet proceed to take away all the information and authority from those best equipped.\n\nThe simple failing of most managers is the understanding that you can't delegate responsibility, without also delegating authority.

Developers defensive start sandbagging, pointing stories higher and higher, to reduce change of carryover and to stay above point quota.\n\n2. Developers start demanding PO’s and stakeholders extensively document requirements, so no last minute edge cases or tweaks hold up the system. Developers try to get as much in writing as possible, which can be used against PO’s and stakeholders later on if they say a piece of work doesn’t meet agile’s Definition of Done and the developer’s sprint is getting threatened.\n\n\n\nThis sometimes cause civil War on the team as the PO‘s and scrum master and stakeholders start, pulling out their copy of agile manifesto and start citing it, and claiming that they don’t have to provide all the details and requirements, because agile. And the PO and stakeholders start comparing working with developers to using a monkey’s paw.\n\n3. Malicious compliance on developers’ part tends to go up.\n\n4. Nobody wants to write tests, especially if the tests are retroactively for code that was written much earlier before the codebase ever had tests.\n\n5. Developers end up jockeying for the easy plum stories that have a little risk; they will actively avoid complex stories that potentially require lots of innovation, as the risk of sprint carryover can be pretty high for those. The people who tend to end up getting the complex or innovative stories tend to get pipped more as they have more sprint carryovers.\n\n6. PO’s, managers, and stakeholders end up being present in planning poker meetings and try to negotiate down the number of story points devs assign to stories. In some cases the PO, manager, stakeholder etc will not like the final points and ask the developers to repoint all the stories again until they get story pointings they like. This is usually done to extract more work out of developers at the expense of their work life balance; as well as gaslight developers who say the amount of work scheduled for the sprint isn’t possible.\n\nIf there is then sprint carryover even after points are negotiated down and devs miss kids’ birthday parties and funerals, management can them come back with “the number of points was average for our sprint; what happened guys?”",

If the same thing keeps happening week after a week after a week sprint after sprint, this should be documented and buy about the third sprint when the same shit rolls around you forced them to deal with it. Yes I said force. People don’t always like fixing things when it’s hard. But if they don’t fix things, they never get better. That’s called leadership.\n\nIf they don’t like this approach next retrospective said there like a bump on a log. When they ask, why are you sitting there, explain to them the situation you want to make things better you’ve documented things that are not going well and no one else wants to.

Hang all complaints and grievances that surfaced in previous phases into the frame.  \n  \nNow comes the interesting twist: Explain that if they want anything in the outside frame to change, they will have to do something themselves to affect that change. Ask the team to come up with actions they can do. Put these actions into the inner rectangle (near the outer sticky they are addressing).\n\nYou can probably find other exercises to try over at retromat, too.

Understanding could come from \"motivated professionalism\" (a true professional is never satisfied and always looking for what to improve, but this is a rare species these days) or from understanding how exactly the continuous improvement is required and unavoidable.\n\nIf people aren't under external pressure where continuous improvement is required by metrics or as a part of process compliance (think of ISO 27000 or ITIL 4) then retros easily become useless time-wasting. If people don't want themselves and aren't required externally to improve, then why would they really be engaged in retros?",

Pointless and dumb.  Talk about the issue at the time, and if you agree to park it until the retro, add it to your retro board as a reminder.  \n\nUSE A WHITE BOARD - every single retro tool I have seen falls into the same trap of being \"snapshot\" focussed;  an enduring whiteboard (real or virtual) lets you track your progress, detail your working agreements, and provides a focal point for framing the start of the retrospective\n\nPOSITIVE FRAMING - always express things in terms of \"what could go better\", in a good-faith way.  There's some solid psychology and neuroscience around why this will tend to drive the team towards finding creative solutions rather than falling into the \"victim, villain, hero\" drama triangle and blame game\n\nDON'T RACE TO SOLUTIONS- it's much better to use the retro time to really dig down and get to a solid \"problem statement\" than it is to try and use the short time you have to \"solve\" things;  it's okay to set things up for a later workshop using \"Ishikawa Fishbone\", \"Evaporating Clouds\" or a bit of a \"systems thinking archetype\" approach to addressing an issue. \n\nMEASURE STUFF - when you agree to a change how you work, remember it's an experiment.  Change without data to support the value of that change is just dogma.  What are you measuring, and for how long?  And remember Goodhart's Law - you are using data to confirm improvements, not to set targets.",

          "text": ">  Has anyone found a way to make these more grounded in reality? \n\nHere are some tips that could help\n\n1) BRING THE DATA\n\nYou should start the retro looking at objective data that measured what happened during your iteration or sprint. What did you commit to? What did you ship? Did you achieve your goal or goals? Bring the core data you as a team use to measure your success as a team.\n\nIf you don't have this data then start by discussing how you do want to measure success and what metrics you will use to do so.\n\n2) FOCUS ON OUTCOME\n\nThe point of the retro should be to change something. Rants about what went wrong are not very productive unless you are going to make some change to the process that improves it. That is why a lot of frameworks for prompting conversations are focused around things like 'Things to keep vs things to change'.\n\nTry and get the team to frame their discussion items in terms of not what went wrong but what you are going to do different next iteration. If this becomes difficult or people still fall into rant mode, make this very explicate, the prompt for discussion should be what should we do differently next iteration and why.\n\n3) TAKE SMALL BITES\n\nIt can be tempting in a retro to try and boil the ocean. Everyone dumps a million complaints and then it can feel like big sweeping change is needed. Oh my god look at everything that is going wrong. You create a ton of follow up tasks and then nothing gets done.\n\nInstead, focus on the most serious issue from the previous iteration and implement one change that should improve it in the next iteration.\n\nIf people worry that you are losing all the valuable rants from the retro assure them not to worry, if a problem is really a problem _it will come up again_ over and over and that will be a signal to fix it in a future retro.\n\nWhat can work well is that everyone writes down an issue on a sticky and then you all vote, and you tackle only the issue with the highest votes as it indicates that is affecting the most people.\n\n4) MEASURE SUCCESS\n\nFrame the change you are going to make not simply as something new the team will do but also frame it as what you _expect_ to be different when you do it. Then measure that and bring that data into the next retro. You changed how you communicate that a Pull Request is waiting to be reviewed, did you see faster PR approval? No? So that seems like it is still a pressing concern that you should tackle, rather than just move on to the next issue.\n\nHope this helps.",

It is also helping them with keeping their deliveries on track.

There isn't a 'dev' component or 'QA' component, but the perspectives of the people in those roles are indeed important. Something that may take an hour for a developer to complete could take days of testing effort and vice versa. You should also consider other roles such as documentation, operations, etc.\n\n2. I used story points from 2002 until the early 2010s. We eventually realized that they really didn't provide any value over just counting completed stories. If you graphed cumulative completed story points over time and cumulative completed story count over time, the lines will be almost identical. Even when the stories aren't as small as they could be this still works, based on the data I pulled from Jira for several teams I worked with.\n\nYou mentioned SAFe and I have a comment about it specifically with respect to story points. SAFe's use of them with the \"8 points per developer per sprint\" idea is complete 🐂💩. I know the two guys who originated story points and that is absolutely NOT what they intended. Also, one of those guys, Ron Jeffries, wrote a while back that he's sorry he was involved with creating the idea of story points and suggests that people don't use them.\n\nIf you need something to forecast when work will be done, I would suggest looking into Troy Magennis' work and his forecasting spreadsheets at [https://www.focusedobjective.com/pages/free-spreadsheets-and-tools](https://www.focusedobjective.com/pages/free-spreadsheets-and-tools) .",

Either some piece of work will take less than, the same, or more SP than others. \n\nI'm about to start a new gig in a few weeks where they are using SAFe, which I have had no exposure to.

      "text": "I've recently started work in a multidisciplinary investigative team that adopted Scrum a few years ago. Think analysts, financial, tactical, (digital) forensics, OSINT, etc., all working on the same investigations. We run 4-week sprints, do sprint planning/review/retro, and track everything on a Kanban board.\n\nComing from a software/engineering background, I’m increasingly struggling with how planning is done for investigative and technical work. What I’m slowly realizing is that the core problem isn’t Scrum or Kanban (or Scrum vs Kanban for that matter), but what my team thinks a ticket should represent.\n\nRight now, a ticket is treated as “a set of known steps that can be planned up front”. That works fine for administrative or coordination work (prepare a meeting → make slides → book room → send invite). Because that’s how most of the team works, the same level of detail is expected from technical and forensic work during sprint planning.\n\nSo engineering tickets get forcibly worded and broken down into tangible, step-like todos to make them understandable and plannable up front.\n\nThe issue is that investigative/engineering work just doesn’t behave that way. Or at least that is what I think. When I get a forensic image, I don’t know yet if it’s usable, whether it’s a RAID, a VM host, corrupted, unsupported, or irrelevant. The work is mostly figuring out *what the work even is*. Planning detailed todos like “copy image”, “generate report”, “analyze report” creates a false sense of predictability and usually has to be rewritten anyway.\n\nWhat makes this really visible is what happens later. Toward the end of a sprint — or after working on the same ambiguous ticket for two or more sprints — it often becomes clear that different people had very different expectations of what that ticket actually entailed at the time of planning. The ticket looked concrete on the board, but the shared understanding wasn’t there. That is something I would really like to get the team aligned on again.\n\nCurious how others have dealt with this, especially in law enforcement, forensics, or other exploratory knowledge-work environments.",

          "text": "What you are describing is not a failure of investigative work.\nIt is a failure to distinguish refinement work from increment work, and a system that is uncomfortable with uncertainty.\n\nScrum is a social technology for empirical control in complex work. It does not assume the work is knowable up front. Kanban, used alongside it, is an observability pattern. Its purpose is to make the state of work, its age, and its flow visible, not to provide comfort through false precision.\n\nRight now, tickets are being treated as if they must represent a sequence of known steps. That forces discovery to pretend it is delivery. The board looks clear, but the understanding is not.\n\nA key distinction is being missed:\n\n- Refinement work changes the Product Backlog.\nIt reduces uncertainty, clarifies intent, surfaces constraints, and determines what might be worth doing next.\n\n- Sprint work changes the Increment.\nIt produces something usable and inspectable that advances the product or investigation.\n\n\nWhen refinement is treated as if it should behave like increment work, teams manufacture certainty early and then pay for it later in misalignment and rework.\n\nIn investigative and forensic contexts, it is entirely normal, and often correct, for the majority of a Sprint to be spent in refinement. If the primary constraint is lack of understanding, then reducing that uncertainty is the highest-value work available. Scrum does not optimise for output per Sprint; it optimises for learning and control.\n\nThe only requirement is that refinement is intentional, time-bounded, and minimal but sufficient. Open-ended analysis is not the goal, but neither is pretending the work is understood when it is not.\n\nKanban should make this visible. If refinement dominates, that is a signal about the nature of the work, not a problem to be hidden.\n\nTrying to force increment-style delivery before understanding exists does not increase predictability. It just creates fiction.\n\nIf you want to chat about it you hit me up for a diagnostic conversation on [Hinshelwood.com](Https://Hinshelwood.com)",

              "text": "Agreed. \n\nI'd suggest that perhaps to fit in with the current system that each of these tickets be broken in 2-4 tickets - one to analyse, unserstand and prioritise the nature of the work, and then other fuzzy tickets to actually do the work (depending on what it is) - obviously these would be vague, uncertain and have a planning estimate that is a range, but at least this would give visibility that there is work, as yet unknown, that is unknowable without the initial work, and there is initial work to be done to even give definition to the whole ticket's work. (Note ticket -> multiple backlog items, due to uncertainty all work cannot be known at start of sprint)\n\nAs u/mrhinsh says \"Kanban should make this visible. If refinement dominates, that is a signal about the nature of the work, not a problem to be hidden.\" Basically, make the work that you need to do and the nature of that work visible. \n\nI've seen Scrum perfectionists that insist that only the (initial) analysis be planned into a sprint as that is the only estimable work, but then have managers insist that the unknown work needs to be planned for the current sprint as it cannot wait for the next sprint - in that case, just became evident that Strict Scrum with planned sprints was not appropriate for the work in question.

Value exists only potentially in the outcome that emerges from a combination of activities that results in something usable or inspectable. When work is split into “analysis” and then “delivery”, you create hand-offs, false completion points, and the familiar “analysis is done, my part is finished” behaviour. That weakens empiricism rather than strengthening it.\n\nI do agree with the underlying intent of your comment: the nature of the work and its uncertainty must be visible. Where I disagree is how that visibility is achieved.\n\nThe focus of Scrum, or any empirical approach, is potential value delivery and learning, not accounting for individual actions. Visibility comes from making uncertainty explicit, not from decomposing it into artificially precise steps.\n\nUrgency does not turn uncertainty into commitment; it just increases the cost of pretending it is understood.\n\nOn the “Scrum perfectionists” point, this usually is not Scrum at all. It is a Dunning–Kruger effect: people who understand the mechanics but not the theory. Scrum does not require that everything anyone does is represented as a backlog item. That assumption is simply false.\n\nIn Scrum, only work that is intended to change the Increment must be represented in the Sprint Backlog. There is always significant refinement work that happens before an item is ready to be selected. That work produces learning, clarity, and Product Backlog changes, not increments. It does not need to be planned into the Sprint Backlog to be legitimate or valuable, but it does need to be done deliberately.\n\nTrying to force refinement into “planned sprint work” is exactly how teams end up pretending uncertainty does not exist. Making uncertainty visible is correct. Turning learning into activity tickets is not.",

That’s where things get fuzzy for us. Most often the “increment” isn’t a tangible artifact, but increased understanding, i.e. ruling something out, learning that a path won’t work, or providing input for a next decision. That kind of value is real, but this abstraction doesn’t map cleanly to the notion of “done”.\n\nThat mismatch is what I’m trying to get my head around.",

While our unit & integration tests test one thing at a time, our browser tests test a whole flow start to finish. I believe this is where the problem lies: Long flow tests are brittle, slow, give no information when they fail and therefore difficult to fix, and in the case of OP, difficult to configure with flags.\n\n  \nIf you had atomic browser tests (testing one user action, or only a few user actions at a time), a lot of the pain goes away, including the feature flag problem: If a specific action is related to a flag, you have now two tests: one doing the action with the flag and one without it. The rest of the flags don't matter since they're not part of the atomic action. In this way the tests actually help by documenting the active flags and how they affect the system. When a flag is removed and a choice is made, one of those tests would fail, providing proof that the removal of the flag also removed the now-defunct behavior.",

They are incredibly slow (compared to other tests), hard to maintain and they break easily.\n\nTherefore it is fair to ask \"what are we really testing here?\".  Or \"what value does it add to test this via the browser?\"   \nThere can be valid reasons to do it, but we should ask those questions.\n\nIf we are testing that a button triggers the right function, we don't need an automated test to confirm that 20 times a day.\n\nIf we are testing a flow, we may be able to test that one level deeper where we decouple the test from the page-layout.\n\nMany people treat automation like it is automating the steps that a manual tester would do. A manual tester runs everything once and while he's doing his flow, he also tests every screen and every button - especially because it's so time-consuming.  \nAn automated test does not need that.\n\nI've seen someone manually test a function by setting up data and using the browser to go through the flow. Took 1.5 days to do it once.  But the function could (and should) have been tested on the unit-level. Writing the unittest took 1.5 hours and it runs in 0.1 seconds.",

      "text": "Over the past two weeks, I’ve been reflecting on why our Scrum process feels broken, and I want to share our current situation to get an outside perspective. Officially, we use Agile Scrum, and on paper the process looks reasonable. User stories appear to be sprint-sized, and we still run sprint planning and other ceremonies. However, the way management interprets and enforces the process fundamentally contradicts how Scrum is supposed to work.\n\nOne major issue is how user stories are treated during delivery. Management does not accept that a user story should be completed collectively by the whole Scrum team within a sprint. Instead, stories are evaluated and approved based on individual man-days. Effort is calculated per person, not as a team commitment. This turns user stories into time-accounting units rather than sprint-level goals, and it removes the idea of shared ownership and collaboration.\n\nAt a higher level, epics are still considered the entire project, while milestones are treated as phase-based breakdowns, similar to waterfall. Each milestone contains only a few user stories, but those stories bundle many features and dependencies. Although these stories look like sprint-sized items, they actually represent a large amount of work spread across multiple people and a long duration, justified through man-day calculations rather than sprint capacity.\n\nSprint planning becomes mostly ceremonial. The scope and effort expectations are effectively decided upfront through man-day assumptions, leaving little room for the team to challenge feasibility or break work down meaningfully. No one really speaks up during planning, not because the issues aren’t obvious, but because the delivery model is already fixed outside the Scrum framework. Planning becomes alignment with pre-approved numbers instead of a collaborative discussion about what can realistically be delivered in one sprint.\n\nThe Product Owner role is also heavily constrained. The PO is not fully allowed to write or refine user stories independently. Acceptance criteria and Definition of Done are decided centrally (mainly by the unit head), which turns user stories into rigid contracts instead of flexible, value-driven items. This prevents proper backlog refinement and removes the PO’s ability to negotiate scope or adapt stories based on feedback and sprint learnings.\n\nOrganizationally, there is a strong control dynamic. The section head prefers to centralize decisions and processes, which limits the unit head’s autonomy and ability to support the team properly. As a result, the unit head enforces rigid and often unrealistic business processes that don’t actually help delivery. This creates a lack of trust in the team’s ability to self-organize and deliver outcomes, reinforcing the reliance on man-day calculations instead of empirical progress.\n\nOverall, the core problem is not that our user stories are obviously too big on paper, but that Scrum is being overlaid on top of a waterfall, control-driven mindset. User stories are treated as individual cost units, not as sprint-level team commitments. Leadership does not appear to trust the team to deliver collectively, and key roles are not allowed to function as intended. Because of this, the process looks Agile on the surface, but behaves very differently in practice.\n\nI’m sharing this to understand whether others have experienced similar “Agile in name only” setups, and how they’ve handled working within—or escaping—this kind of system.\n",

Broadly speaking, some types of businesses (and some cultures) have a certain way of doing things that make it harder to actually adopt agile.

That makes estimation easier and aligns well with capacity of each team member. Are you also considering risks and dependencies in your estimation process? Just be sure your point scale makes sense. A 1 and a 2 point story should be equivalent to a single 3 point story.  Similarly, a 3 and a 5 point story should be equivalent to a single 8 point story. Try having the PO establish objectives instead of defining user stories - like, \"complete development of X\" or \"Y deployment complete\".

Management can hardly have understood Scrum and still signed off on its usage.\n* To me, there feels like are a few ways you could find yourself in this situation:\n   * Scrum was a grass roots movement\n   * Significant portions of management are not communicating with each other. Someone launched Scrum without getting buy in from the rest of the management tier.\n* If you have an agile coach or champion, they either do not know their job, or they do and they've realized this is a boondoggle and are simply cashing their checks.\n* My recommendation:\n   * For the sake of the people in the teams, stop doing Scrum.\n   * Have a \"come to Jesus\" meeting. Review why Scrum is even being attempted. Are those goals reasonable and achievable?\n   * Explain the obvious conflicts between the intent of Scrum and the current environment.\n   * Either get some buy in for an actual Scrum trial or discard Scrum altogether.\n   * If you don't have a champion for Scrum that can talk to management, get one.\n\nScrum is probably the most demanding agile method, when it comes to up front organizational change. Management likely made the assumption that the change was for the line workers, not for them. If management has no intention of changing, then Scrum is doomed and you're just wasting time, money, and sanity.",
