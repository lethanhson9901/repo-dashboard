      "text": "Scaled Agile (SAFe) refuses to provide digital certifications to anybody who passed their exam after the experation date. It doesn't matter if you paid and worked for the certificate they will keep it hidden behind a paywall.\n\nI realized my documents had been missing a certification, the SAFe SM Certification 5.1. I looked everywhere on the site could not find any download links. I did see a renewal for version 6 and was not interested in being ropped out of another 300$ dollars and time.\n\nSo then I reached out to support. The level 1 personnel told me he could also not access the .pdf and I had to renew to have access to an old, expired, certifications I had earned. I explained I was not interested in the new material and simply wanted what I paid for. I had to insist on escalation to somebody who did have the authority. According to current law and buisness this was bad practice. \n\nWorth inquiring with the \\[BBB.org\\](https://www.bbb.org/us/co/boulder/profile/business-development/scaled-agile-inc-1296-1000123264) right? They are already UNTRUSTED with a C- as of early 2026.\n\nLevel 2 also tried to explain to me that the system was locked up behind the renewal paywall and they also could not provide the old certification. I asked them if they practiced Agile at their offices or that was in the title only.\n\nAfter finding them on Google maps. I found I was not the only person with bad support issues. Some other people reviews include \"Waterfall dressed as a clown.\". \n\nGiving everybody a heads up.",

Once I removed it from my resume, I got callbacks. \n\nIt's a shame, as I remember when SAFe was announced before it even needed an x.0, and the initial product was pretty good, lightweight, suitable for knitting dependencies together among apps  Exactly what was needed for decoupled web app development. \n\nMy over-a-decade old Scrum Alliance certs, obtained when they actually meant something, are the next ones I won't renew",

Anyone willing to sit on a bug for 3 months has either already churned, or it’s not really important to solve because the workaround is easy.\n\nThe remainder - what are you measuring their impact against? That’s the real question to have a good answer for before you start. If it’s conversion, rank them in severity of how they impact that. If it’s revenue retention, speak to Account Managers to figure out the churn risk of customers.\n\nI don’t recommend getting too granular. High/Med/Low impact should be enough of a prioritisation. If you find too many in one bucket, you should recalibrate your thresholds. Generally, I’d keep it 10% high, 30% medium and 60% low. Those might feel like arbitrary buckets but you cannot have 100 high impact bugs, you need to keep recalibrating your scale until only the most severe issues are considered “high”.",

Perhaps it's my background in regulated industries, but failure to report a known issue with a system would be a pretty serious non-compliance with regulations or contracts.\n\nHowever, they aren't wrong in that the first step should be a rapid cleanup of the known issues.\n\nAnything that doesn't have enough information to let someone knowledgeable in the system attempt to reproduce it can be closed. If there aren't good preconditions and reproduction steps, there's no need to waste anyone else's time. Without this information, not only will it be hard to reproduce in a development environment, but confirming the fix will also be difficult.\n\nAs a parallel activity, consider setting standards for new issues. Make sure that anything that is newly reported has enough information to reproduce, fix, and verify the solution. Don't accept defect reports that don't have the necessary information.\n\nYou also have another opportunity to close issues quickly. If the feature the defect was reported against no longer exists, you can close it. Features are deprecated all the time, and one problem I've seen is that when a feature is deprecated, the backlog work associated with it isn't cleaned up. Not only can reported defects be closed, but any ideas for enhancements or tech debt paydown can also be closed, since they're now irrelevant.\n\nInstead of categorizing by impact and priority, I'd start with something more objective. Can you check that each defect is associated with one or more features or architectural elements of the system? If so, do that. Then, you can prioritize defect repair with planned feature development. If you have planned work associated with a given feature, pull defects associated with that feature at the same time. Use this time to conduct a deeper analysis, close irrelevant defects, and fix those that need to be fixed. This also gives you a prioritization method, especially if you know the value of or risks associated with a particular feature. Instead of categorizing each defect, you cluster and improve an aspect of the system.",

That way, if you make a determination that a bug isn’t worth spending time on, you can reject it now, and get it off your open backlog. \n\nThe big advantage of this approach is for later trend analysis. Right now, it might seem like that bug isn’t worth fixing — and maybe that’s the right decision! But if it turns out that you’re getting a steady trickle of reports of what amounts to the same bug, then maybe this “minor” issue is more significant than it seemed at first, and it’s worth working on after all. \n\nDeleting the bug reports is bad, because it discards this information and makes later analysis difficult or impossible. \n\nSo my approach is fairly simple — review the bugs, reject the ones that don’t seem worth working on any time soon, and focus on the remaining high-priority issues. Later though, as new reports come in, compare them to the existing closed & rejected bugs in the archive to see if they could be a match for anything that has come up before, and if so, cross-reference the reports so that you can start building up a list of instances of the same problem, as this can inform future decisions about whether or not that bug is worth reprioritizing.",

Create focused Sprints where you can have an outcome from a user workflow perspective.  Don't work tactically.\n\n\\- identify code that can't be saved;  you might need to kill off complex, low use functionality that doesn't \"wash it's face\" in terms of value created Vs defects raised;  solve the users problem a better way and replace it entirely\n\n\\- do a deeper analysis on likely root causes, cluster, and identify with the team how where that specific defect should have been trapped \"upstream\" of the user and any manual tests as part of getting into the defect prevention business\n\n\\- improve",

And they all talk, so if someone finds a bug and someone says they wrote it up 6 months ago and it was removed, it won't get reported again.\n\n\nThird, are you required to fully prioritize this backlog? Because it is impossible to order 400 bugs. At best you can put them into a few categories.\n\n\nFinally, the only real metric is importance. And how your project determines that will be somewhat unique for your project. Bugs that completely prevent a feature from working are probably high on the list. But maybe there are features no one really uses. Or maybe there's a feature one person uses, but they're a VIP.\n\n\nI would start with just categorizing as critical or not. Until you've finished the critical ones, there's no point in putting any thought into the rest. Once the criticals are resolved you can lower the importance bar and do another batch of most important. I would generally aim for about 2 sprints worth of the most important bugs actually being ordered.\n\n\nYour two metrics of impact and priority kind of sound like the same thing. Wouldn't high impact = high priority and low impact = low priority? My team uses what's called a RICE score; reach, impact, confidence, effort; because we are required to, but it really isn't that complicated to review a bug and determine how important it is.",

I based the priority off of what the projected impact would be, should a defect make it to prod. Most priority 1 test cases were in the loan configuration module, and each module also had 1 or 2 high priority TC. I say all this because, I heavily researched the bugs that had been historically reported up until current. I exported them and filtered to see which ones were fixed, which ones were considered super severe and went in a hot fix, etc. \n\nYou could also ask customer service which areas of the software tend to always be buggy. \n\nHope some of this is helpful. \n\nJust make sure whatever you use to represent Defcon Level 1 importance, is limited to truly what stops business.",

This should be a continual process and when you have discovered a bug, change your template so that the person filling out the template can input that information for you.

How much does it block their work? That usually gets you to a high/medium/low rating faster than elaborate scoring systems. High impact = lots of users or completely blocks a key workflow. Medium = affects some users or creates workarounds. Low = edge cases or minor annoyances.\n\nFor priority, you're essentially deciding \"when should we fix this\" - next sprint, soon, or later. The combination usually shakes out naturally: high impact bugs that are quick wins go in the next sprint, high impact complex problems get scheduled, and low impact items stay in the backlog until you have cycles.\n\nOne approach that works well for big backlogs: start with a quick filtering pass. Anything that hasn't been reported again in your typical release cycle might not need immediate attention. You could also sort by how often the bug appears in support tickets or user reports - bugs that keep surfacing probably deserve prioritization even if they initially seemed minor.\n\nWith 400+ bugs, consider doing a first pass just bucketing things into critical/high/medium/low/obsolete, then spend your detailed triage time on the critical and high buckets. You'll get through the list much faster and make better decisions about what actually needs attention in your next sprint.",

How has what you, and those working with you, have accomplished moved the strategic needle?  Why would an executive, who is concerned about tradeoffs, revenue, cost savings, etc., look at your accomplishments and think that you've done more than make things really efficient?

Companies need good people that can keep things running smoothly.  Why would they want you to do something else?\n\nYou've expressed that you're frustrated that you're not getting recognized for your contributions.  Whose job have you made easier?  The Product Manager's and the project team's, or the CEO's?  All three are possible, but to borrow from u/chiggy1223:\n\n* Has it created new markets or protected its old markets better?\n* Is it tangibly raising profit margins or supercharging growth?\n\nWhich strategic objectives have you met?  Did the company have a top-level goal to deliver faster or deliver more projects?  What strategic initiatives would not have been able to be completed, let alone started, if not for the changes you helped bring about?  Nobody else is going to frame your successes in terms of strategic value for you.

Which I have done.\n\nThis isn’t just operations , it’s been a total shift in mindset across all stakeholders.",

If that's the case, then accept that the sprint is not locked-in once started, and be sure that the team and stakeholders understand how abrupt change messes with productivity.\n\nMy recent experience has had me processing a lot of my own negativite feelings because my teammates have not be following MY expectations for the team's process eg. bringing in surprise tickets mid-sprint, being pulled away from planned tickets to support another team, etc. I'm now realizing that the team has never truly bought-in-to such strict ticket/scope management, nor does team leadership expect that. So if I am unhappy, it's because my expecations don't match reality.\n\nI have been on teams (at a different company) where sprint scope WAS treated as sacred, with technical leadership being on the same page and supporting the plan. To make that work you do need the general culture who is willing to \"play within the rules\" - which is easier said than done.",

Sprint Planning is optimising for a reality that does not exist, so the plan predictably collapses. Until planning reflects the actual operating conditions, the ceremony will continue to look serious while producing no signal worth trusting.\n\nThe Sprint Goal already covers this. It is the only commitment in the Sprint. Make the Sprint Goal smaller, then create a concrete implementation plan for the first 24 hours only, and adapt it each day.\n\nThat rolling 24-hour plan can change at any time as new information arrives. The Sprint Goal remains achievable because it represents a small, intentional subset of the Sprint. You deliberately leave slack in capacity for the known unknowns. If you get most of the way through the Sprint, you can always pull more work from the Product Backlog.\n\nThis is how Scrum is intentionally designed to adapt; we learn more by doing.",

That framing already assumes the wrong problem.\n\nIn Scrum, prioritisation is an **accountability**, not a voting exercise and not a power grab.\n\nPolitically, it maps closest to **technocracy with delegated authority**: decisions are made by the person accountable for outcomes, informed by evidence and expertise, and constrained by transparency, not popularity.\n\nThe Product Owner is accountable for maximising value. That means:\n\n* synthesising customer evidence, market signals, risk, and constraints\n* making trade-offs explicit\n* ordering work based on outcomes, not volume or loudness\n\nTeams don't vote on priorities because accountability without decision authority is meaningless. But equally, good Product Owners don't operate in isolation. They rely on:\n\n* Developers to surface technical risk and feasibility\n* Stakeholders to provide context and demand signals\n* Evidence from real usage to invalidate assumptions\n\nWhen prioritisation feels authoritarian, it's usually because strategy is unclear, feedback loops are weak, or the backlog is treated as a demand intake queue instead of a hypothesis list.\n\nWhen it feels like democracy, it's often because no one is actually accountable for outcomes.\n\nThe healthy pattern is neither.\n**Accountable technocracy under transparent constraint.**\n\nIf prioritisation can't be explained in terms of value and learning, it's broken, regardless of who made the call.",

You don't have to decode metaphors about anchors and winds to figure out what to work on next.\n\nI also think elaborate formats can feel a bit performative after a while - the novelty wears off and then you're stuck with something complicated that's also stale. Plus/delta just... keeps working.\n\nNot saying the other formats are bad - sailboat can be great for a change of pace - but for week-in-week-out retros, simple wins.",

Outcomes are always influenced by multiple factors. What matters is whether the **conditions for better outcomes** now exist.

These only change when the system changes.\n\n- **Lead Time for Changes (DORA)**  \n  Time from code committed to code running in production.  \n  **Why:** Reveals delivery pipeline friction, testing debt, and organisational bottlenecks that sit beyond any single team.\n\n- **Deployment Frequency (DORA)**  \n  How often the organisation successfully deploys to production.  \n  **Why:** A strong proxy for flow, technical health, and organisational trust, none of which can be improved in isolation.\n\n- **Unrealised Value (EBM)**  \n  Known opportunities that exist but are not yet delivering value.  \n  **Why:** Shows whether the organisation is learning and adapting, or simply executing what it already decided.\n\nYou can also use **Columinity** for team-level metrics that avoid measuring individuals and instead surface stability, interaction patterns, and continuity over time.\n\nIf these measures improve, it does not prove a single cause.  \nIf they do not improve, it does show the system has not changed.\n\nStay away from BS metrics like:\n\n- Velocity  \n- Utilisation  \n- Story points completed  \n- Tasks  \n- Original estimates vs actuals  \n\nThese describe activity.

That’s not how complex systems work, and it’s not how we measure any other leadership or system role.\n\nDevelopers produce features. Those features can be tied to money.\nAgile Coaches don’t produce features. They work on the conditions that allow teams to produce features reliably.\n\nAsking “how do you know it was the Agile Coach and not the team getting their shit together” misses the point. Teams don’t just magically improve inside the same constraints. When lead time drops, coordination improves, waste goes down, and delivery becomes more predictable, that only happens because something in the system changed.\n\nThat change doesn’t show up as a Jira ticket that maps to dollars. And expecting it to is a category error. We don’t ask architects, managers, finance, or legal to justify themselves in story points either.\n\nSaying “leadership only cares about numbers” also doesn’t really help the case. Numbers show outcomes, not who gets credit. No serious organisation tries to attribute revenue to a single role. They look at whether results improved after deliberate changes to how the organisation works.\n\nIf leadership is asking for a clean $$$ attribution, they’re not actually asking how to measure impact. They’re looking for justification during layoffs. No metric will satisfy that, because the decision isn’t about evidence.\n\nThe only honest question is:\nDid the system produce better outcomes after the coaching started?\n\nIf yes, the coaching mattered.\nIf no, it didn’t, or leadership refused to change.\n\nEverything else is just BS.\n\n---\n\nhttps://columinity.com/",

How can I hold the AC responsible when they aren't making the decisions that affect agility?  Again, that may not be your issue.
