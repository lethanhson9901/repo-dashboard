      "text": "Early 2023s, small fintech startup. Deadline: 4 months to launch. Engineering team was literally 3 people. Me as architect, plus two devs. We had our shit together. Architecture designed, infrastructure running in the cloud, backend skeleton ready. \n\nDevs were building features. We were on track. Then month 2 hit and management started hiring. A bunch of managers showed up. Then they brought in a Scrum Master. First week this guy wants to implement full Agile ceremonies. \n\nDaily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives, backlog refinement. The whole package. His reasoning: \"You need process to scale.\" We had 8 weeks left. \n\nWe weren't trying to scale. We were trying to finish. I've seen this same pattern play out multiple times now. Small team shipping. Management gets uncomfortable with lack of visibility, they hire process people. Process people need to justify their existence, ceremonies get implemented and everything slows down. \n\nThe thing that kills me is the timing. We were working. Why fix what isn't broken when you're 8 weeks from deadline? I'm genuinely curious, why can't management just leave working teams alone? Is it actual concern about sustainability or is it just discomfort with not having control mechanisms in place? \n\nWhat's your experience with this?",

Basically say, this is making things worse, what were you hoping to achieve, maybe we can find a way to make that happen.\n\nEssentially, the three different scenarios I've witnessed personally when it came to transitioning to agile all had different reasons.\n\n1. Some form of organization was needed. The company operated in a chaotic way for 10 years or so and got really successful, secured investment to grow even more so their headcount increase was 100% yearly. They were also really bogged down by their previous poor decisions, and were constantly firefighting because of shit code. All the new projects were started agile but the legacy team stayed fucked, once the new revenue channels outperformed the old solutions, they sunseted that product and had a unitary way of working.\n\n2. Company got bought, owners enforced their own ways of working, ended up being pretty average experience, not great, not terrible.\n\n3. CEO got conned by a consultancy firm to hire some consultants to fix something that wasn't broken. 6 months later, they broke the contract because they had no idea how to do that and it was just a massive waste of time. There were like 10 devs total, so there was no need for it, we were shipping everything on time, the product was decent.",

That's essentially what this felt like - consultancy-driven change rather than solving an actual problem. We were shipping, had clear visibility, no firefighting.\n\nThe thing that makes it tricky: when you're the one questioning the change, it's easy to get labeled as \"resistant\" rather than \"concerned about timing.\" Framing it as \"let's find a way to achieve your goals\" is much smarter than \"let's not do this now.\"\n\nOn your scenario #3 - how did you guys eventually get out of it? Did leadership recognize it wasn't working, or did the consultants just run out their contract and leave?\n\nAnd on the metrics point: we didn't have formal velocity tracking (ironically, because we weren't doing sprints yet), so proving slowdown would have been anecdotal.

                  "text": "How did we recognize it wasn't working? There were two teams that were small enough where it was easy to gauge the rate we were going at without measurements. Obviously the consultants came in and started enforcing a bunch of redundant nonsense and the story point system they implemented rather than be used for planning was being used for measuring performance, some people caught on, started overestimating, there was some poker planning where it was hard to land on an estimation because some people wanted to juke the numbers and some didn't. However, those measurements ended up doing them in, about 2 months in, our very clever team lead at the time told the scrum master that we should retroactively add value to completed work so we can have a better sample set for our estimations, they were super hyped for it, so we wasted a bunch of time doing that, and then he used those numbers to calculate our velocity pre-consultancy which was higher than after they joined. Took the numbers to the CEO, the reception was mixed, no action was taken immediately but he didn't dismiss it out of hand, basically ended up saying we'll keep an eye on it. A few months later, the numbers didn't get better and because they had already kind of established velocity as a measurement of performance, that was used as a metric to justify them doing bad work. We moved to some sort of compromise where we did measure some things, kept ceremonies to a minimum, estimations weren't done by commitee but by the leads alone, and there was an understanding that they are used for planning purposes and nothing else. I left maybe 4 months afterwards so I didn't end up seeing how it continued afterwards.\n\nThe key part here is to not wait until shit hits the fan, do your due dilligence, let your line manager know as early as possible, if you can have some way to quantify it, non-technical people love that shit, because they usually have a monetary value associated with the work you are trying to complete so they can translate that to potential losses. After that, if they dig in, wait for shit to hit the fan, that's probably the last opportunity for them to be convinced it's a bad idea. If nothing changes, jump ship, it's not the kind of management you want to work for.",

But still - it needs to match the scale of the rest of the efforts. Rather than this process, the answer might well be something like \"and hire _one_ product person to work with those managers on scope and priorities, and have the team work only with that new person.\"",

Three engineers trying to satisfy five different people simultaneously.\n\nThat's not a process problem. That's an org design problem, no amount of Scrum fixes that.

Ultimately, leadership is responsible for your output so if you don’t do a good job of giving them inputs, they will find another method, hence the Scrum Master. Scrum is a way for leadership to understand the development process in chunks so that they can make strategic decisions when needed. \n\nThe “trust me bro” approach has been tried time and time again by small development teams and it has failed more times than it has succeeded. \n\nIf you’re already feeling the pressure to deploy in 8 weeks, likely the release date is too aggressive. A good SM could and should relay that to leadership, find a way for a compromise to give the development team more bandwidth. When you rush, things break. And while the sentiment of rapid release is common and likely practiced at my small organizations, taking a tactical pause and making the tough decision to delay a release is likely the better move. \n\nAs you scale, yes you will have increased overhead. That is the cost of doing business. If you don’t want leadership poking around into what you’re doing and adding unnecessary headcount, learn their language and garner trust.",

Short feedback loops, almost no ceremony, lots of trust, and the assumption that most early decisions will be wrong and need fixing fast.\n\nThat phase is not about scaling.\nIt is about learning.\n\nXP exists for the moment when requirements are fuzzy, designs are still forming, and speed of feedback matters more than predictability.\n\nYou do not need sprints when your iteration cycle is hours.\nYou do not need backlog refinement when priorities change midweek.\nYou do not need formal standups when everyone already knows what everyone else is doing.\n\nFrom inside the team it feels efficient.\nFrom the outside it looks scary.\n\nThen management shows up and sees no charts, no velocity, no visible control points. Someone says we need process to scale.\n\nExcept you were not scaling.\nYou were trying to finish a prototype with a deadline.\n\nDropping full Scrum ceremonies into that situation does not make the team faster. It stretches the feedback loop. Work that used to flow continuously now waits for planning. Decisions that used to happen in minutes get parked until the next meeting. Momentum slowly turns into overhead.\n\nThe ironic part is that XP is not a lack of process. It is just optimized for discovery instead of reporting.\n\nScrum is great once you know what you are building and need predictability, coordination, and long term planning. XP is better when you are still figuring out what the product even is.\n\nTrying to apply delivery scale process to a discovery stage team does not create maturity. It just replaces progress with meetings.\n\nI have seen this transition work well when it happens later. Prototype fast using XP. Validate the product. Lock in the architecture. Then introduce Scrum once the work shifts from learning to delivery.\n\nBut doing it eight weeks before launch is not scaling.\nIt is hitting the brakes because leadership wants visibility.\n\nSometimes the best thing management can do is recognize that the team is already using the right process and let them keep shipping.",

I work in a very large org, massive global company. \n\nClose to 100 teams in this division. Nothing is agile. At all. It’s project management, six months at a time. Code quality is shit. Practices are 1990s era. \n\nFor me, it’s soul crushing. But what can I do? I have had more success in other companies, and less success. I try to influence people when and where I can. \n\nThey pay me a lot. Management ultimately doesn’t care. They think they are winning, because the product makes a lot of money in a niche industry. Everyone gets a huge bonus. \n\nThe code quality still sucks. Everything is slower and more painful than it needs to be. But the majority of people have never worked for any other company. We’re talking tenures for most people of at least 10 years, and many are 20, 30, 40. They think they are experts. But they’ve never seen software practiced any other way. \n\nEveryone is in a bed of shit. There’s no magic solutions. My chief recommendations to everyone are:\n\n1. Sit down together, everyone, and read the Scrum Guide line by line. Say out loud if everyone agrees with it or not, and if not, write out a replacement. At least then everyone is on the same page - literally. \n\n2. Measure things. But down drown in measurements that don’t matter. We can’t sell estimate points to customers. \n\n3. Be honest, and ask for honesty in return. What does each person really want out of the complex job situation. Safety? More money? Advancement? Improving their skills? Negotiate on what will move the needle for everyone / each person.",

          "text": "So many of the agile ceremonies are theater in a fast moving team when you just have to ship something fast. \n\nI’m on a team that just shipped a pretty substantial clean architected platform in just 90 days. We had to triage how we used our tooling essentially. We were rigid about git obviously, we used a ton of unit tests, we generated a lot of test data too, but we used jira board as little more than a sticky board to grab shit and knock it out. It’s all we could do. We had a year of work to do in 90 days, I’m not exaggerating (we were told a deadline and feature set by a client and it was do it or don’t take the contract no other option). \n\nWe build a really high quality beautiful full featured system to their specs and it just reminds me of how inefficient agile is. But basically we were a team of folks brought in, all the most technical people at the company (they had no one internal to do this) and the architect had a 3 month head start. \n\nThere were a lot of days where I was pushing 1000+ lines of code working 12-15 hour days. It was insanity and I know kloc isn’t a great metric but that’s a lot of code to pump out consistently day after day, so many features, a lot of highly technical code too on my end too while the juniors and mids on the team mostly churned out endpoints using the tools me and the architect wrote. When I wasn’t working I was thinking about the problem. When I take on a mission I’m obsessed with completing it. \n\nWe made it we shipped. Client loves it. \n\nBut here’s the thing…we had to drop almost every agile ceremony but a morning status that was overly technical at parts but brief too thinks offline constantly collaborating with each other to solve the tough problems fast. \n\nAdopting full agile ceremonies would have sunk our timeline: there’s no way we would have made it. It worked for us bc we are all highly technical, experienced folks, highly motivated, they hired the right team and they let us manage our process. \n\nWe are going to now move into more sustainable work going forward (I worked ~300 hours in January as per my timesheet). We have time now on feature enhancements and somehow we ended up shipping a well architected scalable system with really clean code all throughout. \n\nI suspect the agile ceremonies would have maybe not killed our timeline but the quality of code we would have written would have dropped tremendously. We would have been way too fatigued to get our work done as well from the nonsense meetings. \n\nAgile doesn’t have to be heavyweight to add value to what you do. We did sprintsish (it was essentially one big sprint tho), we iterated on things, we documented anything that needed documenting, etc, but we had literally no time for anything but a massive sprint to mvp and just pushing tickets through to testing. \n\nOof I’m exhausted. I would have left if upper management would have done to me what they did to you.\n\nWhen you shake up a team process you need a transition plan to move towards that slowly and figure out what helps and what hurts. /rant",

That's not sustainable and I think that's the other side of this conversation nobody wants to have.

But if that team had one person get sick or one had a family emergency the whole thing collapses.

And most importantly, what did stakeholder satisfaction look like?… Because when I hear teams say things like this, its usually because their view of things is quite narrow, I.e. inward focused as opposed to being more outward. Fair play if you were managing those things and I agree, if it is working for the team AND stakeholders are satisfied then the SM should only suggest or recommend changes, and the team gets to decide what is working for them.\n\nBut if an SM was added to the team, this suggests something wasn’t quite working for someone somewhere?

But try not to blame the SM for that, I think you already realise that this is all coming from senior management. But try to remember that they’re only trying to solve a problem that you’re not aware of at the moment.\n\nMy advice is that you should try to initiate the conversations to seek answers to your questions directly with your SM, but do so without aggression and try to be as constructive as you can; collaborate. Try to seek a mutual understanding of each other’s position/perspective and you may discover the underlying reasons for everything that’s going on. In which case, perhaps you can help them solve those problems and in doing so, I guarantee you will all have a much easier time together. Expectations will be reset and all the stress can go away (or at least be directed towards real problems anyway haha).\n\nHave the courage to seek your answers and keep an open mind!",

      "text": "Here, on the vast plains of the Q3 roadmap, a remarkable ritual is about to unfold. The engineering tribe has gathered around the glow of the digital watering hole for the ceremony known as Sprint Planning. It is here that we can observe one of the most mysterious and misunderstood creatures in the entire corporate ecosystem: the Story Point.\n\nFor decades, management scientists have mistaken this complex organism for a simple unit of time or effort. This is a grave error. The Story Point is not a number; it is a complex social signal, a display of dominance, a cry for help, or a desperate act of camouflage.\n\nAfter years of careful observation, we have classified several distinct species.\n\n**1. The Optimistic Two-Pointer (Estimatus Minimus)**\n\nA small, deceptively placid creature, often identified by its deceptively simple ticket description. Its native call is, \"Oh, that's trivial, it's just a small UI tweak.\" The Two-Pointer appears harmless, leading the tribe to believe it can be captured with minimal effort. However, it is the primary prey of the apex predator known as \"Unforeseen Complexity.\" More often than not, the Two-Pointer reveals its true, monstrous form mid-sprint, devouring the hopes of the team and leaving behind a carcass of broken promises.\n\n**2. The Defensive Eight-Pointer (Fibonacci Maximus)**\n\nThis is not an estimate; it is a territorial display. The Eight-Pointer puffs up its chest, inflates its scope, and stands as a formidable warning to any Product Manager who might attempt to introduce scope creep. Its large size is a form of threat posturing, communicating not \"this will take a long time,\" but \"do not approach this ticket with your 'quick suggestions' or you will be gored.\" It is a protective measure, evolved to defend a developer's most precious resource: their sanity.\n\n**3. The Ambiguous Five-Pointer (Puntus Medius)**\n\nThe chameleon of the estimation world. The Five-Pointer is the physical embodiment of a shrug. It is neither confidently small nor defensively large. It is a signal of pure, unadulterated uncertainty. A developer who offers a Five-Pointer is not providing an estimate; they are casting a vote for \"I have no idea, and I am afraid to commit.\" It survives by blending into the middle of the backlog, hoping to be overlooked.\n\n**4. The Mythical One-Pointer (Unicornis Simplex)**\n\nA legendary creature, whose existence is the subject of much debate among crypto-zoologists of Agile. Sightings are incredibly rare. The legend describes a task so perfectly understood, so devoid of hidden dependencies, and so utterly simple that it can be captured and completed in a single afternoon. Most senior engineers believe it to be a myth, a story told to junior developers to give them hope.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOur research indicates that the Story Point has very little to do with the actual effort required to complete a task. It is a complex language of risk, fear, and social negotiation, practiced by a tribe that is being forced to navigate a dark, unmapped territory. The entire, elaborate ritual of estimation is a coping mechanism for a fundamental lack of visibility.\n\nThey are, in essence, guessing the size of a shadow without ever being allowed to see the object casting it.\n\n\n\nThought we could use some humor to start the week (this is all tongue-in-cheek ).  If I have overstepped, please let me know and I will take this down.",

The problem is well defined and small in scope (I say problem here, not solution, a story describes your users work, not your work).\n\nIf it's \"Too Fucking Big\" then the team understands the problem to be solved but feels that the problem is too large and needs to find ways to split it into more manageable problems of smaller scope, looking for a smaller MVP. \n\nIf it's \"No Fucking Clue\" then the team has no clear understanding of the scope of the problem and some investment must be made to investigate the problem space and come up with next steps. Some testing and iteration need to occur to determine what an MVP and the next iterations should even look like.\n\nThe goal is to have every story be a 1, if it's a 1 it's ready to be worked on, if it's one of the others, work needs to happen to make it a 1 (or more accurately to define multiple 1's). The main priority is to \"right-size\" the stories and get them feeling fairly uniform, with them all focused on defining a user-facing problem to be solved.\n\nThen to measure the teams performance and make estimations of projected performance it becomes just a matter of counting how many stories are completed within a time frame, how long stories stay in different phases of work, how many stories are waiting on being done, etc",

We are TINY.\n\nMy CEO has decided we need to get on \"proper sprints.\" He wants quarterly planning, pre-grooming, grooming, daily standups, retros, AND a mid-sprint check-in. For FIVE people on my team.\n\nThe real issue is that we are crushing it right now. Like, genuinely moving faster than any team I've ever been on. I use Telos to listen to customer calls, turn those into requirements and mockups, hand them to the engineers, they throw it into Cursor, and stuff gets shipped. Constantly. There is no bottleneck. There is no communication problem. We literally just talk to each other because there's five of us.\n\nI tried to explain this. But I'm 99% sure this is about looking good for investors. \"We run proper two-week sprints with quarterly planning\" sounds better in a board meeting than \"we just build stuff really fast.\"\n\nSo now I'm looking at potentially adding like 6 hours of meetings per week to a team that is literally 5 people. For what? So we can have a retro where the same 5 people who talk every day can talk about how the sprint went?\n\nI'm not against process when you need it. I've worked at bigger companies where \"real\" Agile made sense because coordination was actually hard. But we don't have a coordination problem. We have a CEO who wants to play startup theater.\n\nHas anyone successfully pushed back on a situation like this? Please lmk if so\n\n\n\nEdit: I don't normally share tools. But I've had multiple people ask what our setup is to move so fast. Like I said, my team uses [cursor](https://cursor.com/home) development and I use [telos](https://www.telos-ai.org) for management",

Two-week sprints, quarterly planning, extra check-ins, those are governance signals, not delivery improvements.\n\nThe risk is that you replace a system that’s currently learning in real time with startup theatre. Six extra hours of meetings for five people doesn’t create better outcomes when you’re already talking continuously. It just formalises conversations you’re already having and turns learning into reporting.\n\nCeremonies only earn their keep when they solve a real problem, usually decision latency, missing context, or misalignment at scale.

That can be done without bolting a heavyweight process onto a five-person team that’s already working.\n\nPushing back doesn’t mean being anti-process. It means asking which specific problem these ceremonies are meant to solve, and what evidence you expect to see improve.\n\nThat usually comes down to visibility questions like:\n\n* Can the CEO see what’s been delivered each Sprint?\n* Can stakeholders see it?\n* Is it actually in production?\n* Is there a clear way to show how what’s being delivered ties back to the overall business objectives?\n\nIf those answers are already “yes”, more ceremonies won’t fix anything.

Take the approach that you are trying to solve his problem with a minimum impact to the team's ability to deliver.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if most of the problem is a visibility problem. Shipping faster than ever could mean he has less visibility into what is really happening, which makes it difficult for him to explain to investors how well things are going. And, shipping fast without industry standard practices makes investors who know a thing or 2 jumpy because they have seen a lot of shiny on the outside, rotten on the inside software get delivered fast that looks great right up until the rot accumulates enough that the whole thing comes crashing down. So, they are probably asking questions he can't answer, and this is his solution.\n\nOf course, the ceremonies don't really help that, but they create the illusions of control that make everyone feel better. \n\nSo, find out the real issues, and more than likely, there are common solutions that you can use to solve those while maintaining team effectiveness.

In 2000-2005 if a team is planning a weekly release, they were likely doing eXtreme Programming (XP), By 2005 Scrum was winning over XP and we saw often saw two-week intervals between planned releases. Add ten teams and some scrum teams were doing three weeks between planned releases.  Team that gravitated toward shorter release cadences would talk of Kanban more so than XP. Safe was a huge thing. More than ten years back SAFe and Less would often (not always) observe 2-week sprints within 4 to 6 week releases and be able to have 20-60 teammates subdivided across tiers/services/apps.\n\nYour boss might be used to one of those longer realities from their past, and simply want to re-implement it.

But the more I read the descriptions, the more confusing it got.\n\nSome companies describe it like a classic Scrum Master (facilitating ceremonies, removing blockers, coaching teams). Others make it sound closer to a Project Manager (timelines, stakeholder updates, delivery tracking). And a few even mix in things like value measurement and business outcomes.\n\nSo now I’m wondering what this role actually is supposed to be.\n\nOn one team I spoke with, their Delivery Lead basically handled cross-team coordination and stakeholder management while the Scrum Master focused only on team health. On another, it sounded almost identical to a PM with an Agile label. Feels like every company defines it differently.\n\nPart of me thinks this might just be title inflation. But part of me also wonders if it’s becoming a natural “next step” role as teams scale beyond just Scrum Masters and POs.\n\nCurious how it works in your org.",

The model we went through and I pushed was bottom up and middle out. We had management support but not a mandate other than \"get better at delivery.\" Funny story, one of our agile coaches, who had a corporate mindset, kept complaining, \"why doesn't management send a memo telling everyone you have to go agile, these teams are not doing what they are supposed to!\" This made me laugh because if a coach can't help a team see the value of agile methods for themselves and have THEM buy in, no amount of coercion will result in change. Human beings do what is in their best interest and agile, for most, not all, is in their best interest. An empathic coach who can help them through that process, and it takes time, will create lasting change.",

The ones responsible take ownership over all needed for it. Subtasks only get added for blockers or issues that arise that need input.\n\nWhen your team is not multi disciplinary enough transition can be done by reducing sub tasks to only those entirely necessary, but that create clear ownership of whole blocks of the process needed for delivery. For example: Dev, Test, Doc, Deliver.   \nAnd then only add tasks for specific blockers or issues that arise somewhere in the change. So do not split the Dev down to specific tasks. This is the start of waterfalling.\n\nTransition will never happen when you try and smoothen out the waterfall and just focus on better facilitating the handovers.

The key is making these templates specific enough to be useful but flexible enough that people actually use them instead of working around them.  \n  \nSecond, and this is the bigger win, they may automate the routine stuff. Instead of manual subtasks for \"run security scan\" or \"update swagger\" they build that into their CI/CD pipeline. The documentation updates and wiki changes become part of their definition of done that gets checked automatically or prompted during code review.  \n  \nThe backlog tool becomes less important when you're not manually tracking repetitive process steps. Teams get much better velocity and consistency when they focus on automating the predictable bits rather than just tracking them better.",

However, you’ll still need to solve for making the work visible at some point, and if you all aren’t located in the same office, that tool needs to be digital.\n\nPart of my checkered past is solving for work management solutions - specifically agile, scaled agile, asynchronous and autonomous team collaboration (“ride a horse 🐴, save a meeting 📆…”). I’m not selling you anything - I’m just passionate about this space). The trick is to not over-engineer and solve for every possible use case, but to start simple, cost effective, and consider scalability.\n\nCouple questions:\n1. Do you guys have a budget for tools or do we need to work with free and/or tools you already have?\n2. Do you have dependencies on other teams that track their work in different tools?\n3. If so, what tools are those?\n4. If no, would they be open to tracking their work that you’re dependent on in your solution?\n\nWe’ll start there. That will give us just enough information to pick a path.\n\nFeel free to DM but I’m happy to work with you on this. I happen to have some free time on my hands and I enjoy creating solutions that support agile teams… as well as helping fellow agile trench-mates : iron sharpens iron 😁\n\nCheers!\nMysti",

He wasn't considered part of the build-capacity.  If he found a bug was easy he'd fix it - no hassle, no extra administration, no meetings, no overhead. Just fix&done.

Also, a personal Kanban with \"to do,\" \"doing\" and \"done.\" Cards should have estimates (Fibonacci?) and due dates.  Take some time to poke fun at command and control pm systems.  😉\n\n2.  Legos!  A single, kinda big model that breaks into subassemblies well.  The kids decompose the project, sort into backlog states, and touch base a couple times to update.  Not sure what the timing is on this, probably like 10-15 minute \"sprints\" so you can have a couple. \n\n3. Individual time to lay out all their current assignments into personal Kanbans.

      "text": "My favorite metric for dev teams is average bug age (ABA), that is, [average age of ***open*** bugs](https://middleraster.github.io/ABA/TheMetricForSoftwareDevelopment.html). With a proper bug-handling policy, it's hard to drive that number down to something close to 0 (and keep it there) without lots of good things happening.\n\nRecently I've heard people assert (without proof) that all metrics are gameable, though lead and cycle times are harder to game.  That's probably true, but I recently started thinking about the mathematics of Little's Law in relation to ABA. Here are my thoughts: [Is the ABA Metric Gameable?](https://middleraster.github.io/mathmusings/ABA/IsABAGameable.html) My conclusion: I *think* it's hard or even impossible to game in a way that's not easily detectable.\n\nMy challenge/ask of you:  if you can think of a way to game the ABA metric, one that I haven't already covered in my posts, please let me know, and if we're really lucky, maybe I'll be able to think of a mitigation.\n\nP.S.:  Before we get started, ***please*** note the difference between [throughput and cycle time](https://middleraster.github.io/Kanban/KanbanThoughts.html): they are orthogonal. (I even wrote a [simulator](https://middleraster.github.io/Kanban/KanbanSimulator.html) to show the difference:  you can easily change cycle time, yet throughput stays the same).\n\n  \n\\--UPDATE--\n\nThank you for your responses. \n\n**1)** There seems to be quite a bit of misunderstanding of my ABA metric. It's the average age of the **open** bugs, For example, (not to pick on her post, but it got the most upvotes) Possible-Ebb9889 said:\n\n1. Discover a bug\n2. Don't tell anyone or put in a jira ticket\n3. Spend a week working on it\n4. Create a ticket when I'm done and checking the code in\n\nThen she claims the ABA for that bug is 0, but *that is measuring something else*, not the average age of the open bugs. \n\nIn my ABA metric, let's suppose that the average bug age of open bugs for her (or her team) was 7 days. She then works on this hidden bug for a week and checks in the fix. At this point, the ABA of the open bugs is now ***14 days:  worse than when she started.*** Not gaming anything:  time is relentless. \n\nThe open bugs age by a day per day, every day. You can't keep that number close to zero unless you can fix bugs quickly and easily, which means having code that is well-factored, simple to understand, well-architectured, with automated tests in place, etc.\n\n**2)** Other people have claimed that closing all the old bugs is \"gaming\" the metric, but I consider closing old bugs a completely appropriate action and is the standard advice for handling old bugs:  if they're really all that important, they'll come back. Again, not gaming anything. Similarly, I'm not claiming every bug has to be fixed; rather, I'm claiming every bug should be fixed immediately or closed immediately.",
