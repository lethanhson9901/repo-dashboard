It slowly morphed into it's own thing and I've completely moved out of the Agile bubble and into a.i./adjacent initiatives. I know every situation is unique, but I've been involved in organizations time and time again, where if you see a gap and fill said gap, there's a strong possibility that you wind up becoming the champion or expert in that area. People start treating you as the source or direction for what happens next. Wish me luck though, because we're beginning to go through massive layoffs across the entirety of the organization.",

A lot of the agile principles have been applied since ages, just with different lingo and slightly different contexts (off course there was no IT back in 1900)\n\n2. Scum as a framework is rather small (limited), which has it's advantages, but it does not give you any answers on many topics. For example:  \"trust\" is important in teams, like the scrum guide tells us. But it does not tell us, how to get people to trust each other in a team. So there is loads of schools and people's science out there that you could study, just on this single Scrum 'item'.\n\nSo move on beyond the \"Scrum is the new thing and a better way of doing projects\" narrative and have a look in the broader field of project management schools.

Yesterday I had a chance to speak with my CTO and ask about the recent changes.\n\nTL;DR of what he told me.\n\nThe board has very ambitious goals for the upcoming years. We’re talking 'becoming a market leader' level ambition. To achieve that, they can't rely on small, incremental growth and instead need what he called a strategic leap on multiple levels.\n\nAccording to the CTO, each such leap requires 5-10 teams working together on a single product, and the company wants to execute several of these leaps simultaneously (for context IT alone has around 2000 employees).\n\nMy boss added that, in his opinion, Scrum simply doesn’t scale in this way. A single Product Owner wouldn’t be able to handle such project, so they felt the need to introduce several new roles - product managers, area product owners, analysts, etc. Hence the idea of 'improving' the agile model in ways that move us closer to a top-down planned waterfall.\n\nI have to admit, I somewhat understand his thinking. As an IT team leader, I don’t have great experiences with scaling Scrum and the literature seems divided on the topic.\n\nI’m curious about your experiences. Have you ever worked with multiple teams on a single product? Did you have to change the organizational structure, or were you able to split the system architecture in a way that minimized dependencies? Did adding more teams actually speed things up?\n\nLet me know what practices you would repeat and which ones ended up dragging the project down.",

If you tell developers to read it, they want to gouge out there eyes (at least for me). \n\n\nPeople don't know the extent of waterfall. In the waterfall culture, I once consulted with a team as outsider to propose a feature. I described the deficiency of the existing system and proposed a solution. They spent the entire year having 3 different developers refining the proposal I made, which I can actually complete the change in 2 months at latest. Let's just assume, maybe my proposal wasn't good enough, but none of their developer is able to create a new documents that pass the bar either. So, clearly it aint my problem. I don't know they finally implemented it or not, but they spent entire year to refine the proposal document for something I can do it in 2 months myself. It is that exhausting.\n\n\nSAFe basically only needs to come up with a concept of the plan. They described the problem they want to solve. They have a UX markup if there is UX. They handed down to the scrum teams. They don't spent a while damn year trying to refine a proposed capacity.\n\n\nIt can still run into lack of explicit ACs like scrum. But typically there is quite a lot of trust on the teams to do their work without so much information on everything.",

          "text": "My current employer is similar in size R&D-wise, and we routinely have 15-20 teams working to bring several new hardware-based IoT product to market at the same time, but in different phases of development. The teams follows the architecture, rather than use-cases, so needless to say, the collaboration and synchronization between the teams and projects and products are challenging to say the least.\n\nFor historical reason, different parts of the organization has adopted different methods; some departments work with rolling 6-month plans, some with Pi-planning. Some use Value Streams and Agile Release Trains. Some teams work scrum-ish, other kanban-ish, some do both and some teams do waterfall-ish disguised in iterations. And all the knowledge is in the walls or hidden in Confluence, preferably not version controlled or up-to-date. Even better if it's on someone's personal confluence/SharePoint page. Bonus points if said person has left the company. 🤯 \n\nDespite all of this - so far removed from any theory - we actually not only ship products in a fairly regulated field, we're even doing well, growing, being profitable, and are market leader in mist countries were active in. 😲 \n\nI guess it proves that \"if there's a will, there's a way\", rather than focusing on which method to use.\n\nPersonally, I think it also shows that it is possible to combine agile on a team-level while still being able to run predictable projects on a company level. But it can most certainly be done in a more efficient way. Since I've been in the embedded software industry for 25+ years, I've spend quite some time thinking about those challenges.",

          "text": "Here's the biggest problem about asking this question.\n\n1. You have too many die hard purist Scrum/Agile folks who will die on their sword of Scrum is perfect, and you, your company, your CTO all don't know what you're doing.\n\n2. You'll have the next set of people who will agree with you and tell you that you'll be fine and waterfall is fine, and that going back in time is fine, and everything can be fine - as long as you have great people, you'll be fine.\n\n3. And finally, you'll have hybrid, Yes, you can tweak/try/plan whatever, without actually any tangible suggestions.\n\nEveryone loves to critique, but people here come from all audience and their feedback will be based on their frame of reference. Take their feedback as it is - opinions.\n\nHere's what you and your boss have to understand.\n\n70% of Waterfall projects failed. Agile didn't fair any better 66% of Agile projects fails. Most that fail belong to the \"medium and large\" size groups. Plenty of metrics on this released by multiple sources. Scrum, is part of the 66%.\n\nWhat's being sold - SAFe - stay away. Nothing good ever comes from doing it, but executives still buy this junk. Outside of wasting a ton of money, it doesn't change anything at the team level and only adds to the bureaucracy. \n\nHere's what else - everyone talks about successful implementations and transformations - they are all stories. NOT TRUE! Maybe someone did something and something was finally given credit as a success, whatever that means. I'm just sick and tired of these stories because most companies are full of dysfunction at every level.\n\nNow on to solution:\n\nFirst, CTO has a vision to add teams to the project - great, that's his vision. Now he should demonstrate the ability to deliver on this vision. He will run into the scalability issue right away. I've been a right hand man of a Sr VP of Eng on a large re-write project of 200 people in 6000 people company. Fought this battle first hand. \n\n1. I agree with someone who posted to add teams one a time. Don't just drop 10 teams in and tell them go on day 1. Won't happen. You need to start with one team, get it to perform, then after that launch other teams but transfer members from the original team so they can lead and show them how things are done.\n\n2. Process - if teams operate differently on every team, it won't work! Spotify failed in its model, though they described a good \"learning\" story. They use Scrum now ... apparently.\n\n3. You need centralized product goals and visibility so you can drive alignment. \n\n4. Architecture problem that needs to be solved and has tradeoffs: If you have all feature Teams, then you'll have no control or governance over architecture.... If you have all component Teams they will have better approach to a design but they will be siloed. No solution is perfect here, the tradeoffs are real. As number of Teams increase, you'll begin having a set of both Component Teams like Platform that will be providing architecture and services for other Teams. And you'll have Feature Teams that can build everything except touch Platform. Platform teams need to be scaled by consisting of the best people - cannot have a bottle neck there, or things will stall EVERYWHERE.\n\n5. Talent - large initiatives are done wrong - people are not asked to volunteer but are \"reassigned\" from other initiatives. Usually the people re-assigned are ones that can be released from one team. Critical, best people are always kept on other projects. What does that give you? The least productive and experienced bunch. Good luck with that too. So you need to recruit people from other areas in business - the best people. Or, you need to hire the right people. Also, don't just put a bunch of people together and call them a Team. Get them to naturally form Teams - try mob programming, hackathon events, but let them self create teams - they will be the strongest and the comradery built out will be better. Once you have 2-3 people on the team, let them recruit others for the purpose of growing their team themselves - selecting who they want to be part of the team. Natural leaders will evolve. But... this takes time.\n\n6. Inevitable tooling problem. Jira sucks and lacks visibility for a large project. Linear provides good tool but every Team is for itself. Metrics in both suck. Based on this... good luck getting there. \n\nThere's more to talk about, but I'm tired of typing, sorry :) If you'd like DM, me and we can explore more. Glad to answer any questions also.  \n",

          "text": "**Here's the gist:**\n\nAfter 14 years at Google, the core realization is that thriving engineers aren't necessarily the best programmers — they're the ones who navigate people, politics, alignment, and ambiguity well. The post distills 21 hard-won lessons: start from user problems rather than cool technology, prioritize collective alignment over being right, ship imperfect work to learn from reality, write clear code instead of clever code, and treat novel technology choices as scarce \"innovation tokens\" best spent only where you uniquely must innovate. It emphasizes that your code won't advocate for you — people do, so make your impact legible. At scale, even bugs become dependencies users rely on, and most slow teams suffer from misalignment, not lack of effort. Writing and teaching sharpen your own understanding, glue work is vital but must stay visible and bounded, and every metric exposed to management will eventually be gamed (so pair speed metrics with quality ones). Admitting what you don't know builds psychological safety, your professional network outlasts any single job, and most performance gains come from eliminating unnecessary work rather than optimizing what remains. Process should reduce uncertainty, not create paper trails, and eventually time becomes worth more than money. The throughline: expertise compounds through deliberate practice, and a long engineering career ultimately revolves around people — the users you build for and the teammates you build with.\n\nIf the summary seems inacurate, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually 👍\n\n[^(Click here for more info, I read all comments)](https://www.reddit.com/user/fagnerbrack/comments/195jgst/faq_are_you_a_bot/)",

You can try all features free, no card required for 30 days.\n\nApologies for being a corporate shill, but I'm hoping this helps your team and current issues.\n\nOne of the other commenters made a good point though, this may be less a software issue and more an async culture issue.

We use it for visualizing our backlog on a user story map. We are an agency so we have many new projects all the time and we prefer to kick them off with story mapping sessions. I found this approach really helpful. We can map out our application focusing on real user value from start to end while gaps and risks are popping up early before we even commit to write a single line of code. Pretty useful in discovery and refinement as well. It works great to define user personas, map out their journeys and build our releases and prioritize user stories. There is even an AI in the tool that saves some time adding details to our user stories as well. StoriesOnBoard really helps us to always access up-to-date information of our projects and sync changes with Jira or Azure DevOps. Our team is a big fan of it. However, you should consider to rethink your workflow to become more efficient. A great tool is indeed comes with benefits but you also need to make sure it is aligned with your needs.  ",

We are lucky to have a few core higly skilled folks who are very experienced in their own fields. Our biggest challenge was that our BAs and PMs had to context-switch between different UI/UX for planning, which killed our internal efficiency. We do all our high-level discovery, journey mapping, and release slicing in StoriesOnBoard regardless of the client's tech stack.

By analyzing the persona details against our project scope, it identifies missing user goals, suggests journey steps we might have overlooked, and spots gaps in the overall flow.

Have your product owner refine stories ahead of time, get initial estimates through async voting (planning poker style), then use your sync time just for the conversations that actually need everyone together - the tricky estimates, dependencies, and final commitment. Tools like Miro or Mural work well for the collaborative mapping piece, and something like TeamRhythm can handle the story mapping and estimation workflow right in Jira if that's where you live.  \n  \nFor retros, the key is making sure people can contribute thoughts before the meeting so you're not sitting in awkward silence waiting for folks to think. Anonymous input helps loads when people are in different comfort zones with speaking up across timezones. The voting and grouping can happen live, but get the initial brain dump done async first.  \n  \nThe biggest thing we see teams get wrong is trying to make everything synchronous when you've got that timezone spread. Accept that some collaboration has to happen in stages, and focus your precious sync time on the decisions that actually need discussion rather than information gathering.",

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nI’m at a bit of a career crossroads and would really appreciate some perspective from people who’ve made a similar move.\n\nI’ve got ~10 YOE since getting my CS degree. Mostly worked as an Android dev. But also during 2020-2021 spent 2 years running my own gaming server company, which did pretty well.\n\nTechnically I’m more of a generalist / mid-level dev. But over the past couple of years I’ve realized that I create way more value (and get way more satisfaction) doing PO / Scrum Master type work than actually coding.\n\nStuff like prioritizing. Clarifying requirements. Aligning business + devs. Making tradeoffs. Shipping. Strategizing. That energizes me way more than debating architecture or watching dev colleagues overengineer stuff for tiny gains...\n\nI’m seriously considering transitioning full-time into a Product Owner role. Long-term goal would be PM / EM, maybe even CTO someday.\n\nI know that probably means taking around ~40% pay cut, starting as junior/mid PO, proving myself all over again and etc. I’m okay with that. I’d even intern for free for a bit if that's what it would take. \n\nMy issue is positioning. I’ve done PO-ish responsibilities. I’ve run a business. I understand tech and stakeholders. But I’ve never officially held the “Product Owner” title.\n\nHow do I avoid looking like “dev who’s bored of coding” and instead come across as legit PO material?\n\nIs getting something like PSPO from Scrum.org worth it?\n\nFor devs who transitioned — how did you land your first role?\n\nAny red flags I should watch for when joining a company as a PO?\n\nWould really appreciate any tips.",

We interview a lot of Engineers who want to transition, and if you do not have the correct mindset, its an uphill battle.\n\nYou need to understand first and foremost, what is the problem the user/customer/stakeholder is having. Do they themselves even understand what the problem is. How do you then prioritize what problem to focus on, and once thats understood, how do you agree or identify an appropriate Outcome to aim towards, and how will this be measured (KPIs etc) - this speaks to your ability to work through a Discovery and Framing session appropriately and sets the scene for what comes next.\n\nOnce these are known, you can then start to incept your backlog, and create actual user stories, NOT technical requirements\n\nToo many Devs who become a PO cannot relinquish technical control, and keep dictating to teams a singular solution based around requirements, rather than user stories. Your role is to act as the voice of the customer, and translate their problems into Stories (or Spikes). Its then up to your engineers to identify a way they feel best meets the Acceptance Criteria to deliver usable value to a user quickly, and get feedback as often as possible.",

Because I've seen multiple times PO's acting more like dreamers, coming up with very abstract use cases which led to abstract designs that seemed to have been built basically in a vacuum, not taking into account how product operates and so on. Heck devs even had to estimate spikes without any designs ready based on abstract use cases alone. In such cases us devs had to step in often and basically perform proper discovery, define AC and requirements ourselves, because our PO seemed to perform more of PM/Scrum master duties instead of u know, PO.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but best PO's I ever worked with would give me ready tickets to work on, with figma sketch, backend contracts and all scenarios (use cases) ready, and if I ever had a doubt or a question the required info was a quick 5min call away, instead of me as a dev having to reverse engineer business decisions or drive communication with 3 other teams myself.",

You've run an actual business, you understand the tech side, and the stuff you listed that energizes you is literally the job. Most POs I've seen came from business analyst roles and have never shipped anything in their lives.\n\nThe PSPO, look I'm not gonna tell you certifications are useless because they do get you past HR filters. But be real about what it is. You're paying $200 for a keyword on your resume. The actual material is a few pages. It won't teach you anything you don't already know from running a gaming server company that actually made money. That experience is worth ten times the cert.\n\nThe \"dev who's bored of coding\" thing, flip it. You're not a dev who's bored. You're a dev who realized he creates more value on the product side and has the technical background to actually understand what the team is building. That's rare. Most POs write user stories and have no idea what's technically feasible. You do. That's your entire pitch.\n\nRed flags when joining as PO: if the company already has a \"product committee\" or \"stakeholder board\" that makes all the real decisions, you're not a PO, you're a ticket writer. Ask in interviews who actually decides what gets built. If the answer is vague you have your answer.\n\nSkip the free intern thing. You ran a business, charge what you're worth.",

In this hiring environment, it’s hard for decision makers to take the risk on someone doing a career transition. So you gotta give them confidence that it’s already how you have been operating. Keep in mind it’s your resume, you can highlight your skills and title to best align with your next career goals. Don’t worry about being too literal.

Then they did a tender for supplier which was won by an Indian company, forcing most of the agile senior folks to be pushed out (there would now be supplied by said company). For full context more than 80% of the folks in their out department were external contractors, so this lead to a massive turn over. \n\nUnfortunately, while this new supplier claimed to understand agile development principles and practices, all their new scrum masters were basically project managers or architects; Senior personnel relabeled to satisfy the customers requirements. I was one of the last scrum masters from the old group left to try and help them understand their role (and massive challenge). \n\nI kept in contact with my former product owner. He  told me that 6 months after I had gone there was little left of what we built. A full reset he called it. There were still a few people from the old org trying their best to rebuild but it never really fully recovered from the big reset. \n\nFast forward to today: the company which was once the template for small and competitive telco was sold by its mother company to venture capitalists. Scrum master roles were stripped, and their accountability shifted to the product owner, making them effective project managers. \n\nThe services provided by the telco have declined over time. Recently they were in the news regarding a hack and data leak scandal. While hacks are unavoidable in the long run, the size of the data leak and the sensitivity of the user data feels like something the old company would never have had let happen. Then again I might be biased. \n\nIt’s an immensely sad thing to see all your efforts so carelessly tossed overboard for the sake of chasing lower costs. While the two years I was there didn’t feel like a complete waste of time (I gained a lot of experience) uit sucks to see all the results of your labor being wiped out.",

I also believe this aligns with the current philosophy of everyone can now be product or that product can be developers with the help of AI. The next year is going to be interesting to see which direction gains traction and how long it will take to correct. I’m not saying that positions won’t be eliminated but there are still reasons you need different roles, but I do think it is lining up to be a power struggle between product and engineering driven by pressure from ELT to eliminate positions and show productivity gains with AI.",

He formed it but wanted to use it as a vessel to do certification, which many of the other founders (being of that homebrew and self learned ilk) disliked as a fundamental concept. So much so, this idea of \"no certification\" was baked into the DNA of the Agile Alliance.\n\nSo he founded the Scrum Alliance with Mike Cohn and Esther Derby to do certification. Mike and Esther agreed as long as it was a non-profit and not a money making scheme.\n\nKen agreed.\n\nA few  years later, Ken was \"asked to leave\" the Scrum alliance due to something irregular that no one \\*publicly\\* speaks about. Ken spun this as some noble sacrifice and him leaving due to these awful other people. I have heard it was more prosaic and base then that. \n\nAnd then he set up Scrum.org. A private business dedicated to making Ken money. Of which it has made him millions. Remember he owns the PSM test himself and receives all the revenue from it directly. \n\nI have known Ken a long time. He is a hard man to like. He made a great post about his behaviour, a few years ago - [https://kenschwaber.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/i-was-thinking/](https://kenschwaber.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/i-was-thinking/)\n\nI hundred percent respect him - and am very aligned philosophically with him - But he is no man to idolise. \n\n  \n",

The anchor is the things that didn’t go well, what held your team back etc. the wind is what went well. The sun is the overall planning that went into it (what was useful from sprint planning). I’ve forgotten what the rock is…. Then share this into a shared lucid chart and have everyone add sticky notes in the sections and set a timer for a few minutes. It keeps everyone engaged and doesn’t drag out the session.\n\nIn regards to sprint planning, I’d highly suggest planning poker, where you play poker with Fibonacci cards and give a number based on how long said task would take. It’s a bit more complex than this but have a look online.\n\nSide recommendation, adopt vertical slicing in sprint planning. Send a msg if you want to know more about it or search it up online!",

If other people have dealt with this situation, could you share a bit of guidance?\n\nWe have a new project that we're trying to use Agile for.  It's pretty loose, using Scrum components (sprints, estimation, backlog, ect).  However, a large portion of the project is investigation and business knowledge gathering before any Dev work can begin.  The Devs on the team (me plus two others) are expected to put most of our working time on the tasks, but we have other projects and maintenance to do...and we are the only Devs.  In addition, a lot of the rest of the team (business and system analysts) are also swamped with work outside of the project.\n\nThe project is very important, but I've only worked with teams before that commit nearly 80%+ of their time to said project and are insulated from outside factors and meetings.  How do you juggle this kind of time in an Agile/Scrum framework when the external forces aren't something you can realistically control?",

After the spike you may need to adjust the development story based on what you learned.\n\nThe other facet of your question seems to be related to capacity. Story points and sprints are great, but if you ignore capacity, you're likely to make promises you can't keep.\n\nStart by defining a meaningful pointing system. Day-points is the simplest pointing system I've used. A 2 and a 3 point story should take roughly the same time as a single 5 point story. Same is true for a 5 and a 3 point story being equivalent to a single 8 point story. Define your capacity as the number of available days during the sprint or increment. Carve out time for overhead (meetings, training, drive-bys), which is likely to be at least 20%. Commit to stories with the highest business value up to your capacity.",

Which is the company compromising on?\n\nRegardless of the choice of compromise, what I've done is create a roadmap and a general timeline for these things, so you at least have some numbers to showcase the options and how each affects the project. At that point it can be discussed with decision makers. After that, you can decide on whether to:\n\n1. Compromise on scope\n2. Compromise on timeline\n3. Compromise on resources (not always possible or a linear improvement)\n\nThese aren't even mutually exclusive, often removing some things from the scope also reduces the timeline and the required resources. I'm partial towards compromising on scope and that generally works better for who I work with, especially since timeline compromises typically also mean cost and risk increases; I've seen better results by having phased approaches.\n\nIf you have a small team and a relatively small timeline but a big scope, then the outlier seems to be that the scope is disproportionately large. Or is it? Answering that alone should give you some direction.\n\nAs for the other projects, you'll just have to assume you can't put 40 hrs/week per dev on this new project. It would also be worthwhile figuring out how many hours you *should* be putting towards these other existing projects.",

Effective agile delivery acts to control your business risk in a lightweight way;  what you are describing is a long way from that in terms of technical practice**.\n\nScrum requires the whole team working on one project to be effective.\n\nThere's some really solid reasons for this;  the main one is around \"context switching\"\n\n\\- a 2017 study showed you lose about 20% of the teams effectiveness when they work on 2 or more projects;  that's consistent with the data I have collected on just throughput/velocity terms over the years\n\n\\- Gloria Mark's research shows the core of the problem - you tend to get shoulder tapped on project (A) while you are working project (B); that not only interrupts \"flow\" (with a 15-25 minute recovery time), but also leads people to work longer \"to catch up\" and creates stress\n\n\\- Stress lowers our \"working memory\";  you'll get more slips, lapses and mistakes from team members, so more test-and re-work cycles slowing you down\n\n\\- that's more likely to force you towards \"deliberate violations\";  compromising on technical quality to reach a deadline or target, with the consequential \"long tail\" of defects, bugs and problems\n\n**You get into a downward spiral;  context switching kills quality and productivity, and the defects that arise creates more context switching.**\n\n**More critically perhaps, the sequence you describe has nothing to do with agility, at all.**\n\nYou are talking about upfront-requirements-and-design, feeding through to developers.  \nSo very much a stage-gate based delivery model, with analysis and sign offs, in order to control risk.\n\nThat's exactly the kind of \"heavyweight\" approach that agility is designed to disrupt;  you don't control risk through upfront design processes, you control it by\n\n**- having the technical skills in place so change is cheap, easy, fast and safe (no new defects)**  \n**- you get fast feedback on the value created by that change from real users**\n\nYou drop the upfront analysis and the \"contractual\" sign-off relationship with users, and instead have them embedded in the team, collaboratively working continuously to make sure what is built is correct.\n\n**As long as change is not expensive, hard, slow or risky, this is cheaper and faster.**\n\nMy only suggestion here would be \"The Kanban Method\" -\n\n\\- start where you are now  \n\\- make the work and dependencies visible  \n\\- get agreement to evolve how you work  \n\\- apply systems thinking and theory of constraints ideas  \n\\- ruthlessly improve to reduce cycle times  \n\\- apply \"shift left\" concepts to defect prevention (DevOps / XP)  \n\\- STOP worrying about individual utilisation of people  \n\\- START worrying about how work flows, and the delays in handoffs\n\nThe state of your code-base and the investment in technical skill development will dictate whether agile approaches will control your business risk on not - but it might be a long haul (years) to get there.",

The tension between \"pure\" agile and practical constraints is something most teams face.  \n  \nThe investigation phase you're describing actually fits well within agile frameworks. The key is being transparent about capacity. If you're only available 60% of the time due to maintenance work, plan your sprints accordingly rather than pretending you have full capacity.  \n  \nFor the context switching between projects, successful teams often establish \"maintenance windows\" or dedicated support rotations rather than having everyone juggle both constantly. Some teams also find it helpful to have one person act as a buffer for urgent maintenance issues during sprint time, rotating this responsibility.

The emphasis is on intrnsic motivation and leadership, not extrinsic motivation and management (***\"Out of the Crisis\" - Deming***)  \n  \n\\- change is not cheap, easy, fast and safe (no new defects);  without this, management will never shift their mindset, because when change is expensive, hard, slow and risky then the cost of failure leads to the need for control.  The fear of being scapegoated pushes you back towards heavyweight bureaucratic  processes, and stage-gate relases  \n  \n\\- you don't get fast feedback from actual users on the value created, inside the development cycle;  everything becomes about performative metrics, not actually measuring value created and using that to respond to change  \n  \nhowever the all point to   \n  \n\\- **under investment in technical and non-technical professional development at the team level**\n\nLeadership training only for managers; non pf the negotiation, conflict resolution, communication, facilitation and presentation skills developed in teams, so that leaders can lead not manage.  Zero technical training in 25-year old practices that help teams to deliver in days.\n\n  \n",

That so long as a company can overcome all the other response options you listed - and likely more - that they will then be considered nominally Agile and home-free so long as they stay on top of it.\n\nAgile as it's understood and practiced by the LinkedIn class today is not about process and delivery, but instead is a tool for performance management and blame.  For this, I consider the notion of agile (little-a) scorched Earth. Though I would still say that the original manifesto is a valuable piece of industry wisdom.  It just needs a rebrand.\n\n(I have experienced SAFe and other cargo cultings of agile in a professional setting with both multinational and small organizations alike.
