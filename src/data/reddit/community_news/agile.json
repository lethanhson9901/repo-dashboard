      "text": "I’ve been working at this company for 10 years, currently as a manager overseeing several IT teams. The company has its own internal IT department building internal products. When I started, we were moving from classic waterfall to Scrum. Like in any big corporation (2,000+ people in IT alone), it was slow and painful.\n\nDemos were basically walking through the backlog and accounting for every single task. Sprints had no real goal. Former analysts became Product Owners, and people with the least actual work were sent to Scrum Master trainings. Dailies were used by team leads to check if everyone was “doing something.” The organization cared about how much we delivered and how late it was - not *what* we delivered or what value it brought. A textbook “agile transformation.”\n\nBut after a few years, real change started to show. POs really dug into their domains and had deep knowledge of customers and competitors. IT invested in DevOps to speed up releases. Architecture evolved from one big monolith deployed 5 times a year into hundreds of independent microservices deployed on demand. Backlogs started to reflect actual customer needs instead of just task lists. Employee engagement scores were well above industry average in every survey. Over all of this watched a transformation department made up of Scrum Masters and change leaders.\n\nThen the board changed.\n\nThe new board introduced a new one-year strategy. This strategy had little to do with the product visions owned by individual POs and was pushed into IT through side channels. Chaos followed. Suddenly the board started blaming department directors for not delivering *their* goals. Directors started holding POs accountable for their existing roadmaps while trying to kill future increments to make room for “the strategy.” At the same time, IT directors bypassed POs entirely and pushed architectural changes under the label of “technical debt.”\n\nTeams ended up with three priorities: one from the PO, one from “the business,” and one from IT. Every delay caused fights between these three sides, finger-pointing, and accountability theater. A year passed. The board’s strategy was not delivered.\n\nSo the board decided to fire the entire transformation department (including all Scrum Masters) and introduced “improvement actions” to make sure this would never happen again.\n\nThose improvements included:\n\n* assigning an additional Project Manager to every PO to “help deliver projects on time”\n* abandoning story points in favor of estimating every task in days\n* limiting time for technical debt and bugs (!) to 10% and strictly enforcing reporting\n* hiring additional analysts to create Feature Requirement Documents for every product to “help IT estimate better and improve predictability”\n\nAll of this, of course, branded as *improving our agile way of working*.\n\nThat was 6 months ago.\n\nMore than half of the teams I know haven’t released a single change to production since then. Some teams still haven’t received FRDs for any change at all - analysts have been working on documentation for 6 months, and IT doesn’t even know what’s in it yet. I personally reviewed one of those documents (they had dependencies on my system) and saw that an FRD for a simple change was already 100 pages long.\n\nAt one point they asked me to confirm a single variable. I told them I’d look at it in a month because I was working on something else. They replied that in a month they’d already be assigned to another project and wouldn’t be able to update the document anymore.\n\nI’ve also heard Project Managers explicitly telling teams *not* to log time spent on technical debt, because we’d burn through our yearly 10% too fast and wouldn’t have any left for “more important bugs” later.\n\n10 years of transformation.  \nBuried in 6 months.\n\nI’m watching all of this from the sidelines. My department hasn’t gone through the new “transformation” yet and we’re still working the old way - just the team and the PO. We’re the last department in line for the great enlightenment. I’m going to try to use this time to prove to everyone above that the “old” system can still be efficient. Wish me luck - the last island of agility in this waterfall of despair.\n\nIn my opinion, the board threw the baby out with the bathwater. After the first year they clearly lost trust in POs and dismantled the entire system instead of trying other approaches. Not all POs were good at their job, and that’s probably the most important lesson I’m taking away from this whole story: being a PO is brutally hard and comes with real responsibility. Not everyone is cut out for it, and not everyone should take on that role. And paradoxically, over the last few months the best POs left, while the worst ones stayed - still pretending to be product owners, even though most of their decision-making power is already gone.",

          "text": "This is one of the most honest posts I've read here in a while. \n\nThe part that's going to bother people is that both sides of your story prove the same thing. Agile was never the variable. Organizational power structure was.   \n\nWhen the old board gave teams space, invested in DevOps, let POs grow into their domains, things improved. Not because of Scrum. Because leadership created conditions where competent people could do good work.   \n\nWhen the new board showed up they didn't kill Agile. They killed the conditions that made it work. Then blamed the framework for failing. Then replaced it with 100-page FRDs and project managers layered on top of POs. That's just waterfall with extra steps and a body count.   \n\nThe part about PMs telling teams not to log technical debt time. That's not process improvement. That's cooking the books. Everyone in the room knows it but nobody can say it because the people who created the rule are the ones who'd have to hear it.   \n\nYour observation about the best POs leaving while the worst stayed is a pattern I've seen over and over. You strip decision-making power from a role, the people who were good at making decisions leave. The ones who were always just going through the motions don't even notice the difference.   \n\nGood luck being the last island, I mean that. But start documenting your results now., delivery frequency, incident rates, team retention. When the \"great enlightenment\" reaches your department, the only thing that might save you is numbers that make someone above pause before flipping the switch.",

Organization leaders will make or break any organizational transformation; and new leadership that lacks understanding of the current approach can easily destroy all progress with a few insufficiently-thought out changes. \n\nEvery successful transformation had full support from senior leaders. Every failure involved one of two factors: for whatever reason the senior leader refused to enforce the changes and gave people 'wriggle room' to not adopt the changes or to selectively adopt things, or the senior leader actively sabotaged the transformation. \n\nToo many times, a successful transformation that had been in place and working fantastically well for several years was destroyed by new management coming in, not understanding the current approach and why it worked, rejecting it for summary reasons (\"this is not how to do software\" or \"my way is better\") and destroying all progress. As a result, I've taken a client from bad to excellent, seen excellent endure for several years, then the people who grew up with the system leave, new leaders come in, and everything is scrapped. \n\nI realize that I'm an Agile Sisyphus... you know, the guy who was condemned by the Gods to roll a boulder to the top of the hill, and just as he reached the top the Gods would come in and give the boulder a shove so that it rolled back to the bottom so Sisyphus could start all over. I guess it means good coaches and consultants will always have a job, but in reality it's sad and disappointing to see people destroy what they don't understand.",

Eventually the company started to shift in things that actually matter.

      "text": "Yesterday was the 25th anniversary of the Agile Manifesto. The CEO of PMI posted a celebration on LinkedIn and announced a new product: the Manifesto for Enterprise Agility, launching March 3rd.\n\nIn his post, he shared a stat: 85% of executives say agility is critical, but only 32% are satisfied with implementation. A 53-point gap.\n\nI have a small page that critiques Agile frameworks. 5 followers. I left a comment asking a simple question: if the original manifesto couldn't close this gap in 25 years, what does a new one offer that the previous ones didn't?\n\nNo links, no pitch, no product, just a question using his own data.\n\nHis first response: \"I don't think you got the point. It's NOT about software development.\" Except his own post opens by celebrating the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and how it revolutionized software development, the software context was entirely his.\n\nI pointed this out politely and repeated the question.\n\nHis second response (edited before posting): \"You don't seem to understand, or you pretend not to understand. Please promote your services directly without using me or PMI.\"\n\nFive followers, zero links, zero services mentioned. Just one question about his own data. Then my comment pointing out the contradiction was removed.\n\nI have screenshots of the entire interaction, the post is public, everything is documented.\n\nNot sharing this to complain, sharing it because the response pattern is exactly what the Agile industrial complex does at every level: when you question the framework, you become the problem. The question never gets answered.\n\nStill waiting for someone to explain what manifesto number six offers that the first five didn't.\n\nAnyway, has anyone else had this experience questioning the Agile establishment publicly?",

So he reacted from a place of (slight) arrogance and (lots of) fear. Uncertainty is scary after all. \n\nBTW The PMI are as agile (and indeed Agile) as the least agile thing you could imagine. A large concreted block of concrete, concreted into some more concrete.  \n\nThis new endeavour is an attempt to revitalise the PMI Agilealliance. The non-profit that was originally set up by many of the original manifesto authors to advocate for agile ideas, methods and principles. It funded itself via its large Agile conference Agile20XX which due to Covid, the changing world etc has now failed to generate any profit (indeed costing millions) and so the AA had to find a partner/owner to support them otherwise they would have perished. \n\nThey were effectively consumed by the PMI and the PMI are now working out what to do with this new potential product set. \n\nBTW It's worthwhile not treating the \"agile industrial complex\" (an utterly ridiculous phrase and idea) as one whole thing. It's a series of organisations with very different drivers, needs and wants. It's definitely worth your while understanding the difference and analysing it. It would help with any critique you would like to make. \n\nIn this case, you, a person with an obvious grudge to share but no followers or indeed weight, went after someone of huge \"heft\" but zero agile knowledge. Neither of you have come out looking very good. As someone who likes Agile but hates this direction - I think I'm left happy. 😃",

No-one ran CI/CD pipelines from tape.    \n\nA good chunk of the problems people post here are from ignoring those basic values and principles, and wondering why things go wrong, which is a sign of how much the surface \"project management\" frameworks overtook the need for technical excellence.  \n\nEnterprises change direction fast.\n\nThey do this by acquisitions and divestments.   \n  \nWhich means they would rather lay-off 2000 people and by a new company, because it's lower cost and less risk than trying to pivot those 2000 people to a new business domain or market.\n\nWe are seeing this happen, in real time.",

Might steal that if you don't mind.\n\nThe 43 manifestos point is perfect, at some point the format itself became the product. Write values, add principles, sell training. Rinse repeat.\n\nAnd the acquisition point is the real answer to \"enterprise agility.\" Companies don't pivot 2000 people. They fire 2000 people and buy a company that already has what they need. That's the actual enterprise agility. No manifesto required. Just a checkbook and a layoff plan.\n\nYou clearly think about this stuff deeper than most people posting in these threads.

Product Owner seeing a feature for the first time in sprint review is just MAD.  \n\n2. How can a team miss a \"key\" part and it goes unnoticed the whole sprint? \n\n3. \"The team thought it was complete.\" - That's simply an environment with no collaboration, just occasional communication to validate piled up assumptions.\n\nThat's not agility, that's dysfunction reloaded. Not to mention that Scrum != agility. \n\nI'm planning to start a meetup in my area (Sydney) to exchange principles and practices that enhance agility without fluff to contribute to noise suppression in this industry. \n\nI'd like to hear more if anyone has organised meetups before, or if anyone is interested in joining the club!",

Sydney has enough enterprise shops running cargo cult Agile that you won't run out of war stories.\n\nHere's something I've been working on that might align with what you're building: an Anti-Agile Manifesto. Not anti-agility, anti-industry. Documenting the patterns, naming the dysfunction, exposing how the certification economy and the big consultancies (McKinsey, Accenture, Deloitte) turned a set of good ideas into a billion-dollar extraction machine.\n\nThe C-levels and consultancies that profit from \"transformation\" have never been publicly challenged with data. The CEO of PMI deleted my comment for asking one question. Imagine what happens when a community starts documenting the exposed fraud systematically, the fake certifications, the 65% failure rate the inventor of Scrum admitted, the consultancies billing $500/hr to install ceremonies that teams abandon the moment the contract ends.\n\nIf you're serious about the meetup, I'd be interested in collaborating, even remotely.

No argument there.\n\nBut here's what happened in practice: his own post opened by celebrating the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and how it revolutionized software development. When I pointed that out, instead of engaging with the question he shifted to \"it's NOT about software development\" and accused a 5-follower page of self-promotion for asking what the new manifesto offers that the previous ones didn't. The question about enterprise agility is valid, but the response pattern is the story. Two chances to explain the value of the new manifesto both used to attack the questioner instead.\n\nI wrote the full breakdown with screenshots here if you want to see the actual exchange: [https://agilelie.com/blog/pmi-ceo](https://agilelie.com/blog/pmi-ceo)\n\nThe BA and PM question you're raising is the real one though. Most \"enterprise agility\" initiatives just reorganize existing roles under new titles without changing how decisions actually get made. That's not agility, that's a reorg with better branding.",

Likely because the final version isn't ready, and no one wants to put forth a draft that may see significant change.\n\nI'll step back and ask, what problem is the new manifesto trying to solve? I do think the original Agile Manifesto had a positive impact on software development and on software project management; I adopted Scrum in 2006 and haven't looked back. It certainly is a fantastic lightweight process framework for managing small projects with one or two teams, and Scrum can be extended to be a very powerful and adaptive framework for large projects and programs... I've done it. (I use my own scaling practices, not any of the well-known frameworks.)\n\n  \nI agree: most organizations that have tried Agile transformations have not seen the value. I spent 15 years helping companies... from Microsoft to startups... maximize the benefits of an Agile approach, and had considerable success. Most engagements started with an initial discussion of what the client was currently doing, followed by my simple question: \"Do you want to do Scrum?\" Yes was always the answer, so I'd ask again. \"Do you want to DO Scrum, and not some approximation of Scrum like what you're doing that isn't working?\" That question led to a pause, and then a deeper conversation.",

Because it proves the framework can work when someone with 15 years of experience is in the room asking the hard questions and holding the team accountable to actually doing it. The problem is the industry scaled the framework without scaling people like you, they sold the cert and skipped the \"deeper conversation\" part.\n\nAnyway I'm curious about your own scaling practices though.

It was not perfect, but it was honest and it delivered value more often than excuses.\n\nThen I came to this place that promised a big Agile transformation. What I walked into was project management with a new paint job.\n\nTwo months after I joined, new boss. Zero tech background. His boss? Zero tech background, but twenty plus years of traditional PM thinking and a deep love for dashboards that measure absolutely nothing useful. And the mindset that he’s right about everything and knows everything.\n\nNow we are “Agile” because we hold standups and shove work into ADO, which is a horrible tool, been begging for JIRA since Day 1. Leadership converts story points into days to close like math is optional and common sense is a rumor.\n\nThe newest brilliant idea is a KPI for velocity tracking. Not to help teams improve. Not to learn anything. Just to have a KPI to make it look like we’re doing something.\n\nThey also created a “demand intake process” and tried to make it Agile. It used to be a ticket queue with paperwork. Now it is a ticket queue with epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria that read like a legal contract. Same red tape, just wrapped in Scrum vocabulary.\n\nThere are no real teams. Everyone works on their own thing. Minimal collaboration. Priorities flip every couple of days. Ceremonies are status meetings with new names. Product ownership doesn’t exist, there’s no product. We are not Agile.\n\nSo I am stepping away from Agile for a while. Unless someone at the top decides to actually understand what Agile is, this will never change. They will keep measuring the wrong things, rewarding the wrong behavior, and acting shocked when nothing improves.\n\nAnyone else stuck in a similar Agile transformation?\n\nOh, and my boss uses ChatGPT to reply to every email the team sends now. Is that a new thing people are experiencing? Should I follow suite?",

Acceptance Criteria is crucial for me as tester to be able to deduce how 'well' whatever has been built.  That's not red tape, that's someone doing their job properly when they create PBI's.\n\n'Priorities flip every few days'.  Yup, that's part of having an Agile mindset.  The PO can change their mind about what the team builds every single day if they deem it necessary.  Sure, it's a pain in the arse and it's entirely inefficient, but being able to change direction is exactly what Agile teaches.  \n\nThere's also nothing wrong with velocity tracking, although it should primarily be used by Feature Teams themselves for their own reflection/planning.  Once you start to see external Stakeholders use the metrics, then be cautious.  Caveat, I have seen Finance departments use velocity to calculate the cost of Sprints in order that they fund teams appropriately.  Understanding that there is an eco system around teams is a very good thing.  You don't exist in isolation.  \n\nThere are no ceremonies mentioned in the Agile manifesto.  This sounds like you don't understand things, your points are vague.  Are you referencing Scrum here?  Agile is a set of mindset behaviour and principles, makes no reference to US points or how US's should be formulated for example.  \n\nWhen someone starts to criticise something, I always ask them to suggest something better.

Real Agile gives teams authority to say no, to push back on priorities, to own technical decisions. That's uncomfortable for people who spent 20 years with command-and-control, so they take the vocabulary, keep the structure, and call it transformation.\n\nThe velocity KPI is almost impressively honest though. They're not even hiding it, \"just to have a KPI to make it look like we're doing something\" — at least someone said the quiet part out loud.\n\nThe demand intake process thing is the one that stuck with me. You described a ticket queue with paperwork that became a ticket queue with epics and acceptance criteria. The red tape didn't go away, it got a product backlog and acceptance criteria. That's not transformation, that's liability distribution, now everyone can point to the story and say they followed the process when it fails.\n\nChatGPT emails are a separate disease.

I've since admitted that working remotely can be as productive.\n\nIn-person is much better for activities where a group needs to gain a shared understanding of something. Well-run planning sessions are an example (as compared to someone projecting Jira on a screen while everyone else just watches). Training people is MUCH harder when everyone is remote, but it can be done.\n\nNow counter that with the productivity and mental health gains of not having to commute, working in a comfortable space, being able to take breaks when needed, etc., and I think the gains at least balance the drawbacks.\n\nThere are exceptions, of course, but I'm firmly in the \"get together in person when it makes sense to do to, otherwise work wherever you're most productive\" camp.\n\nAs for the Manifesto, it represents a \"point in time\" state of the industry where we were railing against the massive processes that delivered more binders of requirements and change requests than actual value. We've learned a lot since and I don't think the original needs to be updated. Just go with what we've picked up over the last quarter century.",

I \"grew up\" as a software developer during the same times as the people who wrote it, and experienced the same issues with the massive processes of the 1980s and 1990s. The \"funny\" part is that the complaints I hear today about Scrum and SAFe and other 🐂💩 approaches are the same ones we were making and the same ones that led to the Agile Manifesto being written in the first place!\n\nI'm lucky enough to know several of the authors of the manifesto, count some as friends and to even have worked with some of them. From all that, I know what they were trying to achieve, and for a while in the early 2000s they (we!) did! Things started to go south when the Certified Scrum Master program became popular and you could be \"certified\" after parking your arse in a chair for two days. Scrum also appealed to the project management community because it focused on just that - project management practices - where XP extended those with the technical practices as well.\n\nAnd here we are today, 25 years later, with islands of \"good\" in a vast sea of mediocrity and outright crap. I'm still building software, both hand-writing it and using LLMs, and helping individual teams as I go.\n\nOh, as for no estimates, I haven't estimated a story in years. I have, however, provided forecasts for releases constantly based on progress using story \\*counts\\* (Monte Carlo simulations are fantastic for this). I just break the required work down into the smallest reasonable stories and give a forecast (OK, estimate) based on the delivery rate of prior work. This has worked really well, though I'm sure everyone's mileage will vary. 🤷‍♂️",

We are an architecture/engineering setup with long-running projects, billable hours, resource planning, QA steps, and also a lot of invoicing tied to the work so I feel like Jira feels extremely task-heavy and too focused on software projects to help us with that specifically. We don’t really need epics and sprints as much as we need visibility from proposal to delivery and without integrations if possible tbh. I’m not even sure if this is possible but a girl can dream right?? \n\nCurious what people are using that’s more vertically focused and not just another kanban board with plugins on plugins.",

That's closer to what tools like Teamwork, [Productive.io](http://Productive.io), or even Monday handle out of the box. They're built for agencies and professional services where the project isn't a backlog of stories — it's a scope of work with a budget attached. \n\nThe fact that you already know you don't need epics and sprints means you've already figured out the most important thing.

The only real restriction is you can only have 3 levels of task (epic/issue/subtask) in a project--but a) you can add 2 more if you go cross-project with some of the Advanced Roadmap stuff, and b) you can create issue types that are whatever you want so you don't ever have to use the word epic for any reason. Call 'em phase, subphase, and task if you want.  \n\nDefinitely not a bad idea to look at other stuff, I just look at it and think \"I could make Jira work for that\".",

Scoping, estimating, and committing made sense when a feature took 2 weeks to build. When the feature ships in 2 days, the sprint isn't a timebox anymore, it's a waiting room.\n\nWhat you're experiencing isn't a process problem. It's the process becoming irrelevant. The backlog turns into a history book because the work moves faster than the documentation layer can capture it. Story points become meaningless when the unit of work changes from \"2 weeks of dev effort\" to \"45 minutes of AI-assisted building plus 3 hours of human review.\"\n\nThe teams I've seen handle this well stopped trying to fit AI-speed work into Scrum-speed ceremonies. What actually works:\n\nContinuous flow with a review gate. No sprints, no planning ceremonies. Work moves through a simple pipeline: define → build → review → ship. The human bottleneck isn't building anymore. It's reviewing. So the process should optimize for review quality, not build velocity.\n\nKill the backlog, keep a priority list. 5-10 items max, ordered by business value. No grooming sessions, no estimation. If something is worth doing, it goes on the list. If it's not top 5, it doesn't exist yet.\n\nDaily async check-ins instead of standups. When work completes in hours not weeks, a synchronous morning meeting is already outdated by lunch.\n\nThe new meta isn't a framework, it's accepting that the ceremonies were always just scaffolding for slow delivery. When delivery gets fast, the scaffolding comes down.",

Organizations start to make big changes and then the change fades and they lose attention and momentum. As I read it I thought of how many coaches and scrum masters I've heard tell the same story. However, I also found myself thinking \"This guy needs to be proud of the change he accomplished. Not every company wants or needs to be a B Corp. And over the weekend I thought, \"I should take my own advice.\"\n\nNot every company wants or needs to be Spotify or whatever company you read about. Sure, I worked a company that changed their industry with Scrum and another that saved their company with it, but most just got a little nicer to work at or gained a smoother deployment process, and honestly, good for them.\n\nI also look around at how software is made now vs in the 80's and 90's and wow has Agile made a big change. Anyone else remember just having architects and BAs work on a project for 6 months and then having a thousand-page long requirements doc to hand to developers and then they couldn't ask the architects anything because they were off on another project? You don't see that around much anymore. And testing - remember how we used to do testing? No unit tests, no testing before you call a feature d9ne. Just build the whole damn thing then send 18 months worth of code over to the testing department and watch the bugs come back in swarms. \n\nWe've changed and improved a lot as an industry and Agile has been a big driver of it. People can dislike Agile all they want, but I don't see any of them running back to the old ways of working. Hope that brightens a few people's day.",

Instead of 6 months of planning, 18 months of coding, we now use 1 week of planning, 4 weeks of coding and use sprints to measure that. I'd also say it's somewhat due to tech getting a lot better. Compared to 80s and 90s, we have supercomputers at our disposal and network speeds to match. Makes sense that the development process speeds up as well.\n\nThe problem is, organizations leadership don't want to adapt to an agile mindset. They still operate in that factory era mindset. And it does make sense because the rest of the world, starting from the shareholders, operate in that way. They want future predicions and plans and strategies for months on ahead. They can't just go and wing it, trusting that the entire org pivots if something goes wrong.",

That era was brutal. \n\nBut I think the honest version of this story is messier than \"Agile made things better.\" What actually killed the old way wasn't the Agile Manifesto. It was version control getting better, CI/CD becoming practical, cloud infrastructure making deployment cheap, and the internet forcing shorter feedback loops. The tooling changed the game. Agile gave it a name and a framework.   \n\nThe part that concerns me is when \"we're better than the 90s\" becomes the bar. Yeah, we are. But that's a low bar. We went from no testing to checkbox testing. From no collaboration to ceremony-driven collaboration. From waterfall to sprints that often run like mini-waterfalls anyway.   \n\nBetter than the 90s? Absolutely. As good as we could be? Not even close.   I don't think the people frustrated with Agile want to go back, they want to go forward. Past the certifications, past the theater, past the process that replaced one kind of rigidity with another. The original manifesto was about people and outcomes. What most of us live with daily is Jira workflows and sprint velocity charts.   \n\nSo yeah. Take the win. The industry is better. But let's not confuse \"better than awful\" with \"good.\"",

Units of work are independent of the people/team doing the work, just as a mile is a mile regardless of who's running it. \n\nIn your world, it might be better just to calculate an 'issue velocity,' i.e., how many tickets your team (not individuals) can process to completion per unit of time (weekly or bi-weekly, whichever makes sense). What makes this useful for your team is that it gives you something concrete to use to assess process changes; if you come with idea to improve the way your team works and implement it, then issue velocity should increase. \n\nLean teams use throughput (the same thing as issue velocity), cycle time (the time it takes for an issue/work item to go through the entire workflow from when work actually starts on it until it's complete), and lead time (cycle time plus the time the issue waits from when it's created until work actually starts). These are three good metrics that can tell you how well you're doing, whether process changes increase efficiency or decrease it, and give you an idea of how long customers have to wait to get issues resolved. They are basic for process improvement, too.\n\nYour team should focus on the Lean metrics, measure them for a few weeks to get a baseline (a statistic of 1 is useless), and then try a process improvement change to see what impact it has on the metrics.\n\nI will tell you that I've worked with many teams (in the hundreds) and used these simple metrics plus techniques from Theory of Constraints and the Kanban Method to double, triple, even quadruple throughput in 90 days.",

We see teams have better conversations when they focus on lead time (how long from idea to customer), throughput (how many items delivered per sprint), and cycle time (active work time). These translate better to business outcomes than abstract story points.  \n  \nFor newer agile teams, I'd also suggest tracking things like how often scope changes mid-sprint, retrospective action completion rates, and maybe simple health metrics like team confidence in their sprint goals. These give leadership insight into maturity and trajectory without the meaningless velocity comparisons between teams.  \n  \nWhat specific outcomes is your leadership hoping to understand with these metrics?

But velocity is a critical metric of teams running sprints. In fact if you are not tracking velocity, then why bother with sprints at all? I take it a step further and teams running sprints should track for a velocity variance of +/-10%. Because if you have a team that has a velocity of 44, but looking at the last 5 sprints if they have sprints of 48, 63, 29, 47, 32, those are wildly different outcomes painting a picture of instability, which would then spring the question, why? was it due to holidays, PTO, or did work get stuck then get flooded, low backlog health. Velocity for sprint teams is absolutely crucial for many more reasons as well.\n\n",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** Story mapping is a brilliant concept but doesn't scale to large, multi-team programs. I spent several years evolving story mapping into strata mapping, turning it from facilitation art into algorithmic process so I could use maps for both simple, single-team projects and  large, multi-team complex projects with regulatory constraints. Here's why that matters.\n\n# Why I Needed Something Different\n\nIn 2009, I had recently left a role as Group Program Manager running a 100-person product team working on mobile device platform and application software. I'd moved into consulting, helping large companies re-plan and rescue failing projects.\n\nThese weren't small team efforts. These were complex, multi-team programs with distributed workforces, regulatory constraints, and millions of dollars at stake in domains like aerospace, medical devices, financial applications, even silicon chip design. These product domains aren't suitable for continuous releases to customers without extensive testing, because the cost of releasing is very high due to regulatory requirements. If you get a feature wrong, the regulatory requirements alone might take a year to satisfy before the next release. Dumping feature or functional experiments on end users in these environments is bad for business.\n\nThat's when I encountered Jeff Patton at Agile 2009 in Chicago, explaining story mapping on a hallway wall. His approach interested me immediately. I could see the potential. Organizing work around user activities and workflows made intuitive sense. It was far better than the flat, prioritized backlogs most teams were struggling with.\n\nBut I also saw the constraints that would render it ineffective for my needs. It was too team-focused for large, multi-team programs and heavily dependent on skilled facilitation. It wasn't easy to replicate across projects or teams. It was an art, not a process I could teach and then hand to a project team and say \"use this.\"\n\n# The Problem with \"Art\" at Scale\n\nWhen you're rescuing a $50M failing program with thousands of backlog items, hundreds of people across multiple teams, distributed locations, regulatory constraints and hard deadlines, facilitation art hits limits. Three specific problems emerged: skilled facilitators don't scale (I couldn't be in every planning session), maps became \"one and done\" artifacts that gathered dust during execution, and inconsistent approaches across teams made integration nearly impossible.\n\nYet we still needed Agile benefits because large projects invariably have large uncertainty and risk. The answer: approach planning in a truly agile manner that embraces uncertainty and responds effectively to change. That required process, not craft.\n\n# Four Years of Evolution\n\nFrom 2009-2013, I identified and resolved issues as I used variations on story mapping for large projects.\n\nI found that starting with users and benefits (rather than activities) made everything clearer. Stories flowed naturally from understanding user needs. This became the anchor for consistent results across teams. Better yet, Users and Features became natural units for higher-level planning, supporting product roadmaps organized by User and Feature, portfolio planning across products, executive visibility into the forest instead of just trees.\n\nI needed Feature-level boundaries teams could own end-to-end for parallel work. I needed maps that stayed relevant during execution, not just planning. And I needed systematic validation that caught cross-workflow dependencies before development, not during.\n\nBy 2013, this had solidified into strata mapping.\n\n# Returning the Gift\n\nAt the Lean Kanban North America conference in 2013, I again ran into Jeff Patton and sat down for lunch with him.\n\n\"Jeff, why haven't you written a book about story mapping?\" I asked.\n\nHe said, \"Because it's an art, not a process.\"\n\n\"Let me show you my approach to story mapping... how I turned it into a process,\" I replied. I grabbed a napkin and showed him what I'd been developing: an algorithmic approach that made story mapping systematic and repeatable, not dependent on facilitation artistry. A way to turn the insights from his technique into a process that anyone could follow, especially for large, complex projects where you can't rely on a skilled facilitator being in every room.\n\n\"Wow,\" he said.\n\nHe wrote his book the next year.\n\n# Why Process Matters (And It's Not What You Think)\n\nThere's sometimes resistance in agile circles to \"process.\" But process is a tried and true engineering approach for consistency, repeatability, and predictability. This isn't against Agile tenets - it's recognizing that while requirements may be uncertain, consistent elaboration and decomposition approaches reduce ambiguity.\n\nWhen you write code, you follow patterns. You don't reinvent how to structure a class every time. Those patterns are process. They free your mind to focus on the unique problem, not basic mechanics.\n\nStrata mapping provides that same engineering discipline for planning. The process reduces cognitive load by handling the \"how,\" freeing teams to focus on \"what\" and \"why.\" It enables learning because consistent structure makes it easier to spot what's different between projects. It supports collaboration through shared language. And it builds institutional knowledge - new team members learn once, apply everywhere.\n\nThe irony: disciplined process enables more agility, not less. When mechanics are automatic, you respond to change faster.\n\n# Core Philosophy: Understanding Over Plans\n\nScope never changes. Understanding does.\n\nThe scope is \"allow users to log in.\" That never changes. What changes is our understanding that login might mean OAuth, 2FA, SSO, magic links, biometric authentication, or passwordless options.\n\nThis is why planning is more important than plans. We create maps to develop shared understanding. As we learn, we revise our maps continuously. They're living documents, not static blueprints.\n\nTeams I rescued had failed not because scope changed, but because they hadn't created an effective plan that could evolve as knowledge increased. They treated planning as a one-time activity. Plans became increasingly irrelevant while teams devolved into heroics trying to control chaos.\n\nStrata mapping makes planning continuous. The same algorithmic process that creates the map keeps it current during execution.\n\n# The War Room: Making Progress Visible\n\nI spent more than a decade working with product teams to physically create strata maps with sticky notes on big sticky pages during workshops, then moving them to walls reflecting current plans and backlogs. We \"flowed\" Stories and Features across kanban boards, modeling the incrementally emerging product.\n\nAny stakeholder could walk into our war room and see actual progress and implemented functionality. Not a three-month-old plan. The actual current state.\n\nThe power: anything on the \"completed\" side could be demonstrated in the actual product. The map wasn't aspirational. It was operational. It guided teams to successful delivery, gave stakeholders visibility into progress, and established project leadership credibility with executives.\n\nThis taught me something crucial: the map must reflect reality, not wishful thinking. If a Story showed \"done\" but the Feature wasn't demonstrable, something was wrong. The map forced honesty about actual progress.\n\nI'm releasing StrataTree, a SaaS product that virtualizes and digitizes this approach. Tomorrow, it'll include refinement, estimation, management, and forecasting capabilities that make it a virtual War Room, bringing visceral progress visibility to distributed teams anywhere.\n\n# User-First, Not Activity-First\n\nHere's where strata mapping diverges structurally from Patton's approach:\n\n**Patton starts with business activities:** What activities do users perform? What tasks make up those activities? What stories implement those tasks?\n\n**Strata mapping starts with users and benefits:** WHO are we solving for? WHAT benefit do they need? HOW do they get that benefit? (the workflow emerges from this)\n\nWhy does this matter? If you start with activities, you're assuming you know the workflow before you understand the benefit. When rescuing projects, I often found teams had mapped activities, but mapped the WRONG activities because they hadn't started with actual user needs.\n\n# The Fourth Level: Users at the Top\n\nThis leads to the structural difference:\n\n    Patton Story Mapping: Activities → Tasks → Stories (2-3 levels)\n    Strata Mapping: User → Feature → Step → Story (4 levels)\n\nThat User level at the top isn't just organizational. It's what makes everything work:\n\n**Forces focus on WHO:** Every Feature serves a specific User. Every Story traces to a User's need. Prevents solution-first thinking. Enables validation: \"Does this help this User?\"\n\n**Creates boundaries for parallel work:** Team A owns Features for User 1, Team B owns Features for User 2. Clear swim lanes, minimal coordination overhead. Essential for coordinating 5-10 teams on large programs.\n\n**Provides stability as understanding evolves:** Users don't change. Features might split or merge as you learn, but the User anchor prevents scope creep disguised as \"new requirements.\"\n\n    [User 1: Product Manager]    [User 2: Developer]\n              |                             |\n    [Feature A: Manage Backlog]   [Feature B: Track Work]\n              |                             |\n    [Step 1][Step 2][Step 3]      [Step 1][Step 2]\n      |       |       |             |       |\n    Story   Story   Story          Story   Story\n\nThis hierarchy makes the process algorithmic and replicable across teams.\n\n# What's Coming Next\n\nIn a future second post, I'll walk through the six-step algorithm:\n\n1. Identifying Users (algorithmic prioritization)\n2. Identifying Features (benefit-driven)\n3. Designing Workflow with Steps (with \"square map\" validation)\n4. Breaking Down into Stories (context-driven)\n5. Prioritizing and Drawing MMF Lines (the key differentiator)\n6. Cross-Step Dependency Validation (the genius part)\n\nEach step has clear questions, outputs, and validation checks.

For instance, we may have a Product Owner who has the need to manage a backlog, and an Engineering Manager, who might want to assess throughput across her teams (these are just example users/scenarios). The Engineering Manager might also want to be able to view backlogs from ADO/Jira as maps, so they'd use the same functionality as the Product Owner to do so. In this case the Engineering Manager is proxying the Product Owner for purposes of functionality. Similarly we may have an uber-Product Owner (I call this role the Chief Product Owner) for a large project with many teams, with each team having a team-level PO (I call this role the Product Owner delegate), but they'd use the same functionality in a similar manner.\n\nPart of the process of identifying users is to brainstorm all possible users, then group them in clusters based on similar use of the product before distilling the group down to a single user role (User).",

Under a LOC metric that would have counted as negative productivity.\n\nThe fact that they want to track authorship too tells you this isn't about improving anything. It's about blame assignment disguised as performance management. When something breaks they want to know whose name is on the commit.\n\nHere's what actually happens when teams measure LOC: engineers pad code instead of refactoring, nobody wants to delete anything because it looks like negative output, and the codebase bloats until it becomes unmaintainable. You optimize for the metric, not for the product.\n\nThe real question isn't whether you're in trouble. It's whether your leadership understands what engineering productivity actually looks like. And measuring lines of code in 2026 tells you the answer is no.\n\nIf your team is running Scrum but leadership is layering LOC tracking on top, that's not Agile.

Do you agree with them?\n* A specific case, Scrum, provides the role of Scrum Master to support team, remove roadblocks, etc. A SM is deliberately a role with no authority, so as not to undermine the autonomy of the team. \n* A team manager is often a corporate necessity, not a team necessity. \n* Corporate reasons for the existence of a manager often boil down to having one neck to choke. In more sane organizations you also need someone to form budgets, handle HR tasks such as reviews and salaries, oversee hiring decisions, equipment and software purchases, etc.\n* On to your questions:\n   * If a developer is stuck, I would expect them to reach out to the remainder of the team to help them become unstuck. I would expect the other members of the team to stop what they are doing and address the issue. It may not require the entire team, but I expect the team to do something about it. \n   * Does the tech lead step in first? Who cares? Sure. But why not someone else? \n   * Does the engineering manager monitor and intervene? Monitor sure. Intervene? That's trickier. For something as simple as a team member being stuck, I would consider it a failure if a manager needed to get involved. \n   * How do you balance autonomy and accountability? Command and control is not really accoutability. If I'm on a team and I want to get shit done, I hold myself accountable and I hold my teammates accountable. \n* Let's cut the bullshit for a sec. Assuming you're on a half way competent team, what exactly are you expecting the manager to do for you? If the manager is the technical resource you need to unstuck a developer you have a bigger problem than you think. \n* A good Scrum Master, to use as an example, should be working to make themselves unnecessary. In that sense, so should a good engineering manager. \n* There's an old agile model for team maturity: Forming-Storming-Norming-Performing. Interventions by a manager (or SM for that matter) need to be made in the context of where the team is maturity wise and balance the risks of intervening and preventing the team from learning. Sometimes you may have to take the wheel when the team seems intent on driving into a bridge abutment. Or do you? That depends on your context.",

It works in theory with a group of senior engineers who trust each other and have years of shared context.

It sounds like absence disguised as autonomy. There's a massive difference between \"I trust this team to handle it\" and \"I'm too booked to be involved.\" One is leadership. The other is neglect with good branding.\n\nWhat actually works in teams I've seen over 25 years:\n\nThe tech lead handles technical blockers, code quality, and architecture decisions. They're in the code, they know the system, they unblock people because they understand the work. This is day to day.\n\nThe EM handles people, growth, performance, and organizational blockers. They don't need to be in every ceremony. But they need to know what's happening well enough to act when something breaks down. \"Forward performance concerns to me\" is not a performance management strategy. It's outsourcing accountability to the team.\n\nThe \"team swarms\" idea sounds great until you realize that swarming without someone coordinating it is just 4 people context-switching onto a problem that one person with the right knowledge could solve in an hour.\n\nPeer accountability doesn't emerge from a framework. It comes from trust, shared standards, and someone willing to have uncomfortable conversations. If your team isn't there yet, pretending they're self-organizing just delays the problem.",

For any given person, they should have the space to chose how they do their work and some autonomy over what work they do (without the constraints of the org or team). At the same time they are accountable for following org and team rules (follow Definition of Done, take work toward the sprint goal, communicate with team members). \n\nIn a self-organizing team, there is additional autonomy and accountability. The team makes commitments to each other on what work they will get done and how they will collaborate toward the sprint goal. They are given freedom to do that, but then they need to meet their commitments to each other.\n\nIt's worth noting that in Scrum, the team as a whole is eternally accountable for the sprint goal. In mature self-organizing teams, external parties engage with the team and the team sorts out accountability to each other.\n\nI think that gets at the root of your question but you asked about managers. In short, a mature self-organizing team doesn't need one. The teams I've worked with that matured to this point did a lot of different things with their manager depending on what the manager was good at, but almost all moved the manager into a support role.

          "text": "In a mature, self-organizing team, the engineering manager role wouldn't be involved in day-to-day delivery work. This doesn't mean the engineering manager wouldn't be involved if they had a dual role, but engineering management would be a strategic function rather than a tactical one.\n\n1-on-1s are a big part of the role. A key component of this is working with individuals to develop skills and explore career growth opportunities within the organization. When development teams or the broader organization lack skills or people in certain roles, the engineering manager works to fill those gaps by finding people to fill those roles, training people, or bringing in new people with the needed skills. Performance management is another aspect, making sure that people are actively participating and taking managerial steps when they aren't.\n\nThere's also a tools and infrastructure aspect. In my experience, managing the development tools and their costs often falls to the engineering manager. If there are any other considerations, such as qualifying and approving the use of tools on internal systems, that would also be part of the role.\n\nAlthough self-organization is good, the team also needs to serve the business. An engineering manager would be responsible for any guardrails or constraints on the process that the team needs to be aware of, such as compliance requirements.\n\nWith the right structures and temperament, an engineering manager could also function as a coach. Consider LeSS, [which has found that a Scrum Master could serve up to 3 development teams working on a single product](https://less.works/less/framework/scrummaster). My experience suggests that a person can support 4-5 teams if the teams are sufficiently mature and self-organizing at the day-to-day operational level. This pairs well with handling some people-management functions, tools, and process guardrails. However, not everyone has the mindset and approach to primarily sit in coaching, facilitation, and perhaps advising roles.",

          "text": "In any organization, engineering management should be focused on the 'how' more than the 'what,' and also with some aspects of the 'who.'\n\nShould your engineering manager be directly involved with team-level Scrum ceremonies? Certainly, as an observer, at times. Depending on the size of the group, the hands-on engineering manager may be a part of the team (as a Developer and/or Scrum Master, not a manager). Some managers struggle with leaving their manager hat at the door, some are naturally leaders and mentors instead of supervisors and task assigners.\n\nI've been an engineering manager with Scrum teams, where I served primarily as a coach with team level Scrum Masters and Product Owners, fully embracing self-management (the team figures out how to do things and how to allocate the work across the team) while also implementing and enforcing Definition of Done rules, e.g., coding standards, unit test requirements, policies on dealing with bugs, etc. There's a key rule: we manage things, we lead people. As a manager, my job was to create a framework (system) that my teams could effectively function in and succeed, and then to help them effectively utilize that system with advice and impediment resolution support when issues couldn't be handled by them. I think this is a good spot for a first level manager.\n\nConcerning involvement with team iteration events, with the exception of the retrospective all meetings are open to everyone in the interest of transparency, yet only team members can actively engage. In my role as coach and facilitator (not driver) I did attend most daily Scrums and all of the other events. Again, this requires that the manager remember that mentoring and coaching is much more powerful and effective than dictating process and outcomes. Some people can do it, some can be mentored and coached to do it, some people cannot do it.\n\nTo the OP: your manager seems to be very hands-off, which is good (doesn't unnecessarily interfere with the team) and bad (the team seems to be looking for leadership and mentoring and isn't getting it).

Engineers live in Jira, stakeholders live in Slack, and I'm stuck translating between them.\n\nTypical flow: Customer issue comes up in Slack. Discuss it with stakeholders. Everyone agrees it's priority. I go create Jira ticket, trying to capture all the Slack context in the description. Engineer picks up ticket, has questions, asks in Jira comments. I go back to Slack to clarify with stakeholders. Back to Jira with answer. Ticket gets implemented but slightly off because some nuance from Slack discussion didn't make it to Jira.\n\nThe context loss is real. Jira ticket says \"improve dashboard performance\" but the Slack thread has the actual customer pain story that makes it clear which performance issue matters. Engineer optimizes the wrong thing because they're working from the Jira description not the full context.\n\nTried linking Slack threads in Jira but nobody clicks links. Tried having engineers join Slack discussions but they (reasonably) don't want to monitor Slack for context they need to do their jobs.\n\nFeels like there should be a way to have product discussions in Slack close to customers and stakeholders while engineers work in Jira, but right now that boundary creates constant friction and information loss.",

Leave the conversations where they naturally are - non-tech in Slack (they won’t likely use Jira comments, or use them well they’ll just add confusion - the non-tech discussion usually includes much scope creep, other possibilities, totally extraneous comments, and is distracting to the engineer).  Link to the Slack conversation, but don’t RELY on that link.  The ticket itself should be self-contained with all of the agreed-upon-by-the-stakeholder goals, a proper Definition of Done.  Concise, clear, and a good target for the engineer.  \n\nWhat’s needed is some official direction IN THE TICKET to review the Slack conversation at the start of work.  This will give the engineer that context, and work out what’s distracting and what’s useful.  It also captures any truly IMPORTANT nuances on the conversation that may affect the definition of done, or the estimate, or the scope.   That conversation, though distracting, is often important this way.  Beyond this, the engineer is to follow what the ticket says.  The Slack convo is just a resource feeding that, it itself is not authoritative.  Be sure everyone understands this - if it’s not in DoD it’s not enough that it’s in the convo.  And, give them pathways to get it into the DoD. Also - the Slack convo is often very good for designing the QA tests, but again - it is not the system of record for those tests. \n\nWith the stakeholders, be clear about this.  They need to agree the Definition of Done, and agree that the slack is not authoritative, especially after work starts.  Should something vital come up, they need to sound a bigger alarm and not just add to the convo.  Standups, sprint planing meetings, etc. - these are the times to nail down the DoD. \n\nFinally, YOU need to keep up on the conversations and make sure all of this is being followed, that the information is flowing where it needs to go.  Ultimately good habits will be built, and there will be clarity all round.   Bells will sound, angels will sing, the sun will shine brightly…\n\nTLDR - organize your process around the ticket being the ironclad authoritative system of record, and get everyone focused and clear on that.",

That means you can use valuable working software as a probe to uncover the actual needs of users, because if you are wrong, it's not expensive, hard, slow or risky to change it.\n\n**2.  Theory-X management need not apply.**  High performance comes from unlocking intrinsic motivation of teams - broadly that means STOPPING the things that demotivate them or mean they are disengaged as a start point.  You need to lead, not manage.\n\n**The key shift in thinking is away from scope, budget and time.**\n\nEach Sprint/Iteration is a small project, where you create (and measure) benefits created so far, and check the assumptions made when you started.  You can extend scope, pivot to a new direction, or decide to end now and give the team a more valuable project to work on, based on what you now know.\n\nIn that sense scope, budget and time are all flexible, and you opt to invest one Sprint at a time, and review what to do next with all of the stakeholders.   The goal is not efficient delivery, but enabling \"off ramps\" from the programme  that have zero cost, every few weeks.\n\nAgile methods were called \"lightweight\" for this reason.",

Instead of estimating how long something takes and being wrong, leadership decides how much time something is worth.

              "text": "I've had tremendous experience with Scrum and Kanban, and have read the book on Shape Up. I think the contrast between Scrum and Shape Up is really a contrast in how many people (incorrectly) implement Scrum.\n\nA team is going to produce as much as it can over a fixed duration using a specific process/approach, regardless of their specific process. Shape Up says that these 6-week commitments will be made 'as a matter of honor.' I don't buy that. What I don't like about Shape Up is, I won't know how the teams are doing against the plan until the 6 weeks are up; with Scrum and running two week sprints, I know in 2 weeks whether we're ahead, on, or behind our predicted schedule. Not so I can beat the team up, but so I can update forecasts, adjust planning, etc. \n\nIn real life, much of the functionality we want to build for a new product, or a new release, is necessary, so how much time it's worth is irrelevant... if you need it you need it regardless of how much time it takes. Getting it done, quickly and efficiently is what matters. What happens if the leadership decided that something is worth 6 weeks, the teams spend 6 weeks working on it, and it's not done? If it's truly worth it, you spend another 6 weeks! Really, this 'how much time' question is about setting priorities, not scope.\n\nWhen people mention the unnecessary overhead of Scrum, I shake my head. Scrum done properly, running 2-week sprints, has about 4 hours over an 80-hour work period... about 5% of overall time. If done correctly, this doesn't even take away actual working time. Most people come into the office (or start work) by grabbing a cup of coffee, checking their email, maybe a quick chat with coworkers... and then they start their work period. Have your daily Scrum 15 minutes after the beginning of work hours and get it over quickly... 10 to 15 minutes MAX... and then people can come to work, grab a coffee, quickly check their email, and go to the meeting, and be heads down and working a half hour after the start of the day. If that little bit of overhead destroys your productivity... well, I don't believe it.\n\nIs Shape Up better than dysfunctional Scrum. Surely. But, why not follow a functional optimal Scrum process instead?",

Most of the challenges I’ve seen have come from lack of trust during the execution phase, or misalignment from the planning phase. \n\nMy (biased) opinion is that shape up is hugely beneficial to almost any midsized org with a mature software product. The cycle times alone become a real challenge if you’re doing a greenfields project so you need to be at a stage where a 4-6 week cycle feels about right to deliver an impactful piece of work. \n\nShape Up will usually fail at places with low trust, or a large number of junior employees. By nature, you’re leaving people alone to do their work for long periods of time, so if the requisite cultural pieces aren’t there then you’ll have major challenges. \n\nI’m happy to ramble about shape up for days.

Setting time-based SLAs like \"complete all reviews within 24 hours\" apparently just leads to surface-level reviews where people approve things without understanding them because they're under pressure, which defeats the purpose. Different engineers having different standards for acceptable code makes it inconsistent too, some people are sticklers about test coverage and docs while others are more pragmatic about shipping working code even if imperfect. Are there approaches that actually square this circle or if it's just accepting that you either move slower or ship more bugs and pick which poison you prefer?\n\n",

          "text": "Before discussing reducing time, have you defined why you are conducting a code review? There are several reasons: finding defects, developing a shared understanding of a system's design and implementation, identifying enhancements and opportunities to improve an otherwise working system, and exposing implementation details to testers to move from black-box to white-box testing, just to name a few. Code review, and even different types of code reviews, are better at some of these than others.\n\nOnce you know why you're reviewing the code, do you know how long you're actually spending compared to the value you get from that time? If your purpose is to find defects, how many defects are you finding? If your purpose is to develop a shared understanding, are the people who didn't implement that feature comfortable enhancing that feature in the future? Sometimes, value could be hard to quantify, depending on the reason for review.\n\nGenerally speaking, are you focusing on things that need human eyes during code review? Regardless of when or why you conduct code reviews, automate as much as possible. People shouldn't be looking for style problems. Use a linter and automate code formatting and flag anything that can't be automated before the review starts. Expose code coverage, test results, and static analysis to make sure that there is some confidence that the code is tested and does what it is supposed to do without introducing errors. Tool output can also be provided to the reviewers. Sometimes, I've gotten more value from reviewing a description of the proposed change, a test coverage report, and automated unit and integration test cases to identify missing edge cases than from reading the actual implementation code.",

A 900-line PR cannot be reviewed in 15 minutes, it can only be approved in 15 minutes. Those aren't the same thing.\n\nThe teams I've seen that cracked this had one rule: nothing over 200 lines gets merged without being split first. Painful to enforce for the first month, then it becomes the fastest thing you do because reviewers actually understand what they're looking at.\n\nThe other thing that helps is separating what the review is for. Architectural decisions should not be made during code review, that's too late, the code is already written. If the approach is wrong at that stage you're not reviewing, you're rewriting. Architecture gets discussed before a line is written. Review is for implementation quality only, and that's a much faster conversation.\n\nThe SLA thing is a symptom of the real problem which is that reviewers have no ownership of what they're reviewing. If I'm assigned 12 random PRs this week I'll rubber-stamp them to close the queue, anyone would. If I own the feature and I'm reviewing the implementation, I have a reason to actually read it.\n\nNone of this is a tradeoff, it's just structure. The tradeoff framing usually means the process is wrong, not that the work is fundamentally hard.",

Continuous deployment means just that.  XP has an onsite customer, embedded with a team, co-creating. Scrum suggests you aim at multiple increments released in a Sprint, to get feedback on the Sprint Goal.   \n  \nIn general that's my starting point - do we tick those three boxes?  \nOr, can we get there. \n\nIf not, then you are in that contractual, avoid-being-the-scapegoat space.  \nWhich means slow, bloated bureaucratic waste, so everyone feels safer.",

          "text": "Lean is not a methodology, it's a collection of heuristics and practices that can be used within any framework. Agile is also not a methodology, it's a way of thinking expressed in principles that emphasizes improving the ability to respond effectively to change. Most people who say they're \"doing Agile\" are actually using some form of Scrum (that may be more or less faithful to the Scrum Guide).\n\nSAFe (Essential SAFe, the first level of the framework and the one that is most-implemented) is a framework that sits on top of the teams and is meant for large multi-team projects. SAFe has its own training for Scrum and Kanban... go to Scrum Alliance, [Scrum.org](http://Scrum.org), or [Scrum.Inc](http://Scrum.Inc), or Kanban University for training in Scrum or Kanban. Although I've had several engagements where I helped organizations struggling with SAFe (I have my own approach to fixing SAFe I call SAFeR), I'm not a SAFe fan. There are better ways to scale... more lightweight, more effective. My own approach, developed in the early 2010s, focuses on a Product Owner Council with a Chief Product Owner, and has a Chief Scrum Master with team-level Scrum Masters. We run two levels of refinement: project/release refinement and team-level refinement. We hold daily Scrums, with the last Scrum being a leadership Scrum (all POs, all Scrum Masters, plus functional leads and managers, facilitated by the Chief Scrum Master) which runs like a Kanban standup. This approach has worked well for me in many organizations and has resulted in significant quality and throughput increases, as well as increased team morale.\n\nXP has mostly been absorbed into Scrum by having its key practices integrated by teams into their Scrum implementations... pair programming, TDD, CI, refactoring, collective code ownership, etc. That makes sense when you realize that Scrum is a team-level project management process wrapper while XP practices are good engineering practices for software development.\n\nKanban (the Kanban Method) is a collection of of practices and techniques based on principles from many different approaches, primarily Lean/TPS and Theory of Constraints, along with some original work on product management, leadership, and metrics. The Kanban Method is orthogonal to Agile frameworks and can be used within, alongside, and above these frameworks. My scaling approach has a lot of Kanban baked in as the glue that aligns and coordinates teams.\n\n  \nRe jargon, you only see jargon among the Agile geeks. I will say that the difference between failing Scrum adoptions at the beginning of my engagements and successful Scrum at the end is the faithful application of practices based on principles and the insistence on facing and fixing problems.\n\n",
