      "text": "The current state of the Agile market - based on conversations I’ve had with hiring managers at Fortune 100 companies.\n\n**Q: Do you need people to implement agile ways of working?**\n\nA: No. We’ve spent the last few years investing in our transformations. Now we just need people to focus on delivering the work.\n\n**Q: What would you like Scrum Masters to focus on?**\n\nA: Helping to put together delivery plans, facilitating the ceremonies, and making sure the work gets delivered on time.\n\n**Q: Is there scope to transform ways of working beyond team level?**\n\nA: No. We already have a framework in place and expect people to work within it. Any change can impact programme-level metrics and be disruptive.\n\n**My take:**\n\n**You can complain on principle that the role is no longer transformation-led. But if that stance doesn’t bring food to the table - and companies clearly don’t want it - what’s the point? You are just spreading misinformation and killing people’s livelihoods.**\n\n**Agile Coaches had the opportunity to coach this properly while leading transformations. Frankly, many messed it up. After all these years, if organisations still don’t understand the Scrum Master role, that failure sits with the people who were meant to teach it and ensure it was implemented correctly.**\n\n**You can’t spend a decade leading transformations, fail to translate the value in business terms, and then be surprised when leadership reverts to delivery-first roles.**",

          "text": "My feelings:\n\n* Agile is basically dead. Oh, there will always be pools of high performing agile organizations that \"get it\". But as a large scale movement? It's dead, Jim.\n* Most organizations have successfully resisted changing to become more agile. If they're lucky, they have pockets of agility encompassing a product, or a team, but the overall impact is probably minor.\n* As you say, most agile coaches/champions failed to convince stakeholders of the benefits of changing, or, if they did, managed to carry through the changes. Whether or not that is the fault of the coaches or if they were mostly doomed from the start, I'm not equipped to judge.\n* I can't simply point to failures at the management level. If you look at the kinds of posts seen here in this sub, and others, it's tragic. Endless arguments over story points. Definitions of Ready and other \"agilified\" phase gates. Cargo cult approaches to methods. Scrum Masters who are essentially meeting schedulers. Complete lack of any sort of organizational feedback loop with actual change.\n* The rank and file of our industry largely rejected adopting agile as well.\n* We never drove the idea that software could be managed like a factory production line out of the industry and, given the current economic trends, it might actually be even more entrenched now. I'm still having arguments about basic ideas like slack in plans that I had two decades ago.\n* I'll always wonder if Beck & co had productized XP in the same way Scrum was productized. Could it have won the agile wars? Probably not. In my experience, most developers talk a good game about professionalism, but don't really want to put in the effort.",

          "text": "Yeah, agreed with some specifications: the industry of Agile Transformation is slowing down (call it dead if you want to, idc) but Agile as an approach is becoming the current standard- hear me out:\n\nBefore Agile, software delivery was molded after manufacturing projects of the time, where start to delivery was 2-3 YEARS. Big huge investigative plan, ruminating internally to identify ALL the details, the pitfalls, exactly when who would be doing what. THEN execute the plan for 2-3 years and SEE if you could sell the product or if your users liked the new version (think Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000... bulk build, release). \n\nNow, while there are still orgs who build software this way, most (granted limited sample size) are building much more Agile delivering multiple times a year, if not month. There is more receptivity to the ideas in the Agile Manifesto, there is more alignment with the Agile principles (regardless of if they are referenced).\n\nAgile mindset is a competitive advantage.\n\nIf you want to talk about frameworks of Agile (Scrum, Kanban, XP) sure these are not doing well (if even used correctly) and as you mentioned thousands of SM were \"paraded around\" to signal that a company was using Scum without going through the challenge that is a transformation (put makeup on a pig). I don't personally blame the Scrum Masters- they were dropped in a chaotic situation, but that is a rant for another time. But yes, there is a significant decrease in the opportunity for a \"Scrum transformation\" (maybe the same, just fewer orgs dressing up to \"play Scrum\" since it is no longer the fad).\n\nThere is still opportunity for organizational and department and team transformation- but as you made note of, it's not the ONLY accountability orgs are looking for from the SM or Agile Coach role. Some of that is moving to management, some orgs are asking for facilitation, delivery scheduler, and transformation. Just not enough appetite for it to be a full time role (and, c'mon look at the industry track record for \"transformation\")",

The product was exciting everyone who saw it and interacted with it. Honestly,  it looked like an inevitable success.  Then there was a blitzkreig of office politics where the protagonists turned into millipedes with a fetish for shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nI feel that roles such as product manager and scrum master,  whatever they were intended to be, turned into gate keepers to prevent useful communication and teamwork. \n\nBusinesses cherry picked what they wanted to hear out if the agile manifesto.

Most \"agile training\" focusses on processes and tools, rather than the core leadership and (Extreme Programming / DevOps) skills needed\n\n\\- **there's a huge \"legacy codebase\"**; legacy in the Michael Feathers sense that we cannot make changes cheaply, easily, quickly and safely (no new defects) because of a combination of over-complexity, poor design and ineffective test automation.  \n\n\\- **the cloud is expensive***;*  agile practices are based on \"run it and see, then refactor\";  when you are on-prem with low cost hardware (or hardware that has been capitilised) that's one thing.  When you are running on a cloud where every byte and cycle costs, that's something else.  We used \"measure twice, cut once\" back in the mainframe days as well. \n\nAgility has much in common with \"lean\", and \"lean\" initiatives also tended to fail where it wasn't seen to be an exercise in continuously evolving the organisation towards better and better performance, over the long term.  \n  \nVery, few people in management roles are interested in the long term;  quick-wins to bolster the resume so they can move on in 3-5 years - or gain some short term bonus - tends to be the norm.",

Very few have figured out the right way to manage this, but agile principles still are the guidepost we can use to figure it out. \n\nThink about it this way...  Almost all of the practices we employ today are about managing the reality that writing the code is on the critical path. What happens when writing the code takes minutes? What is the point of the vast majority of our practices in that kind of world?  Why do I even need story pointing any more, for example? Requirements gathering, rapid iteration, feedback loops, etc. become critical in this kind of world. Out of vogue practices like RAD and XP have things and ideas we can use to build a new model, and we'll probably need to invent whole new ways of constructing software. Non-developers who feed requirements are going to have to do things very differently to keep up. They should now be a primary focus of this community.  \n\nThe near future of dev is radically changed. Agile practitioners who try to impose old methodologies on the new reality will be left behind.

Better agile does NOT lead to higher profits, more revenue, market share, etc. because CUSTOMERS DO NOT CARE.\n\n3. There is an anti-establishment thread that developers know best and other roles in an organization need to limit participation to outside of scrum. That was never sustainable and even more so now with offshore outsourcing and AI. I get tired of developers saying we do agile wrong and point to the latest framework, which is as common as the latest JavaScript framework.\n\n\n\nProduct (Operating) Model “enhanced” by AI is probably the replacement.\n\nI have done this for 20+ years in software, marketing, manufacturing and consulting. I still have an agile role, but the % of my time being a scrum master goes down every year. If you are a scrum master then you need to have a career pivot or exit planned.",

If you're planning to put an order for a monthly build of 10.000 units (or even a one-shot order), the EMS and procurement  needs to know weeks, maybe even months ahead, when the manufacturing documents are ready, and when delivery are to start. \n\nBut none of the methods - not even scrum@scale or SAFe - are able to combine the path growing FROM a small team TO a world-wide enterprise. They break down once the company needs to face the facts: They can't do every project they want, because the money is limited. \n\nIf you plan on launching a major change to coincidence with Halloween, and another project is working on the black Friday project and the third is working on the holiday season clearence, and a fourth one deals with new regulations, those projects must start planning the work way ahead in order to not step on each other's toes the month before launch. \n\nOr, those methods (especially SAFe) provide way too much overhead for a small company to manage.\n\nOne of the things I think agile fail to address, is that on a higher level, product management needs to know at certain project gates if they are going to take the next step in the project or kill it completely. The latter doesn't meen running rm -rf /src, but even if they realize halfway through a €500 M project they are on the wrong path, making any meaningful change on the project goal level still means the project goes back to square one since that inevitably means a non-trivial change of requirements, priorities, team interdpendencies or even dependencies on deliverables that other projects expects this project to deliver.\n\nWith any decently sized project (even if we're only talking about €5 M in size), there's inevitably going to be a lot of teams involved, and neither developers, scrum masters or even individual teams' product owners might be the ones in direct contact with customers. Delivery of a feature that a customer actually see, might involve several teams' workpackages, developed over a period of sprints.\n\nNot to mention the fact, people come and go in the teams and projects. People that would be perfect to allocate for a specific project might not be available because they are currently busy working with another project, so the team's actual knowledge might be limited.\n\nFrom my experience as PO - and software development in general for the last 25+ years - I do believe scrum works, and it works well on a team level.",

In reality, I see a recurring pattern: teams feel forced to agree to dates suggested by managers, or they provide dates based on their own narrow context without seeing the 'big picture' of the company strategy.\n\nThe result? Managers spend half their lives in planning meetings, yet dates are still missed and everyone is pulling all-nighters at the end of the sprint anyway. It feels like the responsibility is in a 'no-man's land.'\n\nI'm curious about your experience. Should we be pushing harder for teams to own the planning? Or is it time to admit that Product Owners/Managers should handle the 'when' while we handle the 'how'? Assuming teams still provide the high-level estimates and the technical input to make informed decisions. \n\nWould love some honest perspectives on this.",

Lots of very informed opinions here. \n\nA lot of devs I have worked with in the past somehow drew the conclusion that estimated dates aren’t part of Agile. I’m not sure where this fallacy comes from. \n\nI like to use this analogy. Let’s say you are knocking down your house to build a new one. You need to rent somewhere, you need to maybe store furniture and belongings somewhere. There may be extra costs with regards to traveling to work and kids to school. It’s not unreasonable to ask your builder for a ball park estimate. And as you get closer to that estimate the builder should be able to confidently give a better timeframe. \n\nThe expectation that businesses who are paying for this development don’t have the right to ask for estimates seems unreal to me. People wouldn’t expect it from a builder but then turn around and ask the business to not ask. They may also have other financial knock on decisions to make just like you having pay an extra month of rent because the build isn’t finished. \n\nNow of course, how these are communicated, treated and actioned by the business is the core problem. \n\nThey should really treat it like a really long airline flight. A plane leaves London for Sydney. Journey should take 22 hours. So an estimated arrival time is given. As the plane hits various points in the journey all kinds of unforeseen events can occur that may affect the timeline. But once the plane hits Asia, then the west coast of Australia, the pilots can more confidently convey an arrival time.

Kanban is just chaos displayed as post-it's on a whiteboard) is good for mature, autonomous teams all working with one single project and an active PO.\n\nWe all know, that's the academic simplification of a reality that doesnt look like that at all, especially if the features requested are more complex than just adjusting the color of a button or piping data as-is from the database to the UI.\n\nAs PO, I can ask for the /time/ a certain story will take, but I also need to give the team the prerequisites for success; as clear requirements /as reasonable/, sufficient priority in the backlog, as few dependencies on other teams as possible, and a reasonable chance of estimating the work (IMHO, it's better to ask for estimates of a small set of tasks ever other morning, instead of dumping a full backlog on sprint start day). Given that, it's possible to make an assessment on the likelyhood of a delivery by date X, assuming the tasks have the right priorities in the backlog. \n\nAnd by the way. Dump the sprints. Instead, work in iterations, with a steady cadence. Do the math: unless all stories at the bottom of the sprint backlog are 1 calendardays worth of work including review and test, they will either spill onto the next sprint, or there will be devs idling waiting for new stories during the last day(s) of the sprint.\n\nBut we can't get rid of the fact that other parts of the organization are actually dependent on knowing /when/ the feature is going to be delivered, bug-free and closed; marketing needs to plan PR events, operations/manufacturing needs to plan roll-out, support and sales needs training etc. \n\nAnd upper management needs to know when the resources can be made available for new projects, which will affect the decisions of which projects to start and which to ditch.\n\nAt the same time, doing V model style requirements, architecture, design, implementation etc as a glorified waterfall process, doesn't work either unless the drawbacks are accepted: nothing can be delivered until all documents have been signed off; bugs won't be found until way into the execution; bugs in design, architecture or requirements won't surface until near the end of the project. \n\nI've been pondering about a model that bridge the agile low-overhead of small teams to the predictably needed by large organizations.

None.\n\nHere's why: yes, delivery time is affected by scope and quality expectations - the classic trade-offs. But what actually dominates? **The system your team works in** \\- pushing more work in progress, the dependencies, the interruptions, the unclear requirements, the bottlenecks, the context switching.\n\nAnd who shapes that system? Largely the same people setting the dates.\n\nSo when dates slip, the team gets blamed for \"bad estimates\" - but they were never in control of the variables that actually determine delivery time. It's a setup for failure.\n\n  \n**So what's the alternative? Measure your predictability and Improve on it**\n\nReal example: A team's 3-point stories take anywhere from **0.3 days to 3.6 days**. Same estimate, 10x difference in delivery time.\n\nWhen you break it down by work type, **bugs account for 33% of the total variation** \\- twice as unpredictable as stories.\n\nNow you have something actionable: audit how bugs are defined, standardize the workflow, or estimate them separately.\n\nFix the system, and estimates become reliable.

The danger zone is when items have been started, have cost effort, have created potential bugs, but haven't yet been tested or given to a customer. You want to avoid getting too much work into this \"in progress\" state, by finishing the fk out of it. \n\nIn my work boards I colour the sprint backlog or \"selected\" column as yellow alert, and in-progress as red.

Then, when someone goes to add clouds, they discuss it more, and realize that clouds are a stupid application of resources.\n\nThe key is that people will chase that which gets the biggest reward. Jira seems to be a good way to do this, but I personally think it is a terrible terrible terrible way to directly manage a project. All it does is set in stone, those \"let's add cloud\" issues; but now you have that accountability; but wasted accountability.\n\nThe problem is that accountability has now entirely replaced any autonomy. Jira is \"let's work together as a team as long as you obey your manager.\"\n\nThe developers then become jira ticket closing fools.\n\nKanban is somewhat better, and can work with Jira, but an Eisenhower matrix is the ideal. It technically can be combined with Jira; and that way you can see if people are closing the most urgent and important tickets, this way \"bug which is really annoying key client\" gets priority over \"let's add pretty clouds.\"\n\nOnce you replace autonomy with accountability, you, as a horrific micromanager, need to have the ability to make all the decisions, as once micromanagement kicks in, your team will mentally check out. You will have thrown out a massive amount of their ability to self regulate.\n\nThis is the difference between leadership and mangement. Management is always micromanagement. It only works when there is a process, like a factory; you need to make sure the hoppers are topped up, the machines are oiled, the forklift safety classes are passed.\n\nLeadership, is where you oversee a group of creative smart, driven people, and help them toward realizing a vision.\n\nThe moment a person says, \"Herding cats\" you have a micromanaging fool. A leader holds out a treat, the cats follow, as long as the leader isn't trying to get the cats to go somewhere stupid; as they are smart enough to not go there.\n\nBut, jira tickets can be, \"Sleep in the middle of a superhighway\" and some poor schlub will try to close that ticket.",

They have this weird idea that if they give the devs the whole picture it will \"distract them\".\n\nThe reality is that partial information is where distractions come from. They will be told, clouds, oceans, and tables (rows cols).\n\nSo, they don't entirely know which one to prioritize. Except the big picture is that it is going to be accounting software used by accountants. Now they know how to prioritize.\n\nThe simple reality is that most managers got there through the peter principle. Thus, are the least equipped to make decisions; yet proceed to take away all the information and authority from those best equipped.\n\nThe simple failing of most managers is the understanding that you can't delegate responsibility, without also delegating authority. Yelling at drones because they didn't close enough tickets, or the correct tickets is the road to higher turnover, and even less independent thought.\n\nBad managers result in bad employees.",

There are valid reasons to abandon development of a feature.\n\n  \nAnother alternative is that they tried to deliver the feature, but they found an abstacle or a bloker. Some skill they miss, some information they lack, some permission they don't have, they need some feedback from the actual end-user but they don't have it.

When the work isn't done, 99% of the time it's not due to malice or laziness, but because of some blocker. Sometimes that blocker is just misalignment of people in a team, maybe a person is forced to work with a tool they don't like (e.g. if an expert 15 years developer knows linux very well and now is forced to work on windows, he's not going to be happy, believe me). \n\nSo build the trust with the team, find out what blocks a particular person and remove that blocker.",

Individually, we have to accomplish X number of SP, but they don’t allow us to go over a certain total number of SP in a sprint.

Developers defensive start sandbagging, pointing stories higher and higher, to reduce change of carryover and to stay above point quota.\n\n2. Developers start demanding PO’s and stakeholders extensively document requirements, so no last minute edge cases or tweaks hold up the system. Developers try to get as much in writing as possible, which can be used against PO’s and stakeholders later on if they say a piece of work doesn’t meet agile’s Definition of Done and the developer’s sprint is getting threatened.\n\n\n\nThis sometimes cause civil War on the team as the PO‘s and scrum master and stakeholders start, pulling out their copy of agile manifesto and start citing it, and claiming that they don’t have to provide all the details and requirements, because agile. And the PO and stakeholders start comparing working with developers to using a monkey’s paw.\n\n3. Malicious compliance on developers’ part tends to go up.\n\n4. Nobody wants to write tests, especially if the tests are retroactively for code that was written much earlier before the codebase ever had tests.\n\n5. Developers end up jockeying for the easy plum stories that have a little risk; they will actively avoid complex stories that potentially require lots of innovation, as the risk of sprint carryover can be pretty high for those. The people who tend to end up getting the complex or innovative stories tend to get pipped more as they have more sprint carryovers.\n\n6. PO’s, managers, and stakeholders end up being present in planning poker meetings and try to negotiate down the number of story points devs assign to stories. In some cases the PO, manager, stakeholder etc will not like the final points and ask the developers to repoint all the stories again until they get story pointings they like. This is usually done to extract more work out of developers at the expense of their work life balance; as well as gaslight developers who say the amount of work scheduled for the sprint isn’t possible.\n\nIf there is then sprint carryover even after points are negotiated down and devs miss kids’ birthday parties and funerals, management can them come back with “the number of points was average for our sprint; what happened guys?”",

We just do some readjustments depending on whether a dev joins/leaves the team. \n\nWith that, we can give some sort of estimates to the product people which makes them happy. At the same time, because we know our capacities and deadlines, we devs our sort of satisfied as well.\n\nBasically, how it relates to the OG post is that the amount of story points we finished was set AFTER doing some \"calibrations\" throughout lots of sprints.

My slack, meeting notes, customer calls, eng asking clarifying questions I should've answered upfront.\n\nIs everyone still doing this manually or have people found AI tools that actually help here? Not talking about \"summarize this doc.\" I mean something that can pull from multiple sources, get me most of the way to a good ticket, and push it to Jira without me copy-pasting fields one by one.\n\nTried using ChatGPT but all the copy / paste makes it pretty impractical. At a certain point its fast just to write it myself\n\nEdit: Thanks for the feedback. I actually ended up finding a tool that a friend recommended and it seems pretty useful. Its called Telos and pretty much does what I was describing (https://www.telos-ai.org/)",

If the same thing keeps happening week after a week after a week sprint after sprint, this should be documented and buy about the third sprint when the same shit rolls around you forced them to deal with it. Yes I said force. People don’t always like fixing things when it’s hard. But if they don’t fix things, they never get better. That’s called leadership.\n\nIf they don’t like this approach next retrospective said there like a bump on a log. When they ask, why are you sitting there, explain to them the situation you want to make things better you’ve documented things that are not going well and no one else wants to.

Put these actions into the inner rectangle (near the outer sticky they are addressing).\n\nYou can probably find other exercises to try over at retromat, too.

Pointless and dumb.  Talk about the issue at the time, and if you agree to park it until the retro, add it to your retro board as a reminder.  \n\nUSE A WHITE BOARD - every single retro tool I have seen falls into the same trap of being \"snapshot\" focussed;  an enduring whiteboard (real or virtual) lets you track your progress, detail your working agreements, and provides a focal point for framing the start of the retrospective\n\nPOSITIVE FRAMING - always express things in terms of \"what could go better\", in a good-faith way.  There's some solid psychology and neuroscience around why this will tend to drive the team towards finding creative solutions rather than falling into the \"victim, villain, hero\" drama triangle and blame game\n\nDON'T RACE TO SOLUTIONS- it's much better to use the retro time to really dig down and get to a solid \"problem statement\" than it is to try and use the short time you have to \"solve\" things;  it's okay to set things up for a later workshop using \"Ishikawa Fishbone\", \"Evaporating Clouds\" or a bit of a \"systems thinking archetype\" approach to addressing an issue. \n\nMEASURE STUFF - when you agree to a change how you work, remember it's an experiment.  Change without data to support the value of that change is just dogma.  What are you measuring, and for how long?  And remember Goodhart's Law - you are using data to confirm improvements, not to set targets.",

          "text": ">  Has anyone found a way to make these more grounded in reality? \n\nHere are some tips that could help\n\n1) BRING THE DATA\n\nYou should start the retro looking at objective data that measured what happened during your iteration or sprint. What did you commit to? What did you ship? Did you achieve your goal or goals? Bring the core data you as a team use to measure your success as a team.\n\nIf you don't have this data then start by discussing how you do want to measure success and what metrics you will use to do so.\n\n2) FOCUS ON OUTCOME\n\nThe point of the retro should be to change something. Rants about what went wrong are not very productive unless you are going to make some change to the process that improves it. That is why a lot of frameworks for prompting conversations are focused around things like 'Things to keep vs things to change'.\n\nTry and get the team to frame their discussion items in terms of not what went wrong but what you are going to do different next iteration. If this becomes difficult or people still fall into rant mode, make this very explicate, the prompt for discussion should be what should we do differently next iteration and why.\n\n3) TAKE SMALL BITES\n\nIt can be tempting in a retro to try and boil the ocean. Everyone dumps a million complaints and then it can feel like big sweeping change is needed. Oh my god look at everything that is going wrong. You create a ton of follow up tasks and then nothing gets done.\n\nInstead, focus on the most serious issue from the previous iteration and implement one change that should improve it in the next iteration.\n\nIf people worry that you are losing all the valuable rants from the retro assure them not to worry, if a problem is really a problem _it will come up again_ over and over and that will be a signal to fix it in a future retro.\n\nWhat can work well is that everyone writes down an issue on a sticky and then you all vote, and you tackle only the issue with the highest votes as it indicates that is affecting the most people.\n\n4) MEASURE SUCCESS\n\nFrame the change you are going to make not simply as something new the team will do but also frame it as what you _expect_ to be different when you do it. Then measure that and bring that data into the next retro. You changed how you communicate that a Pull Request is waiting to be reviewed, did you see faster PR approval? No? So that seems like it is still a pressing concern that you should tackle, rather than just move on to the next issue.\n\nHope this helps.",

This team includes 1 PM, 1 Team Lead, 8 devs, and 2 automated QA.\n\nMy central issue is that the team is I’ll not meaningfully self govern and I have to constantly push to keep things moving.  Common issues include:\n\n1. Team does not report when stuck or things are complicated.  They stop work.  I have to check in with everyone twice a day proactively to ensure they are not blocked.\n\n2. No testing of any kind.  Automated testing does not show me frameworks or plans, and only clicks on buttons at my specific request.  I can’t even give them a list of features to manually test…I must remind them (often multiple times) to get them to test prior to deployment.  This also means that every fix just introduces more bugs, which only I catch when doing E2E testing EVERY night.\n\n3. Team will not split up items or ask questions.  I have to assign every story, and perfect waterfall requirements (which anticipate every question) must be provided or devs will not start work.\n\n4. No help ideating.  Nobody has ever contributed an idea, any input on prioritizing, or any thoughts about relative lift for items.  I just get silence every time I ask.\n\nHonestly, this only scratches the surface.  Nothing is ever moving, and I have to put in Herculean effort to complete every task.  Doing all of the above only accounts for about 25% of my current workload, as I own every facet of the product (customer success, sales, marketing, roadmapping, research, etc).\n\nI am under heavy fire from the executive team as they are unhappy with pace of progress.  They say I need to 5x development speed within 2 months or I will be fired.  \n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation?  Any advice about what I can do here?",

I spare you the talk about \"leading the dev team should not be your job\" (I bet you're aware of that, as much as I am aware that sometimes it happens to be as in your case).\n\nI am somewhat in a similar situation (also PM with a team with no real engineering lead). But still, we have \"Lead Engineers\", 7 devs, 1 UX, 1 PO (me) (and one virtually non-functioning scrum master who I guess mentally quit already, at least in this position - though, strangely he keeps clinging to it, but that is another story).\n\nWhat I want to say is this: I also don't have perfect circumstances by the books and still we somehow managed to instill some ownership into the team - not as much as I would have wanted sometimes, but still. \n\nA part of it comes down to the individuals, but a lot comes by leadership - also the product owner: If you \\_show\\_ the people, that you'll be their garbage can and jump in on everything, that should not be your job, they'll get used to it and never step up.\n\nUltimately, development effort demands \\_ownership\\_ of people over issues and artefacts and processes and stuff. For most things, there needs to be someone who \\_cares\\_, who takes it on them to move some thing further: and that someone cannot be you in every instance. It's not only not healthy and unsustainable, it also will not bring the change you - and your bosses - desire: 5x'ing output cannot come from you whipping people into obedience.\n\nThat is maybe not the answer you're looking for - but what I would do is this: map out the process of development and mark down, where there should be someone (not putting names, no blame game) that should be responsible / that should care. Identify holes in your process and show it to your leadership and tell them: If these holes will not be filled with \\_caring and meaningfulness\\_ then any output pipeline will burst rather sooner than later.",

From my perspective, that gives you the authority to start making changes.\n* Personally, here's what I would do:\n   * Sit the team lead down and ask them what the hell they are doing. Have a heart to heart. Either get them on board or make them the first one out the door.\n   * Go through the current team and honestly think about who's a net positive. Keep them. Jettison the rest. You'll probably find the dead wood was holding back the ones who can actually contribute.\n   * Have a \"reset\" for the project. Make your expectations for the team clear. You expect them to think and contribute. Take the team out. Make it clear that the past is forgotten but the expectation is that shit will be different going forward.\n   * If your team lead hasn't made it this far, find new allies that can shoulder most of the responsibility in the dev team so you can refocus on the other work you've been neglecting.\n   * Get one of these to start thinking about developer practices and quality.\n   * Slowly re-add team members.\n\nNow, two months is not long, so you need to move VERY quickly. I'm a firm believer in removing dead wood as they kill motivation around them like nothing else. Even if you can't fire them, just tell them to work on crossword puzzles or something and to not bother your team. Give HR a heads up as there's bound to be whining. I guess I should also mention I'm very much a \"ask for forgiveness, not permission\" kind of person.\n\nIf you don't think this is even remotely possible, then use the two months to polish your resume and get it out there.",

Of course, you're gonna have a hard time creating leaders if the company spent the past X years beating everyone into submission.\n\nAt the end of the day it's a complicated question to answer - but if you talk to people and really listen - apply tactical empathy - the obvious answer should reveal itself.\n\nI guess we can start with this: what have the devs been griping about for the past 6 months?",

Wtf is the team lead doing? Sounds like they're not pulling their weight at all. \n\n\nIf leadership is expecting you to be responsible for the whole thing they need to give you the ability to replace team members and restructure things that are affecting delivery. \n\n\nOtherwise you need to find another job and stop trying to salvage things because this is not going to end well for you.  \n\n\nMy advice - offer a solution to leadership. They love this shit as it looks like it solves their lack of leadership. This will give you time to find a new job at the very least. \n\n\nBlame the 'delivery structure' say it needs rework and this is the new delivery structure we need to follow. \n\n\nPowerPoint an ownership and delivery structure for the team. Make it clear who owns what and say you need leadership support. Include a workflow for how things get delivered.\n\n\n- Product defines what and roadmap. Suggest a low level BA to support daily clarification and user stories. This team takes business needs, assesses cost benefit and prioritizes features. The BA supports daily discussion and clarify with dev and QA.\n- PM defines timeline and cost and *owns* delivery timing. They should be monitoring progress closely and pushing teams. \n- Dev defines how and inputs on timing. They own dev work. They provide input on roadmap from a technical perspective. \n- Ask for QA because it improves quality and catches issues early not in prod, reducing delivery cost, timing and rework. \n\n\nSuggest a 3 way shared leadership group of product, pm, and Dev lead / architect. This separates accountability and puts it in the court of the others too.\n\n\nThe PM should report progress regularly to leadership via a weekly update. This gives leadership some sense of control.  It also puts some onus on the PM. \n\n\nIf the PM/dev lead are not able to take on some leadership suggest they replace them on the team with someone who can. For the sake of delivery process. \n\n\nAt the very least this will buy you time and this exercise will give you some nice strategic shit to put on your resume. Look at this as a learning opportunity to grow your career.  ",

Your job as PM is to define requirements and set the priority of what needs to be worked on. Everything about how it gets implemented is on the dev team to figure out. Their job is to build the thing you specified, and give you their best estimate for when it will be completed. They also need to be proactive about telling you when things are going to take longer than they thought, and the only way devs will do that is if they believe that it’s safe to admit it. This can be a really tough problem to solve if you’re working with an offshore team from a country where the cultural norm is to never question anyone in a position of authority. \n\nThe estimation part can be very difficult depending on the state of the codebase they’re working in, so it helps to have an experienced developer who you can bring in early in your ideation phase to tell you when something that seems simple on the surface is actually a much larger effort, and can give suggestions for how it could be made simpler from an engineering standpoint.",

Oh we need X from another team first - Congratulations, you've discovered a dependency that is preventing your team from operating in a truly independent manner. Scrum did what it was intended to do: Find issues. It's up to you to fix it.\n2. The PRD was vague, now PO wants something different - It's gonna happen. But what changed to cause the PO to change their mind? Increased understanding of the problem space? That's a good thing.\n3. This turned out to be way more complex than estimated - That's gonna happen as well, even in cases where you thoroughly investigate the problem first. Good thing we didn't waste a lot of time estimating. Just split the story and move on.\n4. We discovered an edge case that changes everything - Awesome. Understanding increased. Value generated. Perfect. Now the ball is back in the POs court.\n\nLook, we know creating perfect plans is hard and diminishing returns bites pretty hard, pretty quickly. So:\n\n* We plan for small increments\n* We don't waste a lot of time planning\n* We get in there and start working, where the learning really happens\n* We deal with whatever pops up.\n\nThat's new product development in an uncertain problem space.\n\nNow, if you don't NEED that, that's cool.

Sprints are short _so that adjustments can be made to the forecast and risks are eventuated_.\n\nIf a failure leads to a learning, leads to an improvement, then you have a _learning organisation_ which is a rare and valuable gem. \n\nTo answer your question directly: \n\n1) failures due to external dependencies. This is because the organisation has not embraced cross functional teams, so people see an easy job, then have to put in a request with another department, who doesn't prioritize them. I call this the \"fishing minigame\" because the work is all stop until something outside your influence decides to award you a randomised outcome. \n\n2) failures due to internal dependencies. This is because we trust the (PI) plans of other teams in the trains and don't ask at the sprint review how or dependencies are coming along\n\n3) too much in the plan. Teams count the number of person hours available and fill up the team's capacity, missing the concept of focus factor or velocity. Then, they have failed to account for empirically observed interruptions\n\n4) competency collapse in some teams. Senior managers are restricting budgets for training, teams are reorganized and experts leave. You end up with C++ engineers building Jenkins pipelines, or support teams having no inkling how support teams measure themselves and survive. \n\n5) social contract collapse in some teams. Particularly post-COVID we see new starters who aren't interested in the mission, who don't understand they are paid to deliver, who use their daily standup slot to talk about their dog walking or dental appointments.",

When something feels off, missed commitments, friction between roles, unclear ownership, passive standups, the first instinct is almost always to tweak the process. Add a new ceremony. Change the retro format. Adjust story points. Rewrite the working agreement. Maybe introduce a new rule and hope it sticks.\n\nSometimes that helps. But a lot of times, it doesn’t.\n\nLooking back, some of the messiest situations I’ve seen weren’t process problems at all. They were things like unspoken frustration between team members, unclear expectations from a PO or a quiet lack of trust that no amount of backlog grooming was ever going to fix. We kept polishing the framework while avoiding the one uncomfortable conversation that actually mattered.\n\nWhat’s tricky is that process feels safe. It’s neutral. Nobody gets defensive when you suggest a new board or a different standup structure. Conversations are harder. They require naming things, slowing down and accepting that not everything can be solved with a Jira setting or a Scrum Guide quote.\n\nWhat’s a situation where you went all-in on adjusting the agile process and only later realized the real fix was just an honest conversation the team had been avoiding?",

She is not my boss though. We both report to the same director and he told me clearly that each of us were individual contributors with not much overlap in our responsibilities.\n\nTeams are already tired of constant change, and having three PMs pushing different ideas is clearly making things worse. Engagement is dropping.\n\nI’ve directly raised this with both PMs and even revisited the original responsibility document together. They acknowledged it in the moment but continued behaving the same way the following week.\n\nI actually asked my manager about potential overlap during my first week in this company and he said he didn’t see much overlap between us. However, in practice, it feels like a competition over ownership of delivery and process.\n\nI’m UK-based, while my manager, the other PMs, and most teams are offshore. I’m worried about escalating too hard and being seen as “difficult” or as rocking the boat, but the current setup isn’t working and is actively harming delivery.\n\nHow would you handle this?",

The responsibility doc exists, but it isn’t being *used* to resolve conflict, so people default to influence and visibility instead. That’s why direct conversations haven’t stuck.\n\nA few practical moves that tend to work without blowing things up:\n\nFirst, stop debating process in public forums. When ceremonies get derailed, acknowledge the input and park it. Then follow up offline. Over time this makes it clear that ceremonies aren’t a free for all and reduces performative interference.\n\nSecond, shift the escalation away from personalities and toward impact. Frame it to your manager as “teams are getting conflicting signals and delivery is slowing” rather than “PM X is stepping on my toes.” Managers act faster on risk to outcomes than on interpersonal tension.\n\nThird, ask for one thing from your manager, not a big reorg. For example, a short recurring PM sync with explicit decision rights, or a clear rule that delivery and Scrum changes funnel through one owner. You’re not asking for power, you’re asking for clarity.\n\nFourth, document decisions in writing and circulate them. Not heavy docs, just clear summaries. When someone later contradicts it, you can point to alignment already reached instead of re arguing.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that in environments like this, delivery only stabilizes when someone actively protects it. If your manager won’t do that, you have to make the risk visible without making it personal. Otherwise the teams will keep absorbing the chaos for you, and that’s usually what leadership notices too late.",

      "text": "Hi! Former QA here who recently (it was just my 3rd day yesterday) transitioned to SM role with a little bit of DM responsibilities at the Agile Team level within ART. Basically, we’re SAFe scrum (this is just for context — spare me from the hate towards SAFe, haha). \n\nI’m familiar with SM role, but I also have a lightweight DM responsibilities; tracking delivery, facilitating the planning, decision-making, etc. Our PO is stretched given he has 3 squads, so he puts his trust in the SM to deliver the output within the timeframe. And this is where I am currently struggling because I didn’t expect their process was *this* complicated (I knew I would be working with complex teams).\n\nI am feeling pressured because.. well, I am inexperienced. The SMs I replaced (they just moved to different squads, I’m still working closely with them) were DAMN great at their job. I have big shoes to fill in, but I am still adjusting and I know it is going to take me a while especially when there were no trainings, lol. I came from an Agile Team that practices *legit* scrum. Stepping into this shipwreck is such a work culture shock for me. I have been overthinking a lot — what if I fuck up? What if I make mistakes? What if I haven’t still adjusted after a month? Maybe they will think I’m such a slow-learner. What if they find me boring? What if I do straightforward meetings with not much of a small talk, will they think I’m too serious at work? \n\nOne more thing that added to pressure was when I had a catchup yesterday with my initiative lead. It sounded like she expected I already know everything because of the questions she asked. No idea what the answers were, they never came up during the catchup with the lead engineer and previous SM. \n\nThey say “fake it til you make it”, and damn right I’ve been doing that for 3 days (probably more).. but I could really use some advice on how to overcome this self-doubt and fear. How do I stop putting pressure onto myself?",

To your points, teaching and co-creating are also valuable approaches. Forcing people thrpugh a coaching approach when there is ready information is expensive and exhausting. Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes not.\n\nI'm a fairly technical coach. When you compare times I use my knowledge to times I don't, I find that applying my own technical experience is faster, unless it backfires and people feel threatened, then it's slower.

But rather, it is to help them develop the skills to solve it themsleves. You're teaching them to fish, not catching fish  for them. This is important, since you absolutely don't need to know their domain in-depth to do that. It doesn't hurt, but it's also not strictly necessary. In the end, team and org dysfunctions are broadly similar across many companies. this is why the patterns of agile are so broadly applicable. You CAN have a big impact on a team even when your attention is split across several. It helps when these teams share a domain, and it helps when you have your full attention for one at a time.

We're not reporting them to anyone.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, that's about the business outcomes we are trying to create.  \n  \nAgain, that varies with organizational and product strategy, but these are closer to \"metrics\";  they tend to boil down to the business benefits created in some way: \n\n\\- saves time (ie opportunity cost decrease)  \n\\- saves money (ie actual cost decrease)  \n\\- makes money (ie revenue increase)   \n\\- reduces risk (of slips, lapses, mistakes, rework as well as cyber etc)  \n\\- durability (extension of product lifecycle)  \n\\- convenience (UX)  \n\\- prestige (brand, status or ego)",

For those, check Evidence Based Management for metrics that can drive your product  development in a more healthy way. On a team level, flow metrics are much more valuable since they are focused on the throughput of value rather than activity.\n\nThere's is one central question you should ask yourself regarding metrics: with what intent are you measuring?\n\nMost organizations you will find they measure to exert control. They mean to ensure teams are producing enough to keep the money printer going. Aside from the obvious lack of trust this lays bare (and trust is the foundation for any agile enterprise to succeed) it also evokes Goodheart's Law. For those not familiar with it:\n\n>*\"****When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure****\"*\n\nMeasuring to control, reward or punish basically means that any metric will be gamed for the advantage of the people at the receiving end. This is where you get your watermellon reports from (green on the outside, red on this inside)\n\nHowever, if you leverage metrics for learning instead, there is no incentive to bullshit the results. In fact, it incentives to create more accurate data in order to perform better, increase flow, and create better, more satisfying outcomes. This of course requires that the organization *trusts* teams (and the people that compose them) to do the right things.",

The goal is to have this at zero. Teams should finish the sprint with nothing in progress. This doesn't include items in Todo (if the work didn't start, then it's not in progress). The wanted behavior is that there is no spillover, since it restricts the amount of high prio work we can pick next sprint. This is trivial to achieve regularly when teams know how to slice items mid sprint.\n\n\n\n\nBacklog Ranking of items picked for next sprint. The goal is to pick the top items. If the picked items are #3 and #4, we should ask why #1 & #2 were passed over. The wanted behavior is that teams respect the po's priority as much as possible. No point in a PO if the teams pick whatever they want and ignore priority. ",

          "text": "Appreciate the thoughts here, but... when it comes to metrics, everyone does them backwards!!!\n\nPeople always first identify the metric they want to track and then they move forward and eye it continuously to make sure the metric meets their interpretation. Wrong!!!\n\nFirst, you have to state - WHAT IS THE PROBLEM YOU\"RE TRYING TO SOLVE?\n\nThen, you can select the metrics that help baseline the problem and also metrics that would help track improvement. \n\nBut, the biggest failure is assuming that one or a few metrics are needed to create a picture. No. Its almost like the laws of forces in physics - \"every action has an equal and opposite reaction\". Tweaking one metric and optimizing one thing - usually triggers de-optimization of another. \n\nFor example, if you want to improve quality, get ready for slower pace of work, get ready for less new things getting done, get ready to direct more attention to bugs and support cases, which again lead to slowing down the pace of developing new things. \n\nThe next thing - how you track things is important. Do you track of averages, or do you look at specific work item and how each went? Because averages will get you in trouble. Don't focus on averages, focus on those where things are wrong. Imagine target shooting, if you keep hitting the grouping, that's not bad. To improve, focus on addressing the shots outside the grouping.\n\nSo the metrics here identified as the \"RIGHT\" metrics. Not really, they are just \"another set\" of metrics.\n\nFlow time --> how long work actually takes   >>> first, lets define it right, its now how long it takes, its how long it takes to get to the customer in production. Which is basically cycle-time + deployment time, or implementation time. Why is this important? Do you really need to track every work item delivery to the customer? Why? Customer doesn't care about all items equally. Maybe if you're running a tech consultancy, or custom dev shop, but otherwise, not really important IMHO.\n\nThroughput --> how many items are finished per unit of time >>> Unless you're following #noestimates, this serves no value. Especially if you pick up varying amounts of different type of work, because you can't decompose everything into equally measurable elements of scope. And throughput can be abused no worse than Velocity. \"Why did you guys complete only 15 items instead of throughput of 20 you got every 2 weeks for the past 3 months?\" Shitty question to ask, and even worse to answer. But... it WILL be asked.\n\nWIP --> how much work is started but not finished >>> Do you mean average WIP? Or are you trying to keep track of the limit for one team? Are you trying to track activity across multiple projects and teams to detect lack of organizational focus towards a common goal? WIP by itself is just a number. Its an indicator that serves more the most value while working, not historically from past sprints. Exceed the WIP and hit the limit? Great! Take action. Don't hit the limit for a while and the work is slow? Then limit is too large!\n\nWork item age --> how long current work has been stuck >>> Means nothing if nobody is tracking it and taking action. Not all work is same size. So what's your \"Work Item Age\" red line that has everyone asking questions? And why does the conversation about things needing help are not brought up in the daily? As a matter of fact, running a good daily makes Work Item Age metric obsolete. Its only value is if someone is stepping away from the team for a while and then coming back would like to quickly catch up to understand what's happening. \n\nSo all in all, metrics are important, but not all metrics are equal or better than another in various environments.",

      "text": "I work at a service provider as an Agile Coach, and I’ve been asking myself this question more and more lately, especially in the current economic climate.\n\nDue to budget cuts, some customers end their collaboration with service providers and bring products back in-house. For Scrum teams, this often means working on the same product for years, building deep domain and user knowledge, and taking responsibility for quality and longterm technical decisions, while knowing that the product can be taken away at any time.\n\nFrom an Agile and Scrum perspective, this creates a fundamental tension. Core principles such as product ownership, long-term value orientation, user-centered thinking, and real empowerment are hard to live when ownership ultimately always remains with the customer and is contractually limited. Empowerment tends to end where budget and contract boundaries begin.\n\nIn practice, this often leads teams, quite rationally, into a feature factory mode. The focus shifts from outcomes to outputs. Features are delivered because they are ordered, not because the team truly owns the product impact. Reviews become acceptances, user-centered thinking turns into a technique rather than a mindset, and Scrum is reduced to a well-paced delivery framework.\n\nEspecially in economically unstable times, emotional detachment feels like a form of self-protection for teams. Instead of real identification with the product, what remains is a professional delivery mode. From my point of view, this stands in clear tension with Agile values and the idea of long-lived, empowered product teams.\n\nI’m trying to understand whether this is mainly a problem of how Scrum is applied at our company, or whether this represents a structural limitation of Agile ways of working within the classic service-provider model.\n\nI’d really like to hear how others see this from an Agile or Scrum perspective.",

After all, it's all a big experiment, and experiments often fail. You can often hear, as a recommendation for defining the sprint goal, the question, 'if this were our last sprint, what would actually matter?'\n\n>  Core principles such as product ownership, long-term value orientation, user-centered thinking, and real empowerment are hard to live when ownership ultimately always remains with the customer and is contractually limited.\n\nIs the customer not interested in delivering value to the user (if he is not the user of the product himself)? Is he not interested in getting value from the product?\n\n> In practice, this often leads teams, quite rationally, into a feature factory mode. The focus shifts from outcomes to outputs. [etc]\n\nWhy is any of this natural? I can understand from your description that, ultimately, it is the customer, i.e. the party with money, who has ownership of the product; but why are they not collaborating with the development team? Why are they not interested in the outcome? Why are budget cuts responsible for this?",

While the agile values and principles can be just as valuable, when you are in a fundamentally contractual relationship with your user/customer, it becomes harder (not impossible) to apply a value like cooperation above contract negotiation.

They want to go away from having their own teams, which over the last year have become increasingly focused, happy and productive (and the internal customers along with them!). They want to go to a managed service model where 'we contractually agree to get all the benefits we have now'.\n\nI'm pessimistic about that working out. (and won't go into the fallacies in logic arguing in favour of this switch).\n\nAgain, any agile value and principle can be applied and useful (I firmly believe this holds true in any knowledge work situation), but the context makes this harder or easier, and a managed service (contractual) relationship makes it harder.",

They either don't include qa estimates at all or they have the \"devs give the estimates on the qas behalf\" (which of course doesn't pan out since devs aren't doing qa outside of unit testing).\n\nI know in Scrum there is no defined QA role as a member of the Scrum team. But in reality, the majority of the time, there is a designated QA resource that may or may not be an actual member of the team.\n\nI'm curious how others here have seen this handled and what or has not worked for your team. \n\nDo you include estimates for qa together with the devs when putting story points on?\n\nI'm especially interested to hear from anyone working in a sAFE framework and whether that makes much of a difference.

There isn't a 'dev' component or 'QA' component, but the perspectives of the people in those roles are indeed important. Something that may take an hour for a developer to complete could take days of testing effort and vice versa. You should also consider other roles such as documentation, operations, etc.\n\n2. I used story points from 2002 until the early 2010s. We eventually realized that they really didn't provide any value over just counting completed stories. If you graphed cumulative completed story points over time and cumulative completed story count over time, the lines will be almost identical. Even when the stories aren't as small as they could be this still works, based on the data I pulled from Jira for several teams I worked with.\n\nYou mentioned SAFe and I have a comment about it specifically with respect to story points. SAFe's use of them with the \"8 points per developer per sprint\" idea is complete 🐂💩. I know the two guys who originated story points and that is absolutely NOT what they intended. Also, one of those guys, Ron Jeffries, wrote a while back that he's sorry he was involved with creating the idea of story points and suggests that people don't use them.\n\nIf you need something to forecast when work will be done, I would suggest looking into Troy Magennis' work and his forecasting spreadsheets at [https://www.focusedobjective.com/pages/free-spreadsheets-and-tools](https://www.focusedobjective.com/pages/free-spreadsheets-and-tools) .",

          "text": ">**Payment Triggers:** If you are delivering incrementally (e.g., every 2 weeks), do you actually invoice every 2 weeks?\n\nIn my experience, organizations, especially larger enterprises, have policies around how they pay. In one organization, outside of paying for specific jobs (think facilities services, or from software/IT, a penetration test with a defined scope), it was a pain to have a contract that was less than a year. When we wanted to buy a SaaS product, if the vendor didn't have the desired terms, we needed to use a reseller. Paying per iteration is probably the most by-the-book \"Agile\", it's also not necessarily the most realistic.\n\nDepending on the context, you also may want to separate iteration from incremental delivery. Is your customer really accepting a delivery every 2 weeks? You may be getting feedback every 2 weeks, but you may only be delivering to production every month or two or even three. Not all customers want frequent production changes, outside of resolving critical defects and security patches.\n\nShort story: you'll probably need to separate payment cycles from your development process and account for this in the agreements and contracts, especially what happens (penalties and refunds) if they want to end the arrangement early for any reason.  \n\n\n>**The \"Half-Done\" Problem:** In civil, if a contractor leaves, usually a consulting firm hired by the contractee measure what they built and approve the payment. In software, if a vendor delivers \"90% of a feature\" and leaves, that 90% is often useless to the next vendor (who might want to rewrite it). How do you protect against paying for \"useless 90% code\"?\n\nMost of my experience is in fields where the customer doesn't get the software. They are either buying a physical product (sometimes configured to meet a particular customer's needs) that contains software or they are buying software as a service. In these cases, this isn't applicable.\n\nThe \"Agile\" answer goes back to your first question. If you're paying often, you're seeing at least demonstrations of working software very quickly and understanding the cost. You can compare value to cost and end the arrangement if things seem to be going out of control. But, seeing my answer to that part, plenty of organizations choose not to work that way, meaning they don't see the financial benefits of very short iterations and small increments.\n\nIf you are working in a situation where you deliver code to a customer, it would be on them to work with future vendors to understand the implications of using that code versus throwing it away and starting again. If you're outsourcing software development, you probably don't have the technical resources to evaluate the technical decisions made, so I'm not sure what options are available to protect yourself.  \n\n\n>**Bidding:** Do you bid purely on hourly rates? Or do clients demand a \"Fixed Price\" for a scope that hasn't been designed yet? How it mainly works in contracts?\n\nI've usually seen time-based rates for SaaS products that account for the teams supporting the product, infrastructure costs, growth, and profit margins. For custom or configured software, it was usually a cost-plus contract, either a fixed fee or goal-based incentives, with a set timeline for renewing the contract.",

They knew the rest due to daily stand-ups, dashboards showing completed migration ticket numbers, and a weekly status report. There was a formal signoff on the invoice amount, but that did not relate to looking at our work directly. Just normal corporate stuff. \n\nWe did UAT at the end-user level (\"Is it all still there and the latest version?\"), but they had no authority in the project or the cost.\n\nAnother team in my company had a similar project that was paid on migration tickets completed instead of time and material.

So *they* have to deal with the extra cost.\n\nGenerally, in consulting it's better to charge based on effort, not outcome. You have to deal with somebody else's shit, and the causer of that shit should bear the (financial) burden.

      "text": "Hi all,\n\n  \nI like to call myself an Agile professional, been in IT and related settings in both projects and continuous delivery teams. I've read up on the 'basics' like of course the Manifesto, the Scrum Guide, the little Kanban, and I've been reading articles as well as discussions around here. I've got a bunch of certifications which of course are whatever.\n\n  \nNow I\"m looking for more structured reading that constitutes a bit more of a 'deep dive' into agility. Basically broadening and deepening my knowledge and hopefully expertise. I'm thinking of reading a book per X period which I havent'defined and don't really feel like defining.\n\n  \nI\"m starting out with Mastering Professional Scrum as someone recommended it. \n\n  \nI thought of following it up with *Scrum: Art of doing twice the work in half the time* and *Coaching Agile teams.*\n\n  \nNow I thought I'd ask the community here: what books would you recommend related to Agile? Whether it be more about practical implementation, theoretical mindset, or anything else that I havent'thought of.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance! I'd of course be very interested in *why* you recommend a particular book :)",

He's in the business of selling certifications, which has done immeasurable harm to the agile community.\n\nForget the scaling stuff for now - get consistently good with one team first before trying to apply agility to any others. Even then, don't apply any scaling practices until you absolutely have to.\n\nI would suggest \"The Art of Agile Development, 2n Edition\" by Jim Shore and Dave Farley's \"Modern Software Development\".

My daughter suggested that I got scanned at a local ER (Emergency Room), June 7, 2024.  The wait was long, around 7 hours, but the decision was quick to take out the growing tumor in my upper left brain.\n\nThe next day, I was in my recovery room and every “circle one” of my family members including my son who had to take a quick flight from Taiwan to Phoenix was there to support me.  Everyone was PRESENT!\n\n**Objective Feedback**\n\n* Clinical data: scans, labs (require lots of waiting time, patience, and resilience)\n* Somatic feedback: fatigue (afternoon nap time)\n* This objective feedback is crucial in monitoring our health progress\n\n**Agile lens:**\n\n* Short inspect-and-adapt cycles\n* **Feedback as information, not judgment**\n\nI learned to treat fatigue like a signal, **not a weakness**.\n\n**Adaptability**\n\nTreatments – got a series of radiations and chemotherapies\n\n* My radiations – nice facilities and nurses\n* The chemotherapies – oral pills\n* MRI scans -every 8 weeks (on going)\n\n **Agile behaviors:**\n\n* Reprioritization over abandonment\n* Direction over prediction\n* Adaptation is not failure; it’s competence\n\n**Resilience: Sustaining the System**\n\n**Agile principle: Sustainable pace**\n\n* Rest is part of the work, YES, REST is a big part of your RECOVERY PROCESS\n* Resilience is systemic, not heroic.  We MUST follow our energy flow\n\n**Personal story:**  \nI pushed too hard early on, trying to “power through.” My recovery improved only after I treated rest as a non-negotiable sprint requirement.\n\nREST, REST and REST!!!\n\n**My Agile Team Model**\n\n**My Team**\n\n* Oncologists, nurses, caregivers\n* Family and friends\n* Me as “Product Owner”\n\n**Key insight:**\n\n* Psychological safety enables honest feedback.  Some of the honest feedback are not pleasant, i.e. my choice of Fried Chicken vs Broiled Chicken\n* Shared goals > hierarchical control. I am the Dad, Samurai style\n\n **What Agile Changed for Me**\n\n**Agile gave me:**\n\n* Language for uncertainty – realistic “time-left” in this world… really!\n* Permission to adapt without shame. It is what it is\n* Focus on progress, not perfection; progress can be seen with normal eyes\n\n **Final thought:**\n\n* Agile doesn’t remove uncertainty.  It gives us a sense of priority and urgencies.  We must take care of our available time and resources\n* Our family and friends are always there for us.  Let’s reverse our position now for without them we won’t be around anymore\n* Abandon, yes, abandon!  our so-called go-lucky friends\n* At 64, I feel HAPPY that I am surrounded by first my “circle one” family members and many happy friends\n\nMy Message to all AGILISTS:\n\n**Agile is not only a tool to double your productivity but it is a key indispensable tool that may just save you from your life crisis ONE DAY!**",

      "text": "I've recently started work in a multidisciplinary investigative team that adopted Scrum a few years ago. Think analysts, financial, tactical, (digital) forensics, OSINT, etc., all working on the same investigations. We run 4-week sprints, do sprint planning/review/retro, and track everything on a Kanban board.\n\nComing from a software/engineering background, I’m increasingly struggling with how planning is done for investigative and technical work. What I’m slowly realizing is that the core problem isn’t Scrum or Kanban (or Scrum vs Kanban for that matter), but what my team thinks a ticket should represent.\n\nRight now, a ticket is treated as “a set of known steps that can be planned up front”. That works fine for administrative or coordination work (prepare a meeting → make slides → book room → send invite). Because that’s how most of the team works, the same level of detail is expected from technical and forensic work during sprint planning.\n\nSo engineering tickets get forcibly worded and broken down into tangible, step-like todos to make them understandable and plannable up front.\n\nThe issue is that investigative/engineering work just doesn’t behave that way. Or at least that is what I think. When I get a forensic image, I don’t know yet if it’s usable, whether it’s a RAID, a VM host, corrupted, unsupported, or irrelevant. The work is mostly figuring out *what the work even is*. Planning detailed todos like “copy image”, “generate report”, “analyze report” creates a false sense of predictability and usually has to be rewritten anyway.\n\nWhat makes this really visible is what happens later. Toward the end of a sprint — or after working on the same ambiguous ticket for two or more sprints — it often becomes clear that different people had very different expectations of what that ticket actually entailed at the time of planning. The ticket looked concrete on the board, but the shared understanding wasn’t there. That is something I would really like to get the team aligned on again.\n\nCurious how others have dealt with this, especially in law enforcement, forensics, or other exploratory knowledge-work environments.",

          "text": "What you are describing is not a failure of investigative work.\nIt is a failure to distinguish refinement work from increment work, and a system that is uncomfortable with uncertainty.\n\nScrum is a social technology for empirical control in complex work. It does not assume the work is knowable up front. Kanban, used alongside it, is an observability pattern. Its purpose is to make the state of work, its age, and its flow visible, not to provide comfort through false precision.\n\nRight now, tickets are being treated as if they must represent a sequence of known steps. That forces discovery to pretend it is delivery. The board looks clear, but the understanding is not.\n\nA key distinction is being missed:\n\n- Refinement work changes the Product Backlog.\nIt reduces uncertainty, clarifies intent, surfaces constraints, and determines what might be worth doing next.\n\n- Sprint work changes the Increment.\nIt produces something usable and inspectable that advances the product or investigation.\n\n\nWhen refinement is treated as if it should behave like increment work, teams manufacture certainty early and then pay for it later in misalignment and rework.\n\nIn investigative and forensic contexts, it is entirely normal, and often correct, for the majority of a Sprint to be spent in refinement. If the primary constraint is lack of understanding, then reducing that uncertainty is the highest-value work available. Scrum does not optimise for output per Sprint; it optimises for learning and control.\n\nThe only requirement is that refinement is intentional, time-bounded, and minimal but sufficient. Open-ended analysis is not the goal, but neither is pretending the work is understood when it is not.\n\nKanban should make this visible. If refinement dominates, that is a signal about the nature of the work, not a problem to be hidden.\n\nTrying to force increment-style delivery before understanding exists does not increase predictability. It just creates fiction.\n\nIf you want to chat about it you hit me up for a diagnostic conversation on [Hinshelwood.com](Https://Hinshelwood.com)",

              "text": "Agreed. \n\nI'd suggest that perhaps to fit in with the current system that each of these tickets be broken in 2-4 tickets - one to analyse, unserstand and prioritise the nature of the work, and then other fuzzy tickets to actually do the work (depending on what it is) - obviously these would be vague, uncertain and have a planning estimate that is a range, but at least this would give visibility that there is work, as yet unknown, that is unknowable without the initial work, and there is initial work to be done to even give definition to the whole ticket's work. (Note ticket -> multiple backlog items, due to uncertainty all work cannot be known at start of sprint)\n\nAs u/mrhinsh says \"Kanban should make this visible. If refinement dominates, that is a signal about the nature of the work, not a problem to be hidden.\" Basically, make the work that you need to do and the nature of that work visible. \n\nI've seen Scrum perfectionists that insist that only the (initial) analysis be planned into a sprint as that is the only estimable work, but then have managers insist that the unknown work needs to be planned for the current sprint as it cannot wait for the next sprint - in that case, just became evident that Strict Scrum with planned sprints was not appropriate for the work in question.

                  "text": "I would strongly advise against breaking work down by activity.\n\nActivities have no value on their own. Value exists only potentially in the outcome that emerges from a combination of activities that results in something usable or inspectable. When work is split into “analysis” and then “delivery”, you create hand-offs, false completion points, and the familiar “analysis is done, my part is finished” behaviour. That weakens empiricism rather than strengthening it.\n\nI do agree with the underlying intent of your comment: the nature of the work and its uncertainty must be visible. Where I disagree is how that visibility is achieved.\n\nThe focus of Scrum, or any empirical approach, is potential value delivery and learning, not accounting for individual actions. Visibility comes from making uncertainty explicit, not from decomposing it into artificially precise steps.\n\nUrgency does not turn uncertainty into commitment; it just increases the cost of pretending it is understood.\n\nOn the “Scrum perfectionists” point, this usually is not Scrum at all. It is a Dunning–Kruger effect: people who understand the mechanics but not the theory. Scrum does not require that everything anyone does is represented as a backlog item. That assumption is simply false.\n\nIn Scrum, only work that is intended to change the Increment must be represented in the Sprint Backlog. There is always significant refinement work that happens before an item is ready to be selected. That work produces learning, clarity, and Product Backlog changes, not increments. It does not need to be planned into the Sprint Backlog to be legitimate or valuable, but it does need to be done deliberately.\n\nTrying to force refinement into “planned sprint work” is exactly how teams end up pretending uncertainty does not exist. Making uncertainty visible is correct. Turning learning into activity tickets is not.",

If the work is too uncertain, you reduce the length of the sprint, which shortens the feedback loop, such that you don't need to guess for a long time ahead.\n\n\\> Toward the end of a sprint <...> it often becomes clear that different people had very different expectations of what that ticket actually entailed at the time of planning. The ticket looked concrete on the board, but the shared understanding wasn’t there.\n\nAgain, in proper scrum, developers, i.e. people who are actually going to work on the tickets, pull the tickets in from the product backlog during sprint planning after they have agreed that it is doable, and kinda know what they are going to do. When the ticket has moved from the product backlog to the sprint backlog, developers are free to split it however they feel the best to discover the work.\n\nSo how does it happen that people have different expectations of a ticket during sprint planning? Where was the discussion; how did the ticket appear in the sprint backlog?\n\nAgain, having shorter sprints should help with reducing the size of the bets.",

Don't overthink it or try to fake deep Agile expertise you don't have yet. Be honest about being newer to the formal PO title but confident about your transferable skills in prioritization, stakeholder management, and translating business needs into actionable work. They're testing if you're worth passing to the hiring manager, not if you can recite the Scrum Guide.\n\nThe biggest red flags they're listening for are bad-mouthing previous employers, unclear career motivations, unrealistic salary expectations that waste everyone's time, or someone who clearly has no idea what a Product Owner actually does. Your background is actually solid for this transition - data-driven decision making and stakeholder translation are core PO competencies - so just connect those dots clearly and show genuine interest in the product ownership path. If you want to practice articulating your experience in terms that resonate with PO interview questions, I built [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat) to help with exactly that - it gives real-time guidance on how to frame your answers when you're navigating these transitions.",

Especially if one is to be leveraged towards critical, complex, and strategic projects in the business.\n\nLet's be honest, the PMP is not easy to get. For the vast majority of people, it takes serious study and rigor. I have never met any PM who achieved the PMP by taking the test cold, without any (or just a little) study. Conversely, I achieved my Scrum Master and Product Owner certs with just a week's worth of study for each (to be fair, those frameworks are light by design which does not make them inadequate). In my program, PMs with a PMP or PRINCE2 - for my European PMs - generally outperform those without them. What we have observed across our PMs is that the cert provides a common framework for governance and execution that is hard to replicate.\n\nBut, do we hire PMs without certification? Absolutely. We still hire uncertified PMs if their communication and skill-specific thought logic show obvious value. If they are the right fit, we will hire a PM and actually pay to get them certified later.\n\nThe PMP isn’t a magic pill, but it’s far from decorative. It’s a tool that, when combined with the right personal/professional attributes, makes a huge difference. Is it the end all, be all? No. It isn't.",

You can't tell me exactly what you need done, so I can't tell you when it will be done.\n\nNow, if you can tell me exactly what needs to be done, don't take an Agile approach. It is inefficient and the benefits aren't needed.

      "text": "I'm in a somewhat unique situation at a firm where the information security team operates in a way that I believe is against best practices. Rather than providing stakeholder representation for every phase of a project, they instead hold weekly 1 hour meetings where we attempt to cover an agenda of topics for them to review. These are prepared topics that have arisen during meetings over the previous week (or sometimes longer) during project initiation or really any phase of a project may be in-progress. Essentially the dev team is responsible for trying to predict when something on a project requires security review, gets it on the agenda, and waits until that weekly meeting to bring it to the group and find out if they give it a thumbs-up, thumbs-down, or require more time to review.  \nThis creates some obvious problems when something high-priority is blocked because of the need to wait for that weekly meeting. It's also inefficient when the security team has minimal or no context to the project at hand, because they have not been participating in any of it. Trying to get them up to speed on the project so that they can understand why we are asking for permission to \"do the thing\" (access some internal database, connect to a 3rd party API, etc...) can make everything even more chaotic.  \nAll formal guidance states that the information security team should be involved in *every phase* of a project including refinement, participating in user stories (creation, acceptance criteria, sign-offs), building, testing, releases, etc... so that they are not an afterthought. This has been my experience in all previous work, except for my current engagement.  \nIt's odd to me that the dev team would own responsibility for knowing what that team should care about, and be on the hook for bringing it to their attention, but then also possibly getting an entire solution slapped down at release time when the security team may hop in and find something they don't like.  \nIs this completely non-standard? Should an effort be made to change the style of the information security team and have them be an active stakeholder in all phases of a project? Is it absurd for the dev team to spend time preparing topics for the security team to review? Is it reasonable for the dev team to stay on top of the ever-evolving standards of what that team may or may not care about?",

      "text": "\nAgile is never about speed.\nIt was about reducing risk when the path ahead isn’t fully visible...\n\nYet most teams forget this. They treat Agile as a way to move faster, deliver more and keep everyone busy. When that happens, meetings multiply, pressure increases, Agile starts to feel heavy...often declared a failure.\n\nBut Agile was born for a very different reason!!\n\nImagine having to build a bridge across a river when you can’t see the far bank clearly. You don’t design the entire bridge upfront. You also don’t jump blindly. You build one solid span, step onto it, test it, and only then extend the next.\n\nThat is Agile. A mindset when the path ahead is uncertain. It is about informed progress through smaller commitments, not reckless speed.\n\nAnd Scrum???? \n\nScrum is simply the framework that makes agile possible.\n\n A Sprint is one span of the bridge you can safely stand on. Not half-built. Not “almost done.” If it can’t carry real load, it isn’t a span.\n\nThe Backlog is the pile of materials waiting to be used. You don’t grab everything. You choose what helps extend the bridge safely, in the right direction.\n\nThe Product Owner is the person who knows where the bridge must lead. Not how every plank is laid, but which direction actually matters.\n\nThe Daily Stand-up is a quick alignment before you build further. Are we steady? Did anything weaken yesterday’s span? Should we pause before stepping forward?\n\nThe Review is where you test the span with real weight. It's about the span, not the builders. If it can’t be used, then speed is irrelevant. \n\nThe Retrospective is about the builders and the method, not the (tested) span itself. Where did we struggle, what slowed us down, what can be done better.\n\nAnd the Scrum Master exists for one reason only: to make sure discipline and safety aren’t compromised when pressure rises.\n\n Teams go wrong because they concentrate on how fast they build the spans, not whether they can be trusted.\n\nFast progress on weak spans feels productive. Until it collapses!!!\n\nAgile leadership isn’t about asking how quickly the team can move.\nIt’s about asking a quieter, harder question:\n\nIs the next step safe to stand on?\n\n",

That it's simply \"better\", and for stressed out program/project/product managers better, to them, often means faster because that's how they're measured - reach delivery at deadline or not.\n\nIMO there will always be an inherent conflict with organizations and agile in that agile is a quality framework but far from every organization cares about quality. Quality is speed in the long run but few care about the long run either. And as there's no speed-in-the-short-run framework, people are going to try to make scrum into a methodology for that regardless of if it can do that or not.\n\nIn my opinion we also wouldn't be as desperate for speed if we'd be better at estimation, and while story points is pretty good for that in short iterations we don't have any good methods for programs, larger deliveries etc. The biggest reason we want speed is because we're desperate to reach badly estimated deadlines to begin with.

              "text": "Your comment is overall good and I agree in general, but I'd like to push against the recommendation to move away from browser tests. I believe when people do browser tests they don't only move up a level of abstraction, they also abandon the idea of atomic tests. While our unit & integration tests test one thing at a time, our browser tests test a whole flow start to finish. I believe this is where the problem lies: Long flow tests are brittle, slow, give no information when they fail and therefore difficult to fix, and in the case of OP, difficult to configure with flags.\n\n  \nIf you had atomic browser tests (testing one user action, or only a few user actions at a time), a lot of the pain goes away, including the feature flag problem: If a specific action is related to a flag, you have now two tests: one doing the action with the flag and one without it. The rest of the flags don't matter since they're not part of the atomic action. In this way the tests actually help by documenting the active flags and how they affect the system. When a flag is removed and a choice is made, one of those tests would fail, providing proof that the removal of the flag also removed the now-defunct behavior.",

They are incredibly slow (compared to other tests), hard to maintain and they break easily.\n\nTherefore it is fair to ask \"what are we really testing here?\".  Or \"what value does it add to test this via the browser?\"   \nThere can be valid reasons to do it, but we should ask those questions.\n\nIf we are testing that a button triggers the right function, we don't need an automated test to confirm that 20 times a day.\n\nIf we are testing a flow, we may be able to test that one level deeper where we decouple the test from the page-layout.\n\nMany people treat automation like it is automating the steps that a manual tester would do. A manual tester runs everything once and while he's doing his flow, he also tests every screen and every button - especially because it's so time-consuming.  \nAn automated test does not need that.\n\nI've seen someone manually test a function by setting up data and using the browser to go through the flow. Took 1.5 days to do it once.  But the function could (and should) have been tested on the unit-level. Writing the unittest took 1.5 hours and it runs in 0.1 seconds.",

      "text": "Over the past two weeks, I’ve been reflecting on why our Scrum process feels broken, and I want to share our current situation to get an outside perspective. Officially, we use Agile Scrum, and on paper the process looks reasonable. User stories appear to be sprint-sized, and we still run sprint planning and other ceremonies. However, the way management interprets and enforces the process fundamentally contradicts how Scrum is supposed to work.\n\nOne major issue is how user stories are treated during delivery. Management does not accept that a user story should be completed collectively by the whole Scrum team within a sprint. Instead, stories are evaluated and approved based on individual man-days. Effort is calculated per person, not as a team commitment. This turns user stories into time-accounting units rather than sprint-level goals, and it removes the idea of shared ownership and collaboration.\n\nAt a higher level, epics are still considered the entire project, while milestones are treated as phase-based breakdowns, similar to waterfall. Each milestone contains only a few user stories, but those stories bundle many features and dependencies. Although these stories look like sprint-sized items, they actually represent a large amount of work spread across multiple people and a long duration, justified through man-day calculations rather than sprint capacity.\n\nSprint planning becomes mostly ceremonial. The scope and effort expectations are effectively decided upfront through man-day assumptions, leaving little room for the team to challenge feasibility or break work down meaningfully. No one really speaks up during planning, not because the issues aren’t obvious, but because the delivery model is already fixed outside the Scrum framework. Planning becomes alignment with pre-approved numbers instead of a collaborative discussion about what can realistically be delivered in one sprint.\n\nThe Product Owner role is also heavily constrained. The PO is not fully allowed to write or refine user stories independently. Acceptance criteria and Definition of Done are decided centrally (mainly by the unit head), which turns user stories into rigid contracts instead of flexible, value-driven items. This prevents proper backlog refinement and removes the PO’s ability to negotiate scope or adapt stories based on feedback and sprint learnings.\n\nOrganizationally, there is a strong control dynamic. The section head prefers to centralize decisions and processes, which limits the unit head’s autonomy and ability to support the team properly. As a result, the unit head enforces rigid and often unrealistic business processes that don’t actually help delivery. This creates a lack of trust in the team’s ability to self-organize and deliver outcomes, reinforcing the reliance on man-day calculations instead of empirical progress.\n\nOverall, the core problem is not that our user stories are obviously too big on paper, but that Scrum is being overlaid on top of a waterfall, control-driven mindset. User stories are treated as individual cost units, not as sprint-level team commitments. Leadership does not appear to trust the team to deliver collectively, and key roles are not allowed to function as intended. Because of this, the process looks Agile on the surface, but behaves very differently in practice.\n\nI’m sharing this to understand whether others have experienced similar “Agile in name only” setups, and how they’ve handled working within—or escaping—this kind of system.\n",

Your org is a traditional waterfall org that's wearing a Scrum costume.\n\nThere might be cultural elements at play. Broadly speaking, some types of businesses (and some cultures) have a certain way of doing things that make it harder to actually adopt agile. You might be facing a company culture or even a regional culture that favor hierarchy, centralized decision making and emphasis on risk control, making true agility practically impossible to adopt broadly.",

          "text": "A few thoughts:\n\n* The core problem is not that you're stories are too big.\n* The core problem is that you're trying to wedge a collaborative, bottom up, empirical, feedback based process into a command and control, top down, predictive, wish based culture.\n* What was the original driver that led to using Scrum? Management can hardly have understood Scrum and still signed off on its usage.\n* To me, there feels like are a few ways you could find yourself in this situation:\n   * Scrum was a grass roots movement\n   * Significant portions of management are not communicating with each other. Someone launched Scrum without getting buy in from the rest of the management tier.\n* If you have an agile coach or champion, they either do not know their job, or they do and they've realized this is a boondoggle and are simply cashing their checks.\n* My recommendation:\n   * For the sake of the people in the teams, stop doing Scrum.\n   * Have a \"come to Jesus\" meeting. Review why Scrum is even being attempted. Are those goals reasonable and achievable?\n   * Explain the obvious conflicts between the intent of Scrum and the current environment.\n   * Either get some buy in for an actual Scrum trial or discard Scrum altogether.\n   * If you don't have a champion for Scrum that can talk to management, get one.\n\nScrum is probably the most demanding agile method, when it comes to up front organizational change. Management likely made the assumption that the change was for the line workers, not for them. If management has no intention of changing, then Scrum is doomed and you're just wasting time, money, and sanity.",

A lot of government contracts were created with annual deliverable goals. The offshore developer contracts billed by the hour. The structure in between was supposed to be Scaled Agile. \n\nThose were three completely different measurement units of input, throughput, and output. I had to accept that 1 point = 8 hours and break the agile terminology. I had to encourage PO/PM package development stories into MVP bundles of discrete functionality.  I had to treat a bloated release train like a solution train of four release trains in dashboard and reporting. I moved value determination to the PM issue creation instead of the PI planning then replaced the Inspect and Adapt ceremony with RCA topics pulled from Retrospectives.\n\nNone of it was scaled agile by definition but it worked really well.\n\nAgile is a framework. Breaking it where it needed to be broken and adapting it where it needed to be adapted made it work.",

That makes estimation easier and aligns well with capacity of each team member. Are you also considering risks and dependencies in your estimation process? Just be sure your point scale makes sense. A 1 and a 2 point story should be equivalent to a single 3 point story.  Similarly, a 3 and a 5 point story should be equivalent to a single 8 point story. Try having the PO establish objectives instead of defining user stories - like, \"complete development of X\" or \"Y deployment complete\". Then have the team flesh out those objectives with user stories. Use those retrospectives to fine tune the process and continuously improve.",
