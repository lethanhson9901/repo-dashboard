      "text": "I’ve been working at this company for 10 years, currently as a manager overseeing several IT teams. The company has its own internal IT department building internal products. When I started, we were moving from classic waterfall to Scrum. Like in any big corporation (2,000+ people in IT alone), it was slow and painful.\n\nDemos were basically walking through the backlog and accounting for every single task. Sprints had no real goal. Former analysts became Product Owners, and people with the least actual work were sent to Scrum Master trainings. Dailies were used by team leads to check if everyone was “doing something.” The organization cared about how much we delivered and how late it was - not *what* we delivered or what value it brought. A textbook “agile transformation.”\n\nBut after a few years, real change started to show. POs really dug into their domains and had deep knowledge of customers and competitors. IT invested in DevOps to speed up releases. Architecture evolved from one big monolith deployed 5 times a year into hundreds of independent microservices deployed on demand. Backlogs started to reflect actual customer needs instead of just task lists. Employee engagement scores were well above industry average in every survey. Over all of this watched a transformation department made up of Scrum Masters and change leaders.\n\nThen the board changed.\n\nThe new board introduced a new one-year strategy. This strategy had little to do with the product visions owned by individual POs and was pushed into IT through side channels. Chaos followed. Suddenly the board started blaming department directors for not delivering *their* goals. Directors started holding POs accountable for their existing roadmaps while trying to kill future increments to make room for “the strategy.” At the same time, IT directors bypassed POs entirely and pushed architectural changes under the label of “technical debt.”\n\nTeams ended up with three priorities: one from the PO, one from “the business,” and one from IT. Every delay caused fights between these three sides, finger-pointing, and accountability theater. A year passed. The board’s strategy was not delivered.\n\nSo the board decided to fire the entire transformation department (including all Scrum Masters) and introduced “improvement actions” to make sure this would never happen again.\n\nThose improvements included:\n\n* assigning an additional Project Manager to every PO to “help deliver projects on time”\n* abandoning story points in favor of estimating every task in days\n* limiting time for technical debt and bugs (!) to 10% and strictly enforcing reporting\n* hiring additional analysts to create Feature Requirement Documents for every product to “help IT estimate better and improve predictability”\n\nAll of this, of course, branded as *improving our agile way of working*.\n\nThat was 6 months ago.\n\nMore than half of the teams I know haven’t released a single change to production since then. Some teams still haven’t received FRDs for any change at all - analysts have been working on documentation for 6 months, and IT doesn’t even know what’s in it yet. I personally reviewed one of those documents (they had dependencies on my system) and saw that an FRD for a simple change was already 100 pages long.\n\nAt one point they asked me to confirm a single variable. I told them I’d look at it in a month because I was working on something else. They replied that in a month they’d already be assigned to another project and wouldn’t be able to update the document anymore.\n\nI’ve also heard Project Managers explicitly telling teams *not* to log time spent on technical debt, because we’d burn through our yearly 10% too fast and wouldn’t have any left for “more important bugs” later.\n\n10 years of transformation.  \nBuried in 6 months.\n\nI’m watching all of this from the sidelines. My department hasn’t gone through the new “transformation” yet and we’re still working the old way - just the team and the PO. We’re the last department in line for the great enlightenment. I’m going to try to use this time to prove to everyone above that the “old” system can still be efficient. Wish me luck - the last island of agility in this waterfall of despair.\n\nIn my opinion, the board threw the baby out with the bathwater. After the first year they clearly lost trust in POs and dismantled the entire system instead of trying other approaches. Not all POs were good at their job, and that’s probably the most important lesson I’m taking away from this whole story: being a PO is brutally hard and comes with real responsibility. Not everyone is cut out for it, and not everyone should take on that role. And paradoxically, over the last few months the best POs left, while the worst ones stayed - still pretending to be product owners, even though most of their decision-making power is already gone.",

          "text": "This is one of the most honest posts I've read here in a while. \n\nThe part that's going to bother people is that both sides of your story prove the same thing. Agile was never the variable. Organizational power structure was.   \n\nWhen the old board gave teams space, invested in DevOps, let POs grow into their domains, things improved. Not because of Scrum. Because leadership created conditions where competent people could do good work.   \n\nWhen the new board showed up they didn't kill Agile. They killed the conditions that made it work. Then blamed the framework for failing. Then replaced it with 100-page FRDs and project managers layered on top of POs. That's just waterfall with extra steps and a body count.   \n\nThe part about PMs telling teams not to log technical debt time. That's not process improvement. That's cooking the books. Everyone in the room knows it but nobody can say it because the people who created the rule are the ones who'd have to hear it.   \n\nYour observation about the best POs leaving while the worst stayed is a pattern I've seen over and over. You strip decision-making power from a role, the people who were good at making decisions leave. The ones who were always just going through the motions don't even notice the difference.   \n\nGood luck being the last island, I mean that. But start documenting your results now., delivery frequency, incident rates, team retention. When the \"great enlightenment\" reaches your department, the only thing that might save you is numbers that make someone above pause before flipping the switch.",

      "text": "At my last company Agile was real. Leadership backed it. The business understood it. Teams actually existed. Product owners owned something. It was not perfect, but it was honest and it delivered value more often than excuses.\n\nThen I came to this place that promised a big Agile transformation. What I walked into was project management with a new paint job.\n\nTwo months after I joined, new boss. Zero tech background. His boss? Zero tech background, but twenty plus years of traditional PM thinking and a deep love for dashboards that measure absolutely nothing useful. And the mindset that he’s right about everything and knows everything.\n\nNow we are “Agile” because we hold standups and shove work into ADO, which is a horrible tool, been begging for JIRA since Day 1. Leadership converts story points into days to close like math is optional and common sense is a rumor.\n\nThe newest brilliant idea is a KPI for velocity tracking. Not to help teams improve. Not to learn anything. Just to have a KPI to make it look like we’re doing something.\n\nThey also created a “demand intake process” and tried to make it Agile. It used to be a ticket queue with paperwork. Now it is a ticket queue with epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria that read like a legal contract. Same red tape, just wrapped in Scrum vocabulary.\n\nThere are no real teams. Everyone works on their own thing. Minimal collaboration. Priorities flip every couple of days. Ceremonies are status meetings with new names. Product ownership doesn’t exist, there’s no product. We are not Agile.\n\nSo I am stepping away from Agile for a while. Unless someone at the top decides to actually understand what Agile is, this will never change. They will keep measuring the wrong things, rewarding the wrong behavior, and acting shocked when nothing improves.\n\nAnyone else stuck in a similar Agile transformation?\n\nOh, and my boss uses ChatGPT to reply to every email the team sends now. Is that a new thing people are experiencing? Should I follow suite?",

As a Tester for many, many years, I need this information to be able to deduce if something has been implemented correctly (also understanding the hierarchy of functionality is handy).  Acceptance Criteria is crucial for me as tester to be able to deduce how 'well' whatever has been built.  That's not red tape, that's someone doing their job properly when they create PBI's.\n\n'Priorities flip every few days'.  Yup, that's part of having an Agile mindset.  The PO can change their mind about what the team builds every single day if they deem it necessary.  Sure, it's a pain in the arse and it's entirely inefficient, but being able to change direction is exactly what Agile teaches.  \n\nThere's also nothing wrong with velocity tracking, although it should primarily be used by Feature Teams themselves for their own reflection/planning.  Once you start to see external Stakeholders use the metrics, then be cautious.  Caveat, I have seen Finance departments use velocity to calculate the cost of Sprints in order that they fund teams appropriately.  Understanding that there is an eco system around teams is a very good thing.  You don't exist in isolation.  \n\nThere are no ceremonies mentioned in the Agile manifesto.  This sounds like you don't understand things, your points are vague.  Are you referencing Scrum here?  Agile is a set of mindset behaviour and principles, makes no reference to US points or how US's should be formulated for example.  \n\nWhen someone starts to criticise something, I always ask them to suggest something better.  Usually, they can't.  Don't be one of those people.  ",

Well-run planning sessions are an example (as compared to someone projecting Jira on a screen while everyone else just watches). Training people is MUCH harder when everyone is remote, but it can be done.\n\nNow counter that with the productivity and mental health gains of not having to commute, working in a comfortable space, being able to take breaks when needed, etc., and I think the gains at least balance the drawbacks.\n\nThere are exceptions, of course, but I'm firmly in the \"get together in person when it makes sense to do to, otherwise work wherever you're most productive\" camp.\n\nAs for the Manifesto, it represents a \"point in time\" state of the industry where we were railing against the massive processes that delivered more binders of requirements and change requests than actual value.

I \"grew up\" as a software developer during the same times as the people who wrote it, and experienced the same issues with the massive processes of the 1980s and 1990s. The \"funny\" part is that the complaints I hear today about Scrum and SAFe and other 🐂💩 approaches are the same ones we were making and the same ones that led to the Agile Manifesto being written in the first place!\n\nI'm lucky enough to know several of the authors of the manifesto, count some as friends and to even have worked with some of them. From all that, I know what they were trying to achieve, and for a while in the early 2000s they (we!) did! Things started to go south when the Certified Scrum Master program became popular and you could be \"certified\" after parking your arse in a chair for two days. Scrum also appealed to the project management community because it focused on just that - project management practices - where XP extended those with the technical practices as well.\n\nAnd here we are today, 25 years later, with islands of \"good\" in a vast sea of mediocrity and outright crap. I'm still building software, both hand-writing it and using LLMs, and helping individual teams as I go.\n\nOh, as for no estimates, I haven't estimated a story in years. I have, however, provided forecasts for releases constantly based on progress using story \\*counts\\* (Monte Carlo simulations are fantastic for this). I just break the required work down into the smallest reasonable stories and give a forecast (OK, estimate) based on the delivery rate of prior work.

We are an architecture/engineering setup with long-running projects, billable hours, resource planning, QA steps, and also a lot of invoicing tied to the work so I feel like Jira feels extremely task-heavy and too focused on software projects to help us with that specifically. We don’t really need epics and sprints as much as we need visibility from proposal to delivery and without integrations if possible tbh. I’m not even sure if this is possible but a girl can dream right?? \n\nCurious what people are using that’s more vertically focused and not just another kanban board with plugins on plugins.",

They're built for agencies and professional services where the project isn't a backlog of stories — it's a scope of work with a budget attached. \n\nThe fact that you already know you don't need epics and sprints means you've already figured out the most important thing.

The only real restriction is you can only have 3 levels of task (epic/issue/subtask) in a project--but a) you can add 2 more if you go cross-project with some of the Advanced Roadmap stuff, and b) you can create issue types that are whatever you want so you don't ever have to use the word epic for any reason. Call 'em phase, subphase, and task if you want.  \n\nDefinitely not a bad idea to look at other stuff, I just look at it and think \"I could make Jira work for that\".",

You adopt adaptive methods when there's uncertainty or ambiguity in the work, so there's an inherent need to accept this ambiguity and make decisions even when you don't (and won't) have the full picture. There's also usually a greater sense of shared ownership, with the project manager doing less controlling and managing and more sharing knowledge and expertise, so the team can own the work and the process. All of this requires shifting from a doing mindset to a facilitating, teaching, coaching, and sometimes partnering mindset.\n\nAgility sometimes comes with a shift to a product-centric organization, which also changes the role of a project manager. Ownership shifts to product management and long-term product goals, with project management supporting the movement toward those goals rather than serving as the primary funding and organizational structure.",

Scrum, for example, focuses heavily on short-term execution but often treats long-term planning as if it doesn’t exist. Since clients and accounting departments usually require fixed budgets and timelines, PMs are left to bridge that gap. It’s difficult to satisfy both the dev team and the stakeholders when the process itself doesn't provide a framework for that ambiguity.",

Organizations start to make big changes and then the change fades and they lose attention and momentum. As I read it I thought of how many coaches and scrum masters I've heard tell the same story. However, I also found myself thinking \"This guy needs to be proud of the change he accomplished. Not every company wants or needs to be a B Corp. And over the weekend I thought, \"I should take my own advice.\"\n\nNot every company wants or needs to be Spotify or whatever company you read about. Sure, I worked a company that changed their industry with Scrum and another that saved their company with it, but most just got a little nicer to work at or gained a smoother deployment process, and honestly, good for them.\n\nI also look around at how software is made now vs in the 80's and 90's and wow has Agile made a big change. Anyone else remember just having architects and BAs work on a project for 6 months and then having a thousand-page long requirements doc to hand to developers and then they couldn't ask the architects anything because they were off on another project? You don't see that around much anymore. And testing - remember how we used to do testing? No unit tests, no testing before you call a feature d9ne. Just build the whole damn thing then send 18 months worth of code over to the testing department and watch the bugs come back in swarms. \n\nWe've changed and improved a lot as an industry and Agile has been a big driver of it. People can dislike Agile all they want, but I don't see any of them running back to the old ways of working. Hope that brightens a few people's day.",

Compared to 80s and 90s, we have supercomputers at our disposal and network speeds to match. Makes sense that the development process speeds up as well.\n\nThe problem is, organizations leadership don't want to adapt to an agile mindset. They still operate in that factory era mindset. And it does make sense because the rest of the world, starting from the shareholders, operate in that way. They want future predicions and plans and strategies for months on ahead.

It was version control getting better, CI/CD becoming practical, cloud infrastructure making deployment cheap, and the internet forcing shorter feedback loops. The tooling changed the game. Agile gave it a name and a framework.   \n\nThe part that concerns me is when \"we're better than the 90s\" becomes the bar. Yeah, we are. But that's a low bar. We went from no testing to checkbox testing. From no collaboration to ceremony-driven collaboration. From waterfall to sprints that often run like mini-waterfalls anyway.   \n\nBetter than the 90s? Absolutely. As good as we could be? Not even close.   I don't think the people frustrated with Agile want to go back, they want to go forward. Past the certifications, past the theater, past the process that replaced one kind of rigidity with another. The original manifesto was about people and outcomes. What most of us live with daily is Jira workflows and sprint velocity charts.   \n\nSo yeah. Take the win. The industry is better. But let's not confuse \"better than awful\" with \"good.\"",

So the whiteboard stays full of \"everything we thought of\" and nobody wants to be the one who says \"most of this isn't happening.\" So it just sits there. A graveyard, like you said.   The tool gap you're feeling is real but even if you had a perfect whiteboard-to-wireframe pipeline, you'd still need someone to decide what moves forward and what dies. That's the hard part. No tool solves that.   \n\nThat said, if you want less friction between thinking and building, Figjam → Figma is probably the closest thing to what you're describing.

Get's pretty \"heavy weight\" with a lot of sunk costs.\n\nProduct discovery is complex, so probe-sense-respond is the way to go.  And the best probe in an agile context is working, production grade software,  Not wireframes, or PoCs, or requirements, or any of that.\n\nMy go-to approaches tend to be: \n\n**- rapid lean canvas session,** so we are all on the same page on the problem being solved, why it matters, the benefits we want, how we'll measure them, key assumptions/risk and the user domain SMEs (or personas) we will be actively collaborating with when we work;  maybe 2 x 45 minute sessions, with a \"into backlog\" or \"rejected\" outcome\n\n**- user story mapping** with a couple of those SMEs, and the \"three amigo\": pattern;  record the session\n\n**- XP delivery;**  user domain SMEs embedded in and co-creating with the team, thin value slices, \"end-to-end\" skeleton first then add stuff by risk/value and get ultra fast feedback.\n\nIf the business is worried about investment risk then wrap Scrum round the outside, so you can make \"continue/stop/pivot\" decisions in a short cycle and invest one Sprint at a time, while delivering multiple increments per Sprint.\n\nWhich is all \"agile\" really ever was; make change cheap, easy fast and safe (no new defects) and get ultra-fast feedback on what is valuable. \n\nExercises like \"elephant carpaccio\" really bring this home for developers, as does the \"journey to work\" exercise in Jeff Patton's book on user story mapping\n\n[https://blog.crisp.se/2013/07/25/henrikkniberg/elephant-carpaccio-facilitation-guide](https://blog.crisp.se/2013/07/25/henrikkniberg/elephant-carpaccio-facilitation-guide) \n\n",

You'd be better of hiring some good XP people and doing cheap modern leadership courses for everyone.  **(Done both.  Works great.)**\n\nPLUS - \n\n**Transformations don't work.  They really, really don't.**    \n  \nThey pick the low hanging fruit - restructure, new jobs, new events/meetings and it's out with Gant Charts, in with Scrum Boards. But - keep the power structures, control systems and narrative about utilisation, motivation, flow and work.\n\nWhen you only change half the cultural web, then you don't really get change.    \nEspecially when you don't do the difficult bits.\n\nSo mostly SAFe transformations are ugly, like you say.",

Teams that succeed spend serious time on backlog refinement, dependency mapping, and having honest conversations about capacity before they walk into that room. The PI planning should be about alignment and commitment, not figuring out what you're actually building for the first time. When teams use Programs for the cross-team coordination between planning sessions, they tend to show up way more prepared and the actual planning becomes much more focused.  \n  \nAfter about 18 months, most organisations either figure out how to make SAFe work for them or they start scaling it back to something more manageable.

There was no adjustment for ticket size so a 1 point ticket was the same as an 8 point ticket.  \n\nI told my PM that if they wanted to measure me like that il do less work so nothing is left open at the end of a sprint and instead of making 1 x 8 point ticket id break my work down into 8 x 1 point tickets.  There would be less work done but on paper id be 10x the output of anyone else and our team would look amazing. \n\nIn your case id make every function have a 3 line comment explaining what it does. Every { and } goes on its own line. Every function parameter goes on its own line.  Plenty of spacing between lines of code.  Etc\n\nLOC goes up everyone is happy you look great and nothing actually improves. \n\nI’ve also seen this go the other way where devs heavily refactor so the metrics show negative numbers for LOC produced which is fun",

The best code change I ever shipped in 25 years of building banking systems was deleting 3,000 lines. It made the system faster, more maintainable, and easier to debug. Under a LOC metric that would have counted as negative productivity.\n\nThe fact that they want to track authorship too tells you this isn't about improving anything. It's about blame assignment disguised as performance management. When something breaks they want to know whose name is on the commit.\n\nHere's what actually happens when teams measure LOC: engineers pad code instead of refactoring, nobody wants to delete anything because it looks like negative output, and the codebase bloats until it becomes unmaintainable. You optimize for the metric, not for the product.\n\nThe real question isn't whether you're in trouble. It's whether your leadership understands what engineering productivity actually looks like. And measuring lines of code in 2026 tells you the answer is no.\n\nIf your team is running Scrum but leadership is layering LOC tracking on top, that's not Agile. That's surveillance with a standup.",

          "text": "A few thoughts:\n\n* Agile included the concept of a self organizing team for a reason. Do you understand the reasons? Do you agree with them?\n* A specific case, Scrum, provides the role of Scrum Master to support team, remove roadblocks, etc. A SM is deliberately a role with no authority, so as not to undermine the autonomy of the team. \n* A team manager is often a corporate necessity, not a team necessity. \n* Corporate reasons for the existence of a manager often boil down to having one neck to choke. In more sane organizations you also need someone to form budgets, handle HR tasks such as reviews and salaries, oversee hiring decisions, equipment and software purchases, etc.\n* On to your questions:\n   * If a developer is stuck, I would expect them to reach out to the remainder of the team to help them become unstuck. I would expect the other members of the team to stop what they are doing and address the issue. It may not require the entire team, but I expect the team to do something about it. \n   * Does the tech lead step in first? Who cares? Sure. But why not someone else? \n   * Does the engineering manager monitor and intervene? Monitor sure. Intervene? That's trickier. For something as simple as a team member being stuck, I would consider it a failure if a manager needed to get involved. \n   * How do you balance autonomy and accountability? Command and control is not really accoutability. If I'm on a team and I want to get shit done, I hold myself accountable and I hold my teammates accountable. \n* Let's cut the bullshit for a sec. Assuming you're on a half way competent team, what exactly are you expecting the manager to do for you? If the manager is the technical resource you need to unstuck a developer you have a bigger problem than you think. \n* A good Scrum Master, to use as an example, should be working to make themselves unnecessary. In that sense, so should a good engineering manager. \n* There's an old agile model for team maturity: Forming-Storming-Norming-Performing. Interventions by a manager (or SM for that matter) need to be made in the context of where the team is maturity wise and balance the risks of intervening and preventing the team from learning. Sometimes you may have to take the wheel when the team seems intent on driving into a bridge abutment. Or do you? That depends on your context.",

Create focus time.  \n  \nYou should also be working your teams through the selling-telling-coaching-delegating arc, and getting to the point where they can make decisions.

Support their decisions when you do this. \n\nIf there's \"heavy lifting\" work to do then turn off notifications, and use the \"Pomodoro Technique\" to allow for the brain's recharge cycles.

And those are actually good.  \n\nBreak something complex into small pieces and build one piece at a time. Get feedback early instead of building the whole thing and hoping it works. Talk to each other every day about what's stuck. When something doesn't work, figure out why and change your approach.  \n\nThat's it. That's the useful part of Agile stripped of all the corporate scaffolding.  If you want to make it practical, give them a project. Something they can actually build in a few hours. A simple app, a website, a game, whatever fits their skill level. Split them into two groups. One group plans everything upfront for an hour then builds. The other group builds in 30 minute cycles, checking in with you as the \"customer\" between each cycle to see if they're on track.  \n\nDon't tell them which approach is \"agile.\" Let them compare results at the end. They'll figure out the lesson themselves. That sticks way longer than a slide about the Agile Manifesto.  \n\nThe worst thing you could do is teach them Scrum vocabulary. The best thing you could do is teach them how to think in small bets and fast feedback. That's a life skill, not just a work skill.",
