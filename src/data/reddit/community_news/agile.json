      "text": "Yesterday was the 25th anniversary of the Agile Manifesto. The CEO of PMI posted a celebration on LinkedIn and announced a new product: the Manifesto for Enterprise Agility, launching March 3rd.\n\nIn his post, he shared a stat: 85% of executives say agility is critical, but only 32% are satisfied with implementation. A 53-point gap.\n\nI have a small page that critiques Agile frameworks. 5 followers. I left a comment asking a simple question: if the original manifesto couldn't close this gap in 25 years, what does a new one offer that the previous ones didn't?\n\nNo links, no pitch, no product, just a question using his own data.\n\nHis first response: \"I don't think you got the point. It's NOT about software development.\" Except his own post opens by celebrating the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and how it revolutionized software development, the software context was entirely his.\n\nI pointed this out politely and repeated the question.\n\nHis second response (edited before posting): \"You don't seem to understand, or you pretend not to understand. Please promote your services directly without using me or PMI.\"\n\nFive followers, zero links, zero services mentioned. Just one question about his own data. Then my comment pointing out the contradiction was removed.\n\nI have screenshots of the entire interaction, the post is public, everything is documented.\n\nNot sharing this to complain, sharing it because the response pattern is exactly what the Agile industrial complex does at every level: when you question the framework, you become the problem. The question never gets answered.\n\nStill waiting for someone to explain what manifesto number six offers that the first five didn't.\n\nAnyway, has anyone else had this experience questioning the Agile establishment publicly?",

          "text": "Oh I know the answer to this! The head of PMI knows nothing about any of this. This new manifesto was created by clever people - but not him. So he reacted from a place of (slight) arrogance and (lots of) fear. Uncertainty is scary after all. \n\nBTW The PMI are as agile (and indeed Agile) as the least agile thing you could imagine. A large concreted block of concrete, concreted into some more concrete.  \n\nThis new endeavour is an attempt to revitalise the PMI Agilealliance. The non-profit that was originally set up by many of the original manifesto authors to advocate for agile ideas, methods and principles. It funded itself via its large Agile conference Agile20XX which due to Covid, the changing world etc has now failed to generate any profit (indeed costing millions) and so the AA had to find a partner/owner to support them otherwise they would have perished. \n\nThey were effectively consumed by the PMI and the PMI are now working out what to do with this new potential product set. \n\nBTW It's worthwhile not treating the \"agile industrial complex\" (an utterly ridiculous phrase and idea) as one whole thing. It's a series of organisations with very different drivers, needs and wants. It's definitely worth your while understanding the difference and analysing it. It would help with any critique you would like to make. \n\nIn this case, you, a person with an obvious grudge to share but no followers or indeed weight, went after someone of huge \"heft\" but zero agile knowledge. Neither of you have come out looking very good. As someone who likes Agile but hates this direction - I think I'm left happy. 😃",

A nobody account asked a question using the man's own numbers and got accused of self-promotion and had their comment deleted. You literally just said he has \"huge heft but zero agile knowledge.\" That's... exactly what I said. We're arguing the same thing here.\n\nAnd look, call \"agile industrial complex\" ridiculous if you want but when the inventor of Scrum tells me 65% of teams fail and blames the users, somebody needs to name the elephant. Open to better names.\n\n\"Neither of us came out looking good\", fair. But only one of us deleted the other's comment.",

So many of these surveys treat the executives as a demigod who wants X, Y, and Z instead of the flawed human beings that they are who are ACTUALLY responsible for modeling and structuring the organization that they want. \n\nOr in other words, if execs area unhappy about agility, what the hell are they doing about it?

Government can do that. Old companies and monopolies can do that. Utilities can and should do that. When there isn't much pressure to change these things can all be acceptable.

No-one ran CI/CD pipelines from tape.    \n\nA good chunk of the problems people post here are from ignoring those basic values and principles, and wondering why things go wrong, which is a sign of how much the surface \"project management\" frameworks overtook the need for technical excellence.  \n\nEnterprises change direction fast.\n\nThey do this by acquisitions and divestments.   \n  \nWhich means they would rather lay-off 2000 people and by a new company, because it's lower cost and less risk than trying to pivot those 2000 people to a new business domain or market.\n\nWe are seeing this happen, in real time.",

It was an economic response to people becoming more expensive than machines. When your biggest cost was a room-sized computer, you measured twice and cut once. When your biggest cost became developers, you iterated. I've been writing about this for months and never framed it that cleanly. Might steal that if you don't mind.\n\nThe 43 manifestos point is perfect, at some point the format itself became the product. Write values, add principles, sell training. Rinse repeat.\n\nAnd the acquisition point is the real answer to \"enterprise agility.\" Companies don't pivot 2000 people. They fire 2000 people and buy a company that already has what they need. That's the actual enterprise agility. No manifesto required. Just a checkbook and a layoff plan.\n\nYou clearly think about this stuff deeper than most people posting in these threads.

I do think the original Agile Manifesto had a positive impact on software development and on software project management; I adopted Scrum in 2006 and haven't looked back. It certainly is a fantastic lightweight process framework for managing small projects with one or two teams, and Scrum can be extended to be a very powerful and adaptive framework for large projects and programs... I've done it. (I use my own scaling practices, not any of the well-known frameworks.)\n\n  \nI agree: most organizations that have tried Agile transformations have not seen the value. I spent 15 years helping companies... from Microsoft to startups... maximize the benefits of an Agile approach, and had considerable success. Most engagements started with an initial discussion of what the client was currently doing, followed by my simple question: \"Do you want to do Scrum?\" Yes was always the answer, so I'd ask again. \"Do you want to DO Scrum, and not some approximation of Scrum like what you're doing that isn't working?\" That question led to a pause, and then a deeper conversation.",

The problem is the industry scaled the framework without scaling people like you, they sold the cert and skipped the \"deeper conversation\" part.\n\nAnyway I'm curious about your own scaling practices though.

The human bottleneck isn't building anymore. It's reviewing. So the process should optimize for review quality, not build velocity.\n\nKill the backlog, keep a priority list. 5-10 items max, ordered by business value. No grooming sessions, no estimation.

And yet, nothing really moved faster. A few weeks later, the sprint was “busy” but progress felt thin. Not because the team wasn’t capable or committed, but because focus was split across too many “important” items. Over time, a pattern became obvious: When everything is P1, real priority disappears. Teams don’t avoid prioritization because they don’t understand Agile. They avoid it because prioritization forces trade offs and trade offs are uncomfortable, especially when multiple stakeholders are involved. Every story has value. Every request feels urgent. Every delay feels risky. So instead of choosing, we keep adding. What finally changed things wasn’t another estimation technique or a better backlog tool. It was forcing one constraint into the conversation: If only one thing can come first, what actually comes first? That single question shifted the discussion: hidden disagreements surfaced early, scope conversations became clearer, commitment improved because the team knew what truly mattered. Until one thing is clearly ahead of everything else, agility doesn’t increase, execution just becomes fragmented.   \nCurious how other Agile practitioners here handle prioritization when everything arrives labeled “urgent,” especially during sprint planning and backlog refinement.",

Another team had gone so far as to introduce level P0, which moas items then became!\n\nThe solution is at its core - good management.  Organizational skills and process knowledge are good too.   But everyone understands that everything cannot be done all at once, everyone understands team capacity limits, everyone understands the concepts of prioritization and scheduling.   Yet, they find themselves in this situation.   Good management adds “enforcement” of these concepts and, crucially, through persuasion in addition to the logic, gets everyone on board with them.  Not just on board, but on a foundation of understanding such that everyone is happy - happy with how things are going.  That is hard.  Hard, hard, hard.  But good managers do it.\n\nTools that I’ve used:\n\n- like the question you pose - pick one thing - are excellent.   I have had stakeholders bring their top 5, then we hash it out together\n- get ALL stakeholders involved in planning, period.   Do t do it unless all are present.  This prevents the busy C-suite guy from blowing it all up later because he “wasn’t there during planning”\n- Kanban - use the limits in Jira to illustrate, not enforce, how the load is spread and when capacity is reached.  Non-techies will understand this\n- identity “bubbling under” items in the backlog.  These are the ones that come up time and again for inclusion, but never quite make it.  So while everyone agrees that it is clearly a good and important idea, after many cycles, it’s clear that it is in reality not a priority.  After a year or two, it is clear that it is not even needed, since obviously the product is doing fine without it.  The point is - it’s nearly impossible to cull the backlog because yes, all of those are, truly, “good ideas”.  But reality like this illustrates to everyone that much of the backlog is truly NOT top priority, which helps people focus\n- in every sprint and release, have must-have and nice-to-have items.  The latter is a crucial pressure-release buffer.  Stakeholders can get items “in”, but without full expectation.  The dev team gets a win by getting to those items if they can.  Win-win.  Also, as dev manager, I have quietly moved items from must to nice and subtly changed my terminology when discussing it, and no one noticed.  I was able to avoid a couple of real crunches that way, though it is underhanded.",

The framework assumes a power dynamic that doesn't exist in most organizations.\n\nYour constraint question is the right one. \"If only one thing can come first, what actually comes first?\" But notice what happened, the thing that fixed it wasn't a ceremony or a framework. It was a single honest question that forced people to stop hiding behind process and make an actual decision.\n\nThat's the pattern I keep seeing.

If you have that, you'll be able to see a path to reach the goal of the strategy. If you have your path, you can lay out a couple of sprints for yourself to roughly outline what to put in each sprint and when. You'll need stories to reflect the path and you need to know your velocity to have an idea of how long to get there. Then you start actually building a sprint, one sprint planning at a time and you go from there.\n\nBut I also don't really understand your team in the sense that what's ambiguous once the sprint has started? Once it's started, everything in that sprint backlog is P1, it doesn't matter what they pick. All that matters is the value you deliver in 2 weeks time, what order they work on things until then matters absolutely zero so just go ahead and pick.",

The \"everything is urgent\" trap is one of the fastest ways to kill velocity without anyone realising what's happening.  \n  \nWhat we see work well is when teams get really honest about impact vs effort during refinement. Not just \"this is important\" but \"this is more important than X because...\" The moment you have to justify why something ranks above another specific item, the real priorities start emerging. Teams that do this well often end up with maybe 2-3 genuine high-priority items per sprint, with everything else clearly ranked below.  \n  \nThe other pattern that helps is making the cost of context switching visible. When teams track how much time gets lost to jumping between different priorities, it becomes obvious why progress feels thin even when everyone's busy. Some teams we work with literally limit work in progress at the story level, not just at the person level, which forces those uncomfortable but necessary priority conversations to happen upfront rather than mid-sprint when it's too late.",

      "text": "I'm a developer who has been witnessing and participating in all kinds of agile processes in different teams over a decade now and let me say:\n\n**almost everytime it works pretty well.** Which is amazing tbh.\n\nThe teams I've been on always found their way of making their processes work for them. Sometimes you need some little adjustments on the way, but the general acceptance and quality of agile processes was great. I took several mental notes experiencing all the different styles, collecting the \"good\" and avoiding the \"bad\"\n\nBut several years ago, one company failed so hard that it kept me scarred for life. And thats a good thing, because now I really know how bad it can get and what not to repeat.\n\nHere is a little list of traits for you. Be advidsed, this is a very anti-agility way of working:\n\n* No Scrum Master or PM. Sprint planning was a meeting were the principal dev assigned tickets.\n* No team effort to get something finished first. Everything had to be started at the same time.\n* Big tickets and big features. Your ticket -> Your responsibilty. Every Man for himself.\n* A supervising team in another timezone\n\nWhich of course lead to this behaviour:\n\n* You got 4-5 tickets assigned every sprint. If you're stuck, start the next ticket.\n* Stuck all the time, everything was in \"Doing\" because it looked good on reports for stakeholders (shit you not).\n* Dozens of context switches every day.\n* Barely got any help but also couldn't make any decisions on your own (because they later got rejected).\n* Developers should not merge code that wasn't executed (yet). The whole big feature (for all platforms) needed to be finished first.\n* Your code was reviewed by your local team. Then it was reviewed by a supervising team in another timezone, further delaying the merge.\n* Feature branches got stale and rotted 4-8 weeks (multiple sprints) before they got merged.\n\nIt failed so hard, that I already knew early on that this is fucked up beyond repair.\n\nAs a result, it never felt that we were a team or working on something together that makes actual sense. No documentation, no communication, no goals or understanding.\n\nI tried speaking up several times to make some small changes first (i.e. making tickets smaller, more refined and finish one ticket first before starting others) but was never heard. And as a developer who knows that this is not sustainable, it was the worst.\n\nBut yeah, I think some years later, experiencing hell first hand helped me appreciate every other team with a little structure, processes and dedicated roles.

          "text": "I'm a coach and developer, with stints as a manager in there as well. The behaviour you mentioned is quite common, especially in cases where people need to \"appear busy\". And you're completely correct about how ineffective and inefficient it is. Some people and organizations are so used to it that they aren't interested in changing to something different. 🤷‍♂️  \n  \nSomething I *will* say, is that I'm OK with feature branches as long as they only live for minutes to hours rather than days. Because I've worked in so many domains over my career, I totally get that not all teams can use a continuous delivery model.\n\nWith respect to reviews, though, mob programming is by far the most effective way to handle them (because they happen in real time) than any other approach I've seen. The issue there is cultural - is a group willing to try it, and I don't just mean the programmers. To be effective, mobbing needs everyone (every role) that's required to get a piece of work from start to finish. But, if you're saddled with incompatible timezones, then you pretty much have to live with git or Github flow.\n\nI've been lucky, though, to work in a few places that truly \"got it\". The first was back in 1992, long before anything resembling agile methods existed! I was part of a team of 15-20 people and we got shit done. Our management was rather visionary for the time, insisting that the team be co-located with the people who would be consuming our work. We were trusted to do the work and not pestered for updates or ongoing estimates as long as there was tangible progress. When I learned about Extreme Programming in 2000, it resonated with a lot of what we did in that team 8 years earlier.\n\nSince then I've been able to recreate some of that magic. Boiling it all down, those successes came from close collaboration, limiting WIP, insisting on high quality and reflecting deeply and honestly on how we worked.",

A good example of manipulating definitions of \"done\" and \"releasable\" that I mention in my comment. \n\nIf it is a *true Agile*, there is no such thing as high or low quality. It is either *done* or *not done*. Agile has never called for abstract high quality. It should have *just enough* quality to *be releasable*. There is no high and low. It is a yes/no question, plain and simple. Either it is done (100%) or not (0%); no other options. This is actually the key element that creates the ground for inspection, enables feedback loops, and creates enough pressure to keep work limited and completed inside the sprint. If you don't have it *done*, the whole empirical loop falls apart, and you don't have any Agile anymore, no matter how many rituals are played.   \n  \nIf we have to call for an *abstract* quality, it typically means that what we produce is not a *releasable increment*. \n\nThat's an example of *deep* and *honest* reflection regarding quality in Agile. If the team isn't ready to reflect this way, then it fails to demonstrate one of the five values, probably the critical one when it comes to improving: *courage*. \n\nIt may sound not as *comforting* as many Agile teams are used to having this conversation, and if it causes discomfort, it could be a way better signal to run a meaningful retrospective than anything else. \n\np.s.

The responsible traits in my opinionated order of culpability\n\n\\* Building a very big complex product and trying to deliver it all at once\n\n\\* Never talking to customers, only internal \"proxy stakeholders\" who (as it turned out), themselves never talked neither customers nor to the project's sponsors\n\n\\* Teams owning parts of the stack and treating each other as black boxes with interfaces\n\nBasically, the company got tired of sponsoring this project and paying hundreds of salaries without having anything to show for it. The proxy stakeholders kept adjusting and increasing the scope based on their current opinion without any market validation. The project was in constant integration struggles, as teams were expanding their own scope while waiting for other teams for integration, and by the time the other teams were ready, the expanded scope meant that now the other team has to wait.\n\nFrom the inside it didn't look so bad since we reported to the proxy stakeholders faithfully and transparently and we never got back a signal that something's wrong.\n\nA few days before almost everyone got fired from the project, we were sitting with one of the most senior proxy stakeholders who talked our head off for an hour about how we won't release anything without making proper compherensive printed manuals. He was going over font sizes with us like it's a mission critical fact days before everyone was getting fired.\n\nHe had (20 or so years ago) hands on experience with what the product was aiming to automate, so his focus was on the industry standards of his time, completely detached from the current reality (in a later incarnation of the product i did meet some customers and they showed me the locked cabinet where they store printed manuals that are never opened). And of course, completely detached from the financial reality of the whole enterprise, despite the fact that it was his primary responsibility.\n\nIn the end he got promoted and nearly all the engineers fired.

There was no clear goal, no requirements, no design, weak testing and the purpose of it all was really questionable. Just a bunch of developers doing stuff and hoping it fits somehow in the end. \n\nBut I have to say, agile software development is not a process. The framework offers processes that you can use, but you don't have to. Agile SE is defined by the manifesto in the way that:\n\n* People matter over processes\n* You always have runnable software to show\n* You include your stakeholders from the beginning\n* You can quickly respond to change\n\nAnd in retrospect, not a single point was fullfilled. How do 4-8 weeks of rotting branches and waiting for other devs fit into \"respond to change\"? How do you justify starting every ticket simultaneously but after 2 weeks you have nothing done? How do people matter over the process if they get ignored when they object and say \"How about we finish smth first\"? \n\nExactly. ",

          "text": "What's interesting about your list is that almost none of those problems would have been solved by adding a Scrum Master.\n\nNo autonomy to make decisions, that's an organizational power structure, not a missing ceremony. A Scrum Master doesn't fix a supervising team in another timezone that rejects your decisions. A standup doesn't fix \"every man for himself\" when the incentives reward individual ticket assignment over collaboration.\n\nThe principal dev assigning tickets in sprint planning is command and control. But I've seen plenty of teams with a certified Scrum Master where the same dynamic plays out with different vocabulary. The PO \"prioritizes\" instead of \"assigns.\" The sprint goal is technically collaborative but everyone knows what they're working on before the meeting starts. The structure changes. The power dynamic doesn't.\n\nWhat you're describing is something I've been writing about called Risk Management Theater. Processes that perform control instead of practicing it. Everything in \"Doing\" because it looked good on reports. Code review by a supervising team in another timezone that existed to gatekeep, not collaborate. Feature branches rotting for weeks because the ceremony of approval mattered more than actually shipping.\n\nThe process wasn't failing. It was working exactly as designed. To create the appearance of oversight for stakeholders. Not to ship software.\n\nThe teams you worked on later that felt better probably weren't better because they had \"more Agile.\" They were better because someone with authority actually let the team make decisions. That's not a process improvement. That's a power structure change, no certification covers that.",

Not done, nothing to inspect; that's where the whole empiricism crashes.\n2. Thinking that Agile gives the freedom to choose the right tool is a freedom to skip the whole process altogether because we don't want/don't know how to do it. Typically unpleasant or hard things such as risk management or expectation management are the first victims of this attitude.\n\nActually, these two are anti-Agile behaviors if you consider Agile-by-design, but are good examples of Agile-as-it-is-practiced-by-majority.\n\nIf we speak of Agile-by-design, then the weakest point is the declaration of empiricism, which may be (and by many, including some Agile influencers, is) considered that \"only practical experience matters, and we work with any problem domain as if it were an ideal blackbox\". In fact, the efficient way to experiment is the scientific method, where you have a good, well-grounded theory or at least a model that you prove or disprove by a well-designed experiment. Unfortunately, I've rarely seen an Agile team able to design a sprint as an experiment, at least at the level of DMAIC in SixSigma.",

You can try all features free, no card required for 30 days.\n\nApologies for being a corporate shill, but I'm hoping this helps your team and current issues.\n\nOne of the other commenters made a good point though, this may be less a software issue and more an async culture issue.

I found this approach really helpful. We can map out our application focusing on real user value from start to end while gaps and risks are popping up early before we even commit to write a single line of code. Pretty useful in discovery and refinement as well. It works great to define user personas, map out their journeys and build our releases and prioritize user stories. There is even an AI in the tool that saves some time adding details to our user stories as well. StoriesOnBoard really helps us to always access up-to-date information of our projects and sync changes with Jira or Azure DevOps. Our team is a big fan of it. However, you should consider to rethink your workflow to become more efficient. A great tool is indeed comes with benefits but you also need to make sure it is aligned with your needs.  ",

Our biggest challenge was that our BAs and PMs had to context-switch between different UI/UX for planning, which killed our internal efficiency. We do all our high-level discovery, journey mapping, and release slicing in StoriesOnBoard regardless of the client's tech stack. When we are ready to build, we simply sync the map to their specific Jira or ADO instance. This allows our org to have a standardized discovery process even when the execution tools vary.",

We feed it the strategic core of our project. Everything from the product purpose and key features to target users, platform details, etc. We can customize the persona attributes, the AI has a deep understanding of who we are building for and what we aim to achieve. Basically the AI is aware of the context and understands the story map.\n\nIt serves as a discovery partner rather than a replacement for our team. By analyzing the persona details against our project scope, it identifies missing user goals, suggests journey steps we might have overlooked, and spots gaps in the overall flow. Our workflow usually involves mapping the journey ourselves first, then using the AI to uncover hidden opportunities and generate the first draft of story details, Gherkin syntax, and test cases. This drastically reduces manual labor, allowing our BAs to focus on the truly unique and complex aspects of the project while ensuring our documentation is development-ready in a fraction of the time. This approach works really great for us so far. ",

Have your product owner refine stories ahead of time, get initial estimates through async voting (planning poker style), then use your sync time just for the conversations that actually need everyone together - the tricky estimates, dependencies, and final commitment. Tools like Miro or Mural work well for the collaborative mapping piece, and something like TeamRhythm can handle the story mapping and estimation workflow right in Jira if that's where you live.  \n  \nFor retros, the key is making sure people can contribute thoughts before the meeting so you're not sitting in awkward silence waiting for folks to think. Anonymous input helps loads when people are in different comfort zones with speaking up across timezones. The voting and grouping can happen live, but get the initial brain dump done async first.  \n  \nThe biggest thing we see teams get wrong is trying to make everything synchronous when you've got that timezone spread. Accept that some collaboration has to happen in stages, and focus your precious sync time on the decisions that actually need discussion rather than information gathering.",

Yeah, could be true when agility was skyrocketing everywhere.  \nBut let's be real, we're all just numbers to a company. If you have a pure SM job, consider yourself lucky! They might keep you in a mixed SM/PM-type role, expanding your responsibilities, or decide they don't need the role anymore. That's the reality in many places today. And good luck finding a new job.\n\nEdit: I would never consider myself more important than a developer, they create real value $$$ to the company and my role is to help them do that better.\n\nAnd if we're really talking about agility, then we should be ready to adapt.

This just seems like a terrible metric to me. \n\nStory points are meaningless to upper management. Each team in our department is averaging a different amount of story points. We also implemented Agile about 4 months ago, so everyone is still getting the hang off how to point out stories, and breaking stories into appropriate sizes. \n\nI asked them what they hope to achieve with these metrics, and they said that they wanted to demonstrate that \"we're doing agile and getting stuff done.\" Basically they want to justify our existence and try to insulate us from cuts. \n\nSIGH, does anyone have thoughts on better metrics? \n\nFor additional context, this is an infrastructure department that largely does O&M, and has occasional upgrades. There's a lot of help desk type work from customers dealing with issues. A lot of their tasks are upgrading the existing systems to meet compliance and security guidance that's coming from other departments/government.

Or second-level metrics around the speed/lag/delay caused to others? And asynchronous/disconnected benefits or costs (think quality, stability and reliability and associated risks)\n\nUp to this point, you’ll have external metrics that are defined/measured outside the team. A next level might be to derive metrics around the behaviour internal to the team for the teams own use (velocity is one of these, possibly) but from an org/exec level, they should be interesting but useless - outside the team the only thing that matters is impact on the wider organisation. \n\nSuggest reading The Goal, It’s Not Luck and The Phoenix Project.",

Units of work are independent of the people/team doing the work, just as a mile is a mile regardless of who's running it. \n\nIn your world, it might be better just to calculate an 'issue velocity,' i.e., how many tickets your team (not individuals) can process to completion per unit of time (weekly or bi-weekly, whichever makes sense). What makes this useful for your team is that it gives you something concrete to use to assess process changes; if you come with idea to improve the way your team works and implement it, then issue velocity should increase. \n\nLean teams use throughput (the same thing as issue velocity), cycle time (the time it takes for an issue/work item to go through the entire workflow from when work actually starts on it until it's complete), and lead time (cycle time plus the time the issue waits from when it's created until work actually starts). These are three good metrics that can tell you how well you're doing, whether process changes increase efficiency or decrease it, and give you an idea of how long customers have to wait to get issues resolved. They are basic for process improvement, too.\n\nYour team should focus on the Lean metrics, measure them for a few weeks to get a baseline (a statistic of 1 is useless), and then try a process improvement change to see what impact it has on the metrics.\n\nI will tell you that I've worked with many teams (in the hundreds) and used these simple metrics plus techniques from Theory of Constraints and the Kanban Method to double, triple, even quadruple throughput in 90 days.",

We see teams have better conversations when they focus on lead time (how long from idea to customer), throughput (how many items delivered per sprint), and cycle time (active work time). These translate better to business outcomes than abstract story points.  \n  \nFor newer agile teams, I'd also suggest tracking things like how often scope changes mid-sprint, retrospective action completion rates, and maybe simple health metrics like team confidence in their sprint goals. These give leadership insight into maturity and trajectory without the meaningless velocity comparisons between teams.  \n  \nWhat specific outcomes is your leadership hoping to understand with these metrics?

But velocity is a critical metric of teams running sprints. In fact if you are not tracking velocity, then why bother with sprints at all? I take it a step further and teams running sprints should track for a velocity variance of +/-10%. Because if you have a team that has a velocity of 44, but looking at the last 5 sprints if they have sprints of 48, 63, 29, 47, 32, those are wildly different outcomes painting a picture of instability, which would then spring the question, why? was it due to holidays, PTO, or did work get stuck then get flooded, low backlog health.

      "text": "**TL;DR:** Story mapping is a brilliant concept but doesn't scale to large, multi-team programs. I spent several years evolving story mapping into strata mapping, turning it from facilitation art into algorithmic process so I could use maps for both simple, single-team projects and  large, multi-team complex projects with regulatory constraints. Here's why that matters.\n\n# Why I Needed Something Different\n\nIn 2009, I had recently left a role as Group Program Manager running a 100-person product team working on mobile device platform and application software. I'd moved into consulting, helping large companies re-plan and rescue failing projects.\n\nThese weren't small team efforts. These were complex, multi-team programs with distributed workforces, regulatory constraints, and millions of dollars at stake in domains like aerospace, medical devices, financial applications, even silicon chip design. These product domains aren't suitable for continuous releases to customers without extensive testing, because the cost of releasing is very high due to regulatory requirements. If you get a feature wrong, the regulatory requirements alone might take a year to satisfy before the next release. Dumping feature or functional experiments on end users in these environments is bad for business.\n\nThat's when I encountered Jeff Patton at Agile 2009 in Chicago, explaining story mapping on a hallway wall. His approach interested me immediately. I could see the potential. Organizing work around user activities and workflows made intuitive sense. It was far better than the flat, prioritized backlogs most teams were struggling with.\n\nBut I also saw the constraints that would render it ineffective for my needs. It was too team-focused for large, multi-team programs and heavily dependent on skilled facilitation. It wasn't easy to replicate across projects or teams. It was an art, not a process I could teach and then hand to a project team and say \"use this.\"\n\n# The Problem with \"Art\" at Scale\n\nWhen you're rescuing a $50M failing program with thousands of backlog items, hundreds of people across multiple teams, distributed locations, regulatory constraints and hard deadlines, facilitation art hits limits. Three specific problems emerged: skilled facilitators don't scale (I couldn't be in every planning session), maps became \"one and done\" artifacts that gathered dust during execution, and inconsistent approaches across teams made integration nearly impossible.\n\nYet we still needed Agile benefits because large projects invariably have large uncertainty and risk. The answer: approach planning in a truly agile manner that embraces uncertainty and responds effectively to change. That required process, not craft.\n\n# Four Years of Evolution\n\nFrom 2009-2013, I identified and resolved issues as I used variations on story mapping for large projects.\n\nI found that starting with users and benefits (rather than activities) made everything clearer. Stories flowed naturally from understanding user needs. This became the anchor for consistent results across teams. Better yet, Users and Features became natural units for higher-level planning, supporting product roadmaps organized by User and Feature, portfolio planning across products, executive visibility into the forest instead of just trees.\n\nI needed Feature-level boundaries teams could own end-to-end for parallel work. I needed maps that stayed relevant during execution, not just planning. And I needed systematic validation that caught cross-workflow dependencies before development, not during.\n\nBy 2013, this had solidified into strata mapping.\n\n# Returning the Gift\n\nAt the Lean Kanban North America conference in 2013, I again ran into Jeff Patton and sat down for lunch with him.\n\n\"Jeff, why haven't you written a book about story mapping?\" I asked.\n\nHe said, \"Because it's an art, not a process.\"\n\n\"Let me show you my approach to story mapping... how I turned it into a process,\" I replied. I grabbed a napkin and showed him what I'd been developing: an algorithmic approach that made story mapping systematic and repeatable, not dependent on facilitation artistry. A way to turn the insights from his technique into a process that anyone could follow, especially for large, complex projects where you can't rely on a skilled facilitator being in every room.\n\n\"Wow,\" he said.\n\nHe wrote his book the next year.\n\n# Why Process Matters (And It's Not What You Think)\n\nThere's sometimes resistance in agile circles to \"process.\" But process is a tried and true engineering approach for consistency, repeatability, and predictability. This isn't against Agile tenets - it's recognizing that while requirements may be uncertain, consistent elaboration and decomposition approaches reduce ambiguity.\n\nWhen you write code, you follow patterns. You don't reinvent how to structure a class every time. Those patterns are process. They free your mind to focus on the unique problem, not basic mechanics.\n\nStrata mapping provides that same engineering discipline for planning. The process reduces cognitive load by handling the \"how,\" freeing teams to focus on \"what\" and \"why.\" It enables learning because consistent structure makes it easier to spot what's different between projects. It supports collaboration through shared language. And it builds institutional knowledge - new team members learn once, apply everywhere.\n\nThe irony: disciplined process enables more agility, not less. When mechanics are automatic, you respond to change faster.\n\n# Core Philosophy: Understanding Over Plans\n\nScope never changes. Understanding does.\n\nThe scope is \"allow users to log in.\" That never changes. What changes is our understanding that login might mean OAuth, 2FA, SSO, magic links, biometric authentication, or passwordless options.\n\nThis is why planning is more important than plans. We create maps to develop shared understanding. As we learn, we revise our maps continuously. They're living documents, not static blueprints.\n\nTeams I rescued had failed not because scope changed, but because they hadn't created an effective plan that could evolve as knowledge increased. They treated planning as a one-time activity. Plans became increasingly irrelevant while teams devolved into heroics trying to control chaos.\n\nStrata mapping makes planning continuous. The same algorithmic process that creates the map keeps it current during execution.\n\n# The War Room: Making Progress Visible\n\nI spent more than a decade working with product teams to physically create strata maps with sticky notes on big sticky pages during workshops, then moving them to walls reflecting current plans and backlogs. We \"flowed\" Stories and Features across kanban boards, modeling the incrementally emerging product.\n\nAny stakeholder could walk into our war room and see actual progress and implemented functionality. Not a three-month-old plan. The actual current state.\n\nThe power: anything on the \"completed\" side could be demonstrated in the actual product. The map wasn't aspirational. It was operational. It guided teams to successful delivery, gave stakeholders visibility into progress, and established project leadership credibility with executives.\n\nThis taught me something crucial: the map must reflect reality, not wishful thinking. If a Story showed \"done\" but the Feature wasn't demonstrable, something was wrong. The map forced honesty about actual progress.\n\nI'm releasing StrataTree, a SaaS product that virtualizes and digitizes this approach. Tomorrow, it'll include refinement, estimation, management, and forecasting capabilities that make it a virtual War Room, bringing visceral progress visibility to distributed teams anywhere.\n\n# User-First, Not Activity-First\n\nHere's where strata mapping diverges structurally from Patton's approach:\n\n**Patton starts with business activities:** What activities do users perform? What tasks make up those activities? What stories implement those tasks?\n\n**Strata mapping starts with users and benefits:** WHO are we solving for? WHAT benefit do they need? HOW do they get that benefit? (the workflow emerges from this)\n\nWhy does this matter? If you start with activities, you're assuming you know the workflow before you understand the benefit. When rescuing projects, I often found teams had mapped activities, but mapped the WRONG activities because they hadn't started with actual user needs.\n\n# The Fourth Level: Users at the Top\n\nThis leads to the structural difference:\n\n    Patton Story Mapping: Activities → Tasks → Stories (2-3 levels)\n    Strata Mapping: User → Feature → Step → Story (4 levels)\n\nThat User level at the top isn't just organizational. It's what makes everything work:\n\n**Forces focus on WHO:** Every Feature serves a specific User. Every Story traces to a User's need. Prevents solution-first thinking. Enables validation: \"Does this help this User?\"\n\n**Creates boundaries for parallel work:** Team A owns Features for User 1, Team B owns Features for User 2. Clear swim lanes, minimal coordination overhead. Essential for coordinating 5-10 teams on large programs.\n\n**Provides stability as understanding evolves:** Users don't change. Features might split or merge as you learn, but the User anchor prevents scope creep disguised as \"new requirements.\"\n\n    [User 1: Product Manager]    [User 2: Developer]\n              |                             |\n    [Feature A: Manage Backlog]   [Feature B: Track Work]\n              |                             |\n    [Step 1][Step 2][Step 3]      [Step 1][Step 2]\n      |       |       |             |       |\n    Story   Story   Story          Story   Story\n\nThis hierarchy makes the process algorithmic and replicable across teams.\n\n# What's Coming Next\n\nIn a future second post, I'll walk through the six-step algorithm:\n\n1. Identifying Users (algorithmic prioritization)\n2. Identifying Features (benefit-driven)\n3. Designing Workflow with Steps (with \"square map\" validation)\n4. Breaking Down into Stories (context-driven)\n5. Prioritizing and Drawing MMF Lines (the key differentiator)\n6. Cross-Step Dependency Validation (the genius part)\n\nEach step has clear questions, outputs, and validation checks. No facilitation required.\n\nThen in the third post: the two slicing patterns, delivery vs deployment vs release, scaling to large projects, and keeping maps alive during execution.\n\n**This is story mapping evolved for the complexity of modern product development.**\n\n**What's been your experience with story mapping? Does it stay relevant during execution for your teams, or does it become a \"planning artifact\" that gets forgotten? Have you tried to scale it beyond single teams? Please share your experiences.**",

For instance, we may have a Product Owner who has the need to manage a backlog, and an Engineering Manager, who might want to assess throughput across her teams (these are just example users/scenarios). The Engineering Manager might also want to be able to view backlogs from ADO/Jira as maps, so they'd use the same functionality as the Product Owner to do so. In this case the Engineering Manager is proxying the Product Owner for purposes of functionality. Similarly we may have an uber-Product Owner (I call this role the Chief Product Owner) for a large project with many teams, with each team having a team-level PO (I call this role the Product Owner delegate), but they'd use the same functionality in a similar manner.\n\nPart of the process of identifying users is to brainstorm all possible users, then group them in clusters based on similar use of the product before distilling the group down to a single user role (User).",

The most effective teams she process and metrics and sort of just keep delivering whatever comes their way. I worked on one such team and it was the best five years of my professional life. We used a lite kanban with just enough scrum to keep leadership off our backs, every story was a zero or a one story points to simplify planning, there was no team lead or authoritarian style power structure on the team every decision was a discussion, consensus, and even if the team went a way I didn’t like I could trust my coworkers’s competence was high and intentions were good.\n\nProcess and metrics have cost. That cost only provides value if the team cannot thrive without them. Accept and embrace process when you need it but strive to shed it wherever you can. ",

Engineers live in Jira, stakeholders live in Slack, and I'm stuck translating between them.\n\nTypical flow: Customer issue comes up in Slack. Discuss it with stakeholders. Everyone agrees it's priority. I go create Jira ticket, trying to capture all the Slack context in the description. Engineer picks up ticket, has questions, asks in Jira comments. I go back to Slack to clarify with stakeholders. Back to Jira with answer. Ticket gets implemented but slightly off because some nuance from Slack discussion didn't make it to Jira.\n\nThe context loss is real. Jira ticket says \"improve dashboard performance\" but the Slack thread has the actual customer pain story that makes it clear which performance issue matters. Engineer optimizes the wrong thing because they're working from the Jira description not the full context.\n\nTried linking Slack threads in Jira but nobody clicks links. Tried having engineers join Slack discussions but they (reasonably) don't want to monitor Slack for context they need to do their jobs.\n\nFeels like there should be a way to have product discussions in Slack close to customers and stakeholders while engineers work in Jira, but right now that boundary creates constant friction and information loss.",

          "text": "This is a process issue.  Leave the conversations where they naturally are - non-tech in Slack (they won’t likely use Jira comments, or use them well they’ll just add confusion - the non-tech discussion usually includes much scope creep, other possibilities, totally extraneous comments, and is distracting to the engineer).  Link to the Slack conversation, but don’t RELY on that link.  The ticket itself should be self-contained with all of the agreed-upon-by-the-stakeholder goals, a proper Definition of Done.  Concise, clear, and a good target for the engineer.  \n\nWhat’s needed is some official direction IN THE TICKET to review the Slack conversation at the start of work.  This will give the engineer that context, and work out what’s distracting and what’s useful.  It also captures any truly IMPORTANT nuances on the conversation that may affect the definition of done, or the estimate, or the scope.   That conversation, though distracting, is often important this way.  Beyond this, the engineer is to follow what the ticket says.  The Slack convo is just a resource feeding that, it itself is not authoritative.  Be sure everyone understands this - if it’s not in DoD it’s not enough that it’s in the convo.  And, give them pathways to get it into the DoD. Also - the Slack convo is often very good for designing the QA tests, but again - it is not the system of record for those tests. \n\nWith the stakeholders, be clear about this.  They need to agree the Definition of Done, and agree that the slack is not authoritative, especially after work starts.  Should something vital come up, they need to sound a bigger alarm and not just add to the convo.  Standups, sprint planing meetings, etc. - these are the times to nail down the DoD. \n\nFinally, YOU need to keep up on the conversations and make sure all of this is being followed, that the information is flowing where it needs to go.  Ultimately good habits will be built, and there will be clarity all round.   Bells will sound, angels will sing, the sun will shine brightly…\n\nTLDR - organize your process around the ticket being the ironclad authoritative system of record, and get everyone focused and clear on that.",

The events are actually what become the user stories in jira, not the use case. Your end to end testing is just applying the use case to your string of user stories to make sure you get the result expected. \n\nYou said you just take the requirement from slack and put it in one user story? No wonder there are gaps. Why just one story, when a request may have several parts? You may need a DevOps story to create a table, and a backend story to develop an API for it. And then you’ll finally have your frontend implementation. So one request, if it’s net new, is a minimum 3 stories",

The post distills 21 hard-won lessons: start from user problems rather than cool technology, prioritize collective alignment over being right, ship imperfect work to learn from reality, write clear code instead of clever code, and treat novel technology choices as scarce \"innovation tokens\" best spent only where you uniquely must innovate. It emphasizes that your code won't advocate for you — people do, so make your impact legible. At scale, even bugs become dependencies users rely on, and most slow teams suffer from misalignment, not lack of effort. Writing and teaching sharpen your own understanding, glue work is vital but must stay visible and bounded, and every metric exposed to management will eventually be gamed (so pair speed metrics with quality ones). Admitting what you don't know builds psychological safety, your professional network outlasts any single job, and most performance gains come from eliminating unnecessary work rather than optimizing what remains. Process should reduce uncertainty, not create paper trails, and eventually time becomes worth more than money. The throughline: expertise compounds through deliberate practice, and a long engineering career ultimately revolves around people — the users you build for and the teammates you build with.\n\nIf the summary seems inacurate, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually 👍\n\n[^(Click here for more info, I read all comments)](https://www.reddit.com/user/fagnerbrack/comments/195jgst/faq_are_you_a_bot/)",

There Story points are a measure of effort.\n\nFor some, story points represent the value added to the product more than the required input. Bug fixing is not value addition, it is value repair. Hence there is no need to add story points. So fixing bugs means you sacrifice value addition for value maintenance. Often teams then also dont give story points to things like package updates and other tech maintenance work.\n\nMy personal preference is to only give story points to bugs and maintenance when the team needs it to determine if we have space to fix a bug in a coming iteration while also still moving the work on our product goals forward, and not to add story points to bugs that are found and quickly fixed within the current iteration. \n\nAs long as these work items are a clearly different type of item than normal value creation tasks, both sides are pleased. That way you can have both the measure of effort and planning number, as well as a way to measure what you add in value and what you need to spend to keep the product as stable as possible.",

If you're in charge, there are many, many better ways of doing this that don't involve your engineers sitting around writing interactive fiction for product managers who cannot answer the question of \"what is the single most important thing to do?\" where they could instead be spending time building the damn thing.\n\n2) if you've ignored that, and are using them anyway, then at least don't use them for bugs.  \n\nThere is an idea that story points track work towards the improvement of the product and is used to predict the future.  Bugs are work items for which that improvement has already been claimed and not actually delivered.  Bugs absorbing effort and receiving no score and thus reducing velocity for it is therefore a \\_correction\\_ in the score and in theory will lead to better predictions in the long term.",

I do understand that they try to teach you to follow rules, because that's the easiest way to get started in anything new, but they should say that. Just follow scrum until you understand the rules, then eventually you start bending them and not even needing them (Dreyfus model of skill acquisition).\n\nUsing story points is closer to heresy because even the inventor of story points said they were a stupid idea. In history they've just been used to get management off developers backs because managers want time estimations and developers don't want to, so they invented this abstract notion of complexity + time that makes no sense.\n\nBug tickets don't need story points. User stories don't need story points. But a bug ticket is an investigation. It's a bug of an unknown origin. You have no idea what's wrong. Why guess points for a ticket that you have no idea how to solve until you dig into it?\n\nBut in the end if it works for the team, use them. If they don't, don't use 'em.

The fix itself is usually tiny in comparison. It's impossible to meaningfully estimate an effort that can take anywhere from minutes to days.\n\nAlso unlike new fuctionality (where you generally have a working process and just want to transition to a more convenient process) bugs can have much more significant business impacts. If there is a fire and you have to evacuate the building, you're not going to estimate how many story points that's going to consume.

This often leads to reduced focus due to hidden work in progress and a chronic underestimation of the maintenance workload, while at the same time stakeholders draw incorrect conclusions from the reported metrics, which as a consequence causes unnecessary friction. And yes, this becomes particularly problematic in scaled organizations, where metrics and reports are often a more dominant indicator of project and team health than direct input, contextual understanding, or a realistic assessment of actual capacity and outcomes.\n\n**TLDR**: If bugs consume sprint capacity but are not reflected in planning, velocity becomes misleading, hidden WIP increases, and stakeholders draw incorrect conclusions. Estimating bugs work makes maintenance visible, protects forecasting, and prevents chronic overcommitment, especially in scaled organizations where metrics drive perception.",

You'll find that many companies struggle to get stuff out on time, hit their commitments etc. \n\n\nYou'll also find many bugs come up regularly from code that has nothing to do with what they're working on at the moment. Like production incidents for example.\n\n\nDev teams that tend to be off track with their commitments often correlate with teams that are not sizing and prioritising their work correctly (or at all). It also correlates with greater dogmatism and purity about \"how things should be done\" and \"the best teams (allegedly) do this so we should do this\".\n\n\nPeople over process. Of course you don't need to estimate every damn bug there is. What I was saying here that I think a hard-line policy of attaching 0 points to a bug is an anti patterns which I've seen play out in practice more than one time.\n\nBack in the days when I was a lead developer, our rule of thumb was say - if the work e.g. refactoring or I guess bug fixing (we didn't have so many of those) was going to take half a day or more, we would factor that into (sprint-level) planning.\n\n\nAnd I've had arguments with product where the amount of time all the various people involved have spent debating e.g. should we upgrade React etc took more capacity and time from those individuals than actually doing the work would do. \n\n\nYou just need to be sensible about these things. But one of the most recent senior engineering managers who reported to me had a \"we don't point bugs\" rule and on the legacy undocumented codebase his team were responsible for maintaining (without even being familiar with the languages), guess what - this policy made no sense and that team were barely getting anything across the line (while signing themselves up to all sorts of other work).\n\n\nPick the context that works for your team.\n\n\nBut don't let dogmatism and purity of principles get in the way of doing \"the right thing\", whatever that may be for that team in that org.",

          "text": "**Condensed version:**\n\nThe engineering manager role has no standard definition — it shifts based on team size, whether a PM exists, and where bottlenecks sit across product, process, people, and programming. Everyone on the team must care about the product because code only matters when it delivers user value, and teams that understand the problem (not just the spec) can pivot when needed. Processes should earn their keep or get cut; ceremony bloat creeps in when no one questions whether a ritual still improves delivery. Communicating down demands transparency — withholding information that affects your reports causes lasting resentment — while communicating up demands a clear structure: context, problem, plan, and what support you need. A manager's time breaks down roughly into 10% player, 30% coach, and 60% cheerleader, with genuine (not ritualistic) praise and making engineers' wins visible beyond the team. The ultimate goal is building a team that thrives without you: delegate relentlessly, stay off the critical path, refuse to become the bus factor of one, and trust your people's effort and honesty while still verifying through both quantitative metrics and the qualitative signals — like who quietly holds the team together — that no \"management AI tool\" can capture.\n\nIf the summary seems inacurate, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually 👍\n\n[^(Click here for more info, I read all comments)](https://www.reddit.com/user/fagnerbrack/comments/195jgst/faq_are_you_a_bot/)",

Instead of estimating how long something takes and being wrong, leadership decides how much time something is worth. That's a fundamentally different question and a more honest one.\n\nThe downside is it requires something most organizations don't have: leadership that trusts teams enough to let them figure out the how within the timebox. If your org can't do that, Shape Up will fail for the same reason Agile fails, the culture can't support the framework.\n\nWorth reading the free book from Basecamp even if you don't adopt it.

              "text": "I've had tremendous experience with Scrum and Kanban, and have read the book on Shape Up. I think the contrast between Scrum and Shape Up is really a contrast in how many people (incorrectly) implement Scrum.\n\nA team is going to produce as much as it can over a fixed duration using a specific process/approach, regardless of their specific process. Shape Up says that these 6-week commitments will be made 'as a matter of honor.' I don't buy that. What I don't like about Shape Up is, I won't know how the teams are doing against the plan until the 6 weeks are up; with Scrum and running two week sprints, I know in 2 weeks whether we're ahead, on, or behind our predicted schedule. Not so I can beat the team up, but so I can update forecasts, adjust planning, etc. \n\nIn real life, much of the functionality we want to build for a new product, or a new release, is necessary, so how much time it's worth is irrelevant... if you need it you need it regardless of how much time it takes. Getting it done, quickly and efficiently is what matters. What happens if the leadership decided that something is worth 6 weeks, the teams spend 6 weeks working on it, and it's not done? If it's truly worth it, you spend another 6 weeks! Really, this 'how much time' question is about setting priorities, not scope.\n\nWhen people mention the unnecessary overhead of Scrum, I shake my head. Scrum done properly, running 2-week sprints, has about 4 hours over an 80-hour work period... about 5% of overall time. If done correctly, this doesn't even take away actual working time. Most people come into the office (or start work) by grabbing a cup of coffee, checking their email, maybe a quick chat with coworkers... and then they start their work period. Have your daily Scrum 15 minutes after the beginning of work hours and get it over quickly... 10 to 15 minutes MAX... and then people can come to work, grab a coffee, quickly check their email, and go to the meeting, and be heads down and working a half hour after the start of the day. If that little bit of overhead destroys your productivity... well, I don't believe it.\n\nIs Shape Up better than dysfunctional Scrum. Surely. But, why not follow a functional optimal Scrum process instead?",

Most of the challenges I’ve seen have come from lack of trust during the execution phase, or misalignment from the planning phase. \n\nMy (biased) opinion is that shape up is hugely beneficial to almost any midsized org with a mature software product. The cycle times alone become a real challenge if you’re doing a greenfields project so you need to be at a stage where a 4-6 week cycle feels about right to deliver an impactful piece of work. \n\nShape Up will usually fail at places with low trust, or a large number of junior employees. By nature, you’re leaving people alone to do their work for long periods of time, so if the requisite cultural pieces aren’t there then you’ll have major challenges. \n\nI’m happy to ramble about shape up for days.

That means you can use valuable working software as a probe to uncover the actual needs of users, because if you are wrong, it's not expensive, hard, slow or risky to change it.\n\n**2.  Theory-X management need not apply.**  High performance comes from unlocking intrinsic motivation of teams - broadly that means STOPPING the things that demotivate them or mean they are disengaged as a start point.  You need to lead, not manage.\n\n**The key shift in thinking is away from scope, budget and time.**\n\nEach Sprint/Iteration is a small project, where you create (and measure) benefits created so far, and check the assumptions made when you started.  You can extend scope, pivot to a new direction, or decide to end now and give the team a more valuable project to work on, based on what you now know.\n\nIn that sense scope, budget and time are all flexible, and you opt to invest one Sprint at a time, and review what to do next with all of the stakeholders.   The goal is not efficient delivery, but enabling \"off ramps\" from the programme  that have zero cost, every few weeks.\n\nAgile methods were called \"lightweight\" for this reason.",

Continuous deployment means just that.  XP has an onsite customer, embedded with a team, co-creating. Scrum suggests you aim at multiple increments released in a Sprint, to get feedback on the Sprint Goal.   \n  \nIn general that's my starting point - do we tick those three boxes?  \nOr, can we get there. \n\nIf not, then you are in that contractual, avoid-being-the-scapegoat space.  \nWhich means slow, bloated bureaucratic waste, so everyone feels safer.",

Agile is also not a methodology, it's a way of thinking expressed in principles that emphasizes improving the ability to respond effectively to change. Most people who say they're \"doing Agile\" are actually using some form of Scrum (that may be more or less faithful to the Scrum Guide).\n\nSAFe (Essential SAFe, the first level of the framework and the one that is most-implemented) is a framework that sits on top of the teams and is meant for large multi-team projects. SAFe has its own training for Scrum and Kanban... go to Scrum Alliance, [Scrum.org](http://Scrum.org), or [Scrum.Inc](http://Scrum.Inc), or Kanban University for training in Scrum or Kanban. Although I've had several engagements where I helped organizations struggling with SAFe (I have my own approach to fixing SAFe I call SAFeR), I'm not a SAFe fan. There are better ways to scale... more lightweight, more effective. My own approach, developed in the early 2010s, focuses on a Product Owner Council with a Chief Product Owner, and has a Chief Scrum Master with team-level Scrum Masters. We run two levels of refinement: project/release refinement and team-level refinement. We hold daily Scrums, with the last Scrum being a leadership Scrum (all POs, all Scrum Masters, plus functional leads and managers, facilitated by the Chief Scrum Master) which runs like a Kanban standup. This approach has worked well for me in many organizations and has resulted in significant quality and throughput increases, as well as increased team morale.\n\nXP has mostly been absorbed into Scrum by having its key practices integrated by teams into their Scrum implementations... pair programming, TDD, CI, refactoring, collective code ownership, etc. That makes sense when you realize that Scrum is a team-level project management process wrapper while XP practices are good engineering practices for software development.\n\nKanban (the Kanban Method) is a collection of of practices and techniques based on principles from many different approaches, primarily Lean/TPS and Theory of Constraints, along with some original work on product management, leadership, and metrics. The Kanban Method is orthogonal to Agile frameworks and can be used within, alongside, and above these frameworks. My scaling approach has a lot of Kanban baked in as the glue that aligns and coordinates teams.\n\n  \nRe jargon, you only see jargon among the Agile geeks. I will say that the difference between failing Scrum adoptions at the beginning of my engagements and successful Scrum at the end is the faithful application of practices based on principles and the insistence on facing and fixing problems.\n\n",

The truth of the matter is that we are regressing away from Scrum back to a traditional waterfall model. Our Scrum implementation - like you say - was poor. It did not provide the delivery assurances that the business needed and the project is a late and chaotic mess. We are also reverting back towards a more traditional management model, where the line manager leads the team and is accountable for delivery.

Then they did a tender for supplier which was won by an Indian company, forcing most of the agile senior folks to be pushed out (there would now be supplied by said company). For full context more than 80% of the folks in their out department were external contractors, so this lead to a massive turn over. \n\nUnfortunately, while this new supplier claimed to understand agile development principles and practices, all their new scrum masters were basically project managers or architects; Senior personnel relabeled to satisfy the customers requirements. I was one of the last scrum masters from the old group left to try and help them understand their role (and massive challenge). \n\nI kept in contact with my former product owner. He  told me that 6 months after I had gone there was little left of what we built. A full reset he called it. There were still a few people from the old org trying their best to rebuild but it never really fully recovered from the big reset. \n\nFast forward to today: the company which was once the template for small and competitive telco was sold by its mother company to venture capitalists. Scrum master roles were stripped, and their accountability shifted to the product owner, making them effective project managers. \n\nThe services provided by the telco have declined over time. Recently they were in the news regarding a hack and data leak scandal. While hacks are unavoidable in the long run, the size of the data leak and the sensitivity of the user data feels like something the old company would never have had let happen. Then again I might be biased. \n\nIt’s an immensely sad thing to see all your efforts so carelessly tossed overboard for the sake of chasing lower costs. While the two years I was there didn’t feel like a complete waste of time (I gained a lot of experience) uit sucks to see all the results of your labor being wiped out.",

Makes the work more engaging and interesting, I laugh a lot, and I always learn something new. \n\nI've found the secret to pairing is regular switching of driver/navigator, and the way to do that is so simple...just set a timer (my favorite one: https://chris.dziemborowicz.com/apps/hourglass/) my preference is 15 minutes then switch, but I've found some people don't like that, so I'd say somewhere between 15-25 minutes is a good range. And be diligent at abiding by the timer.

          "text": "Before discussing reducing time, have you defined why you are conducting a code review? There are several reasons: finding defects, developing a shared understanding of a system's design and implementation, identifying enhancements and opportunities to improve an otherwise working system, and exposing implementation details to testers to move from black-box to white-box testing, just to name a few. Code review, and even different types of code reviews, are better at some of these than others.\n\nOnce you know why you're reviewing the code, do you know how long you're actually spending compared to the value you get from that time? If your purpose is to find defects, how many defects are you finding? If your purpose is to develop a shared understanding, are the people who didn't implement that feature comfortable enhancing that feature in the future? Sometimes, value could be hard to quantify, depending on the reason for review.\n\nGenerally speaking, are you focusing on things that need human eyes during code review? Regardless of when or why you conduct code reviews, automate as much as possible. People shouldn't be looking for style problems. Use a linter and automate code formatting and flag anything that can't be automated before the review starts. Expose code coverage, test results, and static analysis to make sure that there is some confidence that the code is tested and does what it is supposed to do without introducing errors. Tool output can also be provided to the reviewers. Sometimes, I've gotten more value from reviewing a description of the proposed change, a test coverage report, and automated unit and integration test cases to identify missing edge cases than from reading the actual implementation code.",

Those aren't the same thing.\n\nThe teams I've seen that cracked this had one rule: nothing over 200 lines gets merged without being split first. Painful to enforce for the first month, then it becomes the fastest thing you do because reviewers actually understand what they're looking at.\n\nThe other thing that helps is separating what the review is for. Architectural decisions should not be made during code review, that's too late, the code is already written. If the approach is wrong at that stage you're not reviewing, you're rewriting. Architecture gets discussed before a line is written. Review is for implementation quality only, and that's a much faster conversation.\n\nThe SLA thing is a symptom of the real problem which is that reviewers have no ownership of what they're reviewing. If I'm assigned 12 random PRs this week I'll rubber-stamp them to close the queue, anyone would. If I own the feature and I'm reviewing the implementation, I have a reason to actually read it.\n\nNone of this is a tradeoff, it's just structure.
