      "text": "Early 2023s, small fintech startup. Deadline: 4 months to launch. Engineering team was literally 3 people. Me as architect, plus two devs. We had our shit together. Architecture designed, infrastructure running in the cloud, backend skeleton ready. \n\nDevs were building features. We were on track. Then month 2 hit and management started hiring. A bunch of managers showed up. Then they brought in a Scrum Master. First week this guy wants to implement full Agile ceremonies. \n\nDaily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives, backlog refinement. The whole package. His reasoning: \"You need process to scale.\" We had 8 weeks left. \n\nWe weren't trying to scale. We were trying to finish. I've seen this same pattern play out multiple times now. Small team shipping. Management gets uncomfortable with lack of visibility, they hire process people. Process people need to justify their existence, ceremonies get implemented and everything slows down. \n\nThe thing that kills me is the timing. We were working. Why fix what isn't broken when you're 8 weeks from deadline? I'm genuinely curious, why can't management just leave working teams alone? Is it actual concern about sustainability or is it just discomfort with not having control mechanisms in place? \n\nWhat's your experience with this?",

Basically say, this is making things worse, what were you hoping to achieve, maybe we can find a way to make that happen.\n\nEssentially, the three different scenarios I've witnessed personally when it came to transitioning to agile all had different reasons.\n\n1. Some form of organization was needed. The company operated in a chaotic way for 10 years or so and got really successful, secured investment to grow even more so their headcount increase was 100% yearly. They were also really bogged down by their previous poor decisions, and were constantly firefighting because of shit code. All the new projects were started agile but the legacy team stayed fucked, once the new revenue channels outperformed the old solutions, they sunseted that product and had a unitary way of working.\n\n2. Company got bought, owners enforced their own ways of working, ended up being pretty average experience, not great, not terrible.\n\n3. CEO got conned by a consultancy firm to hire some consultants to fix something that wasn't broken. 6 months later, they broke the contract because they had no idea how to do that and it was just a massive waste of time. There were like 10 devs total, so there was no need for it, we were shipping everything on time, the product was decent.",

That's essentially what this felt like - consultancy-driven change rather than solving an actual problem. We were shipping, had clear visibility, no firefighting.\n\nThe thing that makes it tricky: when you're the one questioning the change, it's easy to get labeled as \"resistant\" rather than \"concerned about timing.\" Framing it as \"let's find a way to achieve your goals\" is much smarter than \"let's not do this now.\"\n\nOn your scenario #3 - how did you guys eventually get out of it? Did leadership recognize it wasn't working, or did the consultants just run out their contract and leave?\n\nAnd on the metrics point: we didn't have formal velocity tracking (ironically, because we weren't doing sprints yet), so proving slowdown would have been anecdotal.

                  "text": "How did we recognize it wasn't working? There were two teams that were small enough where it was easy to gauge the rate we were going at without measurements. Obviously the consultants came in and started enforcing a bunch of redundant nonsense and the story point system they implemented rather than be used for planning was being used for measuring performance, some people caught on, started overestimating, there was some poker planning where it was hard to land on an estimation because some people wanted to juke the numbers and some didn't. However, those measurements ended up doing them in, about 2 months in, our very clever team lead at the time told the scrum master that we should retroactively add value to completed work so we can have a better sample set for our estimations, they were super hyped for it, so we wasted a bunch of time doing that, and then he used those numbers to calculate our velocity pre-consultancy which was higher than after they joined. Took the numbers to the CEO, the reception was mixed, no action was taken immediately but he didn't dismiss it out of hand, basically ended up saying we'll keep an eye on it. A few months later, the numbers didn't get better and because they had already kind of established velocity as a measurement of performance, that was used as a metric to justify them doing bad work. We moved to some sort of compromise where we did measure some things, kept ceremonies to a minimum, estimations weren't done by commitee but by the leads alone, and there was an understanding that they are used for planning purposes and nothing else. I left maybe 4 months afterwards so I didn't end up seeing how it continued afterwards.\n\nThe key part here is to not wait until shit hits the fan, do your due dilligence, let your line manager know as early as possible, if you can have some way to quantify it, non-technical people love that shit, because they usually have a monetary value associated with the work you are trying to complete so they can translate that to potential losses. After that, if they dig in, wait for shit to hit the fan, that's probably the last opportunity for them to be convinced it's a bad idea. If nothing changes, jump ship, it's not the kind of management you want to work for.",

But still - it needs to match the scale of the rest of the efforts. Rather than this process, the answer might well be something like \"and hire _one_ product person to work with those managers on scope and priorities, and have the team work only with that new person.\"",

Three engineers trying to satisfy five different people simultaneously.\n\nThat's not a process problem. That's an org design problem, no amount of Scrum fixes that.

Ultimately, leadership is responsible for your output so if you don’t do a good job of giving them inputs, they will find another method, hence the Scrum Master. Scrum is a way for leadership to understand the development process in chunks so that they can make strategic decisions when needed. \n\nThe “trust me bro” approach has been tried time and time again by small development teams and it has failed more times than it has succeeded. \n\nIf you’re already feeling the pressure to deploy in 8 weeks, likely the release date is too aggressive. A good SM could and should relay that to leadership, find a way for a compromise to give the development team more bandwidth. When you rush, things break. And while the sentiment of rapid release is common and likely practiced at my small organizations, taking a tactical pause and making the tough decision to delay a release is likely the better move. \n\nAs you scale, yes you will have increased overhead. That is the cost of doing business. If you don’t want leadership poking around into what you’re doing and adding unnecessary headcount, learn their language and garner trust.",

Short feedback loops, almost no ceremony, lots of trust, and the assumption that most early decisions will be wrong and need fixing fast.\n\nThat phase is not about scaling.\nIt is about learning.\n\nXP exists for the moment when requirements are fuzzy, designs are still forming, and speed of feedback matters more than predictability.\n\nYou do not need sprints when your iteration cycle is hours.\nYou do not need backlog refinement when priorities change midweek.\nYou do not need formal standups when everyone already knows what everyone else is doing.\n\nFrom inside the team it feels efficient.\nFrom the outside it looks scary.\n\nThen management shows up and sees no charts, no velocity, no visible control points. Someone says we need process to scale.\n\nExcept you were not scaling.\nYou were trying to finish a prototype with a deadline.\n\nDropping full Scrum ceremonies into that situation does not make the team faster. It stretches the feedback loop. Work that used to flow continuously now waits for planning. Decisions that used to happen in minutes get parked until the next meeting. Momentum slowly turns into overhead.\n\nThe ironic part is that XP is not a lack of process. It is just optimized for discovery instead of reporting.\n\nScrum is great once you know what you are building and need predictability, coordination, and long term planning. XP is better when you are still figuring out what the product even is.\n\nTrying to apply delivery scale process to a discovery stage team does not create maturity. It just replaces progress with meetings.\n\nI have seen this transition work well when it happens later. Prototype fast using XP. Validate the product. Lock in the architecture. Then introduce Scrum once the work shifts from learning to delivery.\n\nBut doing it eight weeks before launch is not scaling.\nIt is hitting the brakes because leadership wants visibility.\n\nSometimes the best thing management can do is recognize that the team is already using the right process and let them keep shipping.",

I work in a very large org, massive global company. \n\nClose to 100 teams in this division. Nothing is agile. At all. It’s project management, six months at a time. Code quality is shit. Practices are 1990s era. \n\nFor me, it’s soul crushing. But what can I do? I have had more success in other companies, and less success. I try to influence people when and where I can. \n\nThey pay me a lot. Management ultimately doesn’t care. They think they are winning, because the product makes a lot of money in a niche industry. Everyone gets a huge bonus. \n\nThe code quality still sucks. Everything is slower and more painful than it needs to be. But the majority of people have never worked for any other company. We’re talking tenures for most people of at least 10 years, and many are 20, 30, 40. They think they are experts. But they’ve never seen software practiced any other way. \n\nEveryone is in a bed of shit. There’s no magic solutions. My chief recommendations to everyone are:\n\n1. Sit down together, everyone, and read the Scrum Guide line by line. Say out loud if everyone agrees with it or not, and if not, write out a replacement. At least then everyone is on the same page - literally. \n\n2. Measure things. But down drown in measurements that don’t matter. We can’t sell estimate points to customers. \n\n3. Be honest, and ask for honesty in return. What does each person really want out of the complex job situation. Safety? More money? Advancement? Improving their skills? Negotiate on what will move the needle for everyone / each person.",

          "text": "So many of the agile ceremonies are theater in a fast moving team when you just have to ship something fast. \n\nI’m on a team that just shipped a pretty substantial clean architected platform in just 90 days. We had to triage how we used our tooling essentially. We were rigid about git obviously, we used a ton of unit tests, we generated a lot of test data too, but we used jira board as little more than a sticky board to grab shit and knock it out. It’s all we could do. We had a year of work to do in 90 days, I’m not exaggerating (we were told a deadline and feature set by a client and it was do it or don’t take the contract no other option). \n\nWe build a really high quality beautiful full featured system to their specs and it just reminds me of how inefficient agile is. But basically we were a team of folks brought in, all the most technical people at the company (they had no one internal to do this) and the architect had a 3 month head start. \n\nThere were a lot of days where I was pushing 1000+ lines of code working 12-15 hour days. It was insanity and I know kloc isn’t a great metric but that’s a lot of code to pump out consistently day after day, so many features, a lot of highly technical code too on my end too while the juniors and mids on the team mostly churned out endpoints using the tools me and the architect wrote. When I wasn’t working I was thinking about the problem. When I take on a mission I’m obsessed with completing it. \n\nWe made it we shipped. Client loves it. \n\nBut here’s the thing…we had to drop almost every agile ceremony but a morning status that was overly technical at parts but brief too thinks offline constantly collaborating with each other to solve the tough problems fast. \n\nAdopting full agile ceremonies would have sunk our timeline: there’s no way we would have made it. It worked for us bc we are all highly technical, experienced folks, highly motivated, they hired the right team and they let us manage our process. \n\nWe are going to now move into more sustainable work going forward (I worked ~300 hours in January as per my timesheet). We have time now on feature enhancements and somehow we ended up shipping a well architected scalable system with really clean code all throughout. \n\nI suspect the agile ceremonies would have maybe not killed our timeline but the quality of code we would have written would have dropped tremendously. We would have been way too fatigued to get our work done as well from the nonsense meetings. \n\nAgile doesn’t have to be heavyweight to add value to what you do. We did sprintsish (it was essentially one big sprint tho), we iterated on things, we documented anything that needed documenting, etc, but we had literally no time for anything but a massive sprint to mvp and just pushing tickets through to testing. \n\nOof I’m exhausted. I would have left if upper management would have done to me what they did to you.\n\nWhen you shake up a team process you need a transition plan to move towards that slowly and figure out what helps and what hurts. /rant",

That's not sustainable and I think that's the other side of this conversation nobody wants to have.

And most importantly, what did stakeholder satisfaction look like?… Because when I hear teams say things like this, its usually because their view of things is quite narrow, I.e. inward focused as opposed to being more outward. Fair play if you were managing those things and I agree, if it is working for the team AND stakeholders are satisfied then the SM should only suggest or recommend changes, and the team gets to decide what is working for them.\n\nBut if an SM was added to the team, this suggests something wasn’t quite working for someone somewhere?

But try not to blame the SM for that, I think you already realise that this is all coming from senior management. But try to remember that they’re only trying to solve a problem that you’re not aware of at the moment.\n\nMy advice is that you should try to initiate the conversations to seek answers to your questions directly with your SM, but do so without aggression and try to be as constructive as you can; collaborate. Try to seek a mutual understanding of each other’s position/perspective and you may discover the underlying reasons for everything that’s going on. In which case, perhaps you can help them solve those problems and in doing so, I guarantee you will all have a much easier time together. Expectations will be reset and all the stress can go away (or at least be directed towards real problems anyway haha).\n\nHave the courage to seek your answers and keep an open mind!",

Just kept heads down coding and assumed shipping was enough. From their side we probably looked like we needed supervision. From our side we were shipping fine and didn't need the interference.\n\nBoth things can be true I guess. We were delivering but not communicating it in a way that made them feel confident. That gap is probably what drove the whole process thing. Being honest we could've prevented a lot of this by just doing better stakeholder management. Fifteen minutes a week explaining what we shipped in normal English probably would've been enough. Didn't think about it at the time though.",

But all too often, you see SMs not willing to understand the actual work, the tech, the product, the outcomes.  it isn't just that you can facilitate and coach.  \n\nI would tweek the things that you say have changed to:\n\n1. they want scrum masters to ALSO be accountable with the team for outcomes - the SM, team, coach, everyone is in it together and if the outcomes are not achieved, ALL of them have failed.  SM and Coaches that focus on form and think that being successful at Agile is the goal... are flat out wrong.\n\n2. product model is more prominent while Agile has become a bad word and a tech thing - the funny thing is that product doesn't mean no Agile... Agile has this thing called a PRODUCT owner.  the notion of a product model becoming the new paradigm is more about the elimination of \"projects\", the continuous planning,, continuous delivery, etc.  \n\n",

Before, everyone was trying to do huge waterfall projects that often burned out dev teams and delivered the wrong project.  It worked.  But when finances tighten, humanity shrinks and I’m afraid we are heading right back to the old days again.  \n\nPlus, we’re in a new phase now in the industry.  Most of the truly groundbreaking systems are kinda like standardized systems now, so requirements are easier to come by.  Agile is really good at discovery and innovation and bringing together diverse stakeholders.  So now, the next gen of software is kinda already specd, and just needs to get ported over to AI. Smart, dedicated developers will be able to do the work better without all the management overhead that Agile Inc became.  Sadly though, those overperformers will lead us right back to sloppy slaughterhouse conditions that many fought so hard to get away from.",

      "text": "Here, on the vast plains of the Q3 roadmap, a remarkable ritual is about to unfold. The engineering tribe has gathered around the glow of the digital watering hole for the ceremony known as Sprint Planning. It is here that we can observe one of the most mysterious and misunderstood creatures in the entire corporate ecosystem: the Story Point.\n\nFor decades, management scientists have mistaken this complex organism for a simple unit of time or effort. This is a grave error. The Story Point is not a number; it is a complex social signal, a display of dominance, a cry for help, or a desperate act of camouflage.\n\nAfter years of careful observation, we have classified several distinct species.\n\n**1. The Optimistic Two-Pointer (Estimatus Minimus)**\n\nA small, deceptively placid creature, often identified by its deceptively simple ticket description. Its native call is, \"Oh, that's trivial, it's just a small UI tweak.\" The Two-Pointer appears harmless, leading the tribe to believe it can be captured with minimal effort. However, it is the primary prey of the apex predator known as \"Unforeseen Complexity.\" More often than not, the Two-Pointer reveals its true, monstrous form mid-sprint, devouring the hopes of the team and leaving behind a carcass of broken promises.\n\n**2. The Defensive Eight-Pointer (Fibonacci Maximus)**\n\nThis is not an estimate; it is a territorial display. The Eight-Pointer puffs up its chest, inflates its scope, and stands as a formidable warning to any Product Manager who might attempt to introduce scope creep. Its large size is a form of threat posturing, communicating not \"this will take a long time,\" but \"do not approach this ticket with your 'quick suggestions' or you will be gored.\" It is a protective measure, evolved to defend a developer's most precious resource: their sanity.\n\n**3. The Ambiguous Five-Pointer (Puntus Medius)**\n\nThe chameleon of the estimation world. The Five-Pointer is the physical embodiment of a shrug. It is neither confidently small nor defensively large. It is a signal of pure, unadulterated uncertainty. A developer who offers a Five-Pointer is not providing an estimate; they are casting a vote for \"I have no idea, and I am afraid to commit.\" It survives by blending into the middle of the backlog, hoping to be overlooked.\n\n**4. The Mythical One-Pointer (Unicornis Simplex)**\n\nA legendary creature, whose existence is the subject of much debate among crypto-zoologists of Agile. Sightings are incredibly rare. The legend describes a task so perfectly understood, so devoid of hidden dependencies, and so utterly simple that it can be captured and completed in a single afternoon. Most senior engineers believe it to be a myth, a story told to junior developers to give them hope.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOur research indicates that the Story Point has very little to do with the actual effort required to complete a task. It is a complex language of risk, fear, and social negotiation, practiced by a tribe that is being forced to navigate a dark, unmapped territory. The entire, elaborate ritual of estimation is a coping mechanism for a fundamental lack of visibility.\n\nThey are, in essence, guessing the size of a shadow without ever being allowed to see the object casting it.\n\n\n\nThought we could use some humor to start the week (this is all tongue-in-cheek ).  If I have overstepped, please let me know and I will take this down.",

The problem is well defined and small in scope (I say problem here, not solution, a story describes your users work, not your work).\n\nIf it's \"Too Fucking Big\" then the team understands the problem to be solved but feels that the problem is too large and needs to find ways to split it into more manageable problems of smaller scope, looking for a smaller MVP. \n\nIf it's \"No Fucking Clue\" then the team has no clear understanding of the scope of the problem and some investment must be made to investigate the problem space and come up with next steps. Some testing and iteration need to occur to determine what an MVP and the next iterations should even look like.\n\nThe goal is to have every story be a 1, if it's a 1 it's ready to be worked on, if it's one of the others, work needs to happen to make it a 1 (or more accurately to define multiple 1's). The main priority is to \"right-size\" the stories and get them feeling fairly uniform, with them all focused on defining a user-facing problem to be solved.\n\nThen to measure the teams performance and make estimations of projected performance it becomes just a matter of counting how many stories are completed within a time frame, how long stories stay in different phases of work, how many stories are waiting on being done, etc",

I then went online to find software to try it with, but there wasn't anything free, so I built my own: [https://www.storymaps.io/](https://www.storymaps.io/) \\- it's free and open-source - no sales pitch. I'm pretty new to the subject myself, so I'm wondering if people in the same fields would find a tool like this useful. Also, if it's not useful or something is wrong or you think it sucks because of a, b and c... I'm all ears! \n\nI really see value in the technique, so I wanted to build a free tool to let people experiment with it and use it in their own day-to-day work as I do myself. \n\n  \nThanks in advance! \n\n  \n,",

But the more I read the descriptions, the more confusing it got.\n\nSome companies describe it like a classic Scrum Master (facilitating ceremonies, removing blockers, coaching teams). Others make it sound closer to a Project Manager (timelines, stakeholder updates, delivery tracking). And a few even mix in things like value measurement and business outcomes.\n\nSo now I’m wondering what this role actually is supposed to be.\n\nOn one team I spoke with, their Delivery Lead basically handled cross-team coordination and stakeholder management while the Scrum Master focused only on team health. On another, it sounded almost identical to a PM with an Agile label. Feels like every company defines it differently.\n\nPart of me thinks this might just be title inflation. But part of me also wonders if it’s becoming a natural “next step” role as teams scale beyond just Scrum Masters and POs.\n\nCurious how it works in your org.",

It’s not the “Scrum Masters” but the person/org on how the implement it.\n\nI started of my career as a Junior Dev, and my Scrum Masters was A Hole. He constantly taunted us (team) like, he would come sit next to us and asked, explain the code and what it does or why is it not working (Idk haven’t had a chance to debug yet). One time he accused of manipulating the user story when I was talking to the QA engineer to explain the testing scope as he was new to the team, he straight. I’ve asked if I was asking the QA to manipulate and move the story forward - that’s where I come from.\n\nI hate confrontations so never said anything and decided to quit being a dev which I wasn’t a fan of so I became a Scrum Master and have been for the past 7 years now. I did this to become everything he was not and be the best and a dependable team member.\n\nReading through your post - it looks like they are just doing “Scrum” or “Agile” just for the sake of doing it. Scrum Masters are there to help, guide and support the teams without any disruptions.\n\nAnyone can share the screen and go through the board, he is not needed per se but he should be there to understand what’s going on and where they are needed.",

I have another scrum master semi guiding me but I feel like he honestly thinks im stupid for not knowing how to do things or getting flustered with tasks that he views as straight forward. I try to ask him to help me as Ive never done any of this and he says i have to \"take initiative\" and that he cant \"hold my hand through it\" this has made me not want to reach out to him as I dont really get guidance, its more of a scolding and a \"you should be doing this and this\" my PO is great and understands I dont have any answers and am just trying to learn HOW things work so Im thankful for him. But I just feel so stupid and useless whenever I try to do things and they end up being \"all wrong\".

In my years as a SM, I didn't have a single day to day routine other than taking on the actions from standup. That meant coaching POs and BAs in writing stories, working with engineers to examine complexity, running through budgets and burn rates with directors, and helping QA learn BDD to leverage tools fully.\n\nThe only thing I didn't do was code - and even then, I was researching logs, engaging support teams, and managing delivery. \n\nSMs serve the team in whatever capacity.

Trust me when I say that Scrum dogma has no practical place in software and product development. Meeting your team where they are and responding to those needs is the mark of a good real world SMs.\n\nIf you want to do this, find a shop that understand and learn there.

Drove strong product growth, and kept us alive in a downtown because we delivered stuff all the time, so people kept paying. Product and team still going strong 16 years later.   \n**Key successes : listening to the team, hiring an experienced senior XP developer to help us out of the mess.**\n\n**-** took over as HoD for a group of about 50;  very much zombie-Scrum and firefighting.  Team and Dev leads overwhelmed, lots of burnout, teams-as-silos stuff.  Got rid of the contract agile coach who didn't know what to do, and sent everyone on \"team member to team leader\" training.  That established a common non-technical footing and team members started to step up.  Within 12 weeks \"it was alive\", culture shift and we started to deliver.  Hit a massive (\"impossible!\") delivery target of a huge new value stream inside 12 months, under budget.  \n**Key success : foundational non-technical and leadership skills pushed them over the tipping point, \"eliminate fear\"**",

Culture change and small wins will spread and become viral fireside \"stories\" that are shared. Top down by mandate transformations are more theater than real change.  The model we went through and I pushed was bottom up and middle out. We had management support but not a mandate other than \"get better at delivery.\" Funny story, one of our agile coaches, who had a corporate mindset, kept complaining, \"why doesn't management send a memo telling everyone you have to go agile, these teams are not doing what they are supposed to!\" This made me laugh because if a coach can't help a team see the value of agile methods for themselves and have THEM buy in, no amount of coercion will result in change. Human beings do what is in their best interest and agile, for most, not all, is in their best interest. An empathic coach who can help them through that process, and it takes time, will create lasting change.",

      "text": "My favorite metric for dev teams is average bug age (ABA), that is, [average age of ***open*** bugs](https://middleraster.github.io/ABA/TheMetricForSoftwareDevelopment.html). With a proper bug-handling policy, it's hard to drive that number down to something close to 0 (and keep it there) without lots of good things happening.\n\nRecently I've heard people assert (without proof) that all metrics are gameable, though lead and cycle times are harder to game.  That's probably true, but I recently started thinking about the mathematics of Little's Law in relation to ABA. Here are my thoughts: [Is the ABA Metric Gameable?](https://middleraster.github.io/mathmusings/ABA/IsABAGameable.html) My conclusion: I *think* it's hard or even impossible to game in a way that's not easily detectable.\n\nMy challenge/ask of you:  if you can think of a way to game the ABA metric, one that I haven't already covered in my posts, please let me know, and if we're really lucky, maybe I'll be able to think of a mitigation.\n\nP.S.:  Before we get started, ***please*** note the difference between [throughput and cycle time](https://middleraster.github.io/Kanban/KanbanThoughts.html): they are orthogonal. (I even wrote a [simulator](https://middleraster.github.io/Kanban/KanbanSimulator.html) to show the difference:  you can easily change cycle time, yet throughput stays the same).\n\n  \n\\--UPDATE--\n\nThank you for your responses. \n\n**1)** There seems to be quite a bit of misunderstanding of my ABA metric. It's the average age of the **open** bugs, For example, (not to pick on her post, but it got the most upvotes) Possible-Ebb9889 said:\n\n1. Discover a bug\n2. Don't tell anyone or put in a jira ticket\n3. Spend a week working on it\n4. Create a ticket when I'm done and checking the code in\n\nThen she claims the ABA for that bug is 0, but *that is measuring something else*, not the average age of the open bugs. \n\nIn my ABA metric, let's suppose that the average bug age of open bugs for her (or her team) was 7 days. She then works on this hidden bug for a week and checks in the fix. At this point, the ABA of the open bugs is now ***14 days:  worse than when she started.*** Not gaming anything:  time is relentless. \n\nThe open bugs age by a day per day, every day. You can't keep that number close to zero unless you can fix bugs quickly and easily, which means having code that is well-factored, simple to understand, well-architectured, with automated tests in place, etc.\n\n**2)** Other people have claimed that closing all the old bugs is \"gaming\" the metric, but I consider closing old bugs a completely appropriate action and is the standard advice for handling old bugs:  if they're really all that important, they'll come back. Again, not gaming anything. Similarly, I'm not claiming every bug has to be fixed; rather, I'm claiming every bug should be fixed immediately or closed immediately.",

Turning that same metric into a KPI can also drive bad behavior in chasing that metric.\n\nI think your example is a good example of how this metric can be a good signal, but chasing it can go bad. ABA is increasing. If it is treated as a signal, an investigation determines that it is because low priority bugs are accumulating and now the team can decide on the best approach to deal with that situation. Treating it as a KPI that drives performance reviews and compensation, and now the team just fixes all bugs ASAP regardless of what other work gets set to the side.

If someone found a new bug, the choice was to fix it immediately (if it was something small) or bump one of the 30 bugs. If a bug keeps cropping up, then it probably deserves to bump one of the 30 bugs.\n\nIt's terribly easy to just add a bug to the giant list of bugs without realizing the overhead of doing so. That oldest bug will be triaged again and again and again. There's no shame in acknowledging that some bugs just won't be fixed. It's not quite so easy to explain to someone that their bug won't ever rise to the top of the queue.",

Legos!  A single, kinda big model that breaks into subassemblies well.  The kids decompose the project, sort into backlog states, and touch base a couple times to update.  Not sure what the timing is on this, probably like 10-15 minute \"sprints\" so you can have a couple. \n\n3. Individual time to lay out all their current assignments into personal Kanbans.  Gives them something to walk away with that hopefully is immediately useful.",

After 30 years of experience, mostly in startups and sometimes as a co-founder, I've learned that juniors can be *more* expensive than seniors.  There aren't enough seniors to mentor and guide them.  Tech debt gets out of control, even with PR reviews.\n\nIf possible, I would avoid having a team of fewer than 2 FTE developers.  It seems like you are stepping away into an architectural role.\n\nIt can be problematic to be too authoritarian over the long term.  You said you will do all PR reviews.  You should, for sure.  Just don't have a \"my way or the highway\" attitude.  Teams work best when it's flat; all members have equal say into the code's direction.  Of course you are the tie-breaker when debate wheel-spins.  If you can't let go, you aren't going to be a good leader and people will resent it.\n\nDon't **ever** hire a junior unless you have a spec-complete automated test suite and thorough linting, enforced in CI.   You should have those anyway.  Otherwise tech debt will be very hard to manage.\n\n---\n\nMy suggestion:\n\n* Hire 1 senior developer, while you are still be able to code most of the time.  When you code less than 20 hours a week, then hire a 2nd senior.\n* You ack as architect, but all developers' opinions are considered equal when it comes to changing coding standards and structure.  Pass all your new ideas to the team for discussion.\n* All code, including yours, must go through PR review approvals before being merged.  Enforce this in CI.\n* You must have automated tests and linters, enforced in CI.\n* You must have a ticketing system (even if's just trello or a google drive spreadsheet), and good use of version control.",

In the past, I’ve been involved in several projects, smaller ones went fine, but the last two large ones (1–3 years long) went very bad. I joined both halfway through, mostly to help push them to production, so I couldn’t really influence the structure or process. Now I’ve just joined a new company that’s kicking off a major refactoring and some new features project (expected to last almost two years), and I really want to avoid the same pitfalls.\n\nI’m Italian, and honestly, i’ve always struggled with Agile. Too many rituals, too much overhead, not enough freedom. I used to think waterfall was better, but mostly because I didn’t really understand Agile deeply. So I spent time reading up on Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, XP, etc., and i’ve come to believe Agile makes more sense, especially with low code tools.\n\nBut here’s where I’m stuck: in my experience, Agile often means endless rework because requirements keep changing or were never properly analyzed at the start. Budgets are fixed here, timelines are tight, and we don’t have the luxury of endless iteration. On low-code platforms, even a small change can break multiple parts (data models, rules, UI, etc.), so frequent late changes are really costly.\n\nSo my question is: am I thinking about this wrong? Is there a way to truly apply Agile in this context, or should we invest much more upfront in detailed functional and technical analysis and get everything validated before development?\n\nWould love to hear from people who have faced similar constraints.\n\nThanks!",

You said before the start of the project. Does it mean you do a requirements creation phase before implementation begin or you mean you wrote the requirements for a particular sprint, during the previous sprint?\n\nI'm assuming you running sprints like in scrum.\n\nThanks",

Agility just means that - in contrast to waterfall - you can react quicker on changing requirements and direction, you include your stakeholders early and you always have shippable software. \n\nYour team can agree on what rituals to use. You could skip most of them if you decide that it's not worth it, because you should just use what you need. Its a framework, not a religion. \n\nIf analysis and requirements is a concern, I would choose an agile setup where a recurring technical refinement is done in the team where you spend more time on specifying tickets in detail together(!) before starting to work on them. A benefit of this is that the team is more aware of technical issues/potential roadblocks and that in return raises confidence in your solution and timeline. ",

I believe the problem I encountered was more related to the fault of project managers, who are often completely dominated by clients and the possibility of making them unhappy. In a calm initial phase (within the first few months of the project, when there are no pressing deadlines), they let everything slide, since they're relaxed and not thinking about the future. Then, in the final phase (with a lot of pressure and stringent deadlines), when the client is irritated by things not working, they accept every one of their dictates, for fear of starting a legal dispute.\n\nSo my question is, how do I, as a developer/tech leader, take charge of the situation and prevent this from happening? I'm wondering how I can best approach the initial, calmer part of the project, so as to build an effective analysis that doesn't trigger too many change requests in the future. In other words, how do I ensure that the work done in the initial phase is effective so as not to have a disastrous final phase.",
