If you're planning to put an order for a monthly build of 10.000 units (or even a one-shot order), the EMS and procurement  needs to know weeks, maybe even months ahead, when the manufacturing documents are ready, and when delivery are to start. \n\nBut none of the methods - not even scrum@scale or SAFe - are able to combine the path growing FROM a small team TO a world-wide enterprise. They break down once the company needs to face the facts: They can't do every project they want, because the money is limited. \n\nIf you plan on launching a major change to coincidence with Halloween, and another project is working on the black Friday project and the third is working on the holiday season clearence, and a fourth one deals with new regulations, those projects must start planning the work way ahead in order to not step on each other's toes the month before launch. \n\nOr, those methods (especially SAFe) provide way too much overhead for a small company to manage.\n\nOne of the things I think agile fail to address, is that on a higher level, product management needs to know at certain project gates if they are going to take the next step in the project or kill it completely. The latter doesn't meen running rm -rf /src, but even if they realize halfway through a €500 M project they are on the wrong path, making any meaningful change on the project goal level still means the project goes back to square one since that inevitably means a non-trivial change of requirements, priorities, team interdpendencies or even dependencies on deliverables that other projects expects this project to deliver.\n\nWith any decently sized project (even if we're only talking about €5 M in size), there's inevitably going to be a lot of teams involved, and neither developers, scrum masters or even individual teams' product owners might be the ones in direct contact with customers. Delivery of a feature that a customer actually see, might involve several teams' workpackages, developed over a period of sprints.\n\nNot to mention the fact, people come and go in the teams and projects. People that would be perfect to allocate for a specific project might not be available because they are currently busy working with another project, so the team's actual knowledge might be limited.\n\nFrom my experience as PO - and software development in general for the last 25+ years - I do believe scrum works, and it works well on a team level.",

The real failure happens when teams pretend they’re optimizing for one set of principles while being governed by another. Alignment beats purity every time. Bottom line: agree on the principles, be honest about the constraints, and be pragmatic about the practices. Labels don’t deliver value, people do.",

In reality, I see a recurring pattern: teams feel forced to agree to dates suggested by managers, or they provide dates based on their own narrow context without seeing the 'big picture' of the company strategy.\n\nThe result? Managers spend half their lives in planning meetings, yet dates are still missed and everyone is pulling all-nighters at the end of the sprint anyway. It feels like the responsibility is in a 'no-man's land.'\n\nI'm curious about your experience. Should we be pushing harder for teams to own the planning? Or is it time to admit that Product Owners/Managers should handle the 'when' while we handle the 'how'? Assuming teams still provide the high-level estimates and the technical input to make informed decisions. \n\nWould love some honest perspectives on this.",

Lots of very informed opinions here. \n\nA lot of devs I have worked with in the past somehow drew the conclusion that estimated dates aren’t part of Agile. I’m not sure where this fallacy comes from. \n\nI like to use this analogy. Let’s say you are knocking down your house to build a new one. You need to rent somewhere, you need to maybe store furniture and belongings somewhere. There may be extra costs with regards to traveling to work and kids to school. It’s not unreasonable to ask your builder for a ball park estimate. And as you get closer to that estimate the builder should be able to confidently give a better timeframe. \n\nThe expectation that businesses who are paying for this development don’t have the right to ask for estimates seems unreal to me. People wouldn’t expect it from a builder but then turn around and ask the business to not ask. They may also have other financial knock on decisions to make just like you having pay an extra month of rent because the build isn’t finished. \n\nNow of course, how these are communicated, treated and actioned by the business is the core problem. \n\nThey should really treat it like a really long airline flight. A plane leaves London for Sydney. Journey should take 22 hours. So an estimated arrival time is given. As the plane hits various points in the journey all kinds of unforeseen events can occur that may affect the timeline. But once the plane hits Asia, then the west coast of Australia, the pilots can more confidently convey an arrival time. If we can train business people to think in these terms with Agile development it becomes a better way to work for everyone.",

Kanban is just chaos displayed as post-it's on a whiteboard) is good for mature, autonomous teams all working with one single project and an active PO.\n\nWe all know, that's the academic simplification of a reality that doesnt look like that at all, especially if the features requested are more complex than just adjusting the color of a button or piping data as-is from the database to the UI.\n\nAs PO, I can ask for the /time/ a certain story will take, but I also need to give the team the prerequisites for success; as clear requirements /as reasonable/, sufficient priority in the backlog, as few dependencies on other teams as possible, and a reasonable chance of estimating the work (IMHO, it's better to ask for estimates of a small set of tasks ever other morning, instead of dumping a full backlog on sprint start day). Given that, it's possible to make an assessment on the likelyhood of a delivery by date X, assuming the tasks have the right priorities in the backlog. \n\nAnd by the way. Dump the sprints. Instead, work in iterations, with a steady cadence. Do the math: unless all stories at the bottom of the sprint backlog are 1 calendardays worth of work including review and test, they will either spill onto the next sprint, or there will be devs idling waiting for new stories during the last day(s) of the sprint.\n\nBut we can't get rid of the fact that other parts of the organization are actually dependent on knowing /when/ the feature is going to be delivered, bug-free and closed; marketing needs to plan PR events, operations/manufacturing needs to plan roll-out, support and sales needs training etc. \n\nAnd upper management needs to know when the resources can be made available for new projects, which will affect the decisions of which projects to start and which to ditch.\n\nAt the same time, doing V model style requirements, architecture, design, implementation etc as a glorified waterfall process, doesn't work either unless the drawbacks are accepted: nothing can be delivered until all documents have been signed off; bugs won't be found until way into the execution; bugs in design, architecture or requirements won't surface until near the end of the project. \n\nI've been pondering about a model that bridge the agile low-overhead of small teams to the predictably needed by large organizations. I think it's possible. But it's not scrum, SAFe or scrum@scale.",

None.\n\nHere's why: yes, delivery time is affected by scope and quality expectations - the classic trade-offs. But what actually dominates? **The system your team works in** \\- pushing more work in progress, the dependencies, the interruptions, the unclear requirements, the bottlenecks, the context switching.\n\nAnd who shapes that system? Largely the same people setting the dates.\n\nSo when dates slip, the team gets blamed for \"bad estimates\" - but they were never in control of the variables that actually determine delivery time. It's a setup for failure.\n\n  \n**So what's the alternative? Measure your predictability and Improve on it**\n\nReal example: A team's 3-point stories take anywhere from **0.3 days to 3.6 days**. Same estimate, 10x difference in delivery time.\n\nWhen you break it down by work type, **bugs account for 33% of the total variation** \\- twice as unpredictable as stories.\n\nNow you have something actionable: audit how bugs are defined, standardize the workflow, or estimate them separately.\n\nFix the system, and estimates become reliable. Here's what we use to measure and improve predictability: [https://smartguess.is/solutions/predictive-estimation/](https://smartguess.is/solutions/predictive-estimation/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=predictive_estimation&utm_content=pulling-all-nighters)",

And I rarely see that combination anywhere. Instead I see product owners who lack vision and courage, scrum masters who succumb to the 'Scrum in Name Only, PM with Scrum labels' mentality, and code jockeys who only want someone who tell them what to do so that they can do it and go home.\n\nAnd forget about upper management. They are all about fixed scope and deadlines. \"Get it done by X date or else.\" \"But what about Agile?\" \"Sure be agile. But this BRD all has to be done six months from now,  or else.\"\n\nYou only see Agile implemented correctly in a tiny number of places.

I can't make many definitive general observations, but I see a lot of similar patterns.\n\nWhat I see in the situation you describe is a leader whose institutional or regional culture values [individualism over long-term orientation](https://geerthofstede.com/culture-geert-hofstede-gert-jan-hofstede/6d-model-of-national-culture/), who is compromising their role either through ignorance, hubris, or fear of losing their job. Or, more likely, a mix of all three! I've seen that behaviour in Project Managers in a Software House using Waterfall; it's orthogonal to agility: it's simply despair.\n\nThe [Hersey-Blanchard Model](https://experianta.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Situational-Leadership-Theory.png) can help leaders \\*or their people\\* increase autonomy by building trust. The best Scrum Masters and coaches build trust (the person you're describing is destroying trust by over-controlling your team). A way through the conflict is to negotiate greater autonomy through increasing trust - sometimes our leaders don't lead; that's when new leaders reveal themselves.",

My slack, meeting notes, customer calls, eng asking clarifying questions I should've answered upfront.\n\nIs everyone still doing this manually or have people found AI tools that actually help here? Not talking about \"summarize this doc.\" I mean something that can pull from multiple sources, get me most of the way to a good ticket, and push it to Jira without me copy-pasting fields one by one.\n\nTried using ChatGPT but all the copy / paste makes it pretty impractical. At a certain point its fast just to write it myself\n\nEdit: Thanks for the feedback. I actually ended up finding a tool that a friend recommended and it seems pretty useful.

So instead of a bad PO making a dozen bad tickets I have a bad AI PO making a hundred bad tickets. It will keep the devs busy, but it won't deliver on the point of scrum\n\nWhat I'd really like to do and haven't gotten to yet is conduct user interviews with transcription and ask AI to built user stories drawing on the transcripts.

Oh we need X from another team first - Congratulations, you've discovered a dependency that is preventing your team from operating in a truly independent manner. Scrum did what it was intended to do: Find issues. It's up to you to fix it.\n2. The PRD was vague, now PO wants something different - It's gonna happen. But what changed to cause the PO to change their mind? Increased understanding of the problem space? That's a good thing.\n3. This turned out to be way more complex than estimated - That's gonna happen as well, even in cases where you thoroughly investigate the problem first. Good thing we didn't waste a lot of time estimating. Just split the story and move on.\n4. We discovered an edge case that changes everything - Awesome. Understanding increased. Value generated. Perfect. Now the ball is back in the POs court.\n\nLook, we know creating perfect plans is hard and diminishing returns bites pretty hard, pretty quickly. So:\n\n* We plan for small increments\n* We don't waste a lot of time planning\n* We get in there and start working, where the learning really happens\n* We deal with whatever pops up.\n\nThat's new product development in an uncertain problem space.\n\nNow, if you don't NEED that, that's cool.

Sprints are short _so that adjustments can be made to the forecast and risks are eventuated_.\n\nIf a failure leads to a learning, leads to an improvement, then you have a _learning organisation_ which is a rare and valuable gem. \n\nTo answer your question directly: \n\n1) failures due to external dependencies. This is because the organisation has not embraced cross functional teams, so people see an easy job, then have to put in a request with another department, who doesn't prioritize them. I call this the \"fishing minigame\" because the work is all stop until something outside your influence decides to award you a randomised outcome. \n\n2) failures due to internal dependencies. This is because we trust the (PI) plans of other teams in the trains and don't ask at the sprint review how or dependencies are coming along\n\n3) too much in the plan. Teams count the number of person hours available and fill up the team's capacity, missing the concept of focus factor or velocity. Then, they have failed to account for empirically observed interruptions\n\n4) competency collapse in some teams. Senior managers are restricting budgets for training, teams are reorganized and experts leave. You end up with C++ engineers building Jenkins pipelines, or support teams having no inkling how support teams measure themselves and survive. \n\n5) social contract collapse in some teams. Particularly post-COVID we see new starters who aren't interested in the mission, who don't understand they are paid to deliver, who use their daily standup slot to talk about their dog walking or dental appointments.",

This team includes 1 PM, 1 Team Lead, 8 devs, and 2 automated QA.\n\nMy central issue is that the team is I’ll not meaningfully self govern and I have to constantly push to keep things moving.  Common issues include:\n\n1. Team does not report when stuck or things are complicated.  They stop work.  I have to check in with everyone twice a day proactively to ensure they are not blocked.\n\n2. No testing of any kind.  Automated testing does not show me frameworks or plans, and only clicks on buttons at my specific request.  I can’t even give them a list of features to manually test…I must remind them (often multiple times) to get them to test prior to deployment.  This also means that every fix just introduces more bugs, which only I catch when doing E2E testing EVERY night.\n\n3. Team will not split up items or ask questions.  I have to assign every story, and perfect waterfall requirements (which anticipate every question) must be provided or devs will not start work.\n\n4. No help ideating.  Nobody has ever contributed an idea, any input on prioritizing, or any thoughts about relative lift for items.  I just get silence every time I ask.\n\nHonestly, this only scratches the surface.  Nothing is ever moving, and I have to put in Herculean effort to complete every task.  Doing all of the above only accounts for about 25% of my current workload, as I own every facet of the product (customer success, sales, marketing, roadmapping, research, etc).\n\nI am under heavy fire from the executive team as they are unhappy with pace of progress.  They say I need to 5x development speed within 2 months or I will be fired.  \n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation?  Any advice about what I can do here?",

I spare you the talk about \"leading the dev team should not be your job\" (I bet you're aware of that, as much as I am aware that sometimes it happens to be as in your case).\n\nI am somewhat in a similar situation (also PM with a team with no real engineering lead). But still, we have \"Lead Engineers\", 7 devs, 1 UX, 1 PO (me) (and one virtually non-functioning scrum master who I guess mentally quit already, at least in this position - though, strangely he keeps clinging to it, but that is another story).\n\nWhat I want to say is this: I also don't have perfect circumstances by the books and still we somehow managed to instill some ownership into the team - not as much as I would have wanted sometimes, but still. \n\nA part of it comes down to the individuals, but a lot comes by leadership - also the product owner: If you \\_show\\_ the people, that you'll be their garbage can and jump in on everything, that should not be your job, they'll get used to it and never step up.\n\nUltimately, development effort demands \\_ownership\\_ of people over issues and artefacts and processes and stuff. For most things, there needs to be someone who \\_cares\\_, who takes it on them to move some thing further: and that someone cannot be you in every instance. It's not only not healthy and unsustainable, it also will not bring the change you - and your bosses - desire: 5x'ing output cannot come from you whipping people into obedience.\n\nThat is maybe not the answer you're looking for - but what I would do is this: map out the process of development and mark down, where there should be someone (not putting names, no blame game) that should be responsible / that should care. Identify holes in your process and show it to your leadership and tell them: If these holes will not be filled with \\_caring and meaningfulness\\_ then any output pipeline will burst rather sooner than later.",

From my perspective, that gives you the authority to start making changes.\n* Personally, here's what I would do:\n   * Sit the team lead down and ask them what the hell they are doing. Have a heart to heart. Either get them on board or make them the first one out the door.\n   * Go through the current team and honestly think about who's a net positive. Keep them. Jettison the rest. You'll probably find the dead wood was holding back the ones who can actually contribute.\n   * Have a \"reset\" for the project. Make your expectations for the team clear. You expect them to think and contribute. Take the team out. Make it clear that the past is forgotten but the expectation is that shit will be different going forward.\n   * If your team lead hasn't made it this far, find new allies that can shoulder most of the responsibility in the dev team so you can refocus on the other work you've been neglecting.\n   * Get one of these to start thinking about developer practices and quality.\n   * Slowly re-add team members.\n\nNow, two months is not long, so you need to move VERY quickly. I'm a firm believer in removing dead wood as they kill motivation around them like nothing else. Even if you can't fire them, just tell them to work on crossword puzzles or something and to not bother your team. Give HR a heads up as there's bound to be whining. I guess I should also mention I'm very much a \"ask for forgiveness, not permission\" kind of person.\n\nIf you don't think this is even remotely possible, then use the two months to polish your resume and get it out there.",

Wtf is the team lead doing? Sounds like they're not pulling their weight at all. \n\n\nIf leadership is expecting you to be responsible for the whole thing they need to give you the ability to replace team members and restructure things that are affecting delivery. \n\n\nOtherwise you need to find another job and stop trying to salvage things because this is not going to end well for you.  \n\n\nMy advice - offer a solution to leadership. They love this shit as it looks like it solves their lack of leadership. This will give you time to find a new job at the very least. \n\n\nBlame the 'delivery structure' say it needs rework and this is the new delivery structure we need to follow. \n\n\nPowerPoint an ownership and delivery structure for the team. Make it clear who owns what and say you need leadership support. Include a workflow for how things get delivered.\n\n\n- Product defines what and roadmap. Suggest a low level BA to support daily clarification and user stories. This team takes business needs, assesses cost benefit and prioritizes features. The BA supports daily discussion and clarify with dev and QA.\n- PM defines timeline and cost and *owns* delivery timing. They should be monitoring progress closely and pushing teams. \n- Dev defines how and inputs on timing. They own dev work. They provide input on roadmap from a technical perspective. \n- Ask for QA because it improves quality and catches issues early not in prod, reducing delivery cost, timing and rework. \n\n\nSuggest a 3 way shared leadership group of product, pm, and Dev lead / architect. This separates accountability and puts it in the court of the others too.\n\n\nThe PM should report progress regularly to leadership via a weekly update. This gives leadership some sense of control.  It also puts some onus on the PM. \n\n\nIf the PM/dev lead are not able to take on some leadership suggest they replace them on the team with someone who can. For the sake of delivery process. \n\n\nAt the very least this will buy you time and this exercise will give you some nice strategic shit to put on your resume. Look at this as a learning opportunity to grow your career.  ",

He has individual 1:1s with each of us but no regular group sync, and largely expects us to self-organise.\n\nOn day one, he shared a document outlining responsibilities:\n\t•\tSenior PM: strategy and stakeholder relationships\n\t•\tMe: Scrum process and delivery\n\t•\tJunior PM: coordination and release support\n\nI started by running discovery workshops to understand current team practices and then gradually introduced Scrum cadence, with the aim of reducing change fatigue and bringing teams along through retrospectives and workshops.\n\nThe problem is that the other two PMs keep interfering with the areas I am meant to own:\n\n\t•\tThey attend Scrum ceremonies and publicly challenge or derail meetings with questions and suggestions\n\t•\tIn 1:1 conversations, they talk about plans to coach teams on estimation and process\n\t•\tThe senior PM now wants to do a “big bang” presentation telling all teams to follow a strict Scrum process immediately as she is not able to collect meaningful data from current state of Jira. \n\nShe also wants to change how I set up Scrum ceremonies and plans to announce during her presentation instead of discussing with me (this is what she told me). She is not my boss though. We both report to the same director and he told me clearly that each of us were individual contributors with not much overlap in our responsibilities.\n\nTeams are already tired of constant change, and having three PMs pushing different ideas is clearly making things worse. Engagement is dropping.\n\nI’ve directly raised this with both PMs and even revisited the original responsibility document together. They acknowledged it in the moment but continued behaving the same way the following week.\n\nI actually asked my manager about potential overlap during my first week in this company and he said he didn’t see much overlap between us. However, in practice, it feels like a competition over ownership of delivery and process.\n\nI’m UK-based, while my manager, the other PMs, and most teams are offshore. I’m worried about escalating too hard and being seen as “difficult” or as rocking the boat, but the current setup isn’t working and is actively harming delivery.\n\nHow would you handle this?",

The responsibility doc exists, but it isn’t being *used* to resolve conflict, so people default to influence and visibility instead. That’s why direct conversations haven’t stuck.\n\nA few practical moves that tend to work without blowing things up:\n\nFirst, stop debating process in public forums. When ceremonies get derailed, acknowledge the input and park it. Then follow up offline. Over time this makes it clear that ceremonies aren’t a free for all and reduces performative interference.\n\nSecond, shift the escalation away from personalities and toward impact. Frame it to your manager as “teams are getting conflicting signals and delivery is slowing” rather than “PM X is stepping on my toes.” Managers act faster on risk to outcomes than on interpersonal tension.\n\nThird, ask for one thing from your manager, not a big reorg. For example, a short recurring PM sync with explicit decision rights, or a clear rule that delivery and Scrum changes funnel through one owner. You’re not asking for power, you’re asking for clarity.\n\nFourth, document decisions in writing and circulate them. Not heavy docs, just clear summaries. When someone later contradicts it, you can point to alignment already reached instead of re arguing.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that in environments like this, delivery only stabilizes when someone actively protects it. If your manager won’t do that, you have to make the risk visible without making it personal. Otherwise the teams will keep absorbing the chaos for you, and that’s usually what leadership notices too late.",

When something feels off, missed commitments, friction between roles, unclear ownership, passive standups, the first instinct is almost always to tweak the process. Add a new ceremony. Change the retro format. Adjust story points. Rewrite the working agreement. Maybe introduce a new rule and hope it sticks.\n\nSometimes that helps. But a lot of times, it doesn’t.\n\nLooking back, some of the messiest situations I’ve seen weren’t process problems at all. They were things like unspoken frustration between team members, unclear expectations from a PO or a quiet lack of trust that no amount of backlog grooming was ever going to fix. We kept polishing the framework while avoiding the one uncomfortable conversation that actually mattered.\n\nWhat’s tricky is that process feels safe. It’s neutral. Nobody gets defensive when you suggest a new board or a different standup structure. Conversations are harder. They require naming things, slowing down and accepting that not everything can be solved with a Jira setting or a Scrum Guide quote.\n\nWhat’s a situation where you went all-in on adjusting the agile process and only later realized the real fix was just an honest conversation the team had been avoiding?",

      "text": "I work at a service provider as an Agile Coach, and I’ve been asking myself this question more and more lately, especially in the current economic climate.\n\nDue to budget cuts, some customers end their collaboration with service providers and bring products back in-house. For Scrum teams, this often means working on the same product for years, building deep domain and user knowledge, and taking responsibility for quality and longterm technical decisions, while knowing that the product can be taken away at any time.\n\nFrom an Agile and Scrum perspective, this creates a fundamental tension. Core principles such as product ownership, long-term value orientation, user-centered thinking, and real empowerment are hard to live when ownership ultimately always remains with the customer and is contractually limited. Empowerment tends to end where budget and contract boundaries begin.\n\nIn practice, this often leads teams, quite rationally, into a feature factory mode. The focus shifts from outcomes to outputs. Features are delivered because they are ordered, not because the team truly owns the product impact. Reviews become acceptances, user-centered thinking turns into a technique rather than a mindset, and Scrum is reduced to a well-paced delivery framework.\n\nEspecially in economically unstable times, emotional detachment feels like a form of self-protection for teams. Instead of real identification with the product, what remains is a professional delivery mode. From my point of view, this stands in clear tension with Agile values and the idea of long-lived, empowered product teams.\n\nI’m trying to understand whether this is mainly a problem of how Scrum is applied at our company, or whether this represents a structural limitation of Agile ways of working within the classic service-provider model.\n\nI’d really like to hear how others see this from an Agile or Scrum perspective.",

After all, it's all a big experiment, and experiments often fail. You can often hear, as a recommendation for defining the sprint goal, the question, 'if this were our last sprint, what would actually matter?'\n\n>  Core principles such as product ownership, long-term value orientation, user-centered thinking, and real empowerment are hard to live when ownership ultimately always remains with the customer and is contractually limited.\n\nIs the customer not interested in delivering value to the user (if he is not the user of the product himself)? Is he not interested in getting value from the product?\n\n> In practice, this often leads teams, quite rationally, into a feature factory mode. The focus shifts from outcomes to outputs. [etc]\n\nWhy is any of this natural? I can understand from your description that, ultimately, it is the customer, i.e. the party with money, who has ownership of the product; but why are they not collaborating with the development team? Why are they not interested in the outcome? Why are budget cuts responsible for this?",

While the agile values and principles can be just as valuable, when you are in a fundamentally contractual relationship with your user/customer, it becomes harder (not impossible) to apply a value like cooperation above contract negotiation.

They want to go away from having their own teams, which over the last year have become increasingly focused, happy and productive (and the internal customers along with them!). They want to go to a managed service model where 'we contractually agree to get all the benefits we have now'.\n\nI'm pessimistic about that working out. (and won't go into the fallacies in logic arguing in favour of this switch).\n\nAgain, any agile value and principle can be applied and useful (I firmly believe this holds true in any knowledge work situation), but the context makes this harder or easier, and a managed service (contractual) relationship makes it harder.",

We're not reporting them to anyone.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, that's about the business outcomes we are trying to create.  \n  \nAgain, that varies with organizational and product strategy, but these are closer to \"metrics\";  they tend to boil down to the business benefits created in some way: \n\n\\- saves time (ie opportunity cost decrease)  \n\\- saves money (ie actual cost decrease)  \n\\- makes money (ie revenue increase)   \n\\- reduces risk (of slips, lapses, mistakes, rework as well as cyber etc)  \n\\- durability (extension of product lifecycle)  \n\\- convenience (UX)  \n\\- prestige (brand, status or ego)",

On a team level, flow metrics are much more valuable since they are focused on the throughput of value rather than activity.\n\nThere's is one central question you should ask yourself regarding metrics: with what intent are you measuring?\n\nMost organizations you will find they measure to exert control. They mean to ensure teams are producing enough to keep the money printer going. Aside from the obvious lack of trust this lays bare (and trust is the foundation for any agile enterprise to succeed) it also evokes Goodheart's Law. For those not familiar with it:\n\n>*\"****When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure****\"*\n\nMeasuring to control, reward or punish basically means that any metric will be gamed for the advantage of the people at the receiving end. This is where you get your watermellon reports from (green on the outside, red on this inside)\n\nHowever, if you leverage metrics for learning instead, there is no incentive to bullshit the results. In fact, it incentives to create more accurate data in order to perform better, increase flow, and create better, more satisfying outcomes. This of course requires that the organization *trusts* teams (and the people that compose them) to do the right things.",

The goal is to have this at zero. Teams should finish the sprint with nothing in progress. This doesn't include items in Todo (if the work didn't start, then it's not in progress). The wanted behavior is that there is no spillover, since it restricts the amount of high prio work we can pick next sprint. This is trivial to achieve regularly when teams know how to slice items mid sprint.\n\n\n\n\nBacklog Ranking of items picked for next sprint. The goal is to pick the top items. If the picked items are #3 and #4, we should ask why #1 & #2 were passed over. The wanted behavior is that teams respect the po's priority as much as possible. No point in a PO if the teams pick whatever they want and ignore priority. ",

          "text": "Appreciate the thoughts here, but... when it comes to metrics, everyone does them backwards!!!\n\nPeople always first identify the metric they want to track and then they move forward and eye it continuously to make sure the metric meets their interpretation. Wrong!!!\n\nFirst, you have to state - WHAT IS THE PROBLEM YOU\"RE TRYING TO SOLVE?\n\nThen, you can select the metrics that help baseline the problem and also metrics that would help track improvement. \n\nBut, the biggest failure is assuming that one or a few metrics are needed to create a picture. No. Its almost like the laws of forces in physics - \"every action has an equal and opposite reaction\". Tweaking one metric and optimizing one thing - usually triggers de-optimization of another. \n\nFor example, if you want to improve quality, get ready for slower pace of work, get ready for less new things getting done, get ready to direct more attention to bugs and support cases, which again lead to slowing down the pace of developing new things. \n\nThe next thing - how you track things is important. Do you track of averages, or do you look at specific work item and how each went? Because averages will get you in trouble. Don't focus on averages, focus on those where things are wrong. Imagine target shooting, if you keep hitting the grouping, that's not bad. To improve, focus on addressing the shots outside the grouping.\n\nSo the metrics here identified as the \"RIGHT\" metrics. Not really, they are just \"another set\" of metrics.\n\nFlow time --> how long work actually takes   >>> first, lets define it right, its now how long it takes, its how long it takes to get to the customer in production. Which is basically cycle-time + deployment time, or implementation time. Why is this important? Do you really need to track every work item delivery to the customer? Why? Customer doesn't care about all items equally. Maybe if you're running a tech consultancy, or custom dev shop, but otherwise, not really important IMHO.\n\nThroughput --> how many items are finished per unit of time >>> Unless you're following #noestimates, this serves no value. Especially if you pick up varying amounts of different type of work, because you can't decompose everything into equally measurable elements of scope. And throughput can be abused no worse than Velocity. \"Why did you guys complete only 15 items instead of throughput of 20 you got every 2 weeks for the past 3 months?\" Shitty question to ask, and even worse to answer. But... it WILL be asked.\n\nWIP --> how much work is started but not finished >>> Do you mean average WIP? Or are you trying to keep track of the limit for one team? Are you trying to track activity across multiple projects and teams to detect lack of organizational focus towards a common goal? WIP by itself is just a number. Its an indicator that serves more the most value while working, not historically from past sprints. Exceed the WIP and hit the limit? Great! Take action. Don't hit the limit for a while and the work is slow? Then limit is too large!\n\nWork item age --> how long current work has been stuck >>> Means nothing if nobody is tracking it and taking action. Not all work is same size. So what's your \"Work Item Age\" red line that has everyone asking questions? And why does the conversation about things needing help are not brought up in the daily? As a matter of fact, running a good daily makes Work Item Age metric obsolete. Its only value is if someone is stepping away from the team for a while and then coming back would like to quickly catch up to understand what's happening. \n\nSo all in all, metrics are important, but not all metrics are equal or better than another in various environments.",

          "text": ">**Payment Triggers:** If you are delivering incrementally (e.g., every 2 weeks), do you actually invoice every 2 weeks?\n\nIn my experience, organizations, especially larger enterprises, have policies around how they pay. In one organization, outside of paying for specific jobs (think facilities services, or from software/IT, a penetration test with a defined scope), it was a pain to have a contract that was less than a year. When we wanted to buy a SaaS product, if the vendor didn't have the desired terms, we needed to use a reseller. Paying per iteration is probably the most by-the-book \"Agile\", it's also not necessarily the most realistic.\n\nDepending on the context, you also may want to separate iteration from incremental delivery. Is your customer really accepting a delivery every 2 weeks? You may be getting feedback every 2 weeks, but you may only be delivering to production every month or two or even three. Not all customers want frequent production changes, outside of resolving critical defects and security patches.\n\nShort story: you'll probably need to separate payment cycles from your development process and account for this in the agreements and contracts, especially what happens (penalties and refunds) if they want to end the arrangement early for any reason.  \n\n\n>**The \"Half-Done\" Problem:** In civil, if a contractor leaves, usually a consulting firm hired by the contractee measure what they built and approve the payment. In software, if a vendor delivers \"90% of a feature\" and leaves, that 90% is often useless to the next vendor (who might want to rewrite it). How do you protect against paying for \"useless 90% code\"?\n\nMost of my experience is in fields where the customer doesn't get the software. They are either buying a physical product (sometimes configured to meet a particular customer's needs) that contains software or they are buying software as a service. In these cases, this isn't applicable.\n\nThe \"Agile\" answer goes back to your first question. If you're paying often, you're seeing at least demonstrations of working software very quickly and understanding the cost. You can compare value to cost and end the arrangement if things seem to be going out of control. But, seeing my answer to that part, plenty of organizations choose not to work that way, meaning they don't see the financial benefits of very short iterations and small increments.\n\nIf you are working in a situation where you deliver code to a customer, it would be on them to work with future vendors to understand the implications of using that code versus throwing it away and starting again. If you're outsourcing software development, you probably don't have the technical resources to evaluate the technical decisions made, so I'm not sure what options are available to protect yourself.  \n\n\n>**Bidding:** Do you bid purely on hourly rates? Or do clients demand a \"Fixed Price\" for a scope that hasn't been designed yet? How it mainly works in contracts?\n\nI've usually seen time-based rates for SaaS products that account for the teams supporting the product, infrastructure costs, growth, and profit margins. For custom or configured software, it was usually a cost-plus contract, either a fixed fee or goal-based incentives, with a set timeline for renewing the contract.",

There was a formal signoff on the invoice amount, but that did not relate to looking at our work directly.

Don't overthink it or try to fake deep Agile expertise you don't have yet. Be honest about being newer to the formal PO title but confident about your transferable skills in prioritization, stakeholder management, and translating business needs into actionable work. They're testing if you're worth passing to the hiring manager, not if you can recite the Scrum Guide.\n\nThe biggest red flags they're listening for are bad-mouthing previous employers, unclear career motivations, unrealistic salary expectations that waste everyone's time, or someone who clearly has no idea what a Product Owner actually does. Your background is actually solid for this transition - data-driven decision making and stakeholder translation are core PO competencies - so just connect those dots clearly and show genuine interest in the product ownership path. If you want to practice articulating your experience in terms that resonate with PO interview questions, I built [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat) to help with exactly that - it gives real-time guidance on how to frame your answers when you're navigating these transitions.",

With this education you are able to talk to professionals on a same level, knowing what each terms means exactly and explicitly in order to avoid implicit misconceptions. A few sentences are not enough here to explain the theory and value of a PMP, its knowledge areas, project phases and artifacts. \n\nPractice and experience is equally important, combined with a PMP you will be dream PM for every employer.\n\nSimple example: Scrum Masters without any profound knowledge and certifications, proclaiming themselves as best in practice not needing any classes, are usually the ones who mess everything up. There are too many people in the market with half-baked superficial knowledge talking down the value of certification and education, not willing to invest in these due to lack of will, dedication, putting real effort into something etc. - quick and dirty without sustainability. \n\nI am sure I may get a lot of downvoted for that, but if you want to outstand from the grey mass of pseudo-PMs without any proper education, get a reliable certification and improve yourself on actual professional knowledge.",

We know that some people embellish resumes and others are just \"good interviewers.\" Beyond, but oftentimes including certs, one needs not only proof of work experience, but the requisite soft skills to show one's true potential as a PM. Especially if one is to be leveraged towards critical, complex, and strategic projects in the business.\n\nLet's be honest, the PMP is not easy to get. For the vast majority of people, it takes serious study and rigor. I have never met any PM who achieved the PMP by taking the test cold, without any (or just a little) study. Conversely, I achieved my Scrum Master and Product Owner certs with just a week's worth of study for each (to be fair, those frameworks are light by design which does not make them inadequate). In my program, PMs with a PMP or PRINCE2 - for my European PMs - generally outperform those without them. What we have observed across our PMs is that the cert provides a common framework for governance and execution that is hard to replicate.\n\nBut, do we hire PMs without certification? Absolutely. We still hire uncertified PMs if their communication and skill-specific thought logic show obvious value. If they are the right fit, we will hire a PM and actually pay to get them certified later.\n\nThe PMP isn’t a magic pill, but it’s far from decorative. It’s a tool that, when combined with the right personal/professional attributes, makes a huge difference. Is it the end all, be all? No. It isn't.",

The entire reason Agile exists is it support projects without a rigidly-defined scope (which is actually most software projects when you get down to any level of detail). You can't tell me exactly what you need done, so I can't tell you when it will be done.\n\nNow, if you can tell me exactly what needs to be done, don't take an Agile approach. It is inefficient and the benefits aren't needed. However, I'm old enough to remember before Agile and the year after year of projects where \"no, really, we know exactly what we have to do this time\".

      "text": "I'm in a somewhat unique situation at a firm where the information security team operates in a way that I believe is against best practices. Rather than providing stakeholder representation for every phase of a project, they instead hold weekly 1 hour meetings where we attempt to cover an agenda of topics for them to review. These are prepared topics that have arisen during meetings over the previous week (or sometimes longer) during project initiation or really any phase of a project may be in-progress. Essentially the dev team is responsible for trying to predict when something on a project requires security review, gets it on the agenda, and waits until that weekly meeting to bring it to the group and find out if they give it a thumbs-up, thumbs-down, or require more time to review.  \nThis creates some obvious problems when something high-priority is blocked because of the need to wait for that weekly meeting. It's also inefficient when the security team has minimal or no context to the project at hand, because they have not been participating in any of it. Trying to get them up to speed on the project so that they can understand why we are asking for permission to \"do the thing\" (access some internal database, connect to a 3rd party API, etc...) can make everything even more chaotic.  \nAll formal guidance states that the information security team should be involved in *every phase* of a project including refinement, participating in user stories (creation, acceptance criteria, sign-offs), building, testing, releases, etc... so that they are not an afterthought. This has been my experience in all previous work, except for my current engagement.  \nIt's odd to me that the dev team would own responsibility for knowing what that team should care about, and be on the hook for bringing it to their attention, but then also possibly getting an entire solution slapped down at release time when the security team may hop in and find something they don't like.  \nIs this completely non-standard? Should an effort be made to change the style of the information security team and have them be an active stakeholder in all phases of a project? Is it absurd for the dev team to spend time preparing topics for the security team to review? Is it reasonable for the dev team to stay on top of the ever-evolving standards of what that team may or may not care about?",

Security team is an example of \"shared service\" team, like DevOps and InfoDev. Expecting that they will allocate a person to 1-2 teams, and that person would participate in Scrum ceremonies is not realistic.\n\nI'm not a big SAFe proponent, but it does offer some advice for these situations. It boils down to having periodic syncs to align on priorities and needs. Whether it's every sprint or every month depends on situation.\n\nWhat is important, is that the Scrum team considers dependencies on Security  InfoDev, and DevOps when they refine/groom. Indicating this info on tickets gives those service teams heads up and they can schedule their work. Oh, also remember, that most service teams work in Kanban vs Scrum, and its key to make sure that they provide ETA using Scrum calendar timeline. Otherwise there is a risk of constant misalignment.",

Confluence whiteboard lagged a bit, but that could have been the spotty internet at my location at the time.\n\n\nI find miro and mural to be more convenient to write in, as they both have a more intuitive way of automatically resizing text in notes, also miro has uml elements included, both come with auto-sort options. \n\n\nMore relevant: How do you structure your canvas, and how do you plan to run the session? ",

          "text": "What’s worked best for distributed sprint planning is using a canvas that becomes the *shared memory* of the session, not just a whiteboard.\n\nThe key is reducing context switching. Sticky notes, story maps, and capacity all visible at once so people aren’t jumping between tools while trying to reason together. Real time cursors and lightweight structure matter more than fancy features.\n\nI’ve found planning improves when the canvas persists after the meeting. Teams can revisit decisions, async refine stories across time zones, and avoid re explaining context every sprint. The tool matters less than treating the canvas as the source of truth, not just a meeting aid.",

      "text": "**Navigating My GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) Using Agile Principles**  \n***Feedback*** *•* ***Adaptability*** *•* ***Resilience***\n\nGlioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, has a bleak prognosis, with a median survival of 12 to 18 months post-diagnosis.\n\nOne quiet evening, I stumbled and found out that I couldn’t recall my daughter’s birthday. My daughter suggested that I got scanned at a local ER (Emergency Room), June 7, 2024.  The wait was long, around 7 hours, but the decision was quick to take out the growing tumor in my upper left brain.\n\nThe next day, I was in my recovery room and every “circle one” of my family members including my son who had to take a quick flight from Taiwan to Phoenix was there to support me.  Everyone was PRESENT!\n\n**Objective Feedback**\n\n* Clinical data: scans, labs (require lots of waiting time, patience, and resilience)\n* Somatic feedback: fatigue (afternoon nap time)\n* This objective feedback is crucial in monitoring our health progress\n\n**Agile lens:**\n\n* Short inspect-and-adapt cycles\n* **Feedback as information, not judgment**\n\nI learned to treat fatigue like a signal, **not a weakness**.\n\n**Adaptability**\n\nTreatments – got a series of radiations and chemotherapies\n\n* My radiations – nice facilities and nurses\n* The chemotherapies – oral pills\n* MRI scans -every 8 weeks (on going)\n\n **Agile behaviors:**\n\n* Reprioritization over abandonment\n* Direction over prediction\n* Adaptation is not failure; it’s competence\n\n**Resilience: Sustaining the System**\n\n**Agile principle: Sustainable pace**\n\n* Rest is part of the work, YES, REST is a big part of your RECOVERY PROCESS\n* Resilience is systemic, not heroic.  We MUST follow our energy flow\n\n**Personal story:**  \nI pushed too hard early on, trying to “power through.” My recovery improved only after I treated rest as a non-negotiable sprint requirement.\n\nREST, REST and REST!!!\n\n**My Agile Team Model**\n\n**My Team**\n\n* Oncologists, nurses, caregivers\n* Family and friends\n* Me as “Product Owner”\n\n**Key insight:**\n\n* Psychological safety enables honest feedback.  Some of the honest feedback are not pleasant, i.e. my choice of Fried Chicken vs Broiled Chicken\n* Shared goals > hierarchical control. I am the Dad, Samurai style\n\n **What Agile Changed for Me**\n\n**Agile gave me:**\n\n* Language for uncertainty – realistic “time-left” in this world… really!\n* Permission to adapt without shame. It is what it is\n* Focus on progress, not perfection; progress can be seen with normal eyes\n\n **Final thought:**\n\n* Agile doesn’t remove uncertainty.  It gives us a sense of priority and urgencies.  We must take care of our available time and resources\n* Our family and friends are always there for us.  Let’s reverse our position now for without them we won’t be around anymore\n* Abandon, yes, abandon!  our so-called go-lucky friends\n* At 64, I feel HAPPY that I am surrounded by first my “circle one” family members and many happy friends\n\nMy Message to all AGILISTS:\n\n**Agile is not only a tool to double your productivity but it is a key indispensable tool that may just save you from your life crisis ONE DAY!**",
