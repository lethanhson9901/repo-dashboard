They had low effort jobs and got paid a livable wage . Good for them. \n\nBut now are the dark ages.

But all too often, you see SMs not willing to understand the actual work, the tech, the product, the outcomes.  it isn't just that you can facilitate and coach.  \n\nI would tweek the things that you say have changed to:\n\n1. they want scrum masters to ALSO be accountable with the team for outcomes - the SM, team, coach, everyone is in it together and if the outcomes are not achieved, ALL of them have failed.  SM and Coaches that focus on form and think that being successful at Agile is the goal... are flat out wrong.\n\n2. product model is more prominent while Agile has become a bad word and a tech thing - the funny thing is that product doesn't mean no Agile... Agile has this thing called a PRODUCT owner.  the notion of a product model becoming the new paradigm is more about the elimination of \"projects\", the continuous planning,, continuous delivery, etc.  \n\n",

Before, everyone was trying to do huge waterfall projects that often burned out dev teams and delivered the wrong project.  It worked.  But when finances tighten, humanity shrinks and I’m afraid we are heading right back to the old days again.  \n\nPlus, we’re in a new phase now in the industry.  Most of the truly groundbreaking systems are kinda like standardized systems now, so requirements are easier to come by.  Agile is really good at discovery and innovation and bringing together diverse stakeholders.  So now, the next gen of software is kinda already specd, and just needs to get ported over to AI. Smart, dedicated developers will be able to do the work better without all the management overhead that Agile Inc became.  Sadly though, those overperformers will lead us right back to sloppy slaughterhouse conditions that many fought so hard to get away from.",

      "text": "I’ve been working at this company for 10 years, currently as a manager overseeing several IT teams. The company has its own internal IT department building internal products. When I started, we were moving from classic waterfall to Scrum. Like in any big corporation (2,000+ people in IT alone), it was slow and painful.\n\nDemos were basically walking through the backlog and accounting for every single task. Sprints had no real goal. Former analysts became Product Owners, and people with the least actual work were sent to Scrum Master trainings. Dailies were used by team leads to check if everyone was “doing something.” The organization cared about how much we delivered and how late it was - not *what* we delivered or what value it brought. A textbook “agile transformation.”\n\nBut after a few years, real change started to show. POs really dug into their domains and had deep knowledge of customers and competitors. IT invested in DevOps to speed up releases. Architecture evolved from one big monolith deployed 5 times a year into hundreds of independent microservices deployed on demand. Backlogs started to reflect actual customer needs instead of just task lists. Employee engagement scores were well above industry average in every survey. Over all of this watched a transformation department made up of Scrum Masters and change leaders.\n\nThen the board changed.\n\nThe new board introduced a new one-year strategy. This strategy had little to do with the product visions owned by individual POs and was pushed into IT through side channels. Chaos followed. Suddenly the board started blaming department directors for not delivering *their* goals. Directors started holding POs accountable for their existing roadmaps while trying to kill future increments to make room for “the strategy.” At the same time, IT directors bypassed POs entirely and pushed architectural changes under the label of “technical debt.”\n\nTeams ended up with three priorities: one from the PO, one from “the business,” and one from IT. Every delay caused fights between these three sides, finger-pointing, and accountability theater. A year passed. The board’s strategy was not delivered.\n\nSo the board decided to fire the entire transformation department (including all Scrum Masters) and introduced “improvement actions” to make sure this would never happen again.\n\nThose improvements included:\n\n* assigning an additional Project Manager to every PO to “help deliver projects on time”\n* abandoning story points in favor of estimating every task in days\n* limiting time for technical debt and bugs (!) to 10% and strictly enforcing reporting\n* hiring additional analysts to create Feature Requirement Documents for every product to “help IT estimate better and improve predictability”\n\nAll of this, of course, branded as *improving our agile way of working*.\n\nThat was 6 months ago.\n\nMore than half of the teams I know haven’t released a single change to production since then. Some teams still haven’t received FRDs for any change at all - analysts have been working on documentation for 6 months, and IT doesn’t even know what’s in it yet. I personally reviewed one of those documents (they had dependencies on my system) and saw that an FRD for a simple change was already 100 pages long.\n\nAt one point they asked me to confirm a single variable. I told them I’d look at it in a month because I was working on something else. They replied that in a month they’d already be assigned to another project and wouldn’t be able to update the document anymore.\n\nI’ve also heard Project Managers explicitly telling teams *not* to log time spent on technical debt, because we’d burn through our yearly 10% too fast and wouldn’t have any left for “more important bugs” later.\n\n10 years of transformation.  \nBuried in 6 months.\n\nI’m watching all of this from the sidelines. My department hasn’t gone through the new “transformation” yet and we’re still working the old way - just the team and the PO. We’re the last department in line for the great enlightenment. I’m going to try to use this time to prove to everyone above that the “old” system can still be efficient. Wish me luck - the last island of agility in this waterfall of despair.\n\nIn my opinion, the board threw the baby out with the bathwater. After the first year they clearly lost trust in POs and dismantled the entire system instead of trying other approaches. Not all POs were good at their job, and that’s probably the most important lesson I’m taking away from this whole story: being a PO is brutally hard and comes with real responsibility. Not everyone is cut out for it, and not everyone should take on that role. And paradoxically, over the last few months the best POs left, while the worst ones stayed - still pretending to be product owners, even though most of their decision-making power is already gone.",

That's not the point here. The issue is orgs are paying a ton of money for someone who at best brings minimal value, at worst is complete dead weight, and most often doesn't move the needle at all. A lot of teams would be better off ditching the Scrum Master in favor of an additional dev, and integrating the SM responsibilities into the dev team. (A fully dedicated SM who is good at their job is better than devs taking the responsibilities, but a fully dedicated SM who sucks is not.)",

One time he accused of manipulating the user story when I was talking to the QA engineer to explain the testing scope as he was new to the team, he straight. I’ve asked if I was asking the QA to manipulate and move the story forward - that’s where I come from.\n\nI hate confrontations so never said anything and decided to quit being a dev which I wasn’t a fan of so I became a Scrum Master and have been for the past 7 years now. I did this to become everything he was not and be the best and a dependable team member.\n\nReading through your post - it looks like they are just doing “Scrum” or “Agile” just for the sake of doing it. Scrum Masters are there to help, guide and support the teams without any disruptions.\n\nAnyone can share the screen and go through the board, he is not needed per se but he should be there to understand what’s going on and where they are needed.",

People reciting words they don’t mean. Meetings held because they are scheduled. A role reduced to noise and absence. That is not agility. That is corporate malpractice. You have taken something meant to teach judgment and replaced it with ritual. And rituals without belief rot fast.\n\nSo no, the problem is not that Scrum Masters should vanish. The problem is that many were never really there to begin with.",

You've summed them up nicely and I agree wholeheartedly. \n\nSM behaviors and rhetoric like this, spoken aloud and cheered as gospel, are directly responsible for team and leadership confusion during delivery, customer dissatisfaction due to poor releases and capabilities, lack of redirect from product partners, and eventual layoffs across the board. \n\nSide note: early Agile, like in the Snowbird days, used an analogy of a chicken trying to convince a pig to open a breakfast restaurant called Ham 'n Eggs. The pig refused. The chicken asked why and the pig replies, \"Because you would be engaged with the restaurant but I would be committed\". It was supposed to replace RACI ideas and was widely used in training agilists. I used the analogy once during a planning session, and my director lost his head over his perception of what i was saying, in that he thought i was suggesting he was too scared to make a decision.\n\nOne and only time.\n\nIt was a fun, quirky, subversive ha-ha way for some agilists to express perceived superiority over leaders and execs. Today, it's a clear signal of disdain - just as it comes across here, and any whilst worth their salt would never say it. \n\nI think if an SM called a UK engineering team for backlog grooming, that would receive less ire than chickens and pigs.",

You adopt adaptive methods when there's uncertainty or ambiguity in the work, so there's an inherent need to accept this ambiguity and make decisions even when you don't (and won't) have the full picture. There's also usually a greater sense of shared ownership, with the project manager doing less controlling and managing and more sharing knowledge and expertise, so the team can own the work and the process. All of this requires shifting from a doing mindset to a facilitating, teaching, coaching, and sometimes partnering mindset.\n\nAgility sometimes comes with a shift to a product-centric organization, which also changes the role of a project manager. Ownership shifts to product management and long-term product goals, with project management supporting the movement toward those goals rather than serving as the primary funding and organizational structure.",

We are an architecture/engineering setup with long-running projects, billable hours, resource planning, QA steps, and also a lot of invoicing tied to the work so I feel like Jira feels extremely task-heavy and too focused on software projects to help us with that specifically. We don’t really need epics and sprints as much as we need visibility from proposal to delivery and without integrations if possible tbh.

In my years as a SM, I didn't have a single day to day routine other than taking on the actions from standup. That meant coaching POs and BAs in writing stories, working with engineers to examine complexity, running through budgets and burn rates with directors, and helping QA learn BDD to leverage tools fully.\n\nThe only thing I didn't do was code - and even then, I was researching logs, engaging support teams, and managing delivery. \n\nSMs serve the team in whatever capacity. I was trained and obtained my CSM in 2011, CSP in 2015, when Scrum Alliance meant something in the industry.  Trust me when I say that Scrum dogma has no practical place in software and product development. Meeting your team where they are and responding to those needs is the mark of a good real world SMs.\n\nIf you want to do this, find a shop that understand and learn there. If you don't want to be a SM, find another role. \n\nThe only thing more disastrous to a team than a new, unsure SM, is one who has no passion or interest in the role.",

Organizations start to make big changes and then the change fades and they lose attention and momentum. As I read it I thought of how many coaches and scrum masters I've heard tell the same story. However, I also found myself thinking \"This guy needs to be proud of the change he accomplished. Not every company wants or needs to be a B Corp. And over the weekend I thought, \"I should take my own advice.\"\n\nNot every company wants or needs to be Spotify or whatever company you read about. Sure, I worked a company that changed their industry with Scrum and another that saved their company with it, but most just got a little nicer to work at or gained a smoother deployment process, and honestly, good for them.\n\nI also look around at how software is made now vs in the 80's and 90's and wow has Agile made a big change. Anyone else remember just having architects and BAs work on a project for 6 months and then having a thousand-page long requirements doc to hand to developers and then they couldn't ask the architects anything because they were off on another project? You don't see that around much anymore. And testing - remember how we used to do testing? No unit tests, no testing before you call a feature d9ne. Just build the whole damn thing then send 18 months worth of code over to the testing department and watch the bugs come back in swarms. \n\nWe've changed and improved a lot as an industry and Agile has been a big driver of it. People can dislike Agile all they want, but I don't see any of them running back to the old ways of working. Hope that brightens a few people's day.",

Instead of 6 months of planning, 18 months of coding, we now use 1 week of planning, 4 weeks of coding and use sprints to measure that. I'd also say it's somewhat due to tech getting a lot better. Compared to 80s and 90s, we have supercomputers at our disposal and network speeds to match. Makes sense that the development process speeds up as well.\n\nThe problem is, organizations leadership don't want to adapt to an agile mindset. They still operate in that factory era mindset. And it does make sense because the rest of the world, starting from the shareholders, operate in that way. They want future predicions and plans and strategies for months on ahead. They can't just go and wing it, trusting that the entire org pivots if something goes wrong.",

You can use an unlimited number of tools to do this, but realistically they are all ultimately about the people doing the work. Depending on the needs of the team, this may involve aspects of both project and people management, but at no time should the SM have managerial power over the team or the project.

It also makes sense if you need stakeholders managed more closely and often, especially if you have multiple stakeholders fighting for priority of a single backlog. \n\nPI plannings are absolutely terrible if you plan in detail and plan individuals instead of a team (ergo not doing scrum in the first place). If you have a true scrum team, you can quickly plan stories, defined solely with \"description\", asking the team if it is a small enough vertical slice, and just breaking them into small batches. Monte carlo works great here too.  Don't spend time \"precising\" you estimates. Just make small, vertically sliced user stories.",

I'm talking like 70-80% of our workload is firewalls and dns requests that we have to react to.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about how to start a big new project the right way and wanted to throw this out here for discussion.\n\nI’m a senior software engineer working mostly with low-code platforms. In the past, I’ve been involved in several projects, smaller ones went fine, but the last two large ones (1–3 years long) went very bad. I joined both halfway through, mostly to help push them to production, so I couldn’t really influence the structure or process. Now I’ve just joined a new company that’s kicking off a major refactoring and some new features project (expected to last almost two years), and I really want to avoid the same pitfalls.\n\nI’m Italian, and honestly, i’ve always struggled with Agile. Too many rituals, too much overhead, not enough freedom. I used to think waterfall was better, but mostly because I didn’t really understand Agile deeply. So I spent time reading up on Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, XP, etc., and i’ve come to believe Agile makes more sense, especially with low code tools.\n\nBut here’s where I’m stuck: in my experience, Agile often means endless rework because requirements keep changing or were never properly analyzed at the start. Budgets are fixed here, timelines are tight, and we don’t have the luxury of endless iteration. On low-code platforms, even a small change can break multiple parts (data models, rules, UI, etc.), so frequent late changes are really costly.\n\nSo my question is: am I thinking about this wrong? Is there a way to truly apply Agile in this context, or should we invest much more upfront in detailed functional and technical analysis and get everything validated before development?\n\nWould love to hear from people who have faced similar constraints.\n\nThanks!",

You wind up with \"Sprints as a project reporting cadence\" and half the work in twice the time.\n\nXP used to have \"user stories\" that were written on a 3x5 index card, and were a placeholder for a conversation with the \"on site customer\", an SME embedded in the team and collaborating with them daily.  The constraint of the hand-written card had a purpose - it forced small, simple user stories.\n\nAlistair Cockburn championed a lot of this stuff and his \"elephant carpaccio\" exercise is one that really gets into small slices and rapid change.   \n  \nIt's hard to break out of that cycle though.    \n  \nManagement doesn't feel safe if they think change is expensive, hard, slow and risky.   \nThat makes them control things more tightly.  \nSo they are less likely to allow devs to put the work in to make change cheap, easy, fast and safe.

I'm wondering how I can best approach the initial, calmer part of the project, so as to build an effective analysis that doesn't trigger too many change requests in the future.

They would never use a prototype or partial software that doesn't cover their full workflow, either because it's senseless to abandon their current process for something incomplete (forcing them to use a bit of the old and a bit of the new), or because of regulations, GDPR, etc. For example, you can't push forward document processing without the digital signature part, which relies on a third-party service, because we couldn't integrate with that external service, which the client had only mentioned casually, but since we weren't supposed to implement it until later we didn't check exactly how the integration worked, and months later we realized it was impossible with our software.\n\nThe bathroom example fits perfectly:  \nContinuing the example, let's say the client gets to step 8 and then says they want a jacuzzi bathtub, but you explain it's impossible because the bathroom and pipes aren't set up for the tub they want (I'm making this up), and you tell them that after all the work you've already done, to install the tub you'd have to tear everything apart, redo all the pipes, etc., and it would cost three times more with an extra month of work. At that point what do you do, is it your fault for not digging deeper into what kind of tub they wanted, or theirs for not being ready for the budget increase based on their special requests?  \nItalian companies are more the second case, and that's where the penalties come in that they make you pay because you can't deliver exactly what you had agreed on with them.",

That ROI only starts to arrive after the project is completed.\n\nAgile approaches don't make that assumption.  You continually deliver, and continually measure the actual benefits obtained.  This is less efficient, but allows you to stop at any time you think the next lot of benefits are at risk, or the ROI has shifted.\n\nEffectively you are removing the whole sunk-cost fallacy.  In a conventional project when you have spent a lot and have failed to identify or manage key risks, then you are stuck with a choice to spend more (and reduce the ROI) or cancel and write off all costs.    That's often politically unacceptable, so you carry on.\n\nWith an agile approach **you can stop at any time, having obtained high value benefits, with zero sunk costs.**\n\nIn that sense agile approaches can't really fail, when well executed.\n\nWith Scrum, each Sprint offers the business a potential zero-cost off-ramp from the project.\n\nAgile approaches are less efficient at delivery than big-design-upfront, but enable much finer-grained control on risk.  That means you can drop a lot of the stage-gate-and-sign-off and formal risk management stuff which saves you time and money.\n\nThere's a couple of core requirements, however.\n\n**- change is cheap, easy, fast and safe (no new defects)**  \n**- you get fast feedback from users on the value that change created**\n\nThis is where XP and DevOps comes into play.  When it's not expensive, hard, slow or risky to make changes then the need to be 100% right first time, so detailed requirements are less important. XP took this to the extreme, with a sentence on a 3x5 index card, and a user domain SME collocated with the team and dynamically collaborating with them all the time - zero lag on feedback, and real CI/CD to an actual user they are sitting with.\n\nWith Scrum that looks like shipping multiple increments to (some) users within the Sprint and getting feedback on your progress to the Sprint Goal dynamically, so the stakeholders can choose whether to continue investing or to change direction.  Hence the idea that each Sprint is a small project in it's own right, and that the backlog is never completed, only abandoned when it doesn't offer a good ROI.\n\n**If you can't do those two things well, then you are better off with formal stage-gate project management.**",

Which is all agile (and lean) software development actually is. \n\nKnowledge work is not the same as manufacturing, but the wider concepts like systems thinking that Theory of Constraints still apply.\n\nWhat Deming pointed out to Toyota (among other things) was \n\n\\- test-and-rework loops are very expensive  \n\\- building quality in to the system is much cheaper  \n\\- until a thing is in use (ie sold or shipped) it has no value  \n\\- you need to continually improve your processes  \n\\- you need to do that leveraging data and controlled experiments  \n  \nHard disagree on making change cheap, easy, fast and safe though.  That's the build quality in part - you get into the defect prevention business, not the defect discovery business.   \n  \nThat was the whole point of the agile movement from about 2000 onwards, following all of the lessons learned by the dot-com bubble, as well as The Lean StartUp and all of that.  It was a developer led thing too.\n\nThe whole XP \"Planning Game\" focused on delivering an minimal end-to-end Spine, and then adding slices of value that you adapted based on feedback.  The other XP technical practices supported that rapid change, and if you found a new direction was more valuable you'd follow that.  \n  \nMy first software team came to me around 2009 or so and said they wanted to try out this agile thing;  took us about 4 or 5 years to defuse the legacy code base and big-ball of mud, even when we hired a really experienced XP guy.  Worked though.  \n\nTook a lot of painful lessons about that kind of \"big bang, big fail\" products and features on the way though.  And had to kill a few thing I really believed in as well.  Both are hard.  \n  \n\"If you build it they will come\" is essentially rubbish.  They won't.     \n  \n\"If you can't find a customer who will co-develop with you and chip in money don't do it\" is closer.\n\n",

              "text": "When you talk about ROI being delivered incrementally in Agile, so you can stop if something isn't bringing value and avoid the sunk cost fallacy, which is definitely a huge issue in our field, that makes sense in theory. But at least for Italian projects, it doesn't really work that way. Clients only pay us at the end of the project, or maybe at specific milestones, not based on what we've delivered along the way. And even if they pay upfront, if we don't deliver exactly what's been agreed on, it goes to lawyers and penalties kick in.\n\nI work with public administration, banks, insurance companies, etc., so the idea that the client at least has something usable from Agile doesn't hold up. They would never use a prototype or partial software that doesn't cover their full workflow. It's just not practical to switch from their current process to something incomplete (forcing them to use a bit of the old and a bit of the new), plus there are regulations, GDPR, etc. For example, you can't push forward document processing without the digital signature part, which relies on a third-party service. We only got mentioned about that integration later on, since it wasn't supposed to be implemented until much later, so we didn't check how it actually worked. Months later we realized it was impossible with our software setup.\n\nThe \"sentence on a 3x5 index card\" approach is something we've tried in a few cases, but it was a total disaster. Unless that user domain SME has full decision-making power and basically signs off on every change with their own blood, this kind of process usually runs into complete disagreement from all the other business users who will actually use the app, leading to massive rework.\n\nSo that's my main hesitation, and maybe it's just a specific case where the methodology isn't fully adaptable, or needs serious tweaking. Could also be because of the super tight constraints of low-code platforms. Overall, my concern boils down to: if I'm building a skyscraper",

You then have two pipelines for deployment, one which routes the \"as built\" and change documents to the sign-off authorities, and one that deploys code.  Both have to run to deploy to production.  \n  \nBut you are spot on - that user domain SME has to have the authority to act;  actually \"Own\" the product unlike a lot of the \"backlog managers\" you get, which means they are making business decisions inside and with the team, next to the customer.\n\nThat's what I have right now - we have empowered POs from \"the business' embedded within the teams accountable for value and making those decisions.  And it's the business making the tough priority calls when they need to, based on how our money works.  It's frankly great.  The teams feel a lot less pressure and so on.\n\nBig culture shift.  Our CEO back in the mid 1990s executed on this kind of culture so we on the technical side all got business training, the the business folk.  So much doesn't need to be said when you do that, the payoff is HUGE.  \n  \nMostly the banks where I am are going all in on SAFe, with a sprinkling of team topologies and value streams.\n\nBut yeah how you do projects matters;  we're in the process of swapping to a more value-stream approach because now we don't have on-prem servers and use IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS the CAPEX-OPEX model of old is a bit broken. And how the money works really, really matters. \n\nAnd the skyscraper thing is spot on.  \n  \nIf you aren't able to work with easily extensible architecture and you are pouring foundations in concrete then you can't add a couple of extra floors later on in the process.\n\nDoes sound like you are better off with waterfall;  you can still look at things like Kanban to help you smooth the delays and kinks out of the delivery - often it's not the \"time on tools\" that matters, its the delays.   Good kanban and flow can shift delivery by \\~20% or so, and really help with triaging defects when you are in a white-water period.\n\nPart of the issue I have now (big DW swap out) is they built by architectural layers for efficiency rather than running a strangler fig pattern (to manage risk);  anything you can do to break the project down into smaller, high value components helps.  \n  \nTMFASD talked about \"a few weeks to a few months\" and that's valid. Keep each chunk under $1m and have value at the end helps;  Scrum shrinks this to a couple of weeks but that's often too small for big projects (but essential for R+D)   \n  \nDon't fast prototype though - have disposable POCs to derisk delivery technology timeboxed to a couple of days, and build everything else to production standard. \n\nNothing as horrible as a hacked together POC pushed to prod lol.\n\n\n\n",

What you describe (endless rework, fluctuating requirements, ignored budgets and fixed timelines) isn't Agile working poorly: it's Agile used as an excuse for not making decisions.\nAgile doesn't mean:\n- requirements that are always open and never stabilized;\n- infinite iterations without constraints;\n- \"let's see what happens as we go\" on complex systems that are costly to modify.\nAgile works when it's clear what can and can't change, when there's a solid initial baseline (especially in data, architecture, and integrations), and when iterations serve to refine value, not rewrite the foundations.\n\nIn low-code, this is even more true: a \"small change\" is often systemic. Pretending that the cost of change is always low is simply false.\n\nThe path I see isn't Agile vs. Waterfall, but something much more pragmatic:\n- serious functional and technical analysis for everything structural (domain, data, integrations, constraints);\n- true Agile on features, flows, user experience, and business priorities;\n- a living backlog, yes, but governed, not anarchic;\n- timeboxes and budgets respected as real constraints, not as \"anti-Agile.\"\n\nIn short:\nAgile is the right path only if adapted to the real context.\nIf it becomes a religion that ignores complexity, costs, and accountability, then yes: it does more harm than Waterfall.\n\nYour final question is therefore spot on: investing better at the beginning is not anti-Agile.

          "text": "I’m a customer based PO.  Been developing software as a customer business architect for 30 years. We used to start with a business problem.  We needed to make a business process more efficient.  We would identify the scope and objectives. We would identify pain points and opportunities for automation. We would visualize end state by documenting as is process flows and to be process flows. We would identify software projects as incremental deliverables to reach our end state process flow.  Then we would take a highest priority software project and determine detailed business requirements and functional requirements. We would then break these down further into story board type chunks and actionable batch functions. Like I need a process that calculates something or feeds or extracts something. Here is the data I need or here is the data I need to send and the format or here are the business rules for the calculation or here is the data I need to capture and the business rules to edit input or here is what I need displayed including derived fields and the business rules to derive etc.\n\nOften the business can’t use the product until the feed comes in, data is displayed or input, calculations are executed and outbound feed is built.  All is successfully tested ie qa in pieces, UAT in pieces and then full integration testing. Controls pass and financial integrity is ensured.  \n\nOur leadership does not understand any of the steps before build it now that we are agile.  I’m not sure they understood it before but they were not aware of that piece because when we were waterfall we just gave them the proposal to build the incremental process identified as an automation opportunity as a proposal and got permission/money to build it then told them a time frame ie 18-24 months for example.  Then we would spend 3 months of that time just defining requirements and business rules. It was really business flushing out the details. “My bathtub needs to be a jacuzzi”. \n\nNow that we are agile and they are more involved they don’t believe in investing in the analysis needed up front. They think they can skip the process analysis.  They skip to focusing on a specific business pain point and start solutioning tactically based on the existing business process and trying to automate that….\n\nexample…”I get reports and key them into excel and then do work and update excel with results.  The excel is too big and not well controlled. So I need a tool I can up load excel reports to then key additinal data I research and actions I took to manually research additional stuff or decisions I have made.  I want an access database”. They get told access is not a tool we use.  They say ok… something like access then. \n\nNow they want to hand that idea “as is” to an agile team and start creating the thing immediately. But in my role I’m supposed to write the epic and tell the team what we want if this project makes the priority list for the next Product increment in six weeks.  I won’t know until a few days before. And then the team will struggle because refinement and analysis is also not understood as necessary so those hours are not billable. I’m expected to keep this team working at capacity where capacity at 5 hours per day per Dev and QA resource cannot include analysis. \n\nIt’s slowly devolved into this situation as the leaders used to just ignore the process analysis and incremental opportunity analysis.  They were unaware of the detailed business rule identification and functional requirements identification phase. And they eliminated the technical expert design roles ie hands on design architecture people who we partnered with during that phase to share the business rules and functional with to collaborate to develop a design roadmap before the build. \n\nBusiness leaders think all that needs to happen is for them to prioritize a high level solution and them the team builds in agile increments that should result in a new tool in 3 months or less.  They are in the stage of customer maturity where they think everything is an easy to build as it is for them to say what they want. Ie just upload the spreadsheet and create a menu screen for us to type into.  We will want reports from the data.  Shouid take 3 months. It’s easy.  \n\nI’m thinking where does the data in the report come from?  Is there data you key or with you had that you don’t get sent in the report. What is the business purpose or process this supports. Can we get this data fed to us vs uploading reports. Can we match it up using keys to other systems to retrieve any missing data etc etc. im a business architect being asked to admin the team building a solution.  \n\nThis is a perfect example to me as to why agile fails all the time. If we did all the missing pieces, the build could be agile. Ie bring in data, show it, capture data via matching, show it, etc etc. that is the agile delivery and it can be done in small increments. And it can be adjusted as demoed. Etc. \n\nBut the “we don’t need requirements” and “people over process” is being used to eliminate all the investment needed to identify and break the work down.  All that  is missing. And when I say we need all that not only do people not understand why we need it to build but also don’t think we need it to maintain.  But I constantly look back at past functional requirements to remember the business rules of what is in production to answer questions and to request enhancements. \n\nHow did agile, which is a great tool for transparent software development, get implemented in such a way as to kill the rest of the process that I don’t think it was ever intended to eliminate?",

Have a product owner who is good at saying \"that looks good, let's more on to the next thing\".

But that means you need to have someone who can make the tradeoff decisions on where to focus.\n\nYou may also find that doing exercises like user story mapping or even just high-level user journey sketches early on give you a big-pucture view to work with to make those tradeoff conversations clearer.",

Ship something\n2. Reflect\n\nI find it interesting that working with LLMs has only reinforced the idea that you will never be able to create the perfect requirements document. Therefore, build something, preferable small, get it into the hands of the intended consumers of the work, and get their feedback.\n\nReflect is intended for the people/organization to look at what they did in the first step and seek out improvements. Retrospectives are one way of doing that, but there are many more. Regardless, if you don't honestly look at how to improve you work together, then step 1 will become more difficult over time.\n\nNow, HOW you accomplish steps 1 and 2 are going to depend wildly on your circumstances, or, dare I say it, *context*! The context for a small startup trying to establish a market for its web-based application is much different from that of an established telecom company writing phone switch software that handles 911 calls.\n\nAny \"canned\" process is going to have difficulty with this, even my beloved XP! For example, I was a strong believer in co-located teams until the COVID pandemic proved that in many cases we can be nearly as productive while remote (and with lower stress due to commuting). This is why I grew to love what Lean can teach us about observation and systems thinking on top of rote application of a process.\n\nSo, all that to answer that the only right way is to try something and reflect honestly on it. Did what your tried bring value? Did it improve morale? Did it improve lead & cycle times? Did it improve quality? Based on the answers to questions like those, adjust how you work then ask the questions again when you have new data.",

Not to learn anything. Just to have a KPI to make it look like we’re doing something.\n\nThey also created a “demand intake process” and tried to make it Agile. It used to be a ticket queue with paperwork. Now it is a ticket queue with epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria that read like a legal contract.

Get's pretty \"heavy weight\" with a lot of sunk costs.\n\nProduct discovery is complex, so probe-sense-respond is the way to go.  And the best probe in an agile context is working, production grade software,  Not wireframes, or PoCs, or requirements, or any of that.\n\nMy go-to approaches tend to be: \n\n**- rapid lean canvas session,** so we are all on the same page on the problem being solved, why it matters, the benefits we want, how we'll measure them, key assumptions/risk and the user domain SMEs (or personas) we will be actively collaborating with when we work;  maybe 2 x 45 minute sessions, with a \"into backlog\" or \"rejected\" outcome\n\n**- user story mapping** with a couple of those SMEs, and the \"three amigo\": pattern;  record the session\n\n**- XP delivery;**  user domain SMEs embedded in and co-creating with the team, thin value slices, \"end-to-end\" skeleton first then add stuff by risk/value and get ultra fast feedback.\n\nIf the business is worried about investment risk then wrap Scrum round the outside, so you can make \"continue/stop/pivot\" decisions in a short cycle and invest one Sprint at a time, while delivering multiple increments per Sprint.\n\nWhich is all \"agile\" really ever was; make change cheap, easy fast and safe (no new defects) and get ultra-fast feedback on what is valuable. \n\nExercises like \"elephant carpaccio\" really bring this home for developers, as does the \"journey to work\" exercise in Jeff Patton's book on user story mapping\n\n[https://blog.crisp.se/2013/07/25/henrikkniberg/elephant-carpaccio-facilitation-guide](https://blog.crisp.se/2013/07/25/henrikkniberg/elephant-carpaccio-facilitation-guide) \n\n",

After 30 years of experience, mostly in startups and sometimes as a co-founder, I've learned that juniors can be *more* expensive than seniors.  There aren't enough seniors to mentor and guide them.  Tech debt gets out of control, even with PR reviews.\n\nIf possible, I would avoid having a team of fewer than 2 FTE developers.  It seems like you are stepping away into an architectural role.\n\nIt can be problematic to be too authoritarian over the long term.  You said you will do all PR reviews.  You should, for sure.  Just don't have a \"my way or the highway\" attitude.  Teams work best when it's flat; all members have equal say into the code's direction.  Of course you are the tie-breaker when debate wheel-spins.  If you can't let go, you aren't going to be a good leader and people will resent it.\n\nDon't **ever** hire a junior unless you have a spec-complete automated test suite and thorough linting, enforced in CI.   You should have those anyway.  Otherwise tech debt will be very hard to manage.\n\n---\n\nMy suggestion:\n\n* Hire 1 senior developer, while you are still be able to code most of the time.  When you code less than 20 hours a week, then hire a 2nd senior.\n* You ack as architect, but all developers' opinions are considered equal when it comes to changing coding standards and structure.  Pass all your new ideas to the team for discussion.\n* All code, including yours, must go through PR review approvals before being merged.  Enforce this in CI.\n* You must have automated tests and linters, enforced in CI.\n* You must have a ticketing system (even if's just trello or a google drive spreadsheet), and good use of version control.",
