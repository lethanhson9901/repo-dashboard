They had low effort jobs and got paid a livable wage . Good for them. \n\nBut now are the dark ages.

But all too often, you see SMs not willing to understand the actual work, the tech, the product, the outcomes.  it isn't just that you can facilitate and coach.  \n\nI would tweek the things that you say have changed to:\n\n1. they want scrum masters to ALSO be accountable with the team for outcomes - the SM, team, coach, everyone is in it together and if the outcomes are not achieved, ALL of them have failed.  SM and Coaches that focus on form and think that being successful at Agile is the goal... are flat out wrong.\n\n2. product model is more prominent while Agile has become a bad word and a tech thing - the funny thing is that product doesn't mean no Agile... Agile has this thing called a PRODUCT owner.  the notion of a product model becoming the new paradigm is more about the elimination of \"projects\", the continuous planning,, continuous delivery, etc.  \n\n",

Before, everyone was trying to do huge waterfall projects that often burned out dev teams and delivered the wrong project.  It worked.  But when finances tighten, humanity shrinks and I’m afraid we are heading right back to the old days again.  \n\nPlus, we’re in a new phase now in the industry.  Most of the truly groundbreaking systems are kinda like standardized systems now, so requirements are easier to come by.  Agile is really good at discovery and innovation and bringing together diverse stakeholders.  So now, the next gen of software is kinda already specd, and just needs to get ported over to AI. Smart, dedicated developers will be able to do the work better without all the management overhead that Agile Inc became.  Sadly though, those overperformers will lead us right back to sloppy slaughterhouse conditions that many fought so hard to get away from.",

      "text": "Here, on the vast plains of the Q3 roadmap, a remarkable ritual is about to unfold. The engineering tribe has gathered around the glow of the digital watering hole for the ceremony known as Sprint Planning. It is here that we can observe one of the most mysterious and misunderstood creatures in the entire corporate ecosystem: the Story Point.\n\nFor decades, management scientists have mistaken this complex organism for a simple unit of time or effort. This is a grave error. The Story Point is not a number; it is a complex social signal, a display of dominance, a cry for help, or a desperate act of camouflage.\n\nAfter years of careful observation, we have classified several distinct species.\n\n**1. The Optimistic Two-Pointer (Estimatus Minimus)**\n\nA small, deceptively placid creature, often identified by its deceptively simple ticket description. Its native call is, \"Oh, that's trivial, it's just a small UI tweak.\" The Two-Pointer appears harmless, leading the tribe to believe it can be captured with minimal effort. However, it is the primary prey of the apex predator known as \"Unforeseen Complexity.\" More often than not, the Two-Pointer reveals its true, monstrous form mid-sprint, devouring the hopes of the team and leaving behind a carcass of broken promises.\n\n**2. The Defensive Eight-Pointer (Fibonacci Maximus)**\n\nThis is not an estimate; it is a territorial display. The Eight-Pointer puffs up its chest, inflates its scope, and stands as a formidable warning to any Product Manager who might attempt to introduce scope creep. Its large size is a form of threat posturing, communicating not \"this will take a long time,\" but \"do not approach this ticket with your 'quick suggestions' or you will be gored.\" It is a protective measure, evolved to defend a developer's most precious resource: their sanity.\n\n**3. The Ambiguous Five-Pointer (Puntus Medius)**\n\nThe chameleon of the estimation world. The Five-Pointer is the physical embodiment of a shrug. It is neither confidently small nor defensively large. It is a signal of pure, unadulterated uncertainty. A developer who offers a Five-Pointer is not providing an estimate; they are casting a vote for \"I have no idea, and I am afraid to commit.\" It survives by blending into the middle of the backlog, hoping to be overlooked.\n\n**4. The Mythical One-Pointer (Unicornis Simplex)**\n\nA legendary creature, whose existence is the subject of much debate among crypto-zoologists of Agile. Sightings are incredibly rare. The legend describes a task so perfectly understood, so devoid of hidden dependencies, and so utterly simple that it can be captured and completed in a single afternoon. Most senior engineers believe it to be a myth, a story told to junior developers to give them hope.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOur research indicates that the Story Point has very little to do with the actual effort required to complete a task. It is a complex language of risk, fear, and social negotiation, practiced by a tribe that is being forced to navigate a dark, unmapped territory. The entire, elaborate ritual of estimation is a coping mechanism for a fundamental lack of visibility.\n\nThey are, in essence, guessing the size of a shadow without ever being allowed to see the object casting it.\n\n\n\nThought we could use some humor to start the week (this is all tongue-in-cheek ).  If I have overstepped, please let me know and I will take this down.",

The problem is well defined and small in scope (I say problem here, not solution, a story describes your users work, not your work).\n\nIf it's \"Too Fucking Big\" then the team understands the problem to be solved but feels that the problem is too large and needs to find ways to split it into more manageable problems of smaller scope, looking for a smaller MVP. \n\nIf it's \"No Fucking Clue\" then the team has no clear understanding of the scope of the problem and some investment must be made to investigate the problem space and come up with next steps. Some testing and iteration need to occur to determine what an MVP and the next iterations should even look like.\n\nThe goal is to have every story be a 1, if it's a 1 it's ready to be worked on, if it's one of the others, work needs to happen to make it a 1 (or more accurately to define multiple 1's). The main priority is to \"right-size\" the stories and get them feeling fairly uniform, with them all focused on defining a user-facing problem to be solved.\n\nThen to measure the teams performance and make estimations of projected performance it becomes just a matter of counting how many stories are completed within a time frame, how long stories stay in different phases of work, how many stories are waiting on being done, etc",

(The purpose of standup, how to use tools like Jira, when/how to communicate blockers to them, etc.)\n- Has the Scrum Master helped empower the team to own the work?\n- If the Scrum Master is skipping standup, what are they doing instead?\n\nOften the answers are \"No, No, Jack S***\". \n\nA team can absolutely exist without a Scrum Master. That's not the point here. The issue is orgs are paying a ton of money for someone who at best brings minimal value, at worst is complete dead weight, and most often doesn't move the needle at all. A lot of teams would be better off ditching the Scrum Master in favor of an additional dev, and integrating the SM responsibilities into the dev team. (A fully dedicated SM who is good at their job is better than devs taking the responsibilities, but a fully dedicated SM who sucks is not.)",

He constantly taunted us (team) like, he would come sit next to us and asked, explain the code and what it does or why is it not working (Idk haven’t had a chance to debug yet). One time he accused of manipulating the user story when I was talking to the QA engineer to explain the testing scope as he was new to the team, he straight. I’ve asked if I was asking the QA to manipulate and move the story forward - that’s where I come from.\n\nI hate confrontations so never said anything and decided to quit being a dev which I wasn’t a fan of so I became a Scrum Master and have been for the past 7 years now. I did this to become everything he was not and be the best and a dependable team member.\n\nReading through your post - it looks like they are just doing “Scrum” or “Agile” just for the sake of doing it. Scrum Masters are there to help, guide and support the teams without any disruptions.\n\nAnyone can share the screen and go through the board, he is not needed per se but he should be there to understand what’s going on and where they are needed.",

An engineer need not apply.\n\nEdit: thanks for the downvotes. here's the post: https://jobs.cvshealth.com/us/en/job/R0816661/Senior-Analyst-Scrum-Master",

You're not only punishing them, but also potentially the entire team.\n\nWhat does \"being a chicken\" even mean? This honestly sounds like bullying and intimidation.

You've summed them up nicely and I agree wholeheartedly. \n\nSM behaviors and rhetoric like this, spoken aloud and cheered as gospel, are directly responsible for team and leadership confusion during delivery, customer dissatisfaction due to poor releases and capabilities, lack of redirect from product partners, and eventual layoffs across the board. \n\nSide note: early Agile, like in the Snowbird days, used an analogy of a chicken trying to convince a pig to open a breakfast restaurant called Ham 'n Eggs. The pig refused. The chicken asked why and the pig replies, \"Because you would be engaged with the restaurant but I would be committed\". It was supposed to replace RACI ideas and was widely used in training agilists. I used the analogy once during a planning session, and my director lost his head over his perception of what i was saying, in that he thought i was suggesting he was too scared to make a decision.\n\nOne and only time.\n\nIt was a fun, quirky, subversive ha-ha way for some agilists to express perceived superiority over leaders and execs. Today, it's a clear signal of disdain - just as it comes across here, and any whilst worth their salt would never say it. \n\nI think if an SM called a UK engineering team for backlog grooming, that would receive less ire than chickens and pigs.",

You adopt adaptive methods when there's uncertainty or ambiguity in the work, so there's an inherent need to accept this ambiguity and make decisions even when you don't (and won't) have the full picture. There's also usually a greater sense of shared ownership, with the project manager doing less controlling and managing and more sharing knowledge and expertise, so the team can own the work and the process. All of this requires shifting from a doing mindset to a facilitating, teaching, coaching, and sometimes partnering mindset.\n\nAgility sometimes comes with a shift to a product-centric organization, which also changes the role of a project manager. Ownership shifts to product management and long-term product goals, with project management supporting the movement toward those goals rather than serving as the primary funding and organizational structure.",

I have another scrum master semi guiding me but I feel like he honestly thinks im stupid for not knowing how to do things or getting flustered with tasks that he views as straight forward. I try to ask him to help me as Ive never done any of this and he says i have to \"take initiative\" and that he cant \"hold my hand through it\" this has made me not want to reach out to him as I dont really get guidance, its more of a scolding and a \"you should be doing this and this\" my PO is great and understands I dont have any answers and am just trying to learn HOW things work so Im thankful for him. But I just feel so stupid and useless whenever I try to do things and they end up being \"all wrong\". Its my first time doing ANY of it how am I supposed to know what I need to do and how I need to do it? Its frustrating and I just need to vent. Do it get easier?  thanks for reading. ",

The glib, handwavy \"details don't matter' have the loudest voice.\n\nAnd is anyone after 2 days in a room really going to stand up in front of their whole ART and senior managers and call bullshit on the plan, knowing that means another day of planning?  Nope.\n\nSo feel your pain there, OP. \n\nAND -\n\n**There's always money for the \"leading SAFe\" certs for managers - which has the same impact as all classroom learning (zero) - but do the developers get XP training?  Nope.**\n\nThe ONE thing that could really shift an org is getting those XP/DevOps skills nailed down, but instead you get leaders collecting badges as CV points.  Silly.  You'd be better of hiring some good XP people and doing cheap modern leadership courses for everyone.  **(Done both.  Works great.)**\n\nPLUS - \n\n**Transformations don't work.  They really, really don't.**    \n  \nThey pick the low hanging fruit - restructure, new jobs, new events/meetings and it's out with Gant Charts, in with Scrum Boards. But - keep the power structures, control systems and narrative about utilisation, motivation, flow and work.\n\nWhen you only change half the cultural web, then you don't really get change.    \nEspecially when you don't do the difficult bits.\n\nSo mostly SAFe transformations are ugly, like you say.",

It also makes sense if you need stakeholders managed more closely and often, especially if you have multiple stakeholders fighting for priority of a single backlog. \n\nPI plannings are absolutely terrible if you plan in detail and plan individuals instead of a team (ergo not doing scrum in the first place). If you have a true scrum team, you can quickly plan stories, defined solely with \"description\", asking the team if it is a small enough vertical slice, and just breaking them into small batches. Monte carlo works great here too.  Don't spend time \"precising\" you estimates. Just make small, vertically sliced user stories.",

I'm talking like 70-80% of our workload is firewalls and dns requests that we have to react to. The other team also still gets unplanned work, but we are able to plan to some degree - though it seems like this particular team has lack of clear direction from leadership on what priorities are.\n\nI don't know.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about how to start a big new project the right way and wanted to throw this out here for discussion.\n\nI’m a senior software engineer working mostly with low-code platforms. In the past, I’ve been involved in several projects, smaller ones went fine, but the last two large ones (1–3 years long) went very bad. I joined both halfway through, mostly to help push them to production, so I couldn’t really influence the structure or process. Now I’ve just joined a new company that’s kicking off a major refactoring and some new features project (expected to last almost two years), and I really want to avoid the same pitfalls.\n\nI’m Italian, and honestly, i’ve always struggled with Agile. Too many rituals, too much overhead, not enough freedom. I used to think waterfall was better, but mostly because I didn’t really understand Agile deeply. So I spent time reading up on Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, XP, etc., and i’ve come to believe Agile makes more sense, especially with low code tools.\n\nBut here’s where I’m stuck: in my experience, Agile often means endless rework because requirements keep changing or were never properly analyzed at the start. Budgets are fixed here, timelines are tight, and we don’t have the luxury of endless iteration. On low-code platforms, even a small change can break multiple parts (data models, rules, UI, etc.), so frequent late changes are really costly.\n\nSo my question is: am I thinking about this wrong? Is there a way to truly apply Agile in this context, or should we invest much more upfront in detailed functional and technical analysis and get everything validated before development?\n\nWould love to hear from people who have faced similar constraints.\n\nThanks!",

You wind up with \"Sprints as a project reporting cadence\" and half the work in twice the time.\n\nXP used to have \"user stories\" that were written on a 3x5 index card, and were a placeholder for a conversation with the \"on site customer\", an SME embedded in the team and collaborating with them daily.  The constraint of the hand-written card had a purpose - it forced small, simple user stories.\n\nAlistair Cockburn championed a lot of this stuff and his \"elephant carpaccio\" exercise is one that really gets into small slices and rapid change.   \n  \nIt's hard to break out of that cycle though.    \n  \nManagement doesn't feel safe if they think change is expensive, hard, slow and risky.   \nThat makes them control things more tightly.  \nSo they are less likely to allow devs to put the work in to make change cheap, easy, fast and safe.

I believe the problem I encountered was more related to the fault of project managers, who are often completely dominated by clients and the possibility of making them unhappy. In a calm initial phase (within the first few months of the project, when there are no pressing deadlines), they let everything slide, since they're relaxed and not thinking about the future. Then, in the final phase (with a lot of pressure and stringent deadlines), when the client is irritated by things not working, they accept every one of their dictates, for fear of starting a legal dispute.\n\nSo my question is, how do I, as a developer/tech leader, take charge of the situation and prevent this from happening? I'm wondering how I can best approach the initial, calmer part of the project, so as to build an effective analysis that doesn't trigger too many change requests in the future. In other words, how do I ensure that the work done in the initial phase is effective so as not to have a disastrous final phase.",

That ROI only starts to arrive after the project is completed.\n\nAgile approaches don't make that assumption.  You continually deliver, and continually measure the actual benefits obtained.  This is less efficient, but allows you to stop at any time you think the next lot of benefits are at risk, or the ROI has shifted.\n\nEffectively you are removing the whole sunk-cost fallacy.  In a conventional project when you have spent a lot and have failed to identify or manage key risks, then you are stuck with a choice to spend more (and reduce the ROI) or cancel and write off all costs.    That's often politically unacceptable, so you carry on.\n\nWith an agile approach **you can stop at any time, having obtained high value benefits, with zero sunk costs.**\n\nIn that sense agile approaches can't really fail, when well executed.\n\nWith Scrum, each Sprint offers the business a potential zero-cost off-ramp from the project.\n\nAgile approaches are less efficient at delivery than big-design-upfront, but enable much finer-grained control on risk.  That means you can drop a lot of the stage-gate-and-sign-off and formal risk management stuff which saves you time and money.\n\nThere's a couple of core requirements, however.\n\n**- change is cheap, easy, fast and safe (no new defects)**  \n**- you get fast feedback from users on the value that change created**\n\nThis is where XP and DevOps comes into play.  When it's not expensive, hard, slow or risky to make changes then the need to be 100% right first time, so detailed requirements are less important. XP took this to the extreme, with a sentence on a 3x5 index card, and a user domain SME collocated with the team and dynamically collaborating with them all the time - zero lag on feedback, and real CI/CD to an actual user they are sitting with.\n\nWith Scrum that looks like shipping multiple increments to (some) users within the Sprint and getting feedback on your progress to the Sprint Goal dynamically, so the stakeholders can choose whether to continue investing or to change direction.  Hence the idea that each Sprint is a small project in it's own right, and that the backlog is never completed, only abandoned when it doesn't offer a good ROI.\n\n**If you can't do those two things well, then you are better off with formal stage-gate project management.**",

You then have two pipelines for deployment, one which routes the \"as built\" and change documents to the sign-off authorities, and one that deploys code.  Both have to run to deploy to production.  \n  \nBut you are spot on - that user domain SME has to have the authority to act;  actually \"Own\" the product unlike a lot of the \"backlog managers\" you get, which means they are making business decisions inside and with the team, next to the customer.\n\nThat's what I have right now - we have empowered POs from \"the business' embedded within the teams accountable for value and making those decisions.  And it's the business making the tough priority calls when they need to, based on how our money works.  It's frankly great.  The teams feel a lot less pressure and so on.\n\nBig culture shift.  Our CEO back in the mid 1990s executed on this kind of culture so we on the technical side all got business training, the the business folk.  So much doesn't need to be said when you do that, the payoff is HUGE.  \n  \nMostly the banks where I am are going all in on SAFe, with a sprinkling of team topologies and value streams.\n\nBut yeah how you do projects matters;  we're in the process of swapping to a more value-stream approach because now we don't have on-prem servers and use IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS the CAPEX-OPEX model of old is a bit broken. And how the money works really, really matters. \n\nAnd the skyscraper thing is spot on.  \n  \nIf you aren't able to work with easily extensible architecture and you are pouring foundations in concrete then you can't add a couple of extra floors later on in the process.\n\nDoes sound like you are better off with waterfall;  you can still look at things like Kanban to help you smooth the delays and kinks out of the delivery - often it's not the \"time on tools\" that matters, its the delays.   Good kanban and flow can shift delivery by \\~20% or so, and really help with triaging defects when you are in a white-water period.\n\nPart of the issue I have now (big DW swap out) is they built by architectural layers for efficiency rather than running a strangler fig pattern (to manage risk);  anything you can do to break the project down into smaller, high value components helps.  \n  \nTMFASD talked about \"a few weeks to a few months\" and that's valid. Keep each chunk under $1m and have value at the end helps;  Scrum shrinks this to a couple of weeks but that's often too small for big projects (but essential for R+D)   \n  \nDon't fast prototype though - have disposable POCs to derisk delivery technology timeboxed to a couple of days, and build everything else to production standard. \n\nNothing as horrible as a hacked together POC pushed to prod lol.\n\n\n\n",

What you describe (endless rework, fluctuating requirements, ignored budgets and fixed timelines) isn't Agile working poorly: it's Agile used as an excuse for not making decisions.\nAgile doesn't mean:\n- requirements that are always open and never stabilized;\n- infinite iterations without constraints;\n- \"let's see what happens as we go\" on complex systems that are costly to modify.\nAgile works when it's clear what can and can't change, when there's a solid initial baseline (especially in data, architecture, and integrations), and when iterations serve to refine value, not rewrite the foundations.\n\nIn low-code, this is even more true: a \"small change\" is often systemic. Pretending that the cost of change is always low is simply false.\n\nThe path I see isn't Agile vs. Waterfall, but something much more pragmatic:\n- serious functional and technical analysis for everything structural (domain, data, integrations, constraints);\n- true Agile on features, flows, user experience, and business priorities;\n- a living backlog, yes, but governed, not anarchic;\n- timeboxes and budgets respected as real constraints, not as \"anti-Agile.\"\n\nIn short:\nAgile is the right path only if adapted to the real context.\nIf it becomes a religion that ignores complexity, costs, and accountability, then yes: it does more harm than Waterfall.\n\nYour final question is therefore spot on: investing better at the beginning is not anti-Agile.

          "text": "I’m a customer based PO.  Been developing software as a customer business architect for 30 years. We used to start with a business problem.  We needed to make a business process more efficient.  We would identify the scope and objectives. We would identify pain points and opportunities for automation. We would visualize end state by documenting as is process flows and to be process flows. We would identify software projects as incremental deliverables to reach our end state process flow.  Then we would take a highest priority software project and determine detailed business requirements and functional requirements. We would then break these down further into story board type chunks and actionable batch functions. Like I need a process that calculates something or feeds or extracts something. Here is the data I need or here is the data I need to send and the format or here are the business rules for the calculation or here is the data I need to capture and the business rules to edit input or here is what I need displayed including derived fields and the business rules to derive etc.\n\nOften the business can’t use the product until the feed comes in, data is displayed or input, calculations are executed and outbound feed is built.  All is successfully tested ie qa in pieces, UAT in pieces and then full integration testing. Controls pass and financial integrity is ensured.  \n\nOur leadership does not understand any of the steps before build it now that we are agile.  I’m not sure they understood it before but they were not aware of that piece because when we were waterfall we just gave them the proposal to build the incremental process identified as an automation opportunity as a proposal and got permission/money to build it then told them a time frame ie 18-24 months for example.  Then we would spend 3 months of that time just defining requirements and business rules. It was really business flushing out the details. “My bathtub needs to be a jacuzzi”. \n\nNow that we are agile and they are more involved they don’t believe in investing in the analysis needed up front. They think they can skip the process analysis.  They skip to focusing on a specific business pain point and start solutioning tactically based on the existing business process and trying to automate that….\n\nexample…”I get reports and key them into excel and then do work and update excel with results.  The excel is too big and not well controlled. So I need a tool I can up load excel reports to then key additinal data I research and actions I took to manually research additional stuff or decisions I have made.  I want an access database”. They get told access is not a tool we use.  They say ok… something like access then. \n\nNow they want to hand that idea “as is” to an agile team and start creating the thing immediately. But in my role I’m supposed to write the epic and tell the team what we want if this project makes the priority list for the next Product increment in six weeks.  I won’t know until a few days before. And then the team will struggle because refinement and analysis is also not understood as necessary so those hours are not billable. I’m expected to keep this team working at capacity where capacity at 5 hours per day per Dev and QA resource cannot include analysis. \n\nIt’s slowly devolved into this situation as the leaders used to just ignore the process analysis and incremental opportunity analysis.  They were unaware of the detailed business rule identification and functional requirements identification phase. And they eliminated the technical expert design roles ie hands on design architecture people who we partnered with during that phase to share the business rules and functional with to collaborate to develop a design roadmap before the build. \n\nBusiness leaders think all that needs to happen is for them to prioritize a high level solution and them the team builds in agile increments that should result in a new tool in 3 months or less.  They are in the stage of customer maturity where they think everything is an easy to build as it is for them to say what they want. Ie just upload the spreadsheet and create a menu screen for us to type into.  We will want reports from the data.  Shouid take 3 months. It’s easy.  \n\nI’m thinking where does the data in the report come from?  Is there data you key or with you had that you don’t get sent in the report. What is the business purpose or process this supports. Can we get this data fed to us vs uploading reports. Can we match it up using keys to other systems to retrieve any missing data etc etc. im a business architect being asked to admin the team building a solution.  \n\nThis is a perfect example to me as to why agile fails all the time. If we did all the missing pieces, the build could be agile. Ie bring in data, show it, capture data via matching, show it, etc etc. that is the agile delivery and it can be done in small increments. And it can be adjusted as demoed. Etc. \n\nBut the “we don’t need requirements” and “people over process” is being used to eliminate all the investment needed to identify and break the work down.  All that  is missing. And when I say we need all that not only do people not understand why we need it to build but also don’t think we need it to maintain.  But I constantly look back at past functional requirements to remember the business rules of what is in production to answer questions and to request enhancements. \n\nHow did agile, which is a great tool for transparent software development, get implemented in such a way as to kill the rest of the process that I don’t think it was ever intended to eliminate?",

I was among the early (and successful) adopters of XP.\n\nAll the experience I've gathered over those years has taught me that there are just two fundamental \"steps\" to successfully deliver software systems.\n\n1. Ship something\n2. Reflect\n\nI find it interesting that working with LLMs has only reinforced the idea that you will never be able to create the perfect requirements document. Therefore, build something, preferable small, get it into the hands of the intended consumers of the work, and get their feedback.\n\nReflect is intended for the people/organization to look at what they did in the first step and seek out improvements. Retrospectives are one way of doing that, but there are many more. Regardless, if you don't honestly look at how to improve you work together, then step 1 will become more difficult over time.\n\nNow, HOW you accomplish steps 1 and 2 are going to depend wildly on your circumstances, or, dare I say it, *context*! The context for a small startup trying to establish a market for its web-based application is much different from that of an established telecom company writing phone switch software that handles 911 calls.\n\nAny \"canned\" process is going to have difficulty with this, even my beloved XP! For example, I was a strong believer in co-located teams until the COVID pandemic proved that in many cases we can be nearly as productive while remote (and with lower stress due to commuting). This is why I grew to love what Lean can teach us about observation and systems thinking on top of rote application of a process.\n\nSo, all that to answer that the only right way is to try something and reflect honestly on it. Did what your tried bring value? Did it improve morale? Did it improve lead & cycle times? Did it improve quality? Based on the answers to questions like those, adjust how you work then ask the questions again when you have new data.",

We run them only in production traffic and validate impact separately. In terms of tooling we use Optibase because we can control variants cleanly without touching app logic or test configs.

They will be able to navigate easily and make changes knowing defects will be trapped before release.  They will get to being productive quickly.  \n  \nBut - solo projects have a habit of increasing in complexity over time, with little-to-no documentation, and \"safety rails\" designed for that one person's skills and experience.  Expanding the team means you want a clone of yourself.  Upskilling becomes a slow and frustrating experience for you both, and they might bail.  \n  \nIn the latter case, it might pay to hire someone who can build out all of that stuff, so an experienced XP developer who can help you to shift to \"test first\" and \"red, green refactor\" while unpacking any technical debt and making the code clear.    \n  \nYou'll find an experienced dev more challenging (after flying solo on \"your baby\"), but you'll then be able to add juniors easily and upskill them fast.  \n  \nYMMV, but worked my way through the ball-of-mud problem, and a senior XP guy was gold. \n\n",

After 30 years of experience, mostly in startups and sometimes as a co-founder, I've learned that juniors can be *more* expensive than seniors.  There aren't enough seniors to mentor and guide them.  Tech debt gets out of control, even with PR reviews.\n\nIf possible, I would avoid having a team of fewer than 2 FTE developers.  It seems like you are stepping away into an architectural role.\n\nIt can be problematic to be too authoritarian over the long term.  You said you will do all PR reviews.  You should, for sure.  Just don't have a \"my way or the highway\" attitude.  Teams work best when it's flat; all members have equal say into the code's direction.  Of course you are the tie-breaker when debate wheel-spins.  If you can't let go, you aren't going to be a good leader and people will resent it.\n\nDon't **ever** hire a junior unless you have a spec-complete automated test suite and thorough linting, enforced in CI.   You should have those anyway.  Otherwise tech debt will be very hard to manage.\n\n---\n\nMy suggestion:\n\n* Hire 1 senior developer, while you are still be able to code most of the time.  When you code less than 20 hours a week, then hire a 2nd senior.\n* You ack as architect, but all developers' opinions are considered equal when it comes to changing coding standards and structure.  Pass all your new ideas to the team for discussion.\n* All code, including yours, must go through PR review approvals before being merged.  Enforce this in CI.\n* You must have automated tests and linters, enforced in CI.\n* You must have a ticketing system (even if's just trello or a google drive spreadsheet), and good use of version control.",
