I focused on understanding what the alerts actually meant and how to decide if something was normal activity or really suspicious.\nI did the 2 senarios simulator of TryHackMe. The exam felt very similar to the labs if you take the time to read the logs and follow the scenario step by step.\nIf you practice consistently and don’t rush your decisions, you’ll be fine. Took me 3 weeks 2 to 3 hours a day",

If you want a cert that’s more directly SOC-workflow-focused, CCDL1 on CyberDefenders is closer to what Tier 1 jobs interview on.",
