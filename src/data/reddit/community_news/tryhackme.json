It feels out of touch and made me question the validity or power of other certs thm offers.\n\n\nSal1 offers more soc scenarios than nonbusiness users, and both sal1 and pt1 supposed to show that you can take on an entry level job, but this 2 new cert doesnt do anything other than a completion badge(idk if its still a thing, you used to have one when you completed a module)\n\n\nSo thats my opinion on the matter, what do you think, how it is better than just doing the normal rooms and why would hiring manager would want somebody?",

The recommended learning doesn't even come close to the level you needed to pass this certificate.  \nWhile working towards the exam I noticed that the course Junior Pentest Path does not provide sufficient skills to tackle the room in the suggested learning. I noticed this discrepancy and began studying the HTB Penetration Tester Path, because people praise it for the quality and depth (and because I want to get CPTS as well). Now I feel confident tackling easy and medium boxes and have developed a feeling of what to expect in different situations. But this is in no way comparable to the amount of experience and insight you need to have to pass the exam.\n\nOf course this is not meant to be easy, but THM should have done a way better job of properly preparing for the challenge.\n\nI would love to hear what you think about this, from both people who passed, and people who didn't pass yet.\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts!\n\n",

          "text": "I recently passed SEC1, so I can't speak from experience when it comes to PT1.\n\nBut with SEC1 there is a similar kind of thing where the SC101 course (I did the old one they recently updated it) is a very guided experience vs. the exam. That's why I did a lot of easy boxes on my own before, with and without assistance, which was very humbling at the beginning. But in my point of view, this is by design, as it is a hands on challenge and not some multiple choice test that you can \"brute force\".\n\n So if you've only done the learning and not yet taken on many challenges on yourself without guided learning, it is way more tough. From what I saw of PT1 Path it actually seems so be less challenging than SC101 in some topics as they only show principles of attacks and you have to take that knowledge to the boxes to train it. So given the variety, you will have to do way more training for PT1 as most of it is recognizing patterns and how to exploit them.\n\nAlso: You're not supposed to answer all the questions perfectly or even all questions in total. It is a time and pressure based exam and if you're not already very competent it will be more than challenging.\n\nIf PT1 is based on the same scenario as SEC1 (\"you're a cyber security consultant\") then you don't have to know everything from memory. Real consultants and pentesters use Google and AI all the time to help themselves. It would be nuts to assume you're not allowed to Google shit, this is not some coding interview. And if you still can't pass it (which you will know only if you finish it) then you need more practice with boxes and getting experience. This is literally the reason to use THM, for training.\n\nBut if you don't know your stuff, you can't google it correctly or write the report. So it's more like open book exams. They don't explicitly say it in the T&C that you are allowed to google, only that you're supposed to answer the questions by yourself and given the scenario is hands on means having Google skills as well. Being good and looking up solutions is a very very useful skill in tech.\n\nGood luck for the rest of the exam!",

Even to make it seem harder. Good lessons though for beginners. I’ve learned quite a bit. I wish there was more to keep us more involved in the tools or even a direct lesson for Bloodhound and ligolo-ng",

Then I focus and learn on network and Active Directory. I practice it day by day during my free time, then taking notes. Taking notes were important specially on the times that it seems familiar, you can go back and see how it was done. Also, reading write ups after you pawned the room was a good thing to do (just for me), you can see a different path they make and you can learn from other people also.\n\nNow I want to take HTB certification, but I wish I can back my motivation that I get before taking the PT1. I missed the daily learning grind. \n\nYou can do it man, failing is disappointing like crushing your soul I felt that after that. But I take that failure to motivation I see myself improving from zero knowledge on network to AD to pawning it on exam. ",

      "text": "Today I attempted the SAL1 exam. After daily intensive preparation (3 months of Cisco and 5 months of TryHackMe paths and rooms), I thought I was ready for everything. I also practiced a lot with ChatGPT (not sure how useful that actually is, since it often hallucinates and just tells you what you want to hear).\n\nDespite all this, I failed with a score of 631. It’s hard to understand what exactly went wrong, because TryHackMe does not provide proper feedback - only a generic, auto-generated response.\n\nSo I have a few questions, and maybe someone here can give me some advice.\n\nQuestion 1\n\nI described the entire attack chain in only one report. For example, alert #1000 contained the full report for the whole chain, while alerts #1001 and #1002 only had a note like:\n\n“Reviewed and identified as part of a larger incident documented under alert ID 1000.”\n\nIs this the correct approach specifically for passing SAL1? I ask because I received very few points for reports, even though they were quite accurate (5W, IoCs, remediation). Maybe I was supposed to copy the full report from #1000 and paste it into #1001 and #1002 as well?\n\nQuestion 2\n\nThe exam description mentions that extra points are given for MITRE, but obviously no SOC L1 analyst knows all tactic and technique IDs by heart. This raises a question:\n\nAm I allowed to use internet search during the exam to look up MITRE tactics, or would that be considered cheating?\n\nPersonally, during my attempt I only had one tab open with the exam itself and didn’t even use pre-prepared report templates from text documents, because ChatGPT told me this was forbidden - although I couldn’t actually find such a rule in the exam guidelines.\n\nFinal thought\n\nThis is not really a question, but in my opinion the scoring system feels very harsh. You misclassify just 3 alerts and you fail. What do you think about that? Also, the time is very limited - I barely managed to finish the first simulation.\n\nIf you have any advice on how to improve the score specifically for the practical task, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks to everyone who responds.",

As I was planning on taking the eJPT before either found out about the PT1 I was focused on taking the eJPT. Now I do have experience documenting my tests, but I do not know if I have the right experience for the actual test since I have read that the PT1 is harder then the eJPT. So overall my question is does anyone know any boxes I can work on to see if my skill set is ready to take on the PT1 exam? Thank you in advance. ",

I only made them out of boredom. I recommend them for those who (as is my case) have never taken a professional certification exam and want to see what the methodology is like. Beyond that, I don’t think it’s advisable to pay for these certifications at this time. Likewise, the roads are amazing, except for the new section of OWASP that is poorly exploited. I made the road in August 2025. T for those who have doubts about whether they should “memorize” the contents. No, in cybersecurity it is uncommon to memorize commands, rather processes and critical thinking are fundamental.",

I joined as an intern at ₹10k stipend for 6 months because I had no other option and didn’t want to sit idle for another year.\n\nI had to build and manage everything on my own — Entra ID, Zoho Endpoint, FortiGate firewall, user onboarding/offboarding, machine handover process, software issues, vendor coordination, troubleshooting, all of it. No senior, no guidance. I learned everything by myself while handling live issues.\n\nAfter internship they offered ₹13,500 in-hand. I pushed back. After a month they revised it to ₹16,500. I live in Pune as a bachelor and honestly it feels low for the responsibility I’m handling. I don’t think management fully understands the scope of my work.\n\nI also have basic Linux knowledge and CCNA-level networking skills. It’s been almost a year here.\n\nI’m confused:\n\nShould I continue here for experience?\n\nSwitch to a better IT support/sysadmin role?\n\nOr start moving toward cybersecurity now?\n\n\nMain concern is financial stability. I don’t want to burden my family again.\n\nWould really appreciate practical advice from people who’ve been in similar situations.\n\n",

I would use keyword searches on multiple job sites. \n\nSo I would search for Cisco Packet Tracer on job sites, do any SOC roles come up? However the way to think about this is Cisco Packet Tracer is a learning tool. Would any employer really ask for knowledge on Cisco Packet Tracer if you're not teaching others? Probably not. \n\nSo lets say you get results or don't get results for Cisco Packet Tracer, what do you do next? You use key word searches again, so you search for SOC and Security Operations Center Analyst. Essentially you find SOC Roles on the job sites and then read the job description and note down all the common skills they want. If you see any products Splunk, Defender XDR, Certification names note them down and then use them as keyword searches. \n\nI can go on with examples but this is how you research the local job market. See what roles come up, see what employers are asking for in terms of common fundamental skills and certifications. Then work on gaining those fundamental skills and make sure you research that the certifications are beginner friendly because you don't want to waste time on advanced certifications you can't back up with working experience.

But to be honest, it’s really good that did that as by doing this, the person can learn everything needed right from the same platform and really from zero knowledge, rather like before it was expected for the person to know the material from somewhere else. By this they want even more engagement with their platform and a closed circle.",
