I find it endlessly fascinating to take all of these tiny pieces of information and try to reconstruct the who, what, where, when & how of an attack. If I could spend all day digging through pcaps solving mysteries, that would be awesome. But it helps to learn how to pull off something like an ARP spoofing attack or how to send C2 commands over DNS to know how to spot them in a packet capture, which is why I still do red team learning as well.\n\nSo I guess if you're doing a room or CTF and find yourself thinking how cool it is or how much fun you're having, start there, figure out how that thing you like is attacked/defended, then learn about dealing with those attacks/defenses. It kinda builds a path for you based on an activity you know you enjoy. This is how it clicks together for me, but it may not be the same for you.",

Luckily I started learning those 2 - 3 years ago at home and my home lab is hybrid AD now. \n\nThe smaller enclaves that are still AD, aka 'on prem', though. Good Lord, I have realized recently just how behind some \\[most?\\] of our folks are. They don't even know what a GPO is, let alone how to create, link, and edit one. They don't have a handle on PowerShell at all, let alone how to use it to query log files. Speaking of log files, I have had to explain very slowly that you need a WEC to consolidate all your DC's logs in one place. \n\nI was training one of our newer cyber guys on how to setup a WEC today, how to configure a GPO so said WEC can pull the DC's logs, what SDDL is, why SDDL even matters in 2026, when you might see SDDL again, etc. None of the other guys were paying any attention. \n\n**TL;DR** JMHO but this \"vendor specific\" stuff matters, a LOT. Theory is great to get the basics down, CompTIA is good at that stage, but eventually you have to get down in the proverbial weeds regarding the specific tech your org uses. You have to understand how it works, how to configure it, how to audit for \\[mis\\]configs, etc. Otherwise how in heaven or hell are you going to know how to secure it!? \n\n**Summary** so AD Security, or Windows Security more broadly, interests me. It's what gets me hot and bothered about the difference between DACLs & SACLs, how to query and set both, how little \\[mis\\]configs can daisy chain and create an escalation path, etc etc\n\n**The Point** when you find 'The One' you'll know. It'll be what keeps you up late at night, what makes you lose track of time, what keeps you banging away in the CLI, what crowds out all other topics when it comes to your Google search history/ChatGTP/Gemini/etc.",

I had to grab them off the dark web before the dark web was a term.\n\nMicrosoft is a much, much better company now. They give away free trial copies of all their stuff now. Hyper-V exists, is free, and is worlds ahead of what we had back then. PowerShell came out around 2006 too, before that Microsoft was kinda a joke as legacy cmd.exe was just not good and to script things back then you were using \\*.cmd, \\*.bat, or Visual Basic Scripts (\\*.vbs). Nowadays attackers use that legacy crap because it still runs and some Blue Team tools and folks don't think to filter for that stuff.\n\nBack then I was more confident, if anything, because I simply didn't realize how much I didn't know. Later on I learned. It just takes time, you'll get there. Everyone starts somewhere.\n\nThe best thing you can do is screw around at home with what your work uses or what you want to work on. I learned more from doing that than anything outside of on the job experience. The two re-enforce each other too. The home lab doesn't have users and the issues they come with, but you can screw around, wing it, try things out just because ... and no one is telling you no, telling you to get a change request approved first, or asking when the network will be back up.",
