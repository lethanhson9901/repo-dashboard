I focused on understanding what the alerts actually meant and how to decide if something was normal activity or really suspicious.\nI did the 2 senarios simulator of TryHackMe. The exam felt very similar to the labs if you take the time to read the logs and follow the scenario step by step.\nIf you practice consistently and don’t rush your decisions, you’ll be fine.

It tells me that I wrote something (even though I didn't), and it's just random commands not even related to the room I am working on. I feel like when I need help with something from the room, it's better to just use any free language model, which gives me a better answer than Echo.\n\nThe VPN issues were very noticeable during the AOC 2025. It was so bad that I, along with many users on Discord, had to use your AttackBox just to complete some rooms. With the VPN, we couldn't even load a website or connect to mail servers, and the speed was extremely slow. I understand that you want to promote your AttackBox to encourage users to upgrade their plans, but I find it much better to use my own environment. Not everyone prefer using AttackBox.\n\nPlease also pass on the complaint regarding the student plan. Otherwise, it feels as though you prioritize money over the needs of the students 🙂🙏",

The material on the site is fantastic, but when there is *so much material* it is easy to forget about something you may have learned about 4 or 5 sections ago. Having a way to practice concepts would surely help people deepen their familiarity with a concept over the passage of time, especially someone like myself who is not in any sort of cyber role, but is trying to build up foundational knowledge to make a career switch ASAP.\n\nThanks for all of the info on the site so far, though!

It would be great to incorporate that device into rooms.\n\nObviously you'd start off with your basic tutorial and work your way up to using the device to help you solve rooms. And while I know that not everyone has many of these devices, I still think THM would be a good platform to show you how to use them responsibly in semi real world scenarios. \n\nSo far I think I've only encountered one or two rooms that just presupposes there was a usb drop (think it was the Windcorp? series) and we go along from there. In that scenario we could actually use ducky script or even the newer zerotrace to write our own scripts to use and have the mobile app confirm submissions. \n\nI love linux but I see it as extremely limiting to only use terminals to teach pen testing when every day more and more devices are being released.

But I have learned so much from day 1 up until now, I wouldn't really have been the most confident in the terminal or with Linux, now I have no problem opening the terminal and using Linux. I would say i have good approach to getting access to a server, and web application hacking. On the point of web application hacking,  I have learned a lot more about it too. \n\nI would also say take notes, it will help cause you can't remember everything.

I have found when I don't have a startegy of recognizing patterns and tools for certain scenarios then it makes no difference what I \"learned\" or don't know on an \"easy\" box. I've just started with a way to find the things you listed for the way I learn and work. Awesome to see someone else thinking the same.\n\nI also find it challenging that after you complete a training there is no easy list of similar rooms or related challenges. I've wasted more time trying to make a list of similar training concepts and challenges so I can learn something then go right to a challenge to test skills and mindset. Are you keeping a list of which challenge rooms follow certain concepts or go with training rooms? (Hopefully that makes sense)\n\nCheers",

          "text": "If you aren't writing notes, I would highly recommend that you start. Good notes are:  \n\\#1: Not too long but not too short  \n\\#2: Organized in a way you can quickly find the stuff you need  \n\\#3. Useable for the future  \n\\#4: Based on the techniques, tactics, procedures, and tools you learned\n\nThis also means that when writing a note, you shouldn't name it by the room you are doing. You won't remember which room taught you specifically what you are trying to find.\n\nObsidian is a great app to use for writing notes. It is completely free (except for linking your notes between different devices, which isn't necessary), and it is what I personally use.\n\nI would recommend trying out challenge boxes in TryHackMe and seeing how you are doing. If you can solve them, well, it seems like you are learning! If you can't solve them, look at the walkthroughs. If the walkthroughs show something you didn't learn, then it isn't your fault. You just have to keep learning. If the walkthroughs do show something you learned but you couldn't find, think about why you couldn't find it, and maybe go back to learning content that teaches it.\n\nHope this helps :)",

In order to actually prepare, you need to do dozens of different boxes to get a feel for CTF's and how to look for vulnerabilities etc. Th style of training included is unacceptable, especially when the point of many budget certs is that the included training is comprehensive. The general learning paths on their own are good, but there are aspects of the exam not covered in training at all. Very big aspects imo like API hacking.",

There seems to be a reduction in need of dashboard analysts. To most cyber students and learners, these skills and ideas are not really understood or taught well. Even though mature SOCs mention threat detection engineering as one of the most important skills for the future of SOCs. Many smaller organization cannot afford dedicated detection engineers, and rely on employees who are jack of all trades. By having not just a module, but including it in learning paths like say like a SOC 2 these skills can be taught to thousands of learners. For me personally, I work as a cloud engineer and I know the value in X as code solutions. Same reason why infrastructure, pipeline, configuration, and other as code solutions exist. It makes version control, automated scanning, and even disaster recovery easier among other numerous benefits which I am sure you know. Engineering type skills in general are going to be massively valuable in the future in my opinion.\n\nEdit:\nI understand teaching detection engineering is hard, essentially you already need to have good threat hunting skills. But I feel as if there is a hole in the market for detection training.",

Good OSINT often decides how effective the rest of an engagement will be.\nA structured learning path would be really valuable because OSINT is very fragmented at the moment. There are countless tools and techniques, but little guidance on when to use what, how to validate findings, and how to stay within legal and ethical boundaries.\nA TryHackMe OSINT path could teach not only how to collect information, but how to think like a red teamer during reconnaissance. Building hypotheses, confirming or disproving them, avoiding false positives, and turning raw data into actionable intelligence.\nFor me, OSINT is especially useful for early-stage recon, attack surface mapping, target profiling, and identifying weak points before any active interaction happens. A certification would also help demonstrate that these skills are applied in a structured and responsible way, not just tool usage.",

I’d be far more likely to sit the real thing if I knew what to expect. A small fee or a limited number of attempts per timeframe would be completely reasonable.\n* **Challenge point realignment** I feel challenges should be worth more points, with walkthroughs earning fewer. Challenges are significantly harder than walkthroughs, yet I have been able to reach a sub-1500 rank mostly by completing walkthroughs, which feels misaligned with the effort and knowledge required.\n* **More transparency around room stability** I stopped doing challenges for a period because rooms were frequently crashing. Some visibility into what has been done, or is being done, to improve platform stability would go a long way in restoring confidence.\n* **Weekly league improvements** Joining a league early puts you at a disadvantage. It would feel fairer if users were randomly assigned to groups at the start of each week instead. Also be cool if it kept track of how long you have been in X league.\n* **Rethinking streaks** Streaks have lost some meaning since they’re relatively easy to build up now. I understand support often has to restore streaks due to issues outside users’ control, which likely contributes to this. A compromise could be a few streaks and allowing one “pause” per month, useful for things like travel or camping where access just isn’t possible.\n* **In-room reporting and health status** The ability to flag a broken room directly from the room itself would be great. This could feed into a visible “health” indicator for rooms. While there will be false positives, reports could be weighted by user rank or experience. Possibly could use people finishing to as well to give an indication of health . As you might have picked up, I've spent days and days on rooms that ended up been broken. \n* **Taking known-broken rooms offline** It’s frustrating to discover a room is broken only after reporting it to support and being told it’s already a known issue. Temporarily taking such rooms offline would save learners a lot of time and frustration.\n* **Adopting a KCS (Knowledge-Centered Service) approach** A KCS-style knowledge base could reduce support load while also helping users self-serve known issues and workarounds more effectively. Ideally throwing AI at support data and building out articles, with vetting of course. (Coming from experience it is really effective at case deflection)\n\nOverall, I really enjoy the platform and want to see it continue to improve. These are all suggestions coming from a place of wanting TryHackMe to be even better for learners at every stage of their journey. Yes, had ChatGPT fix my poor grammar and spelling. \n\nLastly thank you, kinda upset some skill sets I've learnt over a very long time can be quickly learnt on a platform like THM",

SOC L1 you can take 1-2 pre made mock tests to see if you're actually ready or what to reinforce more\n\nAlso, picking your own VPN servers was a nice way to fix some issues, so bringing it back is a good idea\n\n>Content recommendations\n\nI'd gladly see a rework of Pentesting/Red Teaming path - similar to what has happened to SOC L1, with more content strictly for PT1 or other certs (like OSCP)\n\nApart from that, refreshing or introducing new networks or just AD machines overall would be fun to see. There's a lot of linux-based CTFs and I sometimes feel there's a lack of windows machines. Alongside that, a bit bigger Compromising Active Directory module that'd cover ex. exploting AD with ESC\\[X\\] misconfigurations and other more modern/advanced techniques would be interesting to see\n\nAnd for new content/learning path - A Malware analyst path which would include  \n\\- Basic C and x86 Assembly - and recognizing C constructs in assembly  \n\\- Basic computer internals (a.ka how memory works, what are CPU registers)  \n\\- Using common deassemblers (like ghidra, IDA, objdump)  \n\\- ELF and PE files - their structures, what to look for etc.  \n\\- Something on shellcode, packers and deobfuscation  \n\\- Common malware techniques, presented from both malware author and analyst sides  \n\\- Dynamic analysis tools and how to use them  \n\\- A capstone challenge that'd include a malicious sample and then reconstructing whole infection chain - a.ka learner has to understand how sample works and detect what has been changed\n\nThere's a bit of content on that, but I feel like this topic is so big, that it deserves its own path  \n\n\n>Small quality of life changes\n\nDark mode that adapts based off user's desktop motive, eliminating rooms that require a cloud add-on from results when picking \"Free-only\" and maybe more stable windows machines\n\n>Wild and whacky ideas\n\nCleaner point-earning system lol",

When I'm connected to the VPN, websites often don't load at all or load very slowly, and now we're no longer able to pick a VPN server there's really nothing to be done when that happens. You can set up rules within the VPN client to circumvent this somewhat but it really shouldn't be necessary.\n\n\n\nAs a whole allowing users to use their own tools rather than the attackbox would be a smart move that also insentivizes users to set up their own persistent VM which you're going to want to do at some point if you're serious about learning anyway. It would relieve some of the pressure on THM's infrastructure, and having the choice to use your own setup by, say, downloading files needed for tasks, or providing SSH/RDP logins as a default is                always a good thing.\n\n\n\nOh also, fixing the accessibility issues rampant within rooms that I've pointed out since 2021 would be great. Something something European Accessibility Act, something something lawsuits.",

Every module goes straight through and shows you how to do something once (and the writing differs, so some are more instructional than others) but that’s it. Having more than one example per module would allow them to reinforce that particular skill within the module before moving on, giving the user more confidence in their understanding instead of just “well, I finished that one so I’ll move to the next one”. It’s probably the reason there are so many “answer” pages online: the “lessons” only show so much. (Before anybody “@ me”, I understand responsibility needs to be taken on the user’s part as well, but most people learn items via repetition as opposed to one-and-done from one example). \n\nThen again: what do I know?  I’m just one user.",

When I first started in this field back in October, I felt optimistic and felt like I was making good progress. During the first modules, which are the foundation of everything, I felt like I was on the right track and succeeding.\n\nNow that I’ve reached the Metasploit section (which is one of the most essential tools) I feel stuck. I'm starting to doubt if I’m even good at this because I have to rely on YouTube videos and Gemini to make sure the information actually clicks and that I'm actually learning something. My progress is slow, and as I move forward and read through the topics, things just aren't feeling clear to me.\n\nMaybe I just wanted to vent and get some support from this community, since I don't have any friends who are doing the same thing. This is turning into a very lonely learning journey.\n\nHave a great day.",

Nobody masters maths after a few lessons, and the same goes for cyber security. \n\nIt is actually perfectly good to use youtube to help and see different perspectives, and as much as I hate using AI, it is a great tool to ASSIST, in fact it is perfectly good self study etiquette to gather information from different sources.

I want to learn cybersecurity and hacking in a way where I am not just doing plug and play stuff, I want to learn all of the deep theory\n\nOne one side, I am thinking I should get another degree, or at least buy and study all of the textbooks that the degree's curriculum says to\n\nAnd on the other side I am thinking of doing something online at first and then seeing how things go\n\nHow close to a Cyber Security degree is tryhackme and what should I do if I'm a CS major and already understand Computer Science and programming\n\nThank you!",

I’m really interested in following the **Pre-Security** and **Introduction to Cybersecurity** paths, but I noticed a lot of the later modules are locked behind the Premium subscription.\n\nFor those who have paid for it:\n\n* Did you find the Premium-only learning paths (like SOC Level 1 or Jr. Pentester) actually helped you learn better than the free content?\n* Do the certificates of completion carry any weight when you're just starting out?\n\nI'm a student, so I'm trying to be careful with my budget. Would love to hear if you felt it was a solid investment or if I should wait for a sale. Thanks!",

It's a bit gamified sure, but I feel like starting from 0 this would have taught me more practical knowledge than any of my degrees ever did, which were almost not hands on at all. Despite people saying \"dur hurr THM won't get you a job\" I bet you'll be able to better talk the talk in an entry level interview, hopefully combined with your related studies in school, than you would otherwise. Also you should aggressively pursue internships to supplement your degree and THM training.\n\nTLDR: Yes, I'd grab premium.",

I would argue a good compromise are CISCO Netacad and any cloud provider certs",
