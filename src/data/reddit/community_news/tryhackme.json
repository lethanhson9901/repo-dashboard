Their certifications are too new to have any reputation.\n4. Every THM exam I've taken has been riddled with technical issues, some preventing the exam from being completed and requiring it to be rescheduled. \n5. Unclear renewal process (seems like you have to retake the exam itself every 3 years?)",

          "text": "Biggest issue I see so far with THM certs, is that THM doesn't do anything to legitimize them. On one hand, giving away thousands of vouchers is a great way to build community sentiment. On the other, it almost immediately de legitimizes the value as a credential. If everyone is PT1 or SAL1 certified, it means nothing as a differentiator.\n\nThe bigger issue on legitimacy, comes from the rampant cheating that can be easily done on their certs. I have seen people share PT1 flags openly in various discord servers. The AI report grading feature is not rigorous enough to actually cut out low effort/low quality reports. The report feels more like hitting all the correct key words rather than creating an actual report, or testing the students own writing ability. I understand the choice of no proctoring keeps cost low, but TCM and HTB also forgo proctoring and manage to keep the integrity of their exams in tact. Thus making it valuable as a credential. As it stands now, THM certs are worth 0 in my honest opinion.\n\nIt is such a shame, because there is a lot to like about the courses and exams themselves. But with how easy it is to game and cheat the exams and courses, you cannot recommend them as real credentials. Cheating is everywhere right, with THM certs its in the open almost.",

For tryhackme they will referencing it to security engineer path because it has module for it. So if you want to get hired my opinion was to get experience, prove your skill, continuous learning then get certified. We know OSCP was bit expensive but the company sometimes provided it but limited, but if you have money for it go for it because it was the most recognizable alongside with CEH, CISSP.",

By doing so, you would notice you wrote “drib” instead of dirb, and even if that wouldn’t make sense to you, you could then compare your input against the command suggested in that module. This would be the right approach in that particular case. I think creating a post for this, considering it is a guided assignment, is too much. Please go through the lessons more carefully and rather apply the little methodology I have written above rather than immediately relying on Reddit. \nTerminal output will almost always guide clearly where you have gone wrong with your command.
