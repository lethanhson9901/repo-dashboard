Which factor is most likely causing the issue?”* there are **many valid answers** that could fit. Because the input expects an exact phrase, the correct answer really needs to be explicitly stated in the content so it can be copied and pasted. Otherwise, users are left guessing the precise wording, which is frustrating and time-consuming. This actually discouraged me from continuing.\n* Also, be consistent with terminology. For example, the content uses **“Wi-Fi”**, but the answer field expects **“WiFi”**. Small inconsistencies like this can cause unnecessary confusion.",

In most cases, they require some time and experience in general IT before you can realistically break into a junior security role.\n\nThe best approach is usually to start in IT, build a solid foundation, and then transition into cybersecurity from there.\n\nSo try hack me for fun and elevating skills, basic certs like comp tia to break into general IT unless you have a secondary education like computer science.",

IT and cyber have a high turnover rate, so you can test it out to see if you like it and are passionate about it.\n\nIf you are, all the best to you, I'm 31 and just started an internship in cybersecurity company and I love it.I do have previous work Exp with some good companies and a degree in IT with certifications such as sec +, CEH, and 2 cybersecurity Bootcamps.\n\nI",
