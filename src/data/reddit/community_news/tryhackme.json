After more than one month of hard work, I have created this space. Please go and join it.\n\nI would really appreciate it if you could point out any mistakes, so that I can improve myself and gain more knowledge.\n\n[https://tryhackme.com/jr/fullnetworkingnoneedanythingafterit](https://tryhackme.com/jr/fullnetworkingnoneedanythingafterit)",

Which factor is most likely causing the issue?”* there are **many valid answers** that could fit. Because the input expects an exact phrase, the correct answer really needs to be explicitly stated in the content so it can be copied and pasted. Otherwise, users are left guessing the precise wording, which is frustrating and time-consuming. This actually discouraged me from continuing.\n* Also, be consistent with terminology. For example, the content uses **“Wi-Fi”**, but the answer field expects **“WiFi”**. Small inconsistencies like this can cause unnecessary confusion.",

Posteriormente continué con el Cibersecurity 101 y aunque pensé que me gustaría irme de lleno como Pentester, estoy disfrutando mucho SOC. Cada quien halla su nicho y camino, pero explora los fundamentos y de allí usa y trabaja con Terminales. Usualmente hago una lección completa diaria, pero hay temas que disfruto más que otros o que reviso en más sitios para ampliar el conocimiento. Consejo no solicitado: Al ir aprendiendo a usar más los sistemas operativos, te darás cuenta de que aunque parezca un chiste, hay que dominar Microsoft porque será muy común encontrar problemas en empresas que te contraten allí.",

Most junior pentest roles still expect solid fundamentals, labs, and often prior experience, even if the title says “junior.”\n\nSOC roles often have fresher positions because companies need people to monitor alerts, investigate logs, and learn on the job. It’s also a great way to build real-world security experience that can later transition into pentesting if you still want that.\n\nMy advice: start with SOC, build strong fundamentals (networking, Windows/Linux, logs, SIEM, incident triage), and get hands-on practice. Platforms that focus on investigation-style labs (like CCDL1 or CyberDefenders labs) help you think like an analyst, not just pass exams.\n\nOnce you’ve got real exposure and can explain how you handled alerts or incidents, moving toward pentesting becomes much easier.",
