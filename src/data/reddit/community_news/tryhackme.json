You download some tools, use those tools, find exploits. Cool your a hacker. Then there is this other guy, he built his first PC when he was like 10 or 11, he taught himself to build web pages and servers, did a little scitpting, he plays with different languages and protocols, builds some programs others find useful, he knows the inner workings of a router and a switch, how the break down data and send it out. Ends up getting A+ and Net+ on his first go because its second nature didnt even study for it. Now he is the guy coding those programs the other hackers use to find exploits. \n\nIn short, to be good in the cyber space you need to know it all. From how to make an ethernet cable, to what services uses what port. If you skip through information you are limiting yourself. By all defention, bill gates, mark Zuckerberg, Steve jobs were all hackers. You need a firm grasp of programming languages, operating systems, networking to be good at it.",

I am not sure where to start as most videos I see on YouTube are for people that have no IT background or are barely starting to get into cyber security.\n\nI currently do not have any certifications since they always slipped my mind while I focused on getting as much hands on experience as I can. Everyone keep saying for me to start with Security+ but I am not sure if it is worth it for me as it seems to be an entry level point to get your first job in cybersecurity. I have also heard it good to get CCNA or Network+ certificates and those may align where I am in my career. I also know that I should learn more Linux as I only know the basics of it and should also learn Python as it seems to be a core programming language for automation and other things.\n\nShould I still get Security+, CCNA/Network+ or just go straight into a pen testing cert or other ethical hacking cert and just get more caught up with Linux and Python?\n\n  \n",

Or am I too \"new\" in cyber security?\n\nI know I currently know close to nothing outside basic command lines, but I do intend on studying every day.\n\nWhat does those event typically look like?\nCan we still learn while we are there? Or is it more for people who already have a good base?",

Shadows of Transylvania has difficulty levels from Easy to Insane, so you won't be thrown into the deep end without options.\n\nAt your stage, the Easy challenges are genuinely doable with basic command line knowledge and a willingness to search and learn as you go. Most people learn more in 48 hours of a CTF than in weeks of passive study because you're solving real problems, not just watching tutorials.\n\nTryHackMe is actually great prep. Keep going.\n\nThe honest answer: you won't solve everything, and that's completely fine. The goal at your level is to finish a few challenges, understand how the process works, and meet people who are a few steps ahead of you.",
