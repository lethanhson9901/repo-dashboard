Which factor is most likely causing the issue?”* there are **many valid answers** that could fit. Because the input expects an exact phrase, the correct answer really needs to be explicitly stated in the content so it can be copied and pasted. Otherwise, users are left guessing the precise wording, which is frustrating and time-consuming. This actually discouraged me from continuing.\n* Also, be consistent with terminology. For example, the content uses **“Wi-Fi”**, but the answer field expects **“WiFi”**. Small inconsistencies like this can cause unnecessary confusion.",

I have a premium account so that means I can do almost any room (as-long as my skills allow me to of course). \n\nIs there anything I should learn along side the stuff I’ll be learning on TryHackMe. \n\nThanks in advance.

So far, I'm still working on the AD basic enumeration and authenticated enumeration. But I'm done with the training paths from pre-security to Web Fundamentals.\n\n  \nAny tips that I can prepare? Thanks!",

I would say that if you don't feel confident yet, try to do as many challenges that are relevant. \n\nYou will feel stuck every now and then, but its about getting comfortable to not being comfortable and overcoming that initial friction you get when doing unguided work. Also, write down what you are doing and why you are doing it and document it. This will come in handy with the post-exploit/pentest report.\n\nPractice and be curious! \n\nGL",
