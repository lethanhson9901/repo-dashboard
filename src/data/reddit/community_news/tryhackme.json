I focused on understanding what the alerts actually meant and how to decide if something was normal activity or really suspicious.\nI did the 2 senarios simulator of TryHackMe. The exam felt very similar to the labs if you take the time to read the logs and follow the scenario step by step.\nIf you practice consistently and don’t rush your decisions, you’ll be fine.

If you want a cert that’s more directly SOC-workflow-focused, CCDL1 on CyberDefenders is closer to what Tier 1 jobs interview on.",

And if you get stuck on a challenge, stop and come back to it with fresh head cause it can be very overwhelming sometimes. Dont be afraid to ask someone for help or even look up a walkthrough, even if it's just to get pass that part. \n\nI come from a backend developer background so that kinda helped me with some stuff. But I have learned so much from day 1 up until now, I wouldn't really have been the most confident in the terminal or with Linux, now I have no problem opening the terminal and using Linux. I would say i have good approach to getting access to a server, and web application hacking. On the point of web application hacking,  I have learned a lot more about it too. \n\nI would also say take notes, it will help cause you can't remember everything. And dont be afraid to ask people for hints cause we have all been there.\n\nBest of luck in the journey",

Good notes are:  \n\\#1: Not too long but not too short  \n\\#2: Organized in a way you can quickly find the stuff you need  \n\\#3. Useable for the future  \n\\#4: Based on the techniques, tactics, procedures, and tools you learned\n\nThis also means that when writing a note, you shouldn't name it by the room you are doing. You won't remember which room taught you specifically what you are trying to find.\n\nObsidian is a great app to use for writing notes. It is completely free (except for linking your notes between different devices, which isn't necessary), and it is what I personally use.\n\nI would recommend trying out challenge boxes in TryHackMe and seeing how you are doing. If you can solve them, well, it seems like you are learning! If you can't solve them, look at the walkthroughs. If the walkthroughs show something you didn't learn, then it isn't your fault. You just have to keep learning. If the walkthroughs do show something you learned but you couldn't find, think about why you couldn't find it, and maybe go back to learning content that teaches it.\n\nHope this helps :)",

          "text": "As someone who’s spent a lot of time learning on TryHackMe, here are a few ideas that I think could meaningfully improve the platform and learner experience:\n\n* **A clearer Windows learning path** Even if it’s built by stitching together existing rooms, having a dedicated and coherent Windows-focused path would be hugely valuable.\n* **Note taking rooms** An introductory room early in the journey focused on the importance of note-taking, with guidance on best practices and suggested approaches to help learners retain and revisit knowledge. including topics like tools to note take on, organization, building check lists etc  \n* **Certificate-style practice exams** A practice exam that closely emulates the real certification experience would lower the barrier to attempting the actual exam. I’d be far more likely to sit the real thing if I knew what to expect. A small fee or a limited number of attempts per timeframe would be completely reasonable.\n* **Challenge point realignment** I feel challenges should be worth more points, with walkthroughs earning fewer. Challenges are significantly harder than walkthroughs, yet I have been able to reach a sub-1500 rank mostly by completing walkthroughs, which feels misaligned with the effort and knowledge required.\n* **More transparency around room stability** I stopped doing challenges for a period because rooms were frequently crashing. Some visibility into what has been done, or is being done, to improve platform stability would go a long way in restoring confidence.\n* **Weekly league improvements** Joining a league early puts you at a disadvantage. It would feel fairer if users were randomly assigned to groups at the start of each week instead. Also be cool if it kept track of how long you have been in X league.\n* **Rethinking streaks** Streaks have lost some meaning since they’re relatively easy to build up now. I understand support often has to restore streaks due to issues outside users’ control, which likely contributes to this. A compromise could be a few streaks and allowing one “pause” per month, useful for things like travel or camping where access just isn’t possible.\n* **In-room reporting and health status** The ability to flag a broken room directly from the room itself would be great. This could feed into a visible “health” indicator for rooms. While there will be false positives, reports could be weighted by user rank or experience. Possibly could use people finishing to as well to give an indication of health . As you might have picked up, I've spent days and days on rooms that ended up been broken. \n* **Taking known-broken rooms offline** It’s frustrating to discover a room is broken only after reporting it to support and being told it’s already a known issue. Temporarily taking such rooms offline would save learners a lot of time and frustration.\n* **Adopting a KCS (Knowledge-Centered Service) approach** A KCS-style knowledge base could reduce support load while also helping users self-serve known issues and workarounds more effectively. Ideally throwing AI at support data and building out articles, with vetting of course. (Coming from experience it is really effective at case deflection)\n\nOverall, I really enjoy the platform and want to see it continue to improve. These are all suggestions coming from a place of wanting TryHackMe to be even better for learners at every stage of their journey. Yes, had ChatGPT fix my poor grammar and spelling. \n\nLastly thank you, kinda upset some skill sets I've learnt over a very long time can be quickly learnt on a platform like THM",

When I'm connected to the VPN, websites often don't load at all or load very slowly, and now we're no longer able to pick a VPN server there's really nothing to be done when that happens. You can set up rules within the VPN client to circumvent this somewhat but it really shouldn't be necessary.\n\n\n\nAs a whole allowing users to use their own tools rather than the attackbox would be a smart move that also insentivizes users to set up their own persistent VM which you're going to want to do at some point if you're serious about learning anyway. It would relieve some of the pressure on THM's infrastructure, and having the choice to use your own setup by, say, downloading files needed for tasks, or providing SSH/RDP logins as a default is                always a good thing.\n\n\n\nOh also, fixing the accessibility issues rampant within rooms that I've pointed out since 2021 would be great.

Every module goes straight through and shows you how to do something once (and the writing differs, so some are more instructional than others) but that’s it. Having more than one example per module would allow them to reinforce that particular skill within the module before moving on, giving the user more confidence in their understanding instead of just “well, I finished that one so I’ll move to the next one”. It’s probably the reason there are so many “answer” pages online: the “lessons” only show so much. (Before anybody “@ me”, I understand responsibility needs to be taken on the user’s part as well, but most people learn items via repetition as opposed to one-and-done from one example). \n\nThen again: what do I know?

Everything else in the prerequisites can be learned on either THM or Pwncollege Fundamentals (White Belt stuff).",
