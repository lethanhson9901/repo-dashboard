          "text": "I mean, the terminal itself pointed that likely the command you issued was incorrect, so the next normal approach in that case would be to look carefully at each word you have typed as input to the terminal. By doing so, you would notice you wrote “drib” instead of dirb, and even if that wouldn’t make sense to you, you could then compare your input against the command suggested in that module. This would be the right approach in that particular case. I think creating a post for this, considering it is a guided assignment, is too much. Please go through the lessons more carefully and rather apply the little methodology I have written above rather than immediately relying on Reddit. \nTerminal output will almost always guide clearly where you have gone wrong with your command. Hope it helps.",
