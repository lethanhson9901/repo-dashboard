Which factor is most likely causing the issue?”* there are **many valid answers** that could fit. Because the input expects an exact phrase, the correct answer really needs to be explicitly stated in the content so it can be copied and pasted. Otherwise, users are left guessing the precise wording, which is frustrating and time-consuming. This actually discouraged me from continuing.\n* Also, be consistent with terminology. For example, the content uses **“Wi-Fi”**, but the answer field expects **“WiFi”**. Small inconsistencies like this can cause unnecessary confusion.",

I find it endlessly fascinating to take all of these tiny pieces of information and try to reconstruct the who, what, where, when & how of an attack. If I could spend all day digging through pcaps solving mysteries, that would be awesome. But it helps to learn how to pull off something like an ARP spoofing attack or how to send C2 commands over DNS to know how to spot them in a packet capture, which is why I still do red team learning as well.\n\nSo I guess if you're doing a room or CTF and find yourself thinking how cool it is or how much fun you're having, start there, figure out how that thing you like is attacked/defended, then learn about dealing with those attacks/defenses. It kinda builds a path for you based on an activity you know you enjoy. This is how it clicks together for me, but it may not be the same for you.",

Luckily I started learning those 2 - 3 years ago at home and my home lab is hybrid AD now. \n\nThe smaller enclaves that are still AD, aka 'on prem', though. Good Lord, I have realized recently just how behind some \\[most?\\] of our folks are. They don't even know what a GPO is, let alone how to create, link, and edit one. They don't have a handle on PowerShell at all, let alone how to use it to query log files. Speaking of log files, I have had to explain very slowly that you need a WEC to consolidate all your DC's logs in one place. \n\nI was training one of our newer cyber guys on how to setup a WEC today, how to configure a GPO so said WEC can pull the DC's logs, what SDDL is, why SDDL even matters in 2026, when you might see SDDL again, etc. None of the other guys were paying any attention. \n\n**TL;DR** JMHO but this \"vendor specific\" stuff matters, a LOT. Theory is great to get the basics down, CompTIA is good at that stage, but eventually you have to get down in the proverbial weeds regarding the specific tech your org uses. You have to understand how it works, how to configure it, how to audit for \\[mis\\]configs, etc. Otherwise how in heaven or hell are you going to know how to secure it!? \n\n**Summary** so AD Security, or Windows Security more broadly, interests me. It's what gets me hot and bothered about the difference between DACLs & SACLs, how to query and set both, how little \\[mis\\]configs can daisy chain and create an escalation path, etc etc\n\n**The Point** when you find 'The One' you'll know. It'll be what keeps you up late at night, what makes you lose track of time, what keeps you banging away in the CLI, what crowds out all other topics when it comes to your Google search history/ChatGTP/Gemini/etc.",

The sooner you start getting exposes to cybersecurity topics and do hands-on the better for your knowledge, practice, and staying involved. HackTheBox is cool too, but I found more beginner friendly topics on TryHackMe. Sometimes even if a room or challenge says EASY...hahaha, maybe not easy for a beginner. Do it anyway. \n\nSo, depending on how much time you can give, TryHackMe is a good way to start. Think and ask yourself: can I spend 2 hours a week on TryHackMe and skip 2 hours of TV or video games?
