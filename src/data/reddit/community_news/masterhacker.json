Any other avenue of seeking assistance would be better than dealing with people like that.\n\nPart of the problem seems to be that you’d want to believe certain subreddits are in some way “authoritative”, especially when they match a company, organization, or product name. I would think r/Arduino has at least some official clout, like you’d expect from official Arduino social media accounts or something. Reddit doesn’t seem to work that way. The main subreddit for a product could be run by some absolute shitheads who have nothing to do with it and you wouldn’t know without digging like this.",
