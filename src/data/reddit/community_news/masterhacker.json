These include, but are not limited to:\n\nRudeness towards other Redditors, Spreading incorrect information, Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s. Am I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future.

Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

Even some of the files which were flagged by MS Defender were false positives.\n\nThirdly, always triple check the website u are downloading from, use an ad blocker like uBlock Origin and search up on reddit to confirm your downloading source.

Besides, there's also a high chance that OOP simply went to an imposter site instead of the real FitGirl website.\n\nAnd, oh, just to point out, FitGirl doesn't have Resident Evil 4 Remastered uploaded. They have RE4 Ultimate and Ultimate HD uploaded, but no Remastered version. Both were uploaded before 2023, so they can't be mis-titled Remastered editions. That makes it even less likely that FitGirl is to blame.\n\n—\n\nEssentially, you can't just say two things are 50/50 just because there are two options. Even if we ignore that there are actually at least 3 main options here, there's additional context and information that sway the likelihood.",
