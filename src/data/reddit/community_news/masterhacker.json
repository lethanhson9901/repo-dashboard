Next things you need to do is search it on dehashed to see all the leaks. There was recently a breach in the cellular network of all carriers, so the number should be there. You will then see the IMEI of the phone. After that, do an nmap scan on the IMEI. You should see it has port 4444 open, which is the standard port for SSH. Next off, you need to do banner grabbing with ls to see the ICMP version. Next, use gedit to find any 0 days (there is at least one for all ICMP versions). Once you find the 0 day, you can exploit it, and you are in. However, once they reboot their phone, you will lose access. To mitigate this, use ifconfig to generate a reverse shell and then use dpkg to encrypt it. Lastly, use the man command to start an anonymous proxy server so that it works over WAN, and then send it to the phone via SMTP. Now, you have full control. If you want root privileges, just use the traceroute command and it should give you the privileges.",

              "text": "The guide you've asked me to check contains a mix of real cybersecurity terms and completely false or misleading technical claims. It describes a fictional and non-functional \"hack\" that could not work as described.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the major issues:\n\n🔍 Fact vs. Fiction in the Guide\n\n· Claim: \"Search it on dehashed to see all the leaks... you will then see the IMEI of the phone.\"\n  · Reality: Fiction. Public data breach websites aggregate leaked emails and passwords. A phone number breach would not reveal a device's unique 15-digit IMEI number. The IMEI is a hardware identifier, not typically stored with user account data in breaches.\n· Claim: \"Do an nmap scan on the IMEI. You should see it has port 4444 open, which is the standard port for SSH.\"\n  · Reality: Nonsense. IMEI numbers are identifiers, not network addresses (like IP addresses). You cannot \"scan\" an IMEI with nmap. While port 4444 is sometimes used for services, it is not the \"standard port for SSH\" (which is port 22).\n· Claim: \"Use gedit to find any 0 days... use ifconfig to generate a reverse shell.\"\n  · Reality: Technically incoherent. gedit is a simple text editor for Linux desktops, not a vulnerability research tool. ifconfig is a network configuration command; it cannot \"generate\" a reverse shell. These are fundamental misrepresentations of how these tools work.\n· Claim: \"Use the man command to start an anonymous proxy server... send it to the phone via SMTP.\"\n  · Reality: Technically incoherent. The man command displays manual pages for other commands; it does not start servers. SMTP is a protocol for sending email. You cannot \"send\" a live proxy server connection via an email.\n\nUnderstanding IMEI and Real Phone Security\n\nThe guide misuses the term IMEI. Here is accurate information from search results:\n\n· What it is: The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique 15-digit code that identifies your phone's hardware, like a serial number.\n· How to find it: You can find it by dialing *#06# on most phones.\n· Its real purpose: Mobile carriers use it to identify devices on their network. If your phone is stolen, you can provide the IMEI to your carrier to block the device from accessing their network.\n· Real risks: While IMEI numbers can be targeted (e.g., through phishing or if someone has physical access to your phone), they are not a magic key for remote hacking. The primary risk is that a stolen IMEI could be used to clone a device's identity or get it fraudulently blacklisted.\n\nLegal and Ethical Warnings\n\nAttempting to access someone's device, data, or accounts without their explicit permission is a serious crime in most countries.\n\n· Federal Laws: In the United States, hacking is prosecuted under laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the Stored Communications Act (SCA), and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA).\n· Severe Penalties: Convictions can result in fines and prison sentences. For example, accessing a computer to obtain information can carry a penalty of up to one year in prison for a first conviction, and up to ten years for a second.\n· Legal Action: Victims of hacking can also bring civil lawsuits to recover damages.\n\nSigns Your Phone May Be Compromised & What to Do\n\nIf you are concerned about your own phone's security, look for these legitimate warning signs:\n\n· Rapid battery drain\n· Unexplained high data usage\n· Phone getting hot when not in heavy use\n· Slow performance\n· Appearance of unfamiliar apps\n· Pop-up ads and strange notifications\n· Unrecognized outgoing calls in your history\n\nSteps to take if you suspect a problem:\n\n1. Check for unauthorized call forwarding: Dial *#21# to see if your calls are being forwarded without your knowledge.\n2. Run a security scan: Use a reputable mobile security app to scan for malware.\n3. Update and reset: Update all apps and your phone's OS. As a last resort, back up your data and perform a factory reset.\n4. Change passwords: Update passwords for important accounts (email, banking, social media), starting from a known-clean device.\n5. Contact your carrier: If you suspect your IMEI has been compromised, contact your mobile carrier for assistance.\n\nI hope this detailed clarification is helpful. If you are interested in learning about legitimate cybersecurity and ethical hacking practices for educational purposes, I can provide information on accredited resources and training.",

              "text": "misuse of the term router?\n\n\n\nA **modulator-demodulator**, commonly referred to as a **modem**, is a [computer hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware) device that converts [data from a digital format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data) into a format suitable for an analog [transmission medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium) such as telephone or radio. A modem transmits data by [modulating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation#Digital_modulation_methods) one or more [carrier wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_wave) signals to encode [digital information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_information), while the receiver [demodulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demodulation) the signal to recreate the original digital information. The goal is to produce a [signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)) that can be transmitted easily and decoded reliably. Modems can be used with almost any means of transmitting analog signals, from [LEDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode) to [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio).\n\nRouters perform the *traffic directing* functions on the Internet. A router is connected to two or more data lines from different [IP networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_network). When a data packet comes in on a line, the router reads the [network address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address) information in the packet header to determine the ultimate destination. Then, using information in its [routing table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table) or [routing policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_policy), it directs the packet to the next network on its journey. A data packet is forwarded from one router to another through an [internetwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetwork) until it reaches its destination [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)).[^(\\[5\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)#cite_note-6)\n\n  \na modem connects to the internet. routers typically connect to the modem, and then broadcasts the signal wirelessly, or wired if you are lucky.",

I have a question: if you have a compromised kernel but logs show that the kernel is comfortable with the firmware controls, there is no suspicious internet connections, and the behavior of the operating system seems safe or at the very least non-obviously malicious, what is the purpose of having a compromised kernel and what are you expecting to do with it if it were publicly-distributed? Context: I am running a modded operating system on a disposable bare metal machine for three months and nothing alarming has been detected or done.",

Especially in countries like America with no social safety nets, absurdly low wages, massive income inequality, and rising competition with people getting into the field..  \n  \nI'm not talking about the over worked cyber-security dudes working at an MSP or for some small tech startup. I'm talking about the college graduates and veterans aiming to get into these large multi-national corporations with actual body counts behind them, with no signs of stopping.
