I posted this on kiwifarms originally:\n\nconnecting to a VPN before tor is always superior, do not listen to retards like mental outlaw who simply regurgitate dogma from boomers who refuse to learn new tricks or how the underlying technology they are making claims about actually works. reasons why include:\n\n1. arguments as to whether VPNs log are speculative, however your ISP logging is a certainty. when you connect to a VPN before tor you are shifting trust to the VPN provider, yes, but if you forego this step then you are choosing to trust your ISP instead. \n\n2. tor users can be deanonymized using end-to-end correlation attacks, in very early blogs tor devs confirm this, and there's a variety of ways these attacks can work. could be that multiple law enforcement agencies are spinning up nodes or simply forcing node providers to keep/hand over connection logs, could be an exchange-level attack where they exploit vulnerabilities in BGP routing in order to adopt a privileged position that eases correlation, could be SIGINT that monitors exit nodes and is combined with dragnet surveillance (any IP in their country that connects to tor) to make inferences about who connected to which guard node or exit node, how much data was transmitted and for how long the connection was established.\n\nVPNs do not solve these fundamental issues with tor but when configured properly, they make deanonymization extremely difficult even for the most advanced adversaries. one very important caveat is that you should always use multihop, ive written enough already but connecting to one server and then tor isn't enough nowadays to fully prevent correlation, if someone wants me to elaborate then I will.",

Most of those sites won’t have a puzzle or weird path to finding the url like in games or YouTube ARGs, the sites transient and only available for those who got the full .onion url from those who know.",

I could see his sweat under the mask, no joke. When I won, he gave me his 2012 BTC bundle, no joke, serious things - 2012 was the time BTC were just young no ones from China messing around with music, not the great band that they are now.

I don’t want my phone or whatever to be finger printed or monitored. Gay as honestly. \n\nFrom what I can tell it’s pure larp and also if I wanted to buy drugs I can go on fucking telegram or WhatsApp. If it gets busted, all they know is that I bought it. And plus when I do by drugs it’s only weed so ecen then it would be a slap on the wrist. Also the vendors on telegram and WhatsApp literally sell other things like acid or shrooms. Anything else after that like experimentals are lowk something I’d avoid. I’d rather not die in the event I’m magically allergic to it at pure randomnesss or it straight puts me in psychosis or are on a trip for several days straight. Also if on the off chance I want to try salvia or datura. I could just buy a plant or seed online and grow it myself. \n\nAlso if you go on the dark web and you use it for CSAM I hope you get caught because your waste to society and if people’s morals weren’t so high you’d be shot or beaten to death. Hey that’s what prison is for \n\nAll normal people would honestly just appreciate what’s already there. And if you’re buying drugs that are delivered at that point you deserve to get caught. There’s so many other ways to get it. Like some guy knows a guy or stuff like that. \n\nThat’s my piece on it tbh. Epstein could have used smth like that to blackmail people instead. Yeesh.",

At that point you could use your control of their DNS to redirect their requests to whatever sites you want to a local reverse proxy that doesn't allow HTTPS clients. Hopefully they don't have HTTPS only mode turned on and don't notice the lack of a lock icon. Also gotta make sure to drop all packets bound for the real site so their DNS cache doesn't mess things up. \n\nSo yeah, with some luck you can bypass HTTPS without decrypting it if you're on their LAN.
