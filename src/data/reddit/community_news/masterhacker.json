These include, but are not limited to:\n\nRudeness towards other Redditors, Spreading incorrect information, Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s. Am I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future.

Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

So its like living in a world where you first meet your friend at starbucks and then they take you to their home.  effectively you Cant network among yourselves without a thridparty invervening\n\ngo try and make a apache webserver on your phone.  it would be a smart thing to have really..   but you cant because inbound connections that havent been requested will be blocked.\n\nor how about a webserver on your towerpc for a local group or a shared documets webserver.  you cant do that without a business class ip address.\n\nso How we use the internet is shaped so we use large websites to communicate.\n\nIt's like our front doors to our 'home' is for use with a company's website in conjuction always for non-business class ip addresses.\n\nfor ipv6 there are ass many addresses as atoms on the surface of the earth.  the addresses themselves can be symbolic of information so much that pinging them can indicate messages.\n\nif governments really wanted to End ddos as a threat theyd take an approach similar to how the FCC addresses broadcast crimes.  but they wont because its how peopple and sites are censored because they cant hardware exploit each time or people get skittish about coputer tech that way\n\nlack of common data diodes,,  common ipv6 filtering...   two ways the internet is fucked prodigiously",

They do not want any random person to send traffic trying to spoof spam as legitimate emails over port 25. That is why most ISPs block that traffic. Nothing to do with ddos.\n\nAnd you can definitely host your own webserver.

Even some of the files which were flagged by MS Defender were false positives.\n\nThirdly, always triple check the website u are downloading from, use an ad blocker like uBlock Origin and search up on reddit to confirm your downloading source.

          "text": "So to respond to u/Fun_Language6541 [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/masterhacker/comments/1qlc221/comment/o1it1z2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nKeep in mind I'm not an expert in this field so yeah take this with a grain of salt but this is my research for fun since I've got bored of playing League DISCLAIMER: Always use a VM/sandbox environment for this stuff! I started from the setup.exe file which is the common entry point for malware on your PC.\n\nFirst things first [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/31f3c9456b91152ee98d408a4e7952ea09067416734172eac163e1cebd4b8096/detection) scan.\n\nAs you can see it gives us a 1/72 result and it's from a GData AV which imo it's not that popular nor good, but yeah most of the better AV's (ESET, Kaspersky and Malwarebytes) are showing the file as clean which just by that I would say it's a false positive.\n\nBut let's go deeper\n\nFirst thing I did was this:\n\n    strings setup.exe  > setup.txt\n\nI checked if the files had any weird strings pointing to weird domains or IP's and guess what there are none. So let's dig even further from the extracted strings u get this string Inno Setup Setup Data (5.5.0) (u), which indicates that the repack was done via Inno. Now go to the original FG website and see FAQ, she uses Inno.\n\nSo let's install a tool called innoextract:\n\n    sudo apt update\n    sudo apt install innoextract\n\nNow let's run it on the setup.exe:\n\n    innoextract setup.exe\n\n[OUTPUT](https://paste.sh/CgLTN5eF#NTtSo7elZoNw_-4iYiNom6dQ)\n\nSo we get a list of files and we can get a general look of how the setup works unarc.dll stands out because it's the engine to unpack the compressed game, cls-srep.exe, cls-magic2.dll and oo2core_7_win64.dll are the specific decompression algorithms, which is normal for a repack u need to decompress the data somehow.\n\ntmp/host.cmd and tmp/hosts.exe are used to create entries in your hosts file in Windows so even if you go to a wrong FG website it will redirect you to the original one. We can see what's inside them by running:\n\n    strings tmp/host.cmd > hosts.txt\n\nNow there are also tmp/rz.exe and rzw.exe and these are tools for registry registration or small patching tasks.\n\nNow let's check the decompressor file unarc.dll:\n\n    strings tmp/unarc.dll > unarc.txt\n\nIf you analyze the unarc.dll file, you’ll see references to Blowfish, Twofish, Serpent, and AES which are all standard algorithms used for handling encrypted archives. It also references arc.ini and External compressor: lvtex, which is the standard configuration for the Unarc library to communicate with compression plugins. Most importantly, there are no network calls (no URLs or IP addresses) within this library. The reason it often triggers AV scanners is the large amount of compressed data at the end of the file, the high entropy causes the AV to flag it as a false positive, mistaking the compressed game data for an encrypted malicious payload.\n\nNow remember the original output of the\n\n    strings setup.exe\n\nIn the setup.exe strings, you can see references to network libraries like UrlMon and WinInet. These are standard Windows APIs that allow applications to interact with HTTP and FTP protocols. Specifically, WinInet is used by installers to download supplemental components from the web!\n\nNow you mentioned an IP address in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/masterhacker/comments/1qlc221/comment/o1ipcjp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nLet's see:\n\n    whois 199.232.214.172\n\n[OUTPUT](https://paste.sh/d3NRzD9i#nMjmBLNHpBLueikGtHEFY0yl)\n\nThis IP belongs to Fastly which is a CDN (Content Delivery Network), but wait:\n\n    nslookup bg.microsoft.map.fastly.net\n\n[OUTPUT](https://paste.sh/8L1AXl4w#pmLUzWVu4BTWip0UyVYFsLq7)\n\nHmmm the IP is a CDN for Microsoft ?\n\nWell guess what inside app/_Redist/ there is dxwebsetup.exe or a DirectX Web Installer let's do strings :)\n\n    strings app/_Redist/dxwebsetup.exe > dxweb.txt\n\nHmmmm look at this string in the OUTPUT:\n\n    PA\"dxwsetup.exe\" /windowsupdate\n\nWhen the DirectX Web installer calls the /windowsupdate flag it is told hey ignore local files and fetch the latest versions from Microsoft's online servers.\n\nNow we come to ADVAPI32.dll which is used for OpenProcessToken and RegQueryValueExA, this allows the installer to check your system's registry and permission levels to see if it has the rights to install new components. KERNEL32.dll which contains the core functions to manage the download process for example CreateThread and WaitForSingleObject these are used to manage the download and installation processes in the background without freezing the UI, and we come to urlman and wininet, these are the \"messengers\", the strings show a temporary directory being set up msdownld.tmp. These libraries then use standard Windows networking to resolve the Microsoft/Fastly domain into the specific IP address YOU ARE LINKING.\n\nNow let's do this:\n\n    sudo apt install osslsigncode\n    osslsigncode verify dxwebsetup.exe\n\nBut before that since it's an old certificate Ubuntu doesn't have it by default so we need to download it from Microsoft.\n\n    wget -U \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/119.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\" http://www.microsoft.com/pki/certs/MicrosoftRootAuthority.crt\n\nNow we convert binary to text:\n\n    openssl x509 -inform der -in MicrosoftRootAuthority.crt -out microsoft_root_1997.crt\n\nNow we copy the certificate into the correct folder:\n\n    sudo cp microsoft_root_1997.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/\n\nUpdate the certificates in Ubuntu:\n\n    sudo update-ca-certificates\n\nRun the osslsigncode command again:\n\n    osslsigncode verify dxwebsetup.exe\n\n[OUTPUT](https://paste.sh/XpBDEUSi#jF2_HWm0TFOOgL68OsdOjjMr)\n\nWell well well, now we can see that this installer is 100% authentic Microsoft binary, the file was signed in 2009 by Microsoft Root Authority. Which means your claim about the suspicious IP is just an IP coming from a CDN for the official DirectX installer. \n\nNevertheless, FG is a trusted and reputable repacker so she wouldn't upload malware into her repacks, but wait she even went as far to call another repacker who uploaded malware in his repacks a few weeks ago. So yeah I believe you have gotten malware on your PC from somewhere else but not from FG, stay safe, check the megathread and FMHY resources.\n\nReinstall Windows from a USB stick, change your passwords to something random the longer the better plus a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and characters.

Out of all the 3 games u listed, only one game isn't on the FG site and that is the RE4 Remake, which prolly means you got the malware from that game, or who knows I can't know which links you have clicked and which sites you visited and what stuff did you download and ran on your PC. But next time if you claim something provide evidence not just \"trust me bro\". If you wanna prove that there is malware open Ghidra or IDA and do a detailed analysis and then post it. \n\nAs for FG I've used her repacks for about 6/7 years on my main PC and I've never had a problem ever. That's why I and prolly other ppl trust her repacks so much. Not everything is about money btw some ppl do it as a hobby some do it for the respect, some do it for the challenge and some do it to help others. \n\nFinally you do you bro, stay safe, it's not fun to get hacked and get money stolen I hope you have moved on, recovered everything, refunded the money, changed ur passwords, reinstalled your OS and I wish you the best in life stay positive and safe, have a nice day.",

Besides, there's also a high chance that OOP simply went to an imposter site instead of the real FitGirl website.\n\nAnd, oh, just to point out, FitGirl doesn't have Resident Evil 4 Remastered uploaded. They have RE4 Ultimate and Ultimate HD uploaded, but no Remastered version. Both were uploaded before 2023, so they can't be mis-titled Remastered editions. That makes it even less likely that FitGirl is to blame.\n\n—\n\nEssentially, you can't just say two things are 50/50 just because there are two options.

Next things you need to do is search it on dehashed to see all the leaks. There was recently a breach in the cellular network of all carriers, so the number should be there. You will then see the IMEI of the phone. After that, do an nmap scan on the IMEI. You should see it has port 4444 open, which is the standard port for SSH. Next off, you need to do banner grabbing with ls to see the ICMP version. Next, use gedit to find any 0 days (there is at least one for all ICMP versions). Once you find the 0 day, you can exploit it, and you are in. However, once they reboot their phone, you will lose access. To mitigate this, use ifconfig to generate a reverse shell and then use dpkg to encrypt it. Lastly, use the man command to start an anonymous proxy server so that it works over WAN, and then send it to the phone via SMTP. Now, you have full control. If you want root privileges, just use the traceroute command and it should give you the privileges.",

              "text": "The guide you've asked me to check contains a mix of real cybersecurity terms and completely false or misleading technical claims. It describes a fictional and non-functional \"hack\" that could not work as described.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the major issues:\n\n🔍 Fact vs. Fiction in the Guide\n\n· Claim: \"Search it on dehashed to see all the leaks... you will then see the IMEI of the phone.\"\n  · Reality: Fiction. Public data breach websites aggregate leaked emails and passwords. A phone number breach would not reveal a device's unique 15-digit IMEI number. The IMEI is a hardware identifier, not typically stored with user account data in breaches.\n· Claim: \"Do an nmap scan on the IMEI. You should see it has port 4444 open, which is the standard port for SSH.\"\n  · Reality: Nonsense. IMEI numbers are identifiers, not network addresses (like IP addresses). You cannot \"scan\" an IMEI with nmap. While port 4444 is sometimes used for services, it is not the \"standard port for SSH\" (which is port 22).\n· Claim: \"Use gedit to find any 0 days... use ifconfig to generate a reverse shell.\"\n  · Reality: Technically incoherent. gedit is a simple text editor for Linux desktops, not a vulnerability research tool. ifconfig is a network configuration command; it cannot \"generate\" a reverse shell. These are fundamental misrepresentations of how these tools work.\n· Claim: \"Use the man command to start an anonymous proxy server... send it to the phone via SMTP.\"\n  · Reality: Technically incoherent. The man command displays manual pages for other commands; it does not start servers. SMTP is a protocol for sending email. You cannot \"send\" a live proxy server connection via an email.\n\nUnderstanding IMEI and Real Phone Security\n\nThe guide misuses the term IMEI. Here is accurate information from search results:\n\n· What it is: The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique 15-digit code that identifies your phone's hardware, like a serial number.\n· How to find it: You can find it by dialing *#06# on most phones.\n· Its real purpose: Mobile carriers use it to identify devices on their network. If your phone is stolen, you can provide the IMEI to your carrier to block the device from accessing their network.\n· Real risks: While IMEI numbers can be targeted (e.g., through phishing or if someone has physical access to your phone), they are not a magic key for remote hacking. The primary risk is that a stolen IMEI could be used to clone a device's identity or get it fraudulently blacklisted.\n\nLegal and Ethical Warnings\n\nAttempting to access someone's device, data, or accounts without their explicit permission is a serious crime in most countries.\n\n· Federal Laws: In the United States, hacking is prosecuted under laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the Stored Communications Act (SCA), and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA).\n· Severe Penalties: Convictions can result in fines and prison sentences. For example, accessing a computer to obtain information can carry a penalty of up to one year in prison for a first conviction, and up to ten years for a second.\n· Legal Action: Victims of hacking can also bring civil lawsuits to recover damages.\n\nSigns Your Phone May Be Compromised & What to Do\n\nIf you are concerned about your own phone's security, look for these legitimate warning signs:\n\n· Rapid battery drain\n· Unexplained high data usage\n· Phone getting hot when not in heavy use\n· Slow performance\n· Appearance of unfamiliar apps\n· Pop-up ads and strange notifications\n· Unrecognized outgoing calls in your history\n\nSteps to take if you suspect a problem:\n\n1. Check for unauthorized call forwarding: Dial *#21# to see if your calls are being forwarded without your knowledge.\n2. Run a security scan: Use a reputable mobile security app to scan for malware.\n3. Update and reset: Update all apps and your phone's OS. As a last resort, back up your data and perform a factory reset.\n4. Change passwords: Update passwords for important accounts (email, banking, social media), starting from a known-clean device.\n5. Contact your carrier: If you suspect your IMEI has been compromised, contact your mobile carrier for assistance.\n\nI hope this detailed clarification is helpful. If you are interested in learning about legitimate cybersecurity and ethical hacking practices for educational purposes, I can provide information on accredited resources and training.",
