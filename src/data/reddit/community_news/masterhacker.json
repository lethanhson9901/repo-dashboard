Even mullvad vpn should not be fully trusted on its own. Although many vpns including proton are still better than nothing if you're in some countries (such as the uk right now). I mean tbf the uk government literally has no tech understanding so i guess that helps (they tried age restricting vpns... yeah...). But this is where tor and i2p shine (like using i2p for ultra secret hidden services/trying to talk about being transgender without being classified as a \"degenerate\" by the government, and also tor for using tor hidden services and also normal websites, the \"darkweb\" (unfortunate probably state sponsored nickname, or something pssht idk) might sound scary but its actually the best anonymisation toolset that we've got, and most \"darkweb\" websites are just like not filled with cp? It's the media that portrays the darkweb as being the centre for criminal activities). ",

              "text": "Normally when it comes to security, you would aim for a distro such as qubes, whonix or tails OS. Even the most secure OS won't protect against user stupidity. Your ISP can tell if you are on TOR or not, but the attack surface of one is limited, the content is encrypted following normal protocols and standards, not only that but it passes by multiple nodes (3 to be more exact, limiting traceability by normal threat actors if you are not a criminal worthy of nation-sponsored threat actors). The main concern with tor is the fingerprinting, the opsec of the user, the viruses and exploits on it, but again, if you are not a national criminal, the chance of it happening are way lower. The public IP will remain the same, but it's not limited to a device, but a router, so on a public network, it's some efforts to see which device, which local ip address made a request to x DNS server, if you switch device, it makes it a little bit harder to map to a device only.\n\nEdit: I forgot about the VPN part, but a vpn, especially if free, is more of a tool to redirect local traffic to an entity (such as VPS, data centers etc), only then could you say that a VPN is better if it was audited properly, follows standards, does not leak DNS and has a zero log policy.",

I could tell this because the street signs were a different color that is used over there. Even though you could only clearly see the street name, you could make out the outline of the hundred block. I knew it could either be a 500 or 800. So I started with 800, and found the area on Google Maps. I went up the street until I got to a T intersection that was facing backyard fences instead of front yards. Sure enough, that was 500 block and you could see the same window on the back of somebody's house, the same way that the fence changed from two horizontal boards to three, and then you could see the same discolored bricks on the side of her garage, matching up with the picture she used.\n\nI outlined this process to her so she would understand how much identifiable information was in the picture. I even showed how I did a property lookup to see that she actually was the one living there, and from there how I was able to find her close family.",

So yes, kali is bloated, unstable in the long but that is about it as far as the disadvantages go. It was the entrypoint for most of the people i know in the EH community.
