The same with -SV its an invalid option. Anyway its not stealth a 3 way tcp handshake goes SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK. Its easy to detect repeated SYN SYN SYN SYN... from a single IP so there's nothing stealth about it. It used to be stealth because a tcp handshake would never complete therefore no connection logged but nowadays an IDS/IPS would detect this scan immediately.",

I also wonder about this, but someone said these scans are normal (it means there will be scanning in large as usual) in these sites like nasa or .gov websites. Is that True?
