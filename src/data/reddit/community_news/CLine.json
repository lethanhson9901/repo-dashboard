      "text": "**TL;DR:** Redesigned terminal UI, better support for running parallel agents, ACP integration for Zed/Neovim/Emacs, and free Kimi K2.5 access (and more to come…).\n\nHey r/Cline 👋.\n\nThe team has been working hard on Cline CLI over the past few weeks and we're happy to share some updates that should make the whole experience feel a lot more usable.\n\nHere’s what’s changing:\n\n# Next notch interactive experience within terminal \n\nWe rebuilt the CLI from the ground up to make it look and feel like the Cline you're used to in VS Code, making it easier to transition from the IDE to the terminal. Plan/Act modes, easy Auto-approve toggle, and powerful slash commands.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1quzieq/video/qqrycnawlbhg1/player\n\n# Improved parallel agents\n\nYou can spin up separate Cline instances across tmux panes or terminal tabs. One agent refactoring your DB layer while another updates docs on a different branch, all seamlessly happening with Cline CLIs. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1quzieq/video/tqrmcwptlbhg1/player\n\n# ACP support: use Cline in Zed, Neovim, and more\n\nCline now works with ACP-compatible editors through the[ cline-acp adapter](https://github.com/Tonksthebear/cline-acp). That means you can run Cline directly inside Zed, Neovim (via CodeCompanion or avante.nvim), Emacs, and any other editor that uses ACP.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1quzieq/video/j76zqrhulbhg1/player\n\n# Automate with headless pipelines\n\nCline CLI is fully scriptable. Use the -y flag to skip all permissions in autonomous CI/CD pipelines, pipe logs as stdin directly into the CLI, and use the --json flag to parse output easily.\n\nAutomate what makes sense. Stay in control of the rest.\n\n# Free Kimi K2.5 access (for a limited time!)\n\nWe added support for[ Kimi K2.5](https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html), Moonshot's open-source model. It's strong on agentic tasks and significantly cheaper than the big closed models, though Opus still edges it out on some pure coding benchmarks. The free access is temporary, so make the most of it while you can.\n\nMore on our launch here: [**https://cline.bot/blog/announcing-cline-cli-2-0**](https://cline.bot/blog/announcing-cline-cli-2-0)\n\nFor a limited time, we’re also making it possible for you to experiment for free with Kimi K2.5 one of the best open-source models available, Kimi K2.5.\n\nYour feedback is what lets us continue to deliver a great product for the open-source community. We’d love to hear from you.",

The issue is with the redirect. It was an issue i had a few months ago where i couldn't log into cline in vs code(insiders)(windows 11). I couldn't complete the auth., meaning i could log into the account in the browser(edge/chrome, it doesn't work for both), i completed the auth successfully, but the redirect is not redirecting, and the cline extension don't detect it. resulting in not being able to log into an account (i tried with 2 Google accounts, both failed). So i stopped using it, because i couldn't log in to use it. And didn't want to troubleshoot this. A FEW MONTHS AGO.\n\nSaw the release post about Cline CLI 2.0 and the free Kimmy, and i decided to enable the extension and see what changed, but i couldn't, because of the exact same blocking issue i had  a few months ago. So again i can't use the extension....\n\nI would love for it to be fixed so i can try you out and be impressed, because usually i was disappointed with major releases because of some blocking bug or some reliability issues and stopped using it because of that.",

Big improvements in reasoning, long context handling, and agentic tasks. If you've been using Opus 4.5 for complex work, this is a straight upgrade.\n\n**Benchmarks**\n\n* 80.8% on SWE-Bench Verified\n* 65.4% on Terminal-Bench 2.0 (state of the art)\n* 68.8% on ARC-AGI-2 (up from 37.6% on Opus 4.5)\n* 1M token context window\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2oey9305frhg1.png?width=2002&format=png&auto=webp&s=052b7167a430731d196e885b232b735c9892015d\n\nTwo things stood out to me reading the system card:\n\n1. **It doesn't lose the plot.** 1M token context window and it actually uses it well. If you've ever had a model forget what you told it three prompts ago, you'll feel the difference here. The long context recall is significantly better than previous models. You can throw an entire codebase at it and it keeps track.\n2. **It infers intent better.** You don't have to be as precise with your prompts. It's better at figuring out what you actually want even when you're being vague. Less babysitting, more just saying what you need.\n\n**When to use it**\n\nOpus 4.6 is the model for hard tasks. Complex refactors, multi-file changes, debugging something weird, anything where you need the model to hold a lot of context and think carefully.\n\nFor quick everyday stuff, Sonnet is still faster and cheaper.\n\n**How to use it**\n\nSelect claude-opus-4-6 from the model picker. Works with your Anthropic API key.\n\nWorks in your terminal, JetBrains, VS Code, Zed, Neovim, and Emacs.\n\nCurious to hear how it works for you all. What are you throwing at it?",

Minimax 2.1 2-3$ plan with promo is also super for this purpose but it is ended afaik atm. Google pro plan could be good for 8-10$ because flash 3 is better than minimax m2.1 IMO. Though, I hate to pay for the plans which have student plan equilevent because this makes the plan abusive and I feel as silly. That's why I avoid Google pro plan and we saw there how they messed up. ​",

If you're RAM-constrained, a 4-bit quantized 32B model runs in ~20GB VRAM and will still dramatically outperform a 10B at this.\n\nLet me know how it goes!",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI’ve been using **Cline** pretty consistently since around **December 2025** for a business startup I’m working on, and I wanted to sanity-check how others are handling **context and memory management**.\n\nMy setup so far:\n\n* I have a **ChatGPT Plus** subscription and mostly use ChatGPT in the browser as the *“brain”*:\n   * documenting decisions\n   * defining tasks\n   * refining prompts\n* Then I use **Cline** to actually *execute* the work (coding, refactors, changes, etc).\n* From early on, I had **Cline rules** in place (mainly guardrails around Python dev and workflow discipline).\n* I’ve also tried to be very deliberate about **documentation** as I go.\n\nOne thing I noticed pretty quickly was that my **context window was huge** — often **200k+ tokens**, even just kicking off fairly simple prompts. At the time, I only really had:\n\n* a basic `.clinerules` folder\n* no `.clineignore`\n* no structured memory management beyond “keep docs in the repo”\n\nRecently I started digging more seriously into **context optimisation and memory banks**.\n\nWhat I’ve done since:\n\n* Adapted the **basic memory bank concept** from the official Cline docs\n* Added a `.clineignore` (which I’d completely ignored before 😅)\n* Tightened what actually needs to load into context vs what can live “cold”\n\nThat alone dropped my starting context to about **40,000 tokens**, which I’m honestly very happy with. It’s made a *huge* difference:\n\n* I can use **smaller, cheaper models**\n* Faster iteration\n* Less accidental context pollution\n\nThat said, I’ve noticed:\n\n* Some users have built **much more advanced rule sets** that are deployable by using their repo first and dropping your project files into the src folder\n* Others talk about **recursive chain of though** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1iscdag/cline\\_recursive\\_chainofthought\\_system\\_crct/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1iscdag/cline_recursive_chainofthought_system_crct/)\n* And at the far end, there are **RAG-based approaches** (vector DBs, separate servers indexing the whole repo, etc.). Examples include Memento CLI and ByteRover 2.0\n\nSo I’m curious:\n\n1. **What are people actually using in practice right now?**\n   * Simple memory banks?\n   * Heavier rule-driven approaches?\n   * Full RAG setups?\n2. **Where’s the trade-off point** where complexity stops being worth it?\n3. **Does Cline have anything on the roadmap** around:\n   * first-class memory management\n   * smarter context loading\n   * or better tooling inside the extension itself?\n\nRight now, the memory bank + ignore approach feels like a good balance for me, but I’d love to hear what’s working (or not working) for others.\n\nDisclaimer: I used AI to help me write this, because I don't know all the fancy terms.

LLMs perform worse as you approach 128k. Sometimes well before that.\n\n\nA fresh chat I find increases the chance of not having to re do a task again.\n\n\nIf you break down your tasks, it can be done in discrete chunks where having a long running memory would be a waste if it never takes advantage of it.",
