Be verbose in verification.  Point out potential problems.  Let the user ask for suggestions as follow ups unless the fix is small and minimal. \n2. If a specific kind of file is changed then check this file adheres to the specified pattern of X.  Here I reference another .md file that defines the pattern. It kind of lazy loads this documentation. \n\n\nI generally prefer the first round of feedback to be potential problems and a wide net rather than having concise responses that make my brain have low activity.  I want to use my brain, and would prefer skimming too much info rather than having too little info and not critically thinking. \n\nIf there’s enough interest, I can share my prompt in a gist.  But I’m here genuinely to learn from all of you and hear what you’re doing. ",

Check whether the Form ID uses the new scheme. If so, generate a new Form ID, store it in the database, and update the form.\n2. If the Form ID uses the old scheme, check whether it was created after February 2022. If yes, convert it to the new ID, store it in the database, and update the form.\n3. Otherwise, ask a developer to fix the issue manually.\n\nThis would be my prompt for Cline, but where should I put it? Should it be a rule, a workflow, or a skill?\n\nI just want to be able to copy and paste the error message into the chat and have Cline fix it.\n\nAlso, how should I organize such files so that Cline can easily find the relevant one?\n\n",
