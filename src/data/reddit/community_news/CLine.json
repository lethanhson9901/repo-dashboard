      "text": "I just started using Cline today, and I am floored. So I wanted to share some real progress. \n\n  \nI use the Plan / Act function with Gemini. I use Gemini 3.1 Pro for the Plan function and Gemini 3 Flash for the Act function. Obviously, I use my API key.\n\nI'm developing a voice-first producivity app, so it's not the most complex app but mine is far from simple in code (usability is simple though). Lot's of moving parts. \n\nI used it for a few hours this morning, and I wanted to show exactly what I accomplished and how much it cost:\n\n   Key Changes:\n\n   1. Focus Mode Countdown:\n\n• Added a toggleable \"Countdown\" mode to the CompanionMode component.\n\n• Implemented an elegant duration picker modal with quick presets (5m, 15m, 25m, 45m, 60m) and manual input.\n\n• The countdown stops automatically at 00:00 and integrates seamlessly with the existing breathing animation.\n\n   2. Camera to List (New Feature):\n\n• Updated the Android bridge and Cloud Function to support image-based task extraction.\n\n• Users can now take a photo of a physical list to automatically generate tasks in the app.\n\n   3. Enhanced Metadata:\n\n• Added full creation details (Created Date - Time - Day: X) directly under the Task Title in the editor.\n\n• Added a condensed age summary (Created Date - Day: X) to the task cards in the main list.\n\n   4. Robustness & Cleanup:\n\n• Improved voice recording to handle phone call interruptions by auto-cancelling the session.\n\n• Removed the deprecated \"Pivotal\" and \"7-Day Priority Pulse\" features to simplify category management.\n\n\n\nall for $4.94",

      "text": "OpenAI made GPT-5.3-Codex generally available today. We added support for it in Cline 3.67.1, so you can select it and start using it right away without managing an API key.\n\n**What's different about this model:**\n\n- 25% faster than 5.2 Codex\n- 1st place on SWE-Bench Pro, which spans 4 languages (not just Python like SWE-Bench Verified)\n- Nearly 2x on OSWorld — 38% → 65%. This is end-to-end agentic task completion, so it maps pretty directly to the kind of multi-step, multi-file work you do in Cline\n- Fewer tokens per task than any prior OpenAI model\n\nThe speed and token efficiency improvements are the real wins here. Runs finish faster and cost less. The OSWorld jump is worth paying attention to if you care about how well the model handles longer, multi-step tasks rather than isolated completions.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\nSelect GPT-5.3-Codex from the model dropdown in Cline. No API key setup required.\n\nIf you try it out, would be curious to hear how it compares to whatever you're currently running, especially on larger repos or longer tasks where the agentic improvements should be most noticeable.\n\n- Juan 🫡\n",

What I'd like is to be able to set up favorites such that I can quickly and easily choose between:\nNano-GPT/GLM\nNano-GPT/Gemini\nNano-GPT/Kimi\nOpenRouter/Claude Sonnet\nOpenAI/ChatGPT\n\nThis would allow me to quickly switch to a cheaper model for personal projects and doc review, then switch to an expensive model when I need to deep-dive or one-shot a problem. \n\nI'd also really like to see it be able to spawn sub-agents using non-Anthropic models. I don't think I've seen it do that, but I suspect GLM and Kimi would play well in that environment. Bonus points if I can use a cheaper model for simple agentic tasks like parsing files and save the expensive models for coding and planning.\n",

          "text": "the problem with not doing a monorepo is really scaling your first step (creating a folder, adding some info for the agent, cloning stuff) to an entire team.  there are plenty ways to accomplish this (like symlinks), but i've found doing a monorepo for greenfield projects makes the most sense. if the agent needs guidance to find stuff, then update the docs.\n\nalso remember that just because its a monorepo it doesn't have to be a monolith.",
