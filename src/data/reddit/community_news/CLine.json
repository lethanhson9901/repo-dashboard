      "text": "I have successfully used Cline’s memory-bank in a single-project repository, primarily to preserve context across multiple Cline tasks in a large codebase. In practice, when I notice the LLM context window approaching its token limit, I ask Cline to “update memory bank,” then start a new task and instruct it to “follow your custom instructions,” allowing work to resume from where it previously stopped.\n\nHowever, I am unclear on the best way to apply memory-bank in a monorepo setup. Our repository is structured as follows:\n\n    mono-repo\n      - serviceA\n      - serviceB\n      - serviceZ\n    \n\nMultiple teams will be working on different services concurrently.\n\n**Question 1:**  \nIn this scenario, what is the recommended memory-bank structure?\n\nOption A — a centralized memory-bank at the repo root, partitioned by service:\n\n    mono-repo\n      - serviceA\n      - serviceB\n      - serviceZ\n      - memory-bank\n          - serviceA\n              - projectBrief.md\n              - techContext.md\n          - serviceB\n              - projectBrief.md\n              - techContext.md\n    \n\nOption B — a dedicated memory-bank within each service:\n\n    mono-repo\n      - serviceA\n          - memory-bank\n              - projectBrief.md\n              - techContext.md\n      - serviceB\n          - memory-bank\n              - projectBrief.md\n              - techContext.md\n      - serviceZ\n          - memory-bank\n              - projectBrief.md\n              - techContext.md\n    \n\n**Question 2:**  \nOnce a task is complete, should all memory-bank markdown files be committed? My understanding is that files such as [`activeContext.md`](http://activeContext.md) and [`progress.md`](http://progress.md) are task-specific and primarily used to track in-flight work, so I do not see a strong reason to commit them after task completion.\n\n**Question 3:**  \nIf we implement multiple features on the same service (e.g., `feature1`, `feature2` on `serviceA`), is the expectation that memory-bank will continuously evolve? Specifically, should files like [`projectBrief.md`](http://projectBrief.md) and [`productContext.md`](http://productContext.md) be incrementally updated after each completed task to reflect the current state of the service?\n\n",

In my experience cline can work with this structure, and saves you from having to update cline config all the time to tell it which memory-bank to use.\n\nMy understanding is similar for the context files you mention, I decided to let cline handle updating context and check them in, but I think you got something there. I don't see the value in having them versions.\n\nYeah, I think the memory-bank is supposed to continue to evolve. Also I think cline updates it from time to time.",

It's a 400B parameter MoE model (13B active at inference) with 128K context. Benchmarks: MMLU Pro 82, GPQA Diamonds 75. Good for general coding, refactoring, and working with large codebases without worrying about API costs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsuctple45gg1.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc7f6d67ebb8220a272b861d2d72122487111318\n\n\n\nKimi K2.5 is open source and competitive with closed-source options. 1T parameter MoE, 256K context. Scores 76.8% on SWE-bench and beats Opus 4.5 on Humanity's Last Exam (50.2%). Particularly strong for visual coding: drop a screenshot and get working UI code with layout, animations, and interactions. It can also inspect its own output and self-correct.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c40qpg3e45gg1.png?width=1974&format=png&auto=webp&s=22379d0ec8b9a51d7062863ee3eb2518f892ccd4\n\n\n\nAlso a reminder in this release: ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscribers can use GPT-5 models in Cline via OAuth (no API key needed) and **Grok Code Fast 1** and **Devstral** free promotions have ended.\n\nFull details: [https://cline.bot/blog/cline-3-55-0-arcee-trinity-and-kimi-k2-5-now-in-cline](https://cline.bot/blog/cline-3-55-0-arcee-trinity-and-kimi-k2-5-now-in-cline)",
