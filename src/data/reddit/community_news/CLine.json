[clavix.dev](http://clavix.dev) as planning / prd / tasks management tool to ensure that input you give the agent is top level - so the output will be high aswell. And don't overthink.",

It's way harder to stay in flow state when you have these pause and wait periods.\n\nI typically have 2 meaningful changes in-flight so while one agent is planning or implementing a PR in the background I'm reviewing a plan from another agent. When things are going well there's a back-and-forth rhythm between planning and reviewing and testing code. Two parallel features is the max that's still fun for me\n\nThis is actually basically the same problem manager or tech leads have had forever. You're responsible for a whole team's delivery and all you can do is provide feedback and wait.\n\nAlso I'm waiting for an agent to finish rn lol",
