It's a 400B parameter MoE model (13B active at inference) with 128K context. Benchmarks: MMLU Pro 82, GPQA Diamonds 75. Good for general coding, refactoring, and working with large codebases without worrying about API costs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsuctple45gg1.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc7f6d67ebb8220a272b861d2d72122487111318\n\n\n\nKimi K2.5 is open source and competitive with closed-source options. 1T parameter MoE, 256K context. Scores 76.8% on SWE-bench and beats Opus 4.5 on Humanity's Last Exam (50.2%). Particularly strong for visual coding: drop a screenshot and get working UI code with layout, animations, and interactions. It can also inspect its own output and self-correct.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c40qpg3e45gg1.png?width=1974&format=png&auto=webp&s=22379d0ec8b9a51d7062863ee3eb2518f892ccd4\n\n\n\nAlso a reminder in this release: ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscribers can use GPT-5 models in Cline via OAuth (no API key needed) and **Grok Code Fast 1** and **Devstral** free promotions have ended.\n\nFull details: [https://cline.bot/blog/cline-3-55-0-arcee-trinity-and-kimi-k2-5-now-in-cline](https://cline.bot/blog/cline-3-55-0-arcee-trinity-and-kimi-k2-5-now-in-cline)",

Edit: I have Claude code + glm Max plan combo. I asked this question for parallel side basic tasks and free fast models. It seems that only option I have is qwen coder. Minimax 2.1 2-3$ plan with promo is also super for this purpose but it is ended afaik atm. Google pro plan could be good for 8-10$ because flash 3 is better than minimax m2.1 IMO. Though, I hate to pay for the plans which have student plan equilevent because this makes the plan abusive and I feel as silly. That's why I avoid Google pro plan and we saw there how they messed up. ​",

The significant drop in token use should be attributed to a certain cause that I am trying to identify. Significant drop makes me wonder if cline and roo are becoming less popular or the traffic is being routed to a different provider.",

They'll hallucinate tool calls, forget parameters, or ignore tools entirely.\n\nTry a 30B+ model trained for tool use (Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B or DeepSeek Coder V2). The jump from 10B to 30B+ is a qualitative leap for tool use. If you're RAM-constrained, a 4-bit quantized 32B model runs in ~20GB VRAM and will still dramatically outperform a 10B at this.\n\nLet me know how it goes!",
