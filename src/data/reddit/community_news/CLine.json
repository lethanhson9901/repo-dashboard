Memory bank - so you don’t have to keep explaining your project context or programming guidelines for each new prompt.\n\n\n3. Running cost per task so you know how much you’ve spent on each feature you build. \n\n\n4. Because it’s a VSC extension I can use it with git so I can develop new features in separate branches and rollback if there is a problem. I can also see precisely which files have been changed and if something unexpected changes I can investigate.\n\n\n5. Can use with openrouter so I’m not stuck with one LLM (you can even change which LLM is used for plan vs act)",

It's way harder to stay in flow state when you have these pause and wait periods.\n\nI typically have 2 meaningful changes in-flight so while one agent is planning or implementing a PR in the background I'm reviewing a plan from another agent. When things are going well there's a back-and-forth rhythm between planning and reviewing and testing code. Two parallel features is the max that's still fun for me\n\nThis is actually basically the same problem manager or tech leads have had forever. You're responsible for a whole team's delivery and all you can do is provide feedback and wait.\n\nAlso I'm waiting for an agent to finish rn lol",
