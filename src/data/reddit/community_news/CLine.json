We're working on a full post mortem but want to address concerns now.\n\nWe traced the vulnerability to a GitHub Action that used AI to triage issues. It was susceptible to prompt injection, which was exploited to expose keys. Here's what we've done:\n\n\\- Removed the GitHub Action immediately\n\n\\- Rotated all affected keys\n\n\\- Confirmed no other releases were compromised\n\n\\- Disabled token-based publishing on NPM as an additional safeguard\n\nYou can read more about it on our GitHub advisory here: [https://github.com/cline/cline/security/advisories/GHSA-9ppg-jx86-fqw7](https://github.com/cline/cline/security/advisories/GHSA-9ppg-jx86-fqw7)\n\nUpdate: we have published a post-mortem on our blog with more information [https://cline.bot/blog/post-mortem-unauthorized-cline-cli-npm](https://cline.bot/blog/post-mortem-unauthorized-cline-cli-npm)",

What happened is unfortunate, but as we expose more systems to AI agents, we need to be extremely mindful of prompt injection and reducing the overall attack surface. It seems inevitable that attacks targeting AI agents will increase, so turning situations like this into learning opportunities would benefit the entire community.\nPersonally, I review skills manually before letting my AIs interact with them, but I’m not a cybersecurity professional, and I don’t have unlimited time to fully understand every way my surface area could be exploited. Even well-designed agentic systems can make mistakes and introduce vulnerabilities. I’m grateful this incident caused minimal damage, but raising awareness is likely the best outcome.\nI know you’ve lost some people to OpenAI, but even so, your company remains highly capable and positioned to play an important role in the future of AI and coding agents. It’s unrealistic to eliminate every possible attack vector—these systems operate continuously and can search for weaknesses around the clock. Moving forward, rapid patching through our own agentic systems will be essential. Building coding agents that can audit code and proactively identify risks feels like a critical direction for the field.\nThank you for taking ownership of the situation. Leadership accountability matters more than ever. When leaders prioritize safety—even at the cost of major opportunities—it sets a powerful example. The same goes for open-source contributors who push the ecosystem forward; their work shouldn’t be overlooked. I’m looking forward to seeing what you build next.",

      "text": "OpenAI made GPT-5.3-Codex generally available today. We added support for it in Cline 3.67.1, so you can select it and start using it right away without managing an API key.\n\n**What's different about this model:**\n\n- 25% faster than 5.2 Codex\n- 1st place on SWE-Bench Pro, which spans 4 languages (not just Python like SWE-Bench Verified)\n- Nearly 2x on OSWorld — 38% → 65%. This is end-to-end agentic task completion, so it maps pretty directly to the kind of multi-step, multi-file work you do in Cline\n- Fewer tokens per task than any prior OpenAI model\n\nThe speed and token efficiency improvements are the real wins here. Runs finish faster and cost less. The OSWorld jump is worth paying attention to if you care about how well the model handles longer, multi-step tasks rather than isolated completions.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\nSelect GPT-5.3-Codex from the model dropdown in Cline. No API key setup required.\n\nIf you try it out, would be curious to hear how it compares to whatever you're currently running, especially on larger repos or longer tasks where the agentic improvements should be most noticeable.\n\n- Juan 🫡\n",

However, once I switched to ACT mode to implement the changes, I was shocked to find actual costs hitting my dashboard despite Cline indicating it was \"free.\" \n\nCline needs to address these cost control issues immediately. If a model is only \"free\" under specific conditions (like Plan mode or a daily credit limit), Cline must show a clear warning before switching to a paid state.\n\nCline shouldn't allow a user to proceed with a \"free\" model if the underlying API is charging. At the very least, a \"Cost Warning\" threshold should be mandatory for all users to prevent these surprises\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hhont8i3hkg1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3c6f5c002462148e63f57546bb2eab4b8698616\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvggsldj3hkg1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=770c1bf8d88ba208efb44bbb8a46b47e558ace97\n\n  \n",

They show up under the \"Cline\" provider because that routes through our API which picks up new models faster. We're tracking this and have filed it as a bug: https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/9477. In the meantime, you can use them via the \"Cline\" provider. Thanks for flagging this! 🙏",

Gemini 3.1 is not available via the Google Provider in Cline.  \nI helped myself and replaced all Gemini 3.0 (gemini-3-pro-preview) references in extensions.js and assets.js with the new model id, so I can use it. But it should be made available without any workarounds. It is a drop-in replacement, so it should not be too hard to include (it is basically copy/paste). 3.1 works like a charm via Google.\n\nI also tried via OpenRouter where it is actually available but that gives me http 400 errors eventually.",
