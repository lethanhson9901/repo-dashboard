You might not get billions of users, but you're solving a problem and doing it with craft e.g. with your canvas idea. Excited for the future!",

          "text": "The idea is very interesting, and hopefully you can find product market fit for it.  I would assume the devil is in the details of which actions need to be sent to tools because the AI is prone to produce errors, and which do you let it handle directly with inference.  \n\nI would try to pick a more compelling example for your video though.  My guess is quickly creating an account and filtering to transactions containing 'Lowe' And batch tagging all the filtered transactions would actually be faster than what we witnessed or about the same.  \n\nI would try to come up with something that's much harder for a human to do with decent software to give a real 'wow' here.  I assume there's something around reconciling, or using the OCR to automate actual data entry that would point to a much greater time savings, especially since most people doing data entry are very aware of the volume of documents that they need to manually do data entry for. \n\nThe other major issue you might run into with something like this, is that your technical buyer is the person whose job is most threatened by your solution.  This creates all sorts of messed up incentives during your sales cycle. This is especially true if you're trying to penetrate an organization that has people whose job it is to do the bookkeeping and data entry.  \n\nI've seen this play out in a few different technical domains, but it's always the same story.  People's livelihoods are threatened, and they poke every hole in it they can to prove it's not going to work for their business as a result.  You have a sentence about how this is to help them start their work at a different point in the process, but they're all smart enough to know that if there are five of them and this starts doing the work of three of them, that only the two most essential (or cheapest depending on management culture) are still going to be needed.\n\nSo maybe this means marketing it to bootstrap businesses who don't have accountants and just want to save time?  The problem is you might end up with the blind (an LLM) leading the blind, a founder, not an accountant who is trained to spot it's errors.  This could create liability for you, or lack of trust in the solution and bad reviews at best if it happens.\n\nAnother avenue is to try to find the real lead of the accounting department and I have only them that the solution.  If they are incentivized to find efficiencies, and you're actually creating efficiencies for them, they're sometimes a path there.  Or if you have executive buy-in really driving the project from the top down, sometimes, that can be enough if the internal executive has really convinced folks that their jobs are safe.\n\nThere's finesse in working this out, and that person doesn't always exist or may want to protect the team, especially if they have a budget that's in some part dependent on how large the team is.\n\nThere's probably a niche you can target, I'm just calling these things out as hurdles to be aware of and start thinking hard about if you're not getting the traction you expected. \n\nGood Luck!",

Things like logs, metrics, google docs, jira,..\n\nSo things like /review-deployment which enables claude to check logs, metrics, kubernetes etc is pretty powerful to reduce manual monitoring on deployment.

If I feel and see that the context setup is wrong or the model is starting to make too many assumptions I start fresh.\n\nAgents seems a reach for now and the only model that could possibly do it I guess is Opus which is the model I use the most right now as well but I dont see how agents can actually be productive on anything other than the smallest stuff.\n\nFor reference I work on a 100k+ line repo with 10-12 dockerized services + monitoring etc.\n\nI guess the only question is if one can use the api key from CC in Cline and if you save anything from it?\n\nMonthly spend on tokens for me is like 600-1k USD.",

However, last night these \"Plan Created\" windows started showing up in the output, and they have massively decreased the usefulness of the tool in my workflow.\n\nI'm old-school, and prefer to thoroughly review all generated code and manually add it to the project. I can probably count on one hand the number of times I've used Cline in \"Act Mode\". I'm used to reviewing the source code listings generated by Cline in the old source code listing windows, which worked pretty well.\n\nThe \"Plan Created\" windows are small, and I have to scroll both horizontally and vertically to see everything in the output. Even worse, text is intermingled with the source code, so there's extra noise that I have to scroll through.\n\nI'm about to downgrade the VSCode plugin to see if that helps. However, even if it does, I suspect that my days on an outdated plugin will be numbered.\n\nI like Cline and I don't want to leave the platform. Is there a setting to re-enable the old source listing windows that I've missed? If not, then can we please get a setting for that?",
