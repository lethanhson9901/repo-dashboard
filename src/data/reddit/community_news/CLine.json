      "text": "**TL;DR:** Redesigned terminal UI, better support for running parallel agents, ACP integration for Zed/Neovim/Emacs, and free Kimi K2.5 access (and more to come…).\n\nHey r/Cline 👋.\n\nThe team has been working hard on Cline CLI over the past few weeks and we're happy to share some updates that should make the whole experience feel a lot more usable.\n\nHere’s what’s changing:\n\n# Next notch interactive experience within terminal \n\nWe rebuilt the CLI from the ground up to make it look and feel like the Cline you're used to in VS Code, making it easier to transition from the IDE to the terminal. Plan/Act modes, easy Auto-approve toggle, and powerful slash commands.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1quzieq/video/qqrycnawlbhg1/player\n\n# Improved parallel agents\n\nYou can spin up separate Cline instances across tmux panes or terminal tabs. One agent refactoring your DB layer while another updates docs on a different branch, all seamlessly happening with Cline CLIs. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1quzieq/video/tqrmcwptlbhg1/player\n\n# ACP support: use Cline in Zed, Neovim, and more\n\nCline now works with ACP-compatible editors through the[ cline-acp adapter](https://github.com/Tonksthebear/cline-acp). That means you can run Cline directly inside Zed, Neovim (via CodeCompanion or avante.nvim), Emacs, and any other editor that uses ACP.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1quzieq/video/j76zqrhulbhg1/player\n\n# Automate with headless pipelines\n\nCline CLI is fully scriptable. Use the -y flag to skip all permissions in autonomous CI/CD pipelines, pipe logs as stdin directly into the CLI, and use the --json flag to parse output easily.\n\nAutomate what makes sense. Stay in control of the rest.\n\n# Free Kimi K2.5 access (for a limited time!)\n\nWe added support for[ Kimi K2.5](https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html), Moonshot's open-source model. It's strong on agentic tasks and significantly cheaper than the big closed models, though Opus still edges it out on some pure coding benchmarks. The free access is temporary, so make the most of it while you can.\n\nMore on our launch here: [**https://cline.bot/blog/announcing-cline-cli-2-0**](https://cline.bot/blog/announcing-cline-cli-2-0)\n\nFor a limited time, we’re also making it possible for you to experiment for free with Kimi K2.5 one of the best open-source models available, Kimi K2.5.\n\nYour feedback is what lets us continue to deliver a great product for the open-source community. We’d love to hear from you.",

The issue is with the redirect. It was an issue i had a few months ago where i couldn't log into cline in vs code(insiders)(windows 11). I couldn't complete the auth., meaning i could log into the account in the browser(edge/chrome, it doesn't work for both), i completed the auth successfully, but the redirect is not redirecting, and the cline extension don't detect it. resulting in not being able to log into an account (i tried with 2 Google accounts, both failed). So i stopped using it, because i couldn't log in to use it. And didn't want to troubleshoot this. A FEW MONTHS AGO.\n\nSaw the release post about Cline CLI 2.0 and the free Kimmy, and i decided to enable the extension and see what changed, but i couldn't, because of the exact same blocking issue i had  a few months ago. So again i can't use the extension....\n\nI would love for it to be fixed so i can try you out and be impressed, because usually i was disappointed with major releases because of some blocking bug or some reliability issues and stopped using it because of that.",

And you can specify different setting for each instance. e.g. if you wanted to run cline with a cheap model and then pipe that output into cline running on a more expensive model, it would be very easy to do with a command line program. I'm excited to use this for CI/CD applications personally",

They'll hallucinate tool calls, forget parameters, or ignore tools entirely.\n\nTry a 30B+ model trained for tool use (Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B or DeepSeek Coder V2). The jump from 10B to 30B+ is a qualitative leap for tool use. If you're RAM-constrained, a 4-bit quantized 32B model runs in ~20GB VRAM and will still dramatically outperform a 10B at this.\n\nLet me know how it goes!",

For instance, I have a filesystem tool that I love, but it'll try to browse things outside of the allowed folder tree often, get an error and have to correct. I wish it knew better on the first shot.",
