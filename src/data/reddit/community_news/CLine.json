I tried opencode, claude code, kilo, roo, vs code github copilot with openAi extension, zed, cline everything to make it working and worthy.  \nEveryone failed but only Cline is the champion. Second is Copilot.  \nCopilot is good for debugging, small tasks, planning etc. but not for full stack development with GLM 4.7.  \nZed is also good, but stuck on long tasks. And eats your quota fast.  \nBut with Cline, I can create complete full stacks apps in Laravel, Vue etc. No problem at all.  \nWasted so much tiem with many IDEs and CLIs.  \nITs so compatible. So good. It makes my subscription worth and I now subscibed to yearly plan for [Z.Ai](http://Z.Ai)\n\nGLM itself is so good, its like Claude Sonnet 4.5 but with no image support. I wish [Z.Ai](http://Z.Ai) release GLM 4.7v and I wish Cline add GLM 4.7 Flash support.  <3\n\n  \nThanks Cline team for making such a good software. Its so underrated.  \nAnyone looking for perfect way to use GLM, try Cline. You will thank me.",

          "text": "The idea is very interesting, and hopefully you can find product market fit for it.  I would assume the devil is in the details of which actions need to be sent to tools because the AI is prone to produce errors, and which do you let it handle directly with inference.  \n\nI would try to pick a more compelling example for your video though.  My guess is quickly creating an account and filtering to transactions containing 'Lowe' And batch tagging all the filtered transactions would actually be faster than what we witnessed or about the same.  \n\nI would try to come up with something that's much harder for a human to do with decent software to give a real 'wow' here.  I assume there's something around reconciling, or using the OCR to automate actual data entry that would point to a much greater time savings, especially since most people doing data entry are very aware of the volume of documents that they need to manually do data entry for. \n\nThe other major issue you might run into with something like this, is that your technical buyer is the person whose job is most threatened by your solution.  This creates all sorts of messed up incentives during your sales cycle. This is especially true if you're trying to penetrate an organization that has people whose job it is to do the bookkeeping and data entry.  \n\nI've seen this play out in a few different technical domains, but it's always the same story.  People's livelihoods are threatened, and they poke every hole in it they can to prove it's not going to work for their business as a result.  You have a sentence about how this is to help them start their work at a different point in the process, but they're all smart enough to know that if there are five of them and this starts doing the work of three of them, that only the two most essential (or cheapest depending on management culture) are still going to be needed.\n\nSo maybe this means marketing it to bootstrap businesses who don't have accountants and just want to save time?  The problem is you might end up with the blind (an LLM) leading the blind, a founder, not an accountant who is trained to spot it's errors.  This could create liability for you, or lack of trust in the solution and bad reviews at best if it happens.\n\nAnother avenue is to try to find the real lead of the accounting department and I have only them that the solution.  If they are incentivized to find efficiencies, and you're actually creating efficiencies for them, they're sometimes a path there.  Or if you have executive buy-in really driving the project from the top down, sometimes, that can be enough if the internal executive has really convinced folks that their jobs are safe.\n\nThere's finesse in working this out, and that person doesn't always exist or may want to protect the team, especially if they have a budget that's in some part dependent on how large the team is.\n\nThere's probably a niche you can target, I'm just calling these things out as hurdles to be aware of and start thinking hard about if you're not getting the traction you expected. \n\nGood Luck!",

If I feel and see that the context setup is wrong or the model is starting to make too many assumptions I start fresh.\n\nAgents seems a reach for now and the only model that could possibly do it I guess is Opus which is the model I use the most right now as well but I dont see how agents can actually be productive on anything other than the smallest stuff.\n\nFor reference I work on a 100k+ line repo with 10-12 dockerized services + monitoring etc.\n\nI guess the only question is if one can use the api key from CC in Cline and if you save anything from it?\n\nMonthly spend on tokens for me is like 600-1k USD.",

Let Cline use terminal commands to do most of the parsing on the computer before sending state/summary info to the LLM, encouraging Cline to specifically not try to parse large amounts of command output and instead be smart about how it uses commands in the terminal to get the details that the LLM needs to make smart decisions.  I do this.  In my Cline Rules I also encourage Cline to combine read-only terminal commands to reduce the number of round trips when getting repo state, exploring a repo, truncating long output from commands/tests/etc.  I've found this to be particularly effective with the cline:openai/gpt-5.2 model; it's amazing at reducing cost.\n\nI'd be interested to know whether others do something similar.",

Are there any differences on speed of generation or is it only the quota that you get.\n\n  \nHappy to use it with Cline, but love to know how are things in different plans.",

      "text": "My company purchased Cline licenses several months ago, and I've been using it via the VSCode plugin extensively since then. However, last night these \"Plan Created\" windows started showing up in the output, and they have massively decreased the usefulness of the tool in my workflow.\n\nI'm old-school, and prefer to thoroughly review all generated code and manually add it to the project. I can probably count on one hand the number of times I've used Cline in \"Act Mode\". I'm used to reviewing the source code listings generated by Cline in the old source code listing windows, which worked pretty well.\n\nThe \"Plan Created\" windows are small, and I have to scroll both horizontally and vertically to see everything in the output. Even worse, text is intermingled with the source code, so there's extra noise that I have to scroll through.\n\nI'm about to downgrade the VSCode plugin to see if that helps. However, even if it does, I suspect that my days on an outdated plugin will be numbered.\n\nI like Cline and I don't want to leave the platform. Is there a setting to re-enable the old source listing windows that I've missed? If not, then can we please get a setting for that?",
