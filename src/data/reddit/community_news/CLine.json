      "text": "Hey everyone, 3.47.0 just dropped. Here are some changes we've been working on:\n\n**Background Edits**\n\nThis came directly from community feedback. A lot of you mentioned wanting to keep coding while Cline works, instead of having it steal your cursor every time it opens a diff view. [Background Edits](https://docs.cline.bot/features/background-edit) fixes that. Cline can now edit files without opening the diff view or taking over your cursor. You stay in your file, Cline works in the background. \n\nTo enable it: Settings > Feature Settings > Background Edits\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1q5zkkc/video/vgwdi0fqgtbg1/player\n\nCurious to hear how it works for your workflow. This is experimental so let us know if you run into any issues.\n\n**MiniMax M2.1 is free through Thursday**\n\nWe updated our free model list and added MiniMax M2.1. Better multilingual coding support across Rust, Go, Java, C++, TypeScript. It's open source and competitive with top closed source models on coding benchmarks. Free tier runs through Thursday, January 9th at 7pm PST.\n\n**Other fixes**\n\n* FixedAzure identity auth for OpenAI Compatible provider and Azure OpenAI. \n* Fixed expired token handling.\n* Fixed Cerebras rate limiting, \n* Fixed Remote MCP server 404s.\n* Fixed Auto Compact for Claude Code provider. \n* Fixed Native tool calling for Deepseek 3.2\n* Fixed the Baseten model selector\n\nFull changelog in our [blog](https://cline.bot/blog/cline-3-47-0-adds-background-edits-and-a-free-minimax-2-1).\n\nUpdate your extension to get these changes. Let us know if you have questions.",

      "text": "Just shipped 3.48.0 with two notable additions:\n\n**Skills compatibility**\n\nIf you've built Skills, you can now use them in Cline. Skills are modular instruction sets that load on-demand. The key difference from rules (which are always active): Cline only sees the skill name and description until it actually needs the full instructions. You can have dozens of skills without affecting context or performance.\n\nEach skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and detailed instructions. Skills can live globally in `~/.cline/skills/` (applies to all projects) or locally in `.cline/skills/` within your workspace.\n\nSome ideas: release management workflows, code review checklists, database migration procedures, API integration patterns, debugging workflows for specific frameworks. The best skills encode institutional knowledge that usually lives only in senior devs' heads.\n\nTo enable: Settings → Features → Enable Skills. You'll find a new Skills tab in the rules and workflows panel.\n\nFull docs: https://docs.cline.bot/features/skills\n\n**Websearch tooling**\n\nCline provider users now have access to websearch and web fetch tools. These let Cline search the web and retrieve page content directly as text.\n\nIf you've used the browser tool before, you know it works by launching headless Chrome, taking screenshots, and interpreting what it sees visually. That's useful for debugging your own apps or interacting with web interfaces. But when Cline just needs to look something up, launching a browser and parsing screenshots is slow and context-heavy.\n\nThe new websearch tools solve this. When Cline needs to check latest docs, look up an API reference, or find current information, it can search and fetch that content as clean text. No browser launch, no screenshots, no visual interpretation overhead. Faster lookups, less context consumption.\n\nThis pairs well with Skills: Skills give Cline domain expertise you've codified; websearch gives Cline access to information that changes over time.\n\nTo use websearch, you need to be on the Cline provider with credits in your account. The tools are available automatically when Cline determines it needs external information.\n\n**Other improvements**\n\nGemini thinking support, Katcoder added to model list, zai-glm-4.7 on Cerebras, Vercel AI Gateway model refresh and improved reasoning support. Also fixed a regression from 3.47.0 that affected diff view and document truncation.\n\nFull writeup in our [blog](https://cline.bot/blog/cline-3-48-0-skills-and-websearch-make-cline-smarter)",

GLM coding plan within it is insanely good news for anyone coding for cheap. also - it doesn't overload the context with useless 'tooling' and basically it doesn't flood the context window with stuff & fluff but it actually works instead. \n\ncline, kilo realized way too late that the real game is not the IDE extension, but actually CLI - as CLI tools are what majority of coders / vibecoders will use and be familiar with. And also a few flaws, eg. broken tool calls using some LLMs (or just spamming with tool calls which doesn't work great with prompt based subscriptions etc.) are not great.\n\nYeah, im not a fan of cline and it's successors at all, but it's for a - solid - reason. and claude code actually, for past few months is **imo the strongest and most capable AI coding harness itself** (no matter what model r u using, within claude code it'll perform the best, potentially).",

I kept resisting the switch to Claude Code and then Cline hit that wall with something i considered relatively simple.  It could not embed GHL forms into my website and i ran up a $300-400 tab on OpenRouter in about 3 days using every model available to no avail.  So i said to hell with it and went through install process for Claude Code and it literally fixed this embed issue within 10-15 minutes and i was hooked.  However, I’m not using it in stand alone terminals.  I use it inside VScode in a WSL terminal so i can see files and it feels like a better experience to me.  I also run Codex 5.2 via the extension beside it.  Codex is a total bad ass when it comes to code reviews and making enhancement suggestions and i found it to be a bit better at UI design.  My workflow is to take the awesome overly optimistic (lying) summaries from CC and paste them into Codex for verification and enhancement suggestions and then i give that back to CC.  This saves me a boat load of time on testing and it improves the code.  I did try Codex as the primary coder but it failed at that.  Code reviewer and CC lie detector is its strong suit.  I also love spinning up multiple subagents in CC and let it run.  Mind blowing how much it can get done very quickly.  Bottom line is the $200 max plan per month is a bargain vs OpenRouter token usage, especially with the capabilities gap between Cline and CC.",

This led me to discover Cline, an open-source tool that has been a game-changer for my workflow.\n\nCline's primary appeal was its seamless integration into VS Code, which was a significant advantage over paid alternatives like Cursor. The fact that it's free, open-source, and comes with a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server made the decision easy. Its active GitHub repository also inspires confidence.\n\nMy exploration into \"vibe coding\" has given me a newfound appreciation for open-source software, and Cline embodies this perfectly. It has empowered me to not only set up servers with ease but also to understand and contribute to the projects I use. I was able to connect [Z.AI](http://Z.AI) in minutes.\n\nSeveral of Cline's features stand out. The \"plan and execute\" toggle provides excellent control over the AI's process, and the custom rules system is remarkably effective when the AI follows them. I am particularly excited about the upcoming \"hooks\" functionality. For instance, I've configured a rule where, upon completing a task, Cline triggers a simple Python script. This script converts the completion message to audio, so I receive an audible notification instead of having to monitor the screen constantly.\n\nWhile I pay $10 through Cline to use Anthropic's models for their superior planning capabilities, the combination of Cline and [Z.AI](http://Z.AI) is incredibly powerful. With the flexibility of the MCP server, the possibilities seem vast. I'm already looking forward to managing multiple Cline instances using an agent harness with a pre-defined set of rules. **So if any of the developers that work on Cline are watching I just want to say thank you!**",

And right now I have a long list in Cline that are disabled and I can see how it's going to be unmanageable soon. And I wouldn't mind running multiple agents because that means if they're slow, it's fine. It gives me a time to orchestrate between multiple different agents.

It's similar to how Anthropic has Claude Max (consumer subscription) and Claude API (developer API with separate billing). Google doesn't automatically grant API access just because you have a consumer subscription.\n\nGoogle's free tier API has anti-abuse measures that require a payment method on file, even if you never actually get charged. The 429 \"Resource Exhausted\" error you're seeing isn't really about quota, it's about account verification status. Accounts without payment methods are treated as higher-risk and get much more aggressive rate limiting, regardless of actual usage.\n\nWhen you used Antigravity (which likely uses a different Google API internally), it probably triggered a review flag on your account. Google then moved your API access into a more restricted tier. Adding the payment method to your API billing validates your account and removes those restrictions.",

It honestly felt like it had swapped to a weaker model behind the scenes.\n\nI switched over to the **Claude Code CLI** to test the same prompt—back to being butter smooth. Same request, perfect result.\n\nIs anyone else noticing Cline \"having its days,\" or is the system prompt starting to feel bloated compared to the official CLI?",

Be verbose in verification.  Point out potential problems.  Let the user ask for suggestions as follow ups unless the fix is small and minimal. \n2. If a specific kind of file is changed then check this file adheres to the specified pattern of X.  Here I reference another .md file that defines the pattern. It kind of lazy loads this documentation. \n\n\nI generally prefer the first round of feedback to be potential problems and a wide net rather than having concise responses that make my brain have low activity.  I want to use my brain, and would prefer skimming too much info rather than having too little info and not critically thinking. \n\nIf there’s enough interest, I can share my prompt in a gist.
