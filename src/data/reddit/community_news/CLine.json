      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nAnother week and another set of new features and fixes. Here is what's new in Cline:\n\n**Native Subagents (experimental)**\n\nThe big one. Cline can now spin up parallel sub-tasks that run independently with their own context. Currently subagents can read files, search codebases, and use skills, so you can have multiple agents exploring your project at the same time instead of going one task at a time. Available in VSCode and the CLI.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1r2mnwv/video/xmmf7lseh0jg1/player\n\n**GLM-5 support**\n\nZAI's new flagship model (744B params, 40B active) is now available in Cline. It's built for coding and agentic workflows, uses DeepSeek Sparse Attention for efficient long-context handling, and a new async RL infrastructure called Slime for better post-training. Best-in-class among open-source models on reasoning, coding, and agentic benchmarks. Expected MIT license release\n\n**Hands-off task completion**\n\n* Auto-approval for `attempt_completion` so tasks can finish without you approving every step\n* Double-check completion (experimental) adds a verification step before completing, so you get autonomy with a safety net\n* YOLO mode now auto-approves MCP tools too\n\n**CLI improvements**\n\n* `--thinking` flag accepts a custom token budget\n* `--max-consecutive-mistakes` stops tasks before they spiral\n* More shortcuts in help output\n\n**Provider & enterprise**\n\n* Amazon Bedrock parallel tool calling\n* Opus 4.6 with 1M context on Vertex and Claude Code providers\n* MCP server management improvements (synced deletion, header support)\n* Remote config UI with test buttons\n* Bundled endpoints.json for offline support\n\n**Fixes**\n\nTerminal commands now surface exit codes, tuned timeout strategy for long-running tasks, reasoning behavior parity restored, CI environment support for headless runs, OAuth callback fixes, input text persists on remount, and a bunch more.\n\nFull changelog: [https://github.com/cline/cline/releases/tag/v3.58.0](https://github.com/cline/cline/releases/tag/v3.58.0)",
