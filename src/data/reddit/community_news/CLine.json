      "text": "Hey Everyone!\n\nAnthropic just released Sonnet 4.6 and it's available in Cline now. Update to v3.64.0 to access it. It's free to use in Cline until Feb 18 at noon PST, so you can try it without any commitment.\n\n**Early impressions from our team:**\n\nSpeed is noticeably better. The model gives you good context on what it's working on as it goes, which sounds minor but makes a big difference when you're running longer tasks.\n\nLibrary usage is impressive. It's pulling in the right libraries and actually integrating them into your project cleanly, not just importing something and half-using it.\n\nSubagents are where it really clicked. Fast, precise, and at *Sonnet-tier* pricing it makes parallelizing work with subagents way more practical.\n\n**What Anthropic is reporting:**\n\n* \\~70% of devs preferred Sonnet 4.6 over 4.5 in Claude Code testing\n* 59% preferred it over Opus 4.5\n* Less overengineering, fewer hallucinations, better follow-through on multi-step tasks\n* 1M token context window (entire codebases in a single request)\n\nAfter the free period, pricing stays the same as Sonnet 4.5 ($3/$15 per MTok).\n\n**One more thing:** We're looking for volunteers for a usability interview on the CLI and subagents. It's a quick study and we're offering $50 USD in credits for anyone who participates. Schedule a call here: [https://calendar.app.google/91ReAvjDkHa3VVBw8](https://calendar.app.google/91ReAvjDkHa3VVBw8)\n\nWould love to hear what you all think after trying it.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6c4rneuat4kg1.gif",

      "text": "Hey everyone, just pushed v8.2 of the Cline Recursive Chain-of-Thought System (CRCT).\n\nThe major focus of this update is moving away from expensive API calls for dependency mapping. We've integrated local LLM support (via GGUF/llama-cpp) to handle the heavy lifting of resolving placeholders and verifying file relationships.\n\nKey Highlights in v8.2:\n\n- 🤖 Local LLM Automation: Use local models (like Qwen3-4B) to batch-resolve unverified dependencies ('p') at zero cost.\n- 🧠 Dual-Token Tracking: We now track both Symbol Essence (SES) and Raw tokens separately, allowing Cline to fit much more 'meaning' into the context window without truncation.\n- 🚀 Cascade Cache Invalidation: Smarter analysis consistency—when a core file changes, the system knows exactly which logical dependencies need re-verification.\nThis version also includes the v8.1 performance overhaul (atomic batch writes and lookup caching) to keep things snappy even in massive codebases.\n\n```\n# Cline Recursive Chain-of-Thought System (CRCT) - v8.2\n\nWelcome to the **Cline Recursive Chain-of-Thought System (CRCT)**, a framework designed to manage context, dependencies, and tasks in large-scale Cline projects within VS Code. Built for the Cline extension, CRCT leverages a recursive, file-based approach with a modular dependency tracking system to maintain project state and efficiency as complexity increases.\n\n- Version **v8.2**: 🤖 **LOCAL LLM & DUAL-TOKEN EMBEDDINGS** - Automated Resolution & Precise Context\n    - **Automated Placeholder Resolution**: New `resolve-placeholders` command uses local LLMs (via `llama-cpp-python`) to verify 'p' dependencies in batches, significantly reducing manual verification time and API costs.\n    - **Dual-Token Schema**: Refactored metadata to track both `ses_tokens` (for embeddings) and `full_tokens` (for total file size), enabling smarter context window management.\n    - **Enhanced Documentation Parsing**: Specialized SES extraction for structured docs, improving semantic search for requirements and design specs.\n    - **Dependency-Aware Cache**: Cache invalidation now cascades through logical file dependencies, ensuring analysis consistency.\n- Version **v8.1**: ⚡ **PERFORMANCE & STABILITY** - Batching and Caching Overhaul\n    - **Tracker Batch Collection**: New `TrackerBatchCollector` system for atomic, high-performance tracker writes with rollback support.\n    - **Advanced Caching**: Enhanced `@cached` decorator with dynamic file dependencies (`file_deps`), mtime-based invalidation, and automated path tracking.\n    - **Optimized I/O**: Refactored `tracker_io` with local lookup caching to eliminate redundant file parsing during updates.\n    - **Report Filtering**: `report_generator` now supports `EXCLUSION_PATTERNS` to eliminate false positives and groups multiple occurrences for cleaner analysis.\n    - **Windows Path Consistency**: Standardized on Uppercase drive letters for improved compatibility across different Python environments.\n- Version **v8.0**: 🚀 **MAJOR RELEASE** - Embedding & analysis system overhaul\n    - **Symbol Essence Strings (SES)**: Revolutionary embedding architecture combining runtime + AST metadata for 10x better accuracy\n    - **Qwen3 Reranker**: AI-powered semantic dependency scoring with automatic model download\n    - **Hardware-Adaptive Models**: Automatically selects between GGUF (Qwen3-4B) and SentenceTransformer based on available resources\n    - **Runtime Symbol Inspection**: Deep metadata extraction from live Python modules (types, inheritance, decorators)\n    - **PhaseTracker UX**: Real-time progress bars with ETA for all long-running operations\n    - **Enhanced Analysis**: Advanced call filtering, deduplication, internal/external detection\n    - **Breaking Changes**: `set_char` deprecated, `exceptions.py` removed, new dependencies (`llama-cpp-python`), requires re-run of `analyze-project`. See [MIGRATION_v7.x_to_v8.0.md](MIGRATION_v7.x_to_v8.0.md)\n- Version **v7.90**: Introduces dependency visualization, overhauls the Strategy phase for iterative roadmap planning, and refines Hierarchical Design Token Architecture (HDTA) templates.\n    - **Dependency Visualization (`visualize-dependencies`)**:\n        - Added a new command to generate Mermaid diagrams visualizing project dependencies.\n        - Supports project overview, module-focused (internal + interface), and multi-key focused views.\n        - Auto-generates overview and module diagrams during `analyze-project` (configurable).\n        - Diagrams saved by default to `<memory_dir>/dependency_diagrams/`.\n        - **NEW** integrated mermaid-cli to render dependency diagrams as .svg files. (experimental stage, subject to change in rendering process)\n            - Performs well under 1000 edges to render, struggles with more than 1500 edges. Will reliably time-out with large 4000+ edge diagrams.\n            - Requires additional dependency installation, should work via `npm install`\n    - **Dependency Analysis and Suggestions**\n        - Enhanced with python AST (for python)\n        - Enhanced with tree-sitter (for .js, .ts, .tsx, .html, .css)\n        - More to come!\n    - **Strategy Phase Overhaul (`strategy_plugin.md`):**\n        - Replaced monolithic planning with an **iterative, area-based workflow** focused on minimal context loading, making it more robust for LLM execution.\n        - Clarified primary objective as **hierarchical project roadmap construction and maintenance** using HDTA.\n        - Integrated instructions for leveraging dependency diagrams (auto-generated or on-demand) to aid analysis.\n        - Refined state management (`.clinerules` vs. `activeContext.md`).\n        - Split into Dispatch and Worker prompts to take advantage of new_task\n    - **HDTA Template Updates**:\n        - Reworked `implementation_plan_template.md` for objective/feature focus.\n        - Added clarifying instructions to `module_template.md` and `task_template.md`.\n        - Created new `roadmap_summary_template.md` for unified cycle plans.\n- Version **v7.7**: Restructured core prompt/plugins, introduced `cleanup_consolidation_plugin.md` phase (use with caution due to file operations), added `hdta_review_progress` and `hierarchical_task_checklist` templates.\n- Version **v7.5**: Significant baseline restructuring, establishing core architecture, Contextual Keys (`KeyInfo`), Hierarchical Dependency Aggregation, enhanced `show-dependencies`, configurable embedding device, file exclusion patterns, improved caching & batch processing.\n\n---\n\n## System Requirements\n\n### Recommended (v8.0+)\n- **VRAM**: 8GB+ (NVIDIA GPU) for optimal Qwen3-4B model performance\n- **RAM**: 16GB+ for large projects\n- **Disk**: 8GB+ for models and embeddings\n- **Python**: 3.8+\n- **Node.js**: 16+ (for mermaid-cli visualization)\n\n### Minimum\n- **RAM**: 4GB (CPU-only mode with reduced batch sizes)\n- **Disk**: 500MB+ (lightweight models)\n- **Python**: 3.8+\n\n*The system automatically adapts to available hardware.*\n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Recursive Decomposition**: Breaks tasks into manageable subtasks, organized via directories and files for isolated context management.\n- **Minimal Context Loading**: Loads only essential data, expanding via dependency trackers as needed.\n- **Persistent State**: Uses the VS Code file system to store context, instructions, outputs, and dependencies. State integrity is rigorously maintained via a **Mandatory Update Protocol (MUP)** applied after actions and periodically during operation.\n- **Modular Dependency System**: Fully modularized dependency tracking system.\n- **Contextual Keys**: Introduces `KeyInfo` for context-rich keys, enabling more accurate and hierarchical dependency tracking.\n- **Hierarchical Dependency Aggregation**: Implements hierarchical rollup and foreign dependency aggregation for the main tracker, providing a more comprehensive view of project dependencies.\n- **Enhanced Dependency Workflow**: A refined workflow simplifies dependency management.\n    - `show-keys` identifies keys needing attention ('p', 's', 'S') within a specific tracker.\n    - `show-dependencies` aggregates dependency details (inbound/outbound, paths) from *all* trackers for a specific key, eliminating manual tracker deciphering.\n    - `add-dependency` resolves placeholder ('p') or suggested ('s', 'S') relationships identified via this process. **Crucially, when targeting a mini-tracker (`*_module.md`), `add-dependency` now allows specifying a `--target-key` that doesn't exist locally, provided the target key is valid globally (known from `analyze-project`). The system automatically adds the foreign key definition and updates the grid, enabling manual linking to external dependencies.**\n      *   **Tip:** This is especially useful for manually linking relevant documentation files (e.g., requirements, design specs, API descriptions) to code files within a mini-tracker, even if the code file is incomplete or doesn't trigger an automatic suggestion. This provides the LLM with crucial context during code generation or modification tasks, guiding it towards the intended functionality described in the documentation (`doc_key < code_key`).\n    - `resolve-placeholders`: **(NEW in v8.2)** Automates the verification of unverified dependencies ('p') using a local LLM. This makes the resolution process significantly more efficient and less costly than using larger API-based models.\n      *   Example: `python -m cline_utils.dependency_system.dependency_processor resolve-placeholders --tracker <path_to_tracker.md>`\n    - `determine-dependency`: **(NEW in v8.2)** Performs a detailed local LLM analysis between two specific keys to verify their relationship with full reasoning.\n      *   Example: `python -m cline_utils.dependency_system.dependency_processor determine-dependency --source-key <key> --target-key <key>`\n   - **Dependency Visualization (`visualize-dependencies`)**: **(NEW in v7.8)**\n    - Generates Mermaid diagrams for project overview, module scope (internal + interface), or specific key focus.\n    - Auto-generates overview/module diagrams via `analyze-project`.\n    - **NEW in v7.90** Now generates .svg image files for diagram visualization if the mermaid-cli dependency is installed.\n- **Iterative Strategy Phase**: **(NEW in v7.8)**\n    - Plans the project roadmap iteratively, focusing on one area (module/feature) at a time.\n    - Explicitly integrates dependency analysis (textual + visual) into planning.\n- **Refined HDTA Templates**: **(NEW in v7.8)**\n    - Improved templates for Implementation Plans, Modules, and Tasks.\n    - New template for Roadmap Summaries.\n- **Configurable Embedding Device**: Allows users to configure the embedding device (`cpu`, `cuda`, `mps`) via `.clinerules.config.json` for optimized performance on different hardware. (Note: *the system does not yet install the requirements for cuda or mps automatically, please install the requirements manually or with the help of the LLM.*)\n- **File Exclusion Patterns**: Users can now define file exclusion patterns in `.clinerules.config.json` to customize project analysis.\n- **Code Quality Analysis**: **(NEW in v8.0, Improved in v8.1)**\n    - **Report Generator**: A tool (`report_generator.py`) that performs AST-based code quality analysis.\n    - **Incomplete Code Detection**: Identifies `TODO`, `FIXME`, empty functions/classes, and `pass` statements using robust Tree-sitter parsing.\n    - **False Positive Filtering**: **(NEW in v8.1)** Added `EXCLUSION_PATTERNS` to filter out common false positives like `sql.Placeholder`.\n    - **Condensed Reporting**: **(NEW in v8.1)** Groups multiple occurrences of the same issue in a file for more readable reports.\n    - **Unused Item Detection**: Integrates with Pyright to report unused variables, imports, and functions.\n- **Advanced Caching and Batching**: **(MAJOR UPDATE in v8.1)**\n    - **Tracker Batching**: Collects all tracker updates in memory and writes them in a single operation, significantly reducing disk I/O.\n    - **Atomic Updates**: Features rollback support to maintain tracker integrity if a batch write fails.\n    - **Intelligent Invalidation**: Caches now automatically invalidate based on file modification times (mtime) and specific path arguments.\n- **Modular Dependency Tracking**:\n    - Utilizes main trackers (`module_relationship_tracker.md`, `doc_tracker.md`) and module-specific mini-trackers (`{module_name}_module.md`).\n    - Mini-tracker files also serve as the HDTA Domain Module documentation for their respective modules.\n    - Employs hierarchical keys and RLE compression for efficiency.\n- **Automated Operations**: System operations are now largely automated and condensed into single commands, streamlining workflows and reducing manual command execution.\n- **Phase-Based Workflow**: Operates in distinct phases: Set-up/Maintenance -> Strategy -> Execution -> Cleanup/Consolidation, controlled by `.clinerules`.\n- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Ensures transparency with step-by-step reasoning and reflection.\n\n---\n\n## Quickstart\n\n1. **Clone the Repo**:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/RPG-fan/Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-.git\n   cd Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   npm install  # For mermaid-cli visualization\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Up Cline or RooCode Extension**:\n   - Open the project in VS Code with the Cline or RooCode extension installed.\n   - Copy `cline_docs/prompts/core_prompt(put this in Custom Instructions).md` into the Cline Custom Instructions field. (new process to be updated)\n\n4. **Start the System**:\n   - Type `Start.` in the Cline input to initialize the system.\n   - The LLM will bootstrap from `.clinerules`, creating missing files and guiding you through setup if needed.\n\n*Note*: The Cline extension's LLM automates most commands and updates to `cline_docs/`. Minimal user intervention is required (in theory!)\n\n---\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nCline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/\n│   .clinerules/\n│   .clinerules.config.json       # Configuration for dependency system\n│   .gitignore\n│   CHANGELOG.md                  # Version history <NEW in v8.0>\n│   INSTRUCTIONS.md\n│   LICENSE\n│   MIGRATION_v7.x_to_v8.0.md     # Upgrade guide <NEW in v8.0>\n│   README.md\n│   requirements.txt\n│\n├───cline_docs/                   # Operational memory\n│   │  activeContext.md           # Current state and priorities\n│   │  changelog.md               # Logs significant changes\n│   │  userProfile.md             # User profile and preferences\n│   │  progress.md                # High-level project checklist\n│   │\n│   ├──backups/                   # Backups of tracker files\n│   ├──dependency_diagrams/       # Default location for auto-generated Mermaid diagrams <NEW>\n│   ├──prompts/                   # System prompts and plugins\n│   │    core_prompt.md           # Core system instructions\n|   |    cleanup_consolidation_plugin.md <NEWer>\n│   │    execution_plugin.md\n│   │    setup_maintenance_plugin.md\n│   │    strategy_plugin.md         <REVISED>\n│   ├──templates/                 # Templates for HDTA documents\n│   │    hdta_review_progress_template.md <NEWer>\n│   │    hierarchical_task_checklist_template.md <NEWer>\n│   │    implementation_plan_template.md <REVISED>\n│   │    module_template.md         <Minor Update>\n│   │    roadmap_summary_template.md  <NEW>\n│   │    system_manifest_template.md\n│   │    task_template.md           <Minor Update>\n│\n├───cline_utils/                  # Utility scripts\n│   └─dependency_system/\n│     │ dependency_processor.py   # Dependency management script <REVISED>\n│     ├──analysis/                # Analysis modules <MAJOR UPDATES in v8.0>\n│     │    dependency_analyzer.py   <2x growth>\n│     │    dependency_suggester.py  <1.9x growth>\n│     │    embedding_manager.py     <3.4x growth>\n│     │    project_analyzer.py      <1.7x growth>\n│     │    reranker_history_tracker.py <NEW>\n│     │    runtime_inspector.py     <NEW>\n│     ├──core/                    # Core modules <REVISED key_manager.py>\n│     │    exceptions_enhanced.py  <NEW - replaces exceptions.py>\n│     ├──io/                      # IO modules\n│     └──utils/                   # Utility modules\n│          batch_processor.py      <Enhanced with PhaseTracker>\n│          cache_manager.py        <2x growth - compression, policies>\n│          config_manager.py       <2x growth - extensive new config>\n│          phase_tracker.py        <NEW - progress bars>\n│          resource_validator.py   <NEW - system checks>\n│          symbol_map_merger.py    <NEW - runtime+AST merge>\n│          tracker_batch_collector.py <NEW in v8.1 - batch I/O>\n│          visualize_dependencies.py <NEW>\n│\n├───docs/                         # Project documentation\n├───models/                       # AI models (auto-downloaded) <NEW>\n└───src/                          # Source code root\n\n```\n*(Added/Updated relevant files/dirs)*\n\n---\n\n## Current Status & Future Plans\n\n- **v8.2**: 🤖 **Local LLM & Dual-Tokens** - Automated resolution of dependency placeholders and precise token-based context management.\n- **v8.1**: ⚡ **Performance Optimization** - Introduced batch tracker updates and advanced caching mechanisms to handle larger projects with lower I/O overhead.\n- **v8.0**: 🚀 **Major architecture evolution** - Symbol Essence Strings, Qwen3 reranker, hardware-adaptive models, runtime symbol inspection, enhanced UX with PhaseTracker.

The extra API calls you saw with Kilo Code are one reason I switched away from it too — transparency matters when you're paying per token.\n\nOne tip if you haven't already: set up a monthly spending cap in your OpenRouter dashboard. It's easy to lose track when you're in flow and the API is just... working.\n\nAlso worth experimenting with different models for different tasks. Codex is great for complex reasoning, but for simple things like formatting, renaming, or boilerplate, a cheaper model (Gemini Flash, GPT-4o-mini) gives identical results at 10-20x lower cost. You can switch models per conversation in Cline pretty easily.",

However, once I switched to ACT mode to implement the changes, I was shocked to find actual costs hitting my dashboard despite Cline indicating it was \"free.\" \n\nCline needs to address these cost control issues immediately. If a model is only \"free\" under specific conditions (like Plan mode or a daily credit limit), Cline must show a clear warning before switching to a paid state.\n\nCline shouldn't allow a user to proceed with a \"free\" model if the underlying API is charging. At the very least, a \"Cost Warning\" threshold should be mandatory for all users to prevent these surprises\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hhont8i3hkg1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3c6f5c002462148e63f57546bb2eab4b8698616\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvggsldj3hkg1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=770c1bf8d88ba208efb44bbb8a46b47e558ace97\n\n  \n",

My colleagues are getting it as well all the time.  \nWhen Cline tries to create a big file (like a concept document or a larger code file) it produces this infamous: \"Cline tried to use write\\_to\\_file without value for required parameter 'content'. Retrying...\" error. Which happens 3 times and the chat stops.  \n  \nI always need to instruct the LLM: \"This environment is not able to produce large files. Create the file in iterations (but ONE file)\" which usually works. So because this work-around exists it is \"just\" annoying and no show-stopper. But still. I really wish this was fixed.  \n  \nI am using Claude models. Opus mostly. But it also happens with Sonnet.\n\nDoes anyone else experience the same problem?",

What's happening is that when you ask Cline to write a large file, the model's output gets truncated mid-response before it finishes writing the file content — so the content parameter arrives empty. The old error message just said \"retry with complete response,\" which the model interpreted literally and retried identically, looping until it gave up.\n\nThe fix gives the model a much more useful error: it explains why the content was empty (output token limits / context pressure), shows how full the context window is, and gives concrete alternative strategies — write a skeleton first, then fill it in with replace\\_in\\_file, or break the file into smaller pieces. On the second and third failures it escalates to stronger directives so the model actually changes its approach instead of looping.\n\nIt'll be in the next release. In the meantime, your workaround of asking Cline to create the file in iterations is exactly the right instinct. The fix just makes Cline figure that out on its own.\n\n  \nWe're also experimenting with a companion change (https://github.com/cline/cline/pull/9366) that adds proactive guidance directly to the write\\_to\\_file tool description — so the model knows the skeleton strategy before it even attempts a large write, rather than only learning about it after the first failure.\n\n",
