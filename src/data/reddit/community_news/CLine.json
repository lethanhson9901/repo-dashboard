I tried opencode, claude code, kilo, roo, vs code github copilot with openAi extension, zed, cline everything to make it working and worthy.  \nEveryone failed but only Cline is the champion. Second is Copilot.  \nCopilot is good for debugging, small tasks, planning etc. but not for full stack development with GLM 4.7.  \nZed is also good, but stuck on long tasks. And eats your quota fast.  \nBut with Cline, I can create complete full stacks apps in Laravel, Vue etc. No problem at all.  \nWasted so much tiem with many IDEs and CLIs.  \nITs so compatible. So good. It makes my subscription worth and I now subscibed to yearly plan for [Z.Ai](http://Z.Ai)\n\nGLM itself is so good, its like Claude Sonnet 4.5 but with no image support. I wish [Z.Ai](http://Z.Ai) release GLM 4.7v and I wish Cline add GLM 4.7 Flash support.  <3\n\n  \nThanks Cline team for making such a good software. Its so underrated.  \nAnyone looking for perfect way to use GLM, try Cline. You will thank me.",

Let Cline use terminal commands to do most of the parsing on the computer before sending state/summary info to the LLM, encouraging Cline to specifically not try to parse large amounts of command output and instead be smart about how it uses commands in the terminal to get the details that the LLM needs to make smart decisions.  I do this.  In my Cline Rules I also encourage Cline to combine read-only terminal commands to reduce the number of round trips when getting repo state, exploring a repo, truncating long output from commands/tests/etc.  I've found this to be particularly effective with the cline:openai/gpt-5.2 model; it's amazing at reducing cost.\n\nI'd be interested to know whether others do something similar.",

For example, \"build xyz\" and then \"assess xyz to see what you can improve about it\" and then \"simplify the code\" and then \"code review it\", etc.?  Do you have a better example than this?",

      "text": "I have successfully used Cline’s memory-bank in a single-project repository, primarily to preserve context across multiple Cline tasks in a large codebase. In practice, when I notice the LLM context window approaching its token limit, I ask Cline to “update memory bank,” then start a new task and instruct it to “follow your custom instructions,” allowing work to resume from where it previously stopped.\n\nHowever, I am unclear on the best way to apply memory-bank in a monorepo setup. Our repository is structured as follows:\n\n    mono-repo\n      - serviceA\n      - serviceB\n      - serviceZ\n    \n\nMultiple teams will be working on different services concurrently.\n\n**Question 1:**  \nIn this scenario, what is the recommended memory-bank structure?\n\nOption A — a centralized memory-bank at the repo root, partitioned by service:\n\n    mono-repo\n      - serviceA\n      - serviceB\n      - serviceZ\n      - memory-bank\n          - serviceA\n              - projectBrief.md\n              - techContext.md\n          - serviceB\n              - projectBrief.md\n              - techContext.md\n    \n\nOption B — a dedicated memory-bank within each service:\n\n    mono-repo\n      - serviceA\n          - memory-bank\n              - projectBrief.md\n              - techContext.md\n      - serviceB\n          - memory-bank\n              - projectBrief.md\n              - techContext.md\n      - serviceZ\n          - memory-bank\n              - projectBrief.md\n              - techContext.md\n    \n\n**Question 2:**  \nOnce a task is complete, should all memory-bank markdown files be committed? My understanding is that files such as [`activeContext.md`](http://activeContext.md) and [`progress.md`](http://progress.md) are task-specific and primarily used to track in-flight work, so I do not see a strong reason to commit them after task completion.\n\n**Question 3:**  \nIf we implement multiple features on the same service (e.g., `feature1`, `feature2` on `serviceA`), is the expectation that memory-bank will continuously evolve? Specifically, should files like [`projectBrief.md`](http://projectBrief.md) and [`productContext.md`](http://productContext.md) be incrementally updated after each completed task to reflect the current state of the service?\n\n",

I'd love to set different models for each instance. Sometimes, I'm multitasking a personal project in which I don't want to use an employer's API key.\n\n3. Sometimes there are issues when one window is asking for execution permission, it tends to make the other window unable to ask. \n\nSo, generally, it works, but there are caveats I'm hoping someday to resolve.",

Just stops there, never finishes to the point where it asks me to save or reject. I don't know what to do anymore (not that I even knew what to do). I'm tired of pressing cancel and then telling cline try again. Which makes it start the edit all over again. This is so frustrating when it's editing a long file. It's irritating regardless. Happens with creating new files too. Cancelling deletes the file and so I start again. \n\nI don't know if it's the model: claude sonnet 4-5. I thought it was when the task got to the point I see I've been charged about $35 which means the task is long running but now it's happening at $15. I don't know if this is a memory thing. I don't even have as many chrome tabs open this go around. \n\nEdit: botched title. I meant does this happen for anyone else",
