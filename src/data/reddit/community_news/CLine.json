      "text": "OpenAI made GPT-5.3-Codex generally available today. We added support for it in Cline 3.67.1, so you can select it and start using it right away without managing an API key.\n\n**What's different about this model:**\n\n- 25% faster than 5.2 Codex\n- 1st place on SWE-Bench Pro, which spans 4 languages (not just Python like SWE-Bench Verified)\n- Nearly 2x on OSWorld — 38% → 65%. This is end-to-end agentic task completion, so it maps pretty directly to the kind of multi-step, multi-file work you do in Cline\n- Fewer tokens per task than any prior OpenAI model\n\nThe speed and token efficiency improvements are the real wins here. Runs finish faster and cost less. The OSWorld jump is worth paying attention to if you care about how well the model handles longer, multi-step tasks rather than isolated completions.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\nSelect GPT-5.3-Codex from the model dropdown in Cline. No API key setup required.\n\nIf you try it out, would be curious to hear how it compares to whatever you're currently running, especially on larger repos or longer tasks where the agentic improvements should be most noticeable.\n\n- Juan 🫡\n",

      "text": "I have a feature request that would drastically improve my QoL and I think others might agree.\n\nLet us save and favorite certain model selections and settings so we can switch between them pretty easily. \n\nFor example, I use OpenRouter and Nano-GPT (OpenAI Compatible) as well as a few other providers. What I'd like is to be able to set up favorites such that I can quickly and easily choose between:\nNano-GPT/GLM\nNano-GPT/Gemini\nNano-GPT/Kimi\nOpenRouter/Claude Sonnet\nOpenAI/ChatGPT\n\nThis would allow me to quickly switch to a cheaper model for personal projects and doc review, then switch to an expensive model when I need to deep-dive or one-shot a problem. \n\nI'd also really like to see it be able to spawn sub-agents using non-Anthropic models. I don't think I've seen it do that, but I suspect GLM and Kimi would play well in that environment. Bonus points if I can use a cheaper model for simple agentic tasks like parsing files and save the expensive models for coding and planning.\n",

Do not summarize - return every line\"\n\nor\n\n\"Read these files in the working directory \\`blabla\\` and provide their COMPLETE contents:\n\n1. \\`src/file1\\`\n\n2. \\`src/file2\\`\n\n3. \\`src/file3\\`\"\n\nWhich results often in something like: \"the output was truncated. I need to read the files by myself\". This first attempt by using sub-agents wastes a huge amount of tokens for basically nothing.\n\nI fixed this behaviour somehow by adding a global rule:  \n\"do NOT use sub-agents to simply read a file for getting its content. Use your tools for reading files and not sub-agents\".\n\nThe prompt should be improved, sure. But it gets the job done most of the time.  \nMaybe you should give the sub-agents a prompt extension so that sub-agents are not used anymore for simple files-reads.",

Make a new folder and create a spec.md. Clone the respective repos that I want it to touch.\n\n2. Make various comments around the code to give clues to the agent.\n\n3. Enter plan mode, have it make a plan and verification step for each repo\n\n4. I review / revise the plan. Then go into act mode.\n\nCurious about what you think about monorepo vs multi.",
