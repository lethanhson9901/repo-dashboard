      "text": "Anthropic released Opus 4.6 today and it's available in Cline now in v3.57.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qx158e/video/w86hipj2frhg1/player\n\n**TLDR**\n\nThis is Anthropic's most capable model. Big improvements in reasoning, long context handling, and agentic tasks. If you've been using Opus 4.5 for complex work, this is a straight upgrade.\n\n**Benchmarks**\n\n* 80.8% on SWE-Bench Verified\n* 65.4% on Terminal-Bench 2.0 (state of the art)\n* 68.8% on ARC-AGI-2 (up from 37.6% on Opus 4.5)\n* 1M token context window\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2oey9305frhg1.png?width=2002&format=png&auto=webp&s=052b7167a430731d196e885b232b735c9892015d\n\nTwo things stood out to me reading the system card:\n\n1. **It doesn't lose the plot.** 1M token context window and it actually uses it well. If you've ever had a model forget what you told it three prompts ago, you'll feel the difference here. The long context recall is significantly better than previous models. You can throw an entire codebase at it and it keeps track.\n2. **It infers intent better.** You don't have to be as precise with your prompts. It's better at figuring out what you actually want even when you're being vague. Less babysitting, more just saying what you need.\n\n**When to use it**\n\nOpus 4.6 is the model for hard tasks. Complex refactors, multi-file changes, debugging something weird, anything where you need the model to hold a lot of context and think carefully.\n\nFor quick everyday stuff, Sonnet is still faster and cheaper.\n\n**How to use it**\n\nSelect claude-opus-4-6 from the model picker. Works with your Anthropic API key.\n\nWorks in your terminal, JetBrains, VS Code, Zed, Neovim, and Emacs.\n\nCurious to hear how it works for you all. What are you throwing at it?",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI’ve been using **Cline** pretty consistently since around **December 2025** for a business startup I’m working on, and I wanted to sanity-check how others are handling **context and memory management**.\n\nMy setup so far:\n\n* I have a **ChatGPT Plus** subscription and mostly use ChatGPT in the browser as the *“brain”*:\n   * documenting decisions\n   * defining tasks\n   * refining prompts\n* Then I use **Cline** to actually *execute* the work (coding, refactors, changes, etc).\n* From early on, I had **Cline rules** in place (mainly guardrails around Python dev and workflow discipline).\n* I’ve also tried to be very deliberate about **documentation** as I go.\n\nOne thing I noticed pretty quickly was that my **context window was huge** — often **200k+ tokens**, even just kicking off fairly simple prompts. At the time, I only really had:\n\n* a basic `.clinerules` folder\n* no `.clineignore`\n* no structured memory management beyond “keep docs in the repo”\n\nRecently I started digging more seriously into **context optimisation and memory banks**.\n\nWhat I’ve done since:\n\n* Adapted the **basic memory bank concept** from the official Cline docs\n* Added a `.clineignore` (which I’d completely ignored before 😅)\n* Tightened what actually needs to load into context vs what can live “cold”\n\nThat alone dropped my starting context to about **40,000 tokens**, which I’m honestly very happy with. It’s made a *huge* difference:\n\n* I can use **smaller, cheaper models**\n* Faster iteration\n* Less accidental context pollution\n\nThat said, I’ve noticed:\n\n* Some users have built **much more advanced rule sets** that are deployable by using their repo first and dropping your project files into the src folder\n* Others talk about **recursive chain of though** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1iscdag/cline\\_recursive\\_chainofthought\\_system\\_crct/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1iscdag/cline_recursive_chainofthought_system_crct/)\n* And at the far end, there are **RAG-based approaches** (vector DBs, separate servers indexing the whole repo, etc.). Examples include Memento CLI and ByteRover 2.0\n\nSo I’m curious:\n\n1. **What are people actually using in practice right now?**\n   * Simple memory banks?\n   * Heavier rule-driven approaches?\n   * Full RAG setups?\n2. **Where’s the trade-off point** where complexity stops being worth it?\n3. **Does Cline have anything on the roadmap** around:\n   * first-class memory management\n   * smarter context loading\n   * or better tooling inside the extension itself?\n\nRight now, the memory bank + ignore approach feels like a good balance for me, but I’d love to hear what’s working (or not working) for others.\n\nDisclaimer: I used AI to help me write this, because I don't know all the fancy terms.

Using ChatGpt for governance of your MDs is risky because it generates too much documentation and reduces agility. Use ChatGpt with extreme caution. Regarding the other point, define your agents per project. If it's a RAG, I recommend Antropy. Never a cheap solution. Like Z.ai, code always includes annotations, and technical documentation is vital. Don't let Cline make decisions; it tends to generate duplicate functions, and you won't be able to defend your code to a mining IT team, for example.\n\nWhat I'm telling you is based on my own experience.\nMy recommendation is to avoid Claude.",

I don't think I've seen any model get it right on the first try as often as this one. I did catch some logical mistakes in the planning process, but that's to be expected. I just tell it, \"No, that doesn't do what you think it does...\" and it adjusts and pushes out clean code. Way Cool.",
