We're working on a full post mortem but want to address concerns now.\n\nWe traced the vulnerability to a GitHub Action that used AI to triage issues. It was susceptible to prompt injection, which was exploited to expose keys. Here's what we've done:\n\n\\- Removed the GitHub Action immediately\n\n\\- Rotated all affected keys\n\n\\- Confirmed no other releases were compromised\n\n\\- Disabled token-based publishing on NPM as an additional safeguard\n\nYou can read more about it on our GitHub advisory here: [https://github.com/cline/cline/security/advisories/GHSA-9ppg-jx86-fqw7](https://github.com/cline/cline/security/advisories/GHSA-9ppg-jx86-fqw7)",

              "text": "Could you create a YouTube video that breaks down the lessons learned so other developers don’t repeat the same mistake? What happened is unfortunate, but as we expose more systems to AI agents, we need to be extremely mindful of prompt injection and reducing the overall attack surface. It seems inevitable that attacks targeting AI agents will increase, so turning situations like this into learning opportunities would benefit the entire community.\nPersonally, I review skills manually before letting my AIs interact with them, but I’m not a cybersecurity professional, and I don’t have unlimited time to fully understand every way my surface area could be exploited. Even well-designed agentic systems can make mistakes and introduce vulnerabilities. I’m grateful this incident caused minimal damage, but raising awareness is likely the best outcome.\nI know you’ve lost some people to OpenAI, but even so, your company remains highly capable and positioned to play an important role in the future of AI and coding agents. It’s unrealistic to eliminate every possible attack vector—these systems operate continuously and can search for weaknesses around the clock. Moving forward, rapid patching through our own agentic systems will be essential. Building coding agents that can audit code and proactively identify risks feels like a critical direction for the field.\nThank you for taking ownership of the situation. Leadership accountability matters more than ever. When leaders prioritize safety—even at the cost of major opportunities—it sets a powerful example. The same goes for open-source contributors who push the ecosystem forward; their work shouldn’t be overlooked. I’m looking forward to seeing what you build next.",

      "text": "Hey Everyone!\n\nAnthropic just released Sonnet 4.6 and it's available in Cline now. Update to v3.64.0 to access it. It's free to use in Cline until Feb 18 at noon PST, so you can try it without any commitment.\n\n**Early impressions from our team:**\n\nSpeed is noticeably better. The model gives you good context on what it's working on as it goes, which sounds minor but makes a big difference when you're running longer tasks.\n\nLibrary usage is impressive. It's pulling in the right libraries and actually integrating them into your project cleanly, not just importing something and half-using it.\n\nSubagents are where it really clicked. Fast, precise, and at *Sonnet-tier* pricing it makes parallelizing work with subagents way more practical.\n\n**What Anthropic is reporting:**\n\n* \\~70% of devs preferred Sonnet 4.6 over 4.5 in Claude Code testing\n* 59% preferred it over Opus 4.5\n* Less overengineering, fewer hallucinations, better follow-through on multi-step tasks\n* 1M token context window (entire codebases in a single request)\n\nAfter the free period, pricing stays the same as Sonnet 4.5 ($3/$15 per MTok).\n\n**One more thing:** We're looking for volunteers for a usability interview on the CLI and subagents. It's a quick study and we're offering $50 USD in credits for anyone who participates. Schedule a call here: [https://calendar.app.google/91ReAvjDkHa3VVBw8](https://calendar.app.google/91ReAvjDkHa3VVBw8)\n\nWould love to hear what you all think after trying it.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6c4rneuat4kg1.gif",

It very often uses a prompts like:  \n  \n\"Read the file \\`blabla\\` in the working directory \\`blabla\\` and provide the COMPLETE content of the file. Do not summarize - return every line\"\n\nor\n\n\"Read these files in the working directory \\`blabla\\` and provide their COMPLETE contents:\n\n1. \\`src/file1\\`\n\n2. \\`src/file2\\`\n\n3. \\`src/file3\\`\"\n\nWhich results often in something like: \"the output was truncated. I need to read the files by myself\". This first attempt by using sub-agents wastes a huge amount of tokens for basically nothing.\n\nI fixed this behaviour somehow by adding a global rule:  \n\"do NOT use sub-agents to simply read a file for getting its content. Use your tools for reading files and not sub-agents\".\n\nThe prompt should be improved, sure. But it gets the job done most of the time.  \nMaybe you should give the sub-agents a prompt extension so that sub-agents are not used anymore for simple files-reads.",

The extra API calls you saw with Kilo Code are one reason I switched away from it too — transparency matters when you're paying per token.\n\nOne tip if you haven't already: set up a monthly spending cap in your OpenRouter dashboard. It's easy to lose track when you're in flow and the API is just... working.\n\nAlso worth experimenting with different models for different tasks. Codex is great for complex reasoning, but for simple things like formatting, renaming, or boilerplate, a cheaper model (Gemini Flash, GPT-4o-mini) gives identical results at 10-20x lower cost. You can switch models per conversation in Cline pretty easily.",

      "text": "I’ve been testing the new Claude Sonnet 4.6 in Cline. I started in PLAN mode, and my balance remained untouched, leading me to believe the session was under a free tier. However, once I switched to ACT mode to implement the changes, I was shocked to find actual costs hitting my dashboard despite Cline indicating it was \"free.\" \n\nCline needs to address these cost control issues immediately. If a model is only \"free\" under specific conditions (like Plan mode or a daily credit limit), Cline must show a clear warning before switching to a paid state.\n\nCline shouldn't allow a user to proceed with a \"free\" model if the underlying API is charging. At the very least, a \"Cost Warning\" threshold should be mandatory for all users to prevent these surprises\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hhont8i3hkg1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3c6f5c002462148e63f57546bb2eab4b8698616\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvggsldj3hkg1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=770c1bf8d88ba208efb44bbb8a46b47e558ace97\n\n  \n",

My colleagues are getting it as well all the time.  \nWhen Cline tries to create a big file (like a concept document or a larger code file) it produces this infamous: \"Cline tried to use write\\_to\\_file without value for required parameter 'content'. Retrying...\" error. Which happens 3 times and the chat stops.  \n  \nI always need to instruct the LLM: \"This environment is not able to produce large files. Create the file in iterations (but ONE file)\" which usually works. So because this work-around exists it is \"just\" annoying and no show-stopper. But still. I really wish this was fixed.  \n  \nI am using Claude models. Opus mostly. But it also happens with Sonnet.\n\nDoes anyone else experience the same problem?",

What's happening is that when you ask Cline to write a large file, the model's output gets truncated mid-response before it finishes writing the file content — so the content parameter arrives empty. The old error message just said \"retry with complete response,\" which the model interpreted literally and retried identically, looping until it gave up.\n\nThe fix gives the model a much more useful error: it explains why the content was empty (output token limits / context pressure), shows how full the context window is, and gives concrete alternative strategies — write a skeleton first, then fill it in with replace\\_in\\_file, or break the file into smaller pieces. On the second and third failures it escalates to stronger directives so the model actually changes its approach instead of looping.\n\nIt'll be in the next release. In the meantime, your workaround of asking Cline to create the file in iterations is exactly the right instinct. The fix just makes Cline figure that out on its own.\n\n  \nWe're also experimenting with a companion change (https://github.com/cline/cline/pull/9366) that adds proactive guidance directly to the write\\_to\\_file tool description — so the model knows the skeleton strategy before it even attempts a large write, rather than only learning about it after the first failure.\n\n",
