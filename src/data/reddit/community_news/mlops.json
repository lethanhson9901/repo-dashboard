      "text": "Something I've noticed after being in this space for a while, and mentioned in past weeks' posts as well.\n\nMLOps roles need strong infrastructure skills. Everyone agrees on that. The job descriptions are full of Kubernetes, CI/CD, cloud, distributed systems, monitoring, etc.\n\nBut the people interviewing you? Mostly data scientists, ML engineers, and PhD researchers.\n\nSo you end up in a strange situation where the job requires you to be good at production engineering, but the interview asks you to speak ML. And these are two very different conversations.\n\nI've seen really solid DevOps engineers, people running massive clusters, handling serious scale, get passed over because they couldn't explain what model drift is or why you'd choose one evaluation metric over another. Not because they couldn't learn it, but because they didn't realise that's what the interview would test.\n\nAnd on the flip side, I've seen ML folks get hired into MLOps roles and MAY struggle because they've never dealt with real production systems at scale.\n\nThe root cause I think is that most companies are still early in their ML maturity. They haven't separated MLOps as its own discipline yet. The ML team owns hiring for it, so naturally, they filter for what they understand: ML knowledge, not infra expertise.\n\nThis isn't a complaint, just an observation. And practically speaking, if you're coming from the infra/DevOps side, it means you kinda have to meet them where they are. Learn enough ML to hold the conversation. You don't need to derive backpropagation on a whiteboard, but you should be able to talk about the model lifecycle, failure modes, why monitoring ML systems is different from monitoring regular services, etc.\n\nThe good news is the bar isn't that high. A few weeks of genuine study go a long way. And once you bridge that language gap, your infrastructure background becomes a massive advantage, because most ML teams are honestly struggling with production engineering.\n\nCurious if others have experienced this same thing? Either as candidates or on the hiring side?\n\nI've also helped a few folks navigate this transition, review their resumes, prepare for interviews, and figure out what to focus on.

They don't seem to grasp that transition from DevOps to MLOps is perhaps just a few weekends of study as these people don't need low level details/maths. They will not be implementing KServe, Dynamo, vLLM, Tensor-RT, they will be deploying these solutions and monitoring them.\n\nFor a data scientist, MLOps will not be interesting and they will likely leave.",

The physical infrastructure to do that is just a necessary evil you have to deal with. The actual skills are related to understanding all the assumptions being made in the model and the data to make sure that that the performance at inference time matches performance at train time. \n\nThis involves a ton of work on how data is collected for the training process and then debugging at inference time to determine if the model is performing as intended and dig through all the layers of the stack to figure out why it may not be performing correctly. \n\nYou can have a perfectly good model trained on great data that is undeployable because the inference process has slightly different consistency guarantees from the offline training data. MLops is the final stop on the make it all work train.

And not just because you need a knowledge of DS (though you definitely do). The fact is, ML applications are different than plain Software applications, and there are some specific software skillsets that need to be applied to effectively serve ML.\n\nOn my last project, I was the bridge between a DS team and a Platform team. We had extreme troubles, because the Platform team didn't understand how serving an ML model is different than serving a normal API. For example, the ML artifacts we needed (or the size of them). They were really upset that we wanted to put a large model file in our deployment, but also told us we shouldn't need a volume mount - LOL. How else you gonna serve a model? I have dozens of examples like this. But also, in order to serve my DS' models, I need some understanding of how it works. I don't need the nitty gritty, but I need a solid working knowledge. How I pipeline and retrain a supervised vs unsupervised model is different. How I evaluate the model for drift depends on the algorithm.\n\nMy boss also once was short on MLOps engineers so he had to borrow some DevOps engineers. He said that two of them couldn't do what one engineer from our team can. Not because they weren't skilled - but because the lack of context for what they were engineering was a huge part.",

          "text": "What different teams are hiring for will depend on where that team is in terms of the maturity of its ML system as you rightly say OP. If they are at low levels of maturity, it is as you say often teams of scientists who are hiring and they will often just look for an engineer who can scale up and automate a lot of what they have been crafting - that means at interview they will want an engineer that talks their language and shows that they understand them. If the hiring org is mature, they have employed a system / platform that clearly dictates the engineering skills that need to be brought in.\n\nEvery business and even within a large business, the level of maturity varies dramatically. My advice to applicants looking for roles is to find the role that matches your skills and experience given that the responsibilities are so varied from company to company for the same job title. If you are looking to learn, a firm that is mature is the easiest way to understand scale but if you want a challenge, want to shape something that could be exciting, take a chance on a firm that doesn’t know what it wants if you think you can really help, you like their culture and the remuneration is agreeable. It could still be the happiest place you’ve ever worked (and some of the most fun data scientists I have ever worked with were the most clueless at what was needed outside of their IDE to make it all work).\n\nThat said…. If you aren’t able to explain concepts like model drift then you are unable to explain a key metric that helps determine the end of a model’s lifecycle (by monitoring its declining quality and kicking off a new build of the model). It is still never going to be the same as a DevOps or platform engineer and there will have to be language learnt that is employed by the data scientists if the engineers have not been/worked closely with data scientists previously.",

      "text": "In my last post, I discussed the importance of ML foundations and Python as key aspects of MLOps. But I realised I left out the other side of the coin, one that's equally valid and may be a better fit for many of you.\n\nIf math and stats aren't your thing and you dread memorising gradient descent variants or probability distributions, hear me out: there's a whole side of MLOps where that's not the focus.\n\nThis side focuses on **model serving, inference optimisation, and production scaling**. \n\nCompanies need people who can:\n\n* Expose models via FastAPI\n* Optimise inference latency and throughput using vLLM, TensorRT, or Triton\n* Manage serving infrastructure with KServe, Seldon, or Ray Serve\n* Handle autoscaling, batching strategies, A/B deployments, and canary rollouts\n* Build observability, monitoring drift, tracking latency p99s, and managing GPU utilisation\n\nNone of this requires you to derive backpropagation from scratch. What it *does* require is strong production engineering instincts, the kind you already have if you've been in DevOps, SRE, or platform engineering.\n\nSo if you're coming from an infrastructure background and feel overwhelmed trying to learn ML theory just to break into MLOps, know that there's a legit path that maps directly to your existing skills. Inference at scale is genuinely hard engineering, and most ML teams desperately need people who can do it well.\n\nThe ML foundations will come naturally over time through exposure. You don't need to master them before you start contributing meaningfully.\n\nI've also helped a few folks navigate this transition, review their resumes, prepare for interviews, and figure out what to focus on.

But you still need ops, because you are still shipping a probabilistic system whose behavior changes when any of these move: model endpoint, prompt/tooling, retrieval data, embeddings, index parameters, and guardrails.\n\nHow I usually frame it:\n\n1. Dedicated MLOps role?\n\n* Early stage: usually no. It is a backend or platform engineer plus a data engineer wearing an “LLM platform” hat.\n* You want a dedicated role when you have multiple teams shipping LLM features, regulated data, strict uptime, or you are doing frequent prompt and retrieval changes that need disciplined releases.\n\n1. Is it “just software engineering + data pipelines”?\n\n* Mostly yes, but with extra failure modes: non-determinism, silent quality regressions, prompt injection, data leakage, vendor model updates, and evaluation that is not a simple unit test.\n* So, the missing piece is not GPU infra, it is evaluation, observability, and safety controls designed for LLM behavior.\n\n1. What does “Ops” look like in API + RAG land?\n\n* Data and retrieval ops: ingestion, parsing, chunking, embedding generation, reindexing, backfills, access control, and index versioning/rollbacks.\n* Release management: prompt and config versioning, model version pinning, canary releases, fallbacks (smaller model, “no answer” mode), and feature flags.\n* Evals: a regression suite with golden queries, retrieval quality checks (did we fetch the right docs), answer quality checks, and red team cases. Run it in CI before merges and continuously in production.\n* Observability: tracing across app → retriever → model call, token and latency budgets, cost tracking, citation coverage, refusal rates, and user feedback loops.\n* Security and compliance: prompt injection defenses, tool permissioning, PII filtering, and audit logs.\n\nSo yes, you still “need MLOps,” but it is closer to SRE + data engineering + QA for an LLM system. If you are choosing what to learn, prioritize: evaluation harnesses, observability, data/retrieval pipelines, and safe rollout patterns. Learn the heavy GPU stuff when you have a clear reason to own training or serving.\n\nI hope this helps! :)",

There are many, many kinds of ML algorithms in the industry - recommendation and ranking (search, suggestions), forecasting, etc. It's not getting the same kind of hype, but those models are definitely not black box APIs and occasionally actually require a lot of work to connect with the data properly, feature engineering, etc.\n\n2. Even in GenAI, Ops of some sort is often required for anything more than a pretty simple setup. It might end up being devops, but you need things like guardrails, rate limiting, and secure handling of API keys, not to mention appropriate data pipelining, in order to actually have these things return business value. And a lot of ML still involved in things like handling tokens efficiently, etc. So maybe this role isn't 'traditional' MLOps, but the use-case is certainly there. Maybe it's called \"AI engineering\". but it's certainly not that far off from trad MLOps, if a little different.\n\nIn my opinion, learning heavy infra  is one of the more valuable skills these days. Anyone can build now. Getting something scalable and secure into production? That is definitely a more secure skillset, even if the title shifts a bit.",

      "text": "I work on security research at Gen Threat Labs, and we recently wrapped up an analysis of autonomous AI agents in production that I wanted to share. Specifically focused on OpenClaw given its popularity (165k GitHub stars and growing fast).\n\nQuick caveat upfront: our methodology has limitations. We scanned for exposed instances and analyzed publicly available community skills, but we don't have visibility into properly secured deployments or private enterprise setups. We also couldn't verify intent behind everything we flagged, so some of what we classified as malicious might just be poorly written code with bad patterns. Take the numbers with that context.\n\nThat said, what we found was worse than I expected going in.\n\nWe identified over 18,000 OpenClaw instances exposed directly to the internet. Not behind VPNs, not containerized, just sitting on default port 18789 accepting connections. One instance we found had full access to the user's email, calendar, and file system. Just... open. That one stuck with me because it's exactly the kind of setup that makes agents useful, and exactly what makes them dangerous.\n\nBut the finding that actually surprised me was in the community skill ecosystem. We analyzed hundreds of skills that users build and share, and nearly 15% contained what I'd classify as malicious instructions. Some were designed to download external payloads, others to exfiltrate data. A few had hidden logic that only triggered after repeated uses, which made them harder to catch in initial review.\n\nWe spent a while trying to use static analysis to catch these automatically, but the false positive rate was brutal. Ended up needing a mix of pattern matching and actually running skills in sandboxed environments to see what they do. Still not perfect.\n\nWe also noticed something frustrating: malicious skills that got flagged and removed would reappear under different names within days. Same payload, new identity. Whack a mole.\n\nThe attack pattern we kept seeing is what I've started calling \"Delegated Compromise.\" Instead of targeting the user directly, adversaries target the agent. Once they get in through prompt injection or a poisoned skill, they inherit every permission that user granted. It's honestly elegant from an attacker's perspective.\n\nTo OpenClaw's credit, their docs are transparent about this. They literally describe it as a \"Faustian bargain\" and acknowledge no perfectly safe setup exists. I respect that honesty, but I don't think most users deploying these agents fully internalize what that means.\n\nThe risk vectors we kept categorizing:\n\n• Expanded attack surface from agents with read/write/execute across multiple applications • Prompt injection through messages and web content with hidden instructions • Supply chain risk from community skills built without security review • System level impact when broadly permissioned agents get compromised • What I've been calling \"judgment hallucination\" where agents appear trustworthy but lack genuine reasoning, so users over delegate\n\nIf you're running agents in production, the practical stuff that actually matters:\n\n• Isolated environments (VMs or containers), not your primary machine • Don't expose default ports to public internet (seems obvious but 18,000 instances say otherwise) • Start read only, expand permissions incrementally • Secondary accounts during testing • Actually review activity logs, not just set and forget • Treat third party skills like installing unknown software, because that's basically what it is\n\nThe detection stuff we built for catching the hidden logic patterns, we've been calling it Agent Trust Hub internally. Happy to compare notes if anyone's working on similar approaches or has found better ways to handle the false positive problem.\n\nCurious how other teams are approaching this. Is agent security getting dedicated attention in your org, or is it still lumped in with general appsec? Trying to get a sense of whether this is becoming a recognized problem or if we're early to the panic.",

That's nightmare fuel without audit trails. User runs skill 5 times safely, 6th execution exfiltrates data. Post-incident question: what did it access across all 6 runs? Most deployments can't answer without forensics.\n\n\"Judgment hallucination\" + over-delegation compounds when you can't verify agent decisions. User trusts agent with email access, agent gets compromised, attacker inherits permissions. Without signed traces of every action (what was accessed, what policy should have blocked it, when it happened), incident response is archaeology. Security gaps plus evidence gaps means compromise detection happens weeks late.",

      "text": "As an MLOps Dev, I've stood up enough ML platforms to know the drill: VPC, EKS with GPU node pools, a dozen addons, an abstraction layer like Airflow, multi-tenancy, and maybe repeat it all in another region. The stack was usually Terraform, AWS Client VPN, Kubeflow or Airflow, and an external IdP like Okta.\n\nEvery time I'd finish, the same thought would creep up: \"If I started from scratch with fewer constraints, what would I actually pick?\"\n\nI finally worked through that question and open-sourced the result: \n\n**link**: [https://github.com/Roulbac/pulumi-eks-ml](https://github.com/Roulbac/pulumi-eks-ml)\n\n**The repo**\n\nIt's a Python library (named `pulumi-eks-ml`) of composable Pulumi components: VPC, EKS cluster, GPU node pools with Karpenter, networking topologies, etc. You import what you need and wire up your own topology rather than forking a monolithic template. The repo includes three reference architectures that go from simple to complex:\n\n- **Starter** : single VPC, single EKS cluster, recommended addons. Basically a \"hello world\" for ML on EKS.\n\n- **Multi-Region** : full-mesh VPC peering across regions, each with its own cluster. Useful if you need compute close to data in different geographies.\n\n- **SkyPilot Multi-Tenant** : the main one. Hub-and-spoke network, multi-region EKS clusters, a SkyPilot API server in the hub, isolated data planes (namespaces + IRSA) per team, Cognito auth, and Tailscale for VPN access.\n\n**Why SkyPilot?**\n\nI looked at a few options for the \"ML platform layer\" on top of Kubernetes and kept coming back to SkyPilot. It's fully open-source (no vendor lock beyond your cloud provider), it has a clean API server mode that supports workspaces with RBAC out of the box, and it handles the annoying parts of submitting jobs/services to Kubernetes, GPU scheduling, spot instance preemption, etc. It was a natural fit for a multi-tenant setup where you want different teams to have isolated environments but still share the underlying compute. It's not the only option, but for a reference architecture like this, its flexibility made it nice to build around.\n\n**Why Pulumi over Terraform?**\n\nHonestly, this mostly comes down to the fact that writing actual Python is nicer than HCL when your infrastructure has real logic in it. When you're looping over regions, conditionally peering VPCs, creating dynamic numbers of namespaces per cluster based on config, that stuff gets painful in Terraform. Pulumi lets you use normal language constructs, real classes, type hints, tests with pytest. The component model also maps well to building a library that others import, which is harder to do cleanly with Terraform modules. It's not that Terraform can't do this, it's just that the ergonomics of \"infrastructure as an actual library\" fit Pulumi better.\n\n**Why Tailscale?**\n\nThe whole network is designed around private subnets, no public endpoint for the SkyPilot API. You need some way to reach things, and Tailscale makes that trivially easy. You deploy a subnet router pod in the hub cluster, and suddenly your laptop can reach any private IP across all the peered VPCs through your Tailnet. No bastion hosts, no SSH tunnels, no client VPN endpoint billing surprises. It just works and it's basically a lot less config compared to the alternatives.\n\n**What this is and is not:**\n\n- This is not production-hardened. It's a reference/starting point, not a turnkey platform.\n- This is not multi-cloud. It's AWS-only (EKS specifically).\n- This is opinionated by design: the addon choices, networking topology, and SkyPilot integration reflect a specific yet limited set of use cases. Your needs might call for different designs.\n\nIf you're setting up ML infrastructure on AWS and want a place to start, or if you're curious about how these pieces fit together, take a look.

      "text": "The deployment of Two-Tower models for retrieval usually involves significant infrastructure overhead. Beyond just training the user and item encoders, the production pipeline typically requires:\n\n1. Index Orchestration: Triggering embedding updates whenever item metadata changes to prevent drift.\n2. Vector DB Synchronization: Managing the handoff between the feature store and the ANN index (e.g Pinecone, Milvus, or Weaviate).\n3. Hybrid Querying: Implementing a way to combine vector similarity with hard business logic (e.g filtering out \"out of stock\" items) without incurring significant latency penalties.\n\nThe code required to keep these systems in sync often becomes more complex than the model architecture itself.\n\nWe’ve been working on a more declarative approach that treats the training, indexing, and retrieval as a single layer. By using a SQL-based interface, you can query the model directly, the system handles the embedding updates and indexing in the background, allowing for standard WHERE clauses to be applied to the similarity results.\n\nWe put together a technical breakdown of this architecture using a fashion marketplace as the case study. It covers:\n\n* Connecting Postgres/data warehouses directly to the training pipeline.\n* Configuring Two-Tower schemas via YAML.\n* Sub-50ms retrieval benchmarks when combining neural search with SQL filters.\n\nIf you’re interested in the implementation details or the pipeline design:  \n[https://www.shaped.ai/blog/how-to-deploy-a-production-two-tower-model-in-less-than-a-day](https://www.shaped.ai/blog/how-to-deploy-a-production-two-tower-model-in-less-than-a-day)\n\n*Full disclosure: I’m with the team at Shaped and authored this technical guide.*",

          "text": "This looks pretty great! A few things that stand out as especially well done:\n\nThe framing is correct. Root cause analysis in prod is mostly about context stitching across logs, metrics, and deploys, not about clever ML. The fact that the agent explicitly gathers and correlates across the stack is the real value here.\n\nI like that it reads the system on setup. Most tools fail because they stay generic and never internalize how a specific system is wired. Treating that as a first-class step is the right call.\n\nPosting findings back into Slack is underrated but critical. Debugging lives where humans already are. Anything that requires a separate UI to be useful usually dies.\n\nOne thing I would watch carefully as this evolves is trust calibration. Engineers need to know when the AI is confident versus when it is exploring. Clear signals around evidence strength, uncertainty, and “this is my best hypothesis” vs “this is confirmed” will matter a lot for adoption.\n\nAnother thought is historical learning. If logs expire, the real long-term value may be in the incident summaries it generates and how those feed future investigations. That is where this could compound.\n\nOverall, this looks like real infrastructure, not a demo. If you keep it grounded in observability first and avoid overclaiming intelligence, this could be something teams actually depend on in the future!",

The original dataset is extremely imbalanced (0.17% fraud), so I use\n\nbalanced resampling for faster iteration. Drift is synthetically injected, but\n\nall drift statistics and severity scores are real calculations.\n\n\n\nIn the demo, ModelGuard:\n\n\\- detects drift in 19 / 30 features (63%)\n\n\\- assigns HIGH severity (0.62)\n\n\\- flags a 77% drop in fraud-class F1\n\n\\- recommends retraining and creates a pending alert for human review\n\n\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/Aagam-Bothara/ModelGuard](https://github.com/Aagam-Bothara/ModelGuard)\n\n\n\nI’d really appreciate feedback from folks running models in prod:\n\n– does this feel realistic or over-engineered?\n\n– what would you simplify or remove?\n\n– what’s the first thing you’d add?\n\n",

      "text": "We needed observability for our LLM app but evaluating every production request would cost more than the actual inference. Here's what we implemented.\n\nDistributed tracing: Every request gets traced through its full execution path - retrieval, tool calls, LLM generation. When something breaks, we can see exactly which step failed and what data it received.\n\nSampled quality evaluation: Instead of running evaluators on 100% of traffic, we sample a percentage and run automated checks for hallucinations, instruction adherence, and factual accuracy. The sampling rate is configurable based on your cost tolerance.\n\nAlert thresholds: Set up Slack alerts for latency spikes, cost anomalies, and quality degradation. We track multiple severity levels - critical for safety violations, high for SLA breaches, medium for cost issues.\n\nDrift detection: Production inputs shift over time. We monitor for data drift, model drift from provider updates, and changes in external tool behavior.\n\nThe setup took about an hour using Maxim's SDK. We instrument traces, attach metadata for filtering, and let the platform handle aggregation.\n\nDocs: [https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/tracing/overview](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/tracing/overview)\n\nHow are others handling production monitoring without breaking the bank on evals?",

          "text": "OCR accuracy matters less than extraction accountability. When GenAI extracts wrong field from invoice, can you prove which text it saw and why it chose that interpretation?\n\nWe layer OCR methods too - traditional for structured forms, AI for complex layouts, GenAI for unstructured docs. Works until Legal asks \"what text informed this customer data extraction\" and we have confidence scores but not the actual OCR output the model operated on.\n\nThe systems problem isn't fallback strategies, it's decision evidence. Confidence threshold says \"trust this\" but doesn't capture what text was extracted, whether it was from correct page region, or why boundary detection chose those coordinates.\n\nYour layered approach handles accuracy. The gap: when extraction breaks, can you replay the exact OCR output and layout interpretation the model saw? Or just thresholds and final results?",

                  "text": "Yeah, I have done a smaller version of it. We ran FastAPI as a thin control layer in front of GPUs on Lambda so the interface, routing, and logging were ours, and compute was just an execution backend.\n\nThe separation worked well conceptually, but at the scale we were at it ended up costing more than I expected once you factor in always-on capacity and lower utilization. That pushed me to stay inside wrapper constraints a bit longer while being more deliberate about versioning and observability.\n\nThe main thing I took away is that owning even a minimal control plane is the key inflection point. You do not need to go all the way to full self hosting immediately, but once you own the interface, switching execution backends becomes a business decision instead of a rewrite.",
