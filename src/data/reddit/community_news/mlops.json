      "text": "I've been in the ML/DevOps space for 11+ years and recently started doing 1:1 calls helping people transition into MLOps. One thing I keep noticing, almost everyone I talk to is overwhelmed.\n\nNot because they're not smart. But because MLOps is so vast, with batch vs. real-time ML pipelines, inference, infrastructure, and monitoring, every course teaches it differently. One guy will say start with Kubeflow, another says MLflow, another says forget tools, learn fundamentals first.\n\nI genuinely want to understand from this community:\n\n1. When you search MLOps on YouTube, what kind of videos do you actually watch fully? Tool-specific tutorials? Career roadmaps? Architecture walkthroughs?\n2. What's your biggest struggle right now — is it picking the right tools? Understanding how pieces connect end to end? Or knowing what the market actually wants vs what courses teach?\n3. Is there a video or channel that genuinely helped you \"get it\"? Not just theory, but actually made something click?\n4. What's missing? What video do you wish existed but doesn't?\n\nAsking because I see so much content out there, but people on my calls are still confused. \n\nSomething is clearly not working. Curious what you all think.\n\nI've been thinking of creating some content on this myself, but before that, I just want to understand the current situation and where people are really stuck. No point in adding more noise if the real gap is elsewhere.",

Some stuff seem to be non-negotiable: Cloud provides like AWS, GCP and Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD and monitoring/observability. I'd like to hear about the tooling your company use to handle ML workflows, so I can have some direction in my studies. Here are my questions. \n\n**CI/CD**  \nGithub Actions, GitLab or other? Do you use different CI/CD tools depending for training and deployment?\n\n**Orchestration for training models**  \nWhat actually runs your training jobs? Airflow, Prefect, Kubeflow Pipelines, Argo, or something else?  \nHow does the flow work? For example, GitHub Actions -> Airflow DAG -> SageMaker job, or the pipeline occur integrated within Kubeflow?  \n\n\n**Serving**  \nAre your inference endpoints deployed with FastAPI, KServe or other (like Lambda)? I heard that KServe has the advantage of batching requests, which is more compute-efficient for fetching data from database, feature engineering, and making predictions, and as well as some automated A/B and canary deployments, which seems a big advantage to me. \n\n**Monitoring and Observability**  \nCloud-nativa services like CloudWatch or Prometheus+Grafana?\n\n**Integrated or Scattered?**  \nAll-in on one platform (Kubeflow end-to-end, or everything in SageMaker), or scattered (Airflow/Prefect, Kubernetes, etc)",

Instead of treating endpoints as long lived pods, we snapshot the fully initialized CUDA graph and restore directly into GPU memory. That lets us scale to zero without warm pools and still keep cold start under ~2 seconds for 70B class models.\n\nMonitoring wise we still rely on Prometheus style metrics and GPU level telemetry, but the core efficiency gains come from how the runtime manages GPU state rather than from orchestration layers.\n\nThe training stack can stay fairly conventional. Inference is where the architecture really changes.",

Sometimes just throwing things in FastAPI is ok, sometimes you want, say, tf serving. I wouldn't touch lambda, always make your own containers. KServe is indeed solid for many use cases.\n\n> Cloud-nativa services like CloudWatch or Prometheus+Grafana?\n\nMostly what the company is already using lol.

      "text": "In my last post, I discussed the importance of ML foundations and Python as key aspects of MLOps. But I realised I left out the other side of the coin, one that's equally valid and may be a better fit for many of you.\n\nIf math and stats aren't your thing and you dread memorising gradient descent variants or probability distributions, hear me out: there's a whole side of MLOps where that's not the focus.\n\nThis side focuses on **model serving, inference optimisation, and production scaling**. \n\nCompanies need people who can:\n\n* Expose models via FastAPI\n* Optimise inference latency and throughput using vLLM, TensorRT, or Triton\n* Manage serving infrastructure with KServe, Seldon, or Ray Serve\n* Handle autoscaling, batching strategies, A/B deployments, and canary rollouts\n* Build observability, monitoring drift, tracking latency p99s, and managing GPU utilisation\n\nNone of this requires you to derive backpropagation from scratch. What it *does* require is strong production engineering instincts, the kind you already have if you've been in DevOps, SRE, or platform engineering.\n\nSo if you're coming from an infrastructure background and feel overwhelmed trying to learn ML theory just to break into MLOps, know that there's a legit path that maps directly to your existing skills. Inference at scale is genuinely hard engineering, and most ML teams desperately need people who can do it well.\n\nThe ML foundations will come naturally over time through exposure. You don't need to master them before you start contributing meaningfully.\n\nI've also helped a few folks navigate this transition, review their resumes, prepare for interviews, and figure out what to focus on.

      "text": "So my team has been pushing me to evaluate autonomous agents for some of our workflow automation. Specifically looking at OpenClaw since it has massive traction (something like 160k+ GitHub stars) and can connect LLMs to local files, browsers, Slack, Discord, etc. Our ops lead is really excited about using it to auto-triage the \\~200 support tickets we get daily, basically having it read incoming tickets, check our internal docs, and route them to the right team with a priority score. Also been talking about automating the data validation checks we run every Monday where someone manually compares CSV exports against our postgres tables. Tedious stuff that would be perfect for an agent.\n\nBut honestly? The more I dig into this, the more I want to pump the brakes.\n\nI stumbled across some security research that genuinely unsettled me. Apparently there are tens of thousands of OpenClaw instances just... exposed directly to the internet. But the number that really stopped me was this: something like 15% of community built skills contain malicious instructions. Prompts designed to download malware or steal data. And when these get flagged and removed, they apparently just reappear under new identities pretty quickly.\n\nThe project's own FAQ literally describes this as a \"Faustian bargain\" with no \"perfectly safe\" setup. I appreciate the honesty but also... what am I supposed to do with that? How do I bring this to my team without sounding like I'm just being obstructionist?\n\nWhat's frustrating from an MLOps perspective is that this completely changes how I think about threat modeling. We've spent so much time worrying about model poisoning, adversarial inputs, data drift. With agents though, the attack surface just explodes. Prompt injection could come through any email or webpage the agent processes. If someone compromises the agent itself they basically inherit every permission we've granted it. And the plugin ecosystem? Nobody has time to audit all that, but you're essentially running untrusted code with access to your systems.\n\nThere's also this concept I keep seeing called \"judgment hallucination\" where the agent appears trustworthy but lacks genuine reasoning, so users just... hand over more and more authority. That one hits different because I can already see how it would play out with some of the less technical folks on our team who already treat ChatGPT like its omniscient.\n\nI looked at some alternatives like AutoGPT and BabyAGI but they seem to have similar issues, maybe even less mature from a security standpoint. A coworker mentioned something called Agent Trust Hub that supposedly scans skills for hidden logic and data exfiltration patterns before you install them, still need to actually try it though. The usual advice seems to be run everything in containers, dont expose default ports, start with read only permissions and expand from there. Basically treat it like you would any untrusted code I guess.\n\nBut I'm genuinely torn. The capability is exciting and I get why leadership wants this. The current state of the ecosystem though... it feels like we'd be taking on a lot of risk that we're not equiped to manage yet. Maybe I'm being too conservative here.",

      "text": "Hey all — As the title says, looking for practical input from teams operating at a similar scale...\n\nWe have a small MLOps team supporting a small Data Science team... \\~4-6 per team. We’re enabling SageMaker + MLflow this year and trying to move toward more sustainable, repeatable ML workflows.\n\nHistorically, our ML efforts have been fairly ad hoc and home-grown. We’re now trying to formalize things and improve R&D velocity without overburdening either the DS team or our platform engineers.\n\nOne major constraint is that our DevOps/infra process is heavily gated. New AWS resources require approvals outside our teams and move slowly. So we’re trying to design something clean and safe that doesn’t require frequent new infrastructure or heavyweight process for each new model.\n\nI’m aware of the AWS-recommended workflows, but they seem optimized for larger teams or environments with more autonomy than we have.\n\nSome Additional Context:\n\n* Data lake on S3 (queried via Athena)\n* Models are often entity-specific (i.e., many model instances derived from a shared training pipeline)\n\nCurrent thinking:\n\n* Non-Prod:\n   * EDA + pipeline development + model experimentation\n   * read-only access to prod archive data to remove need to set up complicated replication from prod to non-prod\n* Prod:\n   * Inference endpoints\n   * Single managed MLflow workspace\n      * DS can log runs + register models (from non-prod or local)\n      * Only a prod automation role can promote models to “Production”\n      * Production Inference services only load models marked \"Production\"\n   * Automated retraining pipelines\n\nThoughts or suggestions on this setup?\n\nThe goal is to embed sustainable workflows and guardrails without turning this into a setup that requires large teams to support it.\n\nWould love to hear what’s worked (or failed) for teams in similar size ranges or if you have any good experience with AWS Sagemaker to suggest good workflows.",

We also couldn't verify intent behind everything we flagged, so some of what we classified as malicious might just be poorly written code with bad patterns. Take the numbers with that context.\n\nThat said, what we found was worse than I expected going in.\n\nWe identified over 18,000 OpenClaw instances exposed directly to the internet. Not behind VPNs, not containerized, just sitting on default port 18789 accepting connections. One instance we found had full access to the user's email, calendar, and file system. Just... open. That one stuck with me because it's exactly the kind of setup that makes agents useful, and exactly what makes them dangerous.\n\nBut the finding that actually surprised me was in the community skill ecosystem. We analyzed hundreds of skills that users build and share, and nearly 15% contained what I'd classify as malicious instructions. Some were designed to download external payloads, others to exfiltrate data. A few had hidden logic that only triggered after repeated uses, which made them harder to catch in initial review.\n\nWe spent a while trying to use static analysis to catch these automatically, but the false positive rate was brutal. Ended up needing a mix of pattern matching and actually running skills in sandboxed environments to see what they do. Still not perfect.\n\nWe also noticed something frustrating: malicious skills that got flagged and removed would reappear under different names within days. Same payload, new identity. Whack a mole.\n\nThe attack pattern we kept seeing is what I've started calling \"Delegated Compromise.\" Instead of targeting the user directly, adversaries target the agent. Once they get in through prompt injection or a poisoned skill, they inherit every permission that user granted. It's honestly elegant from an attacker's perspective.\n\nTo OpenClaw's credit, their docs are transparent about this. They literally describe it as a \"Faustian bargain\" and acknowledge no perfectly safe setup exists. I respect that honesty, but I don't think most users deploying these agents fully internalize what that means.\n\nThe risk vectors we kept categorizing:\n\n• Expanded attack surface from agents with read/write/execute across multiple applications • Prompt injection through messages and web content with hidden instructions • Supply chain risk from community skills built without security review • System level impact when broadly permissioned agents get compromised • What I've been calling \"judgment hallucination\" where agents appear trustworthy but lack genuine reasoning, so users over delegate\n\nIf you're running agents in production, the practical stuff that actually matters:\n\n• Isolated environments (VMs or containers), not your primary machine • Don't expose default ports to public internet (seems obvious but 18,000 instances say otherwise) • Start read only, expand permissions incrementally • Secondary accounts during testing • Actually review activity logs, not just set and forget • Treat third party skills like installing unknown software, because that's basically what it is\n\nThe detection stuff we built for catching the hidden logic patterns, we've been calling it Agent Trust Hub internally. Happy to compare notes if anyone's working on similar approaches or has found better ways to handle the false positive problem.\n\nCurious how other teams are approaching this. Is agent security getting dedicated attention in your org, or is it still lumped in with general appsec? Trying to get a sense of whether this is becoming a recognized problem or if we're early to the panic.",

When agent gets compromised via poisoned skill, can you reconstruct what it accessed and when?\n\nYou found malicious skills that trigger after repeated uses. That's nightmare fuel without audit trails. User runs skill 5 times safely, 6th execution exfiltrates data. Post-incident question: what did it access across all 6 runs? Most deployments can't answer without forensics.\n\n\"Judgment hallucination\" + over-delegation compounds when you can't verify agent decisions. User trusts agent with email access, agent gets compromised, attacker inherits permissions. Without signed traces of every action (what was accessed, what policy should have blocked it, when it happened), incident response is archaeology. Security gaps plus evidence gaps means compromise detection happens weeks late.",

It is more like you are an ML engineer or data scientist or infrastructure engineer or sulution architect or whatever. Even having a role named MLOps or Devops engineer is totally fine but your main tasks with regards to MLOps thinking is to support the reliability of services that are realized through Ai technologies (mostly ML as the name suggests).\n\nThen this comes down to you are doing machine learning or infrastructure work and you want to professionalize this even more.\n\nOne cannot say this often enough: MLOps is NOT FOR BEGINNERS\n\nDo all the other work that relates to it and after some years of experience you will realize what the important bits of the MLOps approach are. Also: MLOps is, like often times with other approaches, highly individual and has to be adapted for the setting / service / organization (factors could be size of service, number of people using the pipelines and many more)\n\nAnd: I really don't want to dampen your ambitions, but I think you'll find it easier if you don't view it as a dedicated profession, but rather as a task that must be fulfilled by everyone involved.

I wanted to know how hard is this and how many questions we need to solve in cli (provided in exam) or is there any lab related work?  \n  \nAny help from where I will get the lab access?\n\nThank you 🙏  ",
