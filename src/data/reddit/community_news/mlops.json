      "text": "We spent a few months now on a solution for dynamic model routing because we tried several things and nothing really solved our problem.\n\nThe core issue / our background: we deployed nodes with SLM and RAG to regulated industry teams (the problem is relevant in any setup though). But users couldn't figure out when to use which model (despite ongoing effort to educate). We tried static routing but the classification of queries upfront didn't really work as it was very unpredictable what the users were doing. Also the \"guessing\" part did not feel right, we iterated really a lot on this. So next we thought hybrid with big models would be the solution but somewhat similar we always had to estimate complexity before we saw output. The estimates missed often enough that we either overspent (like, radically, breaking our unit economics) or quality was bad from routing too aggressively to small models.\n\nWe found a Google publication (happy to share) that approaches this very differently, not routing but cascading. Start generating with the small model, validate quality as you go, escalate only if needed.\n\nWe developed this and open-sourced our implementation: [github.com/lemony-ai/cascadeflow](http://github.com/lemony-ai/cascadeflow)\n\nIt plugs into your existing infrastructure, works with LiteLLM, OpenRouter, n8n, LangChain, or direct API calls. From there you can use whatever models you want: OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, HuggingFace, local models via Ollama, self-hosted via vLLM.\n\nNot replacing your router or orchestration layer, just adding quality validation that decides when the cheap models output is actually good enough.\n\nSeeing 40-90% cost reduction in first production workloads and we are honestly quite excited. Would love feedback and happy to chat with others working on inference layers.",

Transitioned into MLOps over the past few years.\n\nThe hiring manager asked: \"How would you help build a platform for our data science and research teams?\"\n\nMy brain immediately jumped to: Kubernetes, model serving, MLflow, autoscaling, GPU scheduling...\n\nBut that's not what they were asking. They wanted to know whether I understood the *problems* DS teams actually face day to day.\n\nI stumbled. Not because I don't know the tech, but because I framed everything around my expertise instead of their pain points.\n\nIt made me realise something (probably obvious to many of you, but it was a gap for me):\n\nIn DevOps, the customer is fairly clear—developers want to ship faster, ops wants reliability. In MLOps, you're serving researchers and data scientists with very different workflows and frustrations.\n\nThe infra knowledge is table stakes. The harder part is understanding things like:\n\nWhy does a 3-hour training job failing on a dependency error feel so demoralising?\n\nWhy do they keep asking for \"just one more GPU\"?\n\nWhy does reproducibility matter *to them*, not just to the platform team?\n\nStill working on building this muscle. Curious if others who've made the DevOps → MLOps shift have run into something similar?",

The reason I passed is that I focused nicely on understanding **NIM microservices, Triton Inference Server, and Kubernetes scaling**. If I had relied only on my generic \"coding agents\" knowledge, I would have failed.\n\nAlso, Don't make my mistake—study the \"boring\" safety docs of safety, Ethics and Human in Loop Too!\n\n  \n**Rest assured, Ask me Anything about the exam and I will try my best to help** ",

AIIO is more about understanding the NVIDIA ecosystem and infra basics, while AAI dives into building and deploying agentic AI apps.

They complement each other depending on whether you’re infra‑heavy or app‑heavy. As for plans, I don't have any near future plans for NCA-AIIO.\n\nThanks, and yes, safety, ethics and compliance stuff is important, and it contains a very wide range of issues and solutions than we normally understand.

You’ll be asked to share your screenwhile completing the exercises.\n\nCoding will focus on ML algorithms and implementations, transformer‑based GenAI concepts, debugging, and troubleshooting—not LeetCode‑style problems.\n\nAdditional Note:\n\nYou will have full access to the internet and LLMs during the interview.\n\nWhat do you guys think, I should focus on the live coding part knowing that I’ll have access to llms?\n\nI do have practical experience in deployment, works as a data scientist and finishing a masters in computer science in Georgia tech.",

I have built the training pipelines and everything works nicely, I can register models and use them for scoring locally. However, I have had no luck deploying. I cannot seem to get the versions of packages to match up. The official Microsoft docs seem to be using varying versions and I just want a combination that works.  \n  \nWould y'all have any tips on finding one working combination and sticking to it? We are just in the building phase, so I can change everything still.\n\n(I am trying to deploy an xgboost model if that helps)\n\nThanks heaps!",

In our case it replaced multiple research university class on-prem HPC clusters. It can support relatively arbitrary tooling and we have people that use python, r, julia, rust but also stata, matlab, and fortran. In a pinch I've gotten some java stuff working on it that would have been annoying otherwise.\n\n\nUsually it's compared to databricks, which we also have, but it goes far beyond what dbx can do and has the added bonus of no usage based billing, so higher upfront cost, but dramatically lower total cost. Internally, dbx is just used by data engineers to create tables and then is wired up to starburst. People either query starburst, dbx directly, or random on-prem sql databases and pull it all into domino to do the actual work with whatever tools they need. They deploy the models as batch jobs, flyte jobs, or as model API's and might wrap a dash/shiny/streamlit app or something around the deployed model api as an easy to use front end. It handles all the scaling and auth for us and has this governance policy thing that lets you gate deployments, so you don't have to figure out wtf paperwork you have to do beforehand. Just fill in the blank and legal or risk or whoever gets an email telling them to go read your answers and approve or reject. \n\n\nHas its own MLFlow server and you can spin up spark, ray, dask, and MPI clusters and all the other typical MLOps features you'd expect. \n\n\nIt's just a more cohesive vision and actually works instead of the half baked stuff the hyperscalers sell. Definitely not for everyone, but tends to just work. If you google it look for the user guide, the main site is pretty marketing heavy.",

I'm gathering insights on three specific \"pain points\" for research:\n\n1. If an agent takes 15 internal \"thought\" steps, and each takes 1.5s, that’s a 22-second wait. Does your churn spike at 5s? 10s? Or do your users actually wait?\n2. How much time does your team waste trying to refactor layers (like moving PyTorch → TensorRT) only to have the accuracy drop or the conversion fail?\n3. Are you stuck paying for H100s because cheaper hardware (L4s/T4s) just can't hit the TTFT (Time to First Token) you need?",
