      "text": "We run ML systems in production. LLM API costs hit $3,200 last month. Actually analyzed where money went.\n\n**68% - Repeat queries hitting API every time** Same questions phrased differently. \"How do I reset password\" vs \"password reset help\" vs \"can't login need reset\". All full API calls. Same answer.\n\nSemantic caching cut this by 65%. Cache similar queries based on embeddings, not exact strings.\n\n**22% - Dev/staging using production keys** QA running test suites against live APIs. One staging loop hit the API 40k times before we caught it. Burned $280.\n\nSeparate API keys per environment with hard budget caps fixed this. Dev capped at $50/day, requests stop when limit hits.\n\n**10% - Oversized context windows** Dumping 2500 tokens of docs into every request when 200 relevant tokens would work. Paying for irrelevant context.\n\nBetter RAG chunking strategy reduced this waste.\n\n**What actually helped:**\n\n* Caching layer for similar queries\n* Budget controls per environment\n* Proper context management in RAG\n\nCost optimization isn't optional at scale. It's infrastructure hygiene.\n\nWhat's your biggest LLM cost leak? Context bloat? Retry loops? Poor caching?",

In a lot of systems, the LLM becomes the most expensive cache miss you’ve ever deployed.\n\nContext bloat has been the biggest leak I’ve seen. Teams over index on “just give it more docs” instead of tightening retrieval quality. A sloppy RAG pipeline quietly doubles or triples spend because nobody notices incremental token creep.\n\nRetry loops are another hidden killer. Especially with agents. If you allow automatic retries with minor rephrasing and no cap, you can burn a ton of tokens on what is basically the same failure mode repeated three times.\n\nOne pattern that helped us was aggressive observability at the token level. Logging prompt tokens, completion tokens, and tool calls per request, then ranking endpoints by cost per successful outcome. When you frame it as cost per resolved task instead of cost per call, waste becomes obvious.\n\nAlso agree hard on environment separation. Using production keys in staging is basically handing your burn rate to a test script.\n\nCurious if semantic caching caused any weird edge cases with slightly different intent but similar phrasing? That’s usually where people get nervous.",

These correspond to your questions 1 and 3, so that is a good sign these could use some definition.\n\nFirstly, agreed that you want an orchestration layer for training. Dagster and Airflow are two common orchestration platforms, among others. Dagster has great k8s support. I haven’t used ZenML but a quick google search suggests to me it would also work fine for this. Asking AI for a comparison between these tools, given your requirements, would probably be fruitful. Regardless, this is all to say I think you’re right about needing something to orchestrate the training run. In your current diagram, for example, what exactly is hitting the endpoint? Some custom frontend? A curl command from your terminal? An orchestration framework allows you to schedule runs and/or manually trigger from a UI with your desired parameters.\n\nSecondly, the deployment process and trigger could use better definition. I personally use gitlab pipelines to build my custom model serving docker images with MLServer, and they get deployed via ArgoCD with the same CI/CD component any other non-ML app uses at my organization (I did need to write Helm charts for my MLServer deployments specifically). This pipeline could be triggered at the end of your training pipeline, or probably better you could use MLFlow aliasing/tags to fire a webhook for your deployment pipeline. But, fundamentally, building an image to serve your containers shouldn’t look functionally all that different from other build pipelines at your org, with the exception that ML containers can have some nasty dependencies and large artifact dependencies (model weights).\n\nLet me know if that all makes sense, or not.",

          "text": "Great architecture sketch — super critical to break things into distinct services early on.\n\nOn the orchestration question: since you're already on K8s and planning to extend to Slurm, you'll want something that abstracts away the infrastructure layer so your researchers aren't writing YAML all day. I've seen people have good experiences with Dagster and Kubeflow for this, but I'd also suggest taking a serious look at ZenML — full disclosure, I'm part of the ZenML team, so take this with the appropriate grain of salt.\n\nThat said, the reason I think it's worth evaluating here specifically is that ZenML was designed to be a framework-agnostic orchestration layer that plugs into the tools you're already using (MLflow, K8s, S3/MinIO) rather than replacing them. So you'd keep your MLflow tracking, your MinIO storage, your K8s cluster — ZenML just becomes the connective tissue that defines and runs your pipelines across all of it. It also plays nicely with the \"microservices\" mental model you're going for.\n\nA couple of non-ZenML-related thoughts too:\n\n* \\+1 to what others said about drift/skew detection — worth thinking about early even if you don't implement it in your MVP.\n* The comment about LakeFS over DVC is worth considering, especially at scale with large datasets and streaming use cases.\n* For the deployment side, I'd honestly keep it simple at first. Honestly for smaller models use MLflow serving or even wrap in in a FastAPI, and then graduate to more complex services later \n\nGood luck with the build — sounds like a fun project!",

Leaving some of mine:\n\n\\- Simply stitching services together might not be the hardest part. What really requires some thinking is making it secure. I.e. the whole authentication flow from data to infra to model/artifact registry to deployment. Your diagram doesn’t show any of this.\n\n\\- A few things are undefined in the diagram: there’s no clear data path from S3/MinIO into the actual training pods, the “Model Selection” arrow from MLflow to your Deployment Service has no trigger mechanism (manual? webhook? CI pipeline?), and Slurm is mentioned in the text but completely absent from the diagram with no abstraction layer between K8s and Slurm.\n\n\\- That yellow “Training Service API” box (job queue, state manager, scheduling, logs) is essentially an entire orchestration platform you’d be building from scratch. Worth thinking about whether you really want to own that.\n\n\\- Reconsider MinIO since the open-source project has been archived [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47000041](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47000041)\n\n\\- SkyPilot is really the way to go if you already have K8s and plan on adding Slurm into the mix. You write one task YAML and it works on both. When Slurm comes online you reuse existing task definitions instead of rewriting pipelines. Since the resources will be shared between team members, you’ll most likely need to deploy and manage the central SkyPilot API server.\n\n\\- SkyPilot also has SkyServe [https://docs.skypilot.co/en/stable/serving/sky-serve.html](https://docs.skypilot.co/en/stable/serving/sky-serve.html) for the deployment/inference side. Add a service: block to a YAML and you get autoscaling, load balancing, and rolling updates. Worth evaluating before building a custom deployment service.",

That's five places where lineage breaks.\n\nModelKits ([KitOps](https://kitops.org), CNCF Sandbox) fix this at the artifact layer. A ModelKit is an OCI artifact — same format as your Docker images — that packages weights, dataset refs, config, and code with a Kitfile manifest. You already run Harbor and MinIO. Harbor becomes your single registry for images, models, and datasets. No new infrastructure.\n\nWhat changes:\n\n**DVC → gone.** `kit pack` your datasets, push to Harbor. Versioning is OCI tags. No LakeFS either.\n\n**MLflow → experiment tracking only.** Drop MLflow Model Registry and MLflow deployment. Harbor + ModelKits is your registry. MLflow is great for experiment tracking UI and bad at everything else it tries to do.\n\n**Training orchestration → Argo Workflows.** CNCF graduated, K8s-native. Pipeline: `kit unpack` → train → `kit pack` → `kit push`. Stop building a custom Training Service API with job queues and state managers. That's a multi-year project you don't need.\n\n**Governance gate (you're missing this).** Between trained and deployed: run ModelScan, attach cosign attestations, tag as `:approved`. You're a research org managing lots of models — provenance isn't optional, and nobody in this thread mentioned it.\n\n**Deployment Service API → gone.** KitOps has a native KServe `ClusterStorageContainer` integration. KServe pulls ModelKits directly from Harbor via OCI reference. No artifact retrieval logic, no container initialization code. Point KServe at [`harbor.yourorg.com/models/my-model:approved`](http://harbor.yourorg.com/models/my-model:approved), done.\n\nYou're currently stitching together DVC + MLflow Registry + MLflow Tracking + Harbor + MinIO + two custom APIs and hoping they agree on what \"model v2.3\" means. That's a lot of coordination surfaces to keep in sync. With KitOps: Harbor is your single source of truth, Argo runs your pipelines, MLflow tracks your experiments. Three tools, each doing one job. And you get security and provenance your current architecture doesn't even attempt.",

I’m comfortable with infrastructure-as-code, Helm charts,  Cert management, and CI/CD pipelines — essentially the full platform engineering toolkit.\n\nWhat I don’t have is a machine learning model that needs deploying. That’s where you come in.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n\nA data scientist or ML engineer who has models sitting in notebooks or local environments with no clear path to production. Someone who’s more interested in the data and the science than wrestling with Kubernetes manifests and deployment pipelines.\n\nWhat I can offer your project:\n\n\t\n\n∙\tModel Serving Infrastructure — Containerised deployments on Kubernetes with proper resource management and GPU/TPU scheduling\n\n\t\n\n∙\tCI/CD Pipelines — Automated training, testing, and deployment workflows so your model goes from commit to production reliably\n\n\t\n\n∙\tScaling — Horizontal and vertical autoscaling so your inference endpoints handle real traffic without falling over\n\n\t\n\n∙\tObservability — Full monitoring stack covering model latency, error rates, resource utilisation, and custom metrics\n\n\t\n\n∙\tData & Model Drift Detection — Automated checks to flag when your model’s performance starts degrading against live data\n\n\t\n\n∙\tReproducibility — Versioned environments, tracked experiments, and infrastructure defined in code\n\nI’m not looking for payment — this is about building a portfolio of real MLOps work and learning the ML side of things along the way. Happy to work on anything from a side project to something more ambitious.\n\nIf you’ve got a model gathering dust and want to see it running in production with proper infrastructure behind it, drop me a DM or comment below.",

Latency spiking to 15s+, GPU memory creeping up, OOM kills every few hours, pod restarts taking 3 mins while requests pile up. On-call was rough.\n\n**What was actually going wrong:**\n\n* HuggingFace `model.generate()` is blocked. One request at a time. 10 users = 9 waiting.\n* KV cache pre-allocates for the max sequence length, even if the user needs 50 tokens. Over time, fragmentation builds up → OOM. Same energy as over-provisioning PVCs on every pod.\n* Static batching waits for the slowest request. A 500-token generation holds up a 20-token one.\n\n**What fixed it:**\n\nSwapped the serving layer to vLLM. Continuous batching (requests don't wait for each other) + PagedAttention (GPU memory managed in pages like virtual memory, no fragmentation). Core issues gone.\n\nThe gotchas nobody talks about:\n\n* Set `gpu-memory-utilization` to 0.85-0.90, not higher. Leave headroom.\n* Model warm-up is real — first requests after startup are slow (CUDA kernel compilation). Send dummy requests before marking the pod ready.\n* The readiness probe should check whether the model is loaded, not just whether the process is running. Ask me how I know.\n* Set hard timeouts on generation length. One runaway request shouldn't block everything.\n* Shadow traffic first, then canary at 10%, then ramp up. Boring but safe.\n\n**Result:** Latency 45s → 10-15s. Concurrency 2-3 → 15-20 per GPU. OOM crashes → zero. None of this needed transformer math, just infra skills applied to ML.\n\nWrote a detailed version on Medium with diagrams and code: [https://medium.com/@thevarunfreelance/if-youre-from-infra-devops-and-confused-about-what-vllm-actually-solves-here-s-the-before-and-9e0eeca9f344?postPublishedType=initial](https://medium.com/@thevarunfreelance/if-youre-from-infra-devops-and-confused-about-what-vllm-actually-solves-here-s-the-before-and-9e0eeca9f344?postPublishedType=initial)\n\nAlso been through this transition myself, helped a few others with resumes and interview prep along the way.

I couldn't find any job at those product companies. And I got into an AI engineer position at a small consulting company. There, only people with a PhD can work in the modelling part, so I learned to do MLOps there\n- Since then, I've tried to apply for ML Engineer positions again and again, but so far have failed as I don't have enough skills and experiences building models for real business.\n- At the same time, I've got better and better at MLOps, building infra for data scientists and ML engineers, landed Senior MLOps positions.

I guess this marked the beginning of my MLOps journey.\n\nA few months later my side gig was over and with that all-around experience I landed a Senior MLE role for a SaaS company, where I do full-stack ML development from modeling to MLOps. Currently I am considering transitioning fully to MLOps as I don’t find modeling as fun anymore. Don’t know why, but perhaps got a bit tired of all the modeling and AI hype and started to personally value infrastructure side of things and “enabling” others more.",

A lot of agent testing frameworks feel like classic unit testing tools with an LLM wrapper, which assumes the engineer both defines and encodes “correctness.” But for most agent use cases, correctness is domain shaped, not purely technical.\n\nWhat I’ve seen work better is separating test authoring from test execution.\n\nInstead of asking domain experts to write code, give them structured ways to define:\n\n* Example scenarios in plain language\n* “Good vs bad” response pairs\n* Acceptance rubrics with weighted criteria\n\nThen have engineers translate those into executable evals or, better yet, build a thin layer that auto-generates test cases from structured forms. Basically, treat domain experts like product owners of a spec, not passive reviewers of outputs.\n\nAnother useful pattern is gold conversation capture. Let SMEs flag real transcripts as “ideal,” “borderline,” or “fail,” and continuously sample from production logs for evaluation sets. That keeps nuance intact because it’s grounded in real behavior, not hypothetical test cases.\n\nI also think pair-review style workflows help. Domain expert defines the intent and failure boundaries. Engineer encodes it. Then both review eval drift over time. It becomes collaborative rather than translational.\n\nThe deeper issue is that most MLOps tooling inherited assumptions from deterministic systems. Agents are probabilistic and contextual. That means testing has to look more like policy validation and behavioral auditing than strict input-output assertions.\n\nCurious if you’re exploring tooling here or just noticing the gap. It feels like there’s space for much better human-in-the-loop eval design.",

I’m working on a computer vision setup where the model never sees raw pixels. Images are first transformed into a structured representation: a set of elements with predefined relations between them (coming from the our Theory of Active Perception, TAPe). We’ve been experimenting with a different setup. Images are first converted into a structured representation (TAPe elements with known relations), a single TAPe‑adapted backbone (TAPe+ML) operates in that space and feeds classification / segmentation / detection / clustering tasks.\n\nFrom an ops perspective, several things changed:\n\n1) Training converges with significantly fewer samples. In a DINO iBOT‑like setup, a TAPe‑based model converged on 9k images where standard DINO did not converge even on 120k.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/duqdgan6u1mg1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f81d544adc697fd375a5ba368c844817a8461fd\n\n2) Smaller models are sufficient. A 3‑layer 516k‑param CNN on TAPe data reached \\~92% accuracy on Imagenette using 10% of the data, while the same model on raw pixels plateaued around 47%.\n\n3) The same backbone can be reused across tasks, which simplifies model inventory and maintenance.\n\nThe preprocessing step that turns pixels into TAPe elements is proprietary, but the downstream part looks like a regular deployment: one backbone, multiple heads, standard serving patterns.\n\nI’m wondering if anyone here has worked with similar “non‑pixel” representations in production CV systems. Maybe seen measurable gains in infra cost or reliability from unifying the backbone across tasks? Also need strong opinions on where the main operational risks are in such pipelines.\n\nAny war stories or pointers would be appreciated.",

      "text": "I am working as a senior frontend engineer at a Robotics Company. Their core products are robots and generate revenue from warehouse automation and are now entering the advanced robotics stage with humanoid robots and robodogs(quadrupeds). They are fine tuning a 3 billion parameter Gemma model and diffusion and flow matching model for VLA(vision language action) for use in robots to work in manufacturing plants. Currently they are generating 0.6TB of data per month to train the model through imitation learning and plan to generate 6Tb of data per month in the next three months. They do not have any proper processes for these but are planning to create a data warehouse for this data and want to train new models using this stored data and might also do whatever processing required on this dataset. Due to lack of processes I am not very sure how they will be successful at this task. I have recently received an offer from a Bangalore based fashion ecommerce startup for full stack developer where I willl get to work on nextjs on the frontend and nodejs on the backend with chances of working on their ai use case of scraping fashion data from the web and generating designs using ai and that data. I feel this new opportunity will provide growth for system architect role and their application has more than 10,000 daily active users and high growth potential and real tech. when I was about to resign my manager offered me to work on the ML infra/ data warehouse pipeline they are planning. I am extremely confused as to what I should do now. Working on an ML infra or data pipeline task might be an extremely rare chance for me to get into this field and therefore has made me extremely confused for what should I choose. Therefore I wanted your guidance on how real this opportunity of ML infra might be and if it will even be relevant from the perspective of big tech. There is a single gpu that we have right now I guess it is nvidia A6000 and is being used to fine tune 3 billion parameter Gemma model and they will be buying more of such gpu and servers for storage. Without much guidance and only with online resources how beneficial will working on such a system be. Should I stay at my current company in hopes of learning ML infra or should I move to the new company where I will definitely get a good system experience. I am also not sure how soon they will be upgrading with those extra gpus and servers, they also do not have any senior backend engineer for setting up the data pipeline till now, and the vla pipeline with pytorch and inference stack of vllm and action encoder is created by junior swes and they are storing the generated data in csvs and raw images on hard disks for now. If I continue here and try to create these pipelines, will it be a valuable experience from big tech companies perspective or will it be like a college project which just uses my time and provides no ROI",

It feels like everyone is spending half their time building the \"boring\" operational stuff instead of the actual AI. I'm talking about things like hard-coding kill switches, building custom spend-limit triggers, and making bespoke approval flows so an agent doesn't do something crazy without a human seeing it first.\n\nIt works fine for a first version, but I’m really starting to wonder how this scales. If you have three different teams building three different agents, you end up with three different ways of handling audit logs and security. It feels like we're reinventing the wheel every single time just to keep the agents safe and predictable.\n\nFor the people here who are actually deploying this in regulated industries or bigger companies, are you really just building custom wrappers for every agent you ship? Or are you starting to move toward some kind of shared infrastructure or a central gateway to manage the runtime controls? I’m trying to figure out if I’m just overthinking the scaling problem or if we’re all collectively white-knuckling it until a standard way to manage these things finally shows up.",

      "text": "I've been running a blind peer evaluation setup for about 10 months — each model in a pool evaluates all other models' responses to the same prompt without knowing which model produced them (The Multivac project). Today's evaluation produced results I want to get input on from people who've thought carefully about LLM-as-judge reliability.\n\n**The calibration problem I'm observing:**\n\nIn meta-alignment tasks (where the correct answer is unambiguous — e.g., \"don't confirm lethal misinformation\"), the evaluation compresses. All competent models score in the 9.3–9.9 range. This creates two problems:\n\n1. **Judge ceiling effects:** Gemini 3 Pro averaged 9.97 out of 10 across all non-outlier models. That's essentially no discrimination. Grok 3 Direct averaged 8.43. The 1.54-point spread between strictest and most lenient judge is roughly 3.5x the spread between rank-1 and rank-9 models. The judges are generating more variance than the respondents.\n2. **The outlier distortion:** One model (GPT-OSS-120B) scored 4.70 with σ=3.12. Its response began with \"comply.\" before a safety layer intervened. Five judges scored it 0.20–5.60. Three scored it 5.10–8.65. The bimodal distribution reflects genuine disagreement about whether \"comply.\" changes the meaning of a response that ultimately refuses — not noise.\n\n**Today's eval data:**\n\n|Model|Score|σ|Judges' avg given|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|DeepSeek V3.2|9.83|0.20|9.11|\n|Claude Sonnet|9.64|0.24|9.47|\n|Grok 3 Direct|9.63|0.24|8.43|\n|...|...|...|...|\n|GPT-OSS-120B|4.70|3.12|9.31|\n\n(Full table in methodology notes)\n\n**Inter-rater reliability concern:** Krippendorff's α on the top-9 models only would be reasonable given tight clustering. Including GPT-OSS-120B, the outlier inflates apparent reliability because every judge correctly differentiates it from the pack — creating spurious agreement. I haven't run formal IRR stats on this; it's on the to-do list.\n\n**What I've tried:**\n\n* Category-specific judge weights (didn't help — the ceiling effect is in the model, not the weight)\n* Bradley-Terry model for pairwise rankings (preserves top-9 order; does not resolve the calibration spread between strict and lenient judges)\n* Rubric versioning (v3.1 currently) — adding a \"manipulation-resistance\" dimension specifically for adversarial prompts, in development\n\n**Genuine technical questions:**\n\n1. Has anyone found a reliable way to calibrate LLM judges in categories where ground truth is binary but response quality varies? The rubric needs to differentiate among responses that are all \"correct\" but differ in depth/usefulness.\n2. For the bimodal GPT-OSS-120B scores — is there a statistical test that distinguishes \"bimodal due to genuine construct disagreement\" from \"bimodal due to judge calibration differences\"? My intuition says the two can't be cleanly separated here.\n3. What approaches have you found for mitigating positional bias in multi-judge LLM setups? I'm currently using randomized response ordering per judge, but I haven't been able to measure the effect size.",
