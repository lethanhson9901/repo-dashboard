      "text": "Something I've noticed after being in this space for a while, and mentioned in past weeks' posts as well.\n\nMLOps roles need strong infrastructure skills. Everyone agrees on that. The job descriptions are full of Kubernetes, CI/CD, cloud, distributed systems, monitoring, etc.\n\nBut the people interviewing you? Mostly data scientists, ML engineers, and PhD researchers.\n\nSo you end up in a strange situation where the job requires you to be good at production engineering, but the interview asks you to speak ML. And these are two very different conversations.\n\nI've seen really solid DevOps engineers, people running massive clusters, handling serious scale, get passed over because they couldn't explain what model drift is or why you'd choose one evaluation metric over another. Not because they couldn't learn it, but because they didn't realise that's what the interview would test.\n\nAnd on the flip side, I've seen ML folks get hired into MLOps roles and MAY struggle because they've never dealt with real production systems at scale.\n\nThe root cause I think is that most companies are still early in their ML maturity. They haven't separated MLOps as its own discipline yet. The ML team owns hiring for it, so naturally, they filter for what they understand: ML knowledge, not infra expertise.\n\nThis isn't a complaint, just an observation. And practically speaking, if you're coming from the infra/DevOps side, it means you kinda have to meet them where they are. Learn enough ML to hold the conversation. You don't need to derive backpropagation on a whiteboard, but you should be able to talk about the model lifecycle, failure modes, why monitoring ML systems is different from monitoring regular services, etc.\n\nThe good news is the bar isn't that high. A few weeks of genuine study go a long way. And once you bridge that language gap, your infrastructure background becomes a massive advantage, because most ML teams are honestly struggling with production engineering.\n\nCurious if others have experienced this same thing? Either as candidates or on the hiring side?\n\nI've also helped a few folks navigate this transition, review their resumes, prepare for interviews, and figure out what to focus on.

They are hiring people with skills they themselves don't have, so have no clue what questions to ask. Data scientists will of course ask questions on ML that nobody besides themselves needs to know much about.\n\nMost open positions are also junior ones, while this field could benefit from solid DevOps experience. They don't seem to grasp that transition from DevOps to MLOps is perhaps just a few weekends of study as these people don't need low level details/maths. They will not be implementing KServe, Dynamo, vLLM, Tensor-RT, they will be deploying these solutions and monitoring them.\n\nFor a data scientist, MLOps will not be interesting and they will likely leave.",

Even if they hire you, it will get ugly soon.\n\nScale-ups are at least starting to get in place there scale and quality becomes important, but they probably still too focused on their competitive advantage. Some AI feature that is, not something smooth and well running from day to day.\n\nI think the best places are way more mature companies which have experience with AI and want to turn it from a successful experiment to really stable service.

          "text": "What different teams are hiring for will depend on where that team is in terms of the maturity of its ML system as you rightly say OP. If they are at low levels of maturity, it is as you say often teams of scientists who are hiring and they will often just look for an engineer who can scale up and automate a lot of what they have been crafting - that means at interview they will want an engineer that talks their language and shows that they understand them. If the hiring org is mature, they have employed a system / platform that clearly dictates the engineering skills that need to be brought in.\n\nEvery business and even within a large business, the level of maturity varies dramatically. My advice to applicants looking for roles is to find the role that matches your skills and experience given that the responsibilities are so varied from company to company for the same job title. If you are looking to learn, a firm that is mature is the easiest way to understand scale but if you want a challenge, want to shape something that could be exciting, take a chance on a firm that doesn’t know what it wants if you think you can really help, you like their culture and the remuneration is agreeable. It could still be the happiest place you’ve ever worked (and some of the most fun data scientists I have ever worked with were the most clueless at what was needed outside of their IDE to make it all work).\n\nThat said…. If you aren’t able to explain concepts like model drift then you are unable to explain a key metric that helps determine the end of a model’s lifecycle (by monitoring its declining quality and kicking off a new build of the model). It is still never going to be the same as a DevOps or platform engineer and there will have to be language learnt that is employed by the data scientists if the engineers have not been/worked closely with data scientists previously.",

It works with Slurm and SkyPilot to build a unified experience for ML researchers.\n\nTrends we observed:\n\n* The frontier labs invest a ton to build and maintain their own proprietary tooling.\n* Most other AI/ML research teams work with a fragmented landscape of legacy scripts, manual workflows which gets more complicated as you grow your team and run more experiments\n* Researchers spend as much as half their time dealing with environment and experiment logistics. For example, results get lost or rerun because jobs fail before finishing and artifacts aren’t tracked consistently.\n\nHow Transformer Lab for Teams is helpful:\n\n* **Unified Interface:** A single dashboard to manage data ingestion, model fine-tuning, and evaluation.\n* **Seamless Scaling:** The platform is architected to run locally on personal hardware (Apple Silicon, NVIDIA/AMD GPUs) and seamlessly scale to high-performance computing clusters using orchestrators like Slurm and SkyPilot.\n* **Extensibility:** A flexible plugin system allows researchers to add custom training loops, evaluation metrics, and model architectures without leaving the platform.\n* **Privacy-First:** The platform processes data within the user's infrastructure, whether on-premise or in a private cloud, ensuring sensitive research data never leaves the lab's control.\n* **Simplifying workflows:** Capabilities that used to require complex engineering are now built-in.\n   * Capturing checkpoints (with auto-restart)\n   * One-line to add hyperparameter sweeps\n   * Storing artifacts in a global object store accessible even after ephemeral nodes terminate.\n\nThe project is **open source and free to use** with a goal to advance the tools used by any research team big and small.\n\nWould something like this be useful? Welcome feedback for us to make it better. I’m one of the maintainers and can answer any questions.\n\nTry it here: [https://lab.cloud/](https://lab.cloud/)\n\nAsk any questions below -- really excited to keep working on this with the community!",

At a high level, you clean and prepare data in a repeatable way, train models using scripts while tracking experiments and artifacts with tools like MLflow, package the final model into a service (usually FastAPI) and a Docker image, and then deploy that image on infrastructure like Kubernetes (for example EKS) so it can scale and stay up. CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions are mainly used to test code, build and push images (to ECR), and trigger deployments, not to train large models directly heavy training usually runs on dedicated compute (EKS jobs, Batch, SageMaker, etc.) and just reports results back to MLflow. The key idea is separating concerns: training is compute-heavy and controlled, deployment is automated, and monitoring closes the loop so you know when to retrain or update the model.",

For that you need buy-in with management and other teams. So it's a lot of pitching and powerpointing until you get there.\n\nThen comes a bit of architecture and system design. Any given design won't meet every requirement but you don't need to roll out everything at once. So work iteratively. Try to close the model lifecycle loop (the etl-train-eval-deploy-monitor-retrain) first. Then add the other features depending on need. The problem is the quality of the platform largely depends on the sum of the parts. It will be painful before it gets better.\n\nYou also need to figure out what you need and where it lives. Models, api keys, networking, dashboards, storage, vector databases, infra as code, ci/cd, git? Infra as code, templating, containers, what metrics do you track? p99, latency?\n\nYou can tell the biggest pain point for me has always been getting everyone on the same page. None of the folks I work with get it and think they can either do it themselves over the weekend or that it's complex and we need another 4 consultants.\n\nPersonally I've always used some Infra as code (CDK, terraform), some form of managed services for serving (no way you're going to handle everything without), mlflow, tensorboard. Start with terraform and build infra and templates first. I've had good experiences with AWS sagemaker and Bedrock, and GCP's Vertex.",

We're doing something similar for our document processing agent but hit a wall CI/CD doesn't solve: behavioral regression.\n\nYour pipeline deploys the model, runs tests, everything green. But when we update the underlying LLM (say GPT-4 to 4.5) or tweak retrieval logic, tests pass but production behavior changes on 15-20% of edge cases we never wrote tests for.\n\nCI catches code regressions because unit tests are deterministic. Agent behavior isn't. We have 80 synthetic test cases that pass every time, but production processes 5,000 document types with edge cases we didn't imagine. Model update ships, extraction accuracy drifts, customers notice before we do.\n\nThe gap: CI needs fixtures from production reality, not synthetic imagination. When agent breaks in prod, that failure should automatically become a regression test. Currently we fix the bug, merge, deploy, and six months later it happens again because we never captured the actual failure as a permanent fixture.\n\nYour tag-based deployment is clean, but how do you prevent model updates from silently changing behavior on real production patterns? Are you running evals against production traces, or just synthetic test suites?",

When you swap GPT-4 for 4.5, or tweak a retrieval embedding, the prompt's 'meaning' might stay the same, but the output distribution shifts.\n\nHere is how you can bridge that gap:\n\n* **CI is the Plumbing, Evals are the Gate:** GitHub Actions shouldn't run your 5,000-case regression suite it’s too heavy and non-deterministic. Instead, CI triggers an external **Evaluation Pipeline**.\n* **Production-to-Fixture Pipeline:**  treat production failures as the highest-value data. When a user flags a hallucination or an extraction error, that trace is automatically sanitized and added to a 'Golden Dataset.' Your test suite is no longer 'synthetic imagination'; it’s a reflection of reality.\n* **Semantic Versioning for Models:**  treat a model swap like a major database schema migration. We run the new model in 'Shadow Mode' against those production fixtures. We don't look for 1:1 string matches (which always break), but use **LLM-as-a-Judge** to ensure the extraction logic hasn't drifted.\n* **Drift Analytics:** The pipeline looks for 'Regression Sensitivity.' If the new model improves 5% of cases but breaks 2% of previously 'solved' edge cases, the CI/CD pipeline blocks the merge.\n\nHaven't tried though you can try like this or have you implemenetd differently ?",

We run evals with synthetic cases, maybe 50-100 scenarios. Production hits 5,000 edge cases we never imagined. Model update passes all tests, then 15% of real document extractions change behavior. Your embedding-based validation catches synthetic drift but wouldn't catch this.\n\nPortability is interesting but seems secondary to the core problem: when an LLM call breaks, can you replay what it saw? We had an incident where Legal asked \"what documents informed this decision\" and we had the prompt template from Git, request logs with timing, but zero proof of what docs were actually retrieved or how fresh they were. Took 4 hours to say \"we don't know.\"\n\nCheckpoints help with version control but unless they capture retrieval lineage (what was fetched, when, why), you're still debugging with incomplete information. Same with rollback - rolling back the prompt template doesn't rollback the stale cache that caused the bad output.\n\nHow does your checkpoint system handle dynamic context - retrieval, features, function outputs - that changes per request?

      "text": "The deployment of Two-Tower models for retrieval usually involves significant infrastructure overhead. Beyond just training the user and item encoders, the production pipeline typically requires:\n\n1. Index Orchestration: Triggering embedding updates whenever item metadata changes to prevent drift.\n2. Vector DB Synchronization: Managing the handoff between the feature store and the ANN index (e.g Pinecone, Milvus, or Weaviate).\n3. Hybrid Querying: Implementing a way to combine vector similarity with hard business logic (e.g filtering out \"out of stock\" items) without incurring significant latency penalties.\n\nThe code required to keep these systems in sync often becomes more complex than the model architecture itself.\n\nWe’ve been working on a more declarative approach that treats the training, indexing, and retrieval as a single layer. By using a SQL-based interface, you can query the model directly, the system handles the embedding updates and indexing in the background, allowing for standard WHERE clauses to be applied to the similarity results.\n\nWe put together a technical breakdown of this architecture using a fashion marketplace as the case study. It covers:\n\n* Connecting Postgres/data warehouses directly to the training pipeline.\n* Configuring Two-Tower schemas via YAML.\n* Sub-50ms retrieval benchmarks when combining neural search with SQL filters.\n\nIf you’re interested in the implementation details or the pipeline design:  \n[https://www.shaped.ai/blog/how-to-deploy-a-production-two-tower-model-in-less-than-a-day](https://www.shaped.ai/blog/how-to-deploy-a-production-two-tower-model-in-less-than-a-day)\n\n*Full disclosure: I’m with the team at Shaped and authored this technical guide.*",

That’s a big win for early experiments, internal tools, and small teams.\n\nA few questions that would help me understand how far this can go in real workflows:\n\n• Is the extraction deterministic, meaning the same page always produces the same output?  \n  \n• How do you think about drift and updates, for example re-ingesting pages that change over time?  \n  \n• When things go wrong, like odd markup, partial loads, or missing content, where is the best place to debug? Raw HTML, Mojo’s intermediate output, or the final chunks?\n\nOne thing that could make this even stronger is being explicit about failure modes and contracts in the README. In other words, what Mojo guarantees versus what it intentionally does not. Even a short section in the README about what Mojo will not handle would build a lot of trust.\n\nThanks for building and open-sourcing this, though!

              "text": "Hi, thanks for your question. My idea with Mojo is to provide fast conversion between pages and LLM data.\n\nAnswering your questions:\n\n**• Is the extraction deterministic, meaning the same page always produces the same output?**  \n→ The same HTML provides the same output. Right now there are two options to get data: with the `--render` flag and without it.\n\nThe first one uses pure HTTP requests (ideal for static web pages). With the `--render` flag, it connects to Chrome using CDP (so no extra dependencies are downloaded, just your existing setup). -- This is still not released, planned for 0.1.0, but you can build Mojo and test this feature\n\nSo it depends on the setup you are using and how the web page is programmed.\n\n**• How do you think about drift and updates, for example re-ingesting pages that change over time?**  \n→ In my opinion, the best way to handle this is via CI pipelines (Jenkins/GitHub Actions), but you can always set up cron jobs as well (macOS/Linux).\n\n**• When things go wrong, like odd markup, partial loads, or missing content, where is the best place to debug? Raw HTML, Mojo’s intermediate output, or the final chunks?**  \n→ In my opinion, the best way to debug is to fetch the page via `curl` and use a converter. For example:\n\n    curl -X GET your-web -o file.html\n\nThen later you can use Mojo to fetch the static source using:\n\n    ./mojo -d 0 file://your_file -o ./debug\n\nand see the output it generates (always with depth 0).\n\n**“One thing that could make this even stronger is being explicit about failure modes and contracts in the README. In other words, what Mojo guarantees versus what it intentionally does not. Even a short section in the README about what Mojo will not handle would build a lot of trust.”**\n\nThanks for your suggestion, I will include it after I finish the render crawler.\n\nThanks :)",

I think this is really a spectacular project my friend! :)\n\nThe deterministic model of “same HTML gives the same output” makes sense, and the split between pure HTTP fetching and the `--render` path is clear. Using CDP for rendering without pulling in extra dependencies seems like the right call for JS-heavy pages.\n\nThe CI / cron approach for handling drift also feels pragmatic. Treating ingestion as an explicit job instead of something implicit or magical is exactly how I’d expect this to be used in real pipelines! This is fantastic!\n\nSo, just to be sure I am understanding you properly, the optimal debugging workflow you described is:\n\n0. Fetch HTML with  `curl`\n\n1. Validate or convert it independently\n2. Run Mojo at depth 0 against a static source\n\n(Edit: sorry, I don't know what's wrong with this list, the Reddit formatting refuses to not render it with this weird spacing/gap for some reason I can't quite determine at the moment)  \n  \nIf that’s right, that’s a great, clean debugging protocol. It’s one of the most realistic and sane ways I’ve seen to isolate issues and understand where things are going wrong.\n\nI feel honored you found my simple README suggestion helpful at all. Being explicit about guarantees and non-goals is something I really appreciate in tools like this.\n\nThank you absolutely supremely for being a clear-minded thinker and building such beautiful tools that increase the coherence of the world :)\n\nLooking forward to seeing and testing out the render crawler once it's out. Thanks again for the thoughtful explanation and for building such a well-reasoned project. :)",

The sampling rate is configurable based on your cost tolerance.\n\nAlert thresholds: Set up Slack alerts for latency spikes, cost anomalies, and quality degradation. We track multiple severity levels - critical for safety violations, high for SLA breaches, medium for cost issues.\n\nDrift detection: Production inputs shift over time. We monitor for data drift, model drift from provider updates, and changes in external tool behavior.\n\nThe setup took about an hour using Maxim's SDK. We instrument traces, attach metadata for filtering, and let the platform handle aggregation.\n\nDocs: [https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/tracing/overview](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/tracing/overview)\n\nHow are others handling production monitoring without breaking the bank on evals?",

      "text": "Early OCR conversations often focus on models and accuracy benchmarks.\n\nIn production, the harder problems show up elsewhere.\n\nTraditional OCR fails quietly when layouts drift.\n\n AI based OCR improves coverage but needs stronger guardrails.\n\n GenAI works on complex documents, but requires careful controls to avoid unreliable outputs.\n\nAt scale, OCR becomes less about choosing a model and more about designing a system that knows when to trust automation and when to stop.\n\nMost production pipelines rely on layered approaches, confidence thresholds, fallback strategies, and human review for edge cases.\n\nFor teams running document extraction in production, when did choosing an OCR approach turn into an MLOps and systems decision for you?",

          "text": "OCR accuracy matters less than extraction accountability. When GenAI extracts wrong field from invoice, can you prove which text it saw and why it chose that interpretation?\n\nWe layer OCR methods too - traditional for structured forms, AI for complex layouts, GenAI for unstructured docs. Works until Legal asks \"what text informed this customer data extraction\" and we have confidence scores but not the actual OCR output the model operated on.\n\nThe systems problem isn't fallback strategies, it's decision evidence. Confidence threshold says \"trust this\" but doesn't capture what text was extracted, whether it was from correct page region, or why boundary detection chose those coordinates.\n\nYour layered approach handles accuracy. The gap: when extraction breaks, can you replay the exact OCR output and layout interpretation the model saw? Or just thresholds and final results?",
