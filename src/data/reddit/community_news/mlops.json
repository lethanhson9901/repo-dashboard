Had to build a whole sidecar pattern just to manage the lifecycle properly. How are you handling memory cleanup during the reload process? Also curious if you've tested this with models larger than a few GB - that's where things usually start breaking in my experience.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m excited to share that I’ve just published a new book titled **\"Ultimate ONNX for Deep Learning Optimization\"**.\n\nAs many of you know, taking a model from a research notebook to a production environment—especially on resource-constrained edge devices—is a massive challenge. ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) has become the de-facto standard for this, but finding a structured, end-to-end guide that covers the entire ecosystem (not just the \"hello world\" export) can be tough.\n\nI wrote this book to bridge that gap. It’s designed for ML Engineers and Embedded Developers who need to optimize models for speed and efficiency without losing significant accuracy.\n\n**What’s inside the book?** It covers the full workflow from export to deployment:\n\n* **Foundations:** Deep dive into ONNX graphs, operators, and integrating with PyTorch/TensorFlow/Scikit-Learn.\n* **Optimization:** Practical guides on Quantization, Pruning, and Knowledge Distillation.\n* **Tools:** Using ONNX Runtime and ONNX Simplifier effectively.\n* **Real-World Case Studies:** We go through end-to-end execution of modern models including **YOLOv12** (Object Detection), **Whisper** (Speech Recognition), and **SmolLM** (Compact Language Models).\n* **Edge Deployment:** How to actually get these running efficiently on hardware like the Raspberry Pi.\n* **Advanced:** Building custom operators and security best practices.\n\n**Who is this for?** If you are a Data Scientist, AI Engineer, or Embedded Developer looking to move models from \"it works on my GPU\" to \"it works on the device,\" this is for you.\n\n**Where to find it:** You can check it out on Amazon here:[https://www.amazon.in/dp/9349887207](https://www.amazon.in/dp/9349887207)\n\nI’ve poured a lot of experience regarding the pain points of deployment into this. I’d love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions you have about ONNX workflows or the book content!\n\nThanks!\n\n[Book cover](https://preview.redd.it/q5wo0ag5poag1.jpg?width=970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b76d4d84c9fa70e6630d1b776389623a75397afe)\n\n",

I must run my own EC2 instances for research, there's no other way.\n\nSo I wrote a simple daemon that watches nvidia-smi.\n\nIt’s not rocket science, but it’s effective:\n\n1. It monitors GPU usage every minute.\n2. If your training job finishes (usage drops compared to high), it starts a countdown.\n3. If it stays idle for 20 minutes (configurable), it kills the instance.\n\n**The Math:**\n\nAn on-demand H100 typically costs around $5.00/hour.\n\nIf you leave it idle for just 10 hours a day (overnight + forgotten weekends + \"I'll check it after lunch\"), that is:\n\n* $50 wasted daily\n* up to $18,250 wasted per year per GPU\n\nThis script stops that bleeding. It works on AWS, GCP, Azure, and pretty much any Linux box with systemd. It even checks if it's running on a cloud instance before shutting down so it doesn't accidentally kill your local rig.\n\nCode is open source, MIT licensed. Roast my bash scripting if you want, but it saved me a fortune.",

We’re going after people who just want their training job to run without becoming Ray experts first.\n\nDifferent markets really - Ray for ML engineers, us for researchers/beginners who want to skip the infrastructure parts entirely.\n\nHave you used Anyscale?

Your experience with having to redesign the entire stack later is exactly the kind of lesson that’s expensive to learn the hard way.\n\nYou’re absolutely right that Ray’s abstraction is powerful - write once, run anywhere from laptop to 1000 GPUs. And if we’re building orchestration that needs to scale, starting with Ray as the foundation makes way more sense than bolting on distributed later.\n\nThe differentiation would be more in the layer above Ray - instead of users learning Ray APIs and cluster management, they get the natural language interface that routes to Ray workloads under the hood. But you’re right that the underlying execution should be distributed-native from day one.\n\nI’d genuinely love to chat more about this. Your experience with both the technical implementation and the business realities is exactly what we need to hear. Happy to jump on a call if you’re interested - would love to get your perspective on where the real pain points are and how a Ray-based approach might solve them better.\n\nThanks for offering feedback - that kind of input from someone who’s actually built and scaled these systems is invaluable.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

So far, I’ve studied machine learning and DSA and have built a few basic projects. I have a decent grasp of ML fundamentals and I’m currently learning more about AI algorithms.\n\nIf there’s anyone who can guide me on how to approach advanced concepts and build more valuable, real-world projects, I’d really appreciate your help.",

There maybe some irrelevant sections for you so please weed out the required points.  \n\n\nTo be honest, there are effectively zero MLOps jobs for freshers in the industry right now. It is a relatively new field and it is almost entirely dominated by experienced DevOps engineers or data engineers who have pivoted.\n\nAs a fresher, breaking in as a backend/software engineer is a much more realistic path. You should focus on building full stack projects to get your foot in the door first.\n\nOnce you are hired, learn MLflow since it is the industry standard, or just master whatever tools your company is specifically using. The best way to get into MLOps is to slowly take on those responsibilities by showing initiative within a backend role.\n\nAs for cloud providers, there is no point in trying to learn all three. Most companies use AWS, so just focus on that. You can look at the AWS MLOps certification later if you want less friction while working in the field, but get the foundational experience first.\n\nYou need to be a Devops engineer first and then only you can be an Mlops engineer. And Devops is not a fresher's task, usually you do those tasks after about 1.5 years of experience in the same project.",

That way you will still do more research from your side and not take whatever I say at face value.\n\nIf you are a student who has no industry experience, please don't constraint yourself to MLOps. IMO MLOps is a skill and DevOps is the job. Now you said you liked the mathematics part, sorry to say if that is what interests you, you would find DevOps really boring.\n\nThe kind of roles you are looking for are ML engineer, AI engineer etc. In  these roles you would be using models created by people in research segment to solve problems for your organization. These roles require maths and ml/ai but not in the foundational sense. They require your applied  maths and ai chops to use those techniques for the company and not come up with new models or techniques as such. These roles will 100 percent require MLOps knowledge but you would be expected to handle these only after you have 2-3 years of exp.\n\nAs a green horn right of the block, focus on full stack dev and create projects related to full stack dev of AI based projects. Basically aim for a backend/full stack engineer in any company that uses a lot of AI for their core product offering (Not the one which use AI as tools, the ones that use AI as their main product offering like Amazon, AirBnB, Walmart etc).\n\nAs you gain exp you will 100 percent need to take on MLOps responsibilities, but right now you are not cut out for that.\n\nPlease keep asking your doubts.
