      "text": "We spent a few months now on a solution for dynamic model routing because we tried several things and nothing really solved our problem.\n\nThe core issue / our background: we deployed nodes with SLM and RAG to regulated industry teams (the problem is relevant in any setup though). But users couldn't figure out when to use which model (despite ongoing effort to educate). We tried static routing but the classification of queries upfront didn't really work as it was very unpredictable what the users were doing. Also the \"guessing\" part did not feel right, we iterated really a lot on this. So next we thought hybrid with big models would be the solution but somewhat similar we always had to estimate complexity before we saw output. The estimates missed often enough that we either overspent (like, radically, breaking our unit economics) or quality was bad from routing too aggressively to small models.\n\nWe found a Google publication (happy to share) that approaches this very differently, not routing but cascading. Start generating with the small model, validate quality as you go, escalate only if needed.\n\nWe developed this and open-sourced our implementation: [github.com/lemony-ai/cascadeflow](http://github.com/lemony-ai/cascadeflow)\n\nIt plugs into your existing infrastructure, works with LiteLLM, OpenRouter, n8n, LangChain, or direct API calls. From there you can use whatever models you want: OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, HuggingFace, local models via Ollama, self-hosted via vLLM.\n\nNot replacing your router or orchestration layer, just adding quality validation that decides when the cheap models output is actually good enough.\n\nSeeing 40-90% cost reduction in first production workloads and we are honestly quite excited. Would love feedback and happy to chat with others working on inference layers.",

Was going to be a researcher. One of my project profs in engineering Year 3 stressed that I try out startups before deciding on research.\n\nI interned at an analytics/ML startup that was in walking distance from my dorm (hostel), and continued the internship over the sem break. My manager insisted I sit with the full time employees and do some parts of their work with them.\n\nWithin a week I was running small scripts to clean and process data, write simple parsing logic etc. Googling -> doing. Had a lot of fun doing that. Super small team and a helpful manager made sure I was having fun in my internship and asked me to return back in year 4.\n\nMet the CEO. Decided to give the startup life a shot. A few years later I was interacting with the clients and attending meetings as a stand-in for the CTO, and it just clicked - I don't really care about ML; I care about building things that solve problems. ML just happened to be the tool I was most well versed in.\n\nLoved talking to people, looking and designing processes, cost computations, meeting clients, etc., and became a natural leader who knew how to bring the right people together to solve something, and how to solve a problem myself. I continued being good at coding, but it became less important in my last few years. Became the founding engineer and team lead, hired my own team and ran it like a mini startup for a few years.\n\nEventually I moved to FAANG after I had enough of the 0->1 phase. Enjoying it so far.\n\nCoding ability and passion is non negotiable. But if that's the only thing you bring to the table you're gonna get stuck being so good at your job that you can't be promoted or replaced.\n\nBuild systems, not just scripts. Become hard to replace because of how much of a force multiplier you are, but be smart enough to keep in touch with your core competencies so that if/when you need to change your employer you can choose to do so.",

I sat for the exam this today and passed! 🚀  \nI already had experience building agents with LangChain/OpenAI, but I quickly realized this exam requires a mindset shift. It’s less about generic Python loops and more about the \"NVIDIA Way\" (NIMs, Triton, NeMo).\n\n**The Results (The Good & The Ugly):**  \nI wanted to be transparent about the score breakdown because it tells a story:\n\n* **Platform Implementation:** 85% \n* **Deployment & Scaling:** 79%\n* **Safety, Ethics & Compliance:** ...35% 😅\n\n**My Takeaway:**  \nIf you are preparing, **do not sleep on the infrastructure**. The reason I passed is that I focused nicely on understanding **NIM microservices, Triton Inference Server, and Kubernetes scaling**. If I had relied only on my generic \"coding agents\" knowledge, I would have failed.\n\nAlso, Don't make my mistake—study the \"boring\" safety docs of safety, Ethics and Human in Loop Too!\n\n  \n**Rest assured, Ask me Anything about the exam and I will try my best to help** ",

      "text": "If you're transitioning into MLOps or ML Engineering from a different background (DevOps, backend, etc.), here's something I've learned the hard way:\n\n**Pick one or two ML domains and go deep.**\n\nWhy?\n\n1. **Every company has their own unique pipeline and infra.** There's no universal \"MLOps stack\" that everyone uses. What works at one company looks completely different at another.\n2. **Interviews have changed.** People rarely ask general theory questions anymore. Instead, they dig into the details of *your* projects — what decisions you made, what tradeoffs you faced, how you solved specific problems.\n3. **Being a generalist dilutes your value.** Applying to 100 places with surface-level knowledge across everything is less effective than targeting roles that match your specific ML or business interest and becoming genuinely expert in that space.\n\n**What do I mean by \"domains\"?**\n\nThink: Computer Vision, NLP, Recommender Systems, Time Series/Forecasting, Speech/Audio, etc.\n\nFor example, if you pick CV, you learn common model architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers), understand data pipelines (image preprocessing, augmentation), know deployment challenges (model size, latency, GPU serving), and build projects around it. Now, when you apply to companies doing CV work, you're not a generalist; you actually speak their language.\n\nAnd if you're coming from DevOps/infra like me, that's actually a **unique advantage**. Production infrastructure, scaling, reliability — these are the real problems ML teams are struggling with right now. Most ML folks can build models. Far fewer can deploy and operate them reliably.\n\nDon't undersell your background. Lean into it.\n\nI've helped a few folks navigate this transition, review their resumes, prepare for interviews, and figure out what to focus on.

I wanted to avoid the 1GB+ RAM footprint of Airflow while keeping observability. \n\nI finally finished the benchmarks.\n\n**The TL;DR:**\n\n* **Airflow/Kestra:** Both demand 1GB+ just to sit idle.\n* **Cronicle:** The winner my use case. 50MB RAM but gives you a full UI and audit trail.\n* **Ofelia:** The minimalist king at <10MB. Hard to audit.\n\n[A breakdown of the memory ‘entry fee’ for each orchestrator.](https://preview.redd.it/4ssqks7qr3gg1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=61531c5bbdc6b44817171a99af2cfa50c816cf2e)\n\nI documented the full methodology, the Python/Docker setup, and the raw CSV data in this write-up: [Orchestration Without the Bloat: Benchmarking 6 Lightweight Alternatives to Airflow](https://mgijon94.medium.com/orchestration-without-the-bloat-benchmarking-6-lightweight-alternatives-to-airflow-c68413ba699c)\n\nThe whole code can be found here: [Github repo](https://github.com/MGijon/Posts/tree/main/ETL-scheduler-docker-compose)\n\nMassive thanks to everyone here who suggested I look into the 'job-centric' model.

After running into *only paid tools or overly complicated setups* for turning web pages into structured data for LLMs, I built **Mojo,** a **simple, free, open-source tool** that does exactly that. It’s designed to be easy to use and integrate into real workflows.\n\nIf you’ve ever needed to prepare site content for an AI workflow without shelling out for paid services or wrestling with complex scrapers, this might help. Would love feedback, issues, contributions, use cases, etc. <3\n\n[https://github.com/malvads/mojo](https://github.com/malvads/mojo) (and it's MIT licensed)\n\n*Cheers!*",

I'm gathering insights on three specific \"pain points\" for research:\n\n1. If an agent takes 15 internal \"thought\" steps, and each takes 1.5s, that’s a 22-second wait. Does your churn spike at 5s? 10s? Or do your users actually wait?\n2. How much time does your team waste trying to refactor layers (like moving PyTorch → TensorRT) only to have the accuracy drop or the conversion fail?\n3. Are you stuck paying for H100s because cheaper hardware (L4s/T4s) just can't hit the TTFT (Time to First Token) you need?",

But I kept thinking - what if you could talk to your diagnosis? What if you could ask follow-up questions and drill down into specific issues?\n\nNow you can! 🚀\n\n🆕 What's New: Interactive Diagnostic Chatbot\n\nInstead of just receiving a static report, you can now launch a local chatbot web app to have back-and-forth conversations with an LLM about your model's diagnostic results:\n\n💬 Conversational Diagnosis - Ask questions like \"Why is my model overfitting?\" or \"How do I implement your first recommendation?\"\n\n🔍 Full Context Awareness - The chatbot has complete knowledge of your hypotheses, recommendations, and model signals\n\n📝 Code Examples On-Demand - Request specific implementation guidance and get tailored code snippets\n\n🧠 Conversation Memory - Build on previous questions within your session for deeper exploration\n\n🖥️ React App for Frontend - Modern, responsive interface that runs locally in your browser\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/leockl/sklearn-diagnose\n\nPlease give my GitHub repo a star if this was helpful ⭐",
