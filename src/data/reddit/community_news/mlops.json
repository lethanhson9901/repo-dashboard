      "text": "I've been in the ML/DevOps space for 11+ years and recently started doing 1:1 calls helping people transition into MLOps. One thing I keep noticing, almost everyone I talk to is overwhelmed.\n\nNot because they're not smart. But because MLOps is so vast, with batch vs. real-time ML pipelines, inference, infrastructure, and monitoring, every course teaches it differently. One guy will say start with Kubeflow, another says MLflow, another says forget tools, learn fundamentals first.\n\nI genuinely want to understand from this community:\n\n1. When you search MLOps on YouTube, what kind of videos do you actually watch fully? Tool-specific tutorials? Career roadmaps? Architecture walkthroughs?\n2. What's your biggest struggle right now — is it picking the right tools? Understanding how pieces connect end to end? Or knowing what the market actually wants vs what courses teach?\n3. Is there a video or channel that genuinely helped you \"get it\"? Not just theory, but actually made something click?\n4. What's missing? What video do you wish existed but doesn't?\n\nAsking because I see so much content out there, but people on my calls are still confused. \n\nSomething is clearly not working. Curious what you all think.\n\nI've been thinking of creating some content on this myself, but before that, I just want to understand the current situation and where people are really stuck. No point in adding more noise if the real gap is elsewhere.",

      "text": "Hey all — As the title says, looking for practical input from teams operating at a similar scale...\n\nWe have a small MLOps team supporting a small Data Science team... \\~4-6 per team. We’re enabling SageMaker + MLflow this year and trying to move toward more sustainable, repeatable ML workflows.\n\nHistorically, our ML efforts have been fairly ad hoc and home-grown. We’re now trying to formalize things and improve R&D velocity without overburdening either the DS team or our platform engineers.\n\nOne major constraint is that our DevOps/infra process is heavily gated. New AWS resources require approvals outside our teams and move slowly. So we’re trying to design something clean and safe that doesn’t require frequent new infrastructure or heavyweight process for each new model.\n\nI’m aware of the AWS-recommended workflows, but they seem optimized for larger teams or environments with more autonomy than we have.\n\nSome Additional Context:\n\n* Data lake on S3 (queried via Athena)\n* Models are often entity-specific (i.e., many model instances derived from a shared training pipeline)\n\nCurrent thinking:\n\n* Non-Prod:\n   * EDA + pipeline development + model experimentation\n   * read-only access to prod archive data to remove need to set up complicated replication from prod to non-prod\n* Prod:\n   * Inference endpoints\n   * Single managed MLflow workspace\n      * DS can log runs + register models (from non-prod or local)\n      * Only a prod automation role can promote models to “Production”\n      * Production Inference services only load models marked \"Production\"\n   * Automated retraining pipelines\n\nThoughts or suggestions on this setup?\n\nThe goal is to embed sustainable workflows and guardrails without turning this into a setup that requires large teams to support it.\n\nWould love to hear what’s worked (or failed) for teams in similar size ranges or if you have any good experience with AWS Sagemaker to suggest good workflows.",

      "text": "So my team has been pushing me to evaluate autonomous agents for some of our workflow automation. Specifically looking at OpenClaw since it has massive traction (something like 160k+ GitHub stars) and can connect LLMs to local files, browsers, Slack, Discord, etc. Our ops lead is really excited about using it to auto-triage the \\~200 support tickets we get daily, basically having it read incoming tickets, check our internal docs, and route them to the right team with a priority score. Also been talking about automating the data validation checks we run every Monday where someone manually compares CSV exports against our postgres tables. Tedious stuff that would be perfect for an agent.\n\nBut honestly? The more I dig into this, the more I want to pump the brakes.\n\nI stumbled across some security research that genuinely unsettled me. Apparently there are tens of thousands of OpenClaw instances just... exposed directly to the internet. But the number that really stopped me was this: something like 15% of community built skills contain malicious instructions. Prompts designed to download malware or steal data. And when these get flagged and removed, they apparently just reappear under new identities pretty quickly.\n\nThe project's own FAQ literally describes this as a \"Faustian bargain\" with no \"perfectly safe\" setup. I appreciate the honesty but also... what am I supposed to do with that? How do I bring this to my team without sounding like I'm just being obstructionist?\n\nWhat's frustrating from an MLOps perspective is that this completely changes how I think about threat modeling. We've spent so much time worrying about model poisoning, adversarial inputs, data drift. With agents though, the attack surface just explodes. Prompt injection could come through any email or webpage the agent processes. If someone compromises the agent itself they basically inherit every permission we've granted it. And the plugin ecosystem? Nobody has time to audit all that, but you're essentially running untrusted code with access to your systems.\n\nThere's also this concept I keep seeing called \"judgment hallucination\" where the agent appears trustworthy but lacks genuine reasoning, so users just... hand over more and more authority. That one hits different because I can already see how it would play out with some of the less technical folks on our team who already treat ChatGPT like its omniscient.\n\nI looked at some alternatives like AutoGPT and BabyAGI but they seem to have similar issues, maybe even less mature from a security standpoint. A coworker mentioned something called Agent Trust Hub that supposedly scans skills for hidden logic and data exfiltration patterns before you install them, still need to actually try it though. The usual advice seems to be run everything in containers, dont expose default ports, start with read only permissions and expand from there.

Your setup sounds really cool — abstracting the physical layer for non-OS hardware is no joke.\n\nOur approach is more cloud-first — we go through Qualcomm AI Hub's API for compilation and on-device execution, then wrap results in signed evidence bundles so CI gates can't be spoofed. Think \"unit tests but for model quality on real hardware.\"\n\nOn the accuracy variance — I think you're on the right track with the kernel implementations. Different Hexagon NPU generations (v69, v73, v75) likely use different fixed-point arithmetic paths. But it's probably a mix of that plus compiler-level graph optimizations varying per target, and possibly quantization calibration differences during compilation. We're also not pinning the runtime library version across devices yet, so that's another uncontrolled variable.\n\nHonestly, isolating *which* of these contributes *how much* is half the reason we built this.

It is like devops, it is about how to do things, not what things have to be done.\n\nIt is an approach, which still can be backed with specific tools, processes, skills, roles etc.\n\nYou do not transition into it in my opinion. It is more like you are an ML engineer or data scientist or infrastructure engineer or sulution architect or whatever. Even having a role named MLOps or Devops engineer is totally fine but your main tasks with regards to MLOps thinking is to support the reliability of services that are realized through Ai technologies (mostly ML as the name suggests).\n\nThen this comes down to you are doing machine learning or infrastructure work and you want to professionalize this even more.\n\nOne cannot say this often enough: MLOps is NOT FOR BEGINNERS\n\nDo all the other work that relates to it and after some years of experience you will realize what the important bits of the MLOps approach are. Also: MLOps is, like often times with other approaches, highly individual and has to be adapted for the setting / service / organization (factors could be size of service, number of people using the pipelines and many more)\n\nAnd: I really don't want to dampen your ambitions, but I think you'll find it easier if you don't view it as a dedicated profession, but rather as a task that must be fulfilled by everyone involved.
