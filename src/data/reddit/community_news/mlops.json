      "text": "In my last post, I covered ML foundations. This one's about Python, specifically, the gap between \"I know Python\" and the Python you actually need for MLOps.\n\nIf you're from infra/DevOps, your Python probably looks like mine did: boto3 scripts, automation glue, maybe some Ansible helpers. That's scripting. MLOps needs programming, and the difference matters.\n\n**What you're probably missing:**\n\n* **Decorators & closures** — ML frameworks live on these. Airflow's \\`@tasks\\`, FastAPI's \\`@app.get()\\`. If you can't write a custom decorator, you'll struggle to read any ML codebase.\n* **Generators** — You can't load 10M records into memory. Generators let you stream data lazily. Every ML pipeline uses this.\n* **Context managers** — GPU contexts, model loading/unloading, DB connections. The `with` Pattern is everywhere.\n\n**Why memory management suddenly matters:**\n\nIn infra, your script runs for 5 seconds and exits. In ML, you're loading multi-GB models into servers that run for weeks. You need to understand Python's garbage collector, the difference between a Python list and a NumPy array, and the GPU memory lifecycle.\n\n**Async isn't optional:**\n\nFastAPI is async-first. Inference backends require you to understand when to use asyncio, multiprocessing, or threading, and why it matters for ML workloads.\n\n**Best way to learn all this?** Don't read a textbook. Build an inference backend from scratch, load a Hugging Face model, wrap it in FastAPI, add batching, profile memory under load, and make it handle 10K requests. Each step targets the exact Python skills you're missing.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: you can orchestrate everything with K8s and Helm, but the moment something breaks *inside* the inference service, you're staring at Python you can't debug. That's the gap. Close it.\n\nIf anyone interested in detailed version, with an atual scenarios covering WHYs and code snippets please refer: [https://medium.com/@thevarunfreelance/friendly-advice-for-infra-engineers-moving-to-mlops-your-python-scripting-isnt-enough-here-s-f2f82439c519](https://medium.com/@thevarunfreelance/friendly-advice-for-infra-engineers-moving-to-mlops-your-python-scripting-isnt-enough-here-s-f2f82439c519)\n\nI've also helped a few folks navigate this transition, review their resumes, prepare for interviews, and figure out what to focus on.

Clear boundary. In MLOps, that boundary keeps breaking. One day, you're debugging why an inference service is leaking memory, or why a pipeline DAG is failing, and the answer isn't in the infrastructure; it's in the Python running on top of it.\n\nYou don't need to become a developer.

Tons of Python, and because we were working with lots of data, some real constraints in how we did things.

Dev capped at $50/day, requests stop when limit hits.\n\n**10% - Oversized context windows** Dumping 2500 tokens of docs into every request when 200 relevant tokens would work. Paying for irrelevant context.\n\nBetter RAG chunking strategy reduced this waste.\n\n**What actually helped:**\n\n* Caching layer for similar queries\n* Budget controls per environment\n* Proper context management in RAG\n\nCost optimization isn't optional at scale.

          "text": "I examined your diagram before I read the full post, and the two things that jumped out to me were 1) the arrows (presumably) triggering a training run with an API request and 2) the arrow going from the MLFlow tracking server to the deployment API. These correspond to your questions 1 and 3, so that is a good sign these could use some definition.\n\nFirstly, agreed that you want an orchestration layer for training. Dagster and Airflow are two common orchestration platforms, among others. Dagster has great k8s support. I haven’t used ZenML but a quick google search suggests to me it would also work fine for this. Asking AI for a comparison between these tools, given your requirements, would probably be fruitful. Regardless, this is all to say I think you’re right about needing something to orchestrate the training run. In your current diagram, for example, what exactly is hitting the endpoint? Some custom frontend? A curl command from your terminal? An orchestration framework allows you to schedule runs and/or manually trigger from a UI with your desired parameters.\n\nSecondly, the deployment process and trigger could use better definition. I personally use gitlab pipelines to build my custom model serving docker images with MLServer, and they get deployed via ArgoCD with the same CI/CD component any other non-ML app uses at my organization (I did need to write Helm charts for my MLServer deployments specifically). This pipeline could be triggered at the end of your training pipeline, or probably better you could use MLFlow aliasing/tags to fire a webhook for your deployment pipeline. But, fundamentally, building an image to serve your containers shouldn’t look functionally all that different from other build pipelines at your org, with the exception that ML containers can have some nasty dependencies and large artifact dependencies (model weights).\n\nLet me know if that all makes sense, or not.",

          "text": "Great architecture sketch — super critical to break things into distinct services early on.\n\nOn the orchestration question: since you're already on K8s and planning to extend to Slurm, you'll want something that abstracts away the infrastructure layer so your researchers aren't writing YAML all day. I've seen people have good experiences with Dagster and Kubeflow for this, but I'd also suggest taking a serious look at ZenML — full disclosure, I'm part of the ZenML team, so take this with the appropriate grain of salt.\n\nThat said, the reason I think it's worth evaluating here specifically is that ZenML was designed to be a framework-agnostic orchestration layer that plugs into the tools you're already using (MLflow, K8s, S3/MinIO) rather than replacing them. So you'd keep your MLflow tracking, your MinIO storage, your K8s cluster — ZenML just becomes the connective tissue that defines and runs your pipelines across all of it. It also plays nicely with the \"microservices\" mental model you're going for.\n\nA couple of non-ZenML-related thoughts too:\n\n* \\+1 to what others said about drift/skew detection — worth thinking about early even if you don't implement it in your MVP.\n* The comment about LakeFS over DVC is worth considering, especially at scale with large datasets and streaming use cases.\n* For the deployment side, I'd honestly keep it simple at first. Honestly for smaller models use MLflow serving or even wrap in in a FastAPI, and then graduate to more complex services later \n\nGood luck with the build — sounds like a fun project!",

          "text": "Hey, imo, the overall approach is fine. I also agree with most of the feedback others have left. Leaving some of mine:\n\n\\- Simply stitching services together might not be the hardest part. What really requires some thinking is making it secure. I.e. the whole authentication flow from data to infra to model/artifact registry to deployment. Your diagram doesn’t show any of this.\n\n\\- A few things are undefined in the diagram: there’s no clear data path from S3/MinIO into the actual training pods, the “Model Selection” arrow from MLflow to your Deployment Service has no trigger mechanism (manual? webhook? CI pipeline?), and Slurm is mentioned in the text but completely absent from the diagram with no abstraction layer between K8s and Slurm.\n\n\\- That yellow “Training Service API” box (job queue, state manager, scheduling, logs) is essentially an entire orchestration platform you’d be building from scratch. Worth thinking about whether you really want to own that.\n\n\\- Reconsider MinIO since the open-source project has been archived [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47000041](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47000041)\n\n\\- SkyPilot is really the way to go if you already have K8s and plan on adding Slurm into the mix. You write one task YAML and it works on both. When Slurm comes online you reuse existing task definitions instead of rewriting pipelines. Since the resources will be shared between team members, you’ll most likely need to deploy and manage the central SkyPilot API server.\n\n\\- SkyPilot also has SkyServe [https://docs.skypilot.co/en/stable/serving/sky-serve.html](https://docs.skypilot.co/en/stable/serving/sky-serve.html) for the deployment/inference side. Add a service: block to a YAML and you get autoscaling, load balancing, and rolling updates. Worth evaluating before building a custom deployment service.",

That's five places where lineage breaks.\n\nModelKits ([KitOps](https://kitops.org), CNCF Sandbox) fix this at the artifact layer. A ModelKit is an OCI artifact — same format as your Docker images — that packages weights, dataset refs, config, and code with a Kitfile manifest. You already run Harbor and MinIO. Harbor becomes your single registry for images, models, and datasets. No new infrastructure.\n\nWhat changes:\n\n**DVC → gone.** `kit pack` your datasets, push to Harbor. Versioning is OCI tags. No LakeFS either.\n\n**MLflow → experiment tracking only.** Drop MLflow Model Registry and MLflow deployment. Harbor + ModelKits is your registry. MLflow is great for experiment tracking UI and bad at everything else it tries to do.\n\n**Training orchestration → Argo Workflows.** CNCF graduated, K8s-native. Pipeline: `kit unpack` → train → `kit pack` → `kit push`. Stop building a custom Training Service API with job queues and state managers. That's a multi-year project you don't need.\n\n**Governance gate (you're missing this).** Between trained and deployed: run ModelScan, attach cosign attestations, tag as `:approved`. You're a research org managing lots of models — provenance isn't optional, and nobody in this thread mentioned it.\n\n**Deployment Service API → gone.** KitOps has a native KServe `ClusterStorageContainer` integration. KServe pulls ModelKits directly from Harbor via OCI reference. No artifact retrieval logic, no container initialization code. Point KServe at [`harbor.yourorg.com/models/my-model:approved`](http://harbor.yourorg.com/models/my-model:approved), done.\n\nYou're currently stitching together DVC + MLflow Registry + MLflow Tracking + Harbor + MinIO + two custom APIs and hoping they agree on what \"model v2.3\" means. That's a lot of coordination surfaces to keep in sync. With KitOps: Harbor is your single source of truth, Argo runs your pipelines, MLflow tracks your experiments. Three tools, each doing one job. And you get security and provenance your current architecture doesn't even attempt.",

Fraud systems usually live or die by features like velocity, such as how many times an IP appears in a short window, and device fingerprinting. For return abuse, you should talk about the feedback loop since labels often take weeks to arrive after a return happens. Make sure you can explain how to handle the extreme class imbalance since fraud cases are rare compared to normal orders.\n\nOn the architecture side, look into how graph databases help with identity linking. If a person uses multiple emails but the same device ID, a graph helps you find those connections quickly. You should also think about the trade offs between a real time blocking system and a batch based risk scoring system. The interviewer will probably ask how you plan to handle data drift when fraudsters change their patterns to avoid detection.\n\nI write about these kinds of engineering challenges in my newsletter, Machine Learning at Scale. I actually cover specific system design topics and production infrastructure over at [machinelearningatscale.substack.com](http://machinelearningatscale.substack.com) if you want to see some deep dives before your interview.

Always come up with ideas youself, bounce few times with \"freindly expert\", improve your design.

      "text": "If you are running LLM / RAG / agent systems in production, this might be relevant. If you mostly work on classic ML training pipelines (tabular, CV etc.), this map probably does not match your day-to-day pain points.\n\nIn the last year I kept getting pulled into the same kind of fire drills: RAG pipelines that pass benchmarks, but behave strangely in real traffic. Agents that look fine in a notebook, then go off the rails in prod. Incidents where everyone says “the model hallucinated”, but nobody can agree what exactly failed.\n\nAfter enough of these, I tried to write down a **failure map** instead of one more checklist. The result is a **16-problem map for AI pipelines** that is now open source and used as my default language when I debug LLM systems.\n\nVery roughly, it is split by layers:\n\n* **Input & Retrieval \\[IN\\]** hallucination & chunk drift, semantic ≠ embedding, debugging is a black box\n* **Reasoning & Planning \\[RE\\]** interpretation collapse, long-chain drift, logic collapse & recovery, creative freeze, symbolic collapse, philosophical recursion\n* **State & Context \\[ST\\]** memory breaks across sessions, entropy collapse, multi-agent chaos\n* **Infra & Deployment \\[OP\\]** bootstrap ordering, deployment deadlock, pre-deploy collapse\n* **Observability / Eval {OBS}** tags that mark “this breaks in ways you cannot see from a single request”\n* **Security / Language / OCR {SEC / LOC}** mainly cross-cutting concerns that show up as weird failure patterns\n\nThe 16 concrete problems look like this, in plain English:\n\n1. **hallucination & chunk drift** – retrieval returns the wrong or irrelevant content\n2. **interpretation collapse** – the chunk is right, but the logic built on top is wrong\n3. **long reasoning chains** – the model drifts across multi-step tasks\n4. **bluffing / overconfidence** – confident tone, unfounded answers\n5. **semantic ≠ embedding** – cosine match is high, true meaning is wrong\n6. **logic collapse & recovery** – reasoning hits a dead end and needs a controlled reset\n7. **memory breaks across sessions** – lost threads, no continuity between runs\n8. **debugging is a black box** – you cannot see the failure path through the pipeline\n9. **entropy collapse** – attention melts into one narrow path, no exploration\n10. **creative freeze** – outputs become flat, literal, repetitive\n11. **symbolic collapse** – abstract / logical / math style prompts break\n12. **philosophical recursion** – self-reference loops and paradox traps\n13. **multi-agent chaos** – agents overwrite or misalign each other’s roles and memories\n14. **bootstrap ordering** – services fire before their dependencies are ready\n15. **deployment deadlock** – circular waits inside infra or glue code\n16. **pre-deploy collapse** – version skew or missing secret on the very first call\n\nEach item has its own page with:\n\n* how it typically shows up in logs and user reports\n* what people usually *think* is happening\n* what is actually happening under the hood\n* concrete mitigation ideas and test cases\n\nEverything lives in one public repo, under a single page:\n\n* **Full map + docs:** [https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/README.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/README.md)\n\nThere is also a small helper I use when people send me long incident descriptions:\n\n* **“Dr. WFGY” triage link (ChatGPT share):** [https://chatgpt.com/share/68b9b7ad-51e4-8000-90ee-a25522da01d7](https://chatgpt.com/share/68b9b7ad-51e4-8000-90ee-a25522da01d7)\n\nYou paste your incident or pipeline description, and it tries to:\n\n1. guess which of the 16 modes are most likely involved\n2. point you to the relevant docs in the map\n\nIt is just a text-only helper built on top of the same open docs. No signup, no tracking, MIT license.\n\nOver time this map grew from my own notes into a public resource. The repo is sitting around \\~1.5k stars now, and several **awesome-AI / robustness / RAG** lists have added it as a reference for failure-mode taxonomies. That is nice, but my main goal here is to stress-test the taxonomy with people who actually own production systems.\n\nSo I am curious:\n\n* Which of these 16 do you see the most in your own incidents?\n* Is there a failure mode you hit often that is completely missing here?\n* If you already use some internal taxonomy or external framework for LLM failure modes, how does this compare?\n\nIf you end up trying the map or the triage link in a real postmortem or runbook, I would love to hear where it feels helpful, and where it feels wrong. The whole point is to make the language around “what broke” a bit less vague for LLM / RAG pipelines.",

Let SMEs flag real transcripts as “ideal,” “borderline,” or “fail,” and continuously sample from production logs for evaluation sets. That keeps nuance intact because it’s grounded in real behavior, not hypothetical test cases.\n\nI also think pair-review style workflows help. Domain expert defines the intent and failure boundaries. Engineer encodes it. Then both review eval drift over time. It becomes collaborative rather than translational.\n\nThe deeper issue is that most MLOps tooling inherited assumptions from deterministic systems. Agents are probabilistic and contextual. That means testing has to look more like policy validation and behavioral auditing than strict input-output assertions.\n\nCurious if you’re exploring tooling here or just noticing the gap. It feels like there’s space for much better human-in-the-loop eval design.",

A few levers that often help: keep-warm pools for the long tail, pin a smaller set of models per endpoint (or use an in-process router), move weights to local NVMe and aggressively cache artifacts, and separate preprocessing/postprocessing from GPU-bound inference so the GPU container stays hot. If you can, measure: cold start time, model load time, queueing, and actual GPU utilization. What’s your request interarrival distribution and max tolerated p95 latency?",
