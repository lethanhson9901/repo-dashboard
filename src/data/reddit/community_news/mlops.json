      "text": "Hi ML Leaders,  \n  \nI'm prepping for MLOps EM roles at FAANG/big tech + backups at legacy cos. But interviews seem split:  \n  \n1) SOP-hiring: Google & Meta, even \"MLOps\" JDs hit you with MLE-style system designs (classification/recommendation etc)  \n2) Team-oriented-hiring companies: Amazon/Uber/MSFT/Big Tech, more pure MLOps system design (feature stores, serving, monitoring, CI/CD).  \n3) Legacy (smaller/enterprise): Mostly general ML lead/director roles leaning MLE-heavy, few pure MLOps spots.  \n  \nDon't want to spread prep thin on two \"different\" system designs. How should I do to make sure to focus since the competition is high. Or any strategy or recommendation on double down on MLOps? How'd you balance? Seeking for experienced folks input.  \n  \nYOE: 13+ (non-FAANG)",

I just want to visualize my loss curve without paying w&b unacceptable pricing ($1 per gpu hour is absurd).\n\nThere's no way doing this is that hard. I would do it myself but am working on a different project right now.\n\nAlso aim is an open source alternative but it's not a drop in replacement and it's not hosted. I want to easily switch from wandb and neptune without losing quality UI, without hosting it myself, and without having to do a bunch of gymnastics to fit someone else's design patterns. It needs to be MIT license so that if you decide to sell out someone else can pick up where you left off. Please for the love of god can someone please create a mobile app so I can view my runs while on the go?\n\nedit: also there's [minfx.ai](http://minfx.ai) but their ui is terrible, why is it so hard to just clone wandb / neptune, the spec is there, someone please vibe code it lol",

That narrows the field a lot.\n\nA few thoughts, based on what I’ve seen work: Firstly, Docker Compose isn’t the problem, as cron-like schedulers *inside* Compose usually fail once you care about auditability and debugging. Ofelia is fine until the first “why did this fail last night?” incident. One pattern that works well in this middle ground is using a job-centric orchestrator instead of a DAG-centric one. You define jobs as containers/scripts, run them on demand or on schedules, and get logs + history per run, without standing up a full scheduler stack.\n\nThis is actually where tools like ClearML end up fitting better than people expect:\n\n* It runs comfortably in a single-node / Docker Compose setup.\n* Jobs are just containers or scripts, so it feels closer to cron/supervisord than Airflow.\n* Every run gets logs, status, artifacts, and retries by default (huge for ETL debugging).\n* When you move to k3s, you’re not rewriting logic; you’re just changing where agents run.\n\nThe key difference vs Airflow is that you’re not modeling complex DAGs upfront. You’re tracking and scheduling *executions*, which matches an MVP phase much better.\n\nIf you want something even lighter, some start with:\n\n* simple cron + structured logging + metadata\n* then graduate to something like ClearML once failures/debugging start to hurt\n\nThat way you’re not locking yourself into Airflow semantics before you actually need them.\n\nTL;DR: you’re right to avoid Airflow right now. Look for something that treats jobs as first-class, gives you observability out of the box, and doesn’t care whether it’s running under Compose or k3s. That’s the real middle ground.",

It works great in testing. You ship it to production. For the first few weeks, it's solid. Then:\n\n* A model or RAG gets updated and behavior shifts\n* Your evaluation scores creep down slowly\n* Costs start climbing because of redundant tool calls\n* Users start giving conflicting feedback and explore the limits of your system by handling it like ChatGPT\n* You need to manually tweak the prompt and tools again\n* Then again\n* Then again\n\nThis cycle is exhausting. Given there are few data science papers written on this topic and all observability platforms keep blogging about self-healing capabilities that can be developed with their products, I’m feeling it's not just me.\n\nWhat if instead of manually firefighting every drift and miss, your agents could adapt themselves? Not replace engineers, but handle the continuous tuning that burns time without adding value. Or at least club similar incidents and provide one-click recommendations to fix the problems.\n\nI'm exploring this idea of connecting live signals (evaluations, user feedback, costs, latency) directly to agent behavior in different scenarios, to come up with prompt, token, and tool optimization recommendations, so agents continuously improve in production with minimal human intervention.\n\nI'd love to validate if this is actually the blocker I think it is:\n\n* Are you running agents in production right now?\n* How often do you find yourself tweaking prompts or configs to keep them working?\n* What percentage of your time is spent on keeping agents healthy vs. building new features?\n* Would an automated system that handles that continuous adaptation be valuable to you?\n\nDrop your thoughts below.

          "text": "Totally agree. Visibility alone often isn’t the blocker; the harder problem is turning those signals into actionable insights like “what change improves outcomes and cost with the least risk.”\n\nIn my experience, tools that capture complete agent traces plus per-step cost, latency, and behavior patterns (not just logs) make it much easier to classify failure modes and cluster similar incidents before touching prompts. Debuging/tracing like vLLora helps here by making every decision path visible end to end.\n\nWhat I find especially interesting is the next step: building an agent that works *on top of those traces*. Instead of reacting manually, it can group recurring failure paths, correlate them with eval drift or cost spikes, and then propose specific deltas such as prompt changes, tool constraints, or routing tweaks. You can validate those changes on a small eval slice before shipping anything.\n\nCurious how you think about automated adaptation in practice. Would you prefer a system that only suggests fixes with human review, or one that can apply small changes autonomously under strict guardrails?",

              "text": "Love this take. You're spot on that visibility isn't the bottleneck anymore, it's the actionability gap. Most teams I worked with have great traces and metrics, and with manual effort they are able to even translate those into “safe, small deltas” that actually move performance or cost in the right direction without regressions. The real unlock, as you said, seems to be building a layer on top of those traces, metrics, and user behavior, one that detects patterns, clusters recurring failures, and proposes fixes that are both measurable and reversible. Less human dependent analysis and more human reviewed auto-optimization.\n\nOn your question: I’m leaning toward a hybrid approach for adaptation. To optimize a black box, last thing we want, is another black box. 😄 IMO, early-stage systems need a “co-pilot mode” that suggests deltas with explainability and clear diff previews (like, “reduce retrieval top-k from 8 → 5 to cut cost by 12%, confidence 0.8”), and over time, once confidence thresholds and rollback mechanisms prove reliable, move toward limited auto-apply under guardrails. I am also getting inspired by the concept of backtesting from algorithmic trading. Whatever optimization the system comes up with should have some proof associated that it will work.\n\nHow have you seen “safe autonomy” handled in similar setups, have you experimented with closed-loop systems that make micro-tuning adjustments live automatically?",

We’ve been working on an agent that optimizes LLM requests by analyziing traces and then running controlled experiments on variations in a guided way. In practice it’s mostly “co-pilot/cursor way” today: it proposes small deltas like prompt trims, tool-call schema changes or retrieval parameter changes, then we validate on a replay set or a small eval slice before rolling anything out. We’ve been cautious about full closed-loop changes in production, but the goal is to gradually earn autonomy for narrow, reversible optimizations with clear rollback and measurable impact.",

You prioritize which metrics matter, it iterates and shows reasoning. Not fully autonomous but cuts the manual tweaking significantly.\n\nHonest take: full self-healing is hard. You still need human judgment for major changes. But automating the continuous tuning (config tweaks, parameter adjustments, identifying failure patterns) saves tons of time.\n\nTo your questions - most teams we work with spend like 40% of time maintaining agents vs building new stuff.

Continuous firefighting takes time without always yielding lasting improvements.\n\nIn my experience, building systems to monitor metrics like latency, cost creep, and model drift in real time can help set threesholds that alert developers when adjustments are needed not after issues are seen. Sometimes, an automated adaptation system makes a lot of sense here rather than manual checks. If such a tool could aggregate signals like user feedback, evaluation scores, and cost spikes to suggest optimization strategies (versus manual tweaking), it could significantly improve runtime stability but can become costly. \n\nHow do you currently prioritize and triage these issues? Are there frameworks helping you already like LangChain for tool selection or custom monitoring dashboards?",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a junior ML engineer, I have 2 years experience so I’m not THAT experienced and especially not in this.\n\nI’ve been asked in my current job to design some sort of data lake to make the data independent from our main system and to be able to use this data for future projects in ML.\n\nTo give a little context, we already have a whole IT department working with the “main” company architecture. We have a very centralized system with one guy supervising every in and out, he’s the one who designed it and he gives little to no access to other teams like mine in R&D. It’s a mix of AWS and on-prem.\n\nEverytime we need to access data, we either have to export them manually via the software (like a client would do) or if we are lucky and there is already an API that is setup we get to use it too.\n\nSo my manager gave me the task to try to create a data lake (or whatever the correct term might be for this) to make a copy of the data that already exists in prod and also start to pump data from the sources used by the other software. And by doing so, we’ll have the same data but we’ll have it independently whenever we want.\n\nThe thing is I know that this is not a simple task and other than the courses I took on DBs at school, I never designed or even thought about anything like this. I don’t know what would be the best strategy, the technologies to use, how to do effective logs….\n\nThe data is basically a fleet management, there are equipment data with gps positions and equipment details,  there are also events like if equipment are grouped together then they form a “job” with ids, start date, location… so it’s a very structured data so I believe a simple sql db would suffice but I’m not sure if it’s scalable.\n\nI would appreciate it if I could get some kind of books to read or leads that I should follow to at least build something that might not break after two days and that will be a good foundation long term for ML.",
