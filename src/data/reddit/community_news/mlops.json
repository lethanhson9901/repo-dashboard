      "text": "I've been interviewing for MLOps and ML Platform Engineer roles over the past few months, and I wanted to share some observations that might help others make a similar transition.\n\n**The Interview Gap**\n\nMost interviewers I've faced come from research or pure ML engineering backgrounds. They think in terms of model architectures, feature engineering, and training pipelines. If you're coming from a pure infrastructure or DevOps background like me, there's often a disconnect.\n\nYou talk about Kubernetes orchestration, GPU cluster management, and cost optimisation. They ask about data drift, model retraining strategies, or how you'd debug a model's performance degradation. The conversation doesn't flow naturally because you're speaking different languages.\n\n**What Actually Helped**\n\nI realised I needed to invest time in **ML fundamentals** – not to become a data scientist, but to bridge the communication gap. Understanding basic statistics, how different model types work, and what \"overfitting\" or \"data leakage\" actually mean made a huge difference.\n\nWhen I could frame infrastructure decisions in ML terms (\"this architecture reduces model serving latency by X%\" vs \"this setup has better resource utilisation\"), interviews went much more smoothly.\n\n**Be Strategic About Target Companies**\n\nNot all MLOps roles are the same. If you're targeting companies heavily invested in **real-time inferencing** (think fraud detection, recommendation engines, autonomous systems), the focus shifts to:\n\n* Data distribution and streaming pipelines\n* Low-latency prediction infrastructure\n* Real-time monitoring and anomaly detection\n* Data engineering skills\n\nIf they're doing **batch processing and research-heavy ML**, it's more about:\n\n* Experiment tracking and reproducibility\n* Training infrastructure and GPU optimization\n* Model versioning and registry management\n\nMatch your preparation to what they actually care about. Don't spray-and-pray applications.\n\n**MLOps Roles Vary Wildly**\n\nHere's something that actually helped my perspective: **MLOps means different things at different companies**.\n\nI've had interviews where the focus was 90% infrastructure (Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring). Others were 70% ML-focused (understanding model drift, feature stores, retraining strategies). Some wanted a hybrid who could do both.\n\nThis isn't because teams don't know what they want. It's because MLOps is genuinely different depending on:\n\n* Company maturity (startup vs established)\n* ML use cases (batch vs real-time)\n* Team structure (centralised platform vs embedded engineers)\n\nIf an interview feels misaligned, it's often a mismatch in role expectations, not a reflection of your skills. The \"MLOps Engineer\" title can mean vastly different things across companies.\n\n**Practical Tips**\n\n* Learn the basics: bias-variance tradeoff, cross-validation, common model types\n* Understand the ML lifecycle beyond just deployment\n* Be able to discuss model monitoring (not just infra monitoring)\n* Know the tools: MLflow, Kubeflow, Ray, etc. – but more importantly, know *why* they exist\n* Read ML papers occasionally – even if you don't implement them, you'll understand what your ML colleagues are dealing with\n\n**Final Thought**\n\nThe transition from DevOps to MLOps isn't just about learning new tools. It's about understanding a new domain and the people working in it. Meet them halfway, and you'll find the conversations get a lot easier.\n\nKeep learning, keep iterating.\n\nIf anyone's going through a similar transition and wants to chat, feel free to DM or connect here: [https://topmate.io/varun\\_rajput\\_1914/](https://topmate.io/varun_rajput_1914/)",

How should I do to make sure to focus since the competition is high. Or any strategy or recommendation on double down on MLOps? How'd you balance?

We have a very centralized system with one guy supervising every in and out. It’s a mix of AWS and on-prem.\n\nEverytime we need to access data, we either have to export them manually via the software (like a client would do) or if we are lucky and there is already an API that is setup we get to use it too.\n\nSo my manager gave me the task to try to create a data lake (or whatever the correct term might be for this) to make a copy of the data that already exists in prod and also start to pump data from the sources used by the other software. And by doing so, we’ll have the same data but we’ll have it independently whenever we want.\n\nThe thing is I know that this is not a simple task and other than the courses I took on DBs at school, I never designed or even thought about anything like this. I don’t know what would be the best strategy, the technologies to use, how to do effective logs….\n\nThe data is basically a fleet management, there are equipment data with gps positions and equipment details,  there are also events like if equipment are grouped together then they form a “job” with ids, start date, location… so it’s a very structured data so I believe a simple sql db would suffice but I’m not sure if it’s scalable.\n\nI would appreciate it if I could get some kind of books to read or leads that I should follow to at least build something that might not break after two days and that will be a good foundation long term for ML.",

What matters more for ML is: having reproducible snapshots of data, knowing which model trained on which version, avoiding manual exports long-term\n\nif you want something outside SQL that still works well for ML, a common choice is an object-store “lake”:\n\n* Land raw data as files in S3 (or MinIO on-prem), partitioned by date/entity (e.g., events/date=.../, gps/date=.../).\n* Use a table format like Delta Lake / Apache Iceberg / Apache Hudi on top so you get versioning + schema evolution + time travel (super helpful for reproducible training datasets).\n* Query it later with Trino/Athena/Spark when needed, without locking yourself into one database.\n\nThe hard parts aren’t scale, they’re ingestion, schema changes, and data ownership. Start with append-only ingestion from prod (even on a schedule), keep it boring, and design for traceability first.\n\nIf you build something reliable and reproducible, you’ll have a solid ML foundation, you can always optimize later.",

Data ia not extracted and 'voila\" ready to use, there is likely mane steps inbetween.\nYou are risking:\n1. Redoing work that has already been done by another team\n2. Training your models on data that does not represent an already established and potentially evolving truth. Effectively building a shadow data platform will in the long run not be beneficial for you or the company\n\nSo my advice would be to:  \n* Focus your efforts on building a bridge between your team and the centralized data team, and trying to get the data you need from the centralized platform. I know this might take time and managers want quick results. But doing this is better in the long run. Moreover, you should be able to get support from your manager and higher stakeholders on this approach. As an ML engineer you cannot be starved of the data you need. Try doing this in parallel to starting your \"shadow data lake\" if you really need quick results.\n* From this data build a feature store, and advice like using Open Table Formats like delta or iceberg that support time travel is a nice to have and not a MUST at the beginning.",

Slurm said `Priority`, but it turned out to be a specific partition constraint hidden in the config that wasn't documented.  \n  \nIs it just our setup, or is debugging distributed training a nightmare for everyone? What tools are you guys using to actually see *why* a node is failing? `scontrol show job` gives me nothing.\n\n>",

          "text": "Slurm error logs are essentially an Information Black Hole. When a job is stuck on Pending, the \"Priority\" label is often a mask for a hard partition constraint or a hardware mismatch. Distributed training requires more than just job status; it requires real-time monitoring of NCCL state and hardware metrics. If you’re manually grepping slurmd logs on random nodes, you’re playing a game of whack-a-mole that Slurm was never designed to help you win.",
