      "text": "We run ML systems in production. LLM API costs hit $3,200 last month. Actually analyzed where money went.\n\n**68% - Repeat queries hitting API every time** Same questions phrased differently. \"How do I reset password\" vs \"password reset help\" vs \"can't login need reset\". All full API calls. Same answer.\n\nSemantic caching cut this by 65%. Cache similar queries based on embeddings, not exact strings.\n\n**22% - Dev/staging using production keys** QA running test suites against live APIs. One staging loop hit the API 40k times before we caught it. Burned $280.\n\nSeparate API keys per environment with hard budget caps fixed this. Dev capped at $50/day, requests stop when limit hits.\n\n**10% - Oversized context windows** Dumping 2500 tokens of docs into every request when 200 relevant tokens would work. Paying for irrelevant context.\n\nBetter RAG chunking strategy reduced this waste.\n\n**What actually helped:**\n\n* Caching layer for similar queries\n* Budget controls per environment\n* Proper context management in RAG\n\nCost optimization isn't optional at scale. It's infrastructure hygiene.\n\nWhat's your biggest LLM cost leak? Context bloat? Retry loops? Poor caching?",

In a lot of systems, the LLM becomes the most expensive cache miss you’ve ever deployed.\n\nContext bloat has been the biggest leak I’ve seen. Teams over index on “just give it more docs” instead of tightening retrieval quality. A sloppy RAG pipeline quietly doubles or triples spend because nobody notices incremental token creep.\n\nRetry loops are another hidden killer. Especially with agents. If you allow automatic retries with minor rephrasing and no cap, you can burn a ton of tokens on what is basically the same failure mode repeated three times.\n\nOne pattern that helped us was aggressive observability at the token level. Logging prompt tokens, completion tokens, and tool calls per request, then ranking endpoints by cost per successful outcome. When you frame it as cost per resolved task instead of cost per call, waste becomes obvious.\n\nAlso agree hard on environment separation. Using production keys in staging is basically handing your burn rate to a test script.\n\nCurious if semantic caching caused any weird edge cases with slightly different intent but similar phrasing? That’s usually where people get nervous.",

These correspond to your questions 1 and 3, so that is a good sign these could use some definition.\n\nFirstly, agreed that you want an orchestration layer for training. Dagster and Airflow are two common orchestration platforms, among others. Dagster has great k8s support. I haven’t used ZenML but a quick google search suggests to me it would also work fine for this. Asking AI for a comparison between these tools, given your requirements, would probably be fruitful. Regardless, this is all to say I think you’re right about needing something to orchestrate the training run. In your current diagram, for example, what exactly is hitting the endpoint? Some custom frontend? A curl command from your terminal? An orchestration framework allows you to schedule runs and/or manually trigger from a UI with your desired parameters.\n\nSecondly, the deployment process and trigger could use better definition. I personally use gitlab pipelines to build my custom model serving docker images with MLServer, and they get deployed via ArgoCD with the same CI/CD component any other non-ML app uses at my organization (I did need to write Helm charts for my MLServer deployments specifically). This pipeline could be triggered at the end of your training pipeline, or probably better you could use MLFlow aliasing/tags to fire a webhook for your deployment pipeline. But, fundamentally, building an image to serve your containers shouldn’t look functionally all that different from other build pipelines at your org, with the exception that ML containers can have some nasty dependencies and large artifact dependencies (model weights).\n\nLet me know if that all makes sense, or not.",

I've seen people have good experiences with Dagster and Kubeflow for this, but I'd also suggest taking a serious look at ZenML — full disclosure, I'm part of the ZenML team, so take this with the appropriate grain of salt.\n\nThat said, the reason I think it's worth evaluating here specifically is that ZenML was designed to be a framework-agnostic orchestration layer that plugs into the tools you're already using (MLflow, K8s, S3/MinIO) rather than replacing them. So you'd keep your MLflow tracking, your MinIO storage, your K8s cluster — ZenML just becomes the connective tissue that defines and runs your pipelines across all of it. It also plays nicely with the \"microservices\" mental model you're going for.\n\nA couple of non-ZenML-related thoughts too:\n\n* \\+1 to what others said about drift/skew detection — worth thinking about early even if you don't implement it in your MVP.\n* The comment about LakeFS over DVC is worth considering, especially at scale with large datasets and streaming use cases.\n* For the deployment side, I'd honestly keep it simple at first. Honestly for smaller models use MLflow serving or even wrap in in a FastAPI, and then graduate to more complex services later \n\nGood luck with the build — sounds like a fun project!",

          "text": "Hey, imo, the overall approach is fine. I also agree with most of the feedback others have left. Leaving some of mine:\n\n\\- Simply stitching services together might not be the hardest part. What really requires some thinking is making it secure. I.e. the whole authentication flow from data to infra to model/artifact registry to deployment. Your diagram doesn’t show any of this.\n\n\\- A few things are undefined in the diagram: there’s no clear data path from S3/MinIO into the actual training pods, the “Model Selection” arrow from MLflow to your Deployment Service has no trigger mechanism (manual? webhook? CI pipeline?), and Slurm is mentioned in the text but completely absent from the diagram with no abstraction layer between K8s and Slurm.\n\n\\- That yellow “Training Service API” box (job queue, state manager, scheduling, logs) is essentially an entire orchestration platform you’d be building from scratch. Worth thinking about whether you really want to own that.\n\n\\- Reconsider MinIO since the open-source project has been archived [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47000041](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47000041)\n\n\\- SkyPilot is really the way to go if you already have K8s and plan on adding Slurm into the mix. You write one task YAML and it works on both. When Slurm comes online you reuse existing task definitions instead of rewriting pipelines. Since the resources will be shared between team members, you’ll most likely need to deploy and manage the central SkyPilot API server.\n\n\\- SkyPilot also has SkyServe [https://docs.skypilot.co/en/stable/serving/sky-serve.html](https://docs.skypilot.co/en/stable/serving/sky-serve.html) for the deployment/inference side. Add a service: block to a YAML and you get autoscaling, load balancing, and rolling updates. Worth evaluating before building a custom deployment service.",

That's five places where lineage breaks.\n\nModelKits ([KitOps](https://kitops.org), CNCF Sandbox) fix this at the artifact layer. A ModelKit is an OCI artifact — same format as your Docker images — that packages weights, dataset refs, config, and code with a Kitfile manifest. You already run Harbor and MinIO. Harbor becomes your single registry for images, models, and datasets. No new infrastructure.\n\nWhat changes:\n\n**DVC → gone.** `kit pack` your datasets, push to Harbor. Versioning is OCI tags. No LakeFS either.\n\n**MLflow → experiment tracking only.** Drop MLflow Model Registry and MLflow deployment. Harbor + ModelKits is your registry. MLflow is great for experiment tracking UI and bad at everything else it tries to do.\n\n**Training orchestration → Argo Workflows.** CNCF graduated, K8s-native. Pipeline: `kit unpack` → train → `kit pack` → `kit push`. Stop building a custom Training Service API with job queues and state managers. That's a multi-year project you don't need.\n\n**Governance gate (you're missing this).** Between trained and deployed: run ModelScan, attach cosign attestations, tag as `:approved`. You're a research org managing lots of models — provenance isn't optional, and nobody in this thread mentioned it.\n\n**Deployment Service API → gone.** KitOps has a native KServe `ClusterStorageContainer` integration. KServe pulls ModelKits directly from Harbor via OCI reference. No artifact retrieval logic, no container initialization code. Point KServe at [`harbor.yourorg.com/models/my-model:approved`](http://harbor.yourorg.com/models/my-model:approved), done.\n\nYou're currently stitching together DVC + MLflow Registry + MLflow Tracking + Harbor + MinIO + two custom APIs and hoping they agree on what \"model v2.3\" means. That's a lot of coordination surfaces to keep in sync. With KitOps: Harbor is your single source of truth, Argo runs your pipelines, MLflow tracks your experiments. Three tools, each doing one job. And you get security and provenance your current architecture doesn't even attempt.",

Practice tests from itexamscerts also played a big role, they helped me identify weak areas and improve my confidence before the exam. Overall, if your basics are clear, the exam is very manageable.\n\nNow I’m preparing for NVIDIA NCP-AII, and I would really appreciate guidance from those who have cleared it.\n\n\\* How tough is it compared to NCA-AIIO?\n\n\\* Is it more hands-on or CLI/lab focused?\n\n\\* Any recommended labs?y\n\nI look forward to your valuable insights.

Let SMEs flag real transcripts as “ideal,” “borderline,” or “fail,” and continuously sample from production logs for evaluation sets. That keeps nuance intact because it’s grounded in real behavior, not hypothetical test cases.\n\nI also think pair-review style workflows help. Domain expert defines the intent and failure boundaries. Engineer encodes it. Then both review eval drift over time. It becomes collaborative rather than translational.\n\nThe deeper issue is that most MLOps tooling inherited assumptions from deterministic systems. Agents are probabilistic and contextual. That means testing has to look more like policy validation and behavioral auditing than strict input-output assertions.\n\nCurious if you’re exploring tooling here or just noticing the gap. It feels like there’s space for much better human-in-the-loop eval design.",

I’m trying to prep hard in the time I have.\n\n# What I’m looking for:\n\n**1.

          "text": "Since you only have four days, focus on feature engineering and latency. Fraud systems usually live or die by features like velocity, such as how many times an IP appears in a short window, and device fingerprinting. For return abuse, you should talk about the feedback loop since labels often take weeks to arrive after a return happens. Make sure you can explain how to handle the extreme class imbalance since fraud cases are rare compared to normal orders.\n\nOn the architecture side, look into how graph databases help with identity linking. If a person uses multiple emails but the same device ID, a graph helps you find those connections quickly. You should also think about the trade offs between a real time blocking system and a batch based risk scoring system. The interviewer will probably ask how you plan to handle data drift when fraudsters change their patterns to avoid detection.\n\nI write about these kinds of engineering challenges in my newsletter, Machine Learning at Scale. I actually cover specific system design topics and production infrastructure over at [machinelearningatscale.substack.com](http://machinelearningatscale.substack.com) if you want to see some deep dives before your interview.

Always come up with ideas youself, bounce few times with \"freindly expert\", improve your design. Get interviewer to ask questions about your choices. \n\nSince it's ML System Design I'd maybe focus on broader picture of typical ML system:\n\n- how do you collect historical data\n\n- how do you classify it for training\n\n- how would you extract features from your data\n\n- features engineering for training\n\n- features engineering for inference\n\n- model performance evaluation (a/b testing)\n\n- maybe take a look at industry's tooling like Hopworks Feature Store and MLFlow.\n\n- make sure you understand \"big picture\" of your ML system and maybe can dive deep into details.\n\n- finally, always keep in mind that it is OK for you to say \"sorry I never looked into this aspect in details\".

In document pipelines I’ve seen prompt drift caused not only by wording changes but also by upstream dependency shifts (model version updates, temperature defaults, tokenizer changes).\n\nHave you considered versioning execution context separately from prompt text? That’s often where reproducibility breaks down.",

They might have gotten better, but basically it was solving a similar problem but within the existing MLFlow framework. Ie, you had to have an instance, and the experiment tracking format they used could get tricky with anything off HF. Basically you're tied not only to their tools, but their storage and formatting.\n\nI like how lightweight this is - it lets the user decide how they want to track and store this data, but also can be used as a one-off in notebooks. Looking forward to trying this out.",

So far, I've been using a bit of dummy data, but it would be great if anyone would help me understand where to get some real data from.  \nI don't have compute to run a lot of DL experiments. If anyone has any logs lying around, or knows where I can find some, I'd be grateful if they can share.",
