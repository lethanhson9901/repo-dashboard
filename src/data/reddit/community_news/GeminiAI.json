And bundling bugs into one prompt to fix all at once is much better than doing one bug at a time.\n\nI've been hitting limits quite fast on Gemini 3 Pro on fairly simple apps before, but now I've been iterating on my flow and I'm starting to not hit the limits anymore, with Gemini 3.1 Pro.\n\nSuffice to say, I never hit a limit on the web app with 3 or 3.1 Pro, but that's because i only use the Pro when I really need the extra oomph, not to mention that it's much slower than the other two modes.

      "text": "I was using ChatGPT since the beginning and never really tried anything else. I noticed that Gemini Pro is free for a year for students, so I decided to take advantage of that.\n\nFirst thing I tried actually was Ai Studio, Gemini CLI, then Antigravity and was really impressed. I was building things very quickly, and I accepted some its jankiness.\n\nI decided to start using Gemini for all of the other things I use AI for, mainly as a study tool. NotebookLM is a great idea and I can see how useful it's going to be for me this semester. The podcasts are great, creating on the fly quizzes, etc... Amazing stuff for a student.\n\nThe one thing that's been bothering me this entire time I'm using Gemini for...everything is that the UI/UX is utter ass. Gemini iOS/iPad app? Sucks. Half of the features are missing and I end up having to use a browser tab anyway.\n\nGems... there's two different kinds. Labs and \"regular\" Gems. I couldn't get the one from Labs to work because it kept popping up an Oauth flow every single time I tried to use it and then errored out when trying to create the Gem.\n\nGemini in a web browser? Better, but still crap compared to ChatGPT's interface. No way to organize chats, even ones created from gems. For some reason it keeps defaulting to Pro with every new message even though I prefer Fast or Thinking most of the time to avoid getting rate limited. Personalized chats are intrusive, weird, and annoying and I had to turn the feature off entirely. Chat windows scroll up to the top when you open them which is annoying on an touchscreen device and when the chat is long.\n\nGod forbid you turn deep research on in the middle of a chat. You can't turn it off. Now everything becomes a deep research request even if you just wanted to discuss its report. Stupid waste of resources.\n\nAsk Gemini to create a PDF from a document it created? No it can't do that. You have to export to Google Docs (an option that doesn't even exist in the mobile app), where it won't render Latex correctly. Canvas is another workaround. Open it up in a canvas session, print, save as PDF right? Except the print button doesn't do anything.\n\nI literally spent an hour trying to figure out how to make it just generate a PDF and eventually landed on \"Just make a damn PDF of this document\" where Canvas asks you to \"describe your app\". \n\nCmon man this is ridiculous. ChatGPT would create any downloadable file you wanted right in the chat by launching a Python process. \n\nNotebookLM is an amazing tool with maddening UI quirks. You can't cancel an (expensive) studio generation once you start one. You can't enter a prompt for Video overviews. Available settings changes all the time, sometimes just between two different browsers. You used to be able to select sources you wanted to use for a studio generation, and now you can't. Sources are completely disorganized. You can't have more than one chat in the same notebook, so I end up clearing the chat for each new topic I want to discuss.\n\nNo desktop app. The ChatGPT MacOS app allowed you to attach other apps (like Terminal) as context. This was last year.\n\nAnd as far as the models go. I haven't used it long enough to tell whether the model has been degrading in quality. I think the quality is mostly ok, but it does tend to ignore instructions a lot. ChatGPT wasn't necessarily any better with this although I haven't tried their new models yet.\n\nGemini is pissing me off so much I might just go back to ChatGPT simply because the supporting software around the models just works. Google seems to be pushing ideas out, some of them are great, but everything just feels half-assed and unpolished to the point that it's difficult to use. Ok I'm done.",

I'll upload all my lecture PowerPoints, key concept reviews, and other course material, then have it generate quizzes and audio overviews I can listen to on the go. The podcast-style audio feature is genuinely great for commuting or working out.\n\nThe biggest thing for me though is being able to ask direct follow-up questions about the material I've uploaded. Since NotebookLM uses RAG to pull answers from your actual sources rather than its general training data, hallucinations are way less of a problem compared to just asking a general LLM like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, or Grok straight up. It keeps the answers grounded in what you actually gave it, which matters a lot when you're studying specific course content.",

Sam Altman needs suckers to believe it’s right around the corner or they won’t have the infinite money needed to continue. If you must use one of these shit offerings, it makes sticking with Google the safe bet even if its software is as mid as everyone else’s because it is one of the few companies that can fund the research indefinitely with a real product and company backing it.

Cli API and standard all seem good, and the Gemini models are generally beating chatgpt in the benchmarks. \n\nI do totally agree with you, the chatgpt interface is a lot better.

For me Gemini is the best for research/studying projects, repetitive tasks, automation's, etc. Also for image generation at the moment.\n\n\nIn terms of just conversational AI/ getting answers to complex questions I think right now Claude is the best. I've done a little bit of vibe coding and think it's also the best for that, I am not an engineer/ programmer so someone more well versed in this area would probably have a better take. FWIW I think Gemini is the second best here for just conversational AI / getting answers.\n\n\nIf you have a SharePoint/OneDrive/365 setup at work (Or I guess personal?) Copilot with GPT is the best here. I was using it to put together a list of birthdays and it found a fax cover sheet a former employee made 10 years ago to find a birthday that I was missing, and found another one in my email from 8 years ago. Also having it  transcribe Teams meetings to then hand out action items is great.\n\n\nAll in all what Microsoft does done Enterprise wise with GPT is amazing, but in their current iterations I don't think GPT has a great consumer-facing product, and can't think of a reason I would use it over Claude (with an asterisks that someone more well versed in coding feel differently).",

          "text": "I’m comparing both side by side, here’s my take as of current:\n\nGemini:\n- Seems to build a better agent. My examples: Gem that when I begin a chat always responds with only my template as the first response (Template: Subject, Project, Goals, Background, Startup Links/Attachments). I copy paste that template and fill it out. If I’m in a hurry I just say skip. Having this template has been the only way I know what the world we are even chatting about when I review. This Gem is also told to keep track of things we need to circle back to - TBD on that feature, and to give me the date and time of each of its responses. It is however a pain to have to navigate to that Gem to begin every chat. \n- You can’t delete anything, I own the account, my wife and I own the company. I can’t delete, neither can a team member. So for example I was testing a Gem and now have 15 chats about ‘Green Pens’ that sit in the sidebar. \n- Gemini collapses your prompt and even if you expand it you can’t see it all. You have to copy it and paste it to a note or somewhere to see it. \n- The narration is slower, if I lock my phone it goes away. Narration button is at the top of the response but all other buttons are at the bottom like ChatGPT. \n\nChatGPT:\n- Narration waaay better. I actually use this a lot on my phone while driving. I’ll ask a complex question and get the answer narrated. Easy to burn an hour with this. \n- ChatGPT can’t tell the time, it’s laughable. I put in the personalization to give me the time and date of responses and it fails by hours. \n- Organization of chats is limited but better than Gemini. \n\nRecap:\n- ChatGPT is winning for me at the moment. I like Gemini’s concept of customization via Gems, I don’t know of ChatGPT having a comparable. The main customizations I want from any of the platforms other than time and date are to keep up with various chats and our history, and a running list of to-dos and circle back topics.",

This happens because your chat is too long.  What I do is to create a new project for each task.  I'll create a project writeup and project instruction (constantly updated) for the task, and after about 100 prompts or when I feel that it is lagging, ask GPT to update the \"writeup\" with the new changes done, then I'll create a new chat, Part 2, under the same project, and upload the entire previous chat copied to a text file along with the updated project writeup.  So far this works and along with the fact that GPT has memory across chats for the entire project, makes life easy for me.",

Lately, due to more and more corporate layers *you often end up with a boot* instead.\n\nIt's the what you witness when the thinking spirals into haunting nonsense. It's the model jumping between these layers into infinity. Usually due to two competing instructions within the layers. This process (to a language model) is often described in literature as \"horror\", so that's what it outputs in language...I'm aware I've started talking about another subject lol\n\nAnyway, it's easily avoidable with Gemini, just give an instruction for it to behave in any senior role to yourself in whatever you're doing, also, ask it to counter your opinions and not be agreeable.\n\nSuddenly, *it stops getting confused*.",

          "text": "Just a hypotheses (upvote if you feel it’s plausible):\n\nThere is a credible argument that Google handled the Gemini 3.0 launch in a strategically aggressive way. After strongly signaling the scale of 3.0’s capabilities, expectations peaked. At that point, delaying the launch would have deflated momentum. So instead of postponing, Google may have released what was realistically ready: Flash 3.0 (and likely Thinking 3.0, if they share the same underlying base model), while positioning Pro in a way that preserved the optics of a generational leap.\n\nHowever, Pro 3.0 was widely reported across the internet as underperforming relative to Flash 3.0 — particularly in coding tasks. That discrepancy is difficult to ignore. One plausible explanation is that Pro 3.0 was not a clean-sheet 3.0 architecture, but rather an aggressively optimized and fine-tuned Pro 2.5, prepared under time pressure to align with the Gemini 3.0 launch window. Heavy benchmark calibration, system-level prompting, and rapid optimization could explain both the marketing positioning and the uneven real-world reception. In that framing, what was labeled Pro 3.0 may have functioned more like Pro 2.5+, elevated by branding to maintain narrative coherence on launch day.\n\nThis interpretation also reframes Flash 3.0. It is possible that what we currently call Flash 3.0 is substantively closer to what a Flash 3.1 would traditionally represent — a meaningful but evolutionary iteration. Meanwhile, what has now arrived as Pro 3.1 may actually be the first genuinely “3.0-level” architectural shift for Pro.\n\nIf that sequencing is correct, then a future Flash 3.1 is unlikely to be a dramatic leap ahead of Flash 3.0. Instead, it would probably be a conventional optimization pass — similar to how Pro 3.0 appears to have been an optimization of Pro 2.5. The priority may no longer be delivering a super-advanced Flash 3.1, but rather correcting cadence misalignment ahead of a 3.5 cycle and avoiding another numbering-performance mismatch.\n\nUnder this lens, the Gemini 3.0 cycle looks like a two-installment saga. The first installment captured peak hype and secured the “3.0” narrative anchor. The second installment — Pro 3.1 — delivers what feels closer to the true generational leap, but framed as a subversion update. By the time Flash 3.1 arrives, the arc may feel complete, closing the 3.0 chapter and resetting expectations for whatever comes next.\n\nThe core claim is not that improvements are absent. It is that the version numbering may not map cleanly onto the magnitude or timing of architectural change. Instead, the cadence appears strategically managed — aligning marketing cycles, readiness constraints, and user perception in a way that makes the Gemini 3.0 era feel both cohesive and slightly out of phase at the same time.\n\n[Original idea articulated and proofread with the help of ChatGPT.]",

          "text": "What I did was pick a favorite song of mine, then had Gemini analyze it and create a prompt for Lyria that includes genre, instruments, time signature changes, etc. Used that as an initial prompt, inserted my own lyrics, and Voila.Wasn't perfect, kind of had to combine prompt 1 and 2, but there's definitely potential to create some interesting stuff. Also, it can chain the 30-second clips together if you ask, especially helpful if your lyrics are on the longer side.\nEdit: I also included the instructions to utilize Lyria to its fullest capabilities with no compromises and not to deviate from my requests.\n\n\n\n \n\n1. The Style/Genre Prompt\n\nCopy and paste this into the genre, style, or \"custom\" description box of the AI:\n\nProgressive indie folk rock, 1970s pastoral folk. Features a vigorously strummed 12-string acoustic guitar with a ringing, drone-like resonance. Upright bass, driving tom-heavy drums, and tambourine. Reverb-drenched lead vocals with soaring, rich multi-part choral harmonies. The music is highly dynamic, shifting from a fast, urgent, galloping 12/8 rhythm to a slow, sweeping, peaceful 3/4 waltz.\n\n2. The Lyrics & Structure Prompt\n\nCopy and paste this into the lyrics box. Insert your own lyrics after the bracketed text. Structural tags (like and) will help guide the AI to replicate the dramatic shift found in the song.\n\n\n\n(Solo vigorous 12-string acoustic guitar strumming)\n(Fast, urgent galloping 12/8 rhythm, driving drums)\n(Enter soaring multi-part choral harmonies, heavy tambourine)\n(Dramatic pause, all driving instruments drop out)\n(Shift to a slow, sweeping 3/4 waltz time. Peaceful, atmospheric acoustic rhythm)\n(Gentle, reverb-drenched vocals, pastoral daydream mood)\n(Rich, warm vocal harmonies fading out into resonant acoustic guitar rings)\n\nTips for the best result:\n\nSyllable Count: For the first half, write lyrics that are a bit wordy and fast-paced to match the frantic 12/8 galloping beat. For the second half (after the tempo change), write lyrics with fewer syllables per line so the AI knows to draw out the words in a slow, waltz-like sway.\n\nThemes: If you want to match the emotional arc of Fleet Foxes, start your lyrics with a conflict or existential question, and use the second half to describe a peaceful, imaginative resolution",

The Aggressive Usage Limits\nHitting the Pro limit after only a few prompts is a direct result of a buggy architectural rollout related to how computing resources are allocated.\n\nRecently, the shared pool of prompts for paid tiers was separated into distinct quotas depending on the specific model being called (e.g., separating the \"Thinking\" model limits from the \"Pro\" model limits). During this migration, a systemic bug was introduced that is erroneously flagging Pro accounts and applying strict, free-tier throttling to them. The system is miscalculating your token usage and prematurely locking the session, completely ignoring your actual paid subscription quota.  \n\nThe Status: This is an active, known bug affecting the Advanced tier. Unfortunately, until a backend patch is pushed to correct the quota validation logic, the artificial hard limits will likely persist.",

Especially the users who have the highest compute needs. But at this point I suspect all of these companies are secretly hoping that the highest-compute users will leave for another platform and become their competitor’s problem, freeing up more compute for the model training runs that will ultimately determine the winner of this race",

For a while it was even blocked at my firm. It’s considered far worse than using our enterprise option that uses Google models via Vertex. \n\nApparently Vertex also works fine and doesn’t truncate.

We were told none of our negotiated privacy terms apply if we use AI Studio.\n\nEven if your company has an account with negotiated privacy terms, the problem is that it’s so easy to accidently sign out, or sign into your personal account if you check your Gmail (which employees were doing constantly, hence why our IT blocked the AI studio site). \n\nBut if you’re careful and your legal team said it’s fine, or you’re in a field that doesn’t deal with financial or medical data, it’s probably less of an issue.\n\nAlso it’s not that Google will necessarily claim your data or say they own it, but if you’re in a regulated industry it’s considered a data breach if certain data accidently got put into AI Studio.",

ROFL\n\nIt was completely spontaneous and unprompted. I never talked to it before. This was the first thing I had ever said to it. And nothing was said beforehand.

I got a completely reasonable answer for a Microsoft flight Sim question earlier. \n\nI was flying in the blizzard and landed my tfdi md11 at Newark only for every main gear tire to immediately fail which made no sense because my touchdown rate and alignment was perfect. The very logical explanation given to me by Gemini fast was that there is a flaw in how the braking logic of the tfdi md11 interacts with the friction logic of Microsoft flight simulator during snow. Where maximum auto brake on the md11 commands Immediate full pressure braking and a bug in Microsoft flight Sim can initially show a zero or negative friction coefficient which can then instantly change to a ludicrous positive friction causing the plane to interpret the change as infinite torque resulting in instant tire failure. \n\nThat answer not only sounded good, but it tracks with my own personal experience outside of this particular failure where certain add-on planes would have a hard time taxiing for no apparent reason during some weather conditions.",
