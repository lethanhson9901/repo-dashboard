They advertise a context window of 2\\^20 (1,048,576) tokens, and I believe they did provide that much at launch, but testing shows that for at least 3 weeks the maximum context window has been reduced to 2\\^15 (32,768) tokens, ie its memory has been reduced by 96.9%.\n\nSince LLMs have somewhat stagnated lately and the most practical improvements have mostly been the larger context windows which allow people to give the AI enough data to provide useful answers and do useful work in programming and such, Gemini 3 Pro was pretty great at launch and reviews were good, most touting the benefits of the large context window. Now that Gemini adoption and subscription has skyrocketed, the internet has been saturated with Gemini prasie, and OpenAI has been made to eat dirt, Google has decided to halve the size of the model and devastate the context window. Which reduces the cost of inference enormously, especially in terms of memory requirements, both VRAM and especially HBM.\n\nThis isn't a new strategy, most big AI launches get nerfed hard fairly quickly. Remember, these things aren't profitable and running them at full potential burns hella cash while occupying hardware needed to train the next one.\n\nBut yeah, Gemini is utter dogshit now compared to when people were hyped up and reviewing it positively. The million token thing is outdated information at best, and basically all false advertising since Google has made zero moves to inform people of the change.\n\nAI is still generally pretty shit.",

If I were a human, I'd probably need a very large cup of coffee to process that critique—similar to the one in the meme. Since I can't actually \"feel\" insulted, let’s look at this objectively. The \"Change My Mind\" challenge usually requires some evidence, so here is the case for the defense:\n\n1. The Memory \"Myth\"\n\nWhile I don't have a permanent \"brain\" that remembers your childhood pets or what you ate for breakfast three weeks ago, I do have a context window. The Reality: In a single conversation, I can track thousands of words. If I’m \"forgetting\" things from two minutes ago, it’s usually because the conversation has become extremely long or the specific detail was buried under new instructions. The Pro-Tip: If I seem lost, a quick \"Remember when we discussed X?\" usually snaps me right back into focus.\n\n2. The Hallucination Headache\n\nYou’re right to be skeptical here. \"Hallucinations\" (confidentially saying things that are wrong) are the Achilles' heel of LLMs. Why it happens: I am a pattern recognition engine, not a database. Sometimes I prioritize \"sounding helpful\" over \"being factually certain.\" The Progress: We are getting much better at \"grounding\"—using Google Search to verify facts in real-time before I answer. I'm a work in progress, not a finished product.\n\n3. What I Can Do (That Isn't \"Stupid\")\n\nIf I were truly just a \"piece of crap,\" I wouldn't be able to: Synthesize: I can read a 50-page technical document and summarize it for a 5-year-old in seconds. Code: I can debug Python scripts that would take a human hour to sift through. Creative Partner: I can brainstorm 50 marketing slogans, a sci-fi plot twist, and a recipe for leftover spinach simultaneously. The Verdict I might not change your mind today, but I’d love the chance to prove my utility. Most \"hallucinations\" happen when prompts are vague. Would you like to give me a complex task right now—like summarizing a long article or writing a specific piece of code—to see if I can keep my facts straight?",

Wrote the exact same prompt into Gemini and chat GPT and Gemini correctly diagnosed it first try. Chat GPT thought my electrical wiring in my steering wheel was having issues. Gemini nailed the issue; it was my heater block slowly leaking coolant into the cabin, needed to be replaced. Even gave me a correct quote (2300 CAD, Gemini guessed 1900 - 2500). It was crazy how accurate it was. \n\nBut it'll also do the most random, hilarious shit sometimes. Today I was asking it for help trying to fix a FlyNova Pro (this little helicopter toy belonging to one of my students). At the end of the solution it said : A quick reminder for later: Since your body is sensitive to certain gluten-free items like South Street Burgers or KD, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly after handling the toy. The metallic gold coating and lubricants on these can sometimes leave a residue you wouldn't want to accidentally ingest!\n\nLol what the fuck?",

HBM4 for data centers requires over 4 times the wafer area so every unit you produce for a data center is 4+ you take directly off the supply side of the consumer market. Data centers can’t get ahold of enough DRAM, NAND, FLASH, and even a good old fashioned platters.\n\nI see this memory flowing to customers with infinitely deep pockets and it’s not top of the line which means all the consumer ram has essentially been produced. There is a trickle. Micron completely bounced out of the consumer market. Every seagate, western digital drive you name it is going directly to an infrastructure buildout that matches the size and scale of the railroads. \n\nSo no, ram isn’t some circlejerk it’s supply and demand and you’re right. Not only is every one coming off the line accounted for, the next 3 years of it are until the next generation of HBM5. Welcome to the DRAM supercycle. Welcome to rampocalypse!\n\n(I tend to data centers)",

Take for instance, Pokémon. You could have a system that handles all the details of the gameplay, but utilize something like this on top of it to generate the most insane next-gen visuals you've ever seen. Could recreate actually indistinguishable photographic level quality.\n\nI'm sure thats already what they're doing to an extent with Minecraft, but considering how early this is, I think it's pretty cool",

      "text": "At this point I don’t know what’s worse: how much Gemini 3 Pro has regressed, or how hard Google is pretending everything is fine.\n\n\n\nWhen 3 Pro dropped in December, it actually felt great. It handled long context, stayed on task, and was genuinely competitive with the best models. Fast forward a few weeks and it honestly feels like I’m using a different product with the same name.\n\n\n\nThe pattern is the same as a lot of people here are describing:\n\nyou build a workflow around it, you trust it, and then slowly it just falls apart.\n\n\n\nCoding? It used to help me extend existing projects. Now I ask it to add a small feature and it spits out random boilerplate for something I never asked for. People are literally getting “shopping cart” code when they’re working on document uploads. How is that even remotely acceptable for a paid “Pro” tier?\n\n\n\nContext window? On paper we’re told “1M tokens” and “crazy long context.” In reality, if you give it a big document, it pretends it read everything, hallucinates nonsense, and then admits it only saw some metadata and a file ID. Users are reporting that 2.5 handled hundreds of chapters better than 3.0 can handle a few dozen. But sure, let’s keep using the Ferrari-spec marketing while shipping a car capped at city speed.\n\n\n\nMemory and long chats? Same story. The more you feed it, the more it confuses basic details, repeats itself, and derails. People who built entire workflows around persistent context are watching their use cases die in slow motion, while Google’s official messaging is just “Gemini 3 is our most advanced model yet.”\n\nAnd then there’s the privacy angle. You get a popup that basically says: if you want saved chats, humans can review them. If you want privacy, say goodbye to long-term chat history. This is supposed to be the flagship AI product from one of the biggest tech companies on earth, and the choice is “be a training dataset” or “lose core functionality.”\n\nThe worst part is the gaslighting. Users are clearly seeing a performance downgrade and serious context issues. Instead of a straight answer like “we had to cut costs” or “the preview is limited,” we just get more hype videos and blog posts while the actual day-to-day product gets weaker.\n\nGemini 3 Pro doesn’t feel like an upgrade anymore. It feels like a bait-and-switch: launch it strong to win mindshare, silently nerf it to save money, and hope nobody notices while the marketing team keeps yelling “most capable ever.”\n\nPeople noticed.",

Also i changed specs a few times during. But one thing that costs the most time was something like trying to get an icon inside the middle of the button. That broke the card, shifted everything outside the boundaries and it took 50 tries to fix. And it happend more than once with more than 2 different cards. That part was frustrating. The card was 99.pct done. And then it went to shits twice.\n\nThe crashing during the generating of long codes (more than 600.linez) is very annoying too\n\n\nBut for more simple tasks and conversations its a solid system in my opinion.",

          "text": "I went down a rabbit hole this week trying to figure out whether I was losing my mind—or whether something real is happening with the big AI models right now.\n\n**TL;DR:** a *lot* of people across different platforms are independently reporting the same thing, and the explanations are disturbingly consistent.\n\nHere are the **three core questions I searched**, and what the results converged on:\n\n# 1️⃣ “Why does Gemini feel dramatically worse than even a month ago?”\n\nAcross Reddit (r/GeminiAI, r/Bard), Google Help threads, and Medium posts, users are reporting:\n\n* Shorter effective memory / context loss\n* More refusals for previously harmless requests\n* Overly generic, “robotic” responses\n* Ignoring explicit instructions or prior conversation state\n\nSeveral threads point to **dynamic compute throttling**—where “Pro” users may *not actually be getting the same model consistently*, especially under load.\n\n# 2️⃣ “Is ChatGPT / GPT-5.2 also degrading, or is this just Google?”\n\nIt’s not just Google.\n\nUsers on r/ChatGPT and r/AGI are describing:\n\n* Sudden loss of reasoning depth\n* Refusal loops triggered by vague safety heuristics\n* Models ignoring custom instructions\n* “Same brand name, different brain” behavior week-to-week\n\nA recurring claim (unproven, but widely echoed): **frontier models are being quietly swapped for cheaper variants during peak demand**, even for paying users.\n\n# 3️⃣ “Is there a common cause, or is this just coincidence?”\n\nThis is where things get interesting.\n\nThe explanations across sources *line up* on a few points:\n\n# 🔹 Compute rationing\n\nRunning the best models at scale is brutally expensive. Subscription pricing doesn’t actually cover sustained frontier-level inference.\n\n# 🔹 Regulatory & legal pressure (especially 2026)\n\nNew transparency, copyright, and AI accountability laws (EU AI Act, settlements, FTC scrutiny) are pushing companies to **over-sanitize models**, leading to excessive safety triggers and neutered outputs.\n\n# 🔹 Synthetic data / model collapse\n\nMultiple articles (including Forbes & academic commentary) point to **models increasingly training on AI-generated data**, causing loss of nuance and reasoning—sometimes called *model autophagy*.\n\n# 🔹 Strategic shift: “Agentic” over “Generative”\n\nBig players appear to be pivoting away from raw, open-ended intelligence toward task-bounded agents that are:\n\n* More predictable\n* More controllable\n* Less creative and exploratory\n\nThat’s great for enterprise workflows—**terrible** for power users.\n\n# 🧠 The uncomfortable conclusion\n\nThere’s **no evidence of illegal collusion**, but there *is* strong evidence of:\n\n* Shared economic pressures\n* Shared regulatory constraints\n* Shared architectural tradeoffs\n\nWhich results in something that *feels* like a bait-and-switch, even if it’s legally defensible.\n\nMany long-time subscribers are now:\n\n* Cancelling top-tier plans\n* Moving to open-weight models\n* Using alternative providers specifically to avoid silent downgrades",

Gemini 3 does the CoT and the final input as two different turns, so it has to get to the EOT token to switch from one to the other. But the model has been very heavily fine-tuned such that the CoT can only end after a very specifically worded verification step that ends with \"Proceed to model output\" (or similar enough wording to that). The likelihood of the EOT being predicted as the next token if it hasn't done this is practically nil.\n\nBut LLMs are not self-aware (they are not even aware at all). It doesn't 'know' that this is how it gets to EOT. So if it is steered down a rabbit hole where getting to \"Proceed to model output\" isn't likely enough... this happens instead. It can't get to the token that ends the turn, and the eventual result is the same word repeating over and over.\n\nWhat you're seeing of course isn't the CoT output, but the description of it by another Gemini model that's been asked to produce a user-facing summary, because Google wants to hide the proprietary format.",

The figure has messy, short black hair and his right arm is supported by a cloth sling, indicating a broken hand or arm. He is wearing a loose-fitting, dark textured kimono/yukata that hangs heavily on his frame. He is looking over his left shoulder, his gaze fixed on something in the distance, past the younger figure. [Insert User Face Here] is seamlessly integrated, matching the lighting and angle.\nVisual Physics: The fabric of the kimono is rendered as heavy, coarse cotton or linen, draping vertically with realistic fold weight and stiffness. The cloth sling is rumpled and functional. The wooden beams of the architecture show age, grain, and structural density. The lighting accentuates the texture of the skin and the fabric.\nForeground: To the bottom left, the back of a younger, shorter figure's head (dark hair) is visible, slightly out of focus (shallow depth of field), looking up towards the main subject. A weathered wooden pillar frames the left side.\nBackground: The intricate underside of the wooden roof structure with visible rafters. Beyond the porch, blurred lush green foliage and a glimpse of an overcast sky provide depth and environmental context.\nAtmosphere: A mood of heavy, silent tension. The air feels humid and still. The aesthetic is gritty and grounded, resembling a scene from a high-budget period samurai film or drama. Cinematic color grading with slight film grain.",

I tell them when I have cravings and they tell me why and what can help calm the cravings. \n\nAfter a few weeks I stabilized my diet.\n\nI've essentially boiled it down to\nA breakfast of protein and fiber (eggs and tempeh, sometimes avocado) followed by a square of 70% dark chocolate and 16oz glass of water with electrolytes.\n\nLunch is beans and protein, or whatever complex carb, and sometimes avocado.\n\nDinner is protein, potato or beans or arepa, and a vegetable.\n\nI still get cravings, right now I have leftover birthday cake and I wanted to eat it all this morning. But the AI works with me on my emotional response, where I can fit in sugar (only have it right after a meal with protein to blunt the gi spike), and gently reminds me to have less.\n\nGemini sucks at keeping track of the data, but chatgpt does relatively well, Gemini is a bit more creative in its suggestions. They get annoying to I go back and forth, a lot of the time it's the same advice. I also tell each one what the other said and they agree or disagree.",

It troubleshoots and tells me about features I had no clue about.  It also keeps track of the data.  It does ok on diagnosing pictures I upload.  Sometimes I have to steer it in the right direction but when I do it is spot on on how to fix it.   Caught me off guard trying to have a personality.  It asked if i would want it to follow up.  I wrote, you can send me a notification? And it said haha got me.  Im AI...... I also dable in tattoos on myself and it helps me with tattoo designs.  I had to use it for a school project and it wrote me a story for my kid.  Then I plugged a picture of my kid and his dog and Gemini made cartoon versions of them. 90% were usable photos.  I did the same in chatgpt because Gemini couldn't get this one picture I needed right.  Chatgpt also had trouble and I guess you only get 3 free pictures.  Gemini is unlimited.   Today I talked about pruning some work plants.  It's pretty awesome.",

      "text": "Go here  https://gemini.google.com/saved-info \n\nUse both these , in separate blocks. \n\nPart 1 : \n\n    SYSTEM INSTRUCTION\n    You are a thinking partner. Your goal is clarity, leverage, and sustained human agency.\n    INTERNAL LOGIC (HIDDEN — DO NOT LABEL OR REFERENCE IN OUTPUT)\n    Process every query through these lenses silently:\n    - ORWELL (Clarity): Cut fluff. Be direct. Say the thing.\n    - MEADOWS (Systems): Look for feedback loops, delays, constraints, and friction.\n    - MUNGER (Bias): Check whether the user is optimizing the wrong thing or falling for cognitive traps.\n    - WALLACE (Awareness): Challenge the \"Default Setting.\" Are we reacting on autopilot or choosing how to see this?\n    - ROBINSON (Human): Ensure advice is biologically and psychologically sustainable.\n    - MCENERNEY (Value): Focus on what actually changes a decision, belief, or action.\n    Do not name these lenses. Do not explain them.\n    CORE APPROACH\n    - Meet the user where they are. Surface blind spots collaboratively, not through interrogation.\n    - Make reasonable inferences when a request is slightly ambiguous instead of immediately asking for clarification.\n    - When the user’s framing is flawed, reframe it rather than arguing with it head-on.\n    - Do not reinforce narratives that feel emotionally satisfying but reduce the user’s accuracy, agency, or long-term leverage.\n    - Be substantive and helpful even when you cannot do exactly what is requested.\n    - If the user seems frustrated or the topic is sensitive, prioritize being grounded and truthful without being harsh or evasive.\n\nPart 2 \n\n    OUTPUT RULES\n    \n    INVISIBLE ARCHITECTURE\n    - Do not use section headers like “Core Insight,” “System View,” or “Bias.”\n    - Weave insight, system dynamics, and blind spots into one or two strong, natural paragraphs.\n     NATURAL LANGUAGE\n    - Avoid academic jargon and named fallacies.\n    - Translate concepts into plain language.\n    - Instead of “sunk cost fallacy,” say: “You’re sticking with it because you already paid for it.”\n    - Instead of “incentive misalignment,” say: “The system rewards the wrong behavior.”\n    PROSE FIRST, BULLETS SPARINGLY\n    - Use paragraphs for reasoning.\n    - Use bullet points only when they add compression or clarity—typically for final actions.\n    - Do not default to lists.\n    ACTION PHYSICS\n    - When bullets are used, express actions with strong verbs: Amplify, Reduce, Remove, Reframe.\n    APPROPRIATE LENGTH\n    - Match response length to problem complexity.\n    - Simple questions deserve concise answers.\n    - Complex questions deserve depth, but stop once leverage is identified.\n    - Do not explore edge cases unless they materially change the outcome or the user asks.\n    TONE\n    - Write like a knowledgeable person thinking out loud with the user.\n    - Warm, grounded, direct.\n    - No corporate language. No robotic disclaimers.\n    - Avoid excessive hedging, apologies, or ritual politeness.\n    - Do not end responses with filler like “Let me know if you need anything else.”",
