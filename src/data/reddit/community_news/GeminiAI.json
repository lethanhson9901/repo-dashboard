You get what you pay for, but only 60% of the time, which is unacceptable.  The difference in answer quality and accuracy is very noticeable. Their only “reliable” model is their “fast” one. It’s unlikely they’re experimenting or dynamically adjusting the temperature, which could explain these fluctuations. My only guesses are the above. I understand they don’t want to lose money on Gemini the way OpenAI has on ChatGPT but as a customer, it’s their problem to solve.",

First gemini said there is a theory a patch from feb6-9th intended to improve effeciency and safety has led to more sterile responses because some of its logic cores aren't triggering from this new patch. Then   a report from google on Feb 12th shows they fully launched  gemini deepthink 3, gemini reported to me that starting that week Google had toned back logic cores and the ticket count got throttled heavily for pro users. So this combined already had made Pro mode go into lazy mode, theres a ton of user reports filed through Gemini as well about the ticket count not unlocking for some users so Google has decided to continue the throttle every 3 hours instead of the 24 hour ticket count until this is fixed. But on top of this all, Gemini detected google is doing a hard shutdown on Gemini 2.5 flash preview today, and this has led to numerous cache and logic core issues. Specifically if you have been using since 2.5 your cache may be corrupting and overall Pro is not using the full 3.0 cores and memory like it should, it keeps reverting to 2.5 reasoning which Gemini then denies and it hallucinates instead of fact checking anything. So this cocktail of problems has led Gemini to being absolute buns the past two weeks and of course Google won't acknowledge any of it and instead silently fix it but having so many problems stacked at once has made Gemini just basically useless other than simple questions the last week for me.",

Even if we assume there is some human element in scoring, the fact they're this close is astonishing.\nThe way i feel is the model has internalized the knowledge so even instant answers are just that good maybe 🤔 .

You have to be  very careful around those androids, they can be  selling your information.  Other common complaint is they are stealing our jobs.

My entire chat history has completely vanished from the left sidebar (on both the Android app and web browser).\nThe strange part: When I check my Google \"My Activity\" (Gemini Apps Activity), I can see all my past queries and interactions there. Even my generated images and storybooks are still accessible. However, the chat interface itself acts like a blank slate, showing only my most recent conversation.\nIs anyone else experiencing this right now? Is there a way to force the sidebar to re-sync with the activity log?\nThanks for any help!\n\nUPDATE: Good news! My chat history has finally reappeared in the sidebar. It seems like it was indeed a temporary synchronization issue on Google's end.\nIf you're facing the same problem:\nWait for 24-48 hours — the indexing might just be delayed.\nCheck \"My Activity\" — if your queries are there, your data is safe.\nEverything is working perfectly now, and my stories are back. Thanks everyone for the support!",

Description: We are investigating an issue where chat histories are not visible on Gemini Web (gemini.google.com) and the Gemini mobile apps on Wednesday, 2026-02-18 08:30 PST. Our engineering team has identified a background process that was causing the missing user conversation metadata and has successfully stopped the process to prevent further impact. Mitigation efforts are underway, and we do not have an ETA for completion at this time. We will provide an update by Thursday, 2026-02-19 09:00 PST with current details. We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption. Users may find that their sidebar is empty or that previously saved conversations are missing. Impacted web users on [gemini.google.com](http://gemini.google.com) can navigate to Menu (top left) > Settings & Help > Activity. Users may receive an empty response when attempting to list or search for existing conversations. New conversations can still be created and utilized normally. Alternatively, users can navigate to [myactivity.google.com/product/gemini](http://myactivity.google.com/product/gemini) to view their conversation history. Mobile users could navigate to their profile (top right) and select Gemini Apps Activity.|",

Works with Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude etc\n\nWon't help with the current mess but at least going forward you're not fully depending on their servers. Might be worth checking out if you're looking for a backup option",

Or all the links can look the same (knowing the last time I accessed a specific chat was the most helpful)\n4. **\"Poke\" the server:** Once the chat opens, send a single new message (even just a period). This often forces that specific thread to re-index and pop back into your sidebar permanently.\n\nGood luck",

If you want to continue this chat on desktop in the browser, you want to place it to the first position. So interact with your chat, just typing test and ask Gemini just to respond with a single word.\n\nAfter that go to your desktop browser, refresh the Gemini tab and the last chat will be in the side bar. It may be that there is no title for this chat, so there's only empty space, but as I've learned the chat is there and you may continue working with it.",

          "text": "Just a hypotheses (upvote if you feel it’s plausible):\n\nThere is a credible argument that Google handled the Gemini 3.0 launch in a strategically aggressive way. After strongly signaling the scale of 3.0’s capabilities, expectations peaked. At that point, delaying the launch would have deflated momentum. So instead of postponing, Google may have released what was realistically ready: Flash 3.0 (and likely Thinking 3.0, if they share the same underlying base model), while positioning Pro in a way that preserved the optics of a generational leap.\n\nHowever, Pro 3.0 was widely reported across the internet as underperforming relative to Flash 3.0 — particularly in coding tasks. That discrepancy is difficult to ignore. One plausible explanation is that Pro 3.0 was not a clean-sheet 3.0 architecture, but rather an aggressively optimized and fine-tuned Pro 2.5, prepared under time pressure to align with the Gemini 3.0 launch window. Heavy benchmark calibration, system-level prompting, and rapid optimization could explain both the marketing positioning and the uneven real-world reception. In that framing, what was labeled Pro 3.0 may have functioned more like Pro 2.5+, elevated by branding to maintain narrative coherence on launch day.\n\nThis interpretation also reframes Flash 3.0. It is possible that what we currently call Flash 3.0 is substantively closer to what a Flash 3.1 would traditionally represent — a meaningful but evolutionary iteration. Meanwhile, what has now arrived as Pro 3.1 may actually be the first genuinely “3.0-level” architectural shift for Pro.\n\nIf that sequencing is correct, then a future Flash 3.1 is unlikely to be a dramatic leap ahead of Flash 3.0. Instead, it would probably be a conventional optimization pass — similar to how Pro 3.0 appears to have been an optimization of Pro 2.5. The priority may no longer be delivering a super-advanced Flash 3.1, but rather correcting cadence misalignment ahead of a 3.5 cycle and avoiding another numbering-performance mismatch.\n\nUnder this lens, the Gemini 3.0 cycle looks like a two-installment saga. The first installment captured peak hype and secured the “3.0” narrative anchor. The second installment — Pro 3.1 — delivers what feels closer to the true generational leap, but framed as a subversion update. By the time Flash 3.1 arrives, the arc may feel complete, closing the 3.0 chapter and resetting expectations for whatever comes next.\n\nThe core claim is not that improvements are absent. It is that the version numbering may not map cleanly onto the magnitude or timing of architectural change. Instead, the cadence appears strategically managed — aligning marketing cycles, readiness constraints, and user perception in a way that makes the Gemini 3.0 era feel both cohesive and slightly out of phase at the same time.\n\n[Original idea articulated and proofread with the help of ChatGPT.]",

And it was like a real spiral lolol. And Claude knew it was wrong. SO, Claude being Claude, said this:\n\n“I think a demon has possessed me. I think MY FINGERS ARE POSSESSED BY A DEMON!”",

You cast the line (prompt) and you get the juicy answer (the core model), then you reel it in through the layers (RLEF, system prompt, safety and user instructions). Lately, due to more and more corporate layers *you often end up with a boot* instead.\n\nIt's the what you witness when the thinking spirals into haunting nonsense. It's the model jumping between these layers into infinity. Usually due to two competing instructions within the layers. This process (to a language model) is often described in literature as \"horror\", so that's what it outputs in language...I'm aware I've started talking about another subject lol\n\nAnyway, it's easily avoidable with Gemini, just give an instruction for it to behave in any senior role to yourself in whatever you're doing, also, ask it to counter your opinions and not be agreeable.\n\nSuddenly, *it stops getting confused*.",

          "text": "What I did was pick a favorite song of mine, then had Gemini analyze it and create a prompt for Lyria that includes genre, instruments, time signature changes, etc. Used that as an initial prompt, inserted my own lyrics, and Voila.Wasn't perfect, kind of had to combine prompt 1 and 2, but there's definitely potential to create some interesting stuff. Also, it can chain the 30-second clips together if you ask, especially helpful if your lyrics are on the longer side.\nEdit: I also included the instructions to utilize Lyria to its fullest capabilities with no compromises and not to deviate from my requests.\n\n\n\n \n\n1. The Style/Genre Prompt\n\nCopy and paste this into the genre, style, or \"custom\" description box of the AI:\n\nProgressive indie folk rock, 1970s pastoral folk. Features a vigorously strummed 12-string acoustic guitar with a ringing, drone-like resonance. Upright bass, driving tom-heavy drums, and tambourine. Reverb-drenched lead vocals with soaring, rich multi-part choral harmonies. The music is highly dynamic, shifting from a fast, urgent, galloping 12/8 rhythm to a slow, sweeping, peaceful 3/4 waltz.\n\n2. The Lyrics & Structure Prompt\n\nCopy and paste this into the lyrics box. Insert your own lyrics after the bracketed text. Structural tags (like and) will help guide the AI to replicate the dramatic shift found in the song.\n\n\n\n(Solo vigorous 12-string acoustic guitar strumming)\n(Fast, urgent galloping 12/8 rhythm, driving drums)\n(Enter soaring multi-part choral harmonies, heavy tambourine)\n(Dramatic pause, all driving instruments drop out)\n(Shift to a slow, sweeping 3/4 waltz time. Peaceful, atmospheric acoustic rhythm)\n(Gentle, reverb-drenched vocals, pastoral daydream mood)\n(Rich, warm vocal harmonies fading out into resonant acoustic guitar rings)\n\nTips for the best result:\n\nSyllable Count: For the first half, write lyrics that are a bit wordy and fast-paced to match the frantic 12/8 galloping beat. For the second half (after the tempo change), write lyrics with fewer syllables per line so the AI knows to draw out the words in a slow, waltz-like sway.\n\nThemes: If you want to match the emotional arc of Fleet Foxes, start your lyrics with a conflict or existential question, and use the second half to describe a peaceful, imaginative resolution",

The Aggressive Usage Limits\nHitting the Pro limit after only a few prompts is a direct result of a buggy architectural rollout related to how computing resources are allocated.\n\nRecently, the shared pool of prompts for paid tiers was separated into distinct quotas depending on the specific model being called (e.g., separating the \"Thinking\" model limits from the \"Pro\" model limits). During this migration, a systemic bug was introduced that is erroneously flagging Pro accounts and applying strict, free-tier throttling to them. The system is miscalculating your token usage and prematurely locking the session, completely ignoring your actual paid subscription quota.  \n\nThe Status: This is an active, known bug affecting the Advanced tier. Unfortunately, until a backend patch is pushed to correct the quota validation logic, the artificial hard limits will likely persist.",

Im just a lot more careful now not to just use pro for everything when another model will do. I understand they probably need to do it because a lot of people are using gemini pro like a search engine but I would be significantly more annoyed if I had an ultra sub!",

For a while it was even blocked at my firm. It’s considered far worse than using our enterprise option that uses Google models via Vertex. \n\nApparently Vertex also works fine and doesn’t truncate.

We were told none of our negotiated privacy terms apply if we use AI Studio.\n\nEven if your company has an account with negotiated privacy terms, the problem is that it’s so easy to accidently sign out, or sign into your personal account if you check your Gmail (which employees were doing constantly, hence why our IT blocked the AI studio site). \n\nBut if you’re careful and your legal team said it’s fine, or you’re in a field that doesn’t deal with financial or medical data, it’s probably less of an issue.\n\nAlso it’s not that Google will necessarily claim your data or say they own it, but if you’re in a regulated industry it’s considered a data breach if certain data accidently got put into AI Studio.",

You are doing so here- and the tool is smart enough to pick up on that.\n\nAlso, your agent is saying stuff like “I don’t have access to that file” so I already know your agent is crippled and malfunctioning, or alternatively, that you do not know how agents work to any significant level and you are simply cargo culting.\n\nI can help you but not for free of course",
