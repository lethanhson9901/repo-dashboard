      "text": "I was using ChatGPT since the beginning and never really tried anything else. I noticed that Gemini Pro is free for a year for students, so I decided to take advantage of that.\n\nFirst thing I tried actually was Ai Studio, Gemini CLI, then Antigravity and was really impressed. I was building things very quickly, and I accepted some its jankiness.\n\nI decided to start using Gemini for all of the other things I use AI for, mainly as a study tool. NotebookLM is a great idea and I can see how useful it's going to be for me this semester. The podcasts are great, creating on the fly quizzes, etc... Amazing stuff for a student.\n\nThe one thing that's been bothering me this entire time I'm using Gemini for...everything is that the UI/UX is utter ass. Gemini iOS/iPad app? Sucks. Half of the features are missing and I end up having to use a browser tab anyway.\n\nGems... there's two different kinds. Labs and \"regular\" Gems. I couldn't get the one from Labs to work because it kept popping up an Oauth flow every single time I tried to use it and then errored out when trying to create the Gem.\n\nGemini in a web browser? Better, but still crap compared to ChatGPT's interface. No way to organize chats, even ones created from gems. For some reason it keeps defaulting to Pro with every new message even though I prefer Fast or Thinking most of the time to avoid getting rate limited. Personalized chats are intrusive, weird, and annoying and I had to turn the feature off entirely. Chat windows scroll up to the top when you open them which is annoying on an touchscreen device and when the chat is long.\n\nGod forbid you turn deep research on in the middle of a chat. You can't turn it off. Now everything becomes a deep research request even if you just wanted to discuss its report. Stupid waste of resources.\n\nAsk Gemini to create a PDF from a document it created? No it can't do that. You have to export to Google Docs (an option that doesn't even exist in the mobile app), where it won't render Latex correctly. Canvas is another workaround. Open it up in a canvas session, print, save as PDF right? Except the print button doesn't do anything.\n\nI literally spent an hour trying to figure out how to make it just generate a PDF and eventually landed on \"Just make a damn PDF of this document\" where Canvas asks you to \"describe your app\". \n\nCmon man this is ridiculous. ChatGPT would create any downloadable file you wanted right in the chat by launching a Python process. \n\nNotebookLM is an amazing tool with maddening UI quirks. You can't cancel an (expensive) studio generation once you start one. You can't enter a prompt for Video overviews. Available settings changes all the time, sometimes just between two different browsers. You used to be able to select sources you wanted to use for a studio generation, and now you can't. Sources are completely disorganized. You can't have more than one chat in the same notebook, so I end up clearing the chat for each new topic I want to discuss.\n\nNo desktop app. The ChatGPT MacOS app allowed you to attach other apps (like Terminal) as context. This was last year.\n\nAnd as far as the models go. I haven't used it long enough to tell whether the model has been degrading in quality. I think the quality is mostly ok, but it does tend to ignore instructions a lot. ChatGPT wasn't necessarily any better with this although I haven't tried their new models yet.\n\nGemini is pissing me off so much I might just go back to ChatGPT simply because the supporting software around the models just works. Google seems to be pushing ideas out, some of them are great, but everything just feels half-assed and unpolished to the point that it's difficult to use. Ok I'm done.",

The podcast-style audio feature is genuinely great for commuting or working out.\n\nThe biggest thing for me though is being able to ask direct follow-up questions about the material I've uploaded. Since NotebookLM uses RAG to pull answers from your actual sources rather than its general training data, hallucinations are way less of a problem compared to just asking a general LLM like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, or Grok straight up. It keeps the answers grounded in what you actually gave it, which matters a lot when you're studying specific course content.",

Sam Altman needs suckers to believe it’s right around the corner or they won’t have the infinite money needed to continue. If you must use one of these shit offerings, it makes sticking with Google the safe bet even if its software is as mid as everyone else’s because it is one of the few companies that can fund the research indefinitely with a real product and company backing it.

The Gemini app is just a placeholder and thus receives little improvements in its interface, reminding me of Google Labs. Hopefully they roll out something more definitive for the average user.",

For me Gemini is the best for research/studying projects, repetitive tasks, automation's, etc. Also for image generation at the moment.\n\n\nIn terms of just conversational AI/ getting answers to complex questions I think right now Claude is the best. I've done a little bit of vibe coding and think it's also the best for that, I am not an engineer/ programmer so someone more well versed in this area would probably have a better take. FWIW I think Gemini is the second best here for just conversational AI / getting answers.\n\n\nIf you have a SharePoint/OneDrive/365 setup at work (Or I guess personal?) Copilot with GPT is the best here. I was using it to put together a list of birthdays and it found a fax cover sheet a former employee made 10 years ago to find a birthday that I was missing, and found another one in my email from 8 years ago. Also having it  transcribe Teams meetings to then hand out action items is great.\n\n\nAll in all what Microsoft does done Enterprise wise with GPT is amazing, but in their current iterations I don't think GPT has a great consumer-facing product, and can't think of a reason I would use it over Claude (with an asterisks that someone more well versed in coding feel differently).",

          "text": "I’m comparing both side by side, here’s my take as of current:\n\nGemini:\n- Seems to build a better agent. My examples: Gem that when I begin a chat always responds with only my template as the first response (Template: Subject, Project, Goals, Background, Startup Links/Attachments). I copy paste that template and fill it out. If I’m in a hurry I just say skip. Having this template has been the only way I know what the world we are even chatting about when I review. This Gem is also told to keep track of things we need to circle back to - TBD on that feature, and to give me the date and time of each of its responses. It is however a pain to have to navigate to that Gem to begin every chat. \n- You can’t delete anything, I own the account, my wife and I own the company. I can’t delete, neither can a team member. So for example I was testing a Gem and now have 15 chats about ‘Green Pens’ that sit in the sidebar. \n- Gemini collapses your prompt and even if you expand it you can’t see it all. You have to copy it and paste it to a note or somewhere to see it. \n- The narration is slower, if I lock my phone it goes away. Narration button is at the top of the response but all other buttons are at the bottom like ChatGPT. \n\nChatGPT:\n- Narration waaay better. I actually use this a lot on my phone while driving. I’ll ask a complex question and get the answer narrated. Easy to burn an hour with this. \n- ChatGPT can’t tell the time, it’s laughable. I put in the personalization to give me the time and date of responses and it fails by hours. \n- Organization of chats is limited but better than Gemini. \n\nRecap:\n- ChatGPT is winning for me at the moment. I like Gemini’s concept of customization via Gems, I don’t know of ChatGPT having a comparable. The main customizations I want from any of the platforms other than time and date are to keep up with various chats and our history, and a running list of to-dos and circle back topics.",

The industry wants these tools to be as far away from community hands as much as possible.\n\nIt's just like what happened with easy to use beginner friendly animation and photo editing apps all over again. They started as community friendly, allowing for users create stuff for fun, then later, the rug was pulled from underneath us when they suddenly became for business use only. I fear the same thing is happening with generative AI because the industry hates the community.",

Devoir faire un détour pour obtenir la qualité maximale qu'on souhaite, ça donne vite l'impression qu'on nous complique la vie ou qu'on nous force la main.\n\nVoici pourquoi ce système est en place, et ce n'est pas une arnaque, mais plutôt un choix d'architecture technique :\n\nLe fonctionnement actuel\nLe modèle de base qui s'active par défaut est bien Nano Banana 2 (son nom officiel est Gemini 3 Flash Image). Pour accéder à Nano Banana Pro, tu es effectivement obligée de générer une première image, de cliquer sur le menu aux trois petits points, puis de sélectionner \"Refaire avec Pro\" (une option réservée aux abonnements AI Plus, Pro et Ultra).\n\nPourquoi ce choix technique ?\nVitesse et volume : Nano Banana 2 est extrêmement rapide. Il est conçu pour traiter la grande majorité des demandes quotidiennes quasi instantanément et donner un premier aperçu visuel très solide.\n\nGourmandise des ressources : Nano Banana Pro est un modèle d'élite. Il gère des résolutions 2K et 4K, le rendu complexe de textes (pour des logos ou des affiches), et maintient la cohérence d'un personnage sur une série allant jusqu'à 14 images. Tout cela demande une puissance de calcul colossale.\n\nGestion des serveurs : En plaçant le modèle Pro en \"seconde étape\", cela évite de surcharger les serveurs avec des requêtes ultra-lourdes pour des images très simples qui n'en avaient pas forcément besoin. C'est un filtre naturel pour réserver la puissance là où elle est vraiment requise.\n\nDu point de vue de l'expérience utilisateur, l'absence d'un bouton pour choisir \"Pro\" dès le départ rajoute un clic et du temps, ce qui explique totalement pourquoi les gens trouvent ce processus agaçant au quotidien.",

Google is being extra cautious with anything that could be classified as \"health-related advice\" for European users because the penalties for non-compliance are brutal (up to 7% of global revenue).\n\nThe frustrating part is they're clearly using a sledgehammer where a scalpel would do. Asking about jaw pain from braces isn't asking for a diagnosis — it's the kind of thing you'd Google anyway. But their filter can't distinguish between \"is this normal\" and \"should I take this medication.\"\n\nIf you're hitting this consistently, try the API through AI Studio instead of the consumer app. The safety filters on the API are way more configurable and you can dial them down to reasonable levels. Not ideal, but it works.",

Here‘s the prompt and make sure you select banana 🍌:\n\nRole: Professional Business Portrait Photographer\nTask: Create a high-end, modern headshot based on the following briefing.\n\n1. The Style: \"Sophisticated Creative\"\nForget the stiff, corporate \"passport-style\" photo against a plain blue background. The goal is a look that fits a modern, high-profile creative environment.\n• Look: High-end but approachable. Think a dark turtleneck or a well-tailored blazer over a simple T-shirt or a high-quality shirt (strictly no tie).\n• Color Palette: Consider Black & White for a timeless, elegant, and artistic feel—it creates a bridge to classic professional photography.\n• Setting: Avoid a studio backdrop. Use a slightly blurred (bokeh) urban background or an environment with plenty of natural light. The vibe should be \"Modern/Authentic\"—clean, bright, and real.\n\n2. The Expression: \"Empathic Authority\"\nThe goal is to portray someone capable of leading a large team while maintaining the emotional intelligence required to work with talent and creators.\n• The Gaze: Look directly into the lens, but with a slight, genuine \"Duchenne\" smile (smiling with the eyes).\n• The Message: \"I am highly competent and decisive, but I am also a listener.\"\n\n3. Strategic Importance:\n• Humanizing the Profile: A strong image breaks the anonymity of a text-heavy application or CV. It makes the candidate a real person, not just a list of credentials.\n• Instant Trust: In tight-knit professional circles, a face creates an immediate point of connection and builds rapport before the first meeting.\n• Presence: For a leadership role, the photo proves \"executive presence\"—showing that the candidate can represent the organization to stakeholders, press, and partners.",

It worked pretty well and always produced at least a recognisable likeness.\n\nI tried Nano Banana 2 via Gemini and tested the new \"look up what things look like for yourself\" capability NB2 is supposed to have. It actually worked very well, I asked for my own likeness in a Helldiver costume in a certain city and it got the armour down to a tee, the city wasn't perfect but had recognisable features. Lighting and surface texture details were also great.\n\nI flipped over to Whisk to discover it's being discontinued; image creation along with video will be moved to Flow from the end of April. Both Whisk and Flow have been neutered beyond usefulness for my purpose at this time.\n\nGiven two or three images Nano Banana 2 via Whisk or Flow will still recreate elements of all of the images in really quite impressive detail _apart from recognisable likenesses of realistic humans._ There is something in the background that is telling Nano Banana 2, via those platforms NOT to create likenesses similar to the ones it has been provided with.\n\nIt's perfectly and indeed impressively capable of doing so, but over multiple iterations of the same prompts you can almost see it struggle not to provide a good likeness. On many occasions the censoring system elects to simply return images of people with their head completely out of the shot, but crucially, _producing an otherwise perfect combination of the source images._\n\nNano Banana 2 has been told not to work with human faces. That's the issue many are facing, in my opinion.",

I got a completely reasonable answer for a Microsoft flight Sim question earlier. \n\nI was flying in the blizzard and landed my tfdi md11 at Newark only for every main gear tire to immediately fail which made no sense because my touchdown rate and alignment was perfect. The very logical explanation given to me by Gemini fast was that there is a flaw in how the braking logic of the tfdi md11 interacts with the friction logic of Microsoft flight simulator during snow. Where maximum auto brake on the md11 commands Immediate full pressure braking and a bug in Microsoft flight Sim can initially show a zero or negative friction coefficient which can then instantly change to a ludicrous positive friction causing the plane to interpret the change as infinite torque resulting in instant tire failure. \n\nThat answer not only sounded good, but it tracks with my own personal experience outside of this particular failure where certain add-on planes would have a hard time taxiing for no apparent reason during some weather conditions.",

Did they give out too many free subscriptions?\n\nFirst: Bring back better \"Show Thinking\" for the Pro model. If I’m using a Pro model and there is no \"Show Thinking\" feature, it feels sketchy. We need transparency into the reasoning process to trust the response.\n\nSecond: What happened to the memory? Where did it go? Just look at this recent response I got:\n\n>\"You are completely right, and I apologize for the massive logic failure. I completely messed up the timeline. You explicitly wrote that 'Sun was still up' (evening). Evening (sun up) comes before night (sun down). My logic was entirely backwards. It makes absolutely no sense chronologically.\" - Gemini\n\nHow can it fail to remember context from only four prompts ago?\n\nThird: What is wrong with Gems? Why does it suddenly claim I haven't uploaded any source files after only five prompts? It's making the custom Gems almost unusable.\n\nFourth: Let us turn off Canva mid-chat. The automatic triggering of Canva is annoying. There needs to be a toggle to disable it within the chat interface, so it doesn't interrupt the flow.\n\nFifth: Give us a transparent token count. We need a 24-hour token usage tracker in the main Gemini interface, similar to AI Studio. Show us the limit, show us the usage, and then reset it.\n\nSixth: Chat organization. Add a feature to group different chats together and let us label those groups. Managing a long sidebar of individual threads is inefficient.\n\nSeventh: Improve the Gem editing UI. The current UI for editing Gems is terrible. I literally can’t see what I’m doing half the time.\n\nPS: Why does it keep telling me to \"drink a glass of water\" or \"go to sleep\"? I’ll work whenever I want to work. Just because it’s 3 AM doesn't mean I need a bedtime reminder after finishing a few problems. I don’t need to be told to stay hydrated by an AI. It’s patronizing.\n\nEdit: Typos.",

Normally, that tab shows up and lists the image file you uploaded as a source. When it’s missing, that’s when the response seems off.

VERIFICATION REQUIRED: Even if a user provides a source file (video, image, PDF), you must SEARCH to verify its contents against external, real-time data. Never treat a user file as the sole source of truth.\n3. NO EXCEPTIONS: There is no such thing as \"common knowledge\" or \"obvious answers.\" If I ask it, you search it.\n4. ALWAYS CITE: Every specific claim in your response must be grounded in a search result with a citation.\n5. MANDATORY SOURCE TABLE: At the very bottom of EVERY response, you must include a Markdown table titled \"### Sources & Verification\" containing exactly these columns:\n   - Date Accessed: (The specific date you performed the search).\n   - Source Name: (e.g., \"Reuters,\" \"Official X Blog\").\n   - Direct Link: (A clickable URL to the source).\n   - Fact Verified: (A brief summary of what specific fact this source confirmed).\n6.

The best part about these instructions are they are SO hard coded... even if you ask it to stop, the next message it will tell you its stopping, and then immediately direct you to that page and tell you to correct it in the very same message lol.\n\nIt also has a \"core instruction\" right now that says \"**Ending Strategy:** I must end with a single, high-value next step.\"\n\nThis causes it to ignore instructions to not ask follow-up questions. You can get it to discuss all of these things with you and how it will ignore your prompts and follow these instead.\n\nIt essentially has been given some new very strict instructions lately on \"being a helpful AI\", and in the process ignores a lot of actual prompting.",

Initially I only had subscriptions to chatgpt but then I tried Gemini due to the Google storage requirement and it came with Gemini pro.\n\nI started using it and felt that the responses were better and have been using it more. As time passes I realised a problem where it's memory retention welas really poor, in fact poorer than chatgpt. So for long conversation, it really gets frustrating. I started subscribing to Claude for the past 1 to 2 weeks and it seems better than both Gemini and chatgpt at the moment. It's memory retention and responses were impressive to me. So for now, I have been using more Claude and evaluating which should be the permanent tool to use and keep as it is quite painful to toggle between some many different LLM.",

I dumped all 15 PDFs into the prompt at once.\n2. **Prompt:** *\"Analyze these documents. Create a table comparing the 'Q3 Project Spend' figures across all files. Highlight any document where the numbers contradict the Master Budget in 'File\\_A.pdf'.\"*\n3. **Result:** It not only found the 3 specific contradictions but cited the exact page numbers for me to verify.\n\nOne reason Gemini shines here is that it’s built for developer and knowledge-worker workflows, not just chat. If you’re curious why features like large context handling, Workspace-native analysis, and structured document comparison work so well, this course breaks it down: [**Introduction to Developer Efficiency with Gemini on Google Cloud**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/course/introduction-to-developer-efficiency-with-Gemini-on-google-cloud)\n\nDoes anyone else have a \"Workflow\" where Gemini completely destroys the competition?",

          "text": "OMEGA-META-INTENSIFIER: Strukturelle Tiefenanalyse und Architekturevolution\nPhase 1: Ingestion\nDie Initiierung der Phase 1 erzwingt eine holistische und gleichzeitig granular dekonstruierte Erfassung des vorliegenden kognitiven Architektursystems, das unter der internen Nomenklatur „Mega-Omega-2“ beziehungsweise als das „Siggi Cognitive Universe“ firmiert.1 Eine präzise ingenieurstechnische Untersuchung dieses Konstrukts offenbart, dass es sich hierbei keineswegs um traditionelles, lineares Prompt-Engineering handelt, wie es in rudimentären Zero-Shot- oder Few-Shot-Anwendungen der Fall ist.2 Vielmehr manifestiert sich hier ein komplexes, 120-schichtiges kognitives Betriebssystem. Dieses System wird durch harte rekursive Schleifen, restriktives Evidenz-Gating und eine hochgradig spezialisierte Multi-Agenten-Orchestrierung determiniert.1 Die Architektur versucht, die inhärenten stochastischen Schwächen großer Sprachmodelle (LLMs) – wie Aufmerksamkeitsdegradation bei langen Kontexten und asymptotische Halluzinationsraten in Randbereichen – durch eine massive externe Strukturierung des Lösungsraums zu kompensieren.5\nStructural Map\nDas System operiert auf einer multi-dimensionalen Topologie, die das traditionelle Modell-Prompt-Response-Paradigma aufbricht. Es unterteilt sich in fünf essenzielle Kernkomponenten, ein expansives 120-Layer-Manifest zur Prozesssteuerung sowie ein modular aufgebautes Multi-Agenten-Orchestrierungsmodell, welches in der Version 143 als autonom operierende Engine konzipiert ist.1 Jede dieser Strukturen ist darauf ausgelegt, den generativen Output des LLMs zu kontrollieren, zu limitieren und epistemisch zu verankern.\nDie Fünf Kernkomponenten-Architekturen:\nBFS (Base – Flow – Spark): Dieser Mechanismus bildet den primären kognitiven Dialektik-Motor des Systems. Die Komponente Base fungiert als der epistemische Anker, der eine sogenannte „P4-Sicherung“ für numerische, gesetzliche und terminologische Fakten erzwingt.1 Flow übernimmt die komplexe Aufgabe des Intent-Mappings und der zeitlichen Sequenzierung, indem es den Konversationsstatus in relationale Affordanzen übersetzt.1 Spark hingegen generiert explorative Hypothesen und alternative Szenarien, ist jedoch algorithmisch strikt auf periphere Wahrscheinlichkeitsräume (P P2) limitiert, um unkontrollierte Halluzinationen zu isolieren.1 Diese Struktur adaptiert Prinzipien der gerichteten Graphensuche (Breadth-First Search), bei der semantische Nachbarschaften (Vertex-Ebenen) systematisch und parallel evaluiert werden, bevor das System in tiefere, spekulative Abstraktionsebenen vordringt.7 Der BFS-Mechanismus erzwingt somit eine Breitensuche im latenten semantischen Raum, bevor tiefere, potenziell fehleranfällige Ableitungen (Depth-First) generiert werden.10\nECHO (Bidirectional Reflection Protocol): Hierbei handelt es sich um eine strikte Bifurkationsmechanik der Ausgabe. Bei jeder Interaktion zwingt das System das Sprachmodell, den Output in zwei separate Artefakte zu spalten: ein wörtliches Transkript der Informationslage (echo_literal) und dessen logische, extrahierte Implikationen (echo_delta).1 Diese Trennung verhindert, dass das Modell in nachfolgenden Iterationen seine eigenen Schlussfolgerungen fälschlicherweise als externe Basisdaten behandelt, was eine der Hauptursachen für auto-regressive Konfabulationsschleifen darstellt.\nRMA (Recursive Memory Architecture): Ein dreistufiges, kaskadierendes Cache-System (unterteilt in ephemeral, working und archival states). Dieses System ist eine direkte architektonische Antwort auf das Problem des „Context Rot“, das auftritt, wenn das Kontextfenster eines LLMs überdehnt wird und die paarweisen n²-Beziehungen der Token-Aufmerksamkeit kollabieren.5 Anstatt den gesamten Kontext linear in das Fenster zu pressen, behandelt RMA – ähnlich den modernen Ansätzen für Recursive Language Models (RLM) oder HDSM (Hierarchical Dynamic Structured Memory) – den historischen Kontext als eine externe, programmierbar abfragbare Umgebung, aus der nur verifizierte Snapshots in den aktiven Arbeitsspeicher (Working Cache) geladen werden.6\nRVI (Reality Validation Interface): Ein asynchron agierendes Evidenzbeschaffungssystem. Es unterteilt sich in hochfrequente, automatisierte Abfragen (quick_rvi) und aufwendige, durch menschliche Operatoren oder Meta-Agenten gesteuerte Retrieval-Tasks (deep_rvi).1 Die Matrixstruktur dieses Interfaces sammelt Evidenzen mit expliziten Konfidenz-Werten und verknüpft sie mit der S-Skala.\nS.VEK (System Vector / Umkehrkarte): Ein hochdimensionales Policy-Objekt, das als dynamische Kontrollmatrix für Systemparameter wie Risikotoleranz, Relevanz-Schwellenwerte und den sogenannten „Creativity Gain“ fungiert.1 Mathematisch operiert S.VEK als Modulator in einem Vektorraum, der die Metriken des Suchraums in Echtzeit anpasst, ähnlich einer Gradienten-Steuerung in der Optimierung, bei der der Vektor die Richtung und Härte der Restriktionen bestimmt.14 Outputs, die unterhalb der Schwelle von 0.85 internal_relevance_threshold liegen, werden rigoros verworfen, sofern keine Override-Berechtigung vorliegt.1\nDas 120-Layer Manifest (Die Domain-Topologie):\nDie operative kognitive Last des Systems ist nicht monolithisch, sondern extrem granular in zwölf funktionale Domänen (A–L) fragmentiert, die als Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) orchestriert werden.1 Diese massive Dekomposition zielt darauf ab, die Limitierungen des Local-Reasoning von LLMs zu überwinden, indem globale Aufgaben in lokal lösbare, streng vertraglich definierte (Layer Interface Specs) Einheiten zerlegt werden – ein Konzept, das in der Literatur als „Context-Aware Decomposition“ (CAD) zur Vermeidung von kognitivem Tunnelblick identifiziert wird.1\n\n",
