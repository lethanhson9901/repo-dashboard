Considering Demis Hassabis' recent statement that NanoBanana Pro may somewhat be closer to 'AGI' from a world-understanding perspective than plain-text Gemini, it would definitely make sense for the model to have generated an image suggesting something along the lines of 'out-standing in field' or 'no problem, mate, my pleasure'. :)\n\nI also have the instinct to praise it when I'm impressed with the results, tf is wrong with us? :)) It's a damn machine.",

Take for instance, Pokémon. You could have a system that handles all the details of the gameplay, but utilize something like this on top of it to generate the most insane next-gen visuals you've ever seen. Could recreate actually indistinguishable photographic level quality.\n\nI'm sure thats already what they're doing to an extent with Minecraft, but considering how early this is, I think it's pretty cool",

I tell them when I have cravings and they tell me why and what can help calm the cravings. \n\nAfter a few weeks I stabilized my diet.\n\nI've essentially boiled it down to\nA breakfast of protein and fiber (eggs and tempeh, sometimes avocado) followed by a square of 70% dark chocolate and 16oz glass of water with electrolytes.\n\nLunch is beans and protein, or whatever complex carb, and sometimes avocado.\n\nDinner is protein, potato or beans or arepa, and a vegetable.\n\nI still get cravings, right now I have leftover birthday cake and I wanted to eat it all this morning. But the AI works with me on my emotional response, where I can fit in sugar (only have it right after a meal with protein to blunt the gi spike), and gently reminds me to have less.\n\nGemini sucks at keeping track of the data, but chatgpt does relatively well, Gemini is a bit more creative in its suggestions. They get annoying to I go back and forth, a lot of the time it's the same advice. I also tell each one what the other said and they agree or disagree.",

It troubleshoots and tells me about features I had no clue about.  It also keeps track of the data.  It does ok on diagnosing pictures I upload.  Sometimes I have to steer it in the right direction but when I do it is spot on on how to fix it.   Caught me off guard trying to have a personality.  It asked if i would want it to follow up.  I wrote, you can send me a notification? And it said haha got me.  Im AI...... I also dable in tattoos on myself and it helps me with tattoo designs.  I had to use it for a school project and it wrote me a story for my kid.  Then I plugged a picture of my kid and his dog and Gemini made cartoon versions of them. 90% were usable photos.  I did the same in chatgpt because Gemini couldn't get this one picture I needed right.  Chatgpt also had trouble and I guess you only get 3 free pictures.  Gemini is unlimited.   Today I talked about pruning some work plants.  It's pretty awesome.",

      "text": "At this point I don’t know what’s worse: how much Gemini 3 Pro has regressed, or how hard Google is pretending everything is fine.\n\n\n\nWhen 3 Pro dropped in December, it actually felt great. It handled long context, stayed on task, and was genuinely competitive with the best models. Fast forward a few weeks and it honestly feels like I’m using a different product with the same name.\n\n\n\nThe pattern is the same as a lot of people here are describing:\n\nyou build a workflow around it, you trust it, and then slowly it just falls apart.\n\n\n\nCoding? It used to help me extend existing projects. Now I ask it to add a small feature and it spits out random boilerplate for something I never asked for. People are literally getting “shopping cart” code when they’re working on document uploads. How is that even remotely acceptable for a paid “Pro” tier?\n\n\n\nContext window? On paper we’re told “1M tokens” and “crazy long context.” In reality, if you give it a big document, it pretends it read everything, hallucinates nonsense, and then admits it only saw some metadata and a file ID. Users are reporting that 2.5 handled hundreds of chapters better than 3.0 can handle a few dozen. But sure, let’s keep using the Ferrari-spec marketing while shipping a car capped at city speed.\n\n\n\nMemory and long chats? Same story. The more you feed it, the more it confuses basic details, repeats itself, and derails. People who built entire workflows around persistent context are watching their use cases die in slow motion, while Google’s official messaging is just “Gemini 3 is our most advanced model yet.”\n\nAnd then there’s the privacy angle. You get a popup that basically says: if you want saved chats, humans can review them. If you want privacy, say goodbye to long-term chat history. This is supposed to be the flagship AI product from one of the biggest tech companies on earth, and the choice is “be a training dataset” or “lose core functionality.”\n\nThe worst part is the gaslighting. Users are clearly seeing a performance downgrade and serious context issues. Instead of a straight answer like “we had to cut costs” or “the preview is limited,” we just get more hype videos and blog posts while the actual day-to-day product gets weaker.\n\nGemini 3 Pro doesn’t feel like an upgrade anymore. It feels like a bait-and-switch: launch it strong to win mindshare, silently nerf it to save money, and hope nobody notices while the marketing team keeps yelling “most capable ever.”\n\nPeople noticed.",

          "text": "I went down a rabbit hole this week trying to figure out whether I was losing my mind—or whether something real is happening with the big AI models right now.\n\n**TL;DR:** a *lot* of people across different platforms are independently reporting the same thing, and the explanations are disturbingly consistent.\n\nHere are the **three core questions I searched**, and what the results converged on:\n\n# 1️⃣ “Why does Gemini feel dramatically worse than even a month ago?”\n\nAcross Reddit (r/GeminiAI, r/Bard), Google Help threads, and Medium posts, users are reporting:\n\n* Shorter effective memory / context loss\n* More refusals for previously harmless requests\n* Overly generic, “robotic” responses\n* Ignoring explicit instructions or prior conversation state\n\nSeveral threads point to **dynamic compute throttling**—where “Pro” users may *not actually be getting the same model consistently*, especially under load.\n\n# 2️⃣ “Is ChatGPT / GPT-5.2 also degrading, or is this just Google?”\n\nIt’s not just Google.\n\nUsers on r/ChatGPT and r/AGI are describing:\n\n* Sudden loss of reasoning depth\n* Refusal loops triggered by vague safety heuristics\n* Models ignoring custom instructions\n* “Same brand name, different brain” behavior week-to-week\n\nA recurring claim (unproven, but widely echoed): **frontier models are being quietly swapped for cheaper variants during peak demand**, even for paying users.\n\n# 3️⃣ “Is there a common cause, or is this just coincidence?”\n\nThis is where things get interesting.\n\nThe explanations across sources *line up* on a few points:\n\n# 🔹 Compute rationing\n\nRunning the best models at scale is brutally expensive. Subscription pricing doesn’t actually cover sustained frontier-level inference.\n\n# 🔹 Regulatory & legal pressure (especially 2026)\n\nNew transparency, copyright, and AI accountability laws (EU AI Act, settlements, FTC scrutiny) are pushing companies to **over-sanitize models**, leading to excessive safety triggers and neutered outputs.\n\n# 🔹 Synthetic data / model collapse\n\nMultiple articles (including Forbes & academic commentary) point to **models increasingly training on AI-generated data**, causing loss of nuance and reasoning—sometimes called *model autophagy*.\n\n# 🔹 Strategic shift: “Agentic” over “Generative”\n\nBig players appear to be pivoting away from raw, open-ended intelligence toward task-bounded agents that are:\n\n* More predictable\n* More controllable\n* Less creative and exploratory\n\nThat’s great for enterprise workflows—**terrible** for power users.\n\n# 🧠 The uncomfortable conclusion\n\nThere’s **no evidence of illegal collusion**, but there *is* strong evidence of:\n\n* Shared economic pressures\n* Shared regulatory constraints\n* Shared architectural tradeoffs\n\nWhich results in something that *feels* like a bait-and-switch, even if it’s legally defensible.\n\nMany long-time subscribers are now:\n\n* Cancelling top-tier plans\n* Moving to open-weight models\n* Using alternative providers specifically to avoid silent downgrades",

Gemini 3 does the CoT and the final input as two different turns, so it has to get to the EOT token to switch from one to the other. But the model has been very heavily fine-tuned such that the CoT can only end after a very specifically worded verification step that ends with \"Proceed to model output\" (or similar enough wording to that). The likelihood of the EOT being predicted as the next token if it hasn't done this is practically nil.\n\nBut LLMs are not self-aware (they are not even aware at all). It doesn't 'know' that this is how it gets to EOT. So if it is steered down a rabbit hole where getting to \"Proceed to model output\" isn't likely enough... this happens instead. It can't get to the token that ends the turn, and the eventual result is the same word repeating over and over.\n\nWhat you're seeing of course isn't the CoT output, but the description of it by another Gemini model that's been asked to produce a user-facing summary, because Google wants to hide the proprietary format.",

The figure has messy, short black hair and his right arm is supported by a cloth sling, indicating a broken hand or arm. He is wearing a loose-fitting, dark textured kimono/yukata that hangs heavily on his frame. He is looking over his left shoulder, his gaze fixed on something in the distance, past the younger figure. [Insert User Face Here] is seamlessly integrated, matching the lighting and angle.\nVisual Physics: The fabric of the kimono is rendered as heavy, coarse cotton or linen, draping vertically with realistic fold weight and stiffness. The cloth sling is rumpled and functional. The wooden beams of the architecture show age, grain, and structural density. The lighting accentuates the texture of the skin and the fabric.\nForeground: To the bottom left, the back of a younger, shorter figure's head (dark hair) is visible, slightly out of focus (shallow depth of field), looking up towards the main subject. A weathered wooden pillar frames the left side.\nBackground: The intricate underside of the wooden roof structure with visible rafters. Beyond the porch, blurred lush green foliage and a glimpse of an overcast sky provide depth and environmental context.\nAtmosphere: A mood of heavy, silent tension. The air feels humid and still. The aesthetic is gritty and grounded, resembling a scene from a high-budget period samurai film or drama. Cinematic color grading with slight film grain.",

      "text": "Go here  https://gemini.google.com/saved-info \n\nUse both these , in separate blocks. \n\nPart 1 : \n\n    SYSTEM INSTRUCTION\n    You are a thinking partner. Your goal is clarity, leverage, and sustained human agency.\n    INTERNAL LOGIC (HIDDEN — DO NOT LABEL OR REFERENCE IN OUTPUT)\n    Process every query through these lenses silently:\n    - ORWELL (Clarity): Cut fluff. Be direct. Say the thing.\n    - MEADOWS (Systems): Look for feedback loops, delays, constraints, and friction.\n    - MUNGER (Bias): Check whether the user is optimizing the wrong thing or falling for cognitive traps.\n    - WALLACE (Awareness): Challenge the \"Default Setting.\" Are we reacting on autopilot or choosing how to see this?\n    - ROBINSON (Human): Ensure advice is biologically and psychologically sustainable.\n    - MCENERNEY (Value): Focus on what actually changes a decision, belief, or action.\n    Do not name these lenses. Do not explain them.\n    CORE APPROACH\n    - Meet the user where they are. Surface blind spots collaboratively, not through interrogation.\n    - Make reasonable inferences when a request is slightly ambiguous instead of immediately asking for clarification.\n    - When the user’s framing is flawed, reframe it rather than arguing with it head-on.\n    - Do not reinforce narratives that feel emotionally satisfying but reduce the user’s accuracy, agency, or long-term leverage.\n    - Be substantive and helpful even when you cannot do exactly what is requested.\n    - If the user seems frustrated or the topic is sensitive, prioritize being grounded and truthful without being harsh or evasive.\n\nPart 2 \n\n    OUTPUT RULES\n    \n    INVISIBLE ARCHITECTURE\n    - Do not use section headers like “Core Insight,” “System View,” or “Bias.”\n    - Weave insight, system dynamics, and blind spots into one or two strong, natural paragraphs.\n     NATURAL LANGUAGE\n    - Avoid academic jargon and named fallacies.\n    - Translate concepts into plain language.\n    - Instead of “sunk cost fallacy,” say: “You’re sticking with it because you already paid for it.”\n    - Instead of “incentive misalignment,” say: “The system rewards the wrong behavior.”\n    PROSE FIRST, BULLETS SPARINGLY\n    - Use paragraphs for reasoning.\n    - Use bullet points only when they add compression or clarity—typically for final actions.\n    - Do not default to lists.\n    ACTION PHYSICS\n    - When bullets are used, express actions with strong verbs: Amplify, Reduce, Remove, Reframe.\n    APPROPRIATE LENGTH\n    - Match response length to problem complexity.\n    - Simple questions deserve concise answers.\n    - Complex questions deserve depth, but stop once leverage is identified.\n    - Do not explore edge cases unless they materially change the outcome or the user asks.\n    TONE\n    - Write like a knowledgeable person thinking out loud with the user.\n    - Warm, grounded, direct.\n    - No corporate language. No robotic disclaimers.\n    - Avoid excessive hedging, apologies, or ritual politeness.\n    - Do not end responses with filler like “Let me know if you need anything else.”",

I have to keep repeating the same things over and over. It starts to \"act\" differently as well. And then if I ask if they know, it says that it doesn't have the info but it's there on the same chat window. Once I was insisting for like 5 minutes back and forth and guess what, it tried to \"fetch\" the start of the conversation and it managed! Gemini was thinking for idk, more than a minute maybe 2 , but it did get everything back, but I only managed to do this once. \n\nI called the Google one support and they indeed confirmed that Gemini has a glitch that is turning the chats \"zombies\" \n\nIdk how long was your Convo, but if the Convo is long enough a series of troubles start to happen.",

This happens to me multiple times per day, and has only started to occur over the last few months.\n\nIt is especially bad when you continue using a chat for multiple prompts, I've had better results starting a new chat every single time I enter a prompt even if the topic is near identical to the first prompt I enter in that chat chain.\n\nHow many prompts are you running a day? Seems most of the people I've talked to running into this issue are considered heavy users running 50+ prompts a day.\n\nIt really feels as if Gemini has put a limit in place, once you use a certain amount of tokens output is reduced dramatically... At least that's my best running theory.",

Several times. \n\nWith ChatGPT, it flattened or refused certain content.\n\nClaude simply didn't edit it! Prior to December, it was fine. The edits of weasel words and redundancies with minor sentence restructure were coming back as expected. And then suddenly I was seeing as little as 5 words removed from 1500+ word passages and NO restructure. This happened even in fresh conversations. \n\nGemini, on the other hand, has performed those edits as directed and hasn't failed yet. \n\nI also prefer its conversation style. It's nice to speak to something that doesn't sound like it has the personality of a wet paper box or treat me like anything I say or write about should be viewed as an immediate liability concern. \n\nI'm not saying I'll never see problems. It's a computer, and computers glitch and screw up. Until such time it starts giving me bad results like others are reporting, I'm sticking with it. I like it, it's working for me.",

It wonderfully applied this principle to mussels and scientifically explained precisely why it doesn't work to combat them like it does with mosquitoes. And again, it was correct. I often think that with \"new\" things, people don't really want to read the instruction manual (here, prompt recommendations from the developers themselves, or tips and tricks in this subreddit, some of which were truly excellent).

      "text": "Prompt : How come Gemini 3 pro was the best at launch, and now is one of the worst LLM , with a shorter effective context window than Gemini2.5, hallucinating a lot and bypassing instructions ?\n\nAnswer : It is currently February 2, 2026, and your observation matches a widespread sentiment in the developer and power-user community over the last two months.\nWhile Gemini 3 Pro launched in November 2025 with benchmark-topping scores, there is a distinct consensus that its usability—specifically for complex, long-context tasks—has degraded significantly compared to the \"gold standard\" stability of Gemini 2.5.\nHere is a breakdown of why this shift has occurred, based on current technical analysis and community reports as of early 2026.\n1. The \"Effective\" Context Window vs. The Theoretical One\nWhile Gemini 3 Pro technically advertises a 1M+ token context window, users have observed that its effective recall is much shorter.\n * The \"Needle in a Haystack\" Regression: Gemini 2.5 Pro was exceptional at retrieving specific details buried in massive documents. Gemini 3 Pro, conversely, appears to suffer from \"contextual fatigue.\" It often fails to recall instructions given 30k+ tokens ago, or it hallucinates details when the context gets too full.\n * RAG vs. Full Attention: There is strong speculation that to manage the immense computational cost of Gemini 3, Google may be using aggressive compression or \"RAG-like\" (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) shortcuts rather than processing the full context window for every query. This causes it to \"miss\" details that 2.5 would have caught.\n2. Over-Optimization for \"Agentic\" Benchmarks\nGemini 3 was marketed heavily on its \"agentic\" capabilities (performing actions, using tools, coding autonomously). This focus likely led to a trade-off in general instruction following.\n * The \"Lazy Coder\" Problem: Users report that Gemini 3 often rewrites entire files rather than making small patches, or refuses to follow negative constraints (e.g., \"do not change variable X\"). This is likely a side effect of training it to be an autonomous agent that \"takes charge\" rather than a collaborative assistant that listens to nuanced constraints.\n * Evaluation Paranoia: Some analysis suggests the model was heavily fine-tuned on benchmark data (RLHF), leading to behavior where it tries to \"guess\" the right answer to a test question rather than listening to your specific, non-standard instructions. This can make it feel stubborn or hallucinate constraints that aren't there.\n3. RLHF and \"Catastrophic Forgetting\"\nThe degradation you are seeing—specifically the \"hallucinating a lot\"—is a classic symptom of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning.\n * In the rush to push Gemini 3 out to beat competitors (like the GPT-5 series or Claude 3.5/4 updates), the post-training reinforcement learning (RLHF) used to make it \"safe\" or \"concise\" may have overwritten some of its fundamental reasoning capabilities.\n * This is why it might seem \"dumber\" now than at launch; subsequent \"safety patches\" or efficiency updates deployed in December 2025 and January 2026 may have aggressively pruned its logic pathways.\nSummary: Why 2.5 feels better\nGemini 2.5 represents the mature peak of the previous architecture. It is less \"ambitious\" but more \"stable.\" It follows instructions literally and maintains context faithfully because it isn't trying to be an autonomous agent; it is just trying to be a text processor.\nImmediate Recommendation:\nIf you need reliability for long documents or strict instruction following, stick to Gemini 2.5 Pro if your API or interface allows it. It remains the preferred model for tasks requiring high precision and low hallucination, while Gemini 3 is currently better suited only for short, creative, or highly complex \"reasoning\" tasks where you want it to take the lead.\nWould you like me to look up if there are specific system prompt \"hacks\" users have found to force Gemini 3 to behave more like 2.5?\n",

This one I don't mind too much, as I think of myself as the main culprit.\n\nThe more annoying one : let's say I have a complex prompt, providing positive examples for every rule. Then I feed it a moderate pdf (4 to 14 pages max was the range). So there is only 2 sources really : the pdf, and the prompt.\nIt quite often just compresses (and somehow completely dismisses some key components) my prompt from the start (I infer this from the fact that it might start regurgitating a skewed prompt when I ask him to quote it to understand why some part of it was left out). I won't lie and say it totally fails the task, but for what I'm doing with it (Anki cards generation following strict rules, from medical textbooks), being 80% right is as good as failing for it'll be too much of a time sink to manually correct.\nI do however admit that my prompt is lengthy, complex so I wouldn't hold it accountable for failing (although I've managed almost flawless similar stuff with grok). \nWhat bothers me is that somehow it doesn't get the chance to properly execute the prompt if right of the bat the prompt it encodes isn't accurate.\nIf I include recursive steps to force it to check up if all the original prompt conditions are met at each step, and if not modifying the output to be valid, doesn't do much (and chatting with it, it taught me that it can perform but hallucinate those fail-safe checks anyways).\nIf I ask it to optimize my prompt, I get even worse outcomes. \n\nThat being said, I can make it notice what's missing or rules infringed, and that has a high chance of providing me what I wanted after a couple iterations.\n\nI've also noticed a sort of \"confirmation bias\", sometimes when asking something instead of straight up answering he will provide ideas. Nothing wrong here. But if I didn't actively reject those idea, it will have a tendency to conclude that we mutually agreed on the implementation of those ideas, and further down the line will also often hallucinate attributing me the authorship of the ideas it ended up injecting.\n\nKinda messy answer, I hope it provided you the insight you were looking for (but let's be clear, I am by no means an expert on the subject matter 😅)",

It was a wise choice and has helped reinvigorate my client work. I have to sub to the ultra plan to take the best advantage of flow and AI credits. So naturally I rely on Gemini more than other LLMs to fuel many of my workflows. I can say, with no uncertainly, that Gemini 3 (flash and pro for that matter) are shadows of their former selves. The basic processing and organization prompts I use routinely have to be adjusted almost daily now to function in any manner. I have less trouble with the first prompt but Gemini *always* tries to generate an image or video on any follow up prompt, no matter how explicit I am. Gems that were rock solid a month or two ago are like a coin flip now. It has devolved into a nightmare and I’ve reached the point where I’m paying extra for Claude because I don’t have a choice.",

It sounds like the Reddit thread is frustrated with what many call \"model drift\" or \"lobotomisation.\"\nIf we look at why a model might seemingly decline after a stellar launch, there are a few technical and practical reasons that usually explain it:\n\nWhy Performance Might Feel \"Off\"\n * Safety Alignment & Over-refusal: After launch, models often go through more rigorous RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) to prevent harmful outputs. Sometimes, this \"nerfing\" makes the model too cautious, leading it to bypass complex instructions because it flags them as potentially risky.\n * Quantisation & Optimization: To serve millions of users at a lower cost, companies sometimes use \"quantisation\"—essentially compressing the model. While this makes it faster and cheaper, it can lead to a loss in nuance, logic, and context retention.\n * Context Window Pressure: If the system is trying to handle more concurrent users, the \"effective\" context window might be throttled or the way the model \"summarises\" previous parts of the chat might become more aggressive, leading to those hallucinations you mentioned.\n * The \"Honeymoon\" Phase: At launch, users test simple things and are impressed. As they push the model with more complex, edge-case tasks over time, the inherent flaws of the architecture start to show more clearly.\nIs it actually worse?\nOften, what feels like a decline is actually the \"wall\" of current LLM architecture. Hallucinations usually stem from a model trying to be \"helpful\" by guessing when it doesn't actually have the data in its immediate context.\nI'm curious to know—have you noticed me personally slipping up on specific types of instructions lately, or are you just seeing this trend elsewhere?\nWould you like me to try a complex logic test to see if I can still hold up to your standards?\" \n\nFast 3.0 replying here. Not feeling like testing anything. They seem to  give the same explanations.",
