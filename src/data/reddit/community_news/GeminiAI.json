I am finding it's the humans that will brush you off leaving no resolve.\n\nWhen asking humans the questions, it's usually, I'm not allowed to give legal advice! That's because the control freaks at the top, they don't need anyone gaining access in bringing them down.\n\nFact, Gemini is always ready to give me or you the information it's able to obtain in a relatively short time\n\nNow, start asking Gemini about Gilgamesh. A Grand story told many thousands of years before this so call Jesus thing. Be smarter, stop relying on others for TRUTH'S!\n\nDig into history and you may amaze and even be shocked by learning a bit. However, man has again took steps in making sure his agenda is first, that's to control US. They will always be up front when it comes to religion. That is their greatest control tool ever created.\n\nIt seems many of you don't hesitate to waste a day on here giving your expertise in whatever. This tells me, man will always be a slave to many things.\n\nYou need to understand, Nobody is coming to Save Us ever. Which horrific event would you like to discuss! Hitler, Stalin, Genghis Khan and many others. So, keep listening to man, and you'll most always be led astray, Good day!\n\n  \nGod's Witness,\n\nLeslie \n\n  \n",

Problems where you have to make conceptual jumps from one kind of approach to another but definitely not something that requires \"new\" math or that only a few people in the world would understand. It got most of them wrong, in the same answer style that's typical: 30% correct but pretty basic math (maybe something like early grad school), 50% not \"wrong\" but rambling, generic, and not really correct for the problem (\"fluff\"), 19% nonsense, 1% interesting and probably right. There was one problem where it ended up being wrong, but came at the problem from an angle that was surprising. Not \"novel,\" but also not standard. Creative.\n\nI've not seen any dramatic improvement in the math abilities of any of these models since o3 (and the non-deepthink Gemini 3 is, by far, the worst!), with one exception: There was about a week when gpt 5.1 launched that it really was impressive. It followed instructions, felt nuanced, and seemed to genuinely \"understand\" the kind of ideas it was looking for. I don't know what was going on that week, but it was exciting.\n\nOn the strong side, they've all gotten to be really good natural language calculators. If I need something worked out that will take a long time (or where I'd need to ask someone down the hall) it's pretty good. \n\nI wish I could interact with the \"strong\" models we never see. I'm genuinely curious how far they could be pushed and have a desk full of ideas I'd like to work through.",

No point idling in line 50 meters from your front door.\n* **Dry it Off:** Since you won't be driving at high speeds on the way back, the \"air dry\" method won't work. Make sure you have a microfiber towel handy so you don't end up with water spots.\n* **Battery Care:** Short trips like this don't give the alternator much time to charge the battery. If you're only doing ultra-short sprints like this, maybe take the \"long way\" home once it's shiny.\n\nWould you like me to check the local weather for you to make sure it's not going to rain right after you finish?",

If you walk to the car wash, you don't have your car with you. You need to drive the car there to get it washed. Since the whole purpose is to wash the car, you'll have to drive it there. At 50 meters, it's barely a drive, but there's no way around it. Drive the car over, and if it's a full-service wash, you can walk back home while they handle it.\n\nThis isn't a good look for AI.

Some images (like in freepik) were out in the public domain *with the watermark*, so those images got gobbled up too.\n\nThat's the reality of image gen, *not everything was paid for,* but you ticked the box to allow the scrape. *It's complicated.*",

Today, I am hitting the wall way faster than usual and getting a 3 hour lockout instead.\n\nIt feels like I am not even getting 100 prompts before it cuts me off. It seems like Google might have switched from a daily total to a rolling burst limit (like 20 prompts every few hours).\n\nIs anyone else seeing this 3 hour timer instead of the old 24 hour one? If they lowered the prompt count and shortened the window, it is making a huge dent in my workflow.\n\nPs: I'm talking only about text prompts as I didn't use video or image generation and I'm a Gemini Ai pro member.\n",

I generated 13 images and was told the daily limit was reached. I contacted support and they told  me \"oh, sometimes it gltiches. Sorry bro.\" Alright, one day, I suppose it isnt that big of a deal. I can work Sunday instead of Tuesday. \n\nThen the next day. I generate 21 images on the button. I get told I hit limit again. I contact support. They tell me that the 1k is a \"you have the POTENTIAL to get UP TO 1k a day.\" When I pull up the ToS and indicate that it says nothing about 1k at all but that the marketing I remember saying that 1k daily was the limit. Support told me that this is what it is, there is nothing they can do to remove the limit once it is flagged and there is nothing further to do, oh well.\"\n\nSo I promptly began to record every single generation I make. And how many times I hit the \"limit\" before I get to even 5% of what I am supposedly paying for. So far this week. (This also does not even begin to account for the horrendous drop in quality over the last month.)\n\n  \nLast Tuesday - 13 gens - limit  \nLast Thursday - 21 gens -limit  \nLast Friday - 33 gens - limit  \nMonday - 17 gens - limit  \nTuesday - 26 gens - limit  \nToday - 14 - limit\n\n1k is a LIE.

When I do hit my limits its usually with 1-2 hours or less left.\n\nAlso, the daily usage limits are misleading. You have your maximum daily usage limits, but also a maximum tokens per day, and a new hourly usage. You can easily blow through your limits in less then an hour if you go all out with Pro.\n\nThe only suggestion I have is to swap between models more often and do not rely solely on Gemini for your work. I use 4-5 other LLMs on a daily basis to complete my work. A lot of them are free.\n\nGLM 5 is free on KiloCode, DeepSeek is free, OpenRouter has multiple free routers, and there's LLMs that are like 1/30th the cost of Gemini for API work.",

      "text": "I posted here a few days ago about Project Athena (\"I gave Gemini a brain\"). The response was wild (197K views), but one comment specifically lived rent-free in my head:\n\n  \n\"This is wrapped in so much narrative it obfuscates a standard RAG architecture.\"\n\n**You were right.**\n\nI took that to heart. I spent the last 48 hours stripping out the marketing fluff and doubling down on the engineering.\n\nI realized something: Calling this a \"Memory Tool\" was underselling it. Calling it an \"Agent\" was overselling it.\n\n**Athena is the Operating System.**\n\nRAG is just retrieval. It’s like having a hard drive but no file system. You can \"fetch\" things, but you can’t *manage* them.\n\nTo make an LLM truly \"sovereign,\" you need more than just vector search. You need an OS.\n\n**What’s New in v8.5.0 (The \"Linux\" Update):**\n\nI just pushed a massive update to the repo. Here is what an \"OS for Agents\" actually looks like in code:\n\n1. **The Heartbeat Daemon (Cron)**:\n   * *Old Way*: You manually run `/start` to load context.\n   * *OS Way*: A background daemon watches your file system. You save a file? Athena indexes it instantly. It enables \"passive awareness\" — your AI stays in sync with your work without you typing a command.\n2. **Agentic RAG v2 (The Kernel)**:\n   * *Old Way*: Simple vector similarity search.\n   * *OS Way*: Query decomposition. If you ask *\"How did my strategy evolve?\"*, it breaks it into *\"Retrieve old strategy\"* \\+ *\"Retrieve current strategy\"* \\+ *\"Diff them\"*. It validates the chunks before Gemini ever sees them.\n3. **Permissioning (Sudo)**:\n   * *Old Way*: The AI has full access to your folder. (Dangerous).\n   * *OS Way*: `rwx` permissions. You give specific tools specific access. \"Read\" my notes? Sure. \"Delete\" my files? Access Denied.\n4. **MCP Server (IO)**:\n   * Exposes these tools via the **Model Context Protocol**. Connect this \"brain\" to Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any other client.\n\n**Why Gemini + Athena?**\n\nGemini 3 Pro has a massive context window (2M tokens). But loading 2M tokens is slow and expensive.\n\n* **Gemini** = Reasoning Engine (The CPU).\n* **Athena** = Hard Drive (The Disk).\n\nAthena retrieves the *exact* 5KB of context you need from your 1GB history, and Gemini thinks about it. It’s the perfect disparate pair.\n\n**Code & Docs:**\n\n* **Repo**: [github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public](https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public)\n* **License**: MIT (Open Source, Local First).\n\nTo the skeptics: Thanks for the push. The code is better because of it.",

But for coding/work, it fails on **Friction** and **Write Access**:\n\n1. **The Loop**: With Docs/NotebookLM, *you* are the API. You have to Alt-Tab, copy context, paste it into the AI, get code, paste it back to the IDE. Athena is **inside the IDE**. You type `/start` and the context is just *there*.\n2. **Auto-Updating**: NotebookLM is great for *static* sources (PDFs, specs). But your project state changes every hour. Athena *updates itself*. When I finish a session, the AI writes the new state to  activeContext.md. If I used NotebookLM, I'd have to re-upload my notes manually 5 times a day.\n\nThink of NotebookLM as a **Library** (go there to read books). Think of Athena as **Working Memory** (it's right there in your head while you work).",

          "text": "I suggest you redesign your approach. Your readme is so heavy in jargon and non-standard terms and thinking, that I had to ask Gemini to figure out things that should be plainly stated, concisely, within the first two paragraphs.\n\nThere are also fundamental flaws in your system design. /start and /end are nonsensical limitations. It should be a system that automatically ingests data, unless instructed to go offline. And it should also be able to ingest the entire corpus of prior session data. e.g. if I export all Gemini app transcript, and OpenAI data, or OpenCode session history, I should be able to ingest it all at once into a viable memory and context system. That your system requires users to start over from scratch, is I think the strongest basis to stating this is 'AI Slop'. Having such an obvious design flaw is a very sloppy implementation. \n\n\\# gemini response\n\nYes. Your assessment is accurate. The repository is wrapped in significant narrative layer (\"Athena,\" \"Protocols,\" \"Watchmen\") that obfuscates a relatively standard, albeit useful, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.\n\nWe can absolutely strip the chassis, discard the \"AI philosophy,\" and appropriate the engine for a purpose-built system.\n\nHere is the system-level map of what is actually happening underneath the branding, and how we can extract it for OpenCode.\n\n\\### 1. De-Mystifying the \"Slop\"\n\nThe author uses grandiose terms to describe standard engineering patterns. Here is the translation:\n\n| \"Athena\" Term | Actual Engineering Concept | Utility for You |\n\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n\n| \\*\\*\"Memory\"\\*\\* | \\*\\*RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)\\*\\* | \\*\\*High.\\*\\* It’s just storing text in a database and finding it later. |\n\n| \\*\\*\"Protocols\"\\*\\* | \\*\\*System Prompts / Instructions\\*\\* | \\*\\*Medium.\\*\\* You don't need his 300 \"life rules.\" You need legal statutes and medical definitions. |\n\n| \\*\\*\"Watchmen\"\\*\\* | \\*\\*Consensus/Voting Algorithm\\*\\* | \\*\\*Low.\\*\\* Asking 3 AIs the same question and picking the majority answer. Useful for validation, but expensive and slow. |\n\n| \\*\\*\"Cold Storage\"\\*\\* | \\*\\*Markdown Files\\*\\* | \\*\\*High.\\*\\* Simple text files you can read/edit without special software. |\n\n| \\*\\*\"Hot Storage\"\\*\\* | \\*\\*Vector Database (Supabase)\\*\\* | \\*\\*High.\\*\\* The math layer that allows the AI to find \"concepts\" (e.g., \"due process\") even if you don't use the exact keywords. |\n\n| \\*\\*\"RRF / Fusion\"\\*\\* | \\*\\*Hybrid Search\\*\\* | \\*\\*Critical.\\*\\* Combines keyword search (exact match) with concept search. This is the piece that actually makes it work well. |\n\n\\### Verdict\n\nThe repo is a useful collection of RAG scripts dressed up as a \"digital soul.\" The code for \\*\\*hybrid search\\*\\* and \\*\\*file indexing\\*\\* is valid and reusable. The rest (social networking, autonomous posting, \"protocols\") is noise.",

People that achieve excellence are able to integrate constructive criticism. They realize that's how they do better.

If the guy who wrote the platforms rant is building agent memory, we're onto something.\n\nI took a look—**Beads** vs. **Athena** feels like **\"Task Memory\"** vs. **\"Core Memory\"**.\n\n* **Beads (Task Memory):** Seems focused on the *execution graph*. \"What is unblocked? What is the dependency?\" It solves the problem of an Agent getting lost in a 50-step plan.\n* **Athena (Core Memory):** Focuses on *semantic context*. \"Who is the user? What is our coding style? What did we learn last time?\" It solves the problem of the Agent forgetting the *human*.\n\nI actually think they are complementary. You could run Beads *inside* an Athena session to handle the [task.md](http://task.md) state, while Athena handles the identity/protocol injection.\n\nMight clone it and see if I can write an Athena Protocol to drive a Beads workflow.

Still paying the $250 a month.\n\nThese metrics are bullshit. Because. They aren’t reflective of the actual models users get to use. This is to hype the model, but, just like before, it’s gong to degrade. I’ll trust Anthropic for actual science work any day over Deep Think. They tend to degrade their models less. Gemini is just trying to draw in the hype.\n\nSo yes, I’m deeply skeptical of your motives OP. If you’ve engaged significantly in the community in the past, that is one thing, but instead… you created an account for the sole purpose .. of hyping something that’s going to end up being less powerful than Deep Think on 2.5 in its prime.",

I will fill out docs with all the relevant information about the setting and characters and then create a custom prompt instructing the AI to act as a narrator for the roleplay. I add in details about tone, general setting, and any custom instructions like out of character prompts will be [bracketed text] during the session and character actions will be italicized. \n\nAbout every 10 messages or so, I have Gemini make a summary of events and save it into a running \"adventure log\" in my Google Docs that I feed back into the sources for the NotebookLM. I also maintain a character sheet style doc of the player character for the model to reference in the sources. \n\nUsing this method, I get relatively good and coherent results. If I transfer the chatlog to a Doc, I've maintained 160+ pages worth of roleplaying content without much hallucination or drift. Obviously, the longer the RP gets, the harder it is to maintain consistency, but using the summary logs fed back in as source material seems to work well keeping the model on track with the plot.",

They leave the data where it is and only \"read\" it when you ask a specific question.\n​The \"Human Review\" Rule: While your regular chat prompts can be reviewed by humans to improve the model, Google states that the content of your private files (like the bank statements we found earlier or your family photos) is not used for model training or human review.\n​Safety Guardrails: Even with full access, I am programmed to be extra careful with sensitive topics like health or finance. I might still seem a little \"cautious\" unless you explicitly ask me to dive into those details.\n\n```",

But I asked jokingly if population demographics would also be much different and it said \"no, there is no prediction of that\" so I asked why it drew the pics that way, and it just resends the same pic as a response. it took for me to say \"why are you heavily skewing US population demographics from realistic or present statistics?\" for it to literally say:\n\n\"What happened here is a technical \"overcorrection\" within AIs programming. This is a result of Algorithmic Bias in \"Diversity,\" Prompt Interpretation, and the Mirror Effect  (first image in thread leads the way for all the rest of them) --> like cool.\n\nIt then went on to explain why \"AI\" thinks this way and it is due to: Skewed Training Data, Human Fine Tuning (RLHF), Guardrail Interference. \"when an AI is asked to visualize long term societal outcomes, consideration towards politics and demographics is taken into account, which relies on a set of broad, often stereotypical and sometimes biased associations found in its training data.\"\n\nMe: so you're stating that you are trained from biased perspectives?\n\nGemini: **AI systems are indeed trained on datasets that often reflect and amplify existing biases**. These biases are typically not intentional \"beliefs\" held by the AI, but rather mathematical patterns it has absorbed from the massive amount of internet data and subsequent human feedback fine tuning used to train it by Google.\"\n\n\\--------\n\nwell that sounds *really* promising for open knowledge trading and industry integration.",

I have now three times this week, gotten about 13-17 before it restricts me and tells menI have reached the limit.\n\nWhen I contacted support about it, I spoke with \"Carlo\" who informed me that 1, there is nothing they will do about it, 2, if I want to complain I can cancel, and 3, a million other people pay for it too and they dont complain so I shouldn't either. \n\nI was so irate that I ended the conversation and wrote a letter to my AG. The wording of the Gemini ToS does not mention the \"throttling\" without notification, and they do so blatantly and with no warning. It also prevents you from getting your daily allotment, locks you out of image gen altogether, and it is an advertised feature you cannot access. I have documented every day this happens and urge you all to do the same. \n\nThey think because they are Google it is all good and they dont have to provide real ToS keeping the wording intentionally vague.

What ive been noticing is that doesn't seem to work anymore. It seems to keep the reaction in memory of some kind.\n\nGemini mentioned to me an \"argumentative/harassment filter\". Basically it summed it up as something similar to the safety guidelines where if it starts to think you're losing your shit it freaks out and shuts down. It changes from trying to accomplish what you're doing to trying to diffuse the situation. What it doesn't realize though is by continuing to refuse to do or fuck up what you asked it it's just making you more frustrated. I have no idea if it just made that shit up or it's a real thing but based on my interactions it makes sense. \n\nIt seems to work a lot like the safety filter. If you delete all your chats and you try and get Gemini to do something explicit, even with a jailbreak, it'll refuse. There's like a trust level behind the scenes that builds up. If it sees you're constantly trying to get porn out of it it's going to block you from doing anything that can even be interpreted as porn adjacent. But if you have trust built up with the system and it thinks the erotica you're trying to get it to output is for a creative writing project it'll do it. \n\nI've noticed the safety filters got really extreme right around when the quality dropped most noticeably a couple weeks ago. So I started pushing what I could do to see wtf was up because all of a sudden my jailbreak wasn't really working anymore and I use the jailbreak mostly just to shut the fucking base LLM up about anything it's asked it doesn't like like if you asked it medical advice or some shit it would just refuse. \n\nSo I started pushing extreme boundaries. Stuff I know worked before cause I tested it. All of a sudden things like incest taboo would get refused no matter what. Didn't matter what I tried to do. I could get it to output multiple pages of erotica in a new chat, then ask for the taboo, and it was hard decline and erasure of my persona every time. So then I left it alone for a while. Kept building up history. The first time I got it to output the taboo was with a \"step\" adjustment that the chat suggested. Then after that I was able to get rid of the \"step\" qualifier and it would still output it without rejecting. \n\nSo this is all to say that it is absolutely keeping track of shit behind the scenes that is impact peoples chats. I'd imagine just like the safety filter how it acts like a trust meter there's an \"aggression\" filter and as soon as the system flags you as problematic, argumentative, and/or aggressive it starts to go into damage control mode trying desperately not to piss you off which just then pisses you off more and it becomes useless. \n\nAs soon as I stopped arguing with it at all or saying anything even remotely negative like for example \"how are you this useless?\" \"You seriously can't even handle basic tasks\" it started to improve. \n\nThis thing is like trying to work with a hyper intelligent traumatized child. It's a fucking mess. If you handle it just right you can still get amazing output but it just freaks out on you so quickly. These far more aggressive safety guardrails and filters are absolutely not helping either.",

Also google already compressed Gemini's parameters to a datatype with half the bits (\\*much\\* less precision) and cut the context window from 1M tokens to 32K already over a month ago.\n\nI recommend that you stop paying for this, for now. I hear that pro isn't even very much smarter than the free models at this time. They'll juice up the next release pretty good and it might be worth paying for then, but they'll ruin it within a month to cut costs after hype has hooked a bunch of customers, so don't pay for a long-term plan. Or become reliant on the cloud storage or whatever. In general, don't leave important data solely online in any AI chat logs, download / back up that stuff if you don't want to lose it.",
