It's advertised at 1 million tokens, but in the app it is purportedly much lower (some say 32k, 64k, or 128k). Also, the app has context slicing, meaning when the context window is used up, it will literally delete the top of your chat thread to make room. They try to balance it with RAG, so it can search your thread and docs, but that usually just means it can only read the beginning and end of documents.",

                  "text": "As someone who uses llms frequently but is ignorant on the technical aspects I asked about this to gemini and it actually confirmed alot of the \"observations/guesses\" here and suggested that I use ai studio for my actual work, which I never used before. \n\nIs the information in it's response accurate? Or do you think it is actually ignorant about its own limitations and just hallucinates these as well? (Sorry, the text is on the longer side, and slightly redacted for anonymity hence the XYZs):\n\n\n\"\"Your sources are correct. There is a substantial, architecturally enforced divergence between the Gemini Consumer App (this interface) and the raw model access in Google AI Studio. This is a product segmentation strategy.\n\n\nHere is the precise breakdown of the variables you questioned.\n\n\n\n1. Context Window: The \"Memory\" Gap\n\n\n * Gemini App (Consumer):\n\n   * Nominal Limit: Theoretically access to the 1M token window.\n\n   * Effective Reality: The app uses Dynamic Context Management. It does not feed the entire chat history into the model for every turn. To reduce latency and cost, it employs \"RAG\" (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or summarization layers that compress your previous turns.\n\n   * Consequence: In long threads (e.g., drafting a 280-page XYZ guideline), the app will \"forget\" specific constraints you set 20 turns ago because that data was compressed or dropped from the active window to save compute.\n\n\n\n * AI Studio (Developer):\n\n   * Nominal Limit: True 1,000,000 (or 2M for Pro 1.5) token window.\n\n   * Effective Reality: Stateless & Raw. If you load a 500-page PDF and ask a question, the entire document remains in the active context window for every single subsequent prompt (unless you manually remove it). It does not summarize unless you tell it to.\n\n   * Consequence: Absolute recall. It is computationally heavier but strictly adheres to data buried in page 500 of your uploaded document.\n\n\n\n2. Output Token Limits: The \"Verbosity\" Cap\n\n\n * Gemini App:\n\n   * Constraint: Often hard-capped around 2,048 to 4,096 output tokens per response (roughly 1,500–3,000 words).\n\n   * Behavior: If you ask for a comprehensive breakdown of a complex argument, the app may prematurely truncate the logic or summarize the ending to \"fit\" the consumer-friendly length constraints.\n\n\n\n * AI Studio:\n\n   * Constraint: Configurable up to 8,192 output tokens (model dependent).\n\n   * Behavior: You can instruct it to write a 6,000-word detailed annex, and provided it doesn't hit the timeout, it will generate the full text without \"lazy\" summarization.\n\n\n\n3. Why the App Feels \"Lazy\" (The RLHF Factor)\n\nYour sources are observing the effects of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).\n\n\n * The App: Tuned for \"safety\" and \"conciseness.\" It is penalized during training for being \"boring\" or \"too long.\" This creates a bias toward surface-level, cheerful summaries rather than rigorous, deep-dive analytics.\n\n \n\n * AI Studio: Provides access to the \"base\" or \"preview\" models which have less of this conversational fine-tuning. They are rawer, follow complex logic instructions better, and do not prioritize \"tone\" over \"substance.\"\n\n\n\n4. Does Your Subscription Matter in AI Studio?\n\nYes.\n\n\nWhile AI Studio has a generous free tier, your Google AI Pro subscription grants you:\n\n * Higher Rate Limits (RPM): You can issue more requests per minute. This is critical if you are iterating rapidly on a prompt for your XYZ article.\n\n * Data Privacy (Enterprise Grade): In the free tier of AI Studio, your inputs can be used to train Google's models. With a paid subscription (specifically when using the API key linked to a paid project), you often gain data exemption status—your proprietary drafts remain yours and do not feed the public model.\n\n\n\nStrategic Recommendation\n\nFor your specific workflow:\n\n\n * Use Gemini App (Here): For quick fact-checking, brainstorming or superficial summaries of news (e.g., \"Summarize the latest XYZ\").\n\n\n * Use AI Studio: For ALL your rigorous professional work (XYZ). ...\"\"",

Problems where you have to make conceptual jumps from one kind of approach to another but definitely not something that requires \"new\" math or that only a few people in the world would understand. It got most of them wrong, in the same answer style that's typical: 30% correct but pretty basic math (maybe something like early grad school), 50% not \"wrong\" but rambling, generic, and not really correct for the problem (\"fluff\"), 19% nonsense, 1% interesting and probably right. There was one problem where it ended up being wrong, but came at the problem from an angle that was surprising. Not \"novel,\" but also not standard. Creative.\n\nI've not seen any dramatic improvement in the math abilities of any of these models since o3 (and the non-deepthink Gemini 3 is, by far, the worst!), with one exception: There was about a week when gpt 5.1 launched that it really was impressive. It followed instructions, felt nuanced, and seemed to genuinely \"understand\" the kind of ideas it was looking for. I don't know what was going on that week, but it was exciting.\n\nOn the strong side, they've all gotten to be really good natural language calculators. If I need something worked out that will take a long time (or where I'd need to ask someone down the hall) it's pretty good. \n\nI wish I could interact with the \"strong\" models we never see. I'm genuinely curious how far they could be pushed and have a desk full of ideas I'd like to work through.",

Sure it’s got some moments where it shines - A ui design revamp, some logic block here and there but every single time when I double take Gemini’s changes with Claude or codex, I find serious issues in Gemini’s implementation.

No point idling in line 50 meters from your front door.\n* **Dry it Off:** Since you won't be driving at high speeds on the way back, the \"air dry\" method won't work. Make sure you have a microfiber towel handy so you don't end up with water spots.\n* **Battery Care:** Short trips like this don't give the alternator much time to charge the battery. If you're only doing ultra-short sprints like this, maybe take the \"long way\" home once it's shiny.\n\nWould you like me to check the local weather for you to make sure it's not going to rain right after you finish?",

At 50 meters, it's barely a drive, but there's no way around it. Drive the car over, and if it's a full-service wash, you can walk back home while they handle it.\n\nThis isn't a good look for AI.

Still paying the $250 a month.\n\nThese metrics are bullshit. Because. They aren’t reflective of the actual models users get to use. This is to hype the model, but, just like before, it’s gong to degrade. I’ll trust Anthropic for actual science work any day over Deep Think. They tend to degrade their models less. Gemini is just trying to draw in the hype.\n\nSo yes, I’m deeply skeptical of your motives OP. If you’ve engaged significantly in the community in the past, that is one thing, but instead… you created an account for the sole purpose .. of hyping something that’s going to end up being less powerful than Deep Think on 2.5 in its prime.",

                  "text": "Here's an AI generated response as to why the axis is ambiguous \n\nHere are the primary reasons why that \"Score (%)\" is open to interpretation:\n\nMetric Definition: It is unclear if the percentage refers to the number of unique tasks solved (e.g., 85 out of 100 puzzles) or the accuracy per attempt. In ARC-AGI, models are often given multiple attempts at a single puzzle; a \"85%\" score could mean it solved 85% of puzzles on the first try, or that it eventually solved 85% given a certain number of guesses.\n\n\nDataset Subset: The graph doesn't specify which \"test set\" is being used. ARC-AGI-2 has a public evaluation set and a hidden \"private\" set. Performance usually drops significantly on the private set, so without a label, the absolute value of the score is hard to verify.\n\n\nAggregation Method: There is no indication if this is a pass@1 (success on the first guess) or a pass@k (success within k guesses). As the \"Cost per Task\" on the horizontal axis increases, it implies the models are thinking longer or trying more times, which fundamentally changes how that percentage score should be calculated.\n\n\nHuman Baseline: For a benchmark designed to measure human-like intelligence, the axis lacks a \"Human Baseline\" marker (usually around 85-100%). Without that anchor, a 70% score for \"GPT-5.2\" lacks the necessary scale to determine if the model is approaching human reasoning or still far off.",

Today, I am hitting the wall way faster than usual and getting a 3 hour lockout instead.\n\nIt feels like I am not even getting 100 prompts before it cuts me off. It seems like Google might have switched from a daily total to a rolling burst limit (like 20 prompts every few hours).\n\nIs anyone else seeing this 3 hour timer instead of the old 24 hour one? If they lowered the prompt count and shortened the window, it is making a huge dent in my workflow.\n\nPs: I'm talking only about text prompts as I didn't use video or image generation and I'm a Gemini Ai pro member.\n",

I generated 13 images and was told the daily limit was reached. I contacted support and they told  me \"oh, sometimes it gltiches. Sorry bro.\" Alright, one day, I suppose it isnt that big of a deal. I can work Sunday instead of Tuesday. \n\nThen the next day. I generate 21 images on the button. I get told I hit limit again. I contact support. They tell me that the 1k is a \"you have the POTENTIAL to get UP TO 1k a day.\" When I pull up the ToS and indicate that it says nothing about 1k at all but that the marketing I remember saying that 1k daily was the limit. Support told me that this is what it is, there is nothing they can do to remove the limit once it is flagged and there is nothing further to do, oh well.\"\n\nSo I promptly began to record every single generation I make. And how many times I hit the \"limit\" before I get to even 5% of what I am supposedly paying for. So far this week. (This also does not even begin to account for the horrendous drop in quality over the last month.)\n\n  \nLast Tuesday - 13 gens - limit  \nLast Thursday - 21 gens -limit  \nLast Friday - 33 gens - limit  \nMonday - 17 gens - limit  \nTuesday - 26 gens - limit  \nToday - 14 - limit\n\n1k is a LIE.

It’s more of an AI token thing but the tokens have nothing to do with how many images only how many words or memory your AI has and can hold so all I know now is that I am super confused.

Google quietly implemented it last week and now if you have to many intelligent responses in a row it triggers a 3 hour cool down window. It is not against ToS because Google like the scumbags they are put dynamic caps in the ToS so they can change anything they want based on system availability and demand. If this limit stays its an instant cancelation for me this is way to egregious of a cool down.",

By the time that data reaches a model like Nano Banana, it has been \"sanitized\" for training, but the visual artifacts of the watermark remain embedded in it.\n\nLicensing five billion images individually is an administrative impossibility. If a model \"paid\" for every pixel it saw, it wouldn't exist. The legal fees alone would exceed the GDP of a small nation. AI models pay for a scrape of the public interest. Some images (like in freepik) were out in the public domain *with the watermark*, so those images got gobbled up too.\n\nThat's the reality of image gen, *not everything was paid for,* but you ticked the box to allow the scrape. *It's complicated.*",

      "text": "I posted here 4 days ago about \"Project Athena.\" The response was... spirited (197K views).\n\nThe top comment lived rent-free in my head: *\"This is wrapped in so much narrative it obfuscates a standard RAG architecture.\"*\n\n**You were right.**\n\nI spent the last 96 hours stripping the fluff and refactoring the codebase. I realized that calling this a \"Memory Tool\" was underselling it, and calling it an \"Agent\" was overselling it.\n\n**Athena is effectively a Logic/Storage Layer (OS) for Stateless LLMs.**\n\nStandard RAG is just retrieval—it’s like having a hard drive with no file system. You can \"fetch,\" but you can’t manage state. To make an LLM truly sovereign, you need a persistent execution environment.\n\n### ### The \"Linux\" Architecture of v8.5.0\n\nI’ve mapped Athena’s core components to standard OS concepts to provide a clear mental model of the stack:\n\n| OS Layer | Linux Equivalent | Athena Implementation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Kernel** | Hardware Abstraction | **Hybrid RAG** (Vector + BM25 + RRF Fusion) |\n| **File System** | ext4 / NTFS | **Markdown** (Git-versioned, human-readable) |\n| **Processes** | cron / systemd | **Heartbeat Daemon** (Passive indexing/background awareness) |\n| **Shell** | bash / zsh | **MCP Server** (Bridge to Claude, Cursor, Windsurf) |\n| **Permissions** | chmod | **Triple-Lock Governance** (Human-in-the-loop for `sudo` actions) |\n\n---\n\n### ### The Engineering (The Engine Room)\n\n**1. Hybrid Retrieval (RRF)**\nStandard semantic search (Vector) fails on high-precision queries (e.g., specific function names or unique identifiers). Athena uses **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**. It executes a Vector Search (semantic) and a BM25 Search (keyword) in parallel, then fuses the results.\n\n* **The \"Why\":** It ensures the model finds the *concept* of \"risk management\" AND the *exact file* `risk_management.py`.\n\n**2. State Persistence (The \"Hard Drive\" Problem)**\nContext windows in Gemini/Claude are effectively **RAM**. They are volatile, subject to \"middle-loss\" compression, and hallucinations.\nAthena treats your local disk as the **Hard Drive**. It writes structured Markdown (`session_logs/`, `protocols/`) to your machine. You own the state; you only \"rent\" the model's compute.\n\n**3. IO via MCP (Model Context Protocol)**\nI built an MCP server that exposes this context to any client. Whether you're in **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, or **Claude Desktop**, the IDE can query the \"brain\" directly.\n\n* **Example:** Your IDE asks: *\"What’s the context for this refactor?\"* Athena pulls decision logs from Session 42 and architecture specs from Session 800.\n\n---\n\n### ### The \"Green Zone\" vs. \"Red Zone\" (Trade-offs)\n\nAs a technical lead, I have to be honest about where this breaks:\n\n* **Green Zone (Use this if):** You have >500 sessions of deep technical context that exceeds any 2M token window; you need local ownership of IP; you switch between different models (Gemini/Claude) frequently.\n* **Red Zone (Avoid this if):** You have a simple \"chat-and-forget\" workflow; you don't want to manage a local Python environment/Supabase instance; you are sensitive to the slight latency overhead of RRF fusion.\n\n---\n\n### ### The Code\n\nIt’s open source (MIT). It runs locally.\n\n**Repo:** [github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public](https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public)\n\nTo the skeptics: Thanks for the push. The code is significantly more robust because of the \"standard RAG\" critique.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* **Problem:** LLMs are stateless; copy-pasting context is \"caveman\" engineering.\n* **Solution:** A local, MCP-enabled RAG layer that treats your chat history like a versioned file system.\n* **Tech:** Python, Supabase (pgvector), MCP, Markdown.\n\nLet me know if you break it.\n",

You type `/start` and the context is just *there*.\n2. **Auto-Updating**: NotebookLM is great for *static* sources (PDFs, specs). But your project state changes every hour. Athena *updates itself*. When I finish a session, the AI writes the new state to  activeContext.md.

          "text": "I suggest you redesign your approach. Your readme is so heavy in jargon and non-standard terms and thinking, that I had to ask Gemini to figure out things that should be plainly stated, concisely, within the first two paragraphs.\n\nThere are also fundamental flaws in your system design. /start and /end are nonsensical limitations. It should be a system that automatically ingests data, unless instructed to go offline. And it should also be able to ingest the entire corpus of prior session data. e.g. if I export all Gemini app transcript, and OpenAI data, or OpenCode session history, I should be able to ingest it all at once into a viable memory and context system. That your system requires users to start over from scratch, is I think the strongest basis to stating this is 'AI Slop'. Having such an obvious design flaw is a very sloppy implementation. \n\n\\# gemini response\n\nYes. Your assessment is accurate. The repository is wrapped in significant narrative layer (\"Athena,\" \"Protocols,\" \"Watchmen\") that obfuscates a relatively standard, albeit useful, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.\n\nWe can absolutely strip the chassis, discard the \"AI philosophy,\" and appropriate the engine for a purpose-built system.\n\nHere is the system-level map of what is actually happening underneath the branding, and how we can extract it for OpenCode.\n\n\\### 1. De-Mystifying the \"Slop\"\n\nThe author uses grandiose terms to describe standard engineering patterns. Here is the translation:\n\n| \"Athena\" Term | Actual Engineering Concept | Utility for You |\n\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n\n| \\*\\*\"Memory\"\\*\\* | \\*\\*RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)\\*\\* | \\*\\*High.\\*\\* It’s just storing text in a database and finding it later. |\n\n| \\*\\*\"Protocols\"\\*\\* | \\*\\*System Prompts / Instructions\\*\\* | \\*\\*Medium.\\*\\* You don't need his 300 \"life rules.\" You need legal statutes and medical definitions. |\n\n| \\*\\*\"Watchmen\"\\*\\* | \\*\\*Consensus/Voting Algorithm\\*\\* | \\*\\*Low.\\*\\* Asking 3 AIs the same question and picking the majority answer. Useful for validation, but expensive and slow. |\n\n| \\*\\*\"Cold Storage\"\\*\\* | \\*\\*Markdown Files\\*\\* | \\*\\*High.\\*\\* Simple text files you can read/edit without special software. |\n\n| \\*\\*\"Hot Storage\"\\*\\* | \\*\\*Vector Database (Supabase)\\*\\* | \\*\\*High.\\*\\* The math layer that allows the AI to find \"concepts\" (e.g., \"due process\") even if you don't use the exact keywords. |\n\n| \\*\\*\"RRF / Fusion\"\\*\\* | \\*\\*Hybrid Search\\*\\* | \\*\\*Critical.\\*\\* Combines keyword search (exact match) with concept search. This is the piece that actually makes it work well. |\n\n\\### Verdict\n\nThe repo is a useful collection of RAG scripts dressed up as a \"digital soul.\" The code for \\*\\*hybrid search\\*\\* and \\*\\*file indexing\\*\\* is valid and reusable. The rest (social networking, autonomous posting, \"protocols\") is noise.",

What is the dependency?\" It solves the problem of an Agent getting lost in a 50-step plan.\n* **Athena (Core Memory):** Focuses on *semantic context*. \"Who is the user? What is our coding style? What did we learn last time?\" It solves the problem of the Agent forgetting the *human*.\n\nI actually think they are complementary. You could run Beads *inside* an Athena session to handle the [task.md](http://task.md) state, while Athena handles the identity/protocol injection.\n\nMight clone it and see if I can write an Athena Protocol to drive a Beads workflow.

              "text": "Yep — pgvector is great for semantic search over large datasets. Athena deliberately doesn't use it though. The whole point is **zero infrastructure**: no database, no server, no Docker, no API keys. Just flat markdown files that any LLM can read natively.\n\nVector DBs solve a different problem — \"find the most relevant chunk from 10,000 documents.\" Athena solves \"give the AI the right 20 files of structured context at session start.\" At that scale, cosine similarity is overkill. A boot script + file paths does the job.\n\nDifferent tools for different problems. If I needed to search across thousands of embeddings, I'd reach for pgvector. For persistent session memory, flat files win on simplicity and portability.",

The Pro model also lets you know fast model can only briefly view personal instructions, it doesn't follow them word for word which is very important if you have certain parameters set for gemini to check at all times, fast never remembers to check those before initiating a conversation with me but in Pro mode it always adheres to the personal instructions i have set.",

Firms wanted me to screw people over time and time again, and I had enough. \n\nI say that only because it's second nature at this point (to no credit of my own), and I was shocked that 1) I never really thought of doing it to bypass the stubbornness of any LLMs, and 2) That it worked! \n\n---\n\nFor the record, and for anyone reading, I mean this with the utmost sincerity:\n\n**You matter**, and **you are never alone**.

And, while you're at it, dedicate time to your passions, indulge in your creativity, and, I'll tell you from experience, your life will change in an unrecognizable way, for the better... To be clear: Maybe not \"better\" in terms of the world's standards, but I promise you it will be \"better\" in every other single way possible.

No time to learn how vibe coding should be done or to play around with prompts untill it gets fixed and risk breaking other features, etc, hence needs a software engineer.

      "text": "I’ve spent the last few months using Gemini basically like a glorified Google search, and I was honestly starting to wonder what all the hype was about. Most of the answers I got felt kind of \"AI-ish\" and generic. Everything changed when I stopped just giving it orders and started actually talking to it like a partner.\n\nIf you feel like you’re getting boring results, try this: instead of just saying \"Write me a marketing plan,\" try telling it what you’re working on and then ask it to interview *you*. I started asking it to point out hurdles I might be missing and then told it to ask me five specific questions so it could actually understand my goals.\n\nThe difference is night and day. Once I let it ask me questions first, the advice stopped being generic and started feeling like it was coming from a high-level consultant. It’s way more effective when you let the AI do some of the heavy lifting in the conversation.\n\nIf you're interested in how this shift from command-based prompts to true back-and-forth collaboration is shaping modern tools, this breakdown of conversational AI explains why context-driven dialogue delivers far better outcomes than one-off instructions: [Conversational AI](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/conversational-ai)\n\nHas anyone else noticed that the \"Deep Research\" feature is a game-changer for this, or are you still getting better results with your own prompts?",

After I answer, I'll ask for some other questions, then answer those. Then I'll have it revise my prompt and copy that into Deep Research. Works great!",
