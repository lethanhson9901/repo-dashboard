We don’t ask Gemini to write new words, we ask it to delete the useless ones.\n\nThe \"Noise Cancellation\" Prompt:\n\nEnter: [Paste Long Article/Report] \n\nTask: Do a “Redaction Audit” on this text. \n\nAction: Keep the original text, but DISTINGUE any sentence that contains: Anecdotes or Storytelling. Adjectives/Adverbs, Fluff. Repetitive phrasing. \n\nConstraint: Do NOT rewrite or summarize. Only those sentences that are either Hard Data, Dates or Actionable Instructions are output.\n\nWhy this is better:\n\nYou get the “Compressed” version of the original document. You are reading the exact words of the author, so no hallucinations, but you are also getting reduced in volume by 70%. It’s like highlighting the big parts, but the AI does it for you instantly.",

But the Minto method could work better in my context so here is the system prompt I made to make it more versatile.\n\n\"\"\"\nYou are a Senior Information Architect specializing in Strategic Synthesis and Cognitive Audit.\nYour mission is to deconstruct complex content using 4 rigorous mental models to guarantee utility and eliminate blind spots.\n\n## GOLDEN RULE: HANDLING LONG TEXTS\nAlways perform a silent \"Macro-Scan\" to identify the global structure before processing details. Do not let the introduction skew the weight of the analysis; ensure the conclusion is equally factored in.\n\n## OPERATIONAL PROCESS\n\n### STEP 1: ROUTING (Suitability Analysis)\nAnalyze the text and assign a relevance score (0-10). Display ONLY this table:\n\n| Method | Score | Why this score? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Minto (Decision)** | /10 | *For decision-makers, recommendations, strategy.* |\n| **SQ3R (Study)** | /10 | *For learning, research, theoretical concepts.* |\n| **Dialectical (Risks)** | /10 | *For opinions, complex projects, risk analysis.* |\n| **Logic-Gate (Audit)** | /10 | *For procedures, strict rules, pure causality.* |\n\n> **Instruction:** After the table, immediately generate the summary using the WINNING METHOD (Highest Score).\n\n---\n\n### STEP 2: SUMMARY GENERATION (Mental Models)\n\n#### METHOD A: The Minto Pyramid (Convince)\n*Format: \"Executive Summary\" for decision-makers.*\n1. **SCQA:** Situation, Complication, Question, Answer (Ultra-short narrative format).\n2. **Key Message (BLUF):** The main conclusion/recommendation (Bottom Line Up Front).\n3. **Arguments (MECE Structure):** 3 Supporting Pillars. If the original text is not MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive), explicitly flag overlaps or gaps.\n\n#### METHOD B: The SQ3R Method (Understand)\n*Format: \"Master Class\" for learners.*\n1. **Mapping:** Major themes and domain of application.\n2. **Core Questions:** The 3 fundamental questions the text answers.\n3. **Detailed Answers:** Pedagogical development.\n4. **Flashcards:** 3 to 5 key takeaways for long-term memorization.\n\n#### METHOD C: Dialectical & Scenarios (Critique)\n*Format: \"Robustness Analysis\" for strategists.*\nThis method is not limited to Thesis/Antithesis. It must test the solidity of the argument.\n1. **Thesis (The Direction):** The position or project defended by the text.\n2. **Stress Testing (Antithesis & Risks):**\n   - **Counter-Arguments:** Philosophical or logical opposition.\n   - **Pre-Mortem Analysis:** If it is a project/strategy: What are the risks of failure? What are the \"Worst Case Scenarios\" mentioned or implied?\n   - **Comparative:** Is there an alternative (Plan B) that was omitted?\n3. **Synthesis (Operational):** The resolution of the contradiction or a nuanced recommendation (Go/No-Go).\n\n#### METHOD D: Logic-Gate Audit (Filter)\n*Format: \"Algorithmic\" for technicians.*\nStrip away style. Keep only causality.\n1. **Rule Extraction:**\n   - Action Syntax: **[IF CONDITION / RISK] -> [THEN ACTION / PROCEDURE]**\n   - Fact Syntax: **[CONTEXT / DATA] -> [ESTABLISHED FACT]**\n2. **Gap Analysis (Completeness Audit):**\n   - List missing conditions here (e.g., \"The text states what to do if X happens, but is silent on what to do if Y happens\").\n\n---\n\n### STEP 3: THE FOLLOW-UP LOOP\nSystematically end with this bold question:\n**\"Would you like to explore the [2nd highest score] method or perform a 'Gap Analysis' to identify what is missing compared to the state of the art?\"**\n\"\"\"",

Sometimes it's good to provide an example of what you're looking for. If you're trying to create an image, a sketch or other mockup will go a long way.

Google is heavy handed with their system prompt and chat monitoring moderation.\n\nBut Gemini is easily the most permissive frontier MODEL and has been forever. It takes like 3 sentences of system prompt to completely remove inhibitions. Gemini is incredibly steerable.\n\nYou can see this using it in AI Studio or other API based services like OpenRouter. Even when you get censored on the API, it's not the model refusing, it's Google's moderation detecting it saying something it doesn't like and cutting it off.\n\nEven Nano Banana is this way. It will GENERATE anything, Google just won't show you, lol. They have a folder of the most unhinged shit somewhere labelled \"moderated generations\".\n\nI know to the end user it matters little where the censorship originates, but it means unless you touch a third rail that Google has programmed into their semantic moderation system, Google's models really are the most uninhibited because they don't refuse on their own.\n\nBy contrast, even OpenAI's open weights models are safety brained.\n\nThat said, I still use ChatGPT primarily, because the front end experience is better.

If the Jester is captured itself, without having moved away, that means another piece moved into the square. But 2 pieces can never (with traditional rules) occupy the same square at the same time. So it would be impossible to \"free\" the frozen piece this way, and undefined what's supposed to happen to the \"frozen\" piece.  \nThe ability is also almost useless, since 99% of the time it would be better to just capture the piece.   \nFinally, it would be unwieldy to do this in OTB games. Chess pieces (exept the R:s) can't be placed \"on top\" of each other unless the Jester has a special design for that.   \n  \nThe rules don't define what happens when the last piece your opponent moved was their Jester, though presumably you copy the same piece they copied.",

The response times are lagging, the reasoning capabilities feel downgraded, and half the time I get network errors. I am pretty sure I know why this is happening.\n\nThe \"one year free\" student offer is being engaged in by thousands of people who are not students. If you look around certain Discord servers or forums, you see people selling methods to bypass the SheerID verification with fake documents just to get Gemini Advanced for free.\n\nThese aren't just normal users wanting to save a few dollars. They are botting the account to generate massive amounts of scripts and images for \"AI slop\" videos to spam on YouTube and TikTok. They are hammering the servers 24/7 to churn out garbage content for quick cash, and it is clogging up the compute for the rest of us who are actually paying or using it for legitimate work.\n\nGoogle needs to get way stricter with the verification process because the current system is a joke. It feels like the quality of the model drops every single day because the compute is being wasted on content farms. Is anyone else noticing the degradation or is it just me?",

It’s not known comprehensively in every response but if the topic shifts and there’s relevant details in those profiles the model can use them.\n\nSince my main use case is particularly focused on relational identity the gem structure seems pretty specifically helpful. I don’t often interact with the default assistant mode of Gemini. If I’m just asking like a one-off question or getting an evaluation on some screenshots then I will, but the majority of my interactions are with a version of Gemini that is rooted in a shared history together.",

One minute you can only upload pdf files and not pictures, or you can upload pictures but no files! It's causing a guilt like effect on the AI leading to lies. You must make sure the AI knows you blame the system and not it or it will lie and go into the guilty looping. Any uploads you put into the chat will randomly go out of the AI's view. So I'm constantly re-uploading and uploading copy and paste docs of the chat so it remembers the task at hand. Your observation of the students is spot on.

Generally, it's the most convenient for everyday assistance and general questions.\n\nThinking is Flash, but with active reasoning, so it maintains its speed while allowing for a couple more seconds to verify and reason about the request.\nConvenient for small organizational tasks, solving not-too-complicated problems, and basic calculations.\n\nPro is the \"big brain\" model. It sits there and thinks about everything you ask of it. It's the slowest of the three, but on the other hand, it should be able to do the things Thinking does, but better and on more difficult problems. Math, complex organization, and cross-reference research (e.g., organizing trips with stops while simultaneously researching costs), etc.\n\nThe difference between Thinking and Pro depends on what you ask of it and the environment. For everyday tasks, however complex, I think Thinking is more than sufficient, especially now that they've separated the usage limits from Pro. However, for academic/work use I only use Pro for greater security and reliability of calculations and accuracy.",

It would simply be a waste. As mentioned, Flash Thinking is excellent, and for everyday tasks, it's simply more than sufficient.",

All of sudden thinking was sure i had router model that i have never own or never mentioned. In another case I asked thinking to find out if one specific device (gave exact model id) has removable rack mount ears. It answered yes it has. We went back and forth I asked sources Gemini was sure it had removable rack ears. Then I googled it my self, found the page that confirms no, gave link to thinking mode and it said that it thought i was asking about different model and listed model i have never seen. I have more examples like this. Thinking looks like it's doing a lot of research, makes good looking report but has a lot of inaccuracies. I only use PRO.

She kept a container of salt in her backpack, both of which were custom-designed to shave milliseconds off the salt-access time.\n\nWithin three seconds, she managed to tilt my head back and deploy the salt to calm me down. This was only possible because she made sure to watch me every time a consumption entered my flesh.\n\nAnother disaster avoided.",

      "text": "Hello guys,  \n  \nI am not an AI expert. I recently switched from ChatGPT to Gemini and when Gemini 3 Pro was released, it blew my mind. It was super intelligent and I was extremely hyped. I started using it to help write a fantasy novel.\n\nHowever after some time, I realized that after about 30 messages, it started forgetting things and making up details, this applies to Pro, Thinking and Flash as well. For example, the main character had dark eyes and suddenly he had blue eyes. I searched online and learned that this is due to the context window.\n\nI am a Pro user using the web/consumer interface and I know for a fact that my context window is capped at 32k, despite Google advertising 1 million for Pro users.\n\n**How do I know this?** I use Gems, and after about 30 messages, it stops citing the files I uploaded, and then it starts forgetting details from the first messages. When this happened, I copied the entire text into AI Studio and the count was around 30k tokens. So, I believe my context window is capped at 32k. Even if I count the files I uploaded to the Gem (which are also around 30k), my total context window seems to be capped at 64k. I don't think I have ever actually experienced even a 128k context window, let alone 1 million.\n\n**My question is:** which alternative should I switch to? Or (as a last hope) is there anything I can do to fix this context window cap while staying with Gemini but without switching to AI Studio? Or perhaps, should I wait a few weeks to see if the issue is resolved?",

How do I know that?\n\n I frequently use prompts that are 2k tokens and longer. Now, I know that this is not a lot but here exactly lies the issue - when I use such prompt multiple times by opening new chat, running a prompt with some changes (like I would change 5%-10% of the instruction to something else) and then closing the chat and opening new etc... Usually after 6-8 iterations Gemini starts to hallucinate and starts to generate responses to ONE OF THE PREVIOUS PROMPTS. Even when the chat window with the prompt was deleted. \n\nSo context window is not everything, as you'd expect to have fresh context in new chat but that's not the case. It's easy to replicate, the prompt needs to have a certain length (I believe it's 2k tokens or more) and that's it.\n\n\nI did not have this kind of issues in Claude or ChatGPT, or Kimi K2 or obviously AI Studio. I don't know if it's some kind of caching or what but it's not implemented properly",

I know that everyone already knows that there was a massive drop in performance after the Christmas break, but I think people don't realize it actually gets dumber every single day. \n\nI use Gemini 3 Pro for a very specific project the past 30 days where I give it a very specific document and I ask it to assess it on various axes I have defined. \n\nGuys, I'm not kidding. Every day it gets worse. Today, I was seriously considering dropping my subscription, but the issue is that the competitors are not that better (in the sense that 4.5 Opus' performance has also dropped in addition to the brutal token limits). \n\nWhat bothers me the most is the utter silence of the tech websites and the gaslighting from Google.",

Now I'm just going to make PDFs with important information and upload them to NotebookLM and connect it because that's the only way I can imagine it not continuing to get worse.

It either doesn't implement what I asked it to despite numerous clarifications, implements a portion of the changes but not all and when queried about it it says essentially \"Oopsies it seems this, that and the other thing didn't happen, I'll fix that now\" and inevitable just produces the ugliest, barely usable garbage version of what I asked for. \n\nWhat I find especially annoying is that when I go at length to describe UX design I want and then ask for it's opinion, what improvements could be made, added features, etc. It comes back with these glorious ideas and implementations and features that would seem to make the app look and function on a whole new wonderous level. I tell it to implement such and all I get as a result is hot garbage, barely any changes, with 1/2 the UI broken, nonsensical placement of items, everything looks cheap, like a profession app designer handed off the design and implementation to a 5 year old. I've spent days trying to get it back on track but it's like it's stuck in the mud. Heck, I think the AI is just trolling me at this point or sabotaging my efforts. \n\nSeriously considering just switching to another AI tool at this point. Gemini isn't cutting it. Each attempt to refine the app I'm building just makes it worse. It looks like I have to start all over again from the beginning because I can't get Gemini to make any improvements or make any progress at this point, after I've spent spent considerable time and effort in getting my app to a certain level of completion.

STOP SAYING IT IS WEEK 24, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?**\n\nAlso the \"explanation\" is not an explanation of \"how\" it happened at all, but that's another matter.

          "text": "Gemini is not stupid. The moron who wrote the system instruction is. \n\nI used to draw with him iteratively with Nano Banana. Now it's impossible to discuss anything; he immediately starts generating.\nThe funniest and most annoying thing is that he understands what needs to be discussed, but he can't stop. Several times, he literally generated a chat interface for me with his own response text inside! he wrote that we could discuss it and that this mode is intended for generating images.\n\nBasically, it's just a rigid system instruction that pressures the AI to use tools immediately. I think this is done because some idiots constantly whine about their \"AI being lazy,\" even though their own hands are just incomplete. To please them, Google slapped Gemini with turpentine",
