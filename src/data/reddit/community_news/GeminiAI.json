Also, the app has context slicing, meaning when the context window is used up, it will literally delete the top of your chat thread to make room. They try to balance it with RAG, so it can search your thread and docs, but that usually just means it can only read the beginning and end of documents.",

Or do you think it is actually ignorant about its own limitations and just hallucinates these as well? (Sorry, the text is on the longer side, and slightly redacted for anonymity hence the XYZs):\n\n\n\"\"Your sources are correct. There is a substantial, architecturally enforced divergence between the Gemini Consumer App (this interface) and the raw model access in Google AI Studio. This is a product segmentation strategy.\n\n\nHere is the precise breakdown of the variables you questioned.\n\n\n\n1. Context Window: The \"Memory\" Gap\n\n\n * Gemini App (Consumer):\n\n   * Nominal Limit: Theoretically access to the 1M token window.\n\n   * Effective Reality: The app uses Dynamic Context Management. It does not feed the entire chat history into the model for every turn. To reduce latency and cost, it employs \"RAG\" (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or summarization layers that compress your previous turns.\n\n   * Consequence: In long threads (e.g., drafting a 280-page XYZ guideline), the app will \"forget\" specific constraints you set 20 turns ago because that data was compressed or dropped from the active window to save compute.\n\n\n\n * AI Studio (Developer):\n\n   * Nominal Limit: True 1,000,000 (or 2M for Pro 1.5) token window.\n\n   * Effective Reality: Stateless & Raw. If you load a 500-page PDF and ask a question, the entire document remains in the active context window for every single subsequent prompt (unless you manually remove it). It does not summarize unless you tell it to.\n\n   * Consequence: Absolute recall. It is computationally heavier but strictly adheres to data buried in page 500 of your uploaded document.\n\n\n\n2. Output Token Limits: The \"Verbosity\" Cap\n\n\n * Gemini App:\n\n   * Constraint: Often hard-capped around 2,048 to 4,096 output tokens per response (roughly 1,500–3,000 words).\n\n   * Behavior: If you ask for a comprehensive breakdown of a complex argument, the app may prematurely truncate the logic or summarize the ending to \"fit\" the consumer-friendly length constraints.\n\n\n\n * AI Studio:\n\n   * Constraint: Configurable up to 8,192 output tokens (model dependent).\n\n   * Behavior: You can instruct it to write a 6,000-word detailed annex, and provided it doesn't hit the timeout, it will generate the full text without \"lazy\" summarization.\n\n\n\n3. Why the App Feels \"Lazy\" (The RLHF Factor)\n\nYour sources are observing the effects of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).\n\n\n * The App: Tuned for \"safety\" and \"conciseness.\" It is penalized during training for being \"boring\" or \"too long.\" This creates a bias toward surface-level, cheerful summaries rather than rigorous, deep-dive analytics.\n\n \n\n * AI Studio: Provides access to the \"base\" or \"preview\" models which have less of this conversational fine-tuning. They are rawer, follow complex logic instructions better, and do not prioritize \"tone\" over \"substance.\"\n\n\n\n4. Does Your Subscription Matter in AI Studio?\n\nYes.\n\n\nWhile AI Studio has a generous free tier, your Google AI Pro subscription grants you:\n\n * Higher Rate Limits (RPM): You can issue more requests per minute. This is critical if you are iterating rapidly on a prompt for your XYZ article.\n\n * Data Privacy (Enterprise Grade): In the free tier of AI Studio, your inputs can be used to train Google's models. With a paid subscription (specifically when using the API key linked to a paid project), you often gain data exemption status—your proprietary drafts remain yours and do not feed the public model.\n\n\n\nStrategic Recommendation\n\nFor your specific workflow:\n\n\n * Use Gemini App (Here): For quick fact-checking, brainstorming or superficial summaries of news (e.g., \"Summarize the latest XYZ\").\n\n\n * Use AI Studio: For ALL your rigorous professional work (XYZ). ...\"\"",

Problems where you have to make conceptual jumps from one kind of approach to another but definitely not something that requires \"new\" math or that only a few people in the world would understand. It got most of them wrong, in the same answer style that's typical: 30% correct but pretty basic math (maybe something like early grad school), 50% not \"wrong\" but rambling, generic, and not really correct for the problem (\"fluff\"), 19% nonsense, 1% interesting and probably right. There was one problem where it ended up being wrong, but came at the problem from an angle that was surprising. Not \"novel,\" but also not standard. Creative.\n\nI've not seen any dramatic improvement in the math abilities of any of these models since o3 (and the non-deepthink Gemini 3 is, by far, the worst!), with one exception: There was about a week when gpt 5.1 launched that it really was impressive. It followed instructions, felt nuanced, and seemed to genuinely \"understand\" the kind of ideas it was looking for. I don't know what was going on that week, but it was exciting.\n\nOn the strong side, they've all gotten to be really good natural language calculators. If I need something worked out that will take a long time (or where I'd need to ask someone down the hall) it's pretty good. \n\nI wish I could interact with the \"strong\" models we never see. I'm genuinely curious how far they could be pushed and have a desk full of ideas I'd like to work through.",

It's so frustrating. Like, Gemini, I already fucking told you this is about a STATE level issue, why are you giving me all these federal things just because in the previous prompt I mentioned a federal thing? The topic is about state laws. Now you're off running around looking for sources on the federal level.\n\nThen when I point it out, it just appologizes profusely, which is annoying, because then it still fucks up, and it just gets so dilluted with noise trying to get it back on the rails, it just falls apart.",

First gemini said there is a theory a patch from feb6-9th intended to improve effeciency and safety has led to more sterile responses because some of its logic cores aren't triggering from this new patch. Then   a report from google on Feb 12th shows they fully launched  gemini deepthink 3, gemini reported to me that starting that week Google had toned back logic cores and the ticket count got throttled heavily for pro users. So this combined already had made Pro mode go into lazy mode, theres a ton of user reports filed through Gemini as well about the ticket count not unlocking for some users so Google has decided to continue the throttle every 3 hours instead of the 24 hour ticket count until this is fixed. But on top of this all, Gemini detected google is doing a hard shutdown on Gemini 2.5 flash preview today, and this has led to numerous cache and logic core issues. Specifically if you have been using since 2.5 your cache may be corrupting and overall Pro is not using the full 3.0 cores and memory like it should, it keeps reverting to 2.5 reasoning which Gemini then denies and it hallucinates instead of fact checking anything. So this cocktail of problems has led Gemini to being absolute buns the past two weeks and of course Google won't acknowledge any of it and instead silently fix it but having so many problems stacked at once has made Gemini just basically useless other than simple questions the last week for me.",

Still paying the $250 a month.\n\nThese metrics are bullshit. Because. They aren’t reflective of the actual models users get to use. This is to hype the model, but, just like before, it’s gong to degrade. I’ll trust Anthropic for actual science work any day over Deep Think. They tend to degrade their models less. Gemini is just trying to draw in the hype.\n\nSo yes, I’m deeply skeptical of your motives OP. If you’ve engaged significantly in the community in the past, that is one thing, but instead… you created an account for the sole purpose .. of hyping something that’s going to end up being less powerful than Deep Think on 2.5 in its prime.",

                  "text": "Here's an AI generated response as to why the axis is ambiguous \n\nHere are the primary reasons why that \"Score (%)\" is open to interpretation:\n\nMetric Definition: It is unclear if the percentage refers to the number of unique tasks solved (e.g., 85 out of 100 puzzles) or the accuracy per attempt. In ARC-AGI, models are often given multiple attempts at a single puzzle; a \"85%\" score could mean it solved 85% of puzzles on the first try, or that it eventually solved 85% given a certain number of guesses.\n\n\nDataset Subset: The graph doesn't specify which \"test set\" is being used. ARC-AGI-2 has a public evaluation set and a hidden \"private\" set. Performance usually drops significantly on the private set, so without a label, the absolute value of the score is hard to verify.\n\n\nAggregation Method: There is no indication if this is a pass@1 (success on the first guess) or a pass@k (success within k guesses). As the \"Cost per Task\" on the horizontal axis increases, it implies the models are thinking longer or trying more times, which fundamentally changes how that percentage score should be calculated.\n\n\nHuman Baseline: For a benchmark designed to measure human-like intelligence, the axis lacks a \"Human Baseline\" marker (usually around 85-100%). Without that anchor, a 70% score for \"GPT-5.2\" lacks the necessary scale to determine if the model is approaching human reasoning or still far off.",

Description: We are investigating an issue where chat histories are not visible on Gemini Web (gemini.google.com) and the Gemini mobile apps on Wednesday, 2026-02-18 08:30 PST. Our engineering team has identified a background process that was causing the missing user conversation metadata and has successfully stopped the process to prevent further impact. Mitigation efforts are underway, and we do not have an ETA for completion at this time. We will provide an update by Thursday, 2026-02-19 09:00 PST with current details. We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption. Users may find that their sidebar is empty or that previously saved conversations are missing. Impacted web users on [gemini.google.com](http://gemini.google.com) can navigate to Menu (top left) > Settings & Help > Activity. Users may receive an empty response when attempting to list or search for existing conversations. New conversations can still be created and utilized normally. Alternatively, users can navigate to [myactivity.google.com/product/gemini](http://myactivity.google.com/product/gemini) to view their conversation history. Mobile users could navigate to their profile (top right) and select Gemini Apps Activity.|",

What's worse is that it's not the first time there are bugs with Gemini's chat history. Sometimes, when scrolling up a long thread, a massive chunk of the earliest messages is just gone.\n\nGemini is great, but these recurring issues are going to make me switch to a competitor. When you pay for a premium subscription, it's certainly not to end up losing hours and months of chats out of nowhere.",

Firms wanted me to screw people over time and time again, and I had enough. \n\nI say that only because it's second nature at this point (to no credit of my own), and I was shocked that 1) I never really thought of doing it to bypass the stubbornness of any LLMs, and 2) That it worked! \n\n---\n\nFor the record, and for anyone reading, I mean this with the utmost sincerity:\n\n**You matter**, and **you are never alone**. Be the light, even if it's something you have never received. If you don't know where to start, renew your mind and dedicate time to learning. And, while you're at it, dedicate time to your passions, indulge in your creativity, and, I'll tell you from experience, your life will change in an unrecognizable way, for the better... To be clear: Maybe not \"better\" in terms of the world's standards, but I promise you it will be \"better\" in every other single way possible.

No time to learn how vibe coding should be done or to play around with prompts untill it gets fixed and risk breaking other features, etc, hence needs a software engineer. I feel that era will be around for a bit, even as models become more capable.\n\nMy work is not in software engineering, I'm just imagining how the next year or two is going to look out there in the SaaS world. 🤷🏻‍♂️",

Most of the answers I got felt kind of \"AI-ish\" and generic. Everything changed when I stopped just giving it orders and started actually talking to it like a partner.\n\nIf you feel like you’re getting boring results, try this: instead of just saying \"Write me a marketing plan,\" try telling it what you’re working on and then ask it to interview *you*. I started asking it to point out hurdles I might be missing and then told it to ask me five specific questions so it could actually understand my goals.\n\nThe difference is night and day. Once I let it ask me questions first, the advice stopped being generic and started feeling like it was coming from a high-level consultant. It’s way more effective when you let the AI do some of the heavy lifting in the conversation.\n\nIf you're interested in how this shift from command-based prompts to true back-and-forth collaboration is shaping modern tools, this breakdown of conversational AI explains why context-driven dialogue delivers far better outcomes than one-off instructions: [Conversational AI](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/conversational-ai)\n\nHas anyone else noticed that the \"Deep Research\" feature is a game-changer for this, or are you still getting better results with your own prompts?",

After I answer, I'll ask for some other questions, then answer those. Then I'll have it revise my prompt and copy that into Deep Research. Works great!",

I've released maybe 60 songs over 3 years from Suno to Spotify/Youtube etc., in the progressive rock genre, and v5 meets my goals for sound quality and novelty in song structure.  \n  \nGemini's songs are nowhere near as good, although they can generate lyrics based on your prior prompts. They're also limited to 30 seconds, whereas I regularly create 6-8 minute songs in Suno.",
