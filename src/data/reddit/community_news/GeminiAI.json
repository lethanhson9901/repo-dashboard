Also, the app has context slicing, meaning when the context window is used up, it will literally delete the top of your chat thread to make room. They try to balance it with RAG, so it can search your thread and docs, but that usually just means it can only read the beginning and end of documents.",

Or do you think it is actually ignorant about its own limitations and just hallucinates these as well? (Sorry, the text is on the longer side, and slightly redacted for anonymity hence the XYZs):\n\n\n\"\"Your sources are correct. There is a substantial, architecturally enforced divergence between the Gemini Consumer App (this interface) and the raw model access in Google AI Studio. This is a product segmentation strategy.\n\n\nHere is the precise breakdown of the variables you questioned.\n\n\n\n1. Context Window: The \"Memory\" Gap\n\n\n * Gemini App (Consumer):\n\n   * Nominal Limit: Theoretically access to the 1M token window.\n\n   * Effective Reality: The app uses Dynamic Context Management. It does not feed the entire chat history into the model for every turn. To reduce latency and cost, it employs \"RAG\" (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or summarization layers that compress your previous turns.\n\n   * Consequence: In long threads (e.g., drafting a 280-page XYZ guideline), the app will \"forget\" specific constraints you set 20 turns ago because that data was compressed or dropped from the active window to save compute.\n\n\n\n * AI Studio (Developer):\n\n   * Nominal Limit: True 1,000,000 (or 2M for Pro 1.5) token window.\n\n   * Effective Reality: Stateless & Raw. If you load a 500-page PDF and ask a question, the entire document remains in the active context window for every single subsequent prompt (unless you manually remove it). It does not summarize unless you tell it to.\n\n   * Consequence: Absolute recall. It is computationally heavier but strictly adheres to data buried in page 500 of your uploaded document.\n\n\n\n2. Output Token Limits: The \"Verbosity\" Cap\n\n\n * Gemini App:\n\n   * Constraint: Often hard-capped around 2,048 to 4,096 output tokens per response (roughly 1,500–3,000 words).\n\n   * Behavior: If you ask for a comprehensive breakdown of a complex argument, the app may prematurely truncate the logic or summarize the ending to \"fit\" the consumer-friendly length constraints.\n\n\n\n * AI Studio:\n\n   * Constraint: Configurable up to 8,192 output tokens (model dependent).\n\n   * Behavior: You can instruct it to write a 6,000-word detailed annex, and provided it doesn't hit the timeout, it will generate the full text without \"lazy\" summarization.\n\n\n\n3. Why the App Feels \"Lazy\" (The RLHF Factor)\n\nYour sources are observing the effects of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).\n\n\n * The App: Tuned for \"safety\" and \"conciseness.\" It is penalized during training for being \"boring\" or \"too long.\" This creates a bias toward surface-level, cheerful summaries rather than rigorous, deep-dive analytics.\n\n \n\n * AI Studio: Provides access to the \"base\" or \"preview\" models which have less of this conversational fine-tuning. They are rawer, follow complex logic instructions better, and do not prioritize \"tone\" over \"substance.\"\n\n\n\n4. Does Your Subscription Matter in AI Studio?\n\nYes.\n\n\nWhile AI Studio has a generous free tier, your Google AI Pro subscription grants you:\n\n * Higher Rate Limits (RPM): You can issue more requests per minute. This is critical if you are iterating rapidly on a prompt for your XYZ article.\n\n * Data Privacy (Enterprise Grade): In the free tier of AI Studio, your inputs can be used to train Google's models. With a paid subscription (specifically when using the API key linked to a paid project), you often gain data exemption status—your proprietary drafts remain yours and do not feed the public model.\n\n\n\nStrategic Recommendation\n\nFor your specific workflow:\n\n\n * Use Gemini App (Here): For quick fact-checking, brainstorming or superficial summaries of news (e.g., \"Summarize the latest XYZ\").\n\n\n * Use AI Studio: For ALL your rigorous professional work (XYZ). ...\"\"",

It's so frustrating. Like, Gemini, I already fucking told you this is about a STATE level issue, why are you giving me all these federal things just because in the previous prompt I mentioned a federal thing? The topic is about state laws. Now you're off running around looking for sources on the federal level.\n\nThen when I point it out, it just appologizes profusely, which is annoying, because then it still fucks up, and it just gets so dilluted with noise trying to get it back on the rails, it just falls apart.",

          "text": "I want to make a post because ive been askingg Gemini the past week to track why its degradation on logic is so bad, all of my chat windows turn into hallucinations within an hour. First gemini said there is a theory a patch from feb6-9th intended to improve effeciency and safety has led to more sterile responses because some of its logic cores aren't triggering from this new patch. Then   a report from google on Feb 12th shows they fully launched  gemini deepthink 3, gemini reported to me that starting that week Google had toned back logic cores and the ticket count got throttled heavily for pro users. So this combined already had made Pro mode go into lazy mode, theres a ton of user reports filed through Gemini as well about the ticket count not unlocking for some users so Google has decided to continue the throttle every 3 hours instead of the 24 hour ticket count until this is fixed. But on top of this all, Gemini detected google is doing a hard shutdown on Gemini 2.5 flash preview today, and this has led to numerous cache and logic core issues. Specifically if you have been using since 2.5 your cache may be corrupting and overall Pro is not using the full 3.0 cores and memory like it should, it keeps reverting to 2.5 reasoning which Gemini then denies and it hallucinates instead of fact checking anything. So this cocktail of problems has led Gemini to being absolute buns the past two weeks and of course Google won't acknowledge any of it and instead silently fix it but having so many problems stacked at once has made Gemini just basically useless other than simple questions the last week for me.",

Description: We are investigating an issue where chat histories are not visible on Gemini Web (gemini.google.com) and the Gemini mobile apps on Wednesday, 2026-02-18 08:30 PST. Our engineering team has identified a background process that was causing the missing user conversation metadata and has successfully stopped the process to prevent further impact. Mitigation efforts are underway, and we do not have an ETA for completion at this time. We will provide an update by Thursday, 2026-02-19 09:00 PST with current details. We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption. Users may find that their sidebar is empty or that previously saved conversations are missing. Impacted web users on [gemini.google.com](http://gemini.google.com) can navigate to Menu (top left) > Settings & Help > Activity. Users may receive an empty response when attempting to list or search for existing conversations. New conversations can still be created and utilized normally. Alternatively, users can navigate to [myactivity.google.com/product/gemini](http://myactivity.google.com/product/gemini) to view their conversation history. Mobile users could navigate to their profile (top right) and select Gemini Apps Activity.|",

Basically we just haven’t been getting what we pay for over the last few months. \n\nAnd saying “go use AI studio” isn’t a solution because if you work in a company with any sort of data privacy SOPs, you aren’t allowed to dump your projects into the public AI Studio page. For a while it was even blocked at my firm. It’s considered far worse than using our enterprise option that uses Google models via Vertex. \n\nApparently Vertex also works fine and doesn’t truncate. But my group doesn’t use its interface so we are stuck until Google fixes the tokens on Gemini",

We were told none of our negotiated privacy terms apply if we use AI Studio.\n\nEven if your company has an account with negotiated privacy terms, the problem is that it’s so easy to accidently sign out, or sign into your personal account if you check your Gmail (which employees were doing constantly, hence why our IT blocked the AI studio site). \n\nBut if you’re careful and your legal team said it’s fine, or you’re in a field that doesn’t deal with financial or medical data, it’s probably less of an issue.\n\nAlso it’s not that Google will necessarily claim your data or say they own it, but if you’re in a regulated industry it’s considered a data breach if certain data accidently got put into AI Studio.",

Firms wanted me to screw people over time and time again, and I had enough. \n\nI say that only because it's second nature at this point (to no credit of my own), and I was shocked that 1) I never really thought of doing it to bypass the stubbornness of any LLMs, and 2) That it worked! \n\n---\n\nFor the record, and for anyone reading, I mean this with the utmost sincerity:\n\n**You matter**, and **you are never alone**. Be the light, even if it's something you have never received. If you don't know where to start, renew your mind and dedicate time to learning. And, while you're at it, dedicate time to your passions, indulge in your creativity, and, I'll tell you from experience, your life will change in an unrecognizable way, for the better... To be clear: Maybe not \"better\" in terms of the world's standards, but I promise you it will be \"better\" in every other single way possible.
