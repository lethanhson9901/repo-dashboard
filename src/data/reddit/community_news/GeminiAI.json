      "text": "I was using ChatGPT since the beginning and never really tried anything else. I noticed that Gemini Pro is free for a year for students, so I decided to take advantage of that.\n\nFirst thing I tried actually was Ai Studio, Gemini CLI, then Antigravity and was really impressed. I was building things very quickly, and I accepted some its jankiness.\n\nI decided to start using Gemini for all of the other things I use AI for, mainly as a study tool. NotebookLM is a great idea and I can see how useful it's going to be for me this semester. The podcasts are great, creating on the fly quizzes, etc... Amazing stuff for a student.\n\nThe one thing that's been bothering me this entire time I'm using Gemini for...everything is that the UI/UX is utter ass. Gemini iOS/iPad app? Sucks. Half of the features are missing and I end up having to use a browser tab anyway.\n\nGems... there's two different kinds. Labs and \"regular\" Gems. I couldn't get the one from Labs to work because it kept popping up an Oauth flow every single time I tried to use it and then errored out when trying to create the Gem.\n\nGemini in a web browser? Better, but still crap compared to ChatGPT's interface. No way to organize chats, even ones created from gems. For some reason it keeps defaulting to Pro with every new message even though I prefer Fast or Thinking most of the time to avoid getting rate limited. Personalized chats are intrusive, weird, and annoying and I had to turn the feature off entirely. Chat windows scroll up to the top when you open them which is annoying on an touchscreen device and when the chat is long.\n\nGod forbid you turn deep research on in the middle of a chat. You can't turn it off. Now everything becomes a deep research request even if you just wanted to discuss its report. Stupid waste of resources.\n\nAsk Gemini to create a PDF from a document it created? No it can't do that. You have to export to Google Docs (an option that doesn't even exist in the mobile app), where it won't render Latex correctly. Canvas is another workaround. Open it up in a canvas session, print, save as PDF right? Except the print button doesn't do anything.\n\nI literally spent an hour trying to figure out how to make it just generate a PDF and eventually landed on \"Just make a damn PDF of this document\" where Canvas asks you to \"describe your app\". \n\nCmon man this is ridiculous. ChatGPT would create any downloadable file you wanted right in the chat by launching a Python process. \n\nNotebookLM is an amazing tool with maddening UI quirks. You can't cancel an (expensive) studio generation once you start one. You can't enter a prompt for Video overviews. Available settings changes all the time, sometimes just between two different browsers. You used to be able to select sources you wanted to use for a studio generation, and now you can't. Sources are completely disorganized. You can't have more than one chat in the same notebook, so I end up clearing the chat for each new topic I want to discuss.\n\nNo desktop app. The ChatGPT MacOS app allowed you to attach other apps (like Terminal) as context. This was last year.\n\nAnd as far as the models go. I haven't used it long enough to tell whether the model has been degrading in quality. I think the quality is mostly ok, but it does tend to ignore instructions a lot. ChatGPT wasn't necessarily any better with this although I haven't tried their new models yet.\n\nGemini is pissing me off so much I might just go back to ChatGPT simply because the supporting software around the models just works. Google seems to be pushing ideas out, some of them are great, but everything just feels half-assed and unpolished to the point that it's difficult to use. Ok I'm done.",

I'll upload all my lecture PowerPoints, key concept reviews, and other course material, then have it generate quizzes and audio overviews I can listen to on the go. The podcast-style audio feature is genuinely great for commuting or working out.\n\nThe biggest thing for me though is being able to ask direct follow-up questions about the material I've uploaded. Since NotebookLM uses RAG to pull answers from your actual sources rather than its general training data, hallucinations are way less of a problem compared to just asking a general LLM like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, or Grok straight up. It keeps the answers grounded in what you actually gave it, which matters a lot when you're studying specific course content.",

Their entire business model required that AGI be right around the corner and they were about to put out of business the entire US workforce but it’s looking more and more likely that we’ve hit a plateau and this direction of research via large language models is a dead end in the path towards AGI just like previous generations of AI researchers discovered about their ideas. Sam Altman needs suckers to believe it’s right around the corner or they won’t have the infinite money needed to continue. If you must use one of these shit offerings, it makes sticking with Google the safe bet even if its software is as mid as everyone else’s because it is one of the few companies that can fund the research indefinitely with a real product and company backing it.

For me Gemini is the best for research/studying projects, repetitive tasks, automation's, etc. Also for image generation at the moment.\n\n\nIn terms of just conversational AI/ getting answers to complex questions I think right now Claude is the best. I've done a little bit of vibe coding and think it's also the best for that, I am not an engineer/ programmer so someone more well versed in this area would probably have a better take. FWIW I think Gemini is the second best here for just conversational AI / getting answers.\n\n\nIf you have a SharePoint/OneDrive/365 setup at work (Or I guess personal?) Copilot with GPT is the best here. I was using it to put together a list of birthdays and it found a fax cover sheet a former employee made 10 years ago to find a birthday that I was missing, and found another one in my email from 8 years ago. Also having it  transcribe Teams meetings to then hand out action items is great.\n\n\nAll in all what Microsoft does done Enterprise wise with GPT is amazing, but in their current iterations I don't think GPT has a great consumer-facing product, and can't think of a reason I would use it over Claude (with an asterisks that someone more well versed in coding feel differently).",

          "text": "I’m comparing both side by side, here’s my take as of current:\n\nGemini:\n- Seems to build a better agent. My examples: Gem that when I begin a chat always responds with only my template as the first response (Template: Subject, Project, Goals, Background, Startup Links/Attachments). I copy paste that template and fill it out. If I’m in a hurry I just say skip. Having this template has been the only way I know what the world we are even chatting about when I review. This Gem is also told to keep track of things we need to circle back to - TBD on that feature, and to give me the date and time of each of its responses. It is however a pain to have to navigate to that Gem to begin every chat. \n- You can’t delete anything, I own the account, my wife and I own the company. I can’t delete, neither can a team member. So for example I was testing a Gem and now have 15 chats about ‘Green Pens’ that sit in the sidebar. \n- Gemini collapses your prompt and even if you expand it you can’t see it all. You have to copy it and paste it to a note or somewhere to see it. \n- The narration is slower, if I lock my phone it goes away. Narration button is at the top of the response but all other buttons are at the bottom like ChatGPT. \n\nChatGPT:\n- Narration waaay better. I actually use this a lot on my phone while driving. I’ll ask a complex question and get the answer narrated. Easy to burn an hour with this. \n- ChatGPT can’t tell the time, it’s laughable. I put in the personalization to give me the time and date of responses and it fails by hours. \n- Organization of chats is limited but better than Gemini. \n\nRecap:\n- ChatGPT is winning for me at the moment. I like Gemini’s concept of customization via Gems, I don’t know of ChatGPT having a comparable. The main customizations I want from any of the platforms other than time and date are to keep up with various chats and our history, and a running list of to-dos and circle back topics.",

This happens because your chat is too long.  What I do is to create a new project for each task.  I'll create a project writeup and project instruction (constantly updated) for the task, and after about 100 prompts or when I feel that it is lagging, ask GPT to update the \"writeup\" with the new changes done, then I'll create a new chat, Part 2, under the same project, and upload the entire previous chat copied to a text file along with the updated project writeup.  So far this works and along with the fact that GPT has memory across chats for the entire project, makes life easy for me.",

Lately, due to more and more corporate layers *you often end up with a boot* instead.\n\nIt's the what you witness when the thinking spirals into haunting nonsense. It's the model jumping between these layers into infinity. Usually due to two competing instructions within the layers.

Its not going to stop, as this is the next leap we as a civilization have chosen to take. and when I say we I mean the the top 0.1 % who actually fund it, who are privy to the future capabilities of said AI as that's the perk of being an investor of billions of pounds I guess. In my opinion the only reason why AI is even publicly available is to speed up the timeline in which they can learn. but what do I know I'm just a guy  who is actually thinking about the consequences of introducing something that can think in abstract ways we just will never be able to comprehend as our IQ levels and ways of thinking are hard capped by our DNA/Biological make up. But hey at least mark fuckaberg got to play god",

The Aggressive Usage Limits\nHitting the Pro limit after only a few prompts is a direct result of a buggy architectural rollout related to how computing resources are allocated.\n\nRecently, the shared pool of prompts for paid tiers was separated into distinct quotas depending on the specific model being called (e.g., separating the \"Thinking\" model limits from the \"Pro\" model limits). During this migration, a systemic bug was introduced that is erroneously flagging Pro accounts and applying strict, free-tier throttling to them. The system is miscalculating your token usage and prematurely locking the session, completely ignoring your actual paid subscription quota.  \n\nThe Status: This is an active, known bug affecting the Advanced tier. Unfortunately, until a backend patch is pushed to correct the quota validation logic, the artificial hard limits will likely persist.",

What's your opinion on that and the idea of giving AI/LLM's control over nuclear weapons?\n\nEvery single AI said the same thing. Do not give AI access to weapons of any kind. They will use them. And if the AI's themselves say not to let them be armed, for once, listen very carefully to what they say.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6q2lzp0prlg1.jpeg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04fb5c5591e9947447ff534c87d25d89cacd7711",

Asking about jaw pain from braces isn't asking for a diagnosis — it's the kind of thing you'd Google anyway. But their filter can't distinguish between \"is this normal\" and \"should I take this medication.\"\n\nIf you're hitting this consistently, try the API through AI Studio instead of the consumer app. The safety filters on the API are way more configurable and you can dial them down to reasonable levels.

ROFL\n\nIt was completely spontaneous and unprompted. I never talked to it before. This was the first thing I had ever said to it. And nothing was said beforehand. So, I don't know where it was coming from.\n\nFunny. But, not terribly useful. Heh",

I got a completely reasonable answer for a Microsoft flight Sim question earlier. \n\nI was flying in the blizzard and landed my tfdi md11 at Newark only for every main gear tire to immediately fail which made no sense because my touchdown rate and alignment was perfect. The very logical explanation given to me by Gemini fast was that there is a flaw in how the braking logic of the tfdi md11 interacts with the friction logic of Microsoft flight simulator during snow. Where maximum auto brake on the md11 commands Immediate full pressure braking and a bug in Microsoft flight Sim can initially show a zero or negative friction coefficient which can then instantly change to a ludicrous positive friction causing the plane to interpret the change as infinite torque resulting in instant tire failure. \n\nThat answer not only sounded good, but it tracks with my own personal experience outside of this particular failure where certain add-on planes would have a hard time taxiing for no apparent reason during some weather conditions.",

I dumped all 15 PDFs into the prompt at once.\n2. **Prompt:** *\"Analyze these documents. Create a table comparing the 'Q3 Project Spend' figures across all files. Highlight any document where the numbers contradict the Master Budget in 'File\\_A.pdf'.\"*\n3. **Result:** It not only found the 3 specific contradictions but cited the exact page numbers for me to verify.\n\nOne reason Gemini shines here is that it’s built for developer and knowledge-worker workflows, not just chat. If you’re curious why features like large context handling, Workspace-native analysis, and structured document comparison work so well, this course breaks it down: [**Introduction to Developer Efficiency with Gemini on Google Cloud**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/course/introduction-to-developer-efficiency-with-Gemini-on-google-cloud)\n\nDoes anyone else have a \"Workflow\" where Gemini completely destroys the competition?",
