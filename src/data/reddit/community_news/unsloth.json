Translate Gemma has a specialized chat template that requires you to specify the language you want to translate to - this means it's not a chat model - you will need to specify the chat template kwargs separately, so it can't be loaded well in frontend UIs and make the process just harder for folks\n2. The chat template fixes are wide ranging, and we also do direct model implementation fixes - see the following:\n    * Gemma 1, Gemma 3 bug fixes: https://x.com/karpathy/status/1765473722985771335\n    * Phi 4 fixes: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/11/phi-4-bug-fixes/\n    * Llama 4 fixes: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxo7lb/llamacpp_got_2_fixes_for_llama_4_rope_wrong_norms/\n    * GPT OSS fixes: https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1953901104150065544\n    * Kimi K2 bug fixes: https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1946163064665260486\n    * And many more - we do a lot of our work behind the scenes now, so whatever model that was released with us generally is already fixed.\n3.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm currently running GRPO training and hitting a snag when trying to determine the maximum VRAM requirement. The training itself runs smoothly, initially using around 25GB of VRAM. However, after approximately 140 steps, the VRAM usage spikes and exceeds my GPU's 48GB capacity.\n\nI've already sorted my dataset by length, ensuring the longest inputs are processed first.  \nMy suspicion is that at step 140 all generations utilize the maximum context size of 5120. This results in a significantly larger average context size in this step compared to others.\n\nIs there a way to force the trainer to utilize the full context size or ignore the EOS token, so I can test if the peak VRAM usage is too high right from the first step? I’m looking for a method to proactively identify this issue before it crashes the training process.\n\nAny insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

VRAM usage during Initial training was 75gb then as it was beginning to do the first eval (I suppose, the tqdm progress bar lags behind the actual progress) VRAM usage spiked and I got an OOM error.\n\nDuring a normal eval run I’ll typically see VRAM usage drop in the beginning and then go back up. I assume it’s unloading gradients then loads the batches.\n\n—-\n\nThis was my first attempt with this model and GPU setup and I don’t have anything dialed in yet but I have had similar experiences training 0.6B to 22B models on the a5000.

That along with a batch size of 64 is perhaps flying close to the sun.

I was hoping I could identify the expert layers that are underutilized and target those expert layers. But if the router layers are untouched this would essentially remain the same and I would need to fine tune the router layers to take advantage of fine-tuned expert layers. Could I first fine tune the expert layers, and the do a second pass and fine-tune the router layers?\n\nI have had success doing something similar to a 7B model with [arcee-ai/PruneMe](https://github.com/arcee-ai/PruneMe) to compute block similarity to identify redundant layers and instead of pruning them I used Axolotl to freeze all other layers and target those redundant layers.\n\nIs my understanding correct that, unless the router is also fine-tuned, any changes I make to the experts won’t materially affect which experts get selected (and therefore won’t change expert utilization in practice)?",

As you mentioned, you can do a multi-stage fine-tuning by fine-tuning only the export layers and then the router layers. I really wouldn't suggest that because whatever learning we are intending the model to happen, it should happen ideally.\n2. You can just enable fine-tuning on the router layers along with the fine-tuning of expert layers and train them in the single training run. That should be more coherent. \n\nAgain, if you know what you are doing, we don't stop you from fine-tuning the router layers if you want to. But it might hurt training and downstream performance so we generally recommend against doing that.\n\nTo clarify or correct your understanding that router utilization wouldn't change if we don't find you in the router, I think there are ways where even if you freeze the router but only train the experts, the expert utilisation/token distribution would change. This is because changing one layer's output would mean that the inputs to the second layer already change, and that can potentially end up causing the token to pick different experts over the course of the training.",

But, I'd like to use the `train_on_responses_only` - maybe it might give better results? But how can i do that with my alpaca format data?",
