More than this number of tokens context anyway takes too long to process and my integrations timeout.\n\nSo far this works very well with OpenClaw for coding tasks and tool calling. It does get a little bogged down when using a browser with Playwright. It seems to be very good at Kubernetes as well so it could be useful as a DevOps agent.\n\nThanks Unsloth for making this possible!",

          "text": "I'm not exactly following what you're asking, so just to make sure we're on the same page, Unsloth is a python library for working with / training transformers models - the primary format you find on Huggingface. It's not like an app you load the model in. You write python code and inside the code you call unsloth/transformers/trl to load the model and then you can do whatever you want to it with your code. A GGUF is a custom format used by llama.cpp - and llama.cpp comes with the python script to convert a transformers model to a GGUF and another script to Quantize it. An \"Unsloth model\" is just a normal model that the unsloth team tuned up, but it's still in the standard transformers format and then optionally converted into a handful of other proprietary formats like GGUF. So my question is, are you asking for models that you can load using the unsloth library in python, or models that have been tweaked by the unsloth team?",

      "text": "\n\nHi Folks,\n\nI am currently building a composite agentic system for my PhD dissertation (a Design-Based Research project). The system is a \"Purposeful Agent\" designed to act as a professional executive coach. It uses a multi-agent RAG architecture with a vLLM backend routing to multiple specialized LoRA adapters (e.g., an `adapter_empathy`, `adapter_scaffolding`, `adapter_planner`) based on the user's real-time emotional state (Valence-Arousal-Dominance).\n\nBecause my research relies on highly authentic, expert-validated facilitation transcripts, my dataset is incredibly constrained. Based on the *LIMA (Less Is More for Alignment)* hypothesis, I am attempting to do purely behavioral/stylistic fine-tuning using extremely small, highly curated datasets—specifically **only 50 to 100 rows of data per adapter**.\n\nMy goal is not to teach the model new knowledge, but to teach it a very specific facilitative stance (e.g., asking open-ended questions, mirroring, and strictly avoiding giving direct advice).\n\nGiven the high risk of catastrophic overfitting with such a small dataset, I have developed the following training strategy using Unsloth. I would love your expert feedback on whether this is viable and if there are any Unsloth-specific optimizations I should apply:\n\n**1. Data Structure: Multi-Turn ChatML Threads** Instead of single-turn Q&A pairs, I am formatting my 50-100 rows as multi-turn conversational histories (User -> Assistant -> User -> Assistant) using standard ChatML. The theory is that this will provide enough linguistic density for the attention mechanism to learn the temporal pacing of a coaching intervention (e.g., when to validate vs. when to probe) rather than just acting like a reactive search engine.\n\n**2. Data Composition: \"Hard Negatives\" to counter RLHF** Base instruction models (like Llama-3-8B-Instruct) are heavily biased toward sycophancy and immediate problem-solving due to their RLHF training. To overwrite this urge to give \"helpful advice,\" roughly 20% of my micro-dataset consists of \"hard negative\" interactions, where the user explicitly begs for advice, and the assistant actively deflects and returns agency to the user.\n\n**3. Hyperparameter Adjustments for Micro-Datasets** To prevent the loss curve from instantly crashing to zero and the model simply memorizing the 50 transcripts, I am planning the following hyperparameter constraints:\n\n* **LoRA Rank (r) & Alpha:** Very low rank (r=4 or 8) with Alpha=16 to restrict the adapter's capacity and force generalization over memorization.\n* **Dropout:** Increasing LoRA dropout to `0.05` or `0.10`.\n* **Learning Rate:** Lowering to `2e-5` for a gentler update to the stylistic weights.\n* **Epochs:** Capping at 3 to 4 epochs, utilizing a small holdout set to closely monitor Validation Loss. If validation loss spikes while training loss drops, I will trigger early stopping.\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Given Unsloth's underlying optimizations, is this micro-dataset strategy (50-100 multi-turn rows) mathematically viable for behavioral cloning, or is that simply too little data for the optimizer to find a meaningful gradient?\n2. Are there any specific Unsloth arguments, parameters, or configurations (e.g., specific target modules, gradient accumulation steps, or learning rate schedulers) you would highly recommend when the dataset is this tiny?\n3. Have you seen success with multi-turn ChatML formatting in Unsloth when trying to teach conversational pacing rather than just instruction following?\n\nThank you so much for your time and for building such an incredible tool for the open-source community!",
