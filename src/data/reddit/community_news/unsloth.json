If I didn’t have specific needs for my self-hosted apps, I’d probably use that exclusively for chatting. It’s definitely smarter than Qwen3 30B A3B in my usage.\n\nFor my workhorse applications I went back to Qwen3 30B A3B. Reluctantly. It’s just faster and better on VRAM, and “good enough”.",

It can create and edit files and interact with the terminal, but it consistently outputs broken code and introduces errors when editing files.\n\nIn contrast, Qwen, even in version Q4, is capable of providing a fully functional implementation of Flappy Bird from start to finish. based on the tests I ran, the GGUF versions still need further refinement. I tested the model using the version available on OpenRouter, where it performs significantly better than in my GGUF-based tests.

Translate Gemma has a specialized chat template that requires you to specify the language you want to translate to - this means it's not a chat model - you will need to specify the chat template kwargs separately, so it can't be loaded well in frontend UIs and make the process just harder for folks\n2. The chat template fixes are wide ranging, and we also do direct model implementation fixes - see the following:\n    * Gemma 1, Gemma 3 bug fixes: https://x.com/karpathy/status/1765473722985771335\n    * Phi 4 fixes: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/11/phi-4-bug-fixes/\n    * Llama 4 fixes: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxo7lb/llamacpp_got_2_fixes_for_llama_4_rope_wrong_norms/\n    * GPT OSS fixes: https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1953901104150065544\n    * Kimi K2 bug fixes: https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1946163064665260486\n    * And many more - we do a lot of our work behind the scenes now, so whatever model that was released with us generally is already fixed.\n3. The copyright header is Apache 2 (fully open source) - we place it because folks would simply copy and paste and rebrand it as their own fixes - we just want attribution that's all. Likewise all fixes before a model releases is licensed as whatever the model provider wants.",

Can improve tool-calling in some cases.|\n\nImportant: If `dry-multiplier` isn’t available (e.g. LM Studio), **disable repeat penalty** instead.\n\nRecommended parameters:\n\n    --temp 0.2 --top-k 50 --top-p 0.95 --min-p 0.01 --dry-multiplier 1.1\n\nIf the above parameters do not work, you can also try Z.ai's recommended parameters:\n\n* For general use-case: `--temp 1.0 --top-p 0.95`\n* For tool-calling: `--temp 0.7 --top-p 1.0`\n\nIf you still experience looping issues even after following all these steps, please let us know!",

I’d suspect the 1B model barely has the degree of multilingual training you need to make the connections you desire.\n\nI’m not sure what dialect you are using but try a CPT epoch making sure it learns the associations and then your SFT and see if it improves.",
