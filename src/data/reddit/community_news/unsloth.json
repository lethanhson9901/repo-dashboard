My question is more about where the Unsloth models UD-Q3\\_K\\_XL, UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL, and MXFP4\\_MOE would be located on this graph.  \nWould they be positioned on the line between UD-IQ3\\_XXS and UD-Q6\\_K\\_XL?  \nI'm currently using MXFP4, which gives me 20 tokens per second (for video transcription and small code edits), and UD-Q8\\_K\\_XL (for agent-based encoding), which gives me 15 tokens per second.  \nLooking at this graph, I thought that UD-IQ3\\_XXS would be very good and faster than MXFP4, while also being almost as accurate as UD-Q6\\_K\\_XL, but its speed is similar to UD-Q8\\_K\\_XL.  \nIs UD-IQ3\\_XXS more accurate than MXFP4?  \nIs MXFP4 particularly fast compared to other quantization methods?  \nIs UD-IQ3\\_XXS quantization slower?  \nWhich quantization method would be best for me, offering a good balance between speed and accuracy for both casual use and more demanding tasks?",

How do those affects compare to temperature changes? Xcreate shows that these models do indeed have different output but it seems to be that they lose nuance as they compress more which makes perfect sense given the way compression works. I would love to see more standardized testing around this stuff. Model providers wont even compare the same benchmarks at full size let alone quants...",

I’m only seeing around 7t/s with my 3090 and 32 core Xeon on 356gb of ddr4 RAM so I’m trying to understand what I might be configuring wrong.  (Or is it just because I’m not ddr5 and more recent cpu?) I also have two 5060ti I can use - but adding those in, I don’t see any real performance increase.  I’m using a current llama.cpp built just yesterday.  Thanks for any help.

Increasing to 56 layers offloaded to the CPU brought VRAM usage down to <24 GB, and dropped inference speeds back down to about 33.  So 25 is definitely possible with only 24 GB of VRAM, but you need a CPU with high memory bandwidth to do it.",

      "text": "\n\nHi Folks,\n\nI am currently building a composite agentic system for my PhD dissertation (a Design-Based Research project). The system is a \"Purposeful Agent\" designed to act as a professional executive coach. It uses a multi-agent RAG architecture with a vLLM backend routing to multiple specialized LoRA adapters (e.g., an `adapter_empathy`, `adapter_scaffolding`, `adapter_planner`) based on the user's real-time emotional state (Valence-Arousal-Dominance).\n\nBecause my research relies on highly authentic, expert-validated facilitation transcripts, my dataset is incredibly constrained. Based on the *LIMA (Less Is More for Alignment)* hypothesis, I am attempting to do purely behavioral/stylistic fine-tuning using extremely small, highly curated datasets—specifically **only 50 to 100 rows of data per adapter**.\n\nMy goal is not to teach the model new knowledge, but to teach it a very specific facilitative stance (e.g., asking open-ended questions, mirroring, and strictly avoiding giving direct advice).\n\nGiven the high risk of catastrophic overfitting with such a small dataset, I have developed the following training strategy using Unsloth. I would love your expert feedback on whether this is viable and if there are any Unsloth-specific optimizations I should apply:\n\n**1. Data Structure: Multi-Turn ChatML Threads** Instead of single-turn Q&A pairs, I am formatting my 50-100 rows as multi-turn conversational histories (User -> Assistant -> User -> Assistant) using standard ChatML. The theory is that this will provide enough linguistic density for the attention mechanism to learn the temporal pacing of a coaching intervention (e.g., when to validate vs. when to probe) rather than just acting like a reactive search engine.\n\n**2. Data Composition: \"Hard Negatives\" to counter RLHF** Base instruction models (like Llama-3-8B-Instruct) are heavily biased toward sycophancy and immediate problem-solving due to their RLHF training. To overwrite this urge to give \"helpful advice,\" roughly 20% of my micro-dataset consists of \"hard negative\" interactions, where the user explicitly begs for advice, and the assistant actively deflects and returns agency to the user.\n\n**3. Hyperparameter Adjustments for Micro-Datasets** To prevent the loss curve from instantly crashing to zero and the model simply memorizing the 50 transcripts, I am planning the following hyperparameter constraints:\n\n* **LoRA Rank (r) & Alpha:** Very low rank (r=4 or 8) with Alpha=16 to restrict the adapter's capacity and force generalization over memorization.\n* **Dropout:** Increasing LoRA dropout to `0.05` or `0.10`.\n* **Learning Rate:** Lowering to `2e-5` for a gentler update to the stylistic weights.\n* **Epochs:** Capping at 3 to 4 epochs, utilizing a small holdout set to closely monitor Validation Loss. If validation loss spikes while training loss drops, I will trigger early stopping.\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Given Unsloth's underlying optimizations, is this micro-dataset strategy (50-100 multi-turn rows) mathematically viable for behavioral cloning, or is that simply too little data for the optimizer to find a meaningful gradient?\n2. Are there any specific Unsloth arguments, parameters, or configurations (e.g., specific target modules, gradient accumulation steps, or learning rate schedulers) you would highly recommend when the dataset is this tiny?\n3. Have you seen success with multi-turn ChatML formatting in Unsloth when trying to teach conversational pacing rather than just instruction following?\n\nThank you so much for your time and for building such an incredible tool for the open-source community!",

          "text": "Great setup — a few concrete answers to your three questions:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*1. Is 50-100 multi-turn rows viable?\\*\\*\n\nYes, for behavioral/stylistic cloning specifically. LIMA showed 1000 rows generalises, but you're not teaching knowledge — you're overwriting an attentional pattern (\"deflect advice, return agency\"). At r=4 with multi-turn ChatML you're probably updating \\~0.1% of weights. The optimizer has enough signal from 50 well-formed coaching transcripts if the examples are consistent in style. The risk isn't gradient direction, it's gradient \\*magnitude\\* — with tiny batches you'll see noisy norm spikes that look alarming but aren't.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*2. Unsloth-specific recommendations:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Use \\`gradient\\_accumulation\\_steps=4-8\\` to smooth out the noisy per-step gradients you'll get from batch\\_size=1-2\n\n\\- \\`warmup\\_ratio=0.1\\` (longer warmup than usual) — the model needs more steps before it \"commits\" to the style shift\n\n\\- \\`weight\\_decay=0.01\\` helps prevent the few-shot memorisation collapse\n\n\\- For target modules, \\`q\\_proj, v\\_proj\\` only (skip k/o/gate) — minimum footprint for behavioural style\n\n\n\n\\*\\*3. On your early stopping trigger:\\*\\*\n\nValidation loss \\*spikes\\* on micro-datasets are often gradient norm events rather than true divergence — the spike resolves within 2-3 steps. Before triggering early stopping, check if the spike recovers. A tool like ZClip (adaptive gradient clipping based on rolling norm history) handles this better than fixed \\`max\\_grad\\_norm\\` — it only clips when the norm is statistically anomalous vs. your run history rather than at a fixed ceiling.\n\n\n\nI ran a similar ablation on TinyLlama (200 rows, same seed) comparing plain LoRA vs LoRA + adaptive clipping — peak grad norm dropped 52.7% with neutral impact on final loss. For a 50-row micro-dataset the effect would likely be more pronounced. Happy to share details if useful.",

      "text": "So am working on my thesis project which involves fine-tuning a small language model for a specific code generation task in a niche domain (Typescript)\n\nI'm leaning toward the Qwen family of models. I started by fine-tuning the 8B version, but it didn't feel like a true SLM in terms of consumer-hardware-efficiency and size, so I'm downgrading to the 4B variant for better adherence to SLM part.\n\nMy main concern is my dataset: It's high-quality but small, with only 700-800 `{prompt,completion}` pairs. Some pairs are distilled from larger LLMs, while others come from real code snippets paired with synthetically generated prompts. The data is straightforward (no chain-of-thought reasoning) but it includes potential noise: like non-code elements in code files (placeholders, plain text, or image paths). I want to train the model effectively so it performs well on my use case without picking up this noise or overfitting to the limited examples\n\nFor context I'm currently training on Google Colab with an A100 GPU. Here's the configuration I'm using, based on recommendations from Reddit threads and Unsloth docs:\n\n    model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n        model,\n        r=64,\n        lora_alpha=128,\n        lora_dropout=0.05,\n        target_modules=[\n            \"q_proj\", \"k_proj\", \"v_proj\", \"o_proj\",  # Self-attention\n            \"gate_proj\",  # MLP gate for code generation patterns\n        ],\n        bias=\"none\",  \n        use_gradient_checkpointing=\"unsloth\", \n        random_state=3407,\n        use_rslora=False,\n        loftq_config=None,\n    )\n    \n    training_args = SFTConfig(\n        output_dir=\"./qwen-8b-a100\",\n        per_device_train_batch_size=16, \n        gradient_accumulation_steps=2,  \n        per_device_eval_batch_size=16,  \n    \n        num_train_epochs=3,\n        max_steps=-1,  # Use epochs (not max_steps)\n        learning_rate=2e-4,\n        lr_scheduler_type=\"cosine\",\n        warmup_ratio=0.05,  # 5% warmup\n        optim=\"adamw_8bit\",  # Memory efficient, works well with LoRA\n        weight_decay=0.01,   # Light regularization\n        fp16=False,  # Don't use FP16 on A100\n        bf16=True,  # A100 has native BF16 support - MUCH better!\n        tf32=True,  # Enable TensorFloat-32 for even faster matmuls\n        dataloader_num_workers=4,  # Parallel data loading\n        dataloader_pin_memory=True,  # Faster GPU transfers\n        logging_steps=5,\n        eval_strategy=\"steps\",\n        eval_steps=10,\n        save_strategy=\"steps\",\n        save_steps=10,  # Match eval_steps\n        save_total_limit=3,  # Keep 3 best\n        load_best_model_at_end=True,\n        metric_for_best_model=\"eval_loss\",\n        greater_is_better=False,\n        packing=True,\n        max_seq_length=4096,\n        seed=3407,\n        report_to=\"none\",\n        dataset_text_field=\"text\",\n    )\n    \n    trainer = SFTTrainer(\n        model=model,\n        args=training_args,\n        processing_class=tokenizer,\n        train_dataset=train_dataset_formatted,\n        eval_dataset=val_dataset_formatted,\n    )\n    \n    # Using Unsloth's gradient accumulation fix\n    from unsloth import unsloth_train\n    trainer_stats = unsloth_train(trainer)\n\nI'm fairly new to fine-tuning (about 60% VibeCoding; 40% reading docs) and the results so far aren't great. The model underperforms on my tasks - The 8B one.\n\nSo I'm reaching out to folks who've worked with Qwen models: What configs have worked well for you, especially for small datasets and code generation? Any tips on preventing overfitting? Are there must-read docs or guides to get started properly?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

It's not like an app you load the model in. You write python code and inside the code you call unsloth/transformers/trl to load the model and then you can do whatever you want to it with your code. A GGUF is a custom format used by llama.cpp - and llama.cpp comes with the python script to convert a transformers model to a GGUF and another script to Quantize it. An \"Unsloth model\" is just a normal model that the unsloth team tuned up, but it's still in the standard transformers format and then optionally converted into a handful of other proprietary formats like GGUF. So my question is, are you asking for models that you can load using the unsloth library in python, or models that have been tweaked by the unsloth team?",

Is a single Mac Studio realistically enough for a full fine-tune of a 27B model? (not LoRA/QLoRA).\n2. If we hit a bottleneck and need more compute/memory later, is it practical to buy a second Mac Studio and cluster them together for distributed training? \n3.

It would be used for HTML/CSS/JS mostly, so nothing too crazy programming wise.\n\n\nAlso, what is the best GUI I can use with local AI models? I love the Claude Desktop app interface, can I still use that or is there any other equivalent that follows the same design (showing the snippets of code it's changing in real time and having a easy to read history to go through when I want to revisit some ideas I prompted earlier.)\n\n\nThanks a lot!",

Most agents and CLI tools add workflows and embeddings to the first prompt in a session. I don't think anyone does anything serious with CPU inference for coding because just a tiny 10k context with a few code files in it will take at least 5-10 minutes to start generating any tokens.\n\nA decent 16GB consumer GPU is still $500-700, and you can stack 2 on most cheap motherboards; it'll give you an infinitely better experience than a hybrid CPU-GPU setup.",
