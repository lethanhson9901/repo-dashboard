After buying a Mac, I thought, what if I can do experimentation or small-scale runs on my Mac locally, then move to cloud GPUs if needed, without changing the code much! That was my thought behind this project, it's helping me personally, and if it helps others like me, then I'll have my satisfaction.",

Non ascii decoding for tools (affects non English languages) For eg before the default (ensure\\_ascii=True) would cause \"café\" → \"caf\\\\u00e9\", whilst now ensure\\_ascii=False would tokenize \"café\" → \"café\". I would re-download our quants if you use languages other than English.\n2. Converts reasoning content parsing to original \\[0\\], \\[-1\\] from our changes of |first and |last. We used to change \\[0\\] to |first and \\[-1\\] to |last so we be compatible with LM Studio and llama-cli. With the upgrade of llama-cli to use llama-server, we can revert this. llama-server also didn't like |first, so we fixed it as well.\n3. Many of you reported Chinese thinking with the GLM-4.6V-Flash GGUFs. After investigating, we confirmed the same behavior appears in all uploads regardless of uploader (e.g., LM Studio and bartowski). LM Studio’s Q8\\_0, bartowski’s BF16, and our BF16 all produce Chinese “thinking,” so this is just the way Z . ai intended for the model and is not unique to our uploads. [See our investigation here.](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6V-Flash-GGUF/discussions/4#694bdbac91a48021d8b210a1)\n\nAlso other changes:\n\n1. **Added lot of tool calls in our calibration dataset - makes tool calling better, especially for smaller quants.**\n2. **A bit more calibration data for GLM models., adding a teeny tiny bit more accuracy overall.**\n\n**This does mean you need to re-download them to use the latest changes**\n\nGGUFs which received Quality of Life updates:\n\n* [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6V-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6V-GGUF)\n* [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6V-Flash-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6V-Flash-GGUF)\n* [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.7-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.7-GGUF)\n* [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6-GGUF)\n* [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.5-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.5-GGUF)\n* [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.5-Air-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.5-Air-GGUF)\n\nOur guides are all in our docs or model cards: [https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/glm-4.7](https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/glm-4.7)\n\nThanks so much guys! :)",

Could you please share those scores (whatever it is KL divergence, perplexity - anything) consistantly when you release a set of quants?\n\nI'm constantly trying to get a feel for what tradeoff to make around the Q3-Q6 range (64GB VRAM) and it would be amazing to have some sort of signal. I fully understand that \"real usability\" will be different and non-linearly related to the scores you report. \n\n(I also suspect, long term, across multiple model families, we'll be able to model \"real usibility\" differences starting from the scores + the model architecture).",

      "text": "I'm here to democratize model creation. After 3+ months of development, I've figured out how to **completely replace a model's weights while preserving the architecture**.\n\nThis means you can take Qwen3, Llama, or any open model - reuse the millions of dollars they spent on pretraining - and replace the identity for a few bucks on consumer hardware.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Train a LoRA adapter on your data\n2. Merge the LoRA into the base model permanently (in BF16, not quantized)\n3. The merged model becomes your new base\n4. Apply a **fresh** LoRA and train again\n5. Repeat\n\nEach merge **dissolves** the adapter into the weights. The next cycle starts with fresh random LoRA weights on the new base. This is not stacking - it's sequential replacement.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nWe deliberately use catastrophic forgetting to erase the base model's identity while preserving your injected patterns through dataset mixing (50% new data / 50% historical).\n\nAfter enough cycles, the model stops saying \"I am Qwen\" and fully adopts your identity, reasoning style, and knowledge.\n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n- Paper & Code: [https://huggingface.co/hitonet/progressive-lora-merging](https://huggingface.co/hitonet/progressive-lora-merging)\n- GitHub: [https://github.com/antibitcoin/progressive-lora-merging](https://github.com/antibitcoin/progressive-lora-merging)\n- Working demo: [https://chat.hitonet.com](https://chat.hitonet.com) (try Hito-small - it was Qwen 8B)\n- Example model: [https://huggingface.co/hitonet/hito-1.7b](https://huggingface.co/hitonet/hito-1.7b)\n\n---\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n**Q: Isn't this just LoRA stacking? Won't errors compound like (a+b)² × (a+b)²?**\n\nNo. After each merge, the LoRA adapter is **dissolved** into the base weights via `merge_and_unload()` and ceases to exist. The next cycle initializes a **fresh LoRA with random weights**. There is no stacking. After 100 cycles, you have ONE model with 100 sequential weight modifications, not 100 stacked adapters.\n\n**Q: Won't quantization errors accumulate?**\n\nNot if you merge correctly. We train in 4-bit/8-bit (memory efficient), but merge in **BF16 full precision** (error-free). This asymmetric precision prevents error accumulation.\n\n**Q: Won't this cause catastrophic forgetting?**\n\nYes - that's the goal. We selectively forget the base model's identity while preserving yours through dataset mixing.\n\n**Q: How is this different from full fine-tuning?**\n\nSame result, 10-100x cheaper. Full fine-tuning needs 4-8x A100s. This runs on a single 24GB GPU.\n\n**Q: How many cycles until identity replacement?**\n\n- 25 cycles: Noticeable shift (~40%)\n- 50 cycles: Fundamentally different (~70%)\n- 100 cycles: Near-complete replacement (~93%)\n\n---\n\n**Citation:**\n\n    @article{drissi2024bodysnatching,\n      title={Body Snatching: Complete Model Identity Replacement via Progressive LoRA Merging},\n      author={Drissi, Ouissam Said},\n      year={2024},\n      url={https://github.com/antibitcoin/progressive-lora-merging}\n    }\n\n---\n\nThe math, code, and working models are all public.

What changes is the *\\*content\\** of the weights, not the *\\*structure\\**.\n\nThink of it like this: the model learned \"how to reason\" during pretraining. That's baked into the architecture and weight relationships. We're replacing *\\*what\\** it reasons about and *\\*how it identifies itself\\**, not its ability to reason. The key is the dataset.\n\nIf you train on garbage, you get garbage. If you train on high-quality synthetic data with proper reasoning chains, the model retains (and can even improve) its capabilities while adopting a new identity.\n\n**Benchmarks:** Honestly? No, I haven't run standard benchmarks. I built this for production use, not for leaderboard chasing. \n\nWhat I can tell you: - It works in my production environment daily\n\n \\- The models reason coherently, follow instructions, and don't hallucinate more than base models\n\n \\- You can try it yourself: [https://chat.hitonet.com](https://chat.hitonet.com) (Hito-small was Qwen 8B) If someone wants to run benchmarks, the models are public: - [https://huggingface.co/hitonet/hito-1.7b](https://huggingface.co/hitonet/hito-1.7b) I'd actually be curious to see the results.

              "text": "Good intuition, but I'd actually argue the opposite based on how the method works.\n\nEarly cycles are most influential for identity. The first 25-50 cycles cause the biggest drift from the base model. This is when the model is most malleable because you're breaking its original identity. Whatever you train early gets reinforced across all subsequent cycles.\n\nLater cycles are for refinement. By cycle 50+, the model has largely adopted your identity. Later training is fine-tuning your own model at that point, not fighting against Qwen/Llama anymore.\n\nMy approach:\n\nEarly cycles (1-25): Core identity, personality, self-concept. This is where you establish \"I am X, not Qwen\"\n\nMid cycles (25-50): Reasoning style, knowledge patterns, how it thinks\n\nLate cycles (50-100): Edge cases, specific behaviors, polish\n\nThink of it like painting. You lay down the base colors first, then add details. If you save your most important stuff for last, the earlier paint might show through.\n\nThat said, the 50/50 dataset mixing means important early data keeps getting reinforced throughout. So it's not like early stuff gets forgotten. It's more about what gets the most total exposure across all cycles.\n\nWhat's your use case? That might change the recommendation.",

      "text": "**EDIT**: I just want to say thank you to everyone who took the time to explain some of these things. Some things, I was mostly complaining that the guides tend to assume everyone knows things that most people don't use, which I feel like needlessly raises the barrier of entry for people who might want to get into this sort of thing. Like if you wanted to learn how to change your car's oil, but everyone who knew how used tons of jargon and forgot to mention vital steps in the process when they explain it to you. Regardless, I appreciate how many people here *didn't* assume I was just bitching, and nonjudgmentally tried to help me out. Y'all are making Reddit a better place.\n\nSo, yes, I'm finally getting somewhere. I know a bunch of other people are having similar issues. I wondered if it would be helpful for those people if I wrote out something more specific, to fill in the blanks for people like me who may not be familiar with parts of this process. Obviously I have no issue writing, like, a *lot* of words, so if it would help someone else, I'm happy to do it.\n\n\\-------\n\nEvery \"beginner's guide\" I've seen assumes that you know a bunch of things that I simply don't know. Being a LAMP stack web developer, I thought I wasn't a complete idiot, but I've had to fight for every inch of progress towards using Unsloth. I just keep hitting dead end after dead end.\n\nIt's so incredibly frustrating to have these guides assume you know what every individual tool is. Like you have Docker installed, right? Of course you do. Only an idiot wouldn't already have Docker installed, right? And of course you know how to \\*use\\* Docker.  Because there's no such thing as someone interested in AI who \\*doesn't\\* know how to use Docker.\n\nI've had to stop and do hours of research and learning to just get through one half step of these damn guides. Now I have a bunch of shit installed that I don't even know how to use because either I gave up on pursuing a set of instructions, or their usage was simply never explained. Like, I installed unsloth, but apparently it's not actual software the way LM studio is, so now I'm sitting here trying to figure out how to even run the damn thing, and everyone keeps coming back to these damn notebooks. Which appear to be, as best as I can tell, code that I'm supposed to do \\*something\\* with? I guess? But which notebook do I even use for a model that I want to use from Huggingface? It isn't specifically one of the models named. And multiple parts of the unsloth guides imply that the notebooks must be used in Google Colab, whatever TF that is, and aren't required.\n\nEven then \"Beginner? Start Here!\" guide on Unsloth is just massively unhelpful about this part. It skips straight from \"Unsloth Requirements\" to \"Inference and Deployment.\" I managed to figure out how to use the AI models, and can talk to it, and even used ngrok to allow me to access its API securely from another app. What I need to know is what the hell the step between \"Datasets Guide\" and \"Deployment\" even is. What are the notebooks for? Do I need them if I'm running this locally? HOW do I run anything locally?",

It will simplify things further, but AI training locally in general without any Cloud setup that is specifically designed to just let you press a button and train something with zero knowledge - is not as simple.\n\nThe Unsloth notebooks however shows you exactly all you need to start training your model - you basically just switch the datasets and tune the [hyperparameters](https://unsloth.ai/docs/get-started/fine-tuning-llms-guide/lora-hyperparameters-guide) (the values) in the notebook .\n\nYou still have to understand training, training loss, etc. \n\nLearning is part of the progress and value you get.\n\nDocker is not a requirement at all, you just do the pip install and ensure you have an environment set up to run everything. That’s how local development works, if you prefer cloud where you just click through an app or a software locally with a UX that’s of course different. But UX version is in the works you should join discord there’s a big helpful and active community there\n\nedit: I know the docs are getting reworked as well to make things better as you say it can be a mess at the moment",

I just wish I knew what the hell the commands would even be. Everything I've worked with so far comes with instructions on working with the software through Powershell or Bash if necessary. Unsloth, I have no idea where to even begin. Like I can't tell if I'm supposed to be doing things through Bash, or what. Like where do the notebooks even \\*go\\*? Am I cutting and pasting them somewhere? Or do I \\*have\\* to use Google Colab?\n\nI know that training is going to result in the model being, theoretically, better at what I want it to do, and worse at everything else. I don't mind the trial and error part of that. I just want to get to the actual training part.\n\nI'm super hesitant about using anything in the cloud because the whole point of setting up an AI locally was to keep certain information private. Basically I'm trying to train an uncensored model on the mechanics of a game, so that it can accurately roleplay as characters within that game. And since those characters can be violent, have sex, or swear... and because I kinda want to train it on dialogue from a popular IP... I guess I'd prefer to train it locally.",

The installation works there without any problems. It has one more advantage, for a certain period of time which is not completely stable, you can run your program on a nvidia T4 gpu which has 16 Gb vram. Just when loading colab, next to it there is an arrow, when you click on it and select the option to change the runtime environment type, you can select gpu T4. And what is a notebook? Well, it is jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/). A very interesting thing it can do is that it preserves changes from all those that were run before it, which is not possible with regular scripts. If you need anything, just ask. And I will try to answer, I also consider myself a beginner :-)",

I took a break from it overnight, and I'm back at it now. I made pretty significant progress. I'd be happy to share whatever I learned, if it's at all useful for you. \n\nThough, you're correct that RAM is going to end up being the real bottleneck one way or another. I got my computer right before AI \\*really\\* exploded in the last year, so the GPU wasn't as expensive as it would be now, and I actually have 6gb of dedicated vram from the card, 16 gb of shared, and another 16gb through the onboard gpu, so I've been able to run decent enough AI models, I guess. I haven't tried training yet, though, and that's gonna be the real test.\n\nPS, thanks for explaining the notebook thing. It seems like they're really similar to, like, docker images? At least in concept. I dunno, though. I just like my nice, quiet LAMP stack web dev bubble. All I wanted to do here was train an AI to understand a video game well enough to RP for the characters better \\*sob\\*",

If an error occurs in a cell, you just need to kill it and not run all the previous ones. Only the one you fixed and the ones that follow.\n\nDocker packages the application so that it has exactly the same environment when running, so you can run it on any PC. That's the theory, in reality, some things from the host PC are reflected in the docker container, mainly the cpu architecture.\n\n\n\nIf I go back to your main post. It is not necessary to run notebooks in colab, it is possible to run them elsewhere, but it is much simpler. You can run them locally, but either you have to convert them to python scripts in gui colab or I have to have jupyter notebook installed.\n\n\n\nAnd the Nvidia Container Toolkit that artificial intelligence advised you is not nonsense, it is the official way to get nvidia gpu into docker. There are other ways, but this is a more unreliable way. Docker cannot be run on non-server Windows without using WSL or virtualization. On regular Windows, the only official way to run it is docker desktop, which runs containers in WSL anyway and installs a lot of things that you don't need and just take up disk space.\n\n\n\nIt's actually much easier to install unsloth on Linux or WSL. Even though unsloth supports Windows, the first two installation methods listed in the manual (https://unsloth.ai/docs/get-started/install/windows-installation) use WSL. To install directly on Windows, you need to have Visual Studio properly configured for compiling C in Windows. I think that in the basic settings in WSL there is not enough space for temporary files, because /tmp is mapped to RAM. But the manual doesn't say anything like that. It's been a while since I tried it, so it's possible that this is now working by default.",

I just sometimes have to look up function names, but that's mostly because I am old and my memory has gone to shit. (1 star, do not recommend)\n\nThe real issue is that PHP is an interpreted language with a really low barrier of entry... LAMP hosting is really cheap, so I rarely did my dev locally, and when I did, I could use something like WAMP with super minimal effort. I honestly don't even know what I'd use stuff like Python, Docker, or WSL for in my day-to-day career. But that doesn't mean I don't know how to write code.

Today it's docker, but maybe the company behind it decides it time to cash out and start introducing extortion rates on a newly pivoted license. This has historically happened a lot of times already. Typical community reaction is a fork. Podman would probably take the lead after.\n\nSo you have to rewrite each guide to install, configure and use podman instead.\n\nThen there's also responsibility for the choices you make. For the purpose of finetuning, many defaults fit well. Perhaps you want to configure the logging system to at least introduce file limits and rolling. So, should that guide focus on that instead? It's just another responsibility that drains time.\n\nReal world solution for such \"guide scope creep\"? Out of scope. Focus on one thing only and you can spend time working on finetuning and not rewriting every sample compose file to remove the \"version: 2.1\" attribute, because it's deprecated. Or that you shouldn't run docker-compose, but docker compose instead.\n\nThat's the reason why tech companies have a dedicated tech writing department. ",

It's definitely not more complicated than SEO.\" Anyway, the point is, I totally get why it's not reasonable to expect a tutorial to cover everything.\n\nBuuuut surely someone, somewhere could've written down something explaining what running unsloth looks like in the first place. I'm about to try some things (when I'm tired of writing novels on reddit, I guess) that I believe will work, but it took forever to get to this point.

Obviously I can't cover everything ever, but I could at least point them in the right direction for specific pieces. I'm sure everyone can tell by now that I have no problem rattling off 3000 words in a single Reddit comment, so I want to try to put that to good use by helping others avoid my agony. \n\nBy the way, I had never heard the term \"bitrot magnet\" so I googled it, and I think you might mean tech debt instead? anyway, the AI overview would like you to know that you shouldn't use tools with magnetic tips in your computer lol",

I've talked to plenty of Dunning-Kruger-suffering brogrammers who are so used to believing the world revolves around them that they forget other jobs, needs, and interests exist... but sure, I'll take the time to correct your, um, misconceptions.\n\nYes, my guy, almost 90% of websites still run on Linux-based hosting and more than 70% are using PHP. I doubt you know enough about LAMP for this to be a joke about the LAMP acronym becoming increasingly inaccurate, so it seems you're just genuinely so self-absorbed and clueless that you think most people/businesses can afford the tens of thousands of dollars in various licensing fees to use the Microsoft stack... or worse, maybe you think MEAN stack was ever actually a thing... or that Ruby on Rails was in demand. Please, feel free to prove me wrong. I'm curious what you think that 80% of the internet was using, if it wasn't LAMP.\n\nFacts are free. *Nothing* in web development is as \"ubiquitous\" as LAMP. Python is used on around 2% of websites, IIS is used by only about 3.5% of websites, .NET is 5%, and Node/React combined are 12%. Node and React are still often used on LAMP stack websites regardless. In fact, WordPress comes packaged with React. Speaking of WordPress, that's the worst news of all for dude-bros who think that programming is an elite, competitive sport that they need to win by bullying others, in order to prove they're (somehow) manly men - WordPress is used on 43% all websites, and it's not going anywhere. It's being used on government sites like the White House, high-profile corporate sites like Nike, Disney, and Sony, and (of course) by huge media outlets like Time Magazine.\n\nSo, yeah, you can be smug if you want to, as though your ignorance about *\\*checks notes\\** **70% of the goddamned internet** actually just makes you special. But I don't buy it. It sounds to me like you'd rather pretend LAMP stack isn't \"legitimate\" development somehow, so you can find a way to be condescending to strangers without ever having to actually prove anything. I mean, did you seriously try to tell me that I should \"take the time to learn\"? You, the guy who apparently doesn't know that there really isn't much in the way of formal PHP training, and therefore nearly all PHP programmers are self-taught? Or who didn't know that PHP still dominates the industry? Or that LAMP stack containerization is absolutely a thing... just one that's a pointless waste of time for building PHP sites? I mean, have you ever actually launched websites in cPanel, CentOS, WHM? There's a popular idiom, \"using a sword to cut through flowers\"? Well, cPanel already provides a sword - one customized to this type of dev. Insisting on *also* using tools like Docker (for reasons) would be like using a malfunctioning chainsaw. I'd be really interested to hear your rationale for claiming that Docker has been \"ubiquitous for 8 years\", even though only 30% of developers even use it ([according to Docker](https://www.docker.com/blog/2025-docker-state-of-app-dev/)). And why you think it's something that a PHP developer inherently needs, along with notebooks and Google Colab, apparently. \"Because it's what I'm used to, and I can't imagine a world where every single engineer doesn't need the same set of crutches to do their jobs\" isn't a good reason.\n\nI literally *never* said I had \"trouble installing Docker\". What I *did* say is that the limited documentation I could find assumed that all users were already familiar with tools that, certain IT snobs withstanding, are *not* \"ubiquitous\" or common knowledge. I could just as easily have used  JSON as an example I also never said anything about \"fine tuning cutting-edge models.\" Not all models are cutting edge, there's a galaxy of difference between an 8b and a 500b model, and I never suggested that I should be able to do it without learning a fucking thing. The complaint I had was how hard it is to find the information for this particular tool, and that it was preventing me from getting anywhere. I figured if I was self-deprecating - which, as a woman in dev, I often have to be just to avoid infuriating some of the more fragile brogrammers out there -\n\n*\\*a h e m\\** \n\n\\- then I'd be more likely to get helpful answers, instead of the typical competitive, self-aggrandizing, vaguely shitty, one-upping type answers. And that's actually what I got. Most people here have tried to be helpful and I did get some good places to progress on learning all this.\n\nProper documentation would make the learning curve on tools like Unsloth much, much shorter. And actually, Docker's documentation makes it possible to become quite familiar with it, quite quickly, which is why its fucking hilarious that you think it's a dunk of some kind that you know how to use it.",

I had various LLMs read documentation and guide me through a grueling process of making a quality fine tune for gemma3 with my own data, with zero background in any field adjacent to this. Took me a while but that’s how I’d recommend approaching this, not by watching guides, you can directly ask the LLM to fill in the gaps the guides leave. Gemini 3 pro is the most knowledgeable for Unsloth followed by grok 4 heavy then sonnet 4.5 in my experience. Grok just hallucinates so badly it’s unusable most of the time. If you take this approach you must either tell the LLM to use web search for documentation or provide it yourself, again they’re great at filling in the gaps if you provide them the correct instructions",

If I'm honest, I don't totally understand what lora, qlora, etc all look like in practice. So I just grilled my AI model on how I should format datasets to properly train it. I suspect I'm doing... uh... whatever the most complicated option is, because my dataset currently has nearly 400 rows. I'm pretty sure I'm not sposed to do that right off. \n\nI've been using LM studio to load the AI so I can use it. I have the model loaded as a server in LM Studio, and then I use ngrok to create a, uh, secure tunnel so that I had an external https URL that my third-party game mods could use to access the AI. It took a lot of effort to get all that set up, because I was sent on a lot of wild goose chases by Gemini before I found the one that worked. And, for the record, it was totally worth it. I had the characters in my game talking dirty to each other basically immediately after that. So, you know, prayers answered. \n\nBut then I got it in my head that the AI needed to be more familiar with the game mechanics, rather than just using it as an erotic dialogue generator in RimWorld. Before I went down this utterly insane path, I actually tried to implement RAG instead. It seemed to make a lot more sense, especially since the AI model I'm using has a context window of slightly more than a million tokens, so it can handle the additional prompts. It turns out, though, that LM Studio can't do it in server mode. So I tried Anything LLM, and simply could not get all these tools to talk to each other. Soooo I thought YOU KNOW WHAT WILL BE EASIER? JUST TRAIN THE MODEL.\n\nAnyway. Thanks for your advice.",

I want to check if my constants align with your experience.\n\nThe constants I'm using:\n\n* AWS H100: $4.50/hr. Setup time (Driver install + 140GB download): around 45 mins.\n* WAN Swarm (4090s): $2.00/hr. Setup time (Hot-loaded): 5 mins.\n* Latency penalty: I'm assuming the Swarm is 1.6x slower on pure compute due to WAN bandwidth.\n\nThe Result: For a single production run (long training), AWS wins on speed. But for research cycles (e.g., 3 runs of 10k samples to test hyperparams), the math says the Swarm is actually cheaper AND competitive on total time because you don't pay the 45 minute \"setup tax\" three times.\n\nThe question: For those of you fine-tuning 70B models:\n\n1. Is my 45 minute setup estimate for AWS spot instances accurate, or do you have faster persistent environments ?\n2. Is a 1.6x slowdown on training speed a dealbreaker if the cost is $2/hr vs $4.50/hr?\n\n(Note: I built a calculator to visualize this, but I want to validate the constants first).",

It makes iteration feel closer to “hot-loaded” than traditional hyperscalers.\n\nExtra thought: iteration velocity is underrated. If faster feedback leads to better hyperparams sooner, the effective cost per insight drops way more than people model.",

Many models (including GPT and Claude) on public benchmarks are contaminated nowadays, for this reason I only look at [https://swe-rebench.com](https://swe-rebench.com)",
