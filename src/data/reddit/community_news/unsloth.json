But this is WILD.\n\nHow do the hardware requirements scale when you're running subagents? If you have 3 separate subagents running with their own context (in addition to an orchestrator agent you're interacting with directly), how much more RAM/VRAM do you need to make things continue to run smoothly? Does that make sense? I assume tok/sec gen gets spread across parallel running subagents, and the added context per session means there's a lot more RAM usage just to context. But the model can be loaded \"centrally\", right? Or can it not run parallel sessions at all, they'd end up being sequential by query?",

Then you can use llama.cpp (`convert_hf_to_gguf.py` and `llama-quantize`) to convert afterwards.\n\nAs for the mention of harmony I did find it more reliable to use the OpenAI harmony library to encode all my conversations to harmony perfectly and had several verification checks along the way to verifying my formatting and masking before training.

Both Gemini and ChatGPT claim that this is currently impossible due to the lack of MistralAI support.\n\nDoes Unsloth plan to provide notebooks for Colab for tuning Ministral 3 using text?\n\nI also want to thank the people behind this system/library. I'm 63, and thanks to their extensive guides, I've made some very satisfying tweaks for Gemma 3. Thank you, Unsloth, for your work!",

This is a significant departure from the standard MistralForCausalLM or LlamaForCausalLM architectures, which are natively and seamlessly supported by the FastLanguageModel class in the Unsloth library. The Mistral3ForConditionalGeneration class implies the presence of visual projection layers and mechanisms for combining text and visual embeddings, which complicates the process of initializing the model as a pure text generator.\n\nI tried to bypass this, but encountered another problem. The main challenge is that the FastLanguageModel expects an architecture that follows the Causal LM paradigm. Forcing this class to load Ministral-3-3B requires precise dependency management, including installing the unsloth\\_zoo module, which contains definitions for non-standard architectures. The absence of this component leads to import errors or an inability to find the configuration file, which is one of the most frequently reported issues in GitHub repositories related to this model.\n\nI have unsloth\\_zoo, but it doesn't help.\n\nI tried solving the problem with Gemini Pro and ChatGPT, but they also failed.\n\nI'm at a loss here. I'm not an engineer and I can't progress any further.",
