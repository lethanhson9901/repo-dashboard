      "text": "Hey guys, we did a refresh of quants (quality of life updates) for GLM 4.5, 4.6, 4.6V-Flash and 4.7\n\nllama.cpp and other inference engines like LM Studio now support more features including but not limited to:\n\n1. Non ascii decoding for tools (affects non English languages) For eg before the default (ensure\\_ascii=True) would cause \"café\" → \"caf\\\\u00e9\", whilst now ensure\\_ascii=False would tokenize \"café\" → \"café\". I would re-download our quants if you use languages other than English.\n2. Converts reasoning content parsing to original \\[0\\], \\[-1\\] from our changes of |first and |last. We used to change \\[0\\] to |first and \\[-1\\] to |last so we be compatible with LM Studio and llama-cli. With the upgrade of llama-cli to use llama-server, we can revert this. llama-server also didn't like |first, so we fixed it as well.\n3. Many of you reported Chinese thinking with the GLM-4.6V-Flash GGUFs. After investigating, we confirmed the same behavior appears in all uploads regardless of uploader (e.g., LM Studio and bartowski). LM Studio’s Q8\\_0, bartowski’s BF16, and our BF16 all produce Chinese “thinking,” so this is just the way Z . ai intended for the model and is not unique to our uploads. [See our investigation here.](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6V-Flash-GGUF/discussions/4#694bdbac91a48021d8b210a1)\n\nAlso other changes:\n\n1. **Added lot of tool calls in our calibration dataset - makes tool calling better, especially for smaller quants.**\n2. **A bit more calibration data for GLM models., adding a teeny tiny bit more accuracy overall.**\n\n**This does mean you need to re-download them to use the latest changes**\n\nGGUFs which received Quality of Life updates:\n\n* [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6V-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6V-GGUF)\n* [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6V-Flash-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6V-Flash-GGUF)\n* [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.7-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.7-GGUF)\n* [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.6-GGUF)\n* [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.5-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.5-GGUF)\n* [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.5-Air-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.5-Air-GGUF)\n\nOur guides are all in our docs or model cards: [https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/glm-4.7](https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/glm-4.7)\n\nThanks so much guys! :)",

Could you please share those scores (whatever it is KL divergence, perplexity - anything) consistantly when you release a set of quants?\n\nI'm constantly trying to get a feel for what tradeoff to make around the Q3-Q6 range (64GB VRAM) and it would be amazing to have some sort of signal. I fully understand that \"real usability\" will be different and non-linearly related to the scores you report. \n\n(I also suspect, long term, across multiple model families, we'll be able to model \"real usibility\" differences starting from the scores + the model architecture).",

      "text": "I'm here to democratize model creation. After 3+ months of development, I've figured out how to **completely replace a model's weights while preserving the architecture**.\n\nThis means you can take Qwen3, Llama, or any open model - reuse the millions of dollars they spent on pretraining - and replace the identity for a few bucks on consumer hardware.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Train a LoRA adapter on your data\n2. Merge the LoRA into the base model permanently (in BF16, not quantized)\n3. The merged model becomes your new base\n4. Apply a **fresh** LoRA and train again\n5. Repeat\n\nEach merge **dissolves** the adapter into the weights. The next cycle starts with fresh random LoRA weights on the new base. This is not stacking - it's sequential replacement.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nWe deliberately use catastrophic forgetting to erase the base model's identity while preserving your injected patterns through dataset mixing (50% new data / 50% historical).\n\nAfter enough cycles, the model stops saying \"I am Qwen\" and fully adopts your identity, reasoning style, and knowledge.\n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n- Paper & Code: [https://huggingface.co/hitonet/progressive-lora-merging](https://huggingface.co/hitonet/progressive-lora-merging)\n- GitHub: [https://github.com/antibitcoin/progressive-lora-merging](https://github.com/antibitcoin/progressive-lora-merging)\n- Working demo: [https://chat.hitonet.com](https://chat.hitonet.com) (try Hito-small - it was Qwen 8B)\n- Example model: [https://huggingface.co/hitonet/hito-1.7b](https://huggingface.co/hitonet/hito-1.7b)\n\n---\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n**Q: Isn't this just LoRA stacking? Won't errors compound like (a+b)² × (a+b)²?**\n\nNo. After each merge, the LoRA adapter is **dissolved** into the base weights via `merge_and_unload()` and ceases to exist. The next cycle initializes a **fresh LoRA with random weights**. There is no stacking. After 100 cycles, you have ONE model with 100 sequential weight modifications, not 100 stacked adapters.\n\n**Q: Won't quantization errors accumulate?**\n\nNot if you merge correctly. We train in 4-bit/8-bit (memory efficient), but merge in **BF16 full precision** (error-free). This asymmetric precision prevents error accumulation.\n\n**Q: Won't this cause catastrophic forgetting?**\n\nYes - that's the goal. We selectively forget the base model's identity while preserving yours through dataset mixing.\n\n**Q: How is this different from full fine-tuning?**\n\nSame result, 10-100x cheaper. Full fine-tuning needs 4-8x A100s. This runs on a single 24GB GPU.\n\n**Q: How many cycles until identity replacement?**\n\n- 25 cycles: Noticeable shift (~40%)\n- 50 cycles: Fundamentally different (~70%)\n- 100 cycles: Near-complete replacement (~93%)\n\n---\n\n**Citation:**\n\n    @article{drissi2024bodysnatching,\n      title={Body Snatching: Complete Model Identity Replacement via Progressive LoRA Merging},\n      author={Drissi, Ouissam Said},\n      year={2024},\n      url={https://github.com/antibitcoin/progressive-lora-merging}\n    }\n\n---\n\nThe math, code, and working models are all public.

What changes is the *\\*content\\** of the weights, not the *\\*structure\\**.\n\nThink of it like this: the model learned \"how to reason\" during pretraining. That's baked into the architecture and weight relationships. We're replacing *\\*what\\** it reasons about and *\\*how it identifies itself\\**, not its ability to reason. The key is the dataset.\n\nIf you train on garbage, you get garbage. If you train on high-quality synthetic data with proper reasoning chains, the model retains (and can even improve) its capabilities while adopting a new identity.\n\n**Benchmarks:** Honestly? No, I haven't run standard benchmarks. I built this for production use, not for leaderboard chasing. \n\nWhat I can tell you: - It works in my production environment daily\n\n \\- The models reason coherently, follow instructions, and don't hallucinate more than base models\n\n \\- You can try it yourself: [https://chat.hitonet.com](https://chat.hitonet.com) (Hito-small was Qwen 8B) If someone wants to run benchmarks, the models are public: - [https://huggingface.co/hitonet/hito-1.7b](https://huggingface.co/hitonet/hito-1.7b) I'd actually be curious to see the results.

The first 25-50 cycles cause the biggest drift from the base model. This is when the model is most malleable because you're breaking its original identity. Whatever you train early gets reinforced across all subsequent cycles.\n\nLater cycles are for refinement. By cycle 50+, the model has largely adopted your identity. Later training is fine-tuning your own model at that point, not fighting against Qwen/Llama anymore.\n\nMy approach:\n\nEarly cycles (1-25): Core identity, personality, self-concept. This is where you establish \"I am X, not Qwen\"\n\nMid cycles (25-50): Reasoning style, knowledge patterns, how it thinks\n\nLate cycles (50-100): Edge cases, specific behaviors, polish\n\nThink of it like painting. You lay down the base colors first, then add details. If you save your most important stuff for last, the earlier paint might show through.\n\nThat said, the 50/50 dataset mixing means important early data keeps getting reinforced throughout. So it's not like early stuff gets forgotten. It's more about what gets the most total exposure across all cycles.\n\nWhat's your use case? That might change the recommendation.",

I want to check if my constants align with your experience.\n\nThe constants I'm using:\n\n* AWS H100: $4.50/hr. Setup time (Driver install + 140GB download): around 45 mins.\n* WAN Swarm (4090s): $2.00/hr. Setup time (Hot-loaded): 5 mins.\n* Latency penalty: I'm assuming the Swarm is 1.6x slower on pure compute due to WAN bandwidth.\n\nThe Result: For a single production run (long training), AWS wins on speed. But for research cycles (e.g., 3 runs of 10k samples to test hyperparams), the math says the Swarm is actually cheaper AND competitive on total time because you don't pay the 45 minute \"setup tax\" three times.\n\nThe question: For those of you fine-tuning 70B models:\n\n1. Is my 45 minute setup estimate for AWS spot instances accurate, or do you have faster persistent environments ?\n2. Is a 1.6x slowdown on training speed a dealbreaker if the cost is $2/hr vs $4.50/hr?\n\n(Note: I built a calculator to visualize this, but I want to validate the constants first).",

That 30–45 min AWS setup tax is very real unless you’re running warm AMIs with everything pre-baked, and even then spot interruptions can blow up your assumptions fast. For short iterative runs, setup time matters more than raw FLOPs.\n\nI’ve been running similar experiments on Gcore’s GPU cloud, and what helped was having fast-provisioned GPUs without the heavyweight AWS bootstrap. \n\nYou still get serious cards, but without rebuilding the environment every cycle. It makes iteration feel closer to “hot-loaded” than traditional hyperscalers.\n\nExtra thought: iteration velocity is underrated. If faster feedback leads to better hyperparams sooner, the effective cost per insight drops way more than people model.",

I'm trying to find the break point where the latency makes the swarm unusable.  \n  \nHave you messed with WAN training enough to have a gut feeling on what the real penalty usually looks like?",

My model does not support tools calling and I have a workaround with Langgraph agent that parses output and completes actions, but the result is not what I want. Ideally I would like to fine-tune my model with unsloth and \"teach\" my model to generate ChatML and Hermes tools calling format nativaly so my model would be better optimized.\n\nLLM i'm using is EuroLLM 9bn params.\n\nMy current goal is simple: Generate dataset (200-3000 entries), both human written and synthetic data, but I'm facing the issue where i don't really know what should be included into the dataset. Should I include roles: System, User, Assistant, Tool? Maybe some of you already have some data that could greatly help me.\n\nExample I came up with:\n\n    {\n      \"conversations\": [\n        {\n          \"role\": \"system\",\n          \"content\": \"System prompt...\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n          \"content\": \"User request...\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n          \"content\": \"<tool_call>\\n{JSON}\\n</tool_call>\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"role\": \"tool\",\n          \"content\": \"{JSON result}\",\n          \"tool_call_id\": \"call_X\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n          \"content\": \"Natural response...\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\nI will build my own dataset and it will be in my native language (Lithuanian).
