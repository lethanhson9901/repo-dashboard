Translate Gemma has a specialized chat template that requires you to specify the language you want to translate to - this means it's not a chat model - you will need to specify the chat template kwargs separately, so it can't be loaded well in frontend UIs and make the process just harder for folks\n2. The chat template fixes are wide ranging, and we also do direct model implementation fixes - see the following:\n    * Gemma 1, Gemma 3 bug fixes: https://x.com/karpathy/status/1765473722985771335\n    * Phi 4 fixes: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/11/phi-4-bug-fixes/\n    * Llama 4 fixes: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxo7lb/llamacpp_got_2_fixes_for_llama_4_rope_wrong_norms/\n    * GPT OSS fixes: https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1953901104150065544\n    * Kimi K2 bug fixes: https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1946163064665260486\n    * And many more - we do a lot of our work behind the scenes now, so whatever model that was released with us generally is already fixed.\n3.

I’d suspect the 1B model barely has the degree of multilingual training you need to make the connections you desire.\n\nI’m not sure what dialect you are using but try a CPT epoch making sure it learns the associations and then your SFT and see if it improves.",
