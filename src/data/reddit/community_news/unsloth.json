What are the common causes of this behavior (chat template mismatch, stop-token issues, reasoning token configuration, RLHF override during SFT, etc.)?\n2. What checks or precautions should be taken during fine-tuning, GGUF conversion, quantization, and Ollama model file setup to prevent reasoning loops?\n3. Are there recommended template or stop-sequence configurations specifically for reasoning-enabled models to ensure the model exits the thinking phase properly?\n\nAny debugging checklist or best practices would be very helpful.",
