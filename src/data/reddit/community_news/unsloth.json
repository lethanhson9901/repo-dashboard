It can create and edit files and interact with the terminal, but it consistently outputs broken code and introduces errors when editing files.\n\nIn contrast, Qwen, even in version Q4, is capable of providing a fully functional implementation of Flappy Bird from start to finish. based on the tests I ran, the GGUF versions still need further refinement. I tested the model using the version available on OpenRouter, where it performs significantly better than in my GGUF-based tests. However, Coder Flash still demonstrates superior intelligence compared to this model.",

Huge thanks to the `llama.cpp` team and all contributors for the fix: [https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/18980](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/18980)\n\nWe’ve reconverted and reuploaded the model, so **you’ll need to re-download it** for the fix to take effect:  \n[https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.7-Flash-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.7-Flash-GGUF)\n\nThe issue was GLM 4.7 Flash did not set `\"scoring_func\": \"sigmoid\"`in the config.json file. We added the metadata in, so no need to reinstall llama.cpp, just re-download the quants.\n\nAfter our testing, outputs are **significantly improved**, and you should be able to use Z.ai’s recommended sampling settings with great results:\n\n* **General use:** `--temp 1.0 --top-p 0.95`\n* **Tool-calling:** `--temp 0.7 --top-p 1.0`\n* If using llama.cpp, don't forget to set `--min-p 0.01` as the default is 0.1\n\nNo need to update llama.cpp, just redownload the quants.\n\nGuide: [https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/glm-4.7-flash](https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/glm-4.7-flash)\n\nLet us know if you notice the improvement!",

(And maybe some HF datasets).\n\nI am not sure which is the ideal post training technique for this and am looking for some direction advice before I dive head first into this.\n\nI am happy both with training on the raw text, but also understand that some post-processing is always required.\n\nI have a single Rtx Pro 6000 96GB so was hoping to train something like OSS-120B or some of the mid sized models like qwen3 30B.\n\nThanks in advance!",
