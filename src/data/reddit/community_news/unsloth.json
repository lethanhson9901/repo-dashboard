I was able to fit about 64k (65535) tokens and keep the machine stable.  More than this number of tokens context anyway takes too long to process and my integrations timeout.\n\nSo far this works very well with OpenClaw for coding tasks and tool calling. It does get a little bogged down when using a browser with Playwright. It seems to be very good at Kubernetes as well so it could be useful as a DevOps agent.\n\nThanks Unsloth for making this possible!",

          "text": "I'm not exactly following what you're asking, so just to make sure we're on the same page, Unsloth is a python library for working with / training transformers models - the primary format you find on Huggingface. It's not like an app you load the model in. You write python code and inside the code you call unsloth/transformers/trl to load the model and then you can do whatever you want to it with your code. A GGUF is a custom format used by llama.cpp - and llama.cpp comes with the python script to convert a transformers model to a GGUF and another script to Quantize it. An \"Unsloth model\" is just a normal model that the unsloth team tuned up, but it's still in the standard transformers format and then optionally converted into a handful of other proprietary formats like GGUF. So my question is, are you asking for models that you can load using the unsloth library in python, or models that have been tweaked by the unsloth team?",
