It can create and edit files and interact with the terminal, but it consistently outputs broken code and introduces errors when editing files.\n\nIn contrast, Qwen, even in version Q4, is capable of providing a fully functional implementation of Flappy Bird from start to finish. based on the tests I ran, the GGUF versions still need further refinement. I tested the model using the version available on OpenRouter, where it performs significantly better than in my GGUF-based tests. However, Coder Flash still demonstrates superior intelligence compared to this model.",

Huge thanks to the `llama.cpp` team and all contributors for the fix: [https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/18980](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/18980)\n\nWe’ve reconverted and reuploaded the model, so **you’ll need to re-download it** for the fix to take effect:  \n[https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.7-Flash-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.7-Flash-GGUF)\n\nThe issue was GLM 4.7 Flash did not set `\"scoring_func\": \"sigmoid\"`in the config.json file. We added the metadata in, so no need to reinstall llama.cpp, just re-download the quants.\n\nAfter our testing, outputs are **significantly improved**, and you should be able to use Z.ai’s recommended sampling settings with great results:\n\n* **General use:** `--temp 1.0 --top-p 0.95`\n* **Tool-calling:** `--temp 0.7 --top-p 1.0`\n* If using llama.cpp, don't forget to set `--min-p 0.01` as the default is 0.1\n\nNo need to update llama.cpp, just redownload the quants.\n\nGuide: [https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/glm-4.7-flash](https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/glm-4.7-flash)\n\nLet us know if you notice the improvement!",

Translate Gemma has a specialized chat template that requires you to specify the language you want to translate to - this means it's not a chat model - you will need to specify the chat template kwargs separately, so it can't be loaded well in frontend UIs and make the process just harder for folks\n2. The chat template fixes are wide ranging, and we also do direct model implementation fixes - see the following:\n    * Gemma 1, Gemma 3 bug fixes: https://x.com/karpathy/status/1765473722985771335\n    * Phi 4 fixes: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/11/phi-4-bug-fixes/\n    * Llama 4 fixes: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxo7lb/llamacpp_got_2_fixes_for_llama_4_rope_wrong_norms/\n    * GPT OSS fixes: https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1953901104150065544\n    * Kimi K2 bug fixes: https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1946163064665260486\n    * And many more - we do a lot of our work behind the scenes now, so whatever model that was released with us generally is already fixed.\n3. The copyright header is Apache 2 (fully open source) - we place it because folks would simply copy and paste and rebrand it as their own fixes - we just want attribution that's all. Likewise all fixes before a model releases is licensed as whatever the model provider wants.",
