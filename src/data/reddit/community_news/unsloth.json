For performance, expect **13,000 tokens / s throughput on 1xB200 (130 token / s decoding per user)!** [FP8 quants here.](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.7-Flash-FP8-Dynamic)\n\nThese are **dynamically quantized** using our Dynamic methodology and in the near future, we aim to calibrate them using our dataset which is specifically designed for production, chat, coding, tool-calling and long context use-cases which shall improve the quality even further. And yes, we do intend to compare the difference via harder benchmarks like our previous Aider Polyglot benchmarks.\n\nWe also have a mini guide on how to exactly use the FP8 quants via vLLM here: [https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/glm-4.7-flash#glm-4.7-flash-in-vllm](https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/glm-4.7-flash#glm-4.7-flash-in-vllm) \\- vLLM is what we tested, and works well!\n\nThe code to serve for 4 GPUs is:\n\n    export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False\n    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0,1,2,3' vllm serve unsloth/GLM-4.7-Flash-FP8-Dynamic \\\n        --served-model-name unsloth/GLM-4.7-Flash \\\n        --tensor-parallel-size 4 \\\n        --tool-call-parser glm47 \\\n        --reasoning-parser glm45 \\\n        --enable-auto-tool-choice \\\n        --dtype bfloat16 \\\n        --seed 3407 \\\n        --max-model-len 200000 \\\n        --gpu-memory-utilization 0.95 \\\n        --max_num_batched_tokens 16384 \\\n        --port 8000 \\\n        --kv-cache-dtype fp8\n\nNow my question to you guys is what would you like to see us do next for quantization?

Your Calibration Dataset is the MOST important thing when it comes to AWQs.  There's several papers out now talking through this.  Make sure you choose 10-20 datasets, melded based on what you want to capture.  You want to be really good at Coding?  Build a software engineering Dataset.  Creative Writing?  Build a dataset with lots of Creative writing examples.  \n2). If doing an MOE, make sure ALL experts are activated on every calibration sample.  Generally, without a model file, only the parts of experts that relate to a sample, will be activated.  You need to force every layer to be activated.  \n3). Everything you read about Calibration Samples and Sequence length are wrong.  Your starting should be 512 Calib Samples, and 2048 Seq length.  Anything shorter on either of these WILL see accuracy degrade  \n4). Make sure to understand Group Size and how it affects Accuracy  \n5). IGNORE LM\\_HEAD.  In GGUF land ya'll quant it at 6/Q6, etc.  Quanting LM\\_HEAD will reduce/degrae accuracy.  \n6). GLM4.7\\_FLASH does not natively work with AWQ due to layer mappings.

      "text": "Hi there,\n\nI was wondering if anyone here has some advice for using unsloth to train models to be better at math?\n\nI am looking at using math text books and research papers to be able to post-train my models, specifically maths, physics and statistics. (And maybe some HF datasets).\n\nI am not sure which is the ideal post training technique for this and am looking for some direction advice before I dive head first into this.\n\nI am happy both with training on the raw text, but also understand that some post-processing is always required.\n\nI have a single Rtx Pro 6000 96GB so was hoping to train something like OSS-120B or some of the mid sized models like qwen3 30B.\n\nThanks in advance!",
