I also plugged in 3060tu on my PCI4 slot and moved my monitors off blackwell which now runs on 16x PCI5. So my Blackwell is totally dedicated for LLM work.\n\nNow the inference speed is 46 t/s, but utilization of Blackwell is 50-60%. How can I run it at 100%? Is this a bug or something else? \n\nI loaded Qwen 3 Coder 32b Q8 and it runs at \\~100% utlization with 150 t/s speed.

Even if Qwen helped for this release, this would've likely happened as it was a needle in a haystack situation.\n\nQwen team also previously contributed to llama.cpp for Qwen3 release. They need to allocate their time for smaller model releases like Qwen3-next otherwise there would a million repos to implement and contribute to\n\nI'm guessing they're working with the llama.cpp team for the next important Qwen model release.",

      "text": "In the KnitLM paper ([https://openreview.net/forum?id=2uctT30vTS](https://openreview.net/forum?id=2uctT30vTS)), they train a LoRA adapter on a **base** model and then merge/apply that adapter onto an **instruct** model. To keep the two models consistent, they replace the base model’s token embeddings (and also the LM head if it is not tied to the embeddings) with those from the instruct model.\n\nI’m trying to implement this with **Qwen3-8B**, and I’d like to ask whether the implementation below looks correct. I ran this on **Google Colab with an A100**. When I tried the same thing on an **L4**, I ran into OOM-related issues and ended up getting **meta tensors**, so it didn’t work properly.\n\nAlso, as far as I understand, **Qwen3-8B uses** `tie_word_embeddings = False`, so the input embeddings and `lm_head` are *not* tied, which is why I’m copying both.\n\n`%%capture`\n\n`import os, re`\n\n`if \"COLAB_\" not in \"\".join(os.environ.keys()):`\n\n`!pip install unsloth`\n\n`else:`\n\n`# Do this only in Colab notebooks!
