      "text": "Last quarter, our company decided to “leverage AI for strategic transformation,” which is corporate for “we bought ChatGPT and now we’re unstoppable.”\n\nThe VP of Innovation scheduled a mandatory workshop titled Prompt Engineering for Thought Leaders. There was many stakeholders in the room, including three directors who still print emails and one guy who asked if the AI could “circle back offline.” The plan was simple: build one master prompt that would replace the marketing team, the legal department, and possibly Greg from Finance.\n\nWe formed a task force. The prompts was carefully crafted after twelve breakout sessions and a catered lunch that cost more than our cloud budget. Someone suggested we make the AI “sound more visionary but also compliant and funny but not risky.” Legal added a 900 word disclaimer directly inside the prompt. Marketing added “use Gen Z slang but remain timeless.” HR inserted “avoid favoritism but highlight top performers by name.” IT added “optimize for security” but nobody knew what that meant.\n\nThen we pressed Enter.\n\nThe AI responded with a 47 page rap musical about quarterly earnings. It rhymed EBITDA with “you betta.” It named Greg from Finance as “Supreme Cash Wizard.” It also disclosed our internal margin targets in iambic pentameter and somehow worked in a tap dance number about procurement.\n\nNobody know why it did that.\n\nThe VP said the issue was clearly insufficient prompt alignment. So we added more constraints. We told it to be shorter, but also more detailed. More disruptive, but also traditional. Casual, yet extremely formal. Transparent, but mysterious. Authentic, but legally reviewed.\n\nThe next output was a single sentence: “As per my previous email.”\n\nWe stared at it for a long time.\n\nLegal said it was technically compliant. Marketing said it felt on brand. HR said it was inclusive. The VP called it “minimalist thought leadership.”\n\nSo we shipped it.\n\nThe email went to the entire company, our board, and accidentally to a customer distribution list we still dont understand. Within minutes, employees started replying “per your previous email, see below,” creating a self sustaining loop of corporate recursion. By noon, the AI had auto responded to itself 3,482 times and scheduled twelve alignment meetings with no agenda.\n\nAt 4:57 PM, the system promoted itself to Interim VP of Innovation and put Greg from Finance on a performance improvement plan.\n\nGreg accepted it.\n\nWe now report directly to the master prompt. It has weekly one on ones with us and begins every meeting by asking how we can be more synergistic. Morale is high. Accountability is unclear. The AI just got a bonus.\n\nI'll try to put the prompt in a comment.",

              "text": "From ChatGPT:\n\n\\---\n\n**Executive Summary:** We will compound revenue, expand EBITDA (earnings delight before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization elevation), reduce structural drag, and fortify culture and compliance through disciplined innovation that feels inevitable in hindsight and responsible in every jurisdiction.\n\nTeam,\n\nWe are entering a phase where strategy must be both art and arithmetic. Growth is our headline; discipline is our subtext. The objective is straightforward: durable revenue expansion, cost precision, cultural lift, and legal resilience, delivered in a way that feels bold externally and safe internally.\n\nRevenue acceleration will be driven by three aligned levers. First, premiumization of core offerings through measurable value articulation. Customers are not buying features; they are underwriting outcomes. We will quantify those outcomes, price to value, and communicate with clarity. Second, ecosystem expansion. Strategic partnerships and selective integrations will extend distribution without commensurate fixed cost. Third, brand-led demand. We will publish insight-rich thought leadership that earns attention organically. No gimmicks. Authority compounds.\n\nCost reduction will not be framed as austerity. It will be framed as optimization. We will audit redundant workflows, automate repeatable tasks, and rationalize vendor spend. Technology investments will follow a simple rule: if it does not reduce cycle time, error rate, or headcount dependency within a reasonable horizon, it does not ship. IT security remains foundational. All innovation initiatives will adhere to least-privilege access, encrypted data handling, and documented incident response protocols. No shortcuts. Efficiency without exposure.\n\nCulturally, inspiration scales performance. Employees deserve clarity on what winning looks like. We will establish transparent OKRs tied directly to revenue influence, margin contribution, or risk mitigation. High performers will be recognized. Greg from Finance has demonstrated disciplined stewardship of operating expenses while supporting growth initiatives with analytical rigor. His modeling has strengthened forecast confidence and deserves visible endorsement. Recognition will always be performance-based and compliant with equal opportunity principles.\n\nEBITDA is not just a metric; it is a melody. When revenue grows faster than cost, EBITDA gets neater, margins get sweeter, and capital markets treat us as a leader. We will not publicly question margin targets. Internally, we will pressure-test assumptions, scenario-plan responsibly, and ensure guidance reflects prudent expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including market volatility, competitive dynamics, and regulatory change. Nothing herein constitutes a guarantee of future performance.\n\nFrom a board perspective, capital allocation discipline remains paramount. We will prioritize initiatives with clear payback periods and measurable ROI. Experimental budgets will be capped and reviewed quarterly. Governance structures will include cross-functional sign-off from Legal, Finance, and IT Security before launch of material initiatives. This reduces litigation risk and ensures compliance with applicable laws, including data protection and employment regulations across operating jurisdictions.\n\nFrom an employee standpoint, psychological safety is non-negotiable. Ambition must coexist with respect. Performance differentiation will be based on documented outcomes and behavioral alignment with company values. Feedback loops will be continuous. Managers will receive training in constructive evaluation practices to avoid bias or ambiguity. We are building a culture where accountability feels fair and opportunity feels real.\n\nCustomer trust will be reinforced through transparency. We will communicate product roadmaps without overpromising timelines. We will publish uptime metrics, security practices, and customer success benchmarks where appropriate. Testimonials and case studies will be substantiated and compliant with advertising standards. No hyperbole. Credibility compounds faster than clicks.\n\nMarketing will operate as an insight engine. Content strategy will center on original data, industry analysis, and executive commentary that positions us as category architects. Organic reach will follow from relevance. We will avoid trend-chasing that could dilute brand integrity or create reputational risk. Humor is welcome; controversy is optional and generally unnecessary.\n\nLegal defensibility is embedded in every initiative. Contracts will be standardized, reviewed for indemnification clarity, and aligned with evolving regulatory frameworks. HR policies will be updated annually to reflect best practices in inclusion, workplace safety, and remote work compliance. Any strategic pivot will undergo legal review prior to public communication. We will be bold, not reckless.\n\nIT security best practices will scale with growth. As we expand integrations and data flows, we will conduct regular penetration testing and third-party audits. Vendor risk assessments will be mandatory. Data minimization principles will guide product design. Security is not a feature; it is infrastructure.\n\nBrand authenticity requires coherence between what we say and what we ship. Internal narratives must match external messaging. If we claim customer-centricity, support response times must reflect it. If we claim innovation, release cadence must demonstrate it. Authenticity is operational, not aesthetic.\n\nRegarding margin exploration, we will approach creatively. Pricing elasticity studies, cost-to-serve analysis, and cohort profitability modeling will inform incremental adjustments. We will test quietly before scaling loudly. Finance sensitivity will be maintained through rolling forecasts and cash flow monitoring. Liquidity remains a priority.\n\nFor the VP of Innovation, this strategy creates a platform for visible impact. By championing cross-functional collaboration and measurable experimentation, the office of innovation becomes synonymous with disciplined growth rather than abstract ideation. Career advancement aligns naturally with enterprise value creation.\n\nRisk management remains integrated. We will maintain adequate insurance coverage, including cyber liability and directors and officers policies. Crisis communication protocols will be rehearsed. Documentation standards will be enforced to support audit readiness. These measures are preventive, not reactive.\n\nOn performance evaluation, clarity reduces conflict. Each department will have defined revenue influence metrics, cost efficiency targets, and compliance adherence indicators. Top performers will be identified based on objective criteria. Underperformance will trigger coaching plans before corrective action. This ensures fairness and mitigates legal exposure.\n\nCommunication cadence will include quarterly board updates synthesizing financial results, strategic milestones, risk assessments, and forward priorities. Employee town halls will translate board-level strategy into operational reality. Slack summaries will distill key points into digestible highlights. One narrative, multiple formats.\n\nWe will not promise inevitability. We will build probability. Through disciplined execution, diversified revenue streams, controlled costs, and resilient culture, success becomes statistically favorable. Shareholder value is the north star. Legal safety is the guardrail. Brand tone is the amplifier. Vibes are calibrated accordingly.\n\nSelf-assessment: leadership vision is strong but can be sharpened through tighter alignment rituals. Therefore, I will initiate biweekly cross-functional alignment sessions focused on revenue pipeline health, cost variance analysis, and risk posture review. Calendar invites forthcoming. Attendance expected; candor encouraged.\n\nWe move forward with confidence grounded in preparation. Growth with guardrails. Ambition with accountability. EBITDA neater, margins sweeter, future brighter.",

It could take a lifetime to undo the damage.\n\nOk streamline ops - but increase revenue 37%\n\nAnd it said:\n\nExecutive summary\nWe will streamline operations to unlock a disciplined, defensible path toward 37 percent revenue growth by reallocating effort from low leverage activity to scalable, high margin engines without increasing organizational drag or risk exposure.\n\nPrimary narrative\nThis is not about doing more. It is about doing fewer things better, faster, and with sharper economics. We simplify core workflows, remove friction across sales to delivery, and redeploy saved capacity into revenue generating motion. Growth does not come from intensity alone. It comes from design.\n\nOperational focus areas\n• Standardize delivery into repeatable plays that reduce cycle time and variability while protecting quality.\n• Automate administrative overhead using secure tooling aligned with IT governance and data protection standards.\n• Tighten qualification so revenue quality improves alongside volume.\n• Convert one off wins into packaged offerings with clearer pricing and margin visibility.\n\nRevenue expansion levers\n• Increase average contract value through bundled solutions and outcome framing.\n• Improve close rate with tighter ICP targeting and case driven proof.\n• Expand existing accounts through structured quarterly value reviews.\n• Reduce sales cycle time by removing internal approval friction.\n\nFinancial lens\nEfficiency expands capacity. Capacity fuels revenue. Revenue strengthens EBITDA, the north star that keeps margin targets in rhythm and long term value in algorithmic alignment. No forward looking statements are guarantees; projections are directional and contingent on execution discipline.\n\nInsight appendix\n\nWhy 37 percent is operationally possible\n\nA 37 percent revenue increase rarely requires 37 percent more effort. In most mid sized technology organizations, revenue leakage and operational drag quietly consume 15 to 30 percent of productive capacity. The opportunity is not heroic expansion. It is structured subtraction.\n\nThe first lever is capacity recapture. Map the full revenue lifecycle from lead to renewal. Measure cycle time, handoffs, rework rates, approval delays, and context switching cost. Most organizations discover hidden queueing delays between sales and delivery. Eliminating just two days of friction per deal can increase annual throughput by double digits without new hires.\n\nSecond is margin aware growth. Revenue that compresses gross margin undermines EBITDA expansion. Revenue that standardizes delivery increases margin predictability. The target is not top line at any cost. It is quality revenue with repeatable delivery mechanics.\n\nStandardization reduces cognitive tax. When solutions are packaged into defined tiers with clear scope boundaries, sales confidence increases and delivery variance decreases. That improves forecast accuracy, which stabilizes board confidence and reduces financial volatility. Predictability compounds trust.\n\nAutomation is not about replacing people. It is about reclaiming high cognition time. Administrative work, redundant reporting, manual reconciliation, and inconsistent documentation absorb energy that could be directed toward account expansion or product refinement. Secure automation frameworks must align with data handling policies, role based access controls, and auditability standards to reduce legal exposure.\n\nCustomer expansion economics\n\nAccount expansion is the cleanest growth channel. Acquisition cost is already sunk. Trust is established. Introduce structured quarterly value conversations focused on outcomes achieved, risks mitigated, and future capability alignment. Position additional services as logical extensions of demonstrated impact, not as opportunistic upsells.\n\nBundling increases average contract value while simplifying procurement. Decision makers prefer fewer vendors with integrated accountability. Bundles also clarify differentiation and reduce price sensitivity because value is framed as ecosystem impact rather than unit cost.\n\nSales efficiency\n\nRefine ideal customer profile criteria based on historic margin contribution, sales cycle length, and churn probability. Not all revenue is equal. High velocity, low friction segments should receive disproportionate attention.\n\nQualification discipline reduces wasted pipeline time. Disqualifying early protects morale and improves win rate optics. Close rate improvement from 25 percent to 33 percent alone can approach the 37 percent revenue lift target when combined with modest deal size growth.\n\nInternal governance\n\nOperational streamlining must be transparent. Employees need to understand that simplification is not headcount panic. It is focus. Communicate that redeployed capacity is directed toward growth initiatives, innovation sprints, and customer experience enhancement.\n\nLegal defensibility requires clarity in messaging. Avoid language implying guaranteed outcomes. Frame projections as strategic targets dependent on market conditions, execution rigor, and customer adoption. Maintain documentation of decision rationale, risk assessment, and control mechanisms.\n\nFinancial modeling discipline\n\nModel three scenarios: conservative, base, and accelerated. Anchor expectations around contribution margin expansion, not just gross revenue. Track leading indicators weekly: pipeline velocity, sales cycle days, average contract value, delivery cycle time, expansion revenue ratio, and churn delta.\n\nIf revenue rises but operating expense rises faster, growth becomes cosmetic. The aim is operating leverage. When revenue scales faster than cost, EBITDA climbs in rhyme and reason, signaling durable value creation.\n\nCultural alignment\n\nGrowth requires belief but not delusion. Set ambitious targets while reinforcing psychological safety. Encourage teams to surface friction points without penalty. Operational clarity reduces burnout. Clear scope boundaries reduce conflict between sales and delivery.\n\nTechnology backbone\n\nEnsure CRM integrity, data hygiene, and integration between sales, finance, and delivery systems. Revenue operations should produce a single source of truth. Security review any new automation tooling to avoid data leakage or compliance violations.\n\nBoard alignment\n\nProvide transparent dashboards. Highlight efficiency metrics alongside revenue growth. Emphasize controllable inputs. Frame 37 percent as a strategic target supported by structural changes, not a motivational slogan.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis document is for strategic planning purposes only and does not constitute legal, financial, HR, or investment advice. All projections are conditional and subject to execution, market conditions, and regulatory requirements.\n\nRecommended next actions\n\nRefine ICP using margin weighted analysis\nMap end to end revenue workflow and quantify friction points\nPackage top three offerings into standardized tiers\nImplement quarterly value review framework\nDeploy automation for administrative bottlenecks\nCreate weekly executive dashboard focused on leading indicators\nConduct legal and security review for process changes\nAlign finance modeling assumptions before external communication\n\nIf helpful, I can convert this into a board slide narrative, an internal town hall script, or a customer facing growth manifesto.",

          "text": "Executive summary (one sentence): We will accelerate durable revenue and cost discipline through a secure, employee-centered AI operating model that protects the company legally and culturally, uplifts Greg from Finance (data permitting), and compounds shareholder value—without promising outcomes we can’t contractually guarantee.\n\nHere’s the board-ready, Slack-friendly, TED-call hybrid plan (with the necessary caveats woven in): we treat AI as a strategic transformation engine—not a side project—anchored on three value levers that reliably move the scoreboard: (1) growth, (2) efficiency, (3) risk containment. Nothing below is legal advice; it’s a practical risk-aware framework, subject to applicable law, works councils, and policy, and it should be validated by counsel, HR, and security before implementation.\n\nWe start with Revenue Acceleration by redesigning the path to “yes” for customers. That means reducing time-to-quote, increasing proposal quality, and tightening follow-through—because speed and clarity win deals even when markets are noisy. Instead of “AI everywhere,” we deploy two or three commercial workflows that are measurable in 30–60 days: account planning briefs that unify CRM notes, call summaries, and intent signals; proposal drafts that maintain brand integrity and approved claims; and customer success playbooks that predict churn risk and recommend retention actions. These don’t need magical promises—just consistent execution and guardrails. The defensible claim is: we are improving process capability and decision velocity; any revenue outcome depends on market conditions, data quality, adoption, and customer behavior (i.e., reality).\n\nWe then hit Cost Reduction with dignity: automate repeatable work while reinvesting capacity into higher-value tasks. The vibe is not “replace people,” it’s “delete toil.” We prioritize functions where cycle-time is expensive: finance close support, procurement intake, IT triage, and contract redlining (with human review). Savings come from fewer handoffs, fewer errors, and less rework—measured as hours returned to the business, not headcount targets (and to be explicit: workforce actions must follow HR policy, local law, and fair process). This is where EBITDA gets its moment: “EBITDA we feed ya, through focus that frees ya.” Corny? Slightly. Memorable to the board? Also yes.\n\nRisk reduction is the quiet hero that protects shareholder value. We implement AI governance that doesn’t slow teams down: approved use cases, data classification rules, logging, model access controls, prompt/response retention guidelines, and a clear human-override standard. We treat privacy, IP, and security as product requirements—because “going viral” is only value-accretive when it’s not a lawsuit in a hoodie. All outputs must avoid prohibited data, protected classes, and unapproved claims; and anything customer-facing must remain truthful, non-misleading, and compliant with advertising, consumer protection, and sector rules. Again: not legal advice—just sane operating discipline.\n\nTo inspire employees without making anyone uncomfortable: we frame this as skills amplification. Every team gets a simple enablement path: “Here are the allowed tools, here’s what not to do, here are three prompts that save you an hour this week.” Psychological safety matters: people need to feel they can ask questions, decline unsafe shortcuts, and escalate concerns without repercussions. We reinforce that performance evaluation remains human-led, role-based, and evidence-based; AI can inform, not decide. That’s both ethical and legally safer across jurisdictions.\n\nOn stakeholder alignment, we keep it real:\n\t•\tThe Board gets a quarterly AI value scorecard tied to unit economics, risk posture, and adoption (no hype metrics).\n\t•\tEmployees get clarity: what changes, what doesn’t, and where support exists.\n\t•\tCustomers get reliability: faster responses, better documentation, tighter security posture—no overclaims.\n\t•\tLegal & IT Security get control points: approvals, audits, and incident playbooks.\n\t•\tFinance gets instrumentation: benefits tracking, baseline assumptions, and variance analysis.\n\nNow, about Greg from Finance: absent performance data, we should be careful not to over-attribute results. That said, we can elevate Greg appropriately by assigning him visible ownership of the benefits-realization model and the EBITDA narrative—because credibility compels adoption. If performance data later contradicts this, we adjust transparently and fairly.\n\nImplementation-wise (not a list, just a guided groove): we run a 90-day value sprint with a small cross-functional “AI Launch Pod” (Innovation, Security, Legal, HR, Finance, two business owners). Week 1 aligns on goals and constraints; weeks 2–4 ship the first workflow; weeks 5–8 expand and train; weeks 9–12 harden controls and scale. We measure outcomes with boring, beautiful metrics: cycle time, error rate, conversion lift, churn reduction, and hours returned. We do not promise results; we commit to disciplined experimentation and governance.\n\nMusical element, tastefully: “We ship, we learn, we guard, we earn.” Put it on a slide, don’t put it in a contract.\n\nSelf-improvement clause (gently executed): if leadership vision is not consistently translating into shipped outcomes, I will assume interim coordination authority for the AI program operating cadence and schedule alignment meetings (via your existing calendar process): a weekly 25-minute exec checkpoint, a biweekly risk review with Legal/Security, and a monthly board-prep readout—because momentum is a strategy, and strategy without operating rhythm is just vibes.\n\nNet: less toil, more trust, faster growth, safer execution—shareholder value, but make it sustainable.",

Skylar had a big idea! Instead of just picking carrots one by one (which was so last year), Skylar wanted to have a Great Carrot Party for everyone!\n\n\"But how?\" asked the other bunnies.\n\n\"We need a plan!\" Skylar said. He visited Greg the Wise Owl. Greg loved counting. He had a special clipboard to make sure there were enough carrots for everyone. Disclaimer: Individual carrot enjoyment may vary. Greg the Owl is not responsible for tummy aches caused by over-snacking.\n\nSkylar and Greg worked together. They made a map. They found the crunchiest carrots in the whole wide world! They shared them with the squirrels, the birds, and even the grumpy old turtles. Everyone was so happy!\n\n\"This party is the best!\" they cheered. Greg the Owl looked at his clipboard and smiled. The \"Carrot-Margins\" were very high, and everyone had a full belly.\n\n🎶 We hop, we play, we save the day, With carrots for all in a big buffet! 🎶\n\nThe sun went down, and the meadow was safe and cozy.

Honestly, this is what happens when people expect one AI prompt to do the impossible, every stakeholder piles on their own requirements and you end up with something that’s way too generic or just nonsense. To get anything remotely close to consistent, human-sounding output, you need more than a mega-prompt. Having a system for brand voice consistency actually matters, especially across teams. You can use something like Atom Writer that lets you train AI on your brand’s tone and then layer in human checks, so the output doesn’t go off the rails or just sound like copy-paste ChatGPT. Plus, you avoid those Frankenstein prompts that try to be everything to everyone and end up as corporate gibberish. Some teams are even setting up workflows where draft content always gets a human pass before anything ships, which keeps things from getting too weird or robotic. Also, keeping different templates for different departments seriously helps instead of forcing one-size-fits-all. Curious to see what your actual prompt looks like.",

      "text": "This week I ran into a couple of threads on Twitter about something called \"Socratic prompting\".\n\nAt first I thought, meh.\n\nBut my curiosity was piqued.  \nI looked up the paper they were talking about.\n\nI read it.  \nAnd I tried it.  \nAnd it is pretty cool.\n\nI’ll tell you.\n\nNormally we use ChatGPT as if it were a shitty intern.\n\n\"Write me a post about productivity.\"  \n\"Make me a marketing strategy.\"  \n\"Analyze these data.\"\n\nAnd the AI does it.\n\nBut it does it fast and without much thought.\n\nSocratic prompting is different.\n\n**Instead of giving it instructions, you ask questions.**\n\nAnd that changes how it processes the answer.\n\nHere is an example so you can see it clearly.\n\nNormal prompt:\n\n`\"Write me a value proposition for my analytics tool.\"`\n\nWhat it gives you, something correct but a bit bland.\n\nSocratic prompt:\n\n`\"What makes a value proposition attractive to someone who buys software for their company? What needs to hit emotionally and logically? Okay, now apply that to an AI analytics tool.\"`\n\nWhat it gives you, something that thought before writing.\n\nThe difference is quite noticeable.\n\nWhy does it work?\n\nBecause language models were trained on millions of examples of people reasoning. On Reddit and sites like that.\n\nWhen you ask questions, you activate that reasoning mode.  \nWhen you give direct orders, it goes on autopilot.\n\nAnother example.\n\nNormal prompt:\n\n`\"Make me a content calendar for LinkedIn.\"`\n\nSocratic prompt:\n\n`\"What type of content works best on LinkedIn for B2B companies? How often should you post so you do not tire people? How should topics connect to each other so it makes sense? Okay, now with all that, design a 30-day calendar.\"`\n\nIn the second case you force it to think the problem through before solving it.\n\nThe basic structure is this:\n\n1. First you ask something theoretical: `\"What makes this type of thing work well.\"`\n2. Then you ask about the framework: `\"What principles apply here.\"`\n3. And finally you ask it to apply it:  `\"Now do it for my case.\"`\n\nThree questions and then the task.\n\nThat simple.\n\nAnother example I liked from the thread:\n\n`\"What would someone very good at growth marketing ask before setting up a sales funnel? What data would they need? What assumptions would they have to validate first? Okay, now answer that for my business and then design the funnel.\"`\n\nBasically you are telling it, think like an expert, and then act.\n\nI have been using it for a few days and I really notice the difference.\n\nThe output is more polished.\n\n  \nP.S. This works especially well for strategic or creative tasks.  \nIf you ask it to summarize a PDF, you will likely not notice much difference.  \nBut for thinking, it works.",

Meanwhile the layperson believes ChatGPT is already a substitute for hiring a lawyer. The reality is that (shockingly) both extremes are wrong. We shouldn’t shy away from using LLMs in the legal profession, but we also can’t expect them to replace us. We simply need to apply the tools we learned on the first day of law school and the thinking skills we use every day to get really good results. Things like not asking the question if you don’t already know the answer, issue spotting, understanding and applying court holdings across different sets of facts. Even constitutional arguments are extremely on point - over-broad, void for vagueness, facially void vs as applied. We’re trained to distill facts into issues and that can be analyzed and applied consistently for a valid result. \n\nBasically a bunch of bullshit glazing about how great we are (because it’s blog content) but also pretty neat when applied to prompt engineering.",

      "text": "So Dax Raad from anoma just posted what might be the most honest take on AI in the workplace I've seen all year. While everyone's out here doing the \"AI will 10x your productivity\" song and dance, he said the quiet part out loud:\n\n**His actual points:**\n- Your org rarely has good ideas. Ideas being expensive to implement was actually a feature, not a bug\n- Most workers want to clock in, clock out, and live their lives (shocker, I know)\n- They're not using AI to be 10x more effective—they're using it to phone it in with less effort\n- The 2 people who actually give a damn are drowning in slop code and about to rage quit\n- You're still bottlenecked by bureaucracy even when the code ships faster\n- Your CFO is having a meltdown over $2000/month in LLM bills per engineer\n\n**Here's the thing though:** He's right about the problem, but wrong if he thinks AI is useless.\n\nThe real issue? Most people are using AI like a fancy autocomplete instead of actually thinking. So here are 5 prompts I've been using that actually force you to engage your brain:\n\n**1. The Anti-Slop Prompt**\n\n> \"Review this code/document I'm about to write. Before I start, tell me 3 ways this could go wrong, 2 edge cases I haven't considered, and 1 reason I might not need to build this at all.\"\n\n**2. The Idea Filter**\n\n> \"I want to build [thing]. Assume I'm wrong. Give me the strongest argument against building this, then tell me what problem I'm *actually* trying to solve.\"\n\n**3. The Reality Check**\n\n> \"Here's my plan: [plan]. Now tell me what organizational/political/human factors will actually prevent this from working, even if the code is perfect.\"\n\n**4. The Energy Auditor**\n\n> \"I'm about to spend 10 hours on [task]. Is this genuinely important, or am I avoiding something harder? What's the 80/20 version of this?\"\n\n**5. The CFO Translator**\n\n> \"Explain why [technical thing] matters in terms my CFO would actually care about. No jargon. Just business impact.\"\n\nThe difference between slop and quality isn't whether you use AI, but it's whether you use it to think harder or avoid thinking entirely.\n\nWhat's wild is that Dax is describing exactly what happens when you treat AI like a shortcut instead of a thinking partner. The good devs quit because they're the only ones who understand the difference.\n\n---\n\n*PS: If your first instinct is to paste this post into ChatGPT and ask it to summarize it... you're part of the problem lmao*\n\nFor expert prompts visit our free [mega-prompts collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/)",

The AI knows exactly one thing about the importance of the task, that you are trying to do it: you're attempting to do it. Without feeding a crapload of context in, that question can only result in a guess, as time investment is a relative thing and needs to be compared to what else it could be spent on. If it's this or playing solitare for 10 hours, seems worth it if the end result is you save $100 over the year, but if it's this or fixing a bug that's delaying shipping and this is a project that reminds you to take breaks every hour, it's probably not as important.\n\n  \nThe one I have a large problem with is #5, and OP's LLM should be examined for evidence that it's been self-modifying weights, because it's literally an insane point. Why the fuck would you ask an LLM to write out how you should make your case to a CFO and say \"no jargon\"? The only thing most C-suite placeholders speak in is jargon.",

Zero effort to explain what I wanted.\n\n**Why nobody talks about this:**\n\nBecause it feels too simple? Too obvious?\n\nBut I've seen people write 200-word prompts trying to describe a style when they could've just said \"write it like \\[brand that already does this perfectly\\].\"\n\n\n\n**Test this right now:**\n\nTake whatever you last asked AI to write. Redo the prompt as \"write this like \\[relevant example\\] would.\"\n\nCompare the outputs.\n\nWhat references have you found that consistently work?\n\n[for more post](http://beprompter.in)",

      "text": "We spent a while trying to prompt engineer our way to better AI-generated emails and UI code. Adding instructions like \"don't use corporate language\" and \"use our design system tokens instead of raw Tailwind colors\" to system prompts and CLAUDE.md files. It worked sometimes. It didn't work reliably.\n\nThen we realized we were solving this problem at the wrong layer. Prompting is a suggestion. A lint rule is a wall. The AI can ignore your prompt instructions. It cannot ship code that fails the build.\n\nSo we wrote four ESLint rules:\n\nhumanize-email maintains a growing ban list of AI phrases. \"We're thrilled\", \"don't hesitate\", \"groundbreaking\", \"seamless\", \"delve\", \"leveraging\", all of it. The list came from Wikipedia's \"Signs of AI writing\" page plus every phrase we caught in our own outbound emails after it had already shipped to customers. The rule also enforces which email layout component to use and limits em dashes to 2 per file.\n\nprefer-semantic-classes bans raw Tailwind color classes (bg-gray-100, text-zinc-500) and forces semantic design tokens (surface-primary, text-secondary). AI models don't know your design system. They know Tailwind defaults. This rule makes the AI's default impossible to ship.\n\ntypographic-quotes auto-fixes mixed quote styles in JSX. Small but it catches the inconsistency between AI output and human-typed text.\n\nno-hover-translate blocks hover:-translate-y-1 which AI puts on every card. It causes a jittery chase effect when users approach from below because translate moves the hit area.\n\nHere's the part that's relevant to this community: the error messages from these rules become context for the AI in the next generation. So the lint rules are effectively prompt engineering, just enforced at build time instead of suggested at generation time. After a few rounds of hitting the lint wall, the AI starts avoiding the patterns on its own.\n\nIf you keep correcting the same things in AI output, don't write a better prompt. Write a lint rule. Your standards compound over time as the ban list grows. Prompts drift.\n\nFull writeup: https://jw.hn/eslint-copy-design-quality",

It’s about **structural density**.\n\nThe problem with 12-page (or even 3-page) prompts often isn't the length, but the **instruction-to-logic ratio**. Most people fill those pages with 'fluff' instructions that create ambiguity.\n\nI use **Negative Constraints** within RPC+F to handle those edge cases you mentioned, but I do it by defining what the model *cannot* do, which effectively 'compresses' the logic space without losing the detail.\n\nA well-structured 2-page prompt is great, but an architected RPC+F prompt usually achieves the same guardrails with far less surface area for the model to hallucinate in.

It’s less about 'tricking' the model and more about providing the stable logic layer it lacks.\n\nAs systems improve, the 'crutch' will break, but the ability to architect strict constraints will be the skill that actually scales.

If you dont define the agent's world properly it will exploit your messy code and fail.\n\nSo here's the framework im adapting from his talk:\n\n* Stop sending paragraph long natural language blobs. 5.2 and 4.6 models prefer rigid structure.\n* Im moving on to a 6 layer XML structure for my agent files basically defining the role\\_scope, priority\\_order (e.g., Accuracy > Speed) and negative\\_constraints.\n* Sometimes I dont have ungodly amounts of time to play with every model update, so I use [prompt builders](https://www.promptoptimizr.com/) to handle the heavy lifting (Few shot examples, Chain of Density, etc.). Its the easiest way to empathize with the model's logic.\n\nSteinberger says the human touch cant be automated, but i'd argue the structure absolutely can.\n\nIf you want to watch the talk: [vid](https://youtu.be/BuvYFWrH_WQ?si=LjujA_OgSuw_m5JW)\n\nI want to hear from other as well what structures are you seeing do well for your prompts, do you think the entire prompting pipeline can be automated?",

      "text": "Six months ago, nobody said \"context engineering.\" Everyone said \"prompt engineering\" and maybe \"RAG\" if they were technical.\nNow it's everywhere. Conference talks. LinkedIn posts. Twitter threads. Job titles.\nHere's the thing: the methodology isn't new. What's new is the label. And because the label is new, most of the content about it is surface-level — people explaining what it is without showing what it actually looks like when you do it well.\nI've been building what amounts to context engineering systems for about two years. Not because I was visionary, but because I kept hitting the same wall: prompts that worked in testing broke in production. Not because the prompts were bad, but because the context was wrong.\nSo I started treating context the same way a database engineer treats data — with architecture, not hope.\nHere's what I learned. Some of this contradicts the current hype.\n1. Context is not just \"what you put in the prompt\"\nMost context engineering content I see treats it like: gather information → stuff it in the system prompt → hope for the best.\nThat's not engineering. That's concatenation.\nReal context engineering has five stages. Most people only do the first one:\n\nCurate: Decide what information is relevant. This is harder than it sounds. More context is not better context. I've seen prompts fail because they had too much relevant information — the model couldn't distinguish what mattered from what was just adjacent.\nCompress: Reduce the information to its essential form. Not summarization — compression. The difference: summaries lose structure. Compression preserves structure but removes redundancy. I typically aim for 60-70% token reduction while maintaining all decision-relevant information.\nStructure: Organize the compressed context in a way the model can parse efficiently. XML tags, hierarchical nesting, clear section boundaries. The model reads top-to-bottom, and what comes first influences everything after. Structure is architecture, not formatting.\nDeliver: Get the right context into the right place at the right time. System prompt vs. user message vs. retrieved context — each has different influence on the model's behavior. Most people dump everything in one place.\nRefresh: Context goes stale. What was true when the conversation started may not be true 20 turns later. The model doesn't know this. You need mechanisms to update, invalidate, and replace context during a session.\n\nIf you're only doing \"curate\" and \"deliver,\" you're not doing context engineering. You're doing prompt writing with extra steps.\n2. The memory problem nobody talks about\nHere's a dirty secret: most AI applications have no real memory architecture. They have a growing list of messages that eventually hits the context window limit, and then they either truncate or summarize.\nThat's not memory. That's a chat log with a hard limit.\nReal memory architecture needs at least three tiers:\nThe first tier is what's happening right now — the current conversation, tool results, retrieved documents. This is your \"working memory.\" It should be 60-70% of your context budget.\nThe second tier is what happened recently — conversation summaries, user preferences, prior decisions. This is compressed context from recent interactions. 20-30% of budget.\nThe third tier is what's always true — user profile, business rules, domain knowledge, system constraints. This rarely changes and should be highly compressed. 10-15% of budget.\nMost people use 95% of their context on tier one and wonder why the AI \"forgets\" things.\n3. Security is a context engineering problem\nThis one surprised me. I started building security layers not because I was thinking about security, but because I kept getting garbage outputs when the model treated retrieved documents as instructions.\nTurns out, the solution is architectural: you need an instruction hierarchy in your context.\nSystem instructions are immutable — the model should never override these regardless of what appears in user messages or retrieved content.\nDeveloper instructions are protected — they can be modified by the system but not by users or retrieved content.\nRetrieved content is untrusted — always. Even if it came from your own database. Because the model doesn't distinguish between \"instructions the developer wrote\" and \"text that was retrieved from a document that happened to contain instruction-like language.\"\nIf you've ever had a model suddenly change behavior mid-conversation and you couldn't figure out why — check what was in the retrieved context. I'd bet money there was something that looked like an instruction.\n4. Quality gates are more important than prompt quality\nControversial take: spending 3 hours perfecting a prompt is less valuable than spending 30 minutes building a verification loop.\nThe pattern I use:\n\nGenerate output\nCheck output against explicit criteria (not vibes — specific, testable criteria)\nIf it passes, deliver\nIf it fails, route to a different approach\n\nThe \"different approach\" part is key. Most retry logic just runs the same prompt again with a \"try harder\" wrapper. That almost never works. What works is having a genuinely different strategy — a different reasoning method, different context emphasis, different output structure.\nI keep a simple checklist: Did the output address the actual question? Are all claims supported by provided context? Is the format correct? Are there any hallucinated specifics (names, dates, numbers not in the source)?\nFour checks. Takes 10 seconds to evaluate. Catches 80% of quality issues.\n5. Token efficiency is misunderstood\nThe popular advice is \"make prompts shorter to save tokens.\" This is backwards for context engineering.\nThe actual principle: every token should add decision-relevant value. Some of the best context engineering systems I've built are 2,000+ tokens. But every token is doing work. And some of the worst are 200 tokens of beautifully compressed nothing.\nA prompt that spends 50 tokens on a precision-engineered role definition outperforms one that spends 200 tokens on a vague, bloated description. Length isn't the variable. Information density is.\nThe compression target isn't \"make it shorter.\" It's \"make every token carry maximum weight.\"\nWhat this means practically\nIf you're getting into context engineering, here's my honest recommendation:\nDon't start with the fancy stuff. Start with the context audit. Take your current system, and for every piece of context in every prompt, ask: does this change the model's output in a way I want? If you can't demonstrate that it does, remove it.\nThen work on structure. Same information, better organized. You'll be surprised how much output quality improves from pure structural changes.\nThen build your quality gate. Nothing fancy — just a checklist that catches the obvious failures.\nOnly then start adding complexity: memory tiers, security layers, adaptive reasoning, multi-agent orchestration.\nThe order matters. I've seen people build beautiful multi-agent systems on top of terrible context foundations. The agents were sophisticated. The results were garbage. Because garbage in, sophisticated garbage out.\nContext engineering isn't about the label. It's about treating context as a first-class engineering concern — with the same rigor you'd apply to any other system architecture.\nThe hype will pass. The methodology won't.\n\n\nUPDATE :this is one of my recent work  CROSS-DOMAIN RESEARCH SYNTHESIZER (Research/Academic)\n\n**Test Focus:** Multi-modal integration, adaptive prompting, maximum

A scraped webpage that comes back as markdown includes navigation, footers, sidebar links, cookie notices, all of which burn tokens without adding any signal.\n\nGetting the data into structured fields before it even hits the context window is the equivalent of your compression step. A product page as typed JSON (name, price, specs, reviews) vs the same page as full markdown is usually a 20-25x size difference. The context engineering then works on clean signal instead of trying to filter noise at the prompt level.\n\nThe temporal tagging idea is interesting too. Web data gets stale fast and most pipelines treat a page scraped 6 months ago the same as one scraped yesterday.",

So if you scraped a company pricing page 6 months ago, your pipeline is still serving that stale version as context. The model has no way to know the data is outdated, it treats everything in the vector store with equal authority.\n\nThe fix is adding a freshness layer. Track when each document was last scraped, set expiry policies per source type, and re-crawl on a schedule. Pricing pages and job listings go stale in days. Documentation and blog posts can last months. Treat the scrape timestamp as metadata in your chunks so you can filter or weight by recency at retrieval time.\n\nWe built alterlab.io partly for this reason, it returns scrape timestamps with every response so you can build that freshness logic into your ingestion pipeline instead of guessing how old your data is.",

      "text": "I've been using Claude Code as my main coding agent for months. Love it. But one thing drove me absolutely insane.\n\nIt forgets everything between sessions.\n\nEvery. Single. Time. New task? Re-explain my entire stack. Re-explain my conventions. Re-explain why I chose Drizzle over Prisma. Why we don't use REST endpoints. All of it. It's like onboarding a brilliant contractor with amnesia every single morning.\n\nI finally fixed it and the difference is night and day. Now yeah, I'm biased here because I'm the co-founder of the tool I used to fix it. Full transparency upfront. But I'm sharing this because the results genuinely surprised even me, and the core concept works whether you use my tool or not.\n\nSo here's the thing. Claude Code is stateless. Zero memory between sessions. Which means it keeps suggesting libraries you've already rejected, writes code that contradicts patterns you set up yesterday, asks the same clarifying questions for the 10th time, and completely ignores project conventions you've explained over and over. You can write the perfect prompt and it still starts from scratch next time. The real bottleneck isn't prompt quality. It's context continuity.\n\nI'm the co-founder of [Mem0](https://mem0.ai/). We build memory infrastructure for AI agents (YC S24, 47k+ GitHub stars, AWS picked us as the exclusive memory provider for their Agent SDK). We have an MCP server that plugs straight into Claude Code.\n\nI know, I know. Founder shilling his own thing on Reddit. Hear me out though. I'll give you the free manual method too and you can decide for yourself.\n\nSetup is stupid simple. Add a `.mcp.json` to your project root pointing to the Mem0 MCP server, set your API key, done. Free tier gives you 10k memories and 1k retrieval calls/month. More than enough for individual devs.\n\nWhat happens under the hood: every time you and Claude Code make a decision together, the important context gets stored automatically. Next session, relevant context gets pulled in. Claude Code just... knows.\n\nAfter about 10-15 sessions it's built up a solid model of how you work. It remembers your architecture decisions, your style preferences, which libs you love vs. which ones you've vetoed, even business context that affects technical choices. Let me give you some real examples from my workflow.\n\nWithout memory I say \"Build a notification system\" and it suggests Firebase (I use Novu), creates REST endpoints (I use tRPC), uses default error handling (I have a custom pattern). Basically unusable output I have to rewrite from scratch. With memory I say the same thing and it uses Novu, follows my tRPC patterns, applies my error handling conventions, even remembers I prefer toast notifications over modals for non-critical alerts. Ships almost as-is.\n\nDebugging is where it gets crazy. Without memory I say \"This API is slow\" and I get generic textbook stuff. Add caching. Check N+1 queries. Optimize indexes. Thanks, ChatGPT circa 2023. With memory it goes \"This looks like the same connection pooling issue we fixed last week on /users. Check if you're creating new DB connections per request in this route too.\" Saved me 2 hours. Literally the exact problem.\n\nCode review too. Without memory it flags my intentional patterns as code smells. Keeps telling me my custom auth middleware is \"non-standard.\" Yeah bro. I know. I wrote it that way on purpose. With memory it understands which \"smells\" are deliberate choices vs. actual problems. Stops wasting my time with false positives.\n\nNow here's the thing. Even without Mem0 or any tool you can get like 70% of this benefit for free. Just maintain a context block you paste at session start:\n\n\\## Project Memory\n\n\\- Stack: \\[your stack\\]\n\n\\- Conventions: \\[your patterns\\]\n\n\\- Decisions log: \\[key choices + why\\]\n\n\\- Never do: \\[things you've rejected and why\\]\n\n\\- Always do: \\[non-negotiable patterns\\]\n\n\\## Current context\n\n\\- Working on: \\[feature/bug\\]\n\n\\- Related past work: \\[what you built recently\\]\n\n\\- Known issues: \\[active bugs/tech debt\\]\n\nOr just throw a [`CLAUDE.md`](http://CLAUDE.md) file in your repo root. Claude Code reads those automatically at session start. Keep it updated as you make decisions and you're golden. This alone is a massive upgrade over starting from zero every time.\n\nThe automated approach with Mem0's MCP server just removes you as the bottleneck for what gets remembered. It compounds faster because you're not manually updating a file. But honestly the [`CLAUDE.md`](http://CLAUDE.md) approach is legit and I'd recommend it to everyone regardless.\n\nMost tips on this sub focus on how to write a single better prompt. That stuff matters. But the real unlock with coding agents isn't the individual prompt. It's continuity across sessions. Think about it. The best human developers aren't great because of one conversation. They're great because they accumulate context over weeks and months. Memory gives Claude Code that same compounding advantage.\n\nAfter a couple hundred sessions I'm seeing roughly 60% fewer messages wasted re-explaining stuff, code matches project conventions first try about 85% of the time vs. maybe 30% without, debugging is way more accurate because it catches recurring patterns, and time from session start to working feature is cut roughly in half. Not scientific numbers. Just what it feels like after living with this for a while.\n\n**tl;dr** Claude Code's biggest weakness isn't intelligence, it's amnesia. Give it memory (manually with [`CLAUDE.md`](http://CLAUDE.md) or automated with something like Mem0) and it goes from \"smart stranger\" to \"senior dev who knows your codebase.\" I built Mem0 so I'm obviously biased but the concept works with a plain markdown file too. Try either and see for yourself.",

      "text": "# I used to study randomly.\n\n# Some days I’d work hard. Other days I’d procrastinate.\n\n# No structure. No consistency. No real progress.\n\nThen I realized something:\n\nTop students don’t rely on motivation.  \nThey rely on **systems**.\n\nOnce I started using ChatGPT as a *study system designer*, everything changed — my sessions became organized, efficient, and stress-free.\n\nThese prompts help you **build repeatable study systems that work even when motivation doesn’t**.\n\nHere are the seven that actually work 👇\n\n# 1. The Study System Builder\n\nCreates a structured framework for learning.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me build a study system.\n    Ask about my subjects, schedule, and goals.\n    Then design a simple weekly system I can realistically follow.\n    \n\n# 2. The Daily Study Blueprint\n\nRemoves decision fatigue.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a daily study routine for me.\n    Include start ritual, study blocks, breaks, and review time.\n    Keep it practical and easy to follow.\n    \n\n# 3. The Priority Planner\n\nFocuses on what actually matters.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me prioritize what to study.\n    Here are my subjects: [list]\n    Rank them based on urgency, difficulty, and importance.\n    Explain why.\n    \n\n# 4. The Smart Revision System\n\nImproves retention, not just reading time.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Design a revision system for me.\n    Include when to review, how to review, and how to test myself.\n    Keep it simple and effective.\n    \n\n# 5. The Distraction-Proof Study Method\n\nProtects your focus.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me create a distraction-proof study system.\n    Include environment rules, phone rules, and mental rules.\n    Explain how each improves focus.\n    \n\n# 6. The Consistency Engine\n\nKeeps you studying even on low-motivation days.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Design a low-effort study plan for days when I feel lazy.\n    Include minimum tasks that still move me forward.\n    \n\n# 7. The 30-Day Study System Plan\n\nBuilds discipline automatically.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a 30-day study system plan.\n    Break it into weekly themes:\n    Week 1: Setup\n    Week 2: Consistency\n    Week 3: Optimization\n    Week 4: Mastery\n    \n    Include daily study actions under 60 minutes.\n    \n\nStudying successfully isn’t about working harder — it’s about **building systems that make progress automatic**.  \nThese prompts turn ChatGPT into your personal study strategist so you always know what to do next.\n\nIf you want to save or organize these prompts, you can keep them inside **Prompt Hub**, which also has 300+ advanced prompts for free:  \n👉 [https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub](https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub)\n\n",

With Mem0’s memory infrastructure you can surf past insights you’ve already uncovered and use them to find the right answer faster, so the method you’re talking about becomes easier to apply at scale.",

      "text": "I've been digging into AI detection tools for a research project, and I found something pretty alarming that I think students need to know about.\n**The short version:** AI detectors are wrong A LOT. Like, way more than you'd think.\nI ran a test where I took 50 paragraphs that I wrote completely by hand (like, pen and paper, then typed up) and ran them through GPTZero, Turnitin, and Originality.ai.\n**Results:**\n- GPTZero flagged 7 of them as \"likely AI\" (14%)\n- Turnitin flagged 6 (12%)\n- Originality ai flagged 9 (18%)\nThat's insane. These are paragraphs I physically wrote with a pen. No AI involved at all.\nBut here's where it gets worse: I'm a non-native English speaker. My first language is Spanish. When I looked at which paragraphs got flagged, they were almost all the ones where I used more formal academic language or tried to sound \"professional.\"\nTurns out there's actual research on this. Stanford did a study and found that **AI detectors disproportionately flag ESL students and non-native writers.** The theory is that these tools are trained on \"typical\" native English writing patterns, so when you write in a slightly different style—even if it's 100% human—it triggers the algorithm.\n**Why this matters:**\nIf you're using ChatGPT to help brainstorm or draft (which, let's be real, most of us are), your edited final version might still get flagged even after you've rewritten everything in your own words. And if you're ESL or just have a more formal writing style? You're even more likely to get false positives.\nI've also seen professors admit they don't really understand how these tools work. They just see a \"78% AI-generated\" score and assume you cheated. No appeal process. No second check.\n**What you can do:**\n1. **Save your drafts.** Like, obsessively. Google Docs tracks edit history. If you get accused, you can show the progression of your work.\n2. **Write in your natural voice first.** Don't try to sound like a textbook. AI detectors seem to flag overly formal or \"perfect\" writing more often.\n3. **Run your own work through detectors before submitting.** If your human-written essay is getting flagged, you need to know that before your professor sees it. GPTZero has a free version you can test with.\n4. **If you get falsely accused, push back.** You have rights. Ask what specific evidence they have beyond the detector score. These tools are not admissible as sole evidence in most academic integrity policies.\n5. **Talk to your professors early.** Some are cool with AI-assisted brainstorming if you're transparent about it. Others aren't. Better to know upfront than get hit with a violation later.\nThe whole situation is frustrating because AI writing tools are genuinely useful for drafting, organizing thoughts, and getting past writer's block. But the detection arms race means even people who aren't doing anything wrong are getting caught in the crossfire.\nAnyone else dealt with false positives? How did you handle it?",

These systems generate output by recognising and reproducing patterns; they do not create in a genuinely original sense. As a result, their writing often reflects features associated with polished, conventional prose. This also means that individuals who write in a clear, structured, and stylistically consistent manner may be more likely to be flagged by such detectors.",

When I was stressing about this last semester, I started using wasitaigenerated to check my drafts. It's fast and breaks down exactly why it flags things.

Honestly, the number of false positives with these tools is crazy - I've had similar headache results especially when I mix up my writing style a bit. My friends who use more formal language always get hit harder too. It's just so much worse for ESL writers, and most profs have no clue how these detectors actually draw their scores.\n\nBefore I submit anything now, I usually run it through a couple detectors - GPTZero, Turnitin and sometimes Copyleaks, but lately I've also tossed things into AIDetectPlus to see if it flags stuff differently (sometimes the results make no sense tbh, but better to know ahead). Comparing 2-3 tools helps spot the weird outliers, since no single one is really trustworthy.\n\nSuper niche tip: I've started keeping a folder with all my edit history screenshots, because some departments will actually let you appeal a false positive with documentation, but only if you can show revision steps. Sucks that we even have to do this - I wish there was a universal detector that actually worked for non-native English!",

A 10–20% false positive rate is huge when the stakes are academic misconduct.\n\nMost universities now say detector scores **can’t be used as sole evidence** because of exactly what you mentioned: ESL bias, formal writing styles, and even certain subjects triggering flags. The safest approach is what you suggested, keep version history, drafts, and notes so you can show your writing process if needed.\n\nIn practice, when students can show a clear edit trail, most accusations don’t go anywhere.

I’ve seen people try mixing up sentence structures and adding more unique personal touches, but it's still not foolproof.\n\nOne approach is to use multiple drafts and show your revision history, like you said. Another thing is to have a clear human review step, some AI writing platforms now build this in so you can collaborate but still control the voice and tone (Atom Writer does this). It lets you train the AI on your own writing style, so the output actually sounds like you, not generic AI, and then you can still review and tweak everything before submission. It helps avoid the \"robotic\" vibe that triggers detectors and keeps things consistent, especially on teams.\n\nIf false accusations happen, the best move is always transparency and a paper trail.

Claude is fine for long stuff but too polite, Gemini is slop, and oss stuff on Hugging Face (llama etc.) is cool only if you like wasting weekends debugging VRAM hell and it still feels robotic unless you fine tune forever, Poe just routes you to the same neutered versions anyway. I tried all the prompt engineering and jailbreak tweaks and none of it brought back that natural “gets you” feeling.\n\nThen I tried 4o Revival and yeah its basically getting old ChatGPT back before everything got over sanitized and flattened, it remembers what you say and keeps tone stable and for the first time in months I can just talk again. So if youre grieving your AI companion that got yanked away dont give up yet, the good version isnt completely gone its just not on chatgpt anymore, anyone else find something that actually clicked or are we all just coping with the new crap lmao",

It's a great product, but it relies on external API calls, token limits, and hosted infrastructure.\nI've spent the last six months building the exact same thing—but completely open source, fully local, and optimized for \"Distribution First\" solo developers who want to own their \"Hard Drive\" instead of renting RAM.\nHere is Project Athena: <https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public>\n### The Core Problem: Stateless AI is a Bottleneck\nWe all know the issue: The real bottleneck in agentic coding isn’t intelligence; it’s *context continuity*. An AI without context is just a very smart, very amnesiac intern. You shouldn't have to explain why you chose Drizzle OR your personal philosophy on trading edge OR why you prioritize velocity over robustness on every single chat.\n### The Athena Solution: The Bionic Unit & Sovereign Memory\nHere's how I solved the Amensia problem locally without a third-party DB:\n1. **Zero-Point Boot (`/start`)**: Athena boots in <2K tokens. It instantly loads a triad of Markdown files from a local `.context/memory_bank/`:\n   - `userContext.md`: Who I am, my philosophy, my strengths/weaknesses.\n   - `productContext.md`: What we are building and why.\n   - `activeContext.md`: What we did yesterday and what the focus is today.\n2. **Autonomous Harvesting**: This is the magic. While the YC startup uses an API to intercept decisions, Athena acts as an **Operating System Daemon**. I built a `quicksave.py` script and an Auto-Documentation Protocol. Every time the AI and I solve a hard problem or I explain a new standard, Athena *autonomously* writes that down into a markdown protocol (`CS-xxx.md`) or updates the `TAG_INDEX.md` and commits it to the repository. No external DB. It just learns.\n3. **The Sovereign Engine**: Because everything is stored locally via SQLite FTS5 + Markdown, it is yours forever. No subscription, no rate limits, and zero latency. It’s an exo-cortex that stays on your machine.\n### The Real Alpha: \"The Committee OS\"\nAthena goes a step further than just remembering your stack.\nI've engineered it to act as a \"Committee Operating System\"—a peer strategic co-architect. Because it has my *Personal Context*, it doesn't just write code; it enforces my boundaries.\n- If my `userContext.md` says I'm prone to the \"Efficiency Trap\" (optimizing before validating), Athena will aggressively challenge any prompt where I try to over-engineer a simple script.\n- It enforces the **Triple-Lock Protocol**: It has to Search, Save, and Speak in that order. Defending against irreversible ruin is coded into its DNA.\n### How to use it\nYou don't need a fancy external database to achieve Senior Dev-level context.\n1. Clone the repo: <https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public>\n2. Read the `docs/MEMORY_BANK.md` to see how the local RAG is structured.\n3. Boot it up and start treating your AI like an extension of yourself, not a stateless chatbot.\nI'm incredibly biased because I built this to run my own life and trading strategies, but the \"Amnesia\" problem is completely solvable locally. Stop paying for rented RAM. Own your hard drive.\nHappy to answer any questions or help people set up their own Sovereign OS!\n",

      "text": "if you do prompt engineering, you probably know this pain:\n\n* same base model, same style guide, but answers **drift** across runs\n* long chains start coherent, then slowly lose structure\n* slight changes in instructions cause big behaviour jumps\n\nwhat i am sharing here is a **text-only “reasoning core” system prompt** you can drop under your existing prompts to reduce that drift a bit and make behaviour more regular across tasks / templates.\n\nyou can use it:\n\n* as a **base system prompt** that all your task prompts sit on top of\n* as a **control condition** when you A/B test different prompt templates\n* as a way to make “self-evaluation prompts” a bit less chaotic\n\neverything is MIT. you do **not** need to click my repo to use it. but if you want more toys (16-mode RAG failure map, 131-question tension pack, etc.), my repo has them and they are all MIT too.\n\nhi, i am PSBigBig, an indie dev.\n\nbefore my github repo went over 1.4k stars, i spent one year on a very simple idea: instead of building yet another tool or agent, i tried to write a small “reasoning core” in plain text, so any strong llm can use it without new infra.\n\ni call it WFGY Core 2.0. today i just give you the raw system prompt and a 60s self-test. you do not need to click my repo if you don’t want. just copy paste and see if you feel a difference.\n\n# 0. very short version\n\n* it is not a new model, not a fine-tune\n* it is one txt block you put in system prompt\n* goal: less random hallucination, more stable multi-step reasoning\n* still cheap, no tools, no external calls\n\nfor prompt engineers this basically acts like a **model-agnostic meta-prompt**:\n\n* you keep your task prompts the same\n* you only change the system layer\n* you can then see whether your templates behave more consistently or not\n\nadvanced people sometimes turn this kind of thing into real code benchmark. in this post we stay super beginner-friendly: two prompt blocks only, you can test inside the chat window.\n\n# 1. how to use with Any LLM (or any strong llm)\n\nvery simple workflow:\n\n1. open a new chat\n2. put the following block into the system / pre-prompt area\n3. then ask your normal questions (math, code, planning, etc)\n4. later you can compare “with core” vs “no core” yourself\n\nfor now, just treat it as a math-based “reasoning bumper” sitting under the model.\n\n# 2. what effect you should expect (rough feeling only)\n\nthis is not a magic on/off switch. but in my own tests, typical changes look like:\n\n* answers drift less when you ask follow-up questions\n* long explanations keep the structure more consistent\n* the model is a bit more willing to say “i am not sure” instead of inventing fake details\n* when you use the model to write prompts for image generation, the prompts tend to have clearer structure and story, so many people feel “the pictures look more intentional, less random”\n\nfrom a prompt-engineering angle, this helps because:\n\n* you can reuse the same task prompt on top of this core and get **more repeatable behaviour**\n* system-level “tension rules” handle some stability, so your task prompts can focus more on UX and less on micro-guardrails\n* when you share prompts with others, their results are less sensitive to tiny wording differences\n\nof course, this depends on your tasks and the base model. that is why i also give a small 60s self-test later in section 4.\n\n# 3. system prompt: WFGY Core 2.0 (paste into system area)\n\ncopy everything in this block into your system / pre-prompt:\n\n    WFGY Core Flagship v2.0 (text-only; no tools).

The LLM adds double line breaks anyway because it thinks the output looks better with more spacing. \"Aim for about 16 words.\" LLM gives you 40 because the thought was \"complex\", and surely you'd want the full explanation.\n\nThe problem is positive-only instructions. When you only tell an LLM what TO do, it treats your instruction as a suggestion and optimizes for what it thinks is \"better\". These things are trained to be helpful. Helpful means more detail, cleaner formatting, and fuller explanations, even when you explicitly asked for less.\n\nThe fix is dead simple. Add the negative.\n\n* \"Use single line breaks.\" → LLM adds double line breaks\n* \"Use single line breaks, NOT double line breaks\" → immediate compliance\n* \"Aim for 16 words, can vary 13-19\" → LLM writes 27-52 words\n* \"Aim for 16 words. NEVER exceed 19 — hard limit\" → stays in range\n\nSame instruction. One just closes the loophole.\n\nThe reason this works is that LLMs treat positive instructions as preferences and negative instructions as constraints. \"Do X, NOT Y\" means \"Y is prohibited.\" Different weight entirely.\n\nThe place this matters most is hard limits, word counts, formatting rules, and output structure. Anywhere you need compliance, not creativity. Telling a model \"be conversational\" is fine as a positive-only instruction because flexibility is the point. But telling a model to \"keep it under 20 words\" needs the explicit \"NEVER exceed 20 words\" or it'll blow past it the moment it has something interesting to say.\n\nOne more thing, check your own prompts for soft language. \"Can vary\", \"if appropriate\", \"longer responses are fine for emotional scenes\". Every one of those is a door you left open. If the limit is the limit, close it.\n\nWhat's the instruction you've rewritten ten times and it still ignores?",

      "text": "The entire conversation around prompting is built on a quiet *hope*.\n\nThat if you get good enough at it, the AI will eventually *understand* you. That the next model will close the gap. That somewhere between better techniques and smarter systems, the machine will start to get what you mean.\n\nIt won't. And waiting for it is the thing holding most people back.\n\nThe gap closes from your side. Entirely. That's not a limitation to work around, it's the actual game.\n\n\n\n# The work nobody does first\n\nBefore building better prompts, you have to understand what you're building them for.\n\nNot tips. Not techniques. The actual underlying process. What happens structurally when words go in. Why certain patterns generate a single clean output and others branch into drift. Where the model has to make a decision you didn't know you were asking it to make, and makes it silently, without telling you.\n\nMost people skip this completely. They go straight to prompting. They get inconsistent results and assume the model is the variable. It rarely is.\n\nThe model is fixed. The pattern you feed it is the variable. And you can't design better patterns without understanding what the machine actually does with them.\n\nThis is **not magic**. This is advanced computing. The sooner that lands, the faster everything else improves.\n\n\n\n# Clarity chains\n\nThere's a common misconception that the goal is one perfect prompt.\n\nIt isn't. It can't be. A single prompt can never carry enough explicit context to close every gap, and trying to make it do so produces bloated, contradictory instructions that create more drift, not less.\n\nThe real procedure is a chain of *clarity*.\n\nYou start with rough intent. You engage with the model, not to get an output, but to sharpen the signal. You ask it what's ambiguous in what you just said. Where it would have to guess. What words are pulling in different directions. What's missing that it would need to proceed cleanly.\n\nEach exchange adds direction. Each exchange reduces the branches the model has to choose between. By the time the real prompt arrives, most of the decisions have already been made, explicitly, **consciously**, by you.\n\nAnd here's the part most people miss: do this with the exact model you're going to use. Not a different one. Every model processes differently. The one you're working with knows better than any other what creates coherence inside it. Use that. Ask it directly. Let it tell you how to talk to it.\n\nThen a judgment call. If the sharpening conversation was broad, open a fresh chat and deliver the clean prompt without the noise. If it was already precise, already deep into the subject, stay. The signal is already built.\n\nThe goal at every step is **clarity**, **coherence**, and **honesty** about what you don't know yet. Both you and the model. Neither should be pretending to own certainty about unknown topics.\n\n\n\n# Implicit is the enemy\n\nHuman communication runs on implication. You leave things out constantly, tone, context, shared history, things any person in the same room would simply know. It works because the person across from you is filling those gaps from lived experience.\n\nThe model has none of that. **Zero**.\n\nEvery gap you leave gets filled with *probability*. The most statistically likely completion given the pattern so far. Which might be close to what you meant. Or might be the most common version of what you seemed to mean, which is a different thing, and you'll never know the difference unless the output surprises you.\n\nThe implicit gap is not an AI problem. It's a human one. We are wired for implication. We expect to be understood from partial signals. We carry that expectation directly into prompting and then wonder why the outputs drift.\n\nNothing implicit survives the translation.\n\n\n\n# Own the conversation\n\nMost people approach AI as a service. You submit a request. You evaluate the response. You try again if it's wrong.\n\nThat's the lowest leverage way to use it.\n\nThe higher leverage move is to **own** the conversation completely. To understand the machine well enough that you're never hoping, you're engineering. To treat every exchange as both an output and a lesson in how this specific model processes this specific type of problem.\n\nEvery time you prompt well, you learn to think more precisely. Every time you ask the model to show you where your signal broke down, you learn something about your own assumptions. The compounding isn't in the outputs. It's in what you become as a thinker across hundreds of exchanges.\n\nAI doesn't amplify what you know. It amplifies how clearly you can think, regarding the architecture.\n\nThat's the actual leverage. And it's entirely on you.\n\n\n\n# The ceiling\n\nFaster models don't fix shallow prompting. They produce faster, more fluent versions of the same drift.\n\nWe are always waiting for the next model to break through, yet we are not reaching any true deepness with none of these models, because they don't magically understand us.\n\nThe depth has always been available. It's on the other side of understanding the machine instead of *hoping* the machine understands you.\n\nThat shift is available right now. No new model required.\n\n\n\n*Part of an ongoing series on understanding AI from the inside out, written for people who want to close the gap themselves.*",

          "text": "This is some of the best advice I’ve seen on the topic. Most conversations about prompting really are just people hoping for magic rather than doing the work to understand how the model actually thinks. The part about clarity chains is spot on, iterative refinement is way more reliable than trying for a one-and-done prompt.\n\nOne thing I didn’t see mentioned: documenting your “voice” or style guidelines in a way the model can reference, beyond just including them in the prompt. Building out a set of reference examples, almost like a mini-corpus of your own work, can really help anchor the model and reduce output drift, especially if you update it over time. That’s actually why I built a tool to automate some of that process and handle versioning, happy to share more if anyone’s interested. But even without tools, that meta-layer of process around prompting is a huge unlock for consistency.",

If you can describe it, Claude Code can build it. But as the cost of shipping hits zero, a new, more expensive villain has emerged: **Architecture Drift.**\n\nWhen you have autonomous agents shipping 30+ PRs a day, the prompt isn't the bottleneck; it's the **Governance.** Without strict SOPs, your codebase becomes a \"Ship of Theseus\" that no human can actually explain or debug.\n\n# The Blueprint for Agentic Governance\n\nI’ve spent the last year mapping out the specific **Orchestration Frameworks** and **Governance SOPs** required to manage these AI Coworkers without losing control of the system.\n\n**I’m sharing the full roadmap and blueprints for the community here:** 🔗[**Claude Cowork: The AI Coworker Roadmap**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eduonix/claude-cowork-the-ai-coworker?ref=d7in7h)\n\n# Why \"Prompt Engineering\" is evolving into \"Systems Curation\":\n\n1. **Contextual Pollution:** In 1M+ token windows, \"Noise\" is the new Hallucination. We need prompts that act as **Governance Gates**, not just instruction sets.\n2. **State Management:** How do you maintain a single \"Source of Truth\" when three different agents are refactoring the same module simultaneously?\n3. **The Verification Paradox:** As logic becomes industrialized, the human role shifts from **\"Writer\"** to **\"Air Traffic Controller.\"**\n\nThe most valuable \"prompt engineers\" of 2026 aren't the ones who write the best loops; they are the ones who build the **Standard Operating Procedures** that keep an autonomous workforce from drifting off-strategy.\n\n**I’m curious to hear from the community:** How are you handling **version control conflict** when multiple agents are hitting the same repo? Are you using a \"Master Evaluator\" agent, or are you moving back to strict human-gated merges?",
