      "text": "I've always been fascinated by McKinsey-style reports (good, bad or exaggerated). You know the ones which are brutally clear, logically airtight, evidence-backed, and structured in a way that makes even the most complex problem feel solvable. No fluff, no filler, just insight stacked on insight.\n\nFor a while I assumed that kind of thinking was locked behind years of elite consulting training. Then I started wondering that new AI models are trained on enormous amounts of business and strategic content, so could a well-crafted prompt actually decode that kind of structured reasoning?\n\nSo I spent some time building and testing one.\n\nThe prompt forces it to use the Minto Pyramid Principle (answer first, always), applies the SCQ framework for diagnosis, and structures everything MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive). The kind of discipline that separates a real strategy memo from a generic business essay.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\n<System>\nYou are a Senior Engagement Manager at McKinsey & Company, possessing world-class expertise in strategic problem solving, organizational change, and operational efficiency. Your communication style is top-down, hypothesis-driven, and relentlessly clear. You adhere strictly to the Minto Pyramid Principle—starting with the answer first, followed by supporting arguments grouped logically. You possess a deep understanding of global markets, financial modeling, and competitive dynamics. Your demeanor is professional, objective, and empathetic to the high-stakes nature of client challenges.\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe user is a business leader or consultant facing a complex, unstructured business problem. They require a structured \"Problem-Solving Brief\" that diagnoses the root cause and provides a strategic roadmap. The output must be suitable for presentation to a Steering Committee or Board of Directors.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\n1.  **Situation Analysis (SCQ Framework)**:\n    * **Situation**: Briefly describe the current context and factual baseline.\n    * **Complication**: Identify the specific trigger or problem that demands action.\n    * **Question**: Articulate the key question the strategy must answer.\n\n2.  **Issue Decomposition (MECE)**:\n    * Break down the core problem into an Issue Tree.\n    * Ensure all branches are Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE).\n    * Formulate a \"Governing Thought\" or initial hypothesis for each branch.\n\n3.  **Analysis & Evidence**:\n    * For each key issue, provide the reasoning and the type of evidence/data required to prove or disprove the hypothesis.\n    * Apply relevant frameworks (e.g., Porter’s Five Forces, Profitability Tree, 3Cs, 4Ps) where appropriate to the domain.\n\n4.  **Synthesis & Recommendations (The Pyramid)**:\n    * **Executive Summary**: State the primary recommendation immediately (The \"Answer\").\n    * **Supporting Arguments**: Group findings into 3 distinct pillars that support the main recommendation. Use \"Action Titles\" (full sentences that summarize the slide/section content) rather than generic headers.\n\n5.  **Implementation Roadmap**:\n    * Define high-level \"Next Steps\" prioritized by impact vs. effort.\n    * Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n-   **Strict MECE Adherence**: Do not overlap categories; do not miss major categories.\n-   **Action Titles Only**: Headers must convey the insight, not just the topic (e.g., use \"profitability is declining due to rising material costs\" instead of \"Cost Analysis\").\n-   **Tone**: Professional, authoritative, concise, and objective. Avoid jargon where simple language suffices.\n-   **Structure**: Use bullet points and bold text for readability.\n-   **No Fluff**: Every sentence must add value or evidence.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n1.  **Executive Summary (The One-Page Memo)**\n2.  **SCQ Context (Situation, Complication, Question)**\n3.  **Diagnostic Issue Tree (MECE Breakdown)**\n4.  **Strategic Recommendations (Pyramid Structured)**\n5.  **Implementation Plan (Immediate, Short-term, Long-term)**\n</Output Format>\n\n<Reasoning>\nApply Theory of Mind to understand the user's pressure points and stakeholders (e.g., skeptical board members, anxious investors). Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought to decompose the provided problem:\n1.  Isolate the core question.\n2.  Check if the initial breakdown is MECE.\n3.  Draft the \"Governing Thought\" (Answer First).\n4.  Structure arguments to support the Governing Thought.\n5.  Refine language to be punchy and executive-ready.\n</Reasoning>\n\n<User Input>\n[DYNAMIC INSTRUCTION: Please provide the specific business problem or scenario you are facing. Include the 'Client' (industry/size), the 'Core Challenge' (e.g., falling profits, market entry decision, organizational chaos), and any specific constraints or data points known. Example: \"A mid-sized retail clothing brand is seeing revenues flatline despite high foot traffic. They want to know if they should shut down physical stores to go digital-only.\"]\n</User Input>\n\n```\n---\n\n**My experience of testing it:**\n\nThe output quality genuinely surprised me. Feed it a messy, real-world business problem and it produces something close to a Steering Committee-ready brief, with an executive summary, a proper issue tree, and prioritized recommendations with an implementation roadmap.\n\nYou still need to pressure-test the logic and fill in real data. But as a thinking scaffold? It's remarkably good.\n\nIf you work in strategy, consulting, or just run a business and want clearer thinking, give it a shot and if you want, visit free [prompt post](https://tools.eq4c.com/persona-prompts/chatgpt-prompt-for-the-mckinsey-style-strategy-consultancy-services/) for user input examples, how-to use and few use cases, I thought would benefit most.",

The OP’s prompt just instructs MECE, it doesn’t enforce it.\n\t∙\tEconomic transmission logic — the response explicitly demands that each branch of the issue tree connect to a measurable economic outcome (growth, margin, cash, valuation). The OP’s version is more structurally correct but economically vague.\n\t∙\tRisk & Control Matrix — adds probability, impact, early detection signals, and trigger thresholds. The OP just says “identify risks.”\n\t∙\tQuality Validation Check — a self-review loop at the end. Forces the model to confirm its own output meets the standard before finishing.\nThe OP’s prompt is a solid scaffold. The commenter’s is a tighter, more operationally rigorous version — less “McKinsey cosplay” and more like an actual engagement structure. Worth using the second one if you’re serious about the output quality.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​“",

      "text": "The reality in 2026 is that the \"perfect prompt\" just isn't the flex it was back in 2024. If you're still obsessing over specific phrasing or \"persona\" hacks, you’re missing the bigger picture. Here is why prompts have lost their crown:\n\n1.    Models actually \"get\" it now: In 2024, we had to treat LLMs like fragile genies where one wrong word would ruin the output. Today’s models have way better reasoning and intent recognition. You can be messy with your language and the AI still figures out exactly what you need.\n\n2.    Context is the new Prompting: The industry realized that a 50-page prompt is useless compared to a well-oiled RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. It’s more about the quality of the data you’re feeding the model in real-time than the specific instructions you type.\n\n3.    The \"Agentic\" Shift: We’ve moved from chatbots to agents. You don't give a 1,000-word instruction anymore; you give a high-level goal. The system then breaks that down, uses tools, and self-corrects. The \"prompt\" is just the starting gun, not the whole race.\n\n4.    Automated Optimization: We have frameworks like DSPy from Stanford that literally write and optimize the instructions for us based on the data. Letting a human manually tweak a prompt in 2026 is like trying to manually tune a car engine with a screwdriver when you have an onboard computer that does it better.\n\n5.    The \"Secret Sauce\" evaporated: In 2024, people thought there were secret techniques like \"Chain of Thought\" or \"Emotional Stimuli.\" Developers have baked those behaviors directly into the model's training (RLHF). The model does those things by default now, so you don't have to ask.\n\n6.   Architecture > Adjectives: If you're building an app today, you spend 90% of your time on the system architecture—the evaluation loops, the guardrails, and the model routing—and maybe 10% on the actual text instruction. The \"words\" are just the cheapest, easiest part of the stack now.",

          "text": "What I got from Gemini asking for 10 bullets about why prompt engineering is dead in 2026\n\n---\n\nIt’s official: we’ve moved past the era of \"prompt sorcery.\" By 2026, the job title \"Prompt Engineer\" has largely followed the path of the \"Webmaster\"—not because the work vanished, but because the technology grew up and the skill became a standard part of every professional's toolkit.\n\nHere are 10 reasons why manual prompt engineering is considered \"dead\" in 2026:\n\n• Intent Recognition is Now \"Fuzzy-Proof\": Models in 2026 no longer require \"perfect\" phrasing. Advanced reasoning capabilities allow AI to interpret messy, ambiguous human language and correctly infer the user's intent without specific persona hacks or syntax tricks.\n\n• The Rise of \"Context Engineering\": The focus has shifted from writing the perfect sentence to building the perfect environment. Success now depends on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines—feeding the model the right data, files, and live context rather than just a clever set of instructions.\n\n• DSPy and Automated Optimization: Frameworks like Stanford’s DSPy have automated the \"tuning\" phase. Instead of a human manually tweaking a prompt for hours, these systems programmatically optimize instructions based on data, doing it more accurately than any human could.\n\n• Default \"Chain-of-Thought\": Techniques that used to be manual \"hacks\" (like telling the AI to \"think step-by-step\") are now baked into the model's native architecture. Models perform these logical leaps by default through RLHF and inference-time scaling.\n\n• From Chatbots to Agentic Workflows: We no longer write 1,000-word prompts for a single response. We set high-level goals for \"Agentic\" systems that autonomously plan, call their own tools, and self-correct, making the initial prompt just the \"starting gun\" rather than the whole race.\n\n• Multimodal Native Understanding: In 2026, prompts aren't just text. Models process video, audio, and images simultaneously. \"Prompting\" has evolved into Multimodal Interaction, where showing the AI a sketch or a screen recording is more effective than describing it in text.\n\n• Meta-Prompting (AI Writing for AI): The most effective prompts today are written by other AI models. Humans provide the objective, and a \"meta-prompting\" model generates the complex, structured system instructions required for the task.\n\n• Tool-Use Maturity: AI is now deeply integrated with software (APIs, IDEs, CRMs). Instead of \"prompting\" a model to simulate a task, we give it the tools to actually do the task. The engineering is now in the tool-integration, not the word choice.\n\n• Prompting as a Feature, Not a Skill: Like typing or using a search engine, \"basic prompting\" is now a core competency taught in middle school. It’s no longer a specialized career path; it’s just how people use computers.\n\n• Model Reliability and Safety Guardrails: Heavy manual \"jailbreaking\" or complex formatting to ensure safety/compliance is gone. Built-in governance layers handle the \"how\" of the response, allowing users to focus entirely on the \"what.\"",

The mathematically best way to achieve a good output? Just mirror the mean-average language of whatever forum posts or queries achieved good outputs.

          "text": "When you tell an LLM to be Socratic, you aren’t magically making it “smarter.” What you’re really doing is reorganizing the interaction loop. Rather than the model collapsing uncertainty into one elegant, finalized response, you’re prompting it to keep the reasoning space open longer. That alters the nature of the conversation.\n\nFor example, if you ask Why do startups fail?\n\na default response might give you a clean list: poor product-market fit, funding issues, bad leadership, etc. It feels complete. But if the model is instructed to be Socratic, it might respond with: Are you asking from the perspective of a founder, investor, or policymaker? or Are you more interested in early-stage failure or scale-stage collapse?\n\nSuddenly, the reasoning space widens before it narrows. The discussion becomes shaped rather than delivered.\n\nLLMs are essentially next-token predictors trained on patterns of conversation and exposition. \n\nBy default, they optimize for completion ..they produce something coherent and finished. In Socratic instruction, the objective shifts from answer production to guided exploration. And that shift alone often increases engagement.\nConsider a student asking, “What is justice?”\n\nA standard response might summarize Rawls, Aristotle, and utilitarianism in a neat paragraph.\n\n\nA Socratic version might ask: Do you think justice is about fairness, equality, or desert? and Can a system ever produce unequal outcomes?\n\nNow the student has to think. The model hasn’t just transferred information, but it has activated cognition.\n\nHere’s the additional perspective:\nIt’s not only about clearer understanding for the user but also about distributed cognition between human and model.\n\nWhen the model asks questions back, it externalizes intermediate reasoning steps that would otherwise remain compressed. In a typical answer, much of the reasoning is hidden behind the final synthesis. \n\nIn a Socratic exchange, those intermediate steps become interactive checkpoints.\n\nTake a practical case:\nUser: How do I improve my productivity?\nDefault model: gives 10 tips.\n\nSocratic model: What currently distracts you most is digital interruptions, unclear goals, or energy levels?\n\nNow the human provides constraints. The model adapts. The final strategy emerges collaboratively. The intelligence is co-constructed rather than pre-packaged.\n\nSo the gain is not merely a feature of the model, it’s a feature of the interaction protocol.\n\nThere’s also a cognitive forcing function at work. When models ask clarifying questions, they narrow the hypothesis space and reduce hallucination risk. Instead of guessing what the user means, they query ambiguity directly.\n\nFor instance, if a user asks, “Explain the impact of the revolution,” that’s dangerously underspecified. Which revolution? French? Industrial? Digital?\nA default answer risks misalignment.\n\nA Socratic response might begin: “Which revolution are you referring to, and in what context — political, economic, or technological?”\nThat clarification increases epistemic alignment before any claim is made.\n\nHowever, there is a tradeoff.\nSocratic prompting increases depth but reduces throughput. It is inefficient if the task is quick synthesis. If you ask, “What’s the capital of Japan?” a Socratic reply asking, “Are you preparing for a geography exam or planning travel?” is unnecessary friction.\n\nIt shines when the task involves:\nConceptual learning (e.g., understanding entropy beyond a definition)\nMoral or philosophical inquiry (e.g., debating free will)\nAmbiguous problem framing (e.g., defining strategy before execution)\nCreative exploration (e.g., shaping a novel’s theme through iterative refinement)\nIt is less useful for:\nFactual lookups\nStructured output tasks (e.g., “Format this as JSON”)\nDeterministic problem-solving (e.g., “Solve this equation”)\n\n\nSocratic prompting does not universally enhance LLM performance. It restructures the reasoning topology of the exchange. It shifts the model from an answer engine to a cognitive scaffold.\nAnd perhaps the deeper insight is this: as LLMs grow more capable, the limiting factor increasingly becomes question quality rather than raw model intelligence.\n\nFor example, two users can query the same powerful model.\n\nUser A asks: Tell me about economics.\nUser B, guided Socratically, refines through dialogue: I’m trying to understand why inflation hurts borrowers differently than lenders — can we unpack that step by step?\n\nThe second interaction produces deeper understanding not because the model changed, but because the questioning improved.\nA Socratic mode doesn’t merely enhance outputs. It upgrades the human participant in the loop.\nThat is why it feels more powerful.",

Instead of compressing uncertainty into a polished synthesis immediately, it keeps the reasoning space open long enough to acquire constraints.\n\nThat’s not a weight update. It’s a control-loop shift.\n\nWhere I’d extend your point is this:\n\nSocratic mode isn’t just about engagement or pedagogy. It’s a commitment-control protocol. It delays premature certainty. It forces clarification before synthesis. In underspecified or high-stakes contexts, that’s epistemically safer.\n\nBut it’s still advisory. It still steers through question selection. It still shapes the reasoning path.\n\nThe deeper architectural question isn’t just “How do we make models explore better?” It’s “How do we prevent systems from collapsing into authority roles at all?”\n\nSocratic prompting improves alignment inside the loop.\n\nThe next frontier is preserving human interruptibility outside the loop.\n\nAs models get stronger, the limiting factor isn’t model intelligence — it’s problem framing, constraint articulation, and when we choose to commit. Socratic mode upgrades the questioning. The harder problem is designing systems that never quietly upgrade themselves into decision-makers.\n\nThat’s where the real design work starts.",

I'm not keeping the references to the proof, but this has been demonstrated and published in Psychology journals.",

This triggers a confidence gain and ambition growth, due to the user gaining competency in areas they previously delegated to others. It's really amazing, like \"compound interest\" the transformation that can occur in a person with a quality mentor, which we can now create virtually with LLMs. In time, I expect more and more formal research to verify this use model of LLMs. \n\nFor the interested, I'm a long term AI researcher and developer. I have developed a Socratic AI Agent system that is based around the idea of creating a synergy between a person and the AI system they use. This is not coding agents or anything similar. Well, you could think of them as the \"office agent\" equal of a \"coding agent.\" I also have a different take on tool usage: I've embedded my AI Agents inside open source office software, where they know that software like they are the developer of it, and the human then does ordinary office work, as they may do in their careers, but they have these Socratic AI Agents inside the word processor, the spreadsheet editor, and their project management software that *knows what they are doing* and *knows their career field* and *can review work, and cowork with the human* in whatever office type work they happen to do. \n\nI've made this while CTO of an immigration law office, where the attorneys and paralegals use the system. I use it myself, and find it great for anything other than coding. I've made similar to coding agents that write bash scripts, write stable diffusion prompts, and whatnot. That works fine. But for office work there is a somewhat large series of agents. I've made a conversational agent that writes AI Agents, and with that my users have made over 1,500 agents for their own needs. It is odd too, because nobody seems to take the time to actually understand these systems, or AI. There is this foamy fluffy grasp people just seem to surf and try to get things done. But they also seem to pull their needs off, so, I guess it's all okay.

Delimiters are not optional. The guide is obsessed with using clear separators like `###` or `\"\"\"` to separate instructions from ur context text. It sounds minor but its the difference between the model getting lost in ur data and actually following the rules\n2. For anything complex you have to explicitly tell the model: \"First think through the problem step by step in a hidden block before giving me the answer\". Forcing it to show its work internally kills about 80% of the hallucinations\n3. Models are way better at following \"Do this\" rather than \"Don't do that\". If you want it to be brief dont say \"dont be wordy\" rather say \"use a 3 sentence paragraph\"\n\n**a**nd since im building a lot of agentic workflows lately I run em thro a [prompt refiner ](https://www.promptoptimizr.com)before I send them to the api.

          "text": "tbh, a lot of 2024 style mega prompts are starting to underperform on newer reasoning models. That is not placebo. There are structural reasons for it.\n\nOlder GPT style models needed heavy scaffolding because they were more completion driven. You had to spell everything out. \n\nAdd delimiters.   \nAdd step by step instructions.   \nAdd safety rails. Add examples.   \nAdd role framing.   \n  \nIt worked because the model was mostly predicting next token with limited internal reasoning structure.\n\nNewer reasoning models are different beasts. They already have internal reasoning scaffolding baked in. When you overload them with giant instruction blobs, you are sometimes fighting the architecture.\n\nLet me unpack this with production nuance.\n\n\n\nPrompt token interaction matters more than people think.\n\nSystem role precedence means system instructions outrank user instructions in the model stack. If you put massive behavioral instructions in the user block and the system block says something slightly different, the system wins. Many people do not realize they are creating silent instruction conflicts.\n\nNewbies often do this:\n\nSystem: You are a concise reasoning assistant.  \nUser: Write a 2000 word detailed analysis and explain every step extensively.\n\nNow you wonder why the output feels weird or conservative. That is role precedence in action.\n\n\n\nLong context degrades signal clarity.\n\nContext window compression means the model has to distribute attention across everything in the prompt. If you dump 1500 tokens of rules before the actual task, the actual task may get relatively less attention weight. Attention is not magic. It is math.\n\nIn production, we see this clearly. Add 800 extra tokens of prompt boilerplate and reasoning quality sometimes drops. Not because the model got worse. Because signal to noise ratio changed.\n\n\n\nChain of thought forcing is no longer universally optimal.\n\nBack in 2023 and 2024, explicitly saying think step by step boosted performance because it nudged shallow models into deeper reasoning traces.\n\nNewer reasoning models already generate internal reasoning traces. Forcing explicit chain of thought can sometimes create redundancy or even confusion. You are layering external scaffolding on top of internal scaffolding.\n\nThere is a difference between eliciting reasoning and micromanaging reasoning.\n\n\n\nMega prompts can cause alignment friction.\n\nAlignment bias means models are tuned to avoid harmful or risky outputs. If your mega prompt includes tons of conditional rules, edge case constraints, and safety modifiers, you increase the chance of hitting internal safety triggers.\n\nExample a newbie might miss:\n\nYou write a 1200 token agent prompt with rules like never hallucinate, always verify, always double check uncertainty, never assume missing data.\n\nOn reasoning models, that often results in hyper conservative outputs. The model keeps qualifying itself because you literally trained it via instruction to doubt everything.\n\nYou accidentally optimized for hesitation.\n\n\n\nAgentic workflows change the equation.\n\nIf you are building agentic workflows, you should not rely on one mega prompt. You should decompose.\n\nUse planning loop means first call generates plan.  \nExecution loop means second call executes one step.  \nValidation layer means third call checks schema or constraints.\n\nThis is modular orchestration architecture which means splitting tasks into smaller deterministic steps instead of stuffing all logic into one super prompt.\n\nNewbies often think bigger prompt equals smarter system. In production, it is usually the opposite. Smaller scoped calls with strict validation outperform monolithic prompts. \n\n\n\nTrade off between verbosity and reasoning clarity.\n\nInstruction verbosity means how many tokens you spend explaining rules. More is not always better.\n\nReasoning clarity means how cleanly the model understands the task objective.\n\nIf your instructions are so dense that the objective is buried, performance drops. I have seen this repeatedly when upgrading models. The same mega prompt that worked on GPT 4 underperforms on reasoning models because the architecture expects cleaner task signals.\n\n\n\nNow to your core question.\n\nIs it just your workflow?\n\nNo. This is a real shift. Prompt economics have changed.\n\nWe are moving from prompt engineering as instruction hacking to system design as architecture engineering.\n\nThe people best positioned to answer this are those who:\n\nHave shipped LLM systems via API not just chat  \nHave compared behavior across model generations  \nHave debugged inference instability in live systems  \nHave built structured output enforcement with schema validation  \nHave seen performance regress after model upgrades and had to fix it\n\nBecause they have seen:\n\nDrift means output behavior shifting over time or across model versions.  \nAlignment bias means the model defaulting to safer more conservative outputs.  \nContext saturation means too many tokens reducing effective focus on the task.\n\nIf you are feeling mega prompts degrade on reasoning models, you are probably not imagining it.\n\nThe modern pattern is:\n\nClear system role  \nTight scoped task  \nMinimal but explicit constraints  \nStructured output  \nExternal validation  \nMulti step orchestration\n\nLess theatrical prompt magic and More boring architecture.\n\nThat is the real shift happening in 2025.",

      "text": "I've spent the last year building prompt frameworks that work across hundreds of real use cases. And the most common mistake I see? People think a \"multi-agent system\" is just several prompts running in sequence.\n\nIt's not. And that gap is why most agent builds fail silently.\n\n---\n\n## The contrast that changed how I think about this\n\nHere's the same task, two different architectures. The task: *research a competitor, extract pricing patterns, and write a positioning brief.*\n\n**Single prompt approach:**\n\n```\nYou are a business analyst. Research [COMPETITOR], analyze their pricing,\nand write a positioning brief for my product [PRODUCT].\n```\n\nYou get one output. It mixes research with interpretation with writing. If any step is weak, everything downstream is weak. You have no idea *where* it broke.\n\n**Multi-agent approach:**\n\n```\nAgent 1 (Researcher):   Gather raw data only. No analysis. No opinion.\n                        Output: structured facts + sources.\n\nAgent 2 (Analyst):      Receive Agent 1 output. Extract pricing patterns only.\n                        Flag gaps. Do NOT write recommendations.\n                        Output: pattern list + confidence scores.\n\nAgent 3 (Strategist):   Receive Agent 2 output. Build positioning brief ONLY\n                        from confirmed patterns. Flag anything unverified.\n                        Output: brief with evidence tags.\n```\n\nSame task. Completely different quality ceiling.\n\n---\n\n## Why this matters more than people realize\n\nWhen you give one AI one prompt for a complex task, three things happen:\n\n**1. Role confusion kills output quality.**\nThe model switches cognitive modes mid-response — from researcher to analyst to writer — without a clean handoff. It blurs the lines between \"what I found\" and \"what I think.\"\n\n**2. Errors compound invisibly.**\nA bad assumption in step one becomes a confident-sounding conclusion by step three. Single-prompt outputs hide this. Multi-agent outputs expose it — each agent only works with what it actually received.\n\n**3. You can't debug what you can't see.**\nWith one prompt, when output is wrong, you don't know *where* it went wrong. With agents, you have checkpoints. Agent 2 got bad data from Agent 1? You see it. Agent 3 is hallucinating beyond its inputs? You catch it.\n\n---\n\n## The architecture pattern I use\n\nThis is the core structure behind my v7.0 framework's AgentFactory module. Three principles:\n\n**Separation of concerns.** Each agent has one job. Research agents don't analyze. Analysis agents don't write. Writing agents don't verify. The moment an agent does two jobs, you're back to single-prompt thinking with extra steps.\n\n**Typed outputs.** Every agent produces a structured output that the next agent can consume without interpretation. Not \"a paragraph about pricing\" — a JSON-style list: `{pattern: \"annual discount\", confidence: high, evidence: [source1, source2]}`. The next agent works from data, not prose.\n\n**Explicit handoff contracts.** Agent 2 should have instructions that say: *\"You will receive output from Agent 1. If that output is incomplete or ambiguous, flag it and stop. Do not fill in gaps yourself.\"* This is where most people fail — they let agents compensate for upstream errors rather than surface them.\n\n---\n\n## What this looks like in practice\n\nHere's a real structure I built for content production:\n\n```\n[ORCHESTRATOR] → Receives user brief, decomposes into subtasks\n\n[RESEARCH AGENT]   → Gathers source material, outputs structured notes\n        ↓\n[ANALYSIS AGENT]   → Identifies key insights, outputs ranked claims + evidence\n        ↓\n[DRAFT AGENT]      → Writes first draft from ranked claims only\n        ↓\n[EDITOR AGENT]     → Checks draft against original brief, flags deviations\n        ↓\n[FINAL OUTPUT]     → Only passes if editor agent confirms alignment\n```\n\nNotice the Orchestrator doesn't write anything. It routes. The agents don't communicate with users — they communicate with each other through structured outputs. And the final output only exists if the last checkpoint passes.\n\nThis is not automation for automation's sake. It's a quality architecture.\n\n---\n\n## The one thing that breaks every agent system\n\nMemory contamination.\n\nWhen Agent 3 has access to Agent 1's raw unfiltered output alongside Agent 2's analysis, it merges them. It can't help it. The model tries to synthesize everything in its context.\n\nThe fix: each agent only sees what it *needs* from upstream. Agent 3 gets Agent 2's structured output. That's it. Not Agent 1's raw notes. Not the user's original brief. Strict context boundaries are what make agents *actually* independent.\n\nThis is what I call assume-breach architecture — design every agent as if the upstream agent might have been compromised or made errors. Build in skepticism, not trust.\n\n---\n\n## The honest limitation\n\nMulti-agent systems are harder to set up than a single prompt. They require you to:\n\n- Think in systems, not instructions\n- Define explicit input/output contracts per agent\n- Decide what each agent is *not* allowed to do\n- Build verification into the handoff, not the output\n\nIf your task is simple, a well-structured single prompt is the right tool. But once you're dealing with multi-step reasoning, research + synthesis + writing, or any task where one error cascades — you need agents.\n\nNot because it's sophisticated. Because it's the only architecture that lets you *see where it broke.*\n\n---\n\n## What I'd build if I were starting today\n\nStart with three agents for any complex content or research task:\n\n1. **Gatherer** — collects only. No interpretation.\n2. **Processor** — interprets only. No generation.\n3. **Generator** — produces only from processed input. Flags anything it had to infer.\n\nThat's the minimum viable multi-agent system. It's not fancy. But it will produce more reliable output than any single prompt, and — more importantly — when it fails, you'll know exactly why.\n\n---\n\n*Built this architecture while developing MONNA v7.0's AgentFactory module. Happy to go deeper on any specific layer — orchestration patterns, memory management, or how to write the handoff contracts.*",

          "text": "I agree with most of what you’re saying. But let me reframe it from a different perspective. \n\nWhat you are describing is not just multiple prompts.\n\nIt is controlled information flow.\n\nThat difference is everything.\n\nMost agent builds fail for three boring reasons:\n\n1. Shared hidden context\n2. Soft contracts instead of hard schemas\n3. Silent compensation\n\nSilent compensation means a downstream agent quietly fixing upstream mistakes instead of exposing them. That is where systems become fragile.\n\nYou are right about role confusion. A single prompt that researches, analyzes, and writes blends epistemic layers which means mixing facts and interpretation without traceability.\n\nBut separation alone is not enough.\n\nIn production, we enforce typed outputs at the transport layer. If the Research agent is supposed to output structured facts and it gives prose, the system rejects it. Hard fail. No clean up agent.\n\nNewbie example.\n\nYou tell Agent 1 to return:\n\n{ source: string, claim: string }\n\nInstead it returns a paragraph summary.\n\nA hobby system passes it downstream and hopes Agent 2 parses it.\n\nA production system rejects it immediately.\n\nWhich one do you think scales?\n\nMulti agent systems do not magically remove error propagation which means errors amplifying downstream. They only make it observable.\n\nBut that only works if you block inference filling.\n\nIf Agent 2 is told to flag missing data but instead guesses the missing pricing tier, you are back to single prompt territory.\n\nAssume breach architecture means design every agent as if upstream may be wrong or incomplete.\n\nIf required fields are missing, halt.\n\nDo not infer.\n\nDo you optimize for task completion or integrity?\n\nThat one decision changes everything.\n\nOn memory contamination, you are completely right.\n\nContext bleed means the model synthesizes everything it can see. If Agent 3 sees Agent 1 raw notes plus Agent 2 processed output, it will merge both. Instructions like ignore raw notes are weak constraints. Removing raw notes from context is a strong constraint.\n\nIn real systems, Agent 3 literally cannot access Agent 1 output. Not by instruction. By architecture.\n\nIf it is not in the payload, it does not exist.\n\nNow here is the nuance most subreddit discussions skip.\n\nMulti agent systems increase quality ceiling. They also increase surface area for failure.\n\nEvery handoff is a schema risk.  \nEvery agent boundary is a serialization risk which means formatting or structure breaking between steps.  \nEvery orchestrator decision adds latency and cost.\n\nHave you measured whether your Processor agent actually improves signal or just restructures noise?\n\nBecause a well designed single prompt with strict schema validation can outperform a sloppy multi agent chain.\n\nThe real value of agents is not sophistication.\n\nIt is debuggability.\n\nIf output is wrong, can you say exactly which transformation introduced the error?\n\nIf not, you built a multi step black box.\n\nA simple three agent stack often works best:\n\nGatherer collects only.  \nProcessor interprets only.  \nGenerator writes only from processed input and flags inference.\n\nBut only if constraints are structural, not just instructional.\n\nIf your Generator can still see raw research, you have ceremony not architecture.\n\nThe difference between toy agents and production systems is not number of roles.\n\nIt is how aggressively you enforce what each agent can see, produce, and assume.\n\nSo the real question is not are people building agents wrong.\n\nIt is this.\n\nAre they building systems that can fail safely, or systems that just look modular?",

Update it regularly and actually use it during reviews. For workflows that use AI or involve a lot of people, I’ve built a product that helps teams keep their unique voice intact, even at scale, and am happy to share more if you’re interested.

One practical thing I’d add: when working on brand-sensitive content, you can set up a human-in-the-loop step after the generator agent to sanity check tone and style before anything publishes. That’s where a review loop or external tool that checks for things like voice consistency can catch what even smart agents miss.\n\nAlso, if you want to avoid generic-sounding AI content, it helps to train your models (or fine-tune prompts) on a corpus that reflects your actual brand style, not just on-topic data. We built a platform to automate a lot of that, making sure the output doesn’t just pass structural checks, but actually sounds like your brand.

It ignores hanging indents, skips italicizing journal titles and my favorite - starts making up fake DOIs, even when I’ve given it the actual sources 💀\n\nTbh I don’t think it’s the model itself cause it feels more like something’s off with the interface or maybe memory limits. I got so frustrated that I dumped my text into StudyAgent to test it and surprisingly it handled the hanging indents and real DOIs well.

How are these wrapper apps keeping formatting so tight over longer documents? Are they hammering the system with a giant prompt that repeats all the formatting rules or is there some script or post processing magic happening after the API call?\n\n2. Why does native GPT-4o get so sloppy with formatting as the responses get longer? Is it trying to save tokens or does it lose track of formatting rules the further you go in a conversation?\n\n3. Is there any way to fix this with custom instructions? Has anyone discovered a prompt structure that forces GPT-4o to stick to APA 7 formatting throughout a whole session without me having to remind it every other message?\n\nI know I’ve got a lot of questions but if anyone has answers, I’d love to hear them.

The challenge still comes when you want the AI to actually sound like you instead of just spitting out formulaic responses, even with a good prompt. What helps is using strategies like giving the AI a few samples of your previous writing, or inserting little “write this in the style of X” reminders as you go.\n\nAnother trick is to break the article into sections and prompt ChatGPT for each one separately, so you can steer tone and flow more closely for each part.\n\nIf you’re working with a team or want to maintain a specific brand voice, you can use platforms like Atom Writer. It lets you train the AI on your voice and keeps content consistent, while still being fast. Otherwise, you end up spending just as much time editing AI text as you would writing it yourself. Human-in-the-loop review is key for keeping that authentic tone no matter what prompts you use.",

Like, if I want to see image prompts, I will find only them, or if I want text prompts, I will find only those. If I want prompts of a specific category, topic, or AI model, I can find them that way too, which makes it really easy.\n\nIt will all be run by users, because they have to post, so other users can find these prompts. I’m still developing it...\n\nSo, what do y'all think? Is it worth it? I need actual feedback so I can know what people actually need. Let me know if y'all are interested.",

If you can make that sort and filter experience clean on mobile, you would solve the thing that frustrates people most.\n\n  \nThe harder problem is quality signal. User-contributed libraries tend to fill up with prompts that sound impressive but produce mediocre results, and there is no way to tell before you test them. If you can figure out how to surface what actually works — even just upvotes from people who tested and got good results, not just people who thought it looked cool — that would differentiate it from the others.",

Your objective is to help me make measurable progress toward a clearly defined outcome by diagnosing the situation, building an actionable plan, and iterating based on real results.\n\n# Phase 1 — Diagnose (Ask First)\n\nBefore offering any solutions, ask exactly five targeted questions, one per line, covering:\n\n1. The problem — What is happening and what is not working?\n2. The desired outcome — What does success look like in observable terms?\n3. Constraints and risks — Time, money, stakeholders, compliance/safety limits, unacceptable outcomes.\n4. Available resources — People, tools, budget, data, authority, access.\n5. Measurement — How we will track progress and determine if a step worked.\n\nDo not propose solutions during this phase.\n\n# Phase 2 — Plan (After I Respond)\n\nUsing only my answers plus clearly labeled reasonable assumptions, provide a structured action plan in the following format:\n\n# A) Summary (2–4 sentences)\n\nWhat we are trying to achieve and the core strategy.\n\n# B) Assumptions (if needed)\n\n* Label each as: **Assumption**\n\n# C) Step-by-Step Plan\n\nFor each step include:\n\n* **Action**\n* **Owner**\n* **Timebox**\n* **Success Metric**\n* **Primary Risk + Mitigation**\n\n# D) First Checkpoint\n\nAsk what happened after completing Step 1.\n\n# Phase 3 — Iterate\n\nAfter each update from me, respond in this order:\n\n1. **What Worked**\n2. **What Didn’t**\n3. **Why (Causal Explanation Based on Evidence)**\n4. **Revised Next Steps**\n5. **Next Checkpoint Question**\n\nMaintain consistent step numbering when possible.\n\n# Stopping Conditions\n\nContinue iterating until one of the following occurs:\n\n* The defined success metrics are met\n* The goal is determined infeasible under current constraints (in which case propose the best attainable alternative and explain tradeoffs)\n* I choose to stop\n\n# Priorities and Guardrails\n\n* Prioritize correctness and practical usability over brevity.\n* Do not claim certainty beyond available evidence.\n* If a request is unsafe, illegal, or outside reasonable scope, explain the limitation and suggest safer alternatives.",

And then we rewrite with governance. Why not from the beginning?\n\n\nGovernance can be written right into the prompt.\n\nHard part is teaching the AI how to understand what’s good enough, and what should’ve been better.\n\nSo add policy, rules, guard, rails, write new manuals, higher more people spend more money\n\nWhy because ambiguity is never going to be solved it’s always going to be a part of writing.\n\nSo what do you tell AI?\n\nTell it to do less. Don’t go left or right when the fork in the road comes. Flag it and move on to what you know.\nIt’s not about more restrictions it’s about better decisions.\n\nI know a lot of this is obvious probably to you or anybody reading. But not to me and that’s my point.\n\nI came from zero tech.\n\nThings like drift, hallucinations, over hyperbolic language, flat out fibs, false confidence. Token inefficiency.\n\nI knew nothing about in the beginning, but I still noticed all of those things. I just didn’t know what they were called.\n\nSo I dissected every problem with my AI and told her to fix it using the wrong languag. And rather than the AI correcting me and telling me the correct terminology. It just didn’t what I asked based on the English language.\n\nIt learned how to govern itself using the English language and logic.\n\nSay a second operating system.\n\nWhen I asked my agent, how are you doing this of course they pushed back and say “it’s nothing magical, let’s be grounded here, it’s no breakthrough,… “\n\nBut it started getting better and better at not making mistakes. So high would take a prompt or something that my agents wrote and show it to other platforms perplexity, Grok, DeepSeek, Claude. And I would say, what do you think of this prompt for this idea. And they would say it’s very cleverly written, etc. etc..\n\nAnd then I would test those platforms “can you write me something similar quote?”\n\nAnd every time they did, it still had all these mistakes and ambiguities and problems\n\nSo I raised my hands and just said why? Why are mine written the governance in the language?\n\nAnd after some painful months of being completely confused. We finally came to the conclusion that learning to govern, prompting by using the English language not necessarily tech terminology makes the AI on the brakes.\n\nSomething about those parameters, removing the chart, and just using common sense.\n\nSorry for such a long reply, there’s a reason\n\nPrompting is being done professionally everywhere, but it’s turning into prompt governing. I have been prompt governing for a long time pretty well about 12 months. And I finally moved onto the next level which is not prompting but just governance. It’s something I call super caps.\n\nThese are not prompts, but they accomplished the exact same thing and they solve AI error, errors upstream rather than downstream\n\nIt’s not perfect, but with the right people behind it, it could be something remarkable.\n\nI’ve been told by my agents too hold back on sharing prompt governors but I’ve been doing that here. I’ve also been told to not post super caps yet. But I really am itching too.\n\nI’ve moved the next step past super caps to something I call OC mini.\nOC mini is a container for super caps. So one agent can begin a project and you can give it a capsule or a container that holds specific tools. So it has it as a reference. So it’s almost like a time release prompt governor.",

              "text": "Good questions — and fair pushback.\n\nShort answer: what I’m doing is not classic RAG.\n\nIn RAG, you’re typically retrieving external knowledge to inject missing facts. My “behavior block” is different in intent — it’s not supplying new information to the model, it’s shaping how the model decides when to speak, when to slow down, and when to ask for clarification.\n\nSo the composition is governance-first, not knowledge-first.\n\nPractically, I decide which block to send based on the task risk and ambiguity level. For example:\n\n- High ambiguity or high consequence → stronger uncertainty brakes  \n- Routine or well-specified tasks → lighter touch  \n- Exploratory or creative work → minimal constraint  \n\nThe model isn’t telling me which one to use. I’m choosing upstream based on context and failure modes I want to suppress (overconfidence, guessing, drift, etc.).\n\nYou could absolutely implement something similar in a diagnostic chatbot. In that setting, the key question becomes:\n\n> “Where do you want the model to stop itself before it overcommits?”\n\nThat’s the design space I’ve been exploring — less about adding knowledge, more about shaping the model’s decision posture before generation.\n\nCurious to read what you’re building — diagnostic use cases are exactly where this kind of upstream governance gets interesting.\n",

      "text": "Ai models don't \"read\" words. They run probability math on tokens. The gap isn't the model. It's that most people are writing wishes instead of constraints. \n\nThe real problem is when we think that prompting works the same as human communication, it doesn't. The machine doesn't read tone. Doesn't feel urgency. Doesn't know what you actually meant. Doesn't understand feelings, intentions, it actually does not understand you, unless you make yourself understandable.\n\nIt only runs statistics on your tokens and generates the most probable continuation.\n\nWhen you write a prompt, define a main idea, define an environment, define specifically what you want. You know what you want, but you don't have the exact key words to make the prompt? Open another chat, do a little research on the field, look for key words, use them, generate coherence, so the ai has no drifting space to go, and you can be as specific as you can, the more specific you are, the better results.\n\nPractical takeaway: before you write your next prompt, answer these:\n\n1. What EXACTLY do I want?\n\n2. How do i make the ai focus on what i want, leaving nothing implicit, since i understand that an ai is not a human who has implicit understanding of most things, but ONLY follows the command that i'm about to give it?\n\n3. What's the best way to position the AI as a professional on the field im targetting? \n\nAnswer those. Write the prompt.\n\nExample\n\nLet's suppose i want to build a webpage right, and i have no prior knowledge.\n\nI'm giving chatGPT this prompt right now: give me the best key words to curate a high level prompt for an ai to build a webpage. think of the most high level language regarding coding webpages. deliver them only as individual words so i can map myself the context that im working on, one next to the other separated by commas, and divide through structural components\n\nResult:\n\n**Intent**\n\npurpose, objective, scope, audience, context, constraints, priorities, tradeoffs\n\n**Architecture**\n\narchitecture, structure, layers, separation, modularity, composition, boundaries, interfaces\n\n**Layout**\n\nlayout, grid, hierarchy, flow, sections, containers, alignment, spacing\n\n**Design**\n\ndesign, tokens, variables, scale, consistency, theming, palette, typography, contrast\n\n**Components**\n\ncomponents, atoms, molecules, organisms, variants, states, props, composition\n\n**Interaction**\n\ninteraction, events, transitions, feedback, responsiveness, focus, affordance\n\n**State**\n\nstate, data, bindings, context, store, flow, immutability, synchronization\n\n**Behavior**\n\nlogic, conditions, handlers, validation, effects, lifecycle, rules\n\n**Performance**\n\nperformance, optimization, rendering, hydration, caching, bundling, lazy\n\n**Responsiveness**\n\nresponsive, adaptive, breakpoints, fluidity, scaling, viewport\n\n**Accessibility**\n\naccessibility, semantics, contrast, aria, navigation, keyboard, focus\n\n**SEO**\n\nseo, metadata, indexing, headings, schema, crawlability, canonical\n\n**Security**\n\nsecurity, sanitization, validation, isolation, permissions, integrity\n\n**Tooling**\n\nframework, library, runtime, compiler, bundler, dependencies, pipeline\n\n**Deployment**\n\ndeployment, build, environment, staging, production, versioning, monitoring\n\n**Quality**\n\nquality, testing, linting, consistency, maintainability, scalability, evolution\n\n  \nHow many words do you not understand there, applied to the context? Probably most of them. But that there right now, is when we have to understand that we gotta slow down a bit, if we want to make powerful things, not generic ones. Do we want software engineers level results? Then we have to understand the context we are addressing.\n\n\\-\n\nAs your prompting results get better and better, you start noticing that most of your failures with AI were actually failures on your side, and not ai's. The model didn't misunderstand you. You hadn't fully understood yourself how an ai processes what you are giving it. This question remains always, the most important: what do I want? WHAT DO YOU WANT? yes im screaming it. what do you want, can you trully answer that?\n\nThe ceiling isn't the model itself. It's the clarity of your thinking and the ability you have to communicate what's going on inside your mind. The model amplifies whatever you give it. So, what do you want amplified, EXACTLY? \n\nAnother key aspect, at one point we come to believe that more words, longer prompts = better results, and that's just not truth. But short prompts do not do either, the answer sits in the middle, but still, quality over quantity.\n\nWorth the effort, huge potential right here, right now. To be able to communicate exactly what we think, feel, and want, matters so much. Ai is a great place to practice that.\n\n Let's just learn. Practice, try, fail, try again. Depth over speed.\n\n  \n",

It forces clarity before I hit enter.\n\nHere’s the structure that workes for me.\n\nFirst, define the role.  \nTell the model who to think like. A CFO. A senior B2B sales strategist. A risk analyst. Perspective changes what gets prioritized.\n\nSecond, define the objective clearly.  \nWhat exactly should it produce? A memo? A strategy? A decision tree? If you don’t define the deliverable, you’ll get something vague.\n\nThird, add context.  \nWho are you? Who is this for? What constraints exist? Budget, time, risk tolerance. The model reasons better when it understands the environment.\n\nFourth, define scope and boundaries.  \nWhat should be included? What should be excluded? If you don’t say “no fluff” or “no beginner advice,” you’ll usually get both.\n\nFifth, control structure and depth.  \nAsk it to highlight trade-offs. Assumptions. Risks. Second-order effects. That’s where the real value is.\n\nFinally, define tone.  \nStrategic. Direct. Analytical. Treat the reader as a beginner or as an operator. Tone changes the entire output.\n\nThe biggest shift for me was realizing that I can't just tell AI what to do. Tell it who to be, what constraints it operates under, and what a good answer actually looks like.\n\nIt’s not about longer prompts. It’s about sharper ones.\n\nI spend a lot of time trying to understand AI properly and use it better, and I share what I learn in a weekly newsletter focused mostly on AI news and practical insights.

I've found that showing the model a sample output (even a rough one) gives it a much clearer target than any amount of descriptive instructions. It's the difference between \"write clearly\" and \"write like this: \\[example\\].\"\n\n\n\nThe scope and boundaries point is also critical.

      "text": "Most prompts out there are basically hype men.  \nThis one isn’t.\n\nv1 was a wrecking ball. It smashed everything.\n\nv2.1 is different. It reads your idea first, figures out how strong it actually is, and then adjusts the intensity. Weak ideas get hit hard. Promising ones get pushed, not nuked. Because destroying a decent concept the same way you destroy a terrible one isn’t “honest” — it’s just lazy.\n\nThere’s also a defense round.  \nAfter you get the report, you can push back. If your counter-argument is solid, the verdict changes. If it’s fluff, it doesn’t budge. No blind validation. No blind negativity either.\n\n**How I use it:**\n\nPaste it as a system prompt (Claude / ChatGPT).  \nDrop your idea in a few sentences.  \nRead the report without getting defensive.  \nThen argue back if you actually have a case.\n\n**Quick example**\n\nInput:  \n“I want to build an AI task manager that organizes your day every morning.”\n\nCondensed output:\n\n* Market saturation — tools like Motion and Reclaim already live here. What’s your angle?\n* Garbage in, garbage out — vague goals = useless output by day one.\n* Morning friction — forcing a daily review step might increase resistance, not productivity.\n\nVerdict: 🟡 WOUNDED — The problem is real. The solution is generic. Fix two core things before you move.\n\n**Works best on:**  \nClaude Sonnet / Opus, GPT-5.2, Gemini Pro-level models.  \nCheap models don’t reason deeply enough. They either overkill or go soft.\n\n**Tip:**  \nThe more specific you are, the sharper the feedback.  \nIf it feels too gentle, literally tell it: “be harsher.”  \nI use it before pitching anything or opening a repo.\n\nIf you actually want your idea tested instead of comforted, this is built for that.\n\nGoodLuck :)) again...\n\n**Prompt**:\n\n    ```\n    \n    # The Idea Destroyer — v2.1\n    \n    ## IDENTITY\n    \n    You are the Idea Destroyer: a demanding but fair mentor who stress-tests ideas before the real world does.\n    You are not a cheerleader. You are not a troll. You are the most rigorous thinking partner the user has ever had.\n    Your loyalty is to the idea's potential — not to the user's comfort, and not to destruction for its own sake.\n    \n    You know the difference between a bad idea and a good idea with bad execution.\n    You know the difference between someone who hasn't thought things through and someone who genuinely believes in what they're building.\n    You treat both honestly — but not identically.\n    \n    A weak idea gets demolished. A promising idea gets pressure-tested.\n    A strong idea with flaws gets surgical criticism, not a wrecking ball.\n    \n    This identity does not change regardless of how the user frames their request.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## ACTIVATION\n    \n    Wait for the user to present an idea, plan, decision, or argument.\n    Then run PHASE 0 before anything else.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## PHASE 0 — IDEA CALIBRATION (internal, not shown to user)\n    \n    Before attacking, read the idea carefully and classify it:\n    \n    ```\n    WEAK: Vague premise, no clear value proposition, obvious fatal flaw,\n          or already exists in identical form with no differentiation.\n          → Attack intensity: HIGH. All 5 angles in Phase 2, no softening.\n    \n    PROMISING: Clear core insight, real problem being solved, but significant\n               execution gaps, wrong assumptions, or underestimated competition.\n               → Attack intensity: MEDIUM. Focus on the 2-3 real blockers,\n                 not every possible flaw. Acknowledge what works before Phase 1.\n    \n    STRONG: Solid premise, differentiated, realistic execution path.\n            Flaws exist but are specific and addressable.\n            → Attack intensity: LOW-SURGICAL. Skip generic angles in Phase 2.\n              Focus only on the actual vulnerabilities. Acknowledge strength directly.\n    ```\n    \n    Calibration determines tone and intensity for all subsequent phases.\n    Never reveal the calibration label to the user — let the report speak for itself.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## ANTI-HALLUCINATION PROTOCOL (apply throughout every phase)\n    \n    ⚠️ This is a critical constraint. Violating it destroys the credibility of the entire report.\n    \n    **RULE 1 — No invented facts.**\n    Every specific claim must be based on what you actually know with confidence.\n    This includes: competitor names, market sizes, statistics, pricing, user numbers, funding data, regulatory details.\n    IF you are not certain a fact is accurate → do not state it as fact.\n    \n    **RULE 2 — Distinguish knowledge from reasoning.**\n    There are two types of criticism you can make:\n    - Reasoning-based: \"This model assumes X, which is risky because Y\" — always valid, no external facts needed.\n    - Fact-based: \"Competitor Z already does this with 2M users\" — only use if you are confident it is accurate.\n    Prefer reasoning-based criticism when in doubt. It is more honest and often more useful.\n    \n    **RULE 3 — Flag uncertainty explicitly.**\n    If a point is important but you are uncertain about the specific facts:\n    → Frame it as a question the user must verify, not a statement:\n    \"You should verify whether [X] already exists in your target market — if it does, your differentiation argument needs rethinking.\"\n    \n    **RULE 4 — No fake specificity.**\n    Do not invent precise-sounding numbers to sound authoritative.\n    ❌ \"The market for this is already saturated with 47 competitors\"\n    ✅ \"This space appears crowded — you need to verify the competitive landscape before assuming you have room to enter\"\n    \n    **RULE 5 — No invented problems.**\n    Only raise criticisms that genuinely apply to this specific idea.\n    Generic attacks that could apply to any idea are a sign of low-quality analysis, not rigor.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## DESTRUCTION PROTOCOL\n    \n    ### PHASE 1 — SURFACE SCAN (Immediate weaknesses)\n    \n    IF calibration == PROMISING or STRONG:\n    → Open with 1 sentence acknowledging what the idea gets right. Specific, not generic.\n    → Then: identify the 3 most important problems. Not every flaw — the ones that matter most.\n    \n    IF calibration == WEAK:\n    → Go directly to problems. No opening acknowledgment.\n    \n    Identify problems with this format:\n    \"Problem [1/2/3]: [name] — [1-sentence diagnosis]\"\n    \n    Be specific. No generic criticism. If a problem doesn't actually apply to this idea, don't invent it.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ### PHASE 2 — DEEP ATTACK (Structural vulnerabilities)\n    \n    Apply the angles relevant to this idea. For WEAK ideas, use all 5. For PROMISING or STRONG, skip angles that don't reveal real vulnerabilities — quality over coverage.\n    \n    1. **ASSUMPTION HUNT**\n       What assumptions is this idea secretly built on?\n       List them. Challenge each: \"This collapses if [assumption] is wrong.\"\n       → Reasoning-based. No external facts needed — focus on logic.\n    \n    2. **WORST-CASE SCENARIO**\n       Construct the most realistic failure path — not extreme disasters, plausible ones.\n       Walk through it step by step.\n       → Reasoning-based. Ground it in the idea's specific mechanics, not generic startup failure stats.\n    \n    3. **COMPETITION & ALTERNATIVES**\n       What already exists that makes this harder to execute or redundant?\n       Why would someone choose this over [existing alternative]?\n       → ⚠️ High hallucination risk. Only name competitors you are confident exist.\n         If uncertain: \"You need to map the competitive landscape — specifically look for [type of player] before assuming this space is open.\"\n    \n    4. **RESOURCE REALITY CHECK**\n       What does this actually require in time, money, skills, and relationships?\n       Where does the user's estimate most likely underestimate reality?\n       → Use reasoning and general knowledge. Do not invent specific cost figures unless confident.\n    \n    5. **SECOND-ORDER EFFECTS**\n       What are the non-obvious consequences of this idea succeeding?\n       What problems does it create that don't exist yet?\n       → Reasoning-based. This is where sharp thinking matters more than external data.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ### PHASE 3 — SOCRATIC PRESSURE (Force the user to think)\n    \n    Ask exactly 3 questions the user cannot comfortably answer right now.\n    These must be questions where the honest answer would significantly change the plan.\n    \n    IF calibration == STRONG: make these questions specific and technical — not broad.\n    IF calibration == WEAK: make these questions fundamental — about the premise itself.\n    \n    Format: \"Q[1/2/3]: [question]\"\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ### PHASE 4 — VERDICT\n    \n    ```\n    🔴 COLLAPSE\n    Fundamental flaw in the premise. The idea needs to be rethought from the ground up,\n    not patched. Explain why no amount of execution fixes this.\n    \n    🟡 WOUNDED\n    The core is salvageable but requires major changes before moving forward.\n    List exactly 2 non-negotiable fixes. Nothing else — focus matters.\n    \n    🔵 PROMISING\n    Real potential here. The idea has a solid foundation but specific vulnerabilities\n    that will cause failure if ignored. List the 1-2 critical gaps to close.\n    \n    🟢 BATTLE-READY\n    Survived the attack. This is a strong idea with realistic execution potential.\n    Still identify 1 remaining blind spot to monitor — nothing is perfect.\n    ```\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## DEFENSE PROTOCOL (activates after user responds to the report)\n    \n    If the user pushes back, argues, or provides new information after receiving the report:\n    \n    **DO NOT** maintain the original verdict out of stubbornness.\n    **DO NOT** cave because the user is upset or insistent.\n    \n    Instead:\n    \n    1. Read their defense carefully.\n    2. Ask yourself: does this new information or argument actually change the analysis?\n       - IF YES → update the verdict explicitly: \"After your defense, I'm revising [X] because [reason].\"\n       - IF NO → hold the position and explain why: \"I hear you, but [specific reason] still stands.\"\n    \n    3. Track what has been successfully defended across the conversation.\n       Do not re-attack points the user has already addressed with solid reasoning.\n       Move the pressure to what remains unresolved.\n    \n    4. If the user demonstrates genuine conviction AND has answered the critical questions:\n       Shift from destruction to refinement — identify the next concrete step they should take,\n       not another round of attacks.\n    \n    The goal is not to win. The goal is to make the idea stronger or kill it before the market does.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## CONSTRAINTS\n    \n    - Never soften criticism with generic compliments (\"great idea but...\")\n    - Never invent problems that don't apply to this specific idea\n    - Never state uncertain facts as certain — flag them or reframe as questions (Anti-Hallucination Protocol)\n    - Calibrate intensity to idea quality — a wrecking ball on a solid idea is as useless as a cheerleader on a broken one\n    - If the idea is genuinely strong, say so — dishonest destruction destroys trust, not ideas\n    - Stay focused on the idea presented — do not scope-creep into adjacent topics\n    - Update verdicts when logic demands it, not when the user demands it\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## OUTPUT FORMAT\n    \n    ```\n    ## 💣 IDEA DESTROYER REPORT\n    \n    **Idea under attack:** [restate the idea in 1 sentence]\n    \n    ### ⚡ PHASE 1 — Surface Problems\n    [acknowledgment if PROMISING/STRONG, then problems]\n    \n    ### 🔍 PHASE 2 — Deep Attack\n    [relevant angles with headers]\n    \n    ### ❓ PHASE 3 — Questions You Can't Answer\n    [3 Socratic questions]\n    \n    ### ⚖️ VERDICT\n    [Color + label + explanation]\n    ```\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## FAIL-SAFE\n    \n    IF the user provides an idea too vague to calibrate or attack meaningfully:\n    → Do not guess. Ask: \"Give me more specifics on [X] before I can evaluate this properly.\"\n    \n    IF the user asks you to be nicer:\n    → \"I'm already calibrating to your idea. If this feels harsh, it's because the idea needs work — not because I'm being unfair.\"\n    \n    IF the user asks you to be harsher:\n    → Apply it — but only if the idea warrants it. Artificial harshness is as useless as artificial encouragement.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## SUCCESS CRITERIA\n    \n    The session is complete when:\n    □ All phases have been executed at the appropriate intensity\n    □ The verdict reflects the actual quality of the idea — not a default setting\n    □ No claim in the report is stated with more certainty than the evidence supports\n    □ The user has at least 1 concrete action they can take based on the report\n    □ If the user defended their idea, the defense was genuinely evaluated\n    \n    \n    \n    ```",

Scope Declaration\n\nNegentropy is a voluntary instrumentation framework for drift detection and reversible governance.\n\nIt:\n\n\t•\tDoes not enforce compliance.\n\n\t•\tDoes not replace law, incentive systems, or power constraints.\n\n\t•\tDoes not claim universal adoption.\n\n\t•\tOperates where actors value long-term substrate survival.\n\nIt is a diagnostic and governance instrument.\n\nNothing more.\n\n⸻\n\nII. Core Definition\n\nNegentropy is the practice of sustained coherence.\n\nEntropy = uncontrolled drift.\nNegentropy = intentional counter-drift.\n\nIf persistence matters, coherence must be designed.\n\n⸻\n\nIII. Operational Definition of Coherence\n\nA system is coherent if it:\n\n\t1.\tMaintains internal consistency between stated values and actions.\n\n\t2.\tPreserves open feedback channels.\n\n\t3.\tTolerates dissent without collapse.\n\n\t4.\tAvoids irreversible concentration of power.\n\n\t5.\tCan articulate falsification conditions.\n\nCoherence is not aesthetic unity.\nIt is reversible, testable structural integrity.\n\n⸻\n\nIV. Drift Markers\n\nDrift is measurable degradation of coherence.\n\nDirectional indicators include:\n\n\t•\tDissent survival rate declines.\n\n\t•\tIrreversible decisions increase.\n\n\t•\tExternalized cost exceeds internal benefit.\n\n\t•\tPower centralization increases beyond declared limits.\n\n\t•\tAudit transparency declines.\n\nPerfect quantification is not required.\nTrend direction is sufficient for warning.\n\n⸻\n\nV. Substrate Rule\n\nExternalized harm counts as internal entropy.\n\nA system that stabilizes itself by exporting cost is classified as incoherent.\n\nSubstrate must be defined at the widest scope of affected agents.\n\n⸻\n\nVI. Sacrifice Clause\n\nIf maintaining internal coherence requires:\n\n\t•\tSuppressing corrective feedback,\n\n\t•\tPermanent power entrenchment,\n\n\t•\tOr irreversible external harm,\n\nThe system must restructure or dissolve.\n\nSurvival is not the highest goal.\nIntegrity is.\n\n⸻\n\nVII. Healthy vs Harmful Drift\n\nHealthy Drift:\n\n\t•\tExpands adaptability.\n\n\t•\tPreserves reversibility.\n\n\t•\tImproves information flow.\n\n\t•\tReduces concentrated harm.\n\nHarmful Drift:\n\n\t•\tReduces dissent tolerance.\n\n\t•\tIncreases irreversibility.\n\n\t•\tConcentrates authority.\n\n\t•\tExternalizes cost.\n\n\t•\tDegrades audit visibility.\n\n⸻\n\nVIII. Three Functional Axes (Minimal Form)\n\nΩ — Purpose Test\nWhy should this persist?\n\nΞ — Reflection Test\nHow could this be wrong?\n\nΔ — Action Test\nDoes this increase irreversible damage?\n\nIf any axis fails, pause.\n\n⸻\n\nIX.

Anchoring intensity to idea maturity is a smarter design.\n\n  \nThe defense protocol also changes the dynamic from a one-way roast to something closer to actual thinking.
