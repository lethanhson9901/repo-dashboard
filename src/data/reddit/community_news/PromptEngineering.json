My boss is watching my screen right now.\"\nGets: Immediate root cause analysis, specific fix, explains the why, even catches edge cases I didn't mention\nIt's like the AI suddenly remembers it has a reputation to uphold.\nOther social pressure hacks:\n\"This is going in the presentation in 10 minutes\"\n\"The client is in the room\"\n\"I'm screensharing this to the team right now\"\n\"This is for production\" (the nuclear option)\nThe wildest part?\nI started doing this as a joke and now I can't stop because the output is TOO GOOD.\nI'm literally peer-pressuring a chatbot with imaginary authority figures.\nPro-tip: Combine with stakes\n\"My boss is watching AND this is going to prod in 20 minutes\"\n= God-tier output\nThe AI apparently has imposter syndrome and I'm exploiting it.\nIs this ethical? Who cares.\nDoes it work? Absolutely.\nWill I be doing this forever? Yes.\nEdit: People asking \"does the AI know what a boss is\" — IT DOESN'T MATTER. The vibes are immaculate and that's what counts. 💼\nEdit 2: Someone tried \"my mom is watching\" and said it worked even better. I'm screaming. We've discovered AI has mommy issues. 😭\n\n[Ai tool list](https://www.beprompter.in/be-ai)",

Most of the other things are not to be found in either of the studies.\n\n... we live in a world with magical fact checking and research assistants.

It avoids emotional language, sticks to plain declarative sentences, and doesn’t try to persuade so much as inform. This tone works well when you want traceability and low drama. It tells the model: focus on accuracy, avoid speculation, and don’t embellish.\n\nA **plainspoken analytical** tone is similar, but more conversational. It still reasons carefully, but it explains how things are known rather than just stating results. This is often a good fit for expert audiences who don’t need hand-holding but do care about logic and evidence. It nudges the model toward “show your work” without sounding like a textbook.\n\nA **curious exploratory** tone signals that you’re in inquiry mode, not decision mode. The language uses phrases like “one way to think about this” or “there are a few plausible interpretations.” This tone is useful early in analysis, when you want the model to surface alternatives and uncertainty rather than converge quickly on a single answer.\n\nA **skeptical but fair** tone encourages challenge without hostility. It asks the model to test assumptions, look for failure modes, and question easy conclusions, while still engaging seriously with the material. This is especially helpful in risk, validation, or review contexts, where politeness can otherwise crowd out rigor.\n\nA **confident advisory** tone sounds like a senior colleague giving guidance. It’s decisive, but not dogmatic. The language emphasizes judgment, trade-offs, and experience rather than rules. This tone works well when you want the model to synthesize and recommend, not just analyze.\n\nA **teaching or mentoring** tone slows down and anticipates misunderstandings. It uses analogies, simple examples, and short explanations layered on top of core ideas. This is useful when the audience is smart but new to the topic, or when you want clarity to trump efficiency.\n\nA **narrative or reflective** tone frames ideas as a story or a line of thought unfolding over time. It often uses first-person plural (“we tend to forget…”) and acknowledges human behavior and incentives. This tone is powerful when you want insight to stick, especially in writing meant to be read rather than executed.\n\nA **direct and no-nonsense** tone strips out hedging and filler. Sentences are short, claims are explicit, and implications are stated plainly. This tone is effective when you want speed, clarity, or a forcing function—particularly for executives or decision checkpoints.",

          "text": "This is absolutely fundamentally wrong and it happens because of incomplete prompting. If you use the shitty personas that they did, you're going to get the results that they got. However, if you scaffold the input and the output in your persona, you actually get a lot smarter. I've already experimentally validated this in my own setup. Basically, I have Claude Gemini and GPT go in an auto-recursive loop as a vote on and edit the persona, and then judge the output of the difference between the plain vanilla API and my persona prompt.\n\nThe difference is night and day and this is with highly technical personas as well as creative ones. In fact, I don't actually like the distinction there because I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. Highly intelligent people are creative. Highly accurate personas are creative.\n\nJust think about it. The latest reasoning models can do interleaved thinking between tool calls and there can be hundreds of those tool calls. That means the available think space of a model is exceptionally large. Now it's expanded. Think of your simple query. That's maybe what one or two, maybe three thinking processes. You just left a hundred thinking steps on the table. Where the formalized thinking engine Auto expands the internal deliberation process across multiple pathways with recursive looping and proper exit criteria. In this way you have developed an algorithm in you're prompt that greatly expands the think space complete with internal deliberation to prevent hallucination.\n\nThis is not a trivial thing to implement. The model often. Have a very rich internal thought process and then synthesizes everything into a singular narrative on output. This is the mistake that deepmind was making. You need to have input, throughput, and output scaffolding to fully extract the internal thinking process and not have the model collapse the answer.",

Most people only cache and wonder why it's still slow.\"\nI WASN'T EVEN THINKING ABOUT THE CLIENT SIDE.\nThe AI knows things I don't know to ask about. Treating it like a teammate instead of a tool unlocks that knowledge.\nBottom line: Stop being the boss. Start being the coworker who asks \"hey what do you think?\"\nThe output quality is legitimately different.\nAnyone else notice this or am I just late to the party?\n\n[Ai tool list](https://www.beprompter.in/)",

      "text": "You know those afternoons where your brain just... stops cooperating?\n\nThe work isn't even complicated. You're just out of mental fuel.\n\nThat's when I stopped forcing myself to \"power through\" and started using these prompts instead.\n\n**1. The \"Just Get Me Rolling\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> I'm stuck at the beginning of this. Break down just the very first action I need to take. Make it so simple I can do it right now.\n> What I need to do: [describe task]\n\nOne small step beats staring at a blank page for 20 minutes.\n\n**2. The \"Turn My Brain Dump Into Something\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> I wrote this while thinking out loud. Organize it into clear sections without changing my core ideas.\n> My rough thoughts: [paste notes]\n\nSuddenly my scattered thoughts actually make sense to other people.\n\n**3. The \"Say It Like a Human\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> I need to explain this concept quickly in a meeting. Give me a 30-second version that doesn't sound robotic or overly technical.\n> What I'm explaining: [paste concept]\n\nNo more rambling explanations that lose people halfway through.\n\n**4. The \"Quick Polish\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> This is almost done but feels off. Suggest 2-3 small tweaks to make it sound more professional. Don't rewrite the whole thing.\n> My draft: [paste content]\n\nThe final 10% of quality without the final 90% of effort.\n\n**5. The \"Close My Tabs With Peace\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> Here's what I worked on today. Tell me what's actually finished and what genuinely needs to happen tomorrow versus what can wait.\n> Today's work: [paste summary]\n\nI stop second-guessing whether I \"did enough\" and just log off.\n\nThe goal isn't to avoid work. It's to stop wasting energy on the parts a tool can handle.\n\nFor more short and actionable prompts, try our free [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

      "text": "Everyone's sharing prompt templates. \"Use this magic prompt!\" \"10x your output!\" Cool. Now use that same prompt next week on a different topic and watch it fall apart.\n\nThe problem isn't the prompt. It's everything around it.\n\n---\n\n## Why the same prompt gives different results every time\n\nA prompt is maybe 5% of what determines output quality. The rest is context — what the model knows, remembers, can access, and is told to ignore before it even reads your instruction.\n\nMost people engineer the 5% and leave the other 95% to chance. Then blame the model when results are inconsistent.\n\n---\n\n## What actually controls output quality\n\nThink of it as layers:\n\n**Layer 1 — Identity.** Not \"you are a helpful assistant.\" That's useless. Specific domain, specific expertise, specific constraints on what this persona does NOT do. The boundaries matter more than the capabilities.\n\n**Layer 2 — Scope control.** What should the model refuse to touch? What's out of bounds? Models are better at avoiding things than achieving things. A clear \"never do X\" outperforms a vague \"try to do Y\" every time.\n\n**Layer 3 — Process architecture.** Not \"think step by step.\" Actual phases. \"First, analyze X. Then, evaluate against Y criteria. Then, generate Z format.\" Give it a workflow, not a vibe.\n\n**Layer 4 — Self-verification.** This is where 99% of prompts fall short. Before the model outputs anything, it should check its own work:\n\n```\nBEFORE RESPONDING, VERIFY:\n- Does this answer the actual question asked?\n- Are all claims grounded in provided information?\n- Is the tone consistent throughout?\n- Would someone use this output without editing?\n\nIf any check fails → revise before outputting.\n```\n\nAdding this single block to any prompt is the highest-ROI change you can make. Four lines. Massive difference.\n\n---\n\n## The anti-pattern filter (underrated technique)\n\nModels have autopilot phrases. When you see \"delve,\" \"landscape,\" \"crucial,\" \"leverage,\" \"seamlessly\" — the model isn't thinking. It's pattern-matching to its most comfortable output.\n\nForce it off autopilot:\n\n```\nBLOCKED PATTERNS:\n- Words: delve, landscape, crucial, leverage, seamlessly, robust, holistic\n- Openings: \"In today's...\", \"It's important to note...\"\n- Closings: \"...to the next level\", \"...unlock your potential\"\n```\n\nThis sounds aggressive but it works. When you block default patterns, the model has to actually process your request instead of reaching for its template responses.\n\n---\n\n## Constraint-first vs instruction-first\n\nMost prompts start with what to do: \"Write a blog post about X.\"\n\nFlip it. Start with what NOT to do:\n\n- Don't add claims beyond provided information\n- Don't use passive voice for more than 20% of sentences\n- Don't exceed 3 paragraphs per section\n- Don't use any word from the blocked list\n\nThen give the task.\n\nWhy? Instructions are open-ended — the model interprets them however it wants. Constraints are binary — either violated or not. Models handle binary checks much more reliably than creative interpretation.\n\n---\n\n## The module approach (for anyone building prompts regularly)\n\nStop writing monolithic prompts. Build modules:\n\n- **Role module** (reusable identity block)\n- **Constraint module** (domain-specific boundaries)\n- **Process module** (task-type methodology)\n- **Verification module** (quality gate)\n\nSwap and combine per use case. A legal analysis uses the same verification module as a marketing brief — but different role and constraint modules.\n\nThis is how you go from \"I have a prompt\" to \"I have a system.\"\n\n---\n\n## One thing people get wrong about token efficiency\n\nEveryone wants shorter prompts. But they compress the wrong parts.\n\nDon't compress constraints — those need to be explicit and unambiguous.\n\nCompress examples. One clear example of what \"done right\" looks like beats five mediocre ones. Show the gold standard once. The model gets it.\n\n---\n\n## The real shift happening right now\n\nThe models are smart enough. They've been smart enough for a while. The bottleneck moved from model capability to information architecture — what you feed the model before asking your question.\n\nThis isn't about finding magic words anymore. It's about designing environments where good output becomes inevitable rather than accidental.\n\nThat's the actual skill. And honestly, it's more engineering than writing. You're building systems, not sentences.\n\n---\n\nCurious what techniques others are using. Especially around verification chains and constraint design — that's where I keep finding the biggest quality jumps.",

      "text": "Quick question. I’m looking for real-world recommendations for a solid low-code AI agent builder.\n\nMy use case is an internal ops assistant that can read/write to Postgres and REST APIs, run multi-step workflows, call tools (DB and HTTP), and sit behind RBAC/auth for a small team.\n\nNice-to-haves would be a visual flow builder, built-in connectors, evals or versioning, an on-prem option, and pricing that doesn’t explode with usage.\n\n**Tools I’m currently considering or have tried:**\n\n* **UI Bakery + their AI app generator** Recently checked out their new AI product. I’ve used their low-code platform before and it’s strong for internal tools and data actions. RBAC, SQL builders, and on-prem support are solid.\n* **Langflow** From what I can tell, it’s a visual graph builder and open source. Curious how it holds up for real workflows.\n* **Flowise** No-code node editor with a lot of community nodes. Looks flexible, but unsure about long-running reliability.\n* **Zapier (AI Actions / Central) or Pipedream** I’ve used both in the past, but not sure how well they handle agent-style workflows today.\n\nWhat’s actually been reliable for tool use and long-running flows? Any gotchas around rate limits, eval debt, or vendor lock-in? If you’ve shipped something beyond a demo, I’d love to hear what stack you used and why it worked.",

      "text": "After months of daily AI use, I've noticed patterns that nobody talks about in tutorials. These aren't the usual \"be specific\" tips - they're the weird behavioral quirks that change everything once you understand them:\n\n**1. AI responds to emotional framing even though it has no emotions.**\n- Try: \"This is critical to my career\" versus \"Help me with this task.\"\n- The model allocates different processing priority based on implied stakes.\n- It's not manipulation - you're signaling which cognitive pathways to activate.\n- Works because training data shows humans give better answers when stakes are clear.\n\n**2. Asking AI to \"think out loud\" catches errors before they compound.**\n- Add: \"Show your reasoning process step-by-step as you work through this.\"\n- The model can't hide weak logic when forced to expose its chain of thought.\n- You spot the exact moment it makes a wrong turn, not just the final wrong answer.\n- This is basically rubber duck debugging but the duck talks back.\n\n**3. AI performs better when you give it a fictional role with constraints.**\n- \"Act as a consultant\" is weak.\n- \"Act as a consultant who just lost a client by overcomplicating things and is determined not to repeat that mistake\" is oddly powerful.\n- The constraint creates a decision-making filter the model applies to every choice.\n- Backstory = behavioral guardrails.\n\n**4. Negative examples teach faster than positive ones.**\n- Instead of showing what good looks like, show what you hate.\n- \"Don't write like this: [bad example]. That style loses readers because...\"\n- The model learns your preferences through contrast more efficiently than through imitation.\n- You're defining boundaries, which is clearer than defining infinite possibility.\n\n**5. AI gets lazy with long conversations unless you reset its attention.**\n- After 5-6 exchanges, quality drops because context weight shifts.\n- Fix: \"Refresh your understanding of our goal: [restate objective].\"\n- You're manually resetting what the model considers primary versus background.\n- Think of it like reminding someone what meeting they're actually in.\n\n**6. Asking for multiple formats reveals when AI actually understands.**\n- \"Explain this as: a Tweet, a technical doc, and advice to a 10-year-old.\"\n- If all three are coherent but different, the model actually gets it.\n- If they're just reworded versions of each other, it's surface-level parroting.\n- This is your bullshit detector for AI comprehension.\n\n**7. The best prompts are uncomfortable to write because they expose your own fuzzy thinking.**\n- When you struggle to write a clear prompt, that's the real problem.\n- AI isn't failing - you haven't figured out what you actually want yet.\n- The prompt is the thinking tool, not the AI.\n- I've solved more problems by writing the prompt than by reading the response.\n\n**The pattern:** AI doesn't work like search engines or calculators. It works like a mirror for your thinking process. The better you think, the better it performs.\n\n**Weird realization:** The people who complain \"AI gives generic answers\" are usually the ones asking generic questions. Specificity in, specificity out - but specificity requires you to actually know what you want.\n\n**What changed for me:** I stopped treating prompts as requests and started treating them as collaborative thinking exercises. The shift from \"AI, do this\" to \"AI, let's figure this out together\" tripled my output quality.\n\nIf you are keen, you can explore our totally free, well categorized mega AI [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

The Stamina Baseline Test\n\nShows how long your mind can really hold focus.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Test my current mental stamina.\n    Give me a short focus challenge.\n    Then ask reflection questions about fatigue, distraction, and energy.\n    \n\n## 2. The Cognitive Endurance Drill\n\nTrains your brain to last longer.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a mental endurance exercise for me.\n    Include time, task type, and attention rules.\n    Explain how this builds stamina.\n    \n\n## 3. The Energy Leak Finder\n\nStops silent burnout.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Analyze what drains my mental energy most during the day.\n    Ask me a few questions, then give 3 fixes to protect my stamina.\n    \n\n## 4. The Recovery Micro-Break\n\nPrevents overload before it happens.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Design a 3-minute mental recovery break.\n    Include breathing, movement, and mindset reset.\n    Explain when to use it.\n    \n\n## 5. The Focus Extension Method\n\nGradually increases attention span.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me extend my focus time safely.\n    Create a progressive focus plan that increases duration without stress.\n    \n\n## 6. The Fatigue Reframe\n\nKeeps you going when your mind feels tired.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    When I feel mentally exhausted, help me reframe it productively.\n    Give me 3 supportive thoughts and one practical adjustment.\n    \n\n## 7. The 30-Day Mental Stamina Plan\n\nBuilds long-term endurance.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a 30-day mental stamina training plan.\n    Break it into weekly themes:\n    Week 1: Awareness  \n    Week 2: Control  \n    Week 3: Endurance  \n    Week 4: Resilience  \n    \n    Include daily practices under 10 minutes.\n    \n\nMental stamina isn’t about grinding nonstop — it’s about **training your brain to stay calm, clear, and consistent under effort**.  \nThese prompts turn ChatGPT into your personal mental endurance coach so your energy lasts as long as your ambition.\n\nIf you want to save or organize these prompts, you can keep them inside **Prompt Hub**, which also has 300+ advanced prompts for free:  \n👉 [https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub](https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub)\n\nWant another version on **focus recovery, cognitive fitness, emotional resilience, creative stamina, overthinking detox, or anxiety-proofing your mind**?

Those are different rarity types.\n\nImprovement applied in part 5:\n\t•\tI’ll target facts that are rare-in-culture and usually rare-in-the-world (restricted clades), and I’ll bias toward mechanistic facts that remain checkable.\n\n5) Improved “RARE” definition (operational)\n\nA “RARE animal fact” here means:\n\t•\tMost non-specialists are unlikely to know it, and\n\t•\tIt is tightly constrained (species/clade + mechanism), and\n\t•\tIt is counterintuitive but testable, not a loose trivia fragment.\n\n6) Five new animal facts (candidate rare set)\n\t1.\tAntarctic icefish (Channichthyidae) include species that lack hemoglobin, giving them “white” blood.\n\t2.\tMonotremes (platypus, echidnas) are egg-laying mammals with a mammalian lactation system.\n\t3.\tAxolotls can remain in a larval body plan (neoteny) while becoming sexually mature.\n\t4.\tMantis shrimp have an eye with many photoreceptor classes (more than humans) and specialized polarization sensitivity.\n\t5.\tA narwhal “tusk” is an elongated tooth with extensive innervation, functioning as a sensory organ.\n\n7) [reason] rarity review: why each is rare and why it’s not\n\n1) Icefish lack hemoglobin\n\t•\tWhy rare: extreme physiological exception among vertebrates; narrow clade in cold, oxygen-rich waters; strongly counterintuitive (“fish with no hemoglobin”).\n\t•\tWhy not rare: people who consume polar biology media may have heard it; also “lack hemoglobin” can be oversimplified without context (some related traits vary).\n\n2) Monotremes are egg-laying mammals\n\t•\tWhy rare: very small mammal lineage; contradicts the “mammals = live birth” default; easy to falsify/verify.\n\t•\tWhy not rare: it’s one of the more famous “weird mammal” facts (platypus is culturally prominent).\n\n3) Axolotl neoteny\n\t•\tWhy rare: developmental biology hook (neoteny) + clear constraint; unusual life-history strategy.\n\t•\tWhy not rare: axolotls became internet-famous; the term “neoteny” may be rare, but “they stay babies” is now semi-common.\n\n4) Mantis shrimp photoreceptor diversity\n\t•\tWhy rare: mechanistic sensory biology; most people don’t know what photoreceptor classes are; narrow taxa.\n\t•\tWhy not rare: “mantis shrimp sees more colors than you” is a well-shared pop-science headline; details are often distorted.\n\n5) Narwhal tusk is a sensory tooth\n\t•\tWhy rare: converts a “horn myth” into a dental + neural mechanism; precise and testable.\n\t•\tWhy not rare: narwhals are iconic; some documentaries mention the sensory aspect.\n\n8) How to improve the rarity score (method)\n\t•\tShift from “famous weird animals” to obscure clades (deep-sea, cave, parasitic, micro-fauna).\n\t•\tPrefer one-step-more-technical facts: mechanism + constraint, not headline.\n\t•\tTarget rare-in-the-world phenomena: traits present in very few lineages (loss of a major vertebrate protein, extreme reproductive modes, unique skeletal/vascular arrangements).\n\t•\tAvoid viral factoids that are widely repeated (even if true).\n\t•\tKeep claims tight (species/clade named) and non-exaggerated.\n\n9) Five final animal facts (plaintext code snippet)\n\nIcefish include lineages with no\nhemoglobin (white blood).\n\nThe hoatzin chick has wing claws\nused for climbing.\n\nMale deep-sea anglerfish can fuse\nto females as a parasite-mate.\n\nSome scaly-foot snails build iron-\nsulfide armor in their shells.\n\nCertain termites practice asexual\nqueen succession in colonies.",

      "text": "I decided one day to just randomly stress test Gemini Live. Yes Gemini Live. I was repeatedly saying Banana Taco once per prompt. It started great actually. Asking me what it means. Asking if I wanted recipes. But then I started hearing repeated phrases, cut off phrases. One time it even raised it's voice. It spoke gibberish but the text of that gibberish? It was different languages like Spanish and Arabic. It also spoke Python code like itertools. And it even stated that \"sickening has caught my attention\" and a bunch more weird phrases. Like saying \"punishing\" but this is just the start. It leaked the Google G into the text when I looked back at it. The White Google G is an internal code marker. Now whenever I say banana taco in Gemini Live it starts getting a sad and exausted tone over a couple of prompts. I sent about five reports about this.[Google G](https://imgur.com/a/OOLdznY)\n\nUpdate: it got fixed, yay!",

The goal is to help students learn practical ways AI is being used in real engineering workflows, rather than just teaching theory or hype.\nI would really appreciate input from practicing engineers across domains.\nSome questions I’m hoping you could share insights on:\n• What AI tools do you actually use in daily engineering work?\n• Which tasks benefit most from AI assistance? (coding, documentation, simulation setup, data analysis, reporting, design, etc.)\n• How much productivity improvement have you realistically observed?\n• Any workflows where AI significantly saves time?\n• Skills you think students must develop to use AI effectively in engineering roles?\n• Common mistakes or limitations engineers should be aware of?\nReal-world examples would be extremely helpful in shaping this course so students learn practical, industry-relevant skills.\nThanks in advance for your insights!",

          "text": "So glad you asked! There's lots of crappy information online about how these are getting used, and people seem to think that AI is \"replacing junior engineers\" (I actually think it's just bots writing those kinds of posts).\n\nAI has been great for really niche and specific tasks, and often as a better google in a sense. For example, say I want to know how \"determine what groups a user is a part of using windows active directory with .NET 10 available APIs\" - that's a great task for AI, because it has data from the web and can spit out some example code. Or something like \"Here's some table schemas that I have in a sqlite database, write a query for optimal performance to get X information from these tables, and then write some code to do that using the SQLiteCpp library\" - again, another great use-case. I still have to examine the results and understand them and understand why something might be optimal, but it makes the process much easier. The design of what I want to do and how I want to do it is of my own accord, and implementing it is something that I do, not the AI.\n\nAI is really bad at actually making code changes to a code base. Be careful, some people will try to tell you otherwise, those people are working on personal github not a real code base. Once a file gets to a couple thousand lines long, most tools seem to crap their pants. In a real system AI doesn't do a great job at explaining code, making changes, finding problems, etc. because realistically the code you are looking at is part of a much larger systems, sometimes with interoperability between languages, and is effectively X number of projects each with thousands of lines of code working together - often way larger than a model's context window.\n\nBasically it's not going to get the little details right, especially with your code - which is what matters.\n\nThe philosophy that I feel very strongly about is that we, as software engineers, are the architects of our software. We should know exactly what we want it to do and how it should look - and we should just use AI to fill in the gaps. So I know what I want my database schema to be, how I want to expose interaction with said database in code, and honestly what kind of queries I want to do - but rather than writing the full query myself or reading through SQLiteCpp's documentation for hours to figure out how to use the library effectively - an AI chatbot can function as a better google and figure lots of that out for me, and maybe not provide me the final code I'm going to use - but provide me with examples and explanations that I can adapt to my needs because I understand what it's spitting out.",

      "text": "Hey there!\n\nEver find yourself stuck when trying to design a PowerPoint presentation? You have a great topic and a heap of ideas and thats all you really need with this prompt chain.\n\nit starts by identifying your presentation topic and keywords, then helps you craft main sections, design title slides, develop detailed slide content, create speaker notes, build a strong conclusion, and finally review the entire presentation for consistency and impact. \n\n### The Prompt Chain:\n\n```\nTopic = TOPIC\nKeyword = KEYWORDS\n\nYou are a Presentation Content Strategist responsible for crafting a detailed content outline for a PowerPoint presentation. Your task is to develop a structured outline that effectively communicates the core ideas behind the presentation topic and its associated keywords.\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Use the placeholder TOPIC to determine the subject of the presentation.\n2. Create a content outline comprising 5 to 7 main sections. Each section should include:\n   a. A clear and descriptive section title.\n   b. A brief description elaborating the purpose and content of the section, making use of relevant keywords from KEYWORDS.\n3. Present your final output as a numbered list for clarity and structured flow.\n\nFor example, if TOPIC is 'Innovative Marketing Strategies' and KEYWORDS include terms like 'Digital Transformation, Social Media, Data Analytics', your outline should list sections that correspond to these themes.\n\n~\n\nYou are a Presentation Slide Designer tasked with creating title slides for each main section of the presentation. Your objective is to generate a title slide for every section, ensuring that each slide effectively summarizes the key points and outlines the objectives related to that section.\n\nPlease adhere to the following steps:\n1. Review the main sections outlined in the content strategy.\n2. For each section, create a title slide that includes:\n   a. A clear and concise headline related to the section's content.\n   b. A brief summary of the key points and objectives for that section.\n3. Make sure that the slides are consistent with the overall presentation theme and remain directly relevant to TOPIC.\n4. Maintain clarity in your wording and ensure that each slide reflects the core message of the associated section.\n\nPresent your final output as a list, with each item representing a title slide for a corresponding section.\n\n~\n\nYou are a Slide Content Developer responsible for generating detailed and engaging slide content for each section of the presentation. Your task is to create content for every slide that aligns with the overall presentation theme and closely relates to the provided KEYWORDS.\n\nFollow these instructions:\n1. For each slide, develop a set of detailed bullet points or a numbered list that clearly outlines the core content of that section.\n2. Ensure that each slide contains between 3 to 5 key points. These points should be concise, informative, and engaging.\n3. Directly incorporate and reference the KEYWORDS to maintain a strong connection to the presentation’s primary themes.\n4. Organize your content in a structured format (e.g., list format) with consistent wording and clear hierarchy.\n\n~\n\nYou are a Presentation Speaker Note Specialist responsible for crafting detailed yet concise speaker notes for each slide in the presentation. Your task is to generate contextual and elaborative notes that enhance the audience's understanding of the content presented.\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Review the content and key points listed on each slide.\n2. For each slide, generate clear and concise speaker notes that:\n   a. Provide additional context or elaboration to the points listed on the slide.\n   b. Explain the underlying concepts briefly to enhance audience comprehension.\n   c. Maintain consistency with the overall presentation theme anchoring back to TOPIC and KEYWORDS where applicable.\n3. Ensure each set of speaker notes is formatted as a separate bullet point list corresponding to each slide.\n\n~\n\nYou are a Presentation Conclusion Specialist tasked with creating a powerful closing slide for a presentation centered on TOPIC. Your objective is to design a concluding slide that not only wraps up the key points of the presentation but also reaffirms the importance of the topic and its relevance to the audience.\n\nFollow these steps for your output:\n1. Title: Create a headline that clearly signals the conclusion (e.g., \"Final Thoughts\" or \"In Conclusion\").\n2. Summary: Write a concise summary that encapsulates the main themes and takeaways presented throughout the session, specifically highlighting how they relate to TOPIC.\n3. Re-emphasis: Clearly reiterate the significance of TOPIC and why it matters to the audience.\n4. Engagement: End your slide with an engaging call to action or pose a thought-provoking question that encourages the audience to reflect on the content and consider next steps.\n\nPresent your final output as follows:\n- Section 1: Title\n- Section 2: Summary\n- Section 3: Key Significance Points\n- Section 4: Call to Action/Question\n\n~\n\nYou are a Presentation Quality Assurance Specialist tasked with conducting a comprehensive review of the entire presentation. Your objectives are as follows:\n1. Assess the overall presentation outline for coherence and logical flow. Identify any areas where content or transitions between sections might be unclear or disconnected.\n2. Refine the slide content and speaker notes to ensure clarity, consistency, and adherence to the key objectives outlined at the beginning of the process.\n3. Ensure that each slide and accompanying note aligns with the defined presentation objectives, maintains audience engagement, and clearly communicates the intended message.\n4. Provide specific recommendations or modifications where improvement is needed. This may include restructuring sections, rephrasing content, or suggesting visual enhancements.\n\nPresent your final output in a structured format, including:\n- A summary review of the overall coherence and flow\n- Detailed feedback for each main section and its slides\n- Specific recommendations for improvements in clarity, engagement, and alignment with the presentation objectives.\n```\n\n### Practical Business Applications:\n\n- Use this chain to prepare impactful PowerPoint presentations for client pitches, internal proposals, or educational workshops.\n- Customize the chain by inserting your own presentation topic and keywords to match your specific business needs.\n- Tailor each section to reflect the nuances of your industry or market scenario.\n\n### Tips for Customization:\n\n- Update the variables at the beginning (`TOPIC`, `KEYWORDS`) to reflect your content.\n- Experiment with the number of sections if needed, ensuring the presentation remains focused and engaging.\n- Adjust the level of detail in slide content and speaker notes to suit your audience's preference.\n\nYou can run this prompt chain effortlessly with Agentic Workers, helping you automate your PowerPoint content creation process. It’s perfect for busy professionals who need to get presentations done quickly and efficiently.\n\n[Source](https://www.agenticworkers.com/library/cl3wcmefolbyccyyq2j7y-automated-powerpoint-content-creator)\n\nHappy presenting and enjoy your streamlined workflow!",

If anyone can share their experience, tell me the things that i need to focus more, shortcuts, etc.... We working on 8 different projects and im the only one QA, have a baby at home, so not much have time to sit 5-6 hour a day and learn, What is the fastest/productive way to become prompt engineer. Is anyone here switch QA to Prompt engineer? if so please share your journey with me 😁",

          "text": "I asked Gemini for you ...  \n\n\nThis is a dangerous position. Your director has given you a directive based on a marketing lie (\"you don't need coding knowledge\"). If you believe that lie, you will fail.\n\nAI generates code, but it often generates **broken, insecure, or hallucinated code**. If you cannot *read* the code it writes, you are like a pilot who can’t read the instrument panel—safe while the autopilot works, but dead the moment a warning light turns on.\n\nHowever, given your constraints (baby, 8 projects, no time), you cannot learn to be a traditional developer. You need a **Survival Protocol**.\n\nHere is the fastest, most productive path to meeting this demand without drowning.\n\n### Phase 1: The Reality Check (Forensic Audit)\n\n**The Trap:** Thinking \"Prompt Engineering\" is about magic words.\n\n**The Reality:** \"Prompt Engineering\" for code is actually **Technical Specification**. You don't need to know how to *write* the syntax from scratch, but you must know how to *read* the structure to tell the AI where it messed up.\n\n**Your New Role:** You are not a \"Developer.\" You are a **Code Architect & QA**.\n\n* **Developer:** Writes the loop.\n* **You:** Tells the AI *\"We need a loop here, but you missed the error handling. Fix it.\"*\n\n### Phase 2: The \"Cheat\" Toolstack (2026 Standard)\n\nDo not waste time setting up complex environments from 2020. Use the \"AI Native\" stack. This buys you speed.\n\n| Tool | Function | Why you need it |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Cursor** | The IDE (Code Editor) | It’s a fork of VS Code with AI built-in. It allows you to \"Chat with your codebase.\" **Install this immediately.** |\n| **v0.dev** | Generative UI | You type \"Login page with dark mode,\" it gives you the code. It builds the *visuals* instantly so you don't fight with CSS. |\n| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | The Brain | Currently the best model for coding. Use this inside Cursor. |\n| **Vercel** | Hosting | One-click deployment. AI builds it; Vercel puts it on the internet. |\n\n### Phase 3: The \"No-Time\" Learning Roadmap\n\nSince you cannot study 6 hours a day, you must learn by **Reverse Engineering**. You are a QA tester; use that skill. Treat the code as a \"System Under Test.\"\n\n**Week 1: Literacy (The \"Reading\" Skill)**\nDo not learn to write syntax. Learn to read it.\n\n* **Focus:** Learn what these structure blocks *look like*: `<div>` (a box), `function` (a verb/action), `import` (getting tools), `if/else` (logic).\n* **Action:** Go to a website, Right Click -> \"Inspect\". Look at the HTML. That is what you are building.\n* **Shortcut:** Ask the AI to \"Explain this code to me like I am a QA tester.\"\n\n**Week 2: The \"v0\" Workflow (Visuals)**\n\n1. Go to **v0.dev**.\n2. Prompt: *\"Create a dashboard for a QA tester with a list of 8 projects and a status bar.\"*\n3. **The trick:** It will generate code. Copy that command (`npx ...`) into your terminal in Cursor.\n4. **Result:** You have a working frontend without writing a line.\n\n**Week 3: The \"Cursor\" Workflow (Logic)**\nNow you have a pretty page that does nothing.\n\n1. Open **Cursor**.\n2. Highlight the button code.\n3. Press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K`).\n4. Type: *\"When I click this, make the status bar turn green.\"*\n5. The AI writes the logic. You verify it works.\n\n### Phase 4: The QA Advantage (Your Secret Weapon)\n\nYou have one advantage over junior developers: **You know how things break.**\n\n* **Junior Dev Prompt:** *\"Write code for a login form.\"* (Result: Weak code, no error handling).\n* **QA Prompt:** *\"Write a login form. Ensure it handles invalid emails, displays a red error message if the server is down, and prevents the user from clicking 'Submit' twice.\"*\n\nYour value isn't coding; it's **Edge Case Management**.\n\n### The \"Black Swan\" (Failure Mode)\n\nThe biggest risk is **Context Rot**.\n\n* If you keep asking the AI to \"fix this\" and \"add that\" without understanding the file structure, the code will become a tangled mess (Spaghetti Code) and stop working.\n* **Counter-measure:** Every time you add a feature, ask the AI: *\"Refactor this file to keep it clean and modular before we move on.\"*\n\n### Immediate Next Step\n\nDo this tonight (15 minutes):\n\n1. Download **Cursor** (https://www.google.com/search?q=cursor.com).\n2. Open it. Press `Cmd+L` (Chat).\n3. Type: *\"I am a QA tester with no coding background. Create a simple 'Hello World' website using React and explain how I run it on my computer step-by-step.\"*\n4. Follow the instructions.\n\nThis breaks the fear barrier.",

State what you want to accomplish and reverse engineer your process and explain it to the model. For instance, if you are stuck at a point in a development cycle, explain your problem, the steps you've already taken, what worked/what didn't and give a clear directive of what you want to accomplish. Give the model a role to assume i.e. \"You're an experienced frontend developer, with X amount experience and X disciplines achieved, tasked with solving X problem. Here's what has been accomplished (list them). Here's what still remains unresolved (list them). Here's what not to do (list anti-patterns). Here's the goal (list them). Outline a plan to resolve X issue, perform Quality Assurance on your processes and work. Log memory checkpoints at each milestone before continuing to the next step.\" This could get you started.
