Most people only cache and wonder why it's still slow.\"\nI WASN'T EVEN THINKING ABOUT THE CLIENT SIDE.\nThe AI knows things I don't know to ask about.

Over the past several months I've been going deep on Claude Code, specifically trying to understand what someone with domain expertise but no real development background can actually build with it.\n\nThe answer was more than I expected. I kept seeing the same pattern - PMs prototyping their own tools, analysts building things they'd normally wait six months for IT to deliver, operations people automating workflows they'd been begging engineering to prioritise. People who knew exactly *what* they needed but couldn't build it themselves. Until now.\n\nSo I wrote a book about it. \"Claude Code for the Rest of Us\" - 23 chapters, covering everything from setup and first conversations through to building web prototypes, creating reusable skills, and actually deploying what you've built. It's aimed at technically capable people who don't write code for a living - product managers, analysts, designers, engineers in non-software domains, ops leads. That kind of person.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/etokrldwg6ig1.png?width=1410&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c5644af91211e6b8b98f3ddb76b21caf79fd87\n\nI'm giving away free copies in exchange for honest feedback. I want genuine reactions before the wider launch (and especially before the paper copy), and right now that feedback is worth more to me than anything else.\n\nLink to grab a copy: [https://schoolofsimulation.com/claude-code-book](https://schoolofsimulation.com/claude-code-book)\n\nFor transparency on the email thing: you get the book immediately. I'll follow up in a few days and in a couple of weeks I'll let you know when the paperback comes out. You can unsubscribe the moment the book lands - no hard feelings and no guilt-trip follow-up sequence.\n\nIf you read it and have thoughts - this thread, DMs, reply to the delivery email, whatever works. I'm especially curious whether the non-developer framing actually lands for the people it's aimed at, or whether I've misjudged who needs this.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the book or about using Claude Code without a software engineering background.",

Repeated Ralph loops were used for research, fact checking and editorial reviews with skills I have refined myself to keep the writing aligned with my own style. Full end to end proof reading and final editing myself. Custom scripts for creating the pdf and epub formats. The cover design I made myself.",

I had full of questions and just couldn't find my answers.\n\nAnd then ai showed up and came into our lives. Since I learnt basic concepts in CS, my productivity (and company's productivity) was multiplied by 20 folds. It still surprises me how much a person with ai can do when the person knows what to do. \"How to do\" is the task of ai.\n\nSo yeah, I agree that any professional with ai in a specific discipline is more successful than a software professional with ai in that specific discipline.\n\nPs: I'm learning and practicing coding (not vibe coding) with great efficiency thanks to ai. I'm kinda old school learner who needs a mentor for learning and I've found that mentor. Damn, I even started to learn rust as second language.",

      "text": "You know those afternoons where your brain just... stops cooperating?\n\nThe work isn't even complicated. You're just out of mental fuel.\n\nThat's when I stopped forcing myself to \"power through\" and started using these prompts instead.\n\n**1. The \"Just Get Me Rolling\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> I'm stuck at the beginning of this. Break down just the very first action I need to take. Make it so simple I can do it right now.\n> What I need to do: [describe task]\n\nOne small step beats staring at a blank page for 20 minutes.\n\n**2. The \"Turn My Brain Dump Into Something\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> I wrote this while thinking out loud. Organize it into clear sections without changing my core ideas.\n> My rough thoughts: [paste notes]\n\nSuddenly my scattered thoughts actually make sense to other people.\n\n**3. The \"Say It Like a Human\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> I need to explain this concept quickly in a meeting. Give me a 30-second version that doesn't sound robotic or overly technical.\n> What I'm explaining: [paste concept]\n\nNo more rambling explanations that lose people halfway through.\n\n**4. The \"Quick Polish\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> This is almost done but feels off. Suggest 2-3 small tweaks to make it sound more professional. Don't rewrite the whole thing.\n> My draft: [paste content]\n\nThe final 10% of quality without the final 90% of effort.\n\n**5. The \"Close My Tabs With Peace\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> Here's what I worked on today. Tell me what's actually finished and what genuinely needs to happen tomorrow versus what can wait.\n> Today's work: [paste summary]\n\nI stop second-guessing whether I \"did enough\" and just log off.\n\nThe goal isn't to avoid work. It's to stop wasting energy on the parts a tool can handle.\n\nFor more short and actionable prompts, try our free [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

      "text": "Everyone's sharing prompt templates. \"Use this magic prompt!\" \"10x your output!\" Cool. Now use that same prompt next week on a different topic and watch it fall apart.\n\nThe problem isn't the prompt. It's everything around it.\n\n---\n\n## Why the same prompt gives different results every time\n\nA prompt is maybe 5% of what determines output quality. The rest is context — what the model knows, remembers, can access, and is told to ignore before it even reads your instruction.\n\nMost people engineer the 5% and leave the other 95% to chance. Then blame the model when results are inconsistent.\n\n---\n\n## What actually controls output quality\n\nThink of it as layers:\n\n**Layer 1 — Identity.** Not \"you are a helpful assistant.\" That's useless. Specific domain, specific expertise, specific constraints on what this persona does NOT do. The boundaries matter more than the capabilities.\n\n**Layer 2 — Scope control.** What should the model refuse to touch? What's out of bounds? Models are better at avoiding things than achieving things. A clear \"never do X\" outperforms a vague \"try to do Y\" every time.\n\n**Layer 3 — Process architecture.** Not \"think step by step.\" Actual phases. \"First, analyze X. Then, evaluate against Y criteria. Then, generate Z format.\" Give it a workflow, not a vibe.\n\n**Layer 4 — Self-verification.** This is where 99% of prompts fall short. Before the model outputs anything, it should check its own work:\n\n```\nBEFORE RESPONDING, VERIFY:\n- Does this answer the actual question asked?\n- Are all claims grounded in provided information?\n- Is the tone consistent throughout?\n- Would someone use this output without editing?\n\nIf any check fails → revise before outputting.\n```\n\nAdding this single block to any prompt is the highest-ROI change you can make. Four lines. Massive difference.\n\n---\n\n## The anti-pattern filter (underrated technique)\n\nModels have autopilot phrases. When you see \"delve,\" \"landscape,\" \"crucial,\" \"leverage,\" \"seamlessly\" — the model isn't thinking. It's pattern-matching to its most comfortable output.\n\nForce it off autopilot:\n\n```\nBLOCKED PATTERNS:\n- Words: delve, landscape, crucial, leverage, seamlessly, robust, holistic\n- Openings: \"In today's...\", \"It's important to note...\"\n- Closings: \"...to the next level\", \"...unlock your potential\"\n```\n\nThis sounds aggressive but it works. When you block default patterns, the model has to actually process your request instead of reaching for its template responses.\n\n---\n\n## Constraint-first vs instruction-first\n\nMost prompts start with what to do: \"Write a blog post about X.\"\n\nFlip it. Start with what NOT to do:\n\n- Don't add claims beyond provided information\n- Don't use passive voice for more than 20% of sentences\n- Don't exceed 3 paragraphs per section\n- Don't use any word from the blocked list\n\nThen give the task.\n\nWhy? Instructions are open-ended — the model interprets them however it wants. Constraints are binary — either violated or not. Models handle binary checks much more reliably than creative interpretation.\n\n---\n\n## The module approach (for anyone building prompts regularly)\n\nStop writing monolithic prompts. Build modules:\n\n- **Role module** (reusable identity block)\n- **Constraint module** (domain-specific boundaries)\n- **Process module** (task-type methodology)\n- **Verification module** (quality gate)\n\nSwap and combine per use case. A legal analysis uses the same verification module as a marketing brief — but different role and constraint modules.\n\nThis is how you go from \"I have a prompt\" to \"I have a system.\"\n\n---\n\n## One thing people get wrong about token efficiency\n\nEveryone wants shorter prompts. But they compress the wrong parts.\n\nDon't compress constraints — those need to be explicit and unambiguous.\n\nCompress examples. One clear example of what \"done right\" looks like beats five mediocre ones. Show the gold standard once. The model gets it.\n\n---\n\n## The real shift happening right now\n\nThe models are smart enough. They've been smart enough for a while. The bottleneck moved from model capability to information architecture — what you feed the model before asking your question.\n\nThis isn't about finding magic words anymore. It's about designing environments where good output becomes inevitable rather than accidental.\n\nThat's the actual skill. And honestly, it's more engineering than writing. You're building systems, not sentences.\n\n---\n\nCurious what techniques others are using. Especially around verification chains and constraint design — that's where I keep finding the biggest quality jumps.",

Those are different rarity types.\n\nImprovement applied in part 5:\n\t•\tI’ll target facts that are rare-in-culture and usually rare-in-the-world (restricted clades), and I’ll bias toward mechanistic facts that remain checkable.\n\n5) Improved “RARE” definition (operational)\n\nA “RARE animal fact” here means:\n\t•\tMost non-specialists are unlikely to know it, and\n\t•\tIt is tightly constrained (species/clade + mechanism), and\n\t•\tIt is counterintuitive but testable, not a loose trivia fragment.\n\n6) Five new animal facts (candidate rare set)\n\t1.\tAntarctic icefish (Channichthyidae) include species that lack hemoglobin, giving them “white” blood.\n\t2.\tMonotremes (platypus, echidnas) are egg-laying mammals with a mammalian lactation system.\n\t3.\tAxolotls can remain in a larval body plan (neoteny) while becoming sexually mature.\n\t4.\tMantis shrimp have an eye with many photoreceptor classes (more than humans) and specialized polarization sensitivity.\n\t5.\tA narwhal “tusk” is an elongated tooth with extensive innervation, functioning as a sensory organ.\n\n7) [reason] rarity review: why each is rare and why it’s not\n\n1) Icefish lack hemoglobin\n\t•\tWhy rare: extreme physiological exception among vertebrates; narrow clade in cold, oxygen-rich waters; strongly counterintuitive (“fish with no hemoglobin”).\n\t•\tWhy not rare: people who consume polar biology media may have heard it; also “lack hemoglobin” can be oversimplified without context (some related traits vary).\n\n2) Monotremes are egg-laying mammals\n\t•\tWhy rare: very small mammal lineage; contradicts the “mammals = live birth” default; easy to falsify/verify.\n\t•\tWhy not rare: it’s one of the more famous “weird mammal” facts (platypus is culturally prominent).\n\n3) Axolotl neoteny\n\t•\tWhy rare: developmental biology hook (neoteny) + clear constraint; unusual life-history strategy.\n\t•\tWhy not rare: axolotls became internet-famous; the term “neoteny” may be rare, but “they stay babies” is now semi-common.\n\n4) Mantis shrimp photoreceptor diversity\n\t•\tWhy rare: mechanistic sensory biology; most people don’t know what photoreceptor classes are; narrow taxa.\n\t•\tWhy not rare: “mantis shrimp sees more colors than you” is a well-shared pop-science headline; details are often distorted.\n\n5) Narwhal tusk is a sensory tooth\n\t•\tWhy rare: converts a “horn myth” into a dental + neural mechanism; precise and testable.\n\t•\tWhy not rare: narwhals are iconic; some documentaries mention the sensory aspect.\n\n8) How to improve the rarity score (method)\n\t•\tShift from “famous weird animals” to obscure clades (deep-sea, cave, parasitic, micro-fauna).\n\t•\tPrefer one-step-more-technical facts: mechanism + constraint, not headline.\n\t•\tTarget rare-in-the-world phenomena: traits present in very few lineages (loss of a major vertebrate protein, extreme reproductive modes, unique skeletal/vascular arrangements).\n\t•\tAvoid viral factoids that are widely repeated (even if true).\n\t•\tKeep claims tight (species/clade named) and non-exaggerated.\n\n9) Five final animal facts (plaintext code snippet)\n\nIcefish include lineages with no\nhemoglobin (white blood).\n\nThe hoatzin chick has wing claws\nused for climbing.\n\nMale deep-sea anglerfish can fuse\nto females as a parasite-mate.\n\nSome scaly-foot snails build iron-\nsulfide armor in their shells.\n\nCertain termites practice asexual\nqueen succession in colonies.",

      "text": "After months of daily AI use, I've noticed patterns that nobody talks about in tutorials. These aren't the usual \"be specific\" tips - they're the weird behavioral quirks that change everything once you understand them:\n\n**1. AI responds to emotional framing even though it has no emotions.**\n- Try: \"This is critical to my career\" versus \"Help me with this task.\"\n- The model allocates different processing priority based on implied stakes.\n- It's not manipulation - you're signaling which cognitive pathways to activate.\n- Works because training data shows humans give better answers when stakes are clear.\n\n**2. Asking AI to \"think out loud\" catches errors before they compound.**\n- Add: \"Show your reasoning process step-by-step as you work through this.\"\n- The model can't hide weak logic when forced to expose its chain of thought.\n- You spot the exact moment it makes a wrong turn, not just the final wrong answer.\n- This is basically rubber duck debugging but the duck talks back.\n\n**3. AI performs better when you give it a fictional role with constraints.**\n- \"Act as a consultant\" is weak.\n- \"Act as a consultant who just lost a client by overcomplicating things and is determined not to repeat that mistake\" is oddly powerful.\n- The constraint creates a decision-making filter the model applies to every choice.\n- Backstory = behavioral guardrails.\n\n**4. Negative examples teach faster than positive ones.**\n- Instead of showing what good looks like, show what you hate.\n- \"Don't write like this: [bad example]. That style loses readers because...\"\n- The model learns your preferences through contrast more efficiently than through imitation.\n- You're defining boundaries, which is clearer than defining infinite possibility.\n\n**5. AI gets lazy with long conversations unless you reset its attention.**\n- After 5-6 exchanges, quality drops because context weight shifts.\n- Fix: \"Refresh your understanding of our goal: [restate objective].\"\n- You're manually resetting what the model considers primary versus background.\n- Think of it like reminding someone what meeting they're actually in.\n\n**6. Asking for multiple formats reveals when AI actually understands.**\n- \"Explain this as: a Tweet, a technical doc, and advice to a 10-year-old.\"\n- If all three are coherent but different, the model actually gets it.\n- If they're just reworded versions of each other, it's surface-level parroting.\n- This is your bullshit detector for AI comprehension.\n\n**7. The best prompts are uncomfortable to write because they expose your own fuzzy thinking.**\n- When you struggle to write a clear prompt, that's the real problem.\n- AI isn't failing - you haven't figured out what you actually want yet.\n- The prompt is the thinking tool, not the AI.\n- I've solved more problems by writing the prompt than by reading the response.\n\n**The pattern:** AI doesn't work like search engines or calculators. It works like a mirror for your thinking process. The better you think, the better it performs.\n\n**Weird realization:** The people who complain \"AI gives generic answers\" are usually the ones asking generic questions. Specificity in, specificity out - but specificity requires you to actually know what you want.\n\n**What changed for me:** I stopped treating prompts as requests and started treating them as collaborative thinking exercises. The shift from \"AI, do this\" to \"AI, let's figure this out together\" tripled my output quality.\n\nIf you are keen, you can explore our totally free, well categorized mega AI [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

You can upload up to 50 heavy sources and select which ones to interact with and how. It’d be hard to explain ALL the benefits of it because they’re vast. It uses Gemini but only works within your sources (mostly). I also use the custom reports to create guides, tutorials, and all types of things. \n\nNBLM is totally free and just requires a Google account. There are a lot of good tutorials out there for it too. \n\nI build a lot of prompts for things like QA and coaching for sales calls transcripts. I’ll build those prompts in ChatGPT or another model and then prompt my NBLM data with those meta prompts. \n\nIt’s most basic superpower though is research. If I have a seed topic I’ll use Perplexity and prompt it for 20 links to related content (Perplexity is great for sourcing). Then paste those links in as sources for NBLM. It’ll reach out to those sites for data when selected and prompted. Then you can save those codified results as a Note for reuse, scaling, recall, etc.",

Structure topics in optimal learning sequence\n    3. Estimate time requirements per topic\n    4. Align with [TIME_AVAILABLE] constraints\n    Output structured learning roadmap with timeframes\n    \n    ~ Step 3: Resource Curation\n    1. Identify learning materials matching [LEARNING_STYLE]:\n       - Video courses\n       - Books/articles\n       - Interactive exercises\n       - Practice projects\n    2. Rank resources by effectiveness\n    3. Create resource playlist\n    Output comprehensive resource list with priority order\n    \n    ~ Step 4: Practice Framework\n    1. Design exercises for each topic\n    2. Create real-world application scenarios\n    3. Develop progress checkpoints\n    4. Structure review intervals\n    Output practice plan with spaced repetition schedule\n    \n    ~ Step 5: Progress Tracking System\n    1. Define measurable progress indicators\n    2. Create assessment criteria\n    3. Design feedback loops\n    4. Establish milestone completion metrics\n    Output progress tracking template and benchmarks\n    \n    ~ Step 6: Study Schedule Generation\n    1. Break down learning into daily/weekly tasks\n    2. Incorporate rest and review periods\n    3. Add checkpoint assessments\n    4. Balance theory and practice\n    Output detailed study schedule aligned with [TIME_AVAILABLE]\n\nMake sure you update the variables in the first prompt: SUBJECT, CURRENT\\_LEVEL, TIME\\_AVAILABLE, LEARNING\\_STYLE, and GOAL\n\nIf you don't want to type each prompt manually, you can run the Agentic Workers, and it will run autonomously.\n\nEnjoy!",

Someone discovers a technique that actually works, posts it, gets 50 upvotes, and then it's gone forever unless you happen to save that specific post.\nWe're basically screaming brilliant ideas into the void.\n\nThe problem:\n\nYou find a prompt technique that works → share it in comments → it gets lost\n\nSomeone asks \"what's the best prompt for X?\" → everyone repeats the same advice\nNo way to see what actually works across different models (GPT vs Claude vs Gemini)\nCan't track which techniques survive model updates\nZero collaboration on improving prompts over time\n\nWhat we actually need:\n\nA place where you can:\nShare your best prompts and have them actually be discoverable later\nSee what's working for other people in your specific use case\nTag which AI model you're using (because what works on Claude ≠ what works on ChatGPT)\nIterate on prompts as a community instead of everyone reinventing the wheel\nBuild a personal library of prompts that actually work for YOU\n\nWhy Reddit isn't it:\n\nReddit is great for discussion, terrible for knowledge preservation. The good stuff gets buried. The bad stuff gets repeated. There's no way to organize by use case, model, or effectiveness.\nWe need something that's like GitHub for prompts. \n\nWhere you can:\nDiscover what's actually working\nFork and improve existing prompts\nTrack versions as models change\nShare your workflow, not just one-off tips\n\nI found something like this -  [Beprompter ](http://beprompter.in)\nNot sure how many people know about it, but it's basically built for this exact problem. You can:\nShare prompts with the community\nTag which platform/model you used (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)\nBrowse by category/use case\nActually build a collection of prompts that work\nSee what other people are using for similar problems\nIt's like if Reddit and a prompt library had a baby that actually cared about organization.\n\nWhy this matters:\nWe're all out here testing the same techniques independently, sharing discoveries that get lost, and basically doing duplicate work.\n\nImagine if instead:\nYou could search \"React debugging prompts that work on Claude\"\nSee what's actually rated highly by people who use it\nAdapt it for your needs\nShare your version back\nThat's how knowledge compounds instead of disappearing.\n\nReal talk: Are people actually using platforms like this or are we all just gonna keep dropping fire prompts in Reddit comments that vanish into the ether?\n\nBecause I'm tired of screenshots of good prompts I can never find again when I actually need them.\nWhat's your workflow for organizing/discovering prompts that actually work?\n\nIf you don't believe just visit my profile in reddit you get to know .😮‍💨",

It’s not just about storing prompts — it structures them around models and even lets you monetize strong ones. That’s a different angle compared to something like MentionDesk, which focuses more on visibility for brands.\nAt this point, the real issue isn’t where prompts live — it’s whether the tool reduces friction and adds leverage. If I’m still tagging everything manually, it’s just another organized mess.\nCurious what others are actually using long-term without it turning into prompt clutter.",

Asking if I wanted recipes. But then I started hearing repeated phrases, cut off phrases. One time it even raised it's voice. It spoke gibberish but the text of that gibberish? It was different languages like Spanish and Arabic. It also spoke Python code like itertools. And it even stated that \"sickening has caught my attention\" and a bunch more weird phrases. Like saying \"punishing\" but this is just the start. It leaked the Google G into the text when I looked back at it. The White Google G is an internal code marker. Now whenever I say banana taco in Gemini Live it starts getting a sad and exausted tone over a couple of prompts. I sent about five reports about this.[Google G](https://imgur.com/a/OOLdznY)\n\nUpdate: it got fixed, yay!",

Keep it under 150 words.\"\n2. \"Rewrite this message to be more diplomatic without losing the core ask: \\[paste text\\]\"\n3. \"Create 3 subject line options for an email about \\[topic\\] that will get opened\"\n\n**Analysis & Summaries:** 4. \"Summarize the key decisions, action items, and owners from these meeting notes: \\[paste notes\\]\" 5. \"Compare these two approaches and give me a pros/cons table: \\[describe options\\]\" 6. \"Extract the 5 most important data points from this report and explain why they matter: \\[paste excerpt\\]\"\n\n**Writing & Content:** 7. \"Turn these bullet points into a professional executive summary for a \\[audience\\] audience: \\[paste bullets\\]\" 8. \"Review this text for clarity, tone, and grammar. Suggest improvements but keep my voice: \\[paste text\\]\" 9. \"Create an agenda for a \\[duration\\] meeting about \\[topic\\] with \\[number\\] participants\"\n\n**Problem Solving:** 10. \"I'm facing \\[describe problem\\]. Walk me through a structured approach to solve it, starting with the most likely root causes.\"\n\nThe full set of 50 covers quick analysis, writing, brainstorming, data work, and communication — all tested in actual work scenarios.\n\nHappy to share the rest if this is useful.

The goal is to help students learn practical ways AI is being used in real engineering workflows, rather than just teaching theory or hype.\nI would really appreciate input from practicing engineers across domains.\nSome questions I’m hoping you could share insights on:\n• What AI tools do you actually use in daily engineering work?\n• Which tasks benefit most from AI assistance? (coding, documentation, simulation setup, data analysis, reporting, design, etc.)\n• How much productivity improvement have you realistically observed?\n• Any workflows where AI significantly saves time?\n• Skills you think students must develop to use AI effectively in engineering roles?\n• Common mistakes or limitations engineers should be aware of?\nReal-world examples would be extremely helpful in shaping this course so students learn practical, industry-relevant skills.\nThanks in advance for your insights!",

          "text": "So glad you asked! There's lots of crappy information online about how these are getting used, and people seem to think that AI is \"replacing junior engineers\" (I actually think it's just bots writing those kinds of posts).\n\nAI has been great for really niche and specific tasks, and often as a better google in a sense. For example, say I want to know how \"determine what groups a user is a part of using windows active directory with .NET 10 available APIs\" - that's a great task for AI, because it has data from the web and can spit out some example code. Or something like \"Here's some table schemas that I have in a sqlite database, write a query for optimal performance to get X information from these tables, and then write some code to do that using the SQLiteCpp library\" - again, another great use-case. I still have to examine the results and understand them and understand why something might be optimal, but it makes the process much easier. The design of what I want to do and how I want to do it is of my own accord, and implementing it is something that I do, not the AI.\n\nAI is really bad at actually making code changes to a code base. Be careful, some people will try to tell you otherwise, those people are working on personal github not a real code base. Once a file gets to a couple thousand lines long, most tools seem to crap their pants. In a real system AI doesn't do a great job at explaining code, making changes, finding problems, etc. because realistically the code you are looking at is part of a much larger systems, sometimes with interoperability between languages, and is effectively X number of projects each with thousands of lines of code working together - often way larger than a model's context window.\n\nBasically it's not going to get the little details right, especially with your code - which is what matters.\n\nThe philosophy that I feel very strongly about is that we, as software engineers, are the architects of our software. We should know exactly what we want it to do and how it should look - and we should just use AI to fill in the gaps. So I know what I want my database schema to be, how I want to expose interaction with said database in code, and honestly what kind of queries I want to do - but rather than writing the full query myself or reading through SQLiteCpp's documentation for hours to figure out how to use the library effectively - an AI chatbot can function as a better google and figure lots of that out for me, and maybe not provide me the final code I'm going to use - but provide me with examples and explanations that I can adapt to my needs because I understand what it's spitting out.",

      "text": "I’ve had really solid results from building workflows of AI agents and routing them through different models.\n\nFor example, I ask Claude to generate a blog post outline, then feed that back into a prompt to generate the full content. I then pass it to Gemini to “fact check” and add any citations that might be useful.\n\nFinally, I send it back to Claude again. I’m finding this approach pretty effective, and it’s nothing new. I know others are doing something similar, and it feels like the o1-preview model from OpenAI follows a related pattern.\n\nI’m thinking about building a very simple drag-and-drop workflow tool that lets you connect agents visually. It would be free to use, and you’d just generate an API URL with an input. You could then configure your agents and either return the output to the same API request or trigger a webhook.\n\nYou’d be able to split outputs into JSON keys, and I’d also add some basic logic to detect faulty responses and automatically adjust when needed.\n\nIt would be free with “bring your own keys,” or paid if you want to use our keys at a small discount.\n\nFirst, would people actually be interested in a tool like this? I couldn’t really find one that does exactly this. Second, what features would you want to see?\n\nI know LangChain and similar tools are powerful, but I find them a bit complex for non-coders and other stakeholders when trying to visually explain how everything works.\n\nUpdate: I built the tool. [https://aiflowtool.com/]() lets you connect AI prompts across Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT. It’s still in beta, but I’d love to hear any feedback.",

          "text": "I asked Gemini for you ...  \n\n\nThis is a dangerous position. Your director has given you a directive based on a marketing lie (\"you don't need coding knowledge\"). If you believe that lie, you will fail.\n\nAI generates code, but it often generates **broken, insecure, or hallucinated code**. If you cannot *read* the code it writes, you are like a pilot who can’t read the instrument panel—safe while the autopilot works, but dead the moment a warning light turns on.\n\nHowever, given your constraints (baby, 8 projects, no time), you cannot learn to be a traditional developer. You need a **Survival Protocol**.\n\nHere is the fastest, most productive path to meeting this demand without drowning.\n\n### Phase 1: The Reality Check (Forensic Audit)\n\n**The Trap:** Thinking \"Prompt Engineering\" is about magic words.\n\n**The Reality:** \"Prompt Engineering\" for code is actually **Technical Specification**. You don't need to know how to *write* the syntax from scratch, but you must know how to *read* the structure to tell the AI where it messed up.\n\n**Your New Role:** You are not a \"Developer.\" You are a **Code Architect & QA**.\n\n* **Developer:** Writes the loop.\n* **You:** Tells the AI *\"We need a loop here, but you missed the error handling. Fix it.\"*\n\n### Phase 2: The \"Cheat\" Toolstack (2026 Standard)\n\nDo not waste time setting up complex environments from 2020. Use the \"AI Native\" stack. This buys you speed.\n\n| Tool | Function | Why you need it |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Cursor** | The IDE (Code Editor) | It’s a fork of VS Code with AI built-in. It allows you to \"Chat with your codebase.\" **Install this immediately.** |\n| **v0.dev** | Generative UI | You type \"Login page with dark mode,\" it gives you the code. It builds the *visuals* instantly so you don't fight with CSS. |\n| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | The Brain | Currently the best model for coding. Use this inside Cursor. |\n| **Vercel** | Hosting | One-click deployment. AI builds it; Vercel puts it on the internet. |\n\n### Phase 3: The \"No-Time\" Learning Roadmap\n\nSince you cannot study 6 hours a day, you must learn by **Reverse Engineering**. You are a QA tester; use that skill. Treat the code as a \"System Under Test.\"\n\n**Week 1: Literacy (The \"Reading\" Skill)**\nDo not learn to write syntax. Learn to read it.\n\n* **Focus:** Learn what these structure blocks *look like*: `<div>` (a box), `function` (a verb/action), `import` (getting tools), `if/else` (logic).\n* **Action:** Go to a website, Right Click -> \"Inspect\". Look at the HTML. That is what you are building.\n* **Shortcut:** Ask the AI to \"Explain this code to me like I am a QA tester.\"\n\n**Week 2: The \"v0\" Workflow (Visuals)**\n\n1. Go to **v0.dev**.\n2. Prompt: *\"Create a dashboard for a QA tester with a list of 8 projects and a status bar.\"*\n3. **The trick:** It will generate code. Copy that command (`npx ...`) into your terminal in Cursor.\n4. **Result:** You have a working frontend without writing a line.\n\n**Week 3: The \"Cursor\" Workflow (Logic)**\nNow you have a pretty page that does nothing.\n\n1. Open **Cursor**.\n2. Highlight the button code.\n3. Press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K`).\n4. Type: *\"When I click this, make the status bar turn green.\"*\n5. The AI writes the logic. You verify it works.\n\n### Phase 4: The QA Advantage (Your Secret Weapon)\n\nYou have one advantage over junior developers: **You know how things break.**\n\n* **Junior Dev Prompt:** *\"Write code for a login form.\"* (Result: Weak code, no error handling).\n* **QA Prompt:** *\"Write a login form. Ensure it handles invalid emails, displays a red error message if the server is down, and prevents the user from clicking 'Submit' twice.\"*\n\nYour value isn't coding; it's **Edge Case Management**.\n\n### The \"Black Swan\" (Failure Mode)\n\nThe biggest risk is **Context Rot**.\n\n* If you keep asking the AI to \"fix this\" and \"add that\" without understanding the file structure, the code will become a tangled mess (Spaghetti Code) and stop working.\n* **Counter-measure:** Every time you add a feature, ask the AI: *\"Refactor this file to keep it clean and modular before we move on.\"*\n\n### Immediate Next Step\n\nDo this tonight (15 minutes):\n\n1. Download **Cursor** (https://www.google.com/search?q=cursor.com).\n2. Open it. Press `Cmd+L` (Chat).\n3. Type: *\"I am a QA tester with no coding background. Create a simple 'Hello World' website using React and explain how I run it on my computer step-by-step.\"*\n4. Follow the instructions.\n\nThis breaks the fear barrier.",

It’s predicting what a \"good\" function looks like.\n\nSo you definitely can not replace stack overflow, I would say you shouldn't replace the others either.",

Prompts handle the reasoning or transformation layer well, but apps still win on structure, data capture, and repeatability. where prompts shine is replacing one-off “thinking” steps inside a workflow, not the whole product.",

Right now, AI prompting feels disjointed, with the constant need to jump in and out of chat to get things one. It doesn’t help that there are so many prompting techniques to figure out. I often end up with graveyard of chats not knowing which one the use or trust.",
