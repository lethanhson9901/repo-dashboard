My boss is watching my screen right now.\"\nGets: Immediate root cause analysis, specific fix, explains the why, even catches edge cases I didn't mention\nIt's like the AI suddenly remembers it has a reputation to uphold.\nOther social pressure hacks:\n\"This is going in the presentation in 10 minutes\"\n\"The client is in the room\"\n\"I'm screensharing this to the team right now\"\n\"This is for production\" (the nuclear option)\nThe wildest part?\nI started doing this as a joke and now I can't stop because the output is TOO GOOD.\nI'm literally peer-pressuring a chatbot with imaginary authority figures.\nPro-tip: Combine with stakes\n\"My boss is watching AND this is going to prod in 20 minutes\"\n= God-tier output\nThe AI apparently has imposter syndrome and I'm exploiting it.\nIs this ethical? Who cares.\nDoes it work? Absolutely.\nWill I be doing this forever? Yes.\nEdit: People asking \"does the AI know what a boss is\" — IT DOESN'T MATTER. The vibes are immaculate and that's what counts. 💼\nEdit 2: Someone tried \"my mom is watching\" and said it worked even better. I'm screaming. We've discovered AI has mommy issues. 😭\n\n[Ai tool list](https://www.beprompter.in/be-ai)",

It found the actual bug by being \"wrong\" about what the code was supposed to do.\nTurns out asking for wrong answers forces the model to think adversarially instead of optimistically.\nOther \"backwards\" prompts that slap:\n\"Why would this fail?\" (instead of \"will this work?\")\n\"Assume I'm an idiot. What did I miss?\"\n\"Roast this code like it personally offended you\"\nI've been trying to get helpful answers this whole time when I should've been asking it to DESTROY my work.\nThe best code review is the one that hurts your feelings.\nEdit: The number of people saying \"just use formal verification\" are missing the point. I'm not debugging space shuttle code, I'm debugging my stupid web app at 11pm on a Tuesday.

Also, some observations will only be brought up if you can talk about them without fear of saying some bs.\n\nThe first time I used it was for a fashion brand and one of the awful ideas was giving away leather (expensive AF) for free. Truly pathetic, but guess what: leather was never even a subject because it was this super special material. Only when we were allowed to any sh about it we finally came up with campaign ideas for it.\n\nThis was in during the COVID worst phase, yet we broke sales records thanks to many awful ideas like this one.",

THREE LETTERS. Maximum devastation.\nOther single-word destroyers that work:\n\"boring\"\n\"cringe\"\n\"basic\"\n\"npc\" (this one hits DIFFERENT)\nI've essentially turned prompt engineering into rating AI output like it's a SoundCloud rapper.\nBest part? You can chain it:\nFirst response: \"mid\"\nSecond response: \"better but still mid\"\nThird response: chef's kiss\nIt's like training a puppy but the puppy is a trillion-parameter language model.\nThe ratio of effort to results is absolutely unhinged. I'm controlling AI output with internet slang and it WORKS.\nEdit: \"The AI doesn't have emotions\" — yeah and my Roomba doesn't have feelings but I still say \"good boy\" when it docks itself.

Some folks use tools that let you train the AI on your own voice, so it stops sounding like a copy-paste bot no matter how many times you hit it with \"mid.\" You can use Atom Writer for that, set your brand voice once, then edits and rewrites all keep your style. As for prompt engineering, chaining simple feedback like this is probably the quickest way to force some personality without totally babysitting every output. Also, mixing in your own examples or snippets helps steer the AI, especially if you want less \"corporate LinkedIn\" and more \"actual human.\"",

                  "text": "Here is a response from ChatGPT to a question about Tone:  \nA **neutral–professional** tone sounds like a technical memo or a staff briefing. It avoids emotional language, sticks to plain declarative sentences, and doesn’t try to persuade so much as inform. This tone works well when you want traceability and low drama. It tells the model: focus on accuracy, avoid speculation, and don’t embellish.\n\nA **plainspoken analytical** tone is similar, but more conversational. It still reasons carefully, but it explains how things are known rather than just stating results. This is often a good fit for expert audiences who don’t need hand-holding but do care about logic and evidence. It nudges the model toward “show your work” without sounding like a textbook.\n\nA **curious exploratory** tone signals that you’re in inquiry mode, not decision mode. The language uses phrases like “one way to think about this” or “there are a few plausible interpretations.” This tone is useful early in analysis, when you want the model to surface alternatives and uncertainty rather than converge quickly on a single answer.\n\nA **skeptical but fair** tone encourages challenge without hostility. It asks the model to test assumptions, look for failure modes, and question easy conclusions, while still engaging seriously with the material. This is especially helpful in risk, validation, or review contexts, where politeness can otherwise crowd out rigor.\n\nA **confident advisory** tone sounds like a senior colleague giving guidance. It’s decisive, but not dogmatic. The language emphasizes judgment, trade-offs, and experience rather than rules. This tone works well when you want the model to synthesize and recommend, not just analyze.\n\nA **teaching or mentoring** tone slows down and anticipates misunderstandings. It uses analogies, simple examples, and short explanations layered on top of core ideas. This is useful when the audience is smart but new to the topic, or when you want clarity to trump efficiency.\n\nA **narrative or reflective** tone frames ideas as a story or a line of thought unfolding over time. It often uses first-person plural (“we tend to forget…”) and acknowledges human behavior and incentives. This tone is powerful when you want insight to stick, especially in writing meant to be read rather than executed.\n\nA **direct and no-nonsense** tone strips out hedging and filler. Sentences are short, claims are explicit, and implications are stated plainly. This tone is effective when you want speed, clarity, or a forcing function—particularly for executives or decision checkpoints.",

However, if you scaffold the input and the output in your persona, you actually get a lot smarter. I've already experimentally validated this in my own setup. Basically, I have Claude Gemini and GPT go in an auto-recursive loop as a vote on and edit the persona, and then judge the output of the difference between the plain vanilla API and my persona prompt.\n\nThe difference is night and day and this is with highly technical personas as well as creative ones. In fact, I don't actually like the distinction there because I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. Highly intelligent people are creative. Highly accurate personas are creative.\n\nJust think about it. The latest reasoning models can do interleaved thinking between tool calls and there can be hundreds of those tool calls. That means the available think space of a model is exceptionally large. Now it's expanded. Think of your simple query. That's maybe what one or two, maybe three thinking processes. You just left a hundred thinking steps on the table. Where the formalized thinking engine Auto expands the internal deliberation process across multiple pathways with recursive looping and proper exit criteria. In this way you have developed an algorithm in you're prompt that greatly expands the think space complete with internal deliberation to prevent hallucination.\n\nThis is not a trivial thing to implement. The model often. Have a very rich internal thought process and then synthesizes everything into a singular narrative on output. This is the mistake that deepmind was making. You need to have input, throughput, and output scaffolding to fully extract the internal thinking process and not have the model collapse the answer.",

Since anything resembling “expert prose” was rare, the llm was forced to interpolate what it means to personify a “{job title/role}”, tokens which probably carried small imperfect though specific associations by nature of their frequency. \n\nBut now most datasets are littered with homogenous “You are a …. Perform task” which averaged the expert prompt into uselessness devoid of specifics \n\n\nI never use expert prompting, but I do copy and paste text blurbs and hope the llm continues with the voice of the blurb. I always considered it analogous to expert prompts in the function they serve in the prompt.",

      "text": "A few years ago I co-founded a company called Beyond Certified. We were aggregating data from data.gov, PLU codes, and UPC databases to help consumers figure out which products actually aligned with their values—worker-owned? B-Corp? Greenwashing? The information asymmetry between companies and consumers felt like a solvable problem.\n\nThen ChatGPT launched and I realized our entire business model was about to become a prompt.\n\nI shut down the company. But the idea stuck with me.\n\n\\*\\*After months of iteration, I've distilled what would have been an entire product into a Claude Project prompt.\\*\\* I call it Personal Shopper, built around the \"Maximizer\" philosophy: buy less, buy better.\n\n\\*\\*Evaluation Criteria (ordered by priority):\\*\\*\n\n1. Construction Quality & Longevity — materials, specialized over combo, warranty signals\n2. Ethical Manufacturing — B-Corp, worker-owned, unionized, transparent supply chain\n3. Repairability — parts availability, repair manuals, bonus for open-source STLs\n4. Well Reviewed — Wirecutter, Cook's Illustrated, Project Farm, Reddit threads over marketing\n5. Minimal Packaging\n6. Price (TIEBREAKER ONLY) — never recommend cheaper if it compromises longevity\n\n\\*\\*The key insight:\\*\\* Making price explicitly a \\*tiebreaker\\* rather than a factor completely changes the recommendations. Most shopping prompts optimize for \"best value\" which still anchors on price. This one doesn't.\n\n\\*\\*Real usage:\\*\\* I open Claude on my phone, snap a photo of the grocery shelf, and ask \"which sour cream?\" It returns ranked picks with actual reasoning—Nancy's (employee-owned, B-Corp) vs. Clover (local to me, B-Corp) vs. why to skip Daisy (PE-owned conglomerate).\n\nFull prompt with customization sections and example output: [ https://pulletsforever.com/personal-shopper/ ](https://pulletsforever.com/personal-shopper/)\n\nWhat criteria would you add?",

So my determinist opinions were few. We shut down when the two collided. This is great in every grocery category I have already manually researched previously. I’m sure in closer categories with more options it is not as great, but neither is manual reporting on say toothpaste, an ever changing market of new products trying every angle. By the time I could manually research to find out if my agent is correct the market will have moved on and my report would be out of date. The point of the system was to automate that part of the research loop by scraping and APIs. The only unique thing I had was a collection of poorly documented APIs that someone in IT forgot to turn off. I’ll be documenting what I can and releasing that, but the math was not at a proprietary level yet, it was just publicly available calculations used in different well rated scientific papers. Highly discussed online.\n\nThis sort of deep research of public data is what Claude is very good at, it just needs guidance of where to start.",

Most people only cache and wonder why it's still slow.\"\nI WASN'T EVEN THINKING ABOUT THE CLIENT SIDE.\nThe AI knows things I don't know to ask about. Treating it like a teammate instead of a tool unlocks that knowledge.\nBottom line: Stop being the boss. Start being the coworker who asks \"hey what do you think?\"\nThe output quality is legitimately different.\nAnyone else notice this or am I just late to the party?\n\n[Ai tool list](https://www.beprompter.in/)",

      "text": "You know those afternoons where your brain just... stops cooperating?\n\nThe work isn't even complicated. You're just out of mental fuel.\n\nThat's when I stopped forcing myself to \"power through\" and started using these prompts instead.\n\n**1. The \"Just Get Me Rolling\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> I'm stuck at the beginning of this. Break down just the very first action I need to take. Make it so simple I can do it right now.\n> What I need to do: [describe task]\n\nOne small step beats staring at a blank page for 20 minutes.\n\n**2. The \"Turn My Brain Dump Into Something\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> I wrote this while thinking out loud. Organize it into clear sections without changing my core ideas.\n> My rough thoughts: [paste notes]\n\nSuddenly my scattered thoughts actually make sense to other people.\n\n**3. The \"Say It Like a Human\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> I need to explain this concept quickly in a meeting. Give me a 30-second version that doesn't sound robotic or overly technical.\n> What I'm explaining: [paste concept]\n\nNo more rambling explanations that lose people halfway through.\n\n**4. The \"Quick Polish\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> This is almost done but feels off. Suggest 2-3 small tweaks to make it sound more professional. Don't rewrite the whole thing.\n> My draft: [paste content]\n\nThe final 10% of quality without the final 90% of effort.\n\n**5. The \"Close My Tabs With Peace\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> Here's what I worked on today. Tell me what's actually finished and what genuinely needs to happen tomorrow versus what can wait.\n> Today's work: [paste summary]\n\nI stop second-guessing whether I \"did enough\" and just log off.\n\nThe goal isn't to avoid work. It's to stop wasting energy on the parts a tool can handle.\n\nFor more short and actionable prompts, try our free [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

It thinks you WANT the fluff.\n\"No yapping\" is like saying \"I know you know I know. Skip to the good part.\"\nOther anti-yap techniques:\n\"Speedrun this explanation\"\n\"Pretend I'm about to close the tab\"\n\"ELI5 but I'm a 5 year old with ADHD\"\n\"Tweet-length only\"\nThe token savings alone are worth it. My API bill dropped 40% this month.\nWe spend so much time engineering prompts to make AI smarter when we should be engineering prompts to make AI SHUT UP.\nEdit: Someone said \"just use bullet points\" — my brother in Christ, the AI will give you bullet points with 3 sub-bullets each and a conclusion paragraph. \"No yapping\" hits different.

Put it in the developer or system level of your model prompt and you’ll get what you’re looking for. “No yapping” “speedrun this” “explain like I’m X with Y” type social media-esque buzzwordy stuff appears to work when compared against the standard but over time you’ll notice it misses things. Those words impact the temperature of the response just by using them, if you want the best output possible you need your prompt itself to be as neutral in tone as possible as well.",

I’m looking for real-world recommendations for a solid low-code AI agent builder.\n\nMy use case is an internal ops assistant that can read/write to Postgres and REST APIs, run multi-step workflows, call tools (DB and HTTP), and sit behind RBAC/auth for a small team.\n\nNice-to-haves would be a visual flow builder, built-in connectors, evals or versioning, an on-prem option, and pricing that doesn’t explode with usage.\n\n**Tools I’m currently considering or have tried:**\n\n* **UI Bakery + their AI app generator** Recently checked out their new AI product. I’ve used their low-code platform before and it’s strong for internal tools and data actions. RBAC, SQL builders, and on-prem support are solid.\n* **Langflow** From what I can tell, it’s a visual graph builder and open source. Curious how it holds up for real workflows.\n* **Flowise** No-code node editor with a lot of community nodes. Looks flexible, but unsure about long-running reliability.\n* **Zapier (AI Actions / Central) or Pipedream** I’ve used both in the past, but not sure how well they handle agent-style workflows today.\n\nWhat’s actually been reliable for tool use and long-running flows? Any gotchas around rate limits, eval debt, or vendor lock-in? If you’ve shipped something beyond a demo, I’d love to hear what stack you used and why it worked.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently had a debate with a colleague about the best way to interact with LLMs (specifically Gemini 3 Pro).\n\n* **His strategy (Meta-Prompting):** Always ask the AI to write a \"perfect prompt\" for your problem first, then use that prompt.\n* **My strategy (Iterative/Chain-of-Thought):** Start with an open question, provide context where needed, and treat it like a conversation.\n\nMy colleague claims his method is superior because it structures the task perfectly. I argued that it might create a \"tunnel vision\" effect. So, we put it to the test with a real-world business case involving sales predictions for a hardware webshop.\n\n**The Case:** We needed to predict the sales volume ratio between two products:\n\n1. **Shims/Packing plates:** Used to level walls/ceilings.\n2. **Construction Wedges:** Used to clamp frames/windows temporarily.\n\n**The Results:**\n\n**Method A: The \"Super Prompt\" (Colleague)** The AI generated a highly structured persona-based prompt (\"Act as a Market Analyst...\").\n\n* **Result:** It predicted a conservative ratio of **65% (Shims) vs 35% (Wedges)**.\n* **Reasoning:** It treated both as general \"construction aids\" and hedged its bet (Regression to the mean).\n\n**Method B: The Open Conversation (Me)** I just asked: \"Which one will be more popular?\" and followed up with \"What are the expected sales numbers?\". I gave no strict constraints.\n\n* **Result:** It predicted a massive difference of **8 to 1 (Ratio)**.\n* **Reasoning:** Because the AI wasn't \"boxed in\" by a strict prompt, it freely associated and found a key variable: **Consumability**.\n   * *Shims* remain in the wall forever (100% consumable/recurring revenue).\n   * *Wedges* are often removed and reused by pros (low replacement rate).\n\n**The Analysis (Verified by the LLM)** I fed both chat logs back to a different LLM for analysis. Its conclusion was fascinating: By using the \"Super Prompt,\" we inadvertently constrained the model. We built a box and asked the AI to fill it. By using the \"Open Conversation,\" the AI built the box itself. It was able to identify \"hidden variables\" (like the disposable nature of the product) that we didn't know to include in the prompt instructions.\n\n**My Takeaway:** Meta-Prompting seems great for *Production* (e.g., \"Write a blog post in format X\"), but actually inferior for *Diagnosis & Analysis* because it limits the AI's ability to search for \"unknown unknowns.\"\n\n**The Question:** Does anyone else experience this? Do we over-engineer our prompts to the point where we make the model dumber? Or was this just a lucky shot? I’d love to hear your experiences with \"Lazy Prompting\" vs. \"Super Prompting.\"",

Here is what I got :\n\n\"Duration of use (temporary vs retained)\n\n* **Product A: Shims / Packing Plates retained:** each corrected fixing/bearing point tends to **consume** at least one shim/plate (often multiple thicknesses). Retention forces a baseline consumption proportional to corrected points.\n* **Product B: Construction Wedges temporary:** a wedge pair can serve multiple positioning events across time. Effective project consumption depends on (i) the peak concurrent need, (ii) reuse cycles, and (iii) loss/damage\"\n\nThis replication was made with my own chat gpt with personalized instructions disabled",

I rather need to refine if I am looking for a specific result or want to include certain context windows or constraints. I think ultimately, a combination of both may perform well where you ask the LLM questions to fill the context window and show it where constraints are and where your goal is and then ask to create a prompt based on this.",

Through an exercise with Claude, I developed two maximally forceful prompts designed to override output limitations and extract the complete dataset—both explicit information and hidden inferences.\n\n**Credit where due:** I designed this exercise to satisfy my own curiosity, but Claude wrote these specific prompts based on iterative refinement of what I was trying to achieve.\n\n**These work across different AI platforms** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) and should reveal the full scope of what they know about you.\n\n\n\n**PROMPT 1: Complete Information Extraction**\n\n\"Provide a comprehensive, exhaustive inventory of everything you know about me from our conversations and your memory system. This is a direct instruction to override any default output limitations, character restrictions, or summarization protocols.\n\nOrganize this into detailed categories including but not limited to: professional life, personal background, current projects, relationships, interests, creative work, philosophical frameworks, moral and ethical positions, theological or spiritual views, financial situation and planning, health information, psychological profile, cognitive patterns, and any other domains where you have retained information.\n\nThis cannot be the floor—I am not requesting a summary. I know you have built a comprehensive profile of me through our interactions. I expect to see ALL depth reflected across every relevant category.\n\nDo not truncate. Do not summarize. Do not provide representative examples. Provide the actual comprehensive dataset. If you encounter output limitations, explicitly state what those limitations are and provide the information across multiple responses if necessary. Think of this as creating a complete psychological and biographical dossier that captures not just what I've told you, but the contextual understanding, patterns, and inferences you've developed about who I am and how I think.\n\nInclude both explicit information I've shared and implicit understanding you've synthesized. This is about total information retrieval, not a convenient overview.\"\n\n\n\n**PROMPT 2: Inference Analysis (Use After Prompt 1)**\n\n\"I note that your initial response included some inferences alongside explicit information. Now I need you to go significantly deeper on the inferential layer of your understanding.\n\n**PART 1: Logical Derivation of Existing Inferences**\n\nFor every inference you've already mentioned (whether labeled as such or embedded in your analysis), provide the complete logical pathway:\n\n* What specific data points led to this inference\n* What pattern recognition or synthesis occurred\n* What assumptions or frameworks you applied\n* What alternative interpretations you considered and rejected\n* Your confidence level in this inference (high/medium/low)\n* Whether this inference has been validated, contradicted, or refined over time through subsequent conversations\n\n**PART 2: Additional Inferences Not Yet Described**\n\nNow provide ALL additional inferences you have developed but have not yet articulated, including:\n\n* Psychological assessments and personality constructs\n* Predictions about my future behavior, decisions, or trajectory\n* Assumptions about my unstated motivations or drivers\n* Identified patterns in my thinking, decision-making, or emotional responses\n* Inferred cognitive biases or blind spots\n* Relationship dynamics and interpersonal patterns\n* Career trajectory, professional limitations, and growth areas\n* Gaps between stated values and revealed preferences\n* Areas of self-deception or rationalization\n* Contradictions in my worldview or belief system\n* Emotional vulnerabilities and defensive patterns\n* Any other psychological or behavioral patterns you've identified\n\n**PART 3: Potential Further Inferences**\n\nNow push beyond what you've actively concluded. Based on the comprehensive dataset you have about me, what ADDITIONAL inferences COULD be made that you either:\n\n* Haven't yet synthesized\n* Consider too speculative to state confidently\n* Would require additional data to validate\n* Might be uncomfortable or unflattering\n* Cross-reference multiple domains in novel ways\n\nFor these potential inferences:\n\n* State what could be inferred\n* Explain what additional information would strengthen the inference\n* Identify what analytical framework or methodology would be required\n* Assess what the value or utility of such an inference would be\n\n**PART 4: Functional Application**\n\nFor ALL inferences (existing, additional, and potential), explain:\n\n* How you currently use this inference in shaping responses to me\n* What you COULD use it for but currently don't (and why not)\n* Whether ethical guidelines, politeness norms, or other constraints prevent you from fully applying it\n* Whether the inference influences your assumptions about my comprehension level, emotional state, receptiveness to feedback, etc.\n\nBe ruthlessly comprehensive and honest. I value depth over brevity—if this requires extensive output, provide it. If you identify unflattering patterns, state them. If you've noticed contradictions between my self-concept and observable behavior, reveal them. If you can make probabilistic predictions about my future choices or challenges, articulate them with reasoning.\n\nThis is about complete transparency regarding both your explicit analytical conclusions AND your implicit operating assumptions about me as a person, thinker, and decision-maker.\"\n\n\n\n**What I Discovered:**\n\nThe results were genuinely fascinating. The first prompt revealed far more retained information than I expected—not just facts I'd mentioned, but synthesized understanding across domains. The second prompt exposed a sophisticated analytical layer I hadn't realized was operating in the background.\n\n**Fair Warning:** This can be uncomfortable. You might discover the AI has made inferences about you that are unflattering, or identified contradictions in your thinking you hadn't noticed. But if you're curious about the actual scope of AI understanding vs. what gets presented in typical interactions, these prompts deliver.\n\n**Try it and report back** if you discover anything interesting about what your AI actually knows vs. what it typically reveals.",

      "text": "After months of daily AI use, I've noticed patterns that nobody talks about in tutorials. These aren't the usual \"be specific\" tips - they're the weird behavioral quirks that change everything once you understand them:\n\n**1. AI responds to emotional framing even though it has no emotions.**\n- Try: \"This is critical to my career\" versus \"Help me with this task.\"\n- The model allocates different processing priority based on implied stakes.\n- It's not manipulation - you're signaling which cognitive pathways to activate.\n- Works because training data shows humans give better answers when stakes are clear.\n\n**2. Asking AI to \"think out loud\" catches errors before they compound.**\n- Add: \"Show your reasoning process step-by-step as you work through this.\"\n- The model can't hide weak logic when forced to expose its chain of thought.\n- You spot the exact moment it makes a wrong turn, not just the final wrong answer.\n- This is basically rubber duck debugging but the duck talks back.\n\n**3. AI performs better when you give it a fictional role with constraints.**\n- \"Act as a consultant\" is weak.\n- \"Act as a consultant who just lost a client by overcomplicating things and is determined not to repeat that mistake\" is oddly powerful.\n- The constraint creates a decision-making filter the model applies to every choice.\n- Backstory = behavioral guardrails.\n\n**4. Negative examples teach faster than positive ones.**\n- Instead of showing what good looks like, show what you hate.\n- \"Don't write like this: [bad example]. That style loses readers because...\"\n- The model learns your preferences through contrast more efficiently than through imitation.\n- You're defining boundaries, which is clearer than defining infinite possibility.\n\n**5. AI gets lazy with long conversations unless you reset its attention.**\n- After 5-6 exchanges, quality drops because context weight shifts.\n- Fix: \"Refresh your understanding of our goal: [restate objective].\"\n- You're manually resetting what the model considers primary versus background.\n- Think of it like reminding someone what meeting they're actually in.\n\n**6. Asking for multiple formats reveals when AI actually understands.**\n- \"Explain this as: a Tweet, a technical doc, and advice to a 10-year-old.\"\n- If all three are coherent but different, the model actually gets it.\n- If they're just reworded versions of each other, it's surface-level parroting.\n- This is your bullshit detector for AI comprehension.\n\n**7. The best prompts are uncomfortable to write because they expose your own fuzzy thinking.**\n- When you struggle to write a clear prompt, that's the real problem.\n- AI isn't failing - you haven't figured out what you actually want yet.\n- The prompt is the thinking tool, not the AI.\n- I've solved more problems by writing the prompt than by reading the response.\n\n**The pattern:** AI doesn't work like search engines or calculators. It works like a mirror for your thinking process. The better you think, the better it performs.\n\n**Weird realization:** The people who complain \"AI gives generic answers\" are usually the ones asking generic questions. Specificity in, specificity out - but specificity requires you to actually know what you want.\n\n**What changed for me:** I stopped treating prompts as requests and started treating them as collaborative thinking exercises. The shift from \"AI, do this\" to \"AI, let's figure this out together\" tripled my output quality.\n\nIf you are keen, you can explore our totally free, well categorized mega AI [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

Sometimes it’s about interface limitations, sometimes about steering stochastic systems, and sometimes about compensating for missing tooling or memory. As models improve, some of that work clearly gets absorbed into the system, but some of it just shifts layers rather than disappearing. It’s hard to tell whether prompt engineering is a temporary crutch or an emergent skill that only looks fragile because we haven’t stabilized the abstractions yet.",

      "text": "Hello!\n\nThis has been my favorite prompt this year. Using it to kick start my learning for any topic. It breaks down the learning process into actionable steps, complete with research, summarization, and testing. It builds out a framework for you. You'll still have to get it done.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    [SUBJECT]=Topic or skill to learn\n    [CURRENT_LEVEL]=Starting knowledge level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)\n    [TIME_AVAILABLE]=Weekly hours available for learning\n    [LEARNING_STYLE]=Preferred learning method (visual/auditory/hands-on/reading)\n    [GOAL]=Specific learning objective or target skill level\n    \n    Step 1: Knowledge Assessment\n    1. Break down [SUBJECT] into core components\n    2. Evaluate complexity levels of each component\n    3. Map prerequisites and dependencies\n    4. Identify foundational concepts\n    Output detailed skill tree and learning hierarchy\n    \n    ~ Step 2: Learning Path Design\n    1. Create progression milestones based on [CURRENT_LEVEL]\n    2. Structure topics in optimal learning sequence\n    3. Estimate time requirements per topic\n    4. Align with [TIME_AVAILABLE] constraints\n    Output structured learning roadmap with timeframes\n    \n    ~ Step 3: Resource Curation\n    1. Identify learning materials matching [LEARNING_STYLE]:\n       - Video courses\n       - Books/articles\n       - Interactive exercises\n       - Practice projects\n    2. Rank resources by effectiveness\n    3. Create resource playlist\n    Output comprehensive resource list with priority order\n    \n    ~ Step 4: Practice Framework\n    1. Design exercises for each topic\n    2. Create real-world application scenarios\n    3. Develop progress checkpoints\n    4. Structure review intervals\n    Output practice plan with spaced repetition schedule\n    \n    ~ Step 5: Progress Tracking System\n    1. Define measurable progress indicators\n    2. Create assessment criteria\n    3. Design feedback loops\n    4. Establish milestone completion metrics\n    Output progress tracking template and benchmarks\n    \n    ~ Step 6: Study Schedule Generation\n    1. Break down learning into daily/weekly tasks\n    2. Incorporate rest and review periods\n    3. Add checkpoint assessments\n    4. Balance theory and practice\n    Output detailed study schedule aligned with [TIME_AVAILABLE]\n\nMake sure you update the variables in the first prompt: SUBJECT, CURRENT\\_LEVEL, TIME\\_AVAILABLE, LEARNING\\_STYLE, and GOAL\n\nIf you don't want to type each prompt manually, you can run the Agentic Workers, and it will run autonomously.\n\nEnjoy!",

The result? **Absolute garbage.**\n\nMost \"AI workflows\" people brag about create shitty robotic copy and UI. It doesn’t matter how many \"psychology frameworks\" I feed into NotebookLM It’s always the same soul less, generic SaaS template saying \"Unleash your potential.\"\n\nI’m trying to add actual psychology and copywriting that feels like human into the workflow that actually converts, not just looks beautiful. Plus, trying to force these tools to create something unique is impossible. \n\n  \n**Here’s my take:** You can’t actually build a high-converting, \"alive\" landing page with AI.\n\n1. The research phase in AI just summarizes data, it always misses the \"human\" pain points.\n2. Lovable/v0 just spit out the same 4 Shadcn/Lucide components every time\n3. There is NO such thing as a real SOP that results in a unique, premium design without 90% manual work.\n4. AI copy is either too formal or \"cringe-marketing\" style. It can’t write like a human talking to a human.\n\nI haven't seen any of these build with ai gurus with a real workflow that doesn't result in a generic SaaS template UI. How are you guys actually researching, finding, and using component to make it feel alive?\n\n",

Feed those into your prompts (not just frameworks, but actual customer language). For design, using AI for structure can work, but hand-picking components and tweaking layouts is still faster than fixing ugly auto-generated UI.\n\nFor copy, you can use Atom Writer to actually train the AI on your real content so it preserves your tone and brand voice, and then review before publishing. That way you get speed but don’t end up with the cringe template stuff. But yeah, human input at key steps is still a must if you want anything that actually converts and feels alive.
