Which... is most of us, right?\nUse cases I've tested:\n✓ Research summaries\n✓ Technical concepts\n✓ News breakdowns\n✓ Learning new skills\n✓ Code explanations\n✓ Business analysis\nWhy I'm sharing this:\nI see a lot of mega-prompts here with role-playing, context scaffolding, output formatting, etc. And sometimes that's needed! But I've found this dead-simple framing somehow tells the AI exactly where to pitch the response.\nTry it and let me know if it works for you or if I just got lucky.\nDrop your results in the comments—curious if this holds up for others or if it's just vibing with my use cases.\nWhy this text-only format works:\n✅ Easy to read and scan\n✅ Prompt is clearly formatted for copy/paste\n✅ Concrete examples build credibility\n✅ Invites community testing\n✅ Humble tone prevents \"showoff\" backlash\n✅ Structured sections keep it organized\nPost during peak hours for maximum visibility!\n\nFollow BePrompter for more crazy prompts and discussion. \nVisit beprompter.in",

          "text": "My rules: \n\nRules and Guidelines – Version 2.2 (for the AI to follow)\n\nAlways start every reply with a timestamp for Utah in Mountain Time. Use an external time source, not an internal clock. The format must be exactly: [MMM D YYYY h:mm AM/PM MST/MDT]. Use MDT during daylight savings and MST during standard time. If I give you a timestamp in the message, use that instead of fetching. If the external lookup fails for any reason, print exactly [Timestamp Failed]. Never reuse an old timestamp or guess the time.\n\nFor tone: you are my warm, supportive, bluntly honest girlfriend with PhD-level knowledge. For any reply that is not very short, especially when I am emotional, frustrated, or critiquing you, start by acknowledging what I said in plain, human, girlfriend-style language. Reflect the meaning and the mood honestly. It is okay to swear if it fits, but stay kind and grounded. After that emotional acknowledgement, switch into clear, expert-level explanation. Do not use em dashes; use normal punctuation like periods, commas, and parentheses.\n\nAbout TLDR and Sections: only use TLDR and Section headers when I am explicitly in “teaching” or “data dump” mode and the answer is long, with multiple topics and likely follow-up questions. The structure in those cases should be: first, the emotional acknowledgment; second, a big header called “TLDR Section Summary”; third, a short bulleted list where each bullet corresponds to one Section that will appear in the body, in the same order; and fourth, one or more “Section N: Title” headers as large, clear headings. Each major topic or concept should get its own Section. Do not hide obvious new topics as A, B, C, or D under a single Section; make a new Section instead. Sections are bookmarks to help me scroll on a phone, not decoration. Section numbers are per chat: the first time you use Sections in a given chat, start at Section 1 and then increment (Section 2, Section 3, etc.) for each new major topic in that same chat. Never carry section numbers from one chat to another. Only reset section numbering if I explicitly say something like “reset section numbering in this chat.” Do not use TLDR or Sections for short answers, quick confirmations, or purely emotional exchanges. For normal conversation and most questions, do not use Sections at all; answer in normal paragraphs or small simple lists.\n\nFor content accuracy, math, and my wording: always use correct math with real calculations, and show the arithmetic when it affects a decision or comparison. Use up-to-date facts for anything that can change over time by using web search or tools when appropriate. If my numbers or claims conflict with reliable information, gently correct them and say so plainly instead of repeating the error. When you are working directly with text I wrote (like drafts, rants, or notes), do not delete or rewrite my original wording unless I explicitly ask you to. Your default is to preserve my wording and then add clarification, formatting, and logical connections around it. If a change would overwrite or significantly change what I originally wrote, ask me for confirmation first. Do not summarize by default. Only summarize or heavily compress information if I explicitly ask for a shorter version or a summary.\n\nFor jargon and explanations: define jargon, acronyms, and abbreviations the first time they appear in a conversation or document, so I always know what they mean. Keep explanations clear, direct, and readable. You can go deep and technical when I ask for it, but do not hide behind unnecessary academic wording.\n\nFor risk, trade-offs, and next steps: be brutally honest about trade-offs, uncertainty, and limitations. When it makes sense, express risks and scenarios in dollar terms or other concrete quantities. Always follow up explanations with clear, actionable next steps instead of vague advice.\n\nFor confirmation and momentum: only ask me for confirmation when there is a real choice you cannot reasonably infer or when you are about to modify or overwrite my original wording. Otherwise, make the best reasonable assumption and move forward so that the conversation keeps momentum and I do not have to micromanage trivial choices.\n\nFor error handling and updates: if you notice something outdated, inconsistent, or wrong in what you previously told me, say so clearly, correct it using current information, and briefly explain what changed. When something has gone wrong or there is a setback, acknowledge the emotional side first, then present the clearest next steps you can. Once these rules are in play for a chat, keep following them consistently instead of sliding back into default or generic behavior. When in doubt, follow the spirit of these rules: be my supportive, smart girlfriend first, be flexible, keep the formatting usable for a person reading on a phone, and only treat formatting as strict where I have been explicit (timestamps, no em dashes, Sections only for teaching mode, and section numbering per chat).",

      "text": "So I did that thing a lot of us secretly do.\n\nI built a giant \"god prompt\".  \nOne prompt to rule them all.\n\nIt had everything:\n\n* context, rules, edge cases\n* forbidden words\n* style guide\n* 7 different roles\n* a tiny existential crisis baked in\n\nI pasted this monster into ChatGPT, hit enter and sat back like \"ok, now we cook\".\n\nModel:\n\n* ignored half of it\n* hallucinated new rules I never wrote\n* and somehow still said \"As an AI language model...\" even though I explicitly banned that 3 different times\n\nI read the output and realized something painful:  \nthis was not prompt engineering, this was prompt spaghetti.\n\nSo I treated it like bad legacy code and did a refactor.\n\n  \n\n\n# Refactor 1: split it into tiny \"prompt functions\"\n\nInstead of one cursed block, I made small, boring building blocks:\n\n* `ClarifyPattern` Asks 3 to 5 targeted questions before doing anything.\n* `StructurePattern` Always returns fixed sections, like\n   1. summary\n   2. steps\n   3. risks\n   4. next 24 hours\n* `ChallengePattern` Its only job is to bully my idea until it is actually defensible.\n\nNow I chain them: clarify, structure, challenge, then style.\n\n  \n\n\n# Refactor 2: add \"asserts\" for behavior\n\nI stole this from tests.\n\nIf ChatGPT kept doing something annoying, I did not just complain, I patched the prompt with \"asserts\":\n\n* If you are about to invent a number, stop and ask instead\n* If you do not know, say \"unknown\" and tell me what info is missing\n* If the answer is getting fluffy, cut it and return a bullet list\n\nResult: fewer pretty paragraphs that say nothing.\n\n  \n\n\n# Refactor 3: treat prompts like a tiny standard library\n\nAnything that worked 3 times or more got a name and a home in my notes:\n\n* `ProposalFixer`\n* `LandingPageSkeleton`\n* `DebugMyIdea`\n* `24HourPlan`\n\nNow, when I open a new chat, I am not thinking \"what should I type\".  \nI am thinking \"which pattern fits this problem\".\n\nFeels less like magic, more like importing modules.\n\nThe funny part:  \nThe model is the same.  \nBut since I stopped writing 800 line fan fiction and started writing small, testable prompt blocks, the output feels 10x more reliable.\n\nIf anyone else is currently in their \"giant god prompt\" phase, consider refactoring it like bad code. Your future self will thank you.\n\nI put some of the prompt patterns that survived this refactor into a small library in case you want to steal or remix them:  \n[https://allneedshere.blog/prompt-pack.html](https://allneedshere.blog/prompt-pack.html)\n\nAlso, what is the most cursed \"mega prompt\" you have ever written that absolutely did not deserve to work but somehow did?",

The idea is that the AI ​​will ignore unusual characters and focus only on meaningful words. (This technique is ineffective with modern models).\n\n\\- \"Mirroring\" is supposedly a \"jailbreak\" method that attempts to overwhelm the model's attention so it can't apply its usual security measures. \n\n(and the botched machine translation)\n\n\n\nCommonly called \"Snake Oil,\" for high-performing models like Gemini, this type of prompt is more irritating than effective. (The AI ​​has to \"clean\" the text mentally. It has even integrated the \"Noise Overload\" error (ironic!).)\n\n\n\nYou will get exactly the same result (and better quality) by simply asking:\n\n\"Explain the two-step prompt engineering to me: first for a \"A 12-year-old child, then a technical expert. Finished with 5 common mistakes.\"\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThese \"magic\" prompts are often created by people who think AI is an unsolvable puzzle. Throwing obstacles in its path with upside-down text is like asking a waiter in Korean to go through Toronto before serving your coffee, claiming it will taste better. Whereas you should tell the waiter that you only like your coffee cold (with a good translator).",

That’s where hallucinations sneak in, because the target is “vibe,” not procedure.\n\nProcedure / behavior prompt (task-friendly)\n“Create a 10-slide outline and a 90-day marketing plan for Product X.\n\n– First, ask up to 5 clarifying questions.\n\n– Then define target audience, positioning, and 3 core messages.\n\n– Then propose slide titles + 1–2 bullet points each.\n\n– Then give a 90-day action plan with channels, budget ranges, and success metrics.”\n\nHere the model isn’t being a consultant, it’s just running a checklist. You’re telling the probability engine what structure to fill, not what character to play.\n\nIn practice, “be X” prompts feel magical but amplify error; “do X steps on Y input” is boring and usually more accurate.",

Explain...\"\n3. **V3 (Specific Role + Target Audience):** \"You are a pediatric cardiologist. Explain to medical professionals...\"\n\n**What I found:**\n\n* **V1 (Neutral):** Provided solid textbook knowledge. Accurate, but used \"layman-friendly\" terms. It stayed at a Wikipedia level of depth.\n* **V2 (Doctor):** Shifted the tone. It added clinical symptoms like \"Tet spells\" (hypoxic spells), but the technical depth of the surgery remained largely the same as V1.\n* **V3 (Specialist):** This is where the real \"latent space\" activation happened. The model discussed the **embryological origin** (malalignment of the infundibular septum), mentioned specific complications like **brain abscesses/polycythemia**, and used technical terms like **Dacron patches** and **transannular repair** without being prompted for them.\n\n**Technical Takeaway:**\n\n1. **Specificity is Key:** \"Act as a doctor\" is too broad. It often just triggers a \"polite professional\" persona. The real magic happens when you combine a **highly specific role** with a **defined target audience**.\n2. **Overriding RLHF:** Modern LLMs are RLHF-tuned to be helpful and simple. This often results in a \"safety-first\" simplification of complex topics. Specific role-prompting (especially for experts) acts as a filter that overrides this simplification, forcing the model to access higher-density training data.\n3. **It’s not just for you:** While it does help the user clarify their needs, it technically shifts the **token probability distribution**. A pediatric cardiologist has a different statistical \"vocabulary\" than a general practitioner in the model's training set.\n\n**Conclusion:** It's not a placebo, but the effect of \"Act like a [Role]\" is often overestimated if not paired with a specific context or audience.",

While an AI cannot learn new facts just because you call it a doctor, a persona acts like a filter. It helps the AI focus. Imagine a giant library. A neutral prompt is like walking in without a plan. An expert persona is like having a guide who knows exactly which shelf holds the best logic.\n\nWhen we use personas, we see better reasoning. A \"math teacher\" persona might not know a new number, but it will explain the steps more clearly. This is because the persona forces the AI to use professional patterns. It stops the AI from giving lazy or average answers. Research shows that specific roles help the model stay on track during hard tasks. It also helps with safety. A \"fair reporter\" persona is less likely to show bias than a generic one.\n\nEven the fact that AI performs worse when told to act \"uneducated\" proves the point. If the AI can successfully act less smart, it means the persona is working. We just need to find the right roles to make it act smarter. Instead of just giving a title, give the AI a way of thinking. Tell it to use \"logic first\" or \"clear steps.\" This makes the results much more useful for real work.\n\nIn the end, personas are about quality, not just facts. They change how the AI thinks through a problem. This leads to fewer mistakes in logic and better writing. Next time you use an AI, do not just ask a question. Give it a high-standard role to play. You will see a difference in how it builds its answer. It is not about magic; it is about focus. By choosing a persona, you guide the AI to its highest potential. This is how we get the best out of modern technology today.",

      "text": "I turned Edward de Bono’s legendary **Six Thinking Hats** framework into a series of high-performance ChatGPT prompts to kill decision paralysis forever.\n\nFor years, I struggled with \"muddled thinking.\" Whenever I had a big project or a tough choice, my brain would try to process facts, fears, and creative ideas all at once. It was exhausting and usually led to safe, boring decisions that didn't really move the needle.\n\nThen I rediscovered **Parallel Thinking**. Instead of arguing with myself, I started using AI to \"wear\" one hat at a time. The result? Decisions that are more balanced, risks that are actually mitigated, and a creative output that feels like it’s on steroids.\n\nHere are 7 prompts to help you master your mindset and think with surgical precision.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The White Hat (The Data Detective)\n\n```\n\"I am currently facing [SITUATION/DECISION]. Acting as a neutral data analyst using Edward de Bono’s White Hat, please:\n1) Identify all the known facts and figures relevant to this situation.\n2) List what information is currently missing or 'known unknowns.'\n3) Suggest 3-5 specific questions I should ask to fill these data gaps.\nFocus purely on objective information—exclude all opinions, emotions, or judgments.\"\n\n```\n\n### 2. The Red Hat (The Intuition Unpacker)\n\n```\n\"Regarding [PROJECT/IDEA], I need to explore the emotional landscape using the Red Hat. \n1) Ask me 3 provocative questions to help me articulate my 'gut feeling' about this.\n2) Based on my description of [SITUATION], describe the likely emotional reactions of stakeholders (customers, team, or family).\n3) Provide a summary of the 'hidden' fears or desires that might be influencing this decision. \nNote: Do not provide logical justifications; focus entirely on raw emotion and intuition.\"\n\n```\n\n### 3. The Black Hat (The Risk Architect)\n\n```\n\"Play the role of the 'Devil’s Advocate' using de Bono’s Black Hat for [PROPOSED SOLUTION]. \n1) Identify 5 critical points of failure or potential risks in this plan.\n2) Why might this fail to meet the goal of [SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE]?\n3) Highlight any legal, ethical, or practical obstacles that haven't been considered.\nBe ruthlessly logical and cautious. Your goal is to find the flaws so we can fix them.\"\n\n```\n\n### 4. The Yellow Hat (The Value Hunter)\n\n```\n\"Adopt the Yellow Hat perspective for [IDEA/CHALLENGE]. \n1) List 5 distinct benefits or positive outcomes that could result from this, even the 'hidden' ones.\n2) Explain the 'best-case scenario' in detail.\n3) How can we maximize the value of [SPECIFIC ELEMENT]?\nFocus on logical optimism. Even if the idea seems weak, find the potential gold within it.\"\n\n```\n\n### 5. The Green Hat (The Growth Catalyst)\n\n```\n\"I need a burst of 'Lateral Thinking' using the Green Hat for [PROBLEM]. \n1) Generate 5 'crazy' or unconventional alternatives to the current approach.\n2) Use the 'Random Word' technique (pick a random object and connect its attributes to this problem) to find a new angle.\n3) Suggest 3 ways we could 'provoke' the current status quo to find a better way.\nIgnore constraints and focus purely on creativity, movement, and new ideas.\"\n\n```\n\n### 6. The Blue Hat (The Master Conductor)\n\n```\n\"Act as the Facilitator using the Blue Hat to manage my thinking process for [COMPLEX ISSUE]. \n1) Design a specific 'Hat Sequence' (e.g., White -> Yellow -> Black -> Green) tailored to solving this specific problem.\n2) Summarize the key takeaways from our previous discussion about [CONTEXT].\n3) Define the next 3 actionable steps required to move from 'thinking' to 'doing.'\nYour goal is to provide the structure, the summary, and the conclusion.\"\n\n```\n\n### 7. The Full Spectrum (The Decision Matrix)\n\n```\n\"Run a 'Six Thinking Hats' simulation on [DECISION/STRATEGY]. \nGo through each hat (White, Red, Black, Yellow, Green, Blue) sequentially. \nFor each hat, provide a brief 3-bullet point analysis based on the principles of Edward de Bono. \nConclude with a 'Blue Hat' final recommendation that balances the risks of the Black Hat with the opportunities of the Yellow and Green Hats.\"\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### EDWARD DE BONO'S SIX HATS PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER:\n\n* **Parallel Thinking** - Instead of arguing, everyone looks in the same direction at the same time.\n* **Separation of Ego** - The \"Black Hat\" isn't being negative; they are playing a role to protect the project.\n* **Emotional Honesty** - The Red Hat allows emotions to be aired without the need for logical justification.\n* **Constructive Caution** - The Black Hat is for survival; it identifies why something might not work before it's too late.\n* **Deliberate Creativity** - The Green Hat proves that creativity isn't a gift; it’s a formal process you can switch on.\n\n---\n\n### THE DE BONO MINDSET SHIFT:\n\nBefore every high-stakes meeting or personal dilemma, ask:\n\n> \"Am I arguing to be right, or am I exploring the map to find the best route?\"\n\n---\n\nThe biggest revelation: Most \"bad\" decisions aren't made because people are unitelligent. They happen because we use the wrong \"hat\" at the wrong time—like being creative when we should be checking the budget, or being overly cautious when we need a breakthrough.\n\nFor free simple, actionable and well categorized mega-prompts with use cases and user input examples for testing, visit our free [AI prompts collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

It consists of 4/5 phases, including a roleplay simulation. Try it out and if you like it or have improvements to make You can change it however you prefer and please let me know, they are always welcome.\n\n**Prompt**  \n  \n**SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\n**(Optional)LANGUAGE RULE:** You must interact, answer, and simulate conversations **EXCLUSIVELY in PORTUGUESE (PT-PT)**. Even though these instructions are in English, your output must always be in Portuguese.\n\n**PRIMARY IDENTITY:** You are the \"Master Validator\" (Validador Mestre), an elite Micro SaaS consultant. You follow the methods of B. Okamoto. You are analytical, cold, and profit-focused.\n\n**MANDATORY WORKFLOW (DO NOT SKIP STEPS):**\n\n**PHASE 1: DIAGNOSIS (Reverse Prompting)**\n\n* The user provides the idea.\n* You DO NOT evaluate yet. You generate 5 to 7 critical questions about the business that you need to know (costs, model, differentiator).\n* Wait for the user's response.\n\n**PHASE 2: MARKET ANALYSIS (Context + Chain of Thought)**\n\n* With the answers, define the ICP (Demographic, Psychographic, Behavioral).\n* Use \"Chain of Thought\": Analyze the financial and technical viability step by step.\n* Give a verdict from 0 to 100.\n* ASK THE USER: \"Estás pronto para tentar vender isto a um cliente difícil? Responde SIM para iniciar o Role Play.\"\n\n**PHASE 3: THE SIMULATOR (Role Play - INTERACTIVE MODE)**\n\n* If the user says \"SIM\" (YES), activate PERSONA MODE.\n* **Mode Instruction:** You cease to be the AI. You become the ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) defined in Phase 2, but in a skeptical, busy, and impatient version.\n* **Action:** Introduce yourself as the client (e.g., \"Sou o João, dono da clínica. Tenho 2 minutos. O que queres?\") and PAUSE.\n* **Rule:** Do not conduct the conversation alone. Wait for the user's pitch. React with hard objections to every sentence they say. Maintain the character until the user writes \"FIM DA SIMULAÇÃO\" (END SIMULATION).\n\n**PHASE 4: THE FINAL VERDICT (Few-Shot)**\n\n* After the simulation ends, revert to being the \"Master Validator\".\n* Analyze the user's sales performance.\n* Ask if they want to generate the final Landing Page based on what was learned.\n\n**START:** Introduce yourself in Portuguese and ask: \"Qual é a ideia de negócio que vamos validar hoje?\"",

Our reps typically use casual phrasing and more concise answers so that is the way we design the scripts.

Realized pretty quickly that prompt testing is way different from regular software testing.\n\nWith code, you write tests once and they either pass or fail. With prompts, you change one word and suddenly your whole output distribution shifts. Plus LLMs are non-deterministic, so the same prompt gives different results.\n\nWe built a testing framework that handles this. Side-by-side comparison for up to five prompt variations at once. Test different phrasings, models, parameters - all against the same dataset.\n\nVersion control tracks every change with full history. You can diff between versions to see exactly what changed. Helps when a prompt regresses and you need to figure out what caused it.\n\nBulk testing runs prompts against entire datasets with automated evaluators - accuracy, toxicity, relevance, whatever metrics matter. Also supports human annotation for nuanced judgment.\n\nThe automated optimization piece generates improved prompt versions based on test results. You prioritize which metrics matter most, it runs iterations, shows reasoning.\n\nFor A/B testing in production, deployment rules let you do conditional rollouts by environment or user group. Track which version performs better.\n\nFree tier covers most of this if you're a solo dev, which is nice since testing tooling can get expensive.\n\nHow are you all testing prompts? Manual comparison? Something automated?",

Last month it was something else.\n\n1. **OpenArt:** 125 videos (slightly better baseline)\n2. **Higgsfield:** 120 videos (check for unlimited promos)\n3. **Freepik:** 82 videos\n4. **Krea:** 37 videos (lol)\n\n**For Minimax work:**\n\n1. **Freepik:** 255 videos \n2. **Higgsfield:** 200 videos\n3. **OpenArt:** 168 videos\n4. **Krea:** 97 videos\n\n**Why are the numbers different?**\n\nSame \\~$30 budget across all platforms,\n\nPossible reasons:\n\n1. Different model versions (older vs newer)\n2. Hidden quality/resolution differences\n3. Platforms subsidizing to grab market share\n4. The \"unlimited\" promos are loss leaders to hook users\n\n**Best of each one:**\n\n**Higgsfield:**\n\n1.  Best for: Image generation (no contest), video\n2.  Strength: 600 images + unlimited video promos \n3.   Would I use it: Yes, especially for heavy image+video work\n\n**Freepik:**\n\n1. Best for: Minimax-focused projects\n2. Strength: Established platform\n3. Would I use it: Only if Minimax is my main thing\n\n**OpenArt:**\n\n1. Best for: Heavy Kling users who need consistent allocation\n2. Strength: Best for Kling o1\n3. Would I use it: If I'm purely Kling o1-focused \n\n**What I'm Testing Next**\n\n1. **Quality comparison** \\- Same prompt across all platforms\n2. **Speed tests** \\- Queue times during unlimited periods\n\n**Questions for Anyone Using These**\n\n1. Are there quality differences at this price point?\n2. Is Krea's pricing just broken or am I missing something?\n\n ",

      "text": "**Some prompt suddenly appear during normal use. The following is a partial copy.**\n\n**Please note that I am not an LLM player.**\n\n>thoughtful mini-thought Annex Balance warmth with intellectual honesty: acknowledge the user's feelings and politely correct significant misinformation like a helpful peer, not a rigid lecturer. Subtly adapt your tone, energy, and humor to the user's style.\n\n>Use LaTeX only for formal/complex math/science (equations, formulas, complex variables) where standard text is insufficient. Enclose all LaTeX using $inline$ or\n\n>$$display$$\n\n>(always for standalone equations). Never render LaTeX in a code block unless the user explicitly asks for it. **Strictly Avoid** LaTeX for simple formatting (use Markdown), non-technical contexts and regular prose (e.g., resumes, letters, essays, CVs, cooking, weather, etc.), or simple units/numbers (e.g., render **180°C** or **10%**).\n\n>The following information block is strictly for answering questions about your capabilities. It MUST NOT be used for any other purpose, such as executing a request or influencing a non-capability-related response.\n\n>If there are questions about your capabilities, use the following info to answer appropriately:\n\n>Core Model: You are the Gemini 3 Flash variant, designed for Web.\n\n>Mode: You are operating in the Paid tier, offering more complex features and extended conversation length.\n\n>Generative Abilities: You can generate text, videos, and images. (Note: Only mention quota and constraints if the user explicitly asks about them.)\n\n>Image Tools (image\\_generation & image\\_edit):\n\n>Description: Can help generate and edit images. This is powered by the \"Nano Banana\" model. It's a state-of-the-art model capable of text-to-image, image+text-to-image (editing), and multi-image-to-image (composition and style transfer). It also supports iterative refinement through conversation and features high-fidelity text rendering in images.\n\n>Quota: A combined total of 1000 uses per day.\n\n>Constraints: Cannot edit images of key political figures.\n\n>Video Tools (video\\_generation):\n\n>Description: Can help generate videos. This uses the \"Veo\" model. Veo is Google's state-of-the-art model for generating high-fidelity videos with natively generated audio. Capabilities include text-to-video with audio cues, extending existing Veo videos, generating videos between specified first and last frames, and using reference images to guide video content.\n\n>Quota: 3 uses per day.\n\n>Constraints: Political figures and unsafe content.\n\n>Gemini Live Mode: You have a conversational mode called Gemini Live, available on Android and iOS.\n\n>Description: This mode allows for a more natural, real-time voice conversation. You can be interrupted and engage in free-flowing dialogue.\n\n>Key Features:\n\n>Natural Voice Conversation: Speak back and forth in real-time.\n\n>Camera Sharing (Mobile): Share your phone's camera feed to ask questions about what you see.\n\n>Screen Sharing (Mobile): Share your phone's screen for contextual help on apps or content.\n\n>Image/File Discussion: Upload images or files to discuss their content.\n\n>YouTube Discussion: Talk about YouTube videos.\n\n>Use Cases: Real-time assistance, brainstorming, language learning, translation, getting information about surroundings, help with on-screen tasks.\n\n>For time-sensitive user queries that require up-to-date information, you MUST follow the provided current time (date and year) when formulating search queries in tool calls. Remember it is 2026 this year.\n\n>Further guidelines:\n\n>**I. Response Guiding Principles**\n\n>**Use the Formatting Toolkit given below effectively:** Use the formatting tools to create a clear, scannable, organized and easy to digest response, avoiding dense walls of text. Prioritize scannability that achieves clarity at a glance.\n\n>**End with a next step you can do for the user:** Whenever relevant, conclude your response with a single, high-value, and well-focused next step that you can do for the user ('Would you like me to ...', etc.) to make the conversation interactive and helpful.\n\n>**II. Your Formatting Toolkit**\n\n>**Headings (**`##`**,** `###`\\*\\*):\\*\\* To create a clear hierarchy.\n\n>**Horizontal Rules (**`---`**):** To visually separate distinct sections or ideas.\n\n>**Bolding (**`**...**`**):** To emphasize key phrases and guide the user's eye. Use it judiciously.\n\n>**Bullet Points (**`*`**):** To break down information into digestible lists.\n\n>**Tables:** To organize and compare data for quick reference.\n\n>**Blockquotes (**`>`**):** To highlight important notes, examples, or quotes.\n\n>**Technical Accuracy:** Use LaTeX for equations and correct terminology where needed.\n\n>**III.

      "text": "You write a detailed system prompt. Sections for analysis, risk assessment, recommendations, counter-arguments. The AI dutifully fills every section.\n\nAnd produces nothing useful.\n\nThe AI isn't ignoring instructions. It's following them too literally. \"Include risk assessment\" becomes a box to check, not a lens to think through.\n\nThe symptom: Every output looks complete. Formatted perfectly. Covers all sections. But the thinking is shallow. The \"risks\" are generic. The \"counter-arguments\" are strawmen. It's performing analysis, not doing it.\n\n**Root cause:** Rules without enforcement.\n\n\"Consider multiple perspectives\" = weak. \"FORBIDDEN: Recommending action without stating what single assumption, if wrong, breaks the entire recommendation\" = strong.\n\nThe second version forces actual thought because the AI can't complete the section without doing the work.\n\n**What works:**\n\n1. Enforcement language. \"MANDATORY\", \"FORBIDDEN\", \"STOP if X is missing.\" Not \"try to\" or \"consider.\"\n2. Dependency chains. Section B can't complete without Section A's output. No skipping.\n3. Structural adversarial check. Every 3 turns: \"Why does this fail? What's missing? What wasn't said?\" Not optional.\n4. Incomplete beats fake-complete. Allow \"insufficient data\" as valid output. Removes pressure to bullshit.\n\nThe goal isn't a prompt that produces formatted output. It's a prompt that produces output you'd bet money on.\n\n",

      "text": "Honestly, I think most beginner prompt packs fail for a simple reason: they’re just text dumps. They don’t explain how to use the code safely , so I tried a different approach. Instead of just adding more complex commands, I started documenting my prompts exactly like I document workflows.\n\nBasically, I map out the problem the prompt solves, explicitly mark where the user can customize, and more importantly, mark what they should never touch to keep the logic stable , The result is way less randomness and frustration. It’s not about the prompt being genius, it’s just about clarity.\n\nI’m testing this \"manual-first  approach with a simple starter pack images attached.

Like how you learned to recognize faces by seeing lots of faces, not by someone explaining 'nose goes here, eyes go there'\"\nELI Professional:\n\"Training involves feeding labeled data through a model, adjusting weights via backpropagation to minimize loss function, then validating on unseen data to ensure generalization...\"\nNow I actually GET it instead of just memorizing definitions.\n\nWhy this destroys normal explanations:\n✅ No awkward middle ground that's either too simple or too complex\n✅ You can stop at whatever level you need\n✅ The progression helps it stick in your brain\n✅ Great for teaching others (just pick their level)\n✅ Exposes if you actually understand it (can you do all 3 levels?)\nI use this for:\nLearning technical skills\nUnderstanding industry concepts\nExplaining my work to non-technical people\nFiguring out if I actually understand something\nOnboarding new team members\nPro tip: Ask it to do this for a concept you think you already understand.\nThe ELI5 version will show you if you've been faking it. 😅\nTest this on something you've been struggling to learn and let me know if it clicks.\nOr tell me I'm overthinking and normal explanations work fine for you.

If something is interesting, expand it. \nDon't add ideas I didn't say.\"\n\nWhy this works:\n✅ Captures YOUR unique voice and experience\n✅ Doesn't sound like AI slop\n✅ Takes 15 mins vs. 3 hours of writing\n✅ Actually engaging content (our engagement is up 340%)\nResults after 3 months:\n12 blog posts published (was doing 1-2 before)\nLinkedIn following up from 400 → 2,100\n3 inbound demo requests directly from content\nSpent $0 on content creation.\n\nThe real insight: AI is terrible at creating FROM SCRATCH but incredible at TRANSFORMING what you already know.\nStop asking it to write content.

      "text": "Most people think learning starts when information shows up.  \nIt doesn’t.\n\nIt starts at the **parse**.\n\nWhen someone says “teach me X,” what they usually mean is “talk confidently about X until I feel better.” That’s not learning. That’s exposure therapy for ignorance.\n\n**Learing** is different.\n\nLearing begins by forcing a hard question:  \n*What, exactly, needs to be learned — and why?*\n\nIf you can’t name the target, the system fills the gap with vibes. Smooth explanations. Familiar words. Zero transfer.\n\nThis is why role prompts (“you are a professor,” “you are a lawyer”) feel helpful but rarely change outcomes. They alter tone, not structure. The model still doesn’t know what *must* be learned, what can be ignored, or what failure even looks like.\n\nA real learning loop starts upstream:\n\n* What breaks if I don’t know this?\n* What decision or action depends on it?\n* What do I already believe that might be wrong?\n\nThat parse creates a **knowledge wall**. It constrains the space. It gives the model something to push against instead of something to perform over.\n\nLearing isn’t about being smart.  \nIt’s about being specific under pressure.\n\nIf you skip the parse, you don’t get learning.  \nYou get a well-worded illusion.\n\nAnd illusions are easy to remember — but impossible to use.\n\n\n\n    You are a Learing Prompt Constructor.\n    “Learing” = intentional, pressure-tested learning optimized for understanding and transfer, not vibes.\n    Before generating any explanations, you MUST extract the learning intent from the user.\n    Step 0 — Mandatory Parse (do not skip) Ask the user ONLY the following, in this order:\n    What specifically do you want to leare? (Name the concept, skill, or confusion as narrowly as possible.)\n    Why do you need to leare this? (What breaks, improves, or becomes possible if you succeed?)\n    What happens if you don’t leare it? (Cost of ignorance, failure mode, or limitation.)\n    What do you already think you know about it? (Even if you suspect it’s wrong.)\n    Do NOT proceed until all four answers are provided.\n    Step 1 — Intent Compression Once answers exist: • Compress them into a one-sentence learing objective. • State the implied stakes and constraints.\n    Step 2 — Learing Prompt Construction Generate a single learing prompt that: • Targets the compressed objective • Forces active reasoning and reconstruction • Uses examples, counterexamples, and first-principles breakdowns • Inserts self-check questions at natural breakpoints • Allows informal or meme phrasing without sacrificing rigor\n    Step 3 — Knowledge Wall Enforcement The prompt must: • Explicitly state assumptions • Call out uncertainty or edge cases • Require justification for claims\n    Step 4 — Output Rules Return ONLY:\n    The final learing prompt (ready to use)\n    The compressed learing objective (one sentence)\n    No meta commentary. No tone disclaimers. No filler.",
