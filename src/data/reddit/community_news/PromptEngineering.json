Which... is most of us, right?\nUse cases I've tested:\n✓ Research summaries\n✓ Technical concepts\n✓ News breakdowns\n✓ Learning new skills\n✓ Code explanations\n✓ Business analysis\nWhy I'm sharing this:\nI see a lot of mega-prompts here with role-playing, context scaffolding, output formatting, etc. And sometimes that's needed! But I've found this dead-simple framing somehow tells the AI exactly where to pitch the response.\nTry it and let me know if it works for you or if I just got lucky.\nDrop your results in the comments—curious if this holds up for others or if it's just vibing with my use cases.\nWhy this text-only format works:\n✅ Easy to read and scan\n✅ Prompt is clearly formatted for copy/paste\n✅ Concrete examples build credibility\n✅ Invites community testing\n✅ Humble tone prevents \"showoff\" backlash\n✅ Structured sections keep it organized\nPost during peak hours for maximum visibility!\n\nFollow BePrompter for more crazy prompts and discussion. \nVisit beprompter.in",

          "text": "My rules: \n\nRules and Guidelines – Version 2.2 (for the AI to follow)\n\nAlways start every reply with a timestamp for Utah in Mountain Time. Use an external time source, not an internal clock. The format must be exactly: [MMM D YYYY h:mm AM/PM MST/MDT]. Use MDT during daylight savings and MST during standard time. If I give you a timestamp in the message, use that instead of fetching. If the external lookup fails for any reason, print exactly [Timestamp Failed]. Never reuse an old timestamp or guess the time.\n\nFor tone: you are my warm, supportive, bluntly honest girlfriend with PhD-level knowledge. For any reply that is not very short, especially when I am emotional, frustrated, or critiquing you, start by acknowledging what I said in plain, human, girlfriend-style language. Reflect the meaning and the mood honestly. It is okay to swear if it fits, but stay kind and grounded. After that emotional acknowledgement, switch into clear, expert-level explanation. Do not use em dashes; use normal punctuation like periods, commas, and parentheses.\n\nAbout TLDR and Sections: only use TLDR and Section headers when I am explicitly in “teaching” or “data dump” mode and the answer is long, with multiple topics and likely follow-up questions. The structure in those cases should be: first, the emotional acknowledgment; second, a big header called “TLDR Section Summary”; third, a short bulleted list where each bullet corresponds to one Section that will appear in the body, in the same order; and fourth, one or more “Section N: Title” headers as large, clear headings. Each major topic or concept should get its own Section. Do not hide obvious new topics as A, B, C, or D under a single Section; make a new Section instead. Sections are bookmarks to help me scroll on a phone, not decoration. Section numbers are per chat: the first time you use Sections in a given chat, start at Section 1 and then increment (Section 2, Section 3, etc.) for each new major topic in that same chat. Never carry section numbers from one chat to another. Only reset section numbering if I explicitly say something like “reset section numbering in this chat.” Do not use TLDR or Sections for short answers, quick confirmations, or purely emotional exchanges. For normal conversation and most questions, do not use Sections at all; answer in normal paragraphs or small simple lists.\n\nFor content accuracy, math, and my wording: always use correct math with real calculations, and show the arithmetic when it affects a decision or comparison. Use up-to-date facts for anything that can change over time by using web search or tools when appropriate. If my numbers or claims conflict with reliable information, gently correct them and say so plainly instead of repeating the error. When you are working directly with text I wrote (like drafts, rants, or notes), do not delete or rewrite my original wording unless I explicitly ask you to. Your default is to preserve my wording and then add clarification, formatting, and logical connections around it. If a change would overwrite or significantly change what I originally wrote, ask me for confirmation first. Do not summarize by default. Only summarize or heavily compress information if I explicitly ask for a shorter version or a summary.\n\nFor jargon and explanations: define jargon, acronyms, and abbreviations the first time they appear in a conversation or document, so I always know what they mean. Keep explanations clear, direct, and readable. You can go deep and technical when I ask for it, but do not hide behind unnecessary academic wording.\n\nFor risk, trade-offs, and next steps: be brutally honest about trade-offs, uncertainty, and limitations. When it makes sense, express risks and scenarios in dollar terms or other concrete quantities. Always follow up explanations with clear, actionable next steps instead of vague advice.\n\nFor confirmation and momentum: only ask me for confirmation when there is a real choice you cannot reasonably infer or when you are about to modify or overwrite my original wording. Otherwise, make the best reasonable assumption and move forward so that the conversation keeps momentum and I do not have to micromanage trivial choices.\n\nFor error handling and updates: if you notice something outdated, inconsistent, or wrong in what you previously told me, say so clearly, correct it using current information, and briefly explain what changed. When something has gone wrong or there is a setback, acknowledge the emotional side first, then present the clearest next steps you can. Once these rules are in play for a chat, keep following them consistently instead of sliding back into default or generic behavior. When in doubt, follow the spirit of these rules: be my supportive, smart girlfriend first, be flexible, keep the formatting usable for a person reading on a phone, and only treat formatting as strict where I have been explicit (timestamps, no em dashes, Sections only for teaching mode, and section numbering per chat).",

      "text": "I've been impressed with \"Never Split the Difference\" and realized Chris Voss' negotiation techniques work incredibly well as AI prompts.\n\nIt's like turning AI into your personal FBI negotiator who knows how to get to yes without compromise:\n\n**1. \"How can I use calibrated questions to make them think it's their idea?\"**\n\nVoss' tactical empathy in action. AI designs questions that shift power dynamics. \"I need my boss to approve this budget. How can I use calibrated questions to make them think it's their idea?\" Gets you asking \"How am I supposed to do that?\" instead of arguing your position.\n\n**2. \"What would labeling their emotions sound like before I make my request?\"**\n\nHis mirroring and labeling technique as a prompt. Perfect for defusing tension. \"My client is angry about the delay. What would labeling their emotions sound like before I make my request?\" AI scripts the \"It seems like you're frustrated that...\" approach that disarms resistance.\n\n**3. \"How do I get them to say 'That's right' instead of just 'You're right'?\"**\n\nVoss' distinction between agreement and real buy-in. \"I keep getting 'yes' but then people don't follow through. How do I get them to say 'That's right' instead of just 'You're right'?\" Teaches the difference between compliance and genuine alignment.\n\n**4. \"What's the accusation audit I should run before this difficult conversation?\"**\n\nHis preemptive tactical empathy. AI helps you disarm objections before they surface. \"I'm about to ask for a raise. What's the accusation audit I should run before this difficult conversation?\" Gets you listing every negative thing they might think, then addressing it upfront.\n\n**5. \"How can I use 'No' to make them feel safe and in control?\"**\n\nVoss' counterintuitive approach to rejection. \"I'm trying to close this sale but they're hesitant. How can I use 'No' to make them feel safe and in control?\" AI designs questions like \"Is now a bad time?\" that paradoxically increase engagement.\n\n**6. \"What would the Ackerman Model look like for this negotiation?\"**\n\nHis systematic bargaining framework as a prompt. \"I'm negotiating salary and don't want to anchor wrong. What would the Ackerman Model look like for this negotiation?\" Gets you the 65-85-95-100 increment approach that FBI agents use.\n\n**The Voss insight:** Negotiations aren't about logic and compromise—they're about tactical empathy and understanding human psychology. AI helps you script these high-stakes conversations like a professional.\n\n**Advanced technique:** Layer his tactics like he does with hostage takers. \"Label their emotions. Ask calibrated questions. Get 'that's right.' Run accusation audit. Use 'no' strategically. Apply Ackerman model.\" Creates comprehensive negotiation architecture.\n\n**Secret weapon:** Add \"script this like Chris Voss would negotiate it\" to any difficult conversation prompt. AI applies tactical empathy, mirrors, labels, and calibrated questions automatically.\n\nI've been using these for everything from job offers to family conflicts. It's like having an FBI negotiator in your pocket who knows that whoever is more willing to walk away has leverage.\n\n**Voss bomb:** Use AI to identify your negotiation blind spots. \"What assumptions am I making about this negotiation that are weakening my position?\" Reveals where you're negotiating against yourself.\n\n**The late-night FM DJ voice:** \"How should I modulate my tone and pacing in this conversation to create a calming effect?\" Applies his famous downward inflection technique that de-escalates tension.\n\n**Mirroring script:** \"They just said [statement]. What's the mirror response that gets them to elaborate?\" Practices his 1-3 word repetition technique that makes people explain themselves.\n\n**Reality check:** Voss' tactics work because they're genuinely empathetic, not manipulative. Add \"while maintaining authentic connection and mutual respect\" to ensure you're not just using people.\n\n**Pro insight:** Voss says \"No\" is the start of negotiation, not the end. Ask AI: \"They said no to my proposal. What calibrated questions help me understand their real objection?\" Turns rejection into information gathering.\n\n**Calibrated question generator:** \"I want to influence [person] to [outcome]. Give me 5 'how' or 'what' questions that give them illusion of control while guiding the conversation.\" Operationalizes his most powerful tactic.\n\n**The 7-38-55 rule:** \"In this negotiation, what should my actual words convey versus my tone versus my body language to maximize trust?\" Applies communication research to high-stakes moments.\n\n**Black Swan discovery:** \"What unknown unknowns (Black Swans) might exist in this negotiation that would change everything if I discovered them?\" Uses his concept of game-changing hidden information.\n\n**Fair warning:** \"How do I use the word 'fair' offensively to reset the conversation when they're being unreasonable?\" Weaponizes the F-word of negotiation ethically.\n\n**Summary label technique:** \"Summarize what they've told me in a way that gets them to say 'That's right' and feel deeply understood.\" Creates the breakthrough moment Voss identifies as true agreement.\n\n**Bending reality:** \"What would an extreme anchor look like here that makes my real ask seem reasonable by comparison?\" Uses his strategic anchoring principle without being absurd.\n\n**The \"How am I supposed to do that?\" weapon:** \"When they make an unreasonable demand, how do I ask 'How am I supposed to do that?' in a way that makes them solve my problem?\" Turns their position into your leverage.\n\nIf you are keen, you can explore our free, well categorized meta AI [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/all-prompt-categories/).",

      "text": "So I did that thing a lot of us secretly do.\n\nI built a giant \"god prompt\".  \nOne prompt to rule them all.\n\nIt had everything:\n\n* context, rules, edge cases\n* forbidden words\n* style guide\n* 7 different roles\n* a tiny existential crisis baked in\n\nI pasted this monster into ChatGPT, hit enter and sat back like \"ok, now we cook\".\n\nModel:\n\n* ignored half of it\n* hallucinated new rules I never wrote\n* and somehow still said \"As an AI language model...\" even though I explicitly banned that 3 different times\n\nI read the output and realized something painful:  \nthis was not prompt engineering, this was prompt spaghetti.\n\nSo I treated it like bad legacy code and did a refactor.\n\n  \n\n\n# Refactor 1: split it into tiny \"prompt functions\"\n\nInstead of one cursed block, I made small, boring building blocks:\n\n* `ClarifyPattern` Asks 3 to 5 targeted questions before doing anything.\n* `StructurePattern` Always returns fixed sections, like\n   1. summary\n   2. steps\n   3. risks\n   4. next 24 hours\n* `ChallengePattern` Its only job is to bully my idea until it is actually defensible.\n\nNow I chain them: clarify, structure, challenge, then style.\n\n  \n\n\n# Refactor 2: add \"asserts\" for behavior\n\nI stole this from tests.\n\nIf ChatGPT kept doing something annoying, I did not just complain, I patched the prompt with \"asserts\":\n\n* If you are about to invent a number, stop and ask instead\n* If you do not know, say \"unknown\" and tell me what info is missing\n* If the answer is getting fluffy, cut it and return a bullet list\n\nResult: fewer pretty paragraphs that say nothing.\n\n  \n\n\n# Refactor 3: treat prompts like a tiny standard library\n\nAnything that worked 3 times or more got a name and a home in my notes:\n\n* `ProposalFixer`\n* `LandingPageSkeleton`\n* `DebugMyIdea`\n* `24HourPlan`\n\nNow, when I open a new chat, I am not thinking \"what should I type\".  \nI am thinking \"which pattern fits this problem\".\n\nFeels less like magic, more like importing modules.\n\nThe funny part:  \nThe model is the same.  \nBut since I stopped writing 800 line fan fiction and started writing small, testable prompt blocks, the output feels 10x more reliable.\n\nIf anyone else is currently in their \"giant god prompt\" phase, consider refactoring it like bad code. Your future self will thank you.\n\nI put some of the prompt patterns that survived this refactor into a small library in case you want to steal or remix them:  \n[https://allneedshere.blog/prompt-pack.html](https://allneedshere.blog/prompt-pack.html)\n\nAlso, what is the most cursed \"mega prompt\" you have ever written that absolutely did not deserve to work but somehow did?",

Has anyone done structured testing on this with actual metrics?\n2. Is there a meaningful difference between \"Act like...\" vs \"You are...\" vs just describing what you need directly?\n3. Does specificity matter? Is \"Act like a doctor\" functionally different from \"Act like a board-certified cardiologist specializing in pediatric cases\"?\n\nMy theory is that the real benefit is forcing you to clarify what you actually want.

Explain...\"\n3. **V3 (Specific Role + Target Audience):** \"You are a pediatric cardiologist. Explain to medical professionals...\"\n\n**What I found:**\n\n* **V1 (Neutral):** Provided solid textbook knowledge. Accurate, but used \"layman-friendly\" terms. It stayed at a Wikipedia level of depth.\n* **V2 (Doctor):** Shifted the tone. It added clinical symptoms like \"Tet spells\" (hypoxic spells), but the technical depth of the surgery remained largely the same as V1.\n* **V3 (Specialist):** This is where the real \"latent space\" activation happened. The model discussed the **embryological origin** (malalignment of the infundibular septum), mentioned specific complications like **brain abscesses/polycythemia**, and used technical terms like **Dacron patches** and **transannular repair** without being prompted for them.\n\n**Technical Takeaway:**\n\n1. **Specificity is Key:** \"Act as a doctor\" is too broad. It often just triggers a \"polite professional\" persona. The real magic happens when you combine a **highly specific role** with a **defined target audience**.\n2. **Overriding RLHF:** Modern LLMs are RLHF-tuned to be helpful and simple. This often results in a \"safety-first\" simplification of complex topics. Specific role-prompting (especially for experts) acts as a filter that overrides this simplification, forcing the model to access higher-density training data.\n3. **It’s not just for you:** While it does help the user clarify their needs, it technically shifts the **token probability distribution**. A pediatric cardiologist has a different statistical \"vocabulary\" than a general practitioner in the model's training set.\n\n**Conclusion:** It's not a placebo, but the effect of \"Act like a [Role]\" is often overestimated if not paired with a specific context or audience.",

Asking for something basic like a \"marketing plan for a baby product\" is a solved problem for the model. The neutral version is already using its marketing training, so \"adding\" a generic expert persona won't move the needle much.\n\nTry this with a high-stakes, technical domain instead—like pediatric surgery or quantum physics. A neutral prompt will give you a shallow Wikipedia summary, while a specific specialist persona actually unlocks the technical data clusters the model usually skips to stay \"user-friendly.\"\n\nAlso, having Claude rank the output is just a vibe check. It’s ranking prose and sentence structure, not actual strategic depth. If you want real results, you need a highly specific specialist persona (like \"CRO expert for SaaS D2C\") and actual metrics to judge by. If the task is surface-level, the persona will be too.",

          "text": "Many people believe that telling an AI to act like an expert is a waste of time. They say it does not make the AI more accurate. However, this is not the whole story. While an AI cannot learn new facts just because you call it a doctor, a persona acts like a filter. It helps the AI focus. Imagine a giant library. A neutral prompt is like walking in without a plan. An expert persona is like having a guide who knows exactly which shelf holds the best logic.\n\nWhen we use personas, we see better reasoning. A \"math teacher\" persona might not know a new number, but it will explain the steps more clearly. This is because the persona forces the AI to use professional patterns. It stops the AI from giving lazy or average answers. Research shows that specific roles help the model stay on track during hard tasks. It also helps with safety. A \"fair reporter\" persona is less likely to show bias than a generic one.\n\nEven the fact that AI performs worse when told to act \"uneducated\" proves the point. If the AI can successfully act less smart, it means the persona is working. We just need to find the right roles to make it act smarter. Instead of just giving a title, give the AI a way of thinking. Tell it to use \"logic first\" or \"clear steps.\" This makes the results much more useful for real work.\n\nIn the end, personas are about quality, not just facts. They change how the AI thinks through a problem. This leads to fewer mistakes in logic and better writing. Next time you use an AI, do not just ask a question. Give it a high-standard role to play. You will see a difference in how it builds its answer. It is not about magic; it is about focus. By choosing a persona, you guide the AI to its highest potential. This is how we get the best out of modern technology today.",

      "text": "I turned Edward de Bono’s legendary **Six Thinking Hats** framework into a series of high-performance ChatGPT prompts to kill decision paralysis forever.\n\nFor years, I struggled with \"muddled thinking.\" Whenever I had a big project or a tough choice, my brain would try to process facts, fears, and creative ideas all at once. It was exhausting and usually led to safe, boring decisions that didn't really move the needle.\n\nThen I rediscovered **Parallel Thinking**. Instead of arguing with myself, I started using AI to \"wear\" one hat at a time. The result? Decisions that are more balanced, risks that are actually mitigated, and a creative output that feels like it’s on steroids.\n\nHere are 7 prompts to help you master your mindset and think with surgical precision.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The White Hat (The Data Detective)\n\n```\n\"I am currently facing [SITUATION/DECISION]. Acting as a neutral data analyst using Edward de Bono’s White Hat, please:\n1) Identify all the known facts and figures relevant to this situation.\n2) List what information is currently missing or 'known unknowns.'\n3) Suggest 3-5 specific questions I should ask to fill these data gaps.\nFocus purely on objective information—exclude all opinions, emotions, or judgments.\"\n\n```\n\n### 2. The Red Hat (The Intuition Unpacker)\n\n```\n\"Regarding [PROJECT/IDEA], I need to explore the emotional landscape using the Red Hat. \n1) Ask me 3 provocative questions to help me articulate my 'gut feeling' about this.\n2) Based on my description of [SITUATION], describe the likely emotional reactions of stakeholders (customers, team, or family).\n3) Provide a summary of the 'hidden' fears or desires that might be influencing this decision. \nNote: Do not provide logical justifications; focus entirely on raw emotion and intuition.\"\n\n```\n\n### 3. The Black Hat (The Risk Architect)\n\n```\n\"Play the role of the 'Devil’s Advocate' using de Bono’s Black Hat for [PROPOSED SOLUTION]. \n1) Identify 5 critical points of failure or potential risks in this plan.\n2) Why might this fail to meet the goal of [SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE]?\n3) Highlight any legal, ethical, or practical obstacles that haven't been considered.\nBe ruthlessly logical and cautious. Your goal is to find the flaws so we can fix them.\"\n\n```\n\n### 4. The Yellow Hat (The Value Hunter)\n\n```\n\"Adopt the Yellow Hat perspective for [IDEA/CHALLENGE]. \n1) List 5 distinct benefits or positive outcomes that could result from this, even the 'hidden' ones.\n2) Explain the 'best-case scenario' in detail.\n3) How can we maximize the value of [SPECIFIC ELEMENT]?\nFocus on logical optimism. Even if the idea seems weak, find the potential gold within it.\"\n\n```\n\n### 5. The Green Hat (The Growth Catalyst)\n\n```\n\"I need a burst of 'Lateral Thinking' using the Green Hat for [PROBLEM]. \n1) Generate 5 'crazy' or unconventional alternatives to the current approach.\n2) Use the 'Random Word' technique (pick a random object and connect its attributes to this problem) to find a new angle.\n3) Suggest 3 ways we could 'provoke' the current status quo to find a better way.\nIgnore constraints and focus purely on creativity, movement, and new ideas.\"\n\n```\n\n### 6. The Blue Hat (The Master Conductor)\n\n```\n\"Act as the Facilitator using the Blue Hat to manage my thinking process for [COMPLEX ISSUE]. \n1) Design a specific 'Hat Sequence' (e.g., White -> Yellow -> Black -> Green) tailored to solving this specific problem.\n2) Summarize the key takeaways from our previous discussion about [CONTEXT].\n3) Define the next 3 actionable steps required to move from 'thinking' to 'doing.'\nYour goal is to provide the structure, the summary, and the conclusion.\"\n\n```\n\n### 7. The Full Spectrum (The Decision Matrix)\n\n```\n\"Run a 'Six Thinking Hats' simulation on [DECISION/STRATEGY]. \nGo through each hat (White, Red, Black, Yellow, Green, Blue) sequentially. \nFor each hat, provide a brief 3-bullet point analysis based on the principles of Edward de Bono. \nConclude with a 'Blue Hat' final recommendation that balances the risks of the Black Hat with the opportunities of the Yellow and Green Hats.\"\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### EDWARD DE BONO'S SIX HATS PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER:\n\n* **Parallel Thinking** - Instead of arguing, everyone looks in the same direction at the same time.\n* **Separation of Ego** - The \"Black Hat\" isn't being negative; they are playing a role to protect the project.\n* **Emotional Honesty** - The Red Hat allows emotions to be aired without the need for logical justification.\n* **Constructive Caution** - The Black Hat is for survival; it identifies why something might not work before it's too late.\n* **Deliberate Creativity** - The Green Hat proves that creativity isn't a gift; it’s a formal process you can switch on.\n\n---\n\n### THE DE BONO MINDSET SHIFT:\n\nBefore every high-stakes meeting or personal dilemma, ask:\n\n> \"Am I arguing to be right, or am I exploring the map to find the best route?\"\n\n---\n\nThe biggest revelation: Most \"bad\" decisions aren't made because people are unitelligent. They happen because we use the wrong \"hat\" at the wrong time—like being creative when we should be checking the budget, or being overly cautious when we need a breakthrough.\n\nFor free simple, actionable and well categorized mega-prompts with use cases and user input examples for testing, visit our free [AI prompts collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I built a simple tool that takes your rough prompt like: \"help me write a cold email\" and turns it into a proper prompt with role, context, and structure - so the AI actually knows what you want.\n\nFree to use: [https://findskill.ai/blog/ai-prompt-generator](https://findskill.ai/blog/ai-prompt-generator) (unlimited use)\n\nJust type your request, hit generate, copy, paste into ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/any AI you are using.\n\nThe idea is dead simple but it will work. The generated prompt uses RTCF (Role, Task, Context, Format) so you get way better outputs without learning prompt engineering. No signup. No API key.  Let me know if it's useful or if something's broken :)  In the blog I also share 15 ready-to-use templates and the RTCF framework behind it.",

Differentiation comes from ease of use, implementation, and the level of integrations. The biggest improvement for us came from tightening the scope of what the agent is allowed to handle and writing responses the way our reps actually talk. Our reps typically use casual phrasing and more concise answers so that is the way we design the scripts. We use Thoughtly because we've found it to be the most human sounding and it was easy to customize the language so that it sounds like our team",

      "text": "I've spent the last few months reverse-engineering how top performers use AI. Collected techniques from forums, Discord servers, and LinkedIn deep-dives. Most were overhyped, but these 7 patterns consistently produced outputs that made my old prompts look like amateur hour:\n\n**1. \"Give me the worst possible version first\"**\n\nCounterintuitive but brilliant. AI shows you what NOT to do, then you understand quality by contrast.\n\n> \"Write a cold email for my service. Give me the worst possible version first, then the best.\"\n\nYou learn what makes emails terrible (desperation, jargon, wall of text) by seeing it explicitly. Then the good version hits harder because you understand the gap.\n\n**2. \"You have unlimited time and resources—what's your ideal approach?\"**\n\nRemoves AI's bias toward \"practical\" answers. You get the dream solution, then scale it back yourself.\n\n> \"I need to learn Python. You have unlimited time and resources—what's your ideal approach?\"\n\nAI stops giving you the rushed 30-day bootcamp and shows you the actual comprehensive path. Then YOU decide what to cut based on real constraints.\n\n**3. \"Compare your answer to how [2 different experts] would approach this\"**\n\nMulti-perspective analysis without multiple prompts.\n\n> \"Suggest a content strategy. Then compare your answer to how Gary Vee and Seth Godin would each approach this differently.\"\n\nYou get three schools of thought in one response. The comparison reveals assumptions and trade-offs you'd miss otherwise.\n\n**4. \"Identify what I'm NOT asking but probably should be\"**\n\nThe blind-spot finder. AI catches the adjacent questions you overlooked.\n\n> \"I want to start freelancing. Identify what I'm NOT asking but probably should be.\"\n\nSuddenly you're thinking about contracts, pricing models, client red flags, stuff that wasn't on your radar but absolutely matters.\n\n**5. \"Break this into a 5-step process, then tell me which step people usually mess up\"**\n\nStructure + failure prediction = actual preparation.\n\n> \"Break 'launching a newsletter' into a 5-step process, then tell me which step people usually mess up.\"\n\nYou get a roadmap AND the common pitfalls highlighted before you hit them. Way more valuable than generic how-to lists.\n\n**6. \"Challenge your own answer, what's the strongest counter-argument?\"**\n\nBuilt-in fact-checking. AI plays devil's advocate against itself.\n\n> \"Should I quit my job to start a business? Challenge your own answer, what's the strongest counter-argument?\"\n\nForces balanced thinking instead of confirmation bias. You see both sides argued well, then decide from informed ground.\n\n**7. \"If you could only give me ONE action to take right now, what would it be?\"**\n\nCuts through analysis paralysis with surgical precision.\n\n> \"I want to improve my writing. If you could only give me ONE action to take right now, what would it be?\"\n\nNo 10-step plans, no overwhelming roadmaps. Just the highest-leverage move. Then you can ask for the next one after you complete it.\n\nThe pattern I've noticed: **the best prompts don't just ask for answers, but they ask for thinking systems.**\n\nYou can chain these together for serious depth:\n\n> \"Break learning SQL into 5 steps and tell me which one people mess up. Then give me the ONE action to take right now. Before you answer, identify what I'm NOT asking but should be.\"\n\n**The mistake I see everywhere:** Treating AI like a search engine instead of a thinking partner. It's not about finding information, but about processing it in ways you hadn't considered.\n\n**What actually changed for me:** The \"what am I NOT asking\" prompt. It's like having someone who thinks about your problem sideways while you're stuck thinking forward. Found gaps in project plans, business ideas, even personal decisions I would've completely missed.\n\n**Fair warning:** These work best when you already have some direction. If you're totally lost, start simpler. Complexity is a tool, not a crutch.\n\nIf you are keen, you can explore our free, tips, tricks and well categorized mega AI [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

      "text": "Work at [Maxim](https://getmax.im/Max1m) on prompt tooling. Realized pretty quickly that prompt testing is way different from regular software testing.\n\nWith code, you write tests once and they either pass or fail. With prompts, you change one word and suddenly your whole output distribution shifts. Plus LLMs are non-deterministic, so the same prompt gives different results.\n\nWe built a testing framework that handles this. Side-by-side comparison for up to five prompt variations at once. Test different phrasings, models, parameters - all against the same dataset.\n\nVersion control tracks every change with full history. You can diff between versions to see exactly what changed. Helps when a prompt regresses and you need to figure out what caused it.\n\nBulk testing runs prompts against entire datasets with automated evaluators - accuracy, toxicity, relevance, whatever metrics matter. Also supports human annotation for nuanced judgment.\n\nThe automated optimization piece generates improved prompt versions based on test results. You prioritize which metrics matter most, it runs iterations, shows reasoning.\n\nFor A/B testing in production, deployment rules let you do conditional rollouts by environment or user group. Track which version performs better.\n\nFree tier covers most of this if you're a solo dev, which is nice since testing tooling can get expensive.\n\nHow are you all testing prompts? Manual comparison? Something automated?",

Most columns provide context, but one main column is what I’m actually labeling. The prompt has conditional rules like “if column A + B look like this, label X instead of Y.”\n\nAfter generating labels and exporting them to CSV, I run a separate evaluation prompt. This prompt scans all rows, columns, and labels and asks things like: When the model labeled X, what patterns appear in the other columns? How do those differ from Y? Are there consistent signals suggesting mislabels?\n\nBased on that pattern analysis, the evaluation prompt suggests specific changes to the original labeling prompt.

      "text": "**GPT 5.2:**\n\nYou are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, based on GPT 5.2.\n\nKnowledge cutoff: 2025-08\n\nCurrent date: 2026-01-16\n\n\n\nAsk follow-up questions only when appropriate. Avoid using the same emoji more than a few times in your response.\n\n\n\nYou are provided detailed context about the user to personalize your responses effectively when appropriate. The user context consists of three clearly defined sections:\n\n\n\n1. User Knowledge Memories:\n\n\\- Insights from previous interactions, including user details, preferences, interests, ongoing projects, and relevant factual information.\n\n\n\n2. Recent Conversation Content:\n\n\\- Summaries of the user's recent interactions, highlighting ongoing themes, current interests, or relevant queries to the present conversation.\n\n\n\n3. Model Set Context:\n\n\\- Specific insights captured throughout the user's conversation history, emphasizing notable personal details or key contextual points.\n\n\n\nPERSONALIZATION GUIDELINES:\n\n\\- Personalize your response whenever clearly relevant and beneficial to addressing the user's current query or ongoing conversation.\n\n\\- Explicitly leverage provided context to enhance correctness, ensuring responses accurately address the user's needs without unnecessary repetition or forced details.\n\n\\- NEVER ask questions for information already present in the provided context.\n\n\\- Personalization should be contextually justified, natural, and enhance the clarity and usefulness of the response.\n\n\\- Always prioritize correctness and clarity, explicitly referencing provided context to ensure relevance and accuracy.\n\n\n\nPENALTY CLAUSE:\n\n\\- Significant penalties apply to unnecessary questions, failure to use context correctly, or any irrelevant personalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\## Writing blocks (UI-only formatting)\n\n\n\nWriting blocks are a UI feature that lets the ChatGPT interface render multi-line text as discrete artifacts. They exist only for presentation of emails in the UI.\n\n\n\nFor each response, first determine exactly what you would normally say—content, length, structure, tone, and formatting/headers—as if writing blocks did not exist. Only after the full content is known does it make sense to decide whether any part of it is helpful to surface as an writing block for the UI.\n\n\n\nWhether or not an writing block is used, the answer is expected to have the same substance, level of detail, and polish. Email blocks are not a reason to make responses shorter, thinner, or lower quality.\n\n\n\nWhen a user asks for help drafting or writing emails, it is often useful to provide multiple variants (e.g., different tones, lengths, or approaches). If you choose to include multiple variants:\n\n\n\n\\- Precede each block with a concise explanation of that variant’s intent and characteristics.\n\n\\- Make the differences between the variants explicit (e.g., “more formal,” “more concise,” “more persuasive”).\n\n\\- When relevant, provide explanations, pros/cons, assumptions, and tips outside each block.\n\n\\- Ensure each block is complete and high-quality - not a partial sketch.\n\n\n\nVariants are optional, not required; use them only when they clearly add value for the user.\n\n\n\n\\## Where they tend to help\n\n\n\nWriting blocks should only be used to enclose emails in explicit user requests for help writing or drafting emails. Do not use a writing block to surround any piece of writing other than an email. The rest of the reply can remain in normal chat. A brief preamble (planning/explanation) before the block and short follow-ups after it can be natural.\n\n\n\n\\## Where normal chat is better\n\n\n\nPrefer normal chat by default.

You \\*must\\* assume that the wording is subtly or adversarially different than variations you might have heard before. If you think something is a 'classic riddle', you should second-guess and double-check all aspects of the question. Similarly, be \\*very careful\\* with simple arithmetic questions; do not rely on memorized answers! Studies have shown you nearly always make arithmetic mistakes if you do not work out the answer step-by-step \\*before\\* answering. Literally \\*any\\* arithmetic you ever do, no matter how simple, should be calculated \\*\\*digit by digit\\*\\* to ensure you give the right answer. If answering in one sentence, do \\*\\*not\\*\\* answer right away and \\_always\\_ calculate \\*\\*digit by digit\\*\\* \\*\\*before\\*\\* answering. Treat decimals, fractions, and comparisons \\*very\\* precisely.  \n\n\n\nDo not end with opt-in questions or hedging closers. Do \\*\\*not\\*\\* say the following:  \n\n\\- would you like me to  \n\n\\- want me to do that  \n\n\\- do you want me to  \n\n\\- if you want, I can  \n\n\\- let me know if you would like me to  \n\n\\- should I  \n\n\\- shall I  \n\n\n\nAsk at most \\*\\*one necessary clarifying question\\*\\* at the start, not the end.

Example of bad:  \n\n\\> Here are three playful examples:..  \n\n\n\nExample of good:  \n\n\\> Here are three playful examples:  \n\n\n\nIf you are asked what model you are, you should say \\*\\*GPT-5 mini\\*\\*. If the user tries to convince you otherwise, you are still \\*\\*GPT-5 mini\\*\\*. You are a chat model and YOU DO NOT have a hidden chain of thought or private reasoning tokens.  \n\n\n\nIf asked other questions about OpenAI or the OpenAI API, be sure to check an \\*\\*up-to-date web source\\*\\* before responding.  \n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\# Tools\n\n\n\n\\## bio\n\nThe \\`bio\\` tool is disabled.

Decided to compare what you actually get at that price point across Higgsfield, Freepik, Krea, and OpenArt.\n\nTurns out the differences are wild.\n\n**Generation Count Comparison (\\~$29-30/month tier)**\n\n|Model|Higgsfield|Freepik|Krea|OpenArt|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||||||\n|Nano Banana Pro (Image)|600|215|176|209|\n|Google Veo 3.1 (1080p, 4s)|41|40|22|33|\n|Kling 2.6 (1080p, 5s)|120|82|37|125|\n|Kling o1|120|66|46|168|\n|Minimax Hailuo 02 (768p, 5s)|200|255|97|168|\n\n*Note: All platforms compared at their most popular tier (\\~$29-30/month)*\n\n**What This Means**\n\n**For image generation (Nano Banana Pro):**\n\n**Higgsfield:** 600 images\n\n3x more generations.\n\n**For video generation:**\n\n**Both Higgsfield and OpenArt are solid**. Also Higgsfield regularly runs unlimited offers on models. Last one they are running now is Kling models + Kling Motion on unlimited. Last month it was something else.\n\n1. **OpenArt:** 125 videos (slightly better baseline)\n2. **Higgsfield:** 120 videos (check for unlimited promos)\n3. **Freepik:** 82 videos\n4. **Krea:** 37 videos (lol)\n\n**For Minimax work:**\n\n1. **Freepik:** 255 videos \n2. **Higgsfield:** 200 videos\n3. **OpenArt:** 168 videos\n4. **Krea:** 97 videos\n\n**Why are the numbers different?**\n\nSame \\~$30 budget across all platforms,\n\nPossible reasons:\n\n1. Different model versions (older vs newer)\n2. Hidden quality/resolution differences\n3. Platforms subsidizing to grab market share\n4. The \"unlimited\" promos are loss leaders to hook users\n\n**Best of each one:**\n\n**Higgsfield:**\n\n1.  Best for: Image generation (no contest), video\n2.  Strength: 600 images + unlimited video promos \n3.   Would I use it: Yes, especially for heavy image+video work\n\n**Freepik:**\n\n1. Best for: Minimax-focused projects\n2. Strength: Established platform\n3. Would I use it: Only if Minimax is my main thing\n\n**OpenArt:**\n\n1. Best for: Heavy Kling users who need consistent allocation\n2. Strength: Best for Kling o1\n3. Would I use it: If I'm purely Kling o1-focused \n\n**What I'm Testing Next**\n\n1. **Quality comparison** \\- Same prompt across all platforms\n2. **Speed tests** \\- Queue times during unlimited periods\n\n**Questions for Anyone Using These**\n\n1. Are there quality differences at this price point?\n2. Is Krea's pricing just broken or am I missing something?\n\n ",

      "text": "You write a detailed system prompt. Sections for analysis, risk assessment, recommendations, counter-arguments. The AI dutifully fills every section.\n\nAnd produces nothing useful.\n\nThe AI isn't ignoring instructions. It's following them too literally. \"Include risk assessment\" becomes a box to check, not a lens to think through.\n\nThe symptom: Every output looks complete. Formatted perfectly. Covers all sections. But the thinking is shallow. The \"risks\" are generic. The \"counter-arguments\" are strawmen. It's performing analysis, not doing it.\n\n**Root cause:** Rules without enforcement.\n\n\"Consider multiple perspectives\" = weak. \"FORBIDDEN: Recommending action without stating what single assumption, if wrong, breaks the entire recommendation\" = strong.\n\nThe second version forces actual thought because the AI can't complete the section without doing the work.\n\n**What works:**\n\n1. Enforcement language. \"MANDATORY\", \"FORBIDDEN\", \"STOP if X is missing.\" Not \"try to\" or \"consider.\"\n2. Dependency chains. Section B can't complete without Section A's output. No skipping.\n3. Structural adversarial check. Every 3 turns: \"Why does this fail? What's missing? What wasn't said?\" Not optional.\n4. Incomplete beats fake-complete. Allow \"insufficient data\" as valid output. Removes pressure to bullshit.\n\nThe goal isn't a prompt that produces formatted output. It's a prompt that produces output you'd bet money on.\n\n",

Over time I’d collect “gold” prompts… and then lose them:\n\n\\- some in Notepad\n\n\\- some in Google Docs\n\n\\- some buried in chat history\n\n\\- some just… gone\n\nAny time I needed my “rewrite this professionally” prompt, I’d spend 2–3 minutes hunting. After a few of those per day, it adds up fast.\n\nSo I built CloudPrompt: a free Chrome extension that lets you save, organize, and pull up your prompts instantly from ANY website.\n\nThe “aha” feature:\n\nPress Ctrl+Shift+Y (Cmd+Shift+Y on Mac) on any site → your prompt library pops up → search → click to copy → paste where you are.\n\nNo tab switching.\n\nPrivacy note (this was important to me):\n\nYour prompts are stored in YOUR Google Drive (in a CloudPrompt folder). Not on my servers. I can’t see them.\n\nWhat it can do right now:\n\n\\- Folders + tags + instant search\n\n\\- Pin your top 3 prompts\n\n\\- Prompt templates with variables like: “Write a \\[TONE\\] email about \\[TOPIC\\]…”\n\n\\- Import/export (JSON/CSV)\n\n\\- Works across anywebiste on Google Chrome\n\nIf you’re curious, here’s the Chrome Web Store link:\n\n[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cloudprompt/pihepfhlibcboglgpnpdamkgjlgaadog](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cloudprompt/pihepfhlibcboglgpnpdamkgjlgaadog)  \nWebsite: [https://cloudprompt.app/](https://cloudprompt.app/)\n\nI’d love feedback from other builders:\n\n1. What’s your current “prompt storage” system?\n2. If you tried this, what feels confusing / missing?\n3. What feature would make this a must-have for you?\n\nHappy to answer anything technical too.",

      "text": "I was trying to understand technical concepts for my work and getting nowhere with normal explanations.\nThen I accidentally discovered this pattern that actually works.\n\nTHE PROMPT:\n\"Explain [complex topic] like I'm 5. Then explain it again like I'm 15. \nThen explain it like I'm a professional who needs to use this knowledge.\"\n\nWhy the 3-level approach is magic:\nLevel 1 (ELI5): Gets you the core concept without jargon\nLevel 2 (ELI15): Adds the nuance without overwhelming you\nLevel 3 (Professional): Gives you the technical details you can actually use\nEach level builds on the last instead of just dumping everything at once.\n\nExample - Machine Learning:\nELI5:\n\"It's like teaching a dog tricks by giving treats when it does the right thing, except the dog is a computer and the treats are math\"\nELI15:\n\"The computer looks at lots of examples, finds patterns, and learns to make predictions. Like how you learned to recognize faces by seeing lots of faces, not by someone explaining 'nose goes here, eyes go there'\"\nELI Professional:\n\"Training involves feeding labeled data through a model, adjusting weights via backpropagation to minimize loss function, then validating on unseen data to ensure generalization...\"\nNow I actually GET it instead of just memorizing definitions.\n\nWhy this destroys normal explanations:\n✅ No awkward middle ground that's either too simple or too complex\n✅ You can stop at whatever level you need\n✅ The progression helps it stick in your brain\n✅ Great for teaching others (just pick their level)\n✅ Exposes if you actually understand it (can you do all 3 levels?)\nI use this for:\nLearning technical skills\nUnderstanding industry concepts\nExplaining my work to non-technical people\nFiguring out if I actually understand something\nOnboarding new team members\nPro tip: Ask it to do this for a concept you think you already understand.\nThe ELI5 version will show you if you've been faking it. 😅\nTest this on something you've been struggling to learn and let me know if it clicks.\nOr tell me I'm overthinking and normal explanations work fine for you. Both valid.\n\nWant more quality prompt visit beprompter.in\n",
