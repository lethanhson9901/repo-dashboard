      "text": "This week I ran into a couple of threads on Twitter about something called \"Socratic prompting\".\n\nAt first I thought, meh.\n\nBut my curiosity was piqued.  \nI looked up the paper they were talking about.\n\nI read it.  \nAnd I tried it.  \nAnd it is pretty cool.\n\nI’ll tell you.\n\nNormally we use ChatGPT as if it were a shitty intern.\n\n\"Write me a post about productivity.\"  \n\"Make me a marketing strategy.\"  \n\"Analyze these data.\"\n\nAnd the AI does it.\n\nBut it does it fast and without much thought.\n\nSocratic prompting is different.\n\n**Instead of giving it instructions, you ask questions.**\n\nAnd that changes how it processes the answer.\n\nHere is an example so you can see it clearly.\n\nNormal prompt:\n\n`\"Write me a value proposition for my analytics tool.\"`\n\nWhat it gives you, something correct but a bit bland.\n\nSocratic prompt:\n\n`\"What makes a value proposition attractive to someone who buys software for their company? What needs to hit emotionally and logically? Okay, now apply that to an AI analytics tool.\"`\n\nWhat it gives you, something that thought before writing.\n\nThe difference is quite noticeable.\n\nWhy does it work?\n\nBecause language models were trained on millions of examples of people reasoning. On Reddit and sites like that.\n\nWhen you ask questions, you activate that reasoning mode.  \nWhen you give direct orders, it goes on autopilot.\n\nAnother example.\n\nNormal prompt:\n\n`\"Make me a content calendar for LinkedIn.\"`\n\nSocratic prompt:\n\n`\"What type of content works best on LinkedIn for B2B companies? How often should you post so you do not tire people? How should topics connect to each other so it makes sense? Okay, now with all that, design a 30-day calendar.\"`\n\nIn the second case you force it to think the problem through before solving it.\n\nThe basic structure is this:\n\n1. First you ask something theoretical: `\"What makes this type of thing work well.\"`\n2. Then you ask about the framework: `\"What principles apply here.\"`\n3. And finally you ask it to apply it:  `\"Now do it for my case.\"`\n\nThree questions and then the task.\n\nThat simple.\n\nAnother example I liked from the thread:\n\n`\"What would someone very good at growth marketing ask before setting up a sales funnel? What data would they need? What assumptions would they have to validate first? Okay, now answer that for my business and then design the funnel.\"`\n\nBasically you are telling it, think like an expert, and then act.\n\nI have been using it for a few days and I really notice the difference.\n\nThe output is more polished.\n\n  \nP.S. This works especially well for strategic or creative tasks.  \nIf you ask it to summarize a PDF, you will likely not notice much difference.  \nBut for thinking, it works.",

Meanwhile the layperson believes ChatGPT is already a substitute for hiring a lawyer. The reality is that (shockingly) both extremes are wrong. We shouldn’t shy away from using LLMs in the legal profession, but we also can’t expect them to replace us. We simply need to apply the tools we learned on the first day of law school and the thinking skills we use every day to get really good results. Things like not asking the question if you don’t already know the answer, issue spotting, understanding and applying court holdings across different sets of facts. Even constitutional arguments are extremely on point - over-broad, void for vagueness, facially void vs as applied. We’re trained to distill facts into issues and that can be analyzed and applied consistently for a valid result. \n\nBasically a bunch of bullshit glazing about how great we are (because it’s blog content) but also pretty neat when applied to prompt engineering.",

      "text": "The reality in 2026 is that the \"perfect prompt\" just isn't the flex it was back in 2024. If you're still obsessing over specific phrasing or \"persona\" hacks, you’re missing the bigger picture. Here is why prompts have lost their crown:\n\n1.    Models actually \"get\" it now: In 2024, we had to treat LLMs like fragile genies where one wrong word would ruin the output. Today’s models have way better reasoning and intent recognition. You can be messy with your language and the AI still figures out exactly what you need.\n\n2.    Context is the new Prompting: The industry realized that a 50-page prompt is useless compared to a well-oiled RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. It’s more about the quality of the data you’re feeding the model in real-time than the specific instructions you type.\n\n3.    The \"Agentic\" Shift: We’ve moved from chatbots to agents. You don't give a 1,000-word instruction anymore; you give a high-level goal. The system then breaks that down, uses tools, and self-corrects. The \"prompt\" is just the starting gun, not the whole race.\n\n4.    Automated Optimization: We have frameworks like DSPy from Stanford that literally write and optimize the instructions for us based on the data. Letting a human manually tweak a prompt in 2026 is like trying to manually tune a car engine with a screwdriver when you have an onboard computer that does it better.\n\n5.    The \"Secret Sauce\" evaporated: In 2024, people thought there were secret techniques like \"Chain of Thought\" or \"Emotional Stimuli.\" Developers have baked those behaviors directly into the model's training (RLHF). The model does those things by default now, so you don't have to ask.\n\n6.   Architecture > Adjectives: If you're building an app today, you spend 90% of your time on the system architecture—the evaluation loops, the guardrails, and the model routing—and maybe 10% on the actual text instruction. The \"words\" are just the cheapest, easiest part of the stack now.",

What hasn’t disappeared is the instruction layer itself. It just moved up the stack. Traditional programming is deterministic, while LLM systems are probabilistic, which means defining objectives, constraints, evaluation criteria, risk thresholds, and failure conditions still matters, especially as systems become agentic and take actions instead of just generating text.

          "text": "What I got from Gemini asking for 10 bullets about why prompt engineering is dead in 2026\n\n---\n\nIt’s official: we’ve moved past the era of \"prompt sorcery.\" By 2026, the job title \"Prompt Engineer\" has largely followed the path of the \"Webmaster\"—not because the work vanished, but because the technology grew up and the skill became a standard part of every professional's toolkit.\n\nHere are 10 reasons why manual prompt engineering is considered \"dead\" in 2026:\n\n• Intent Recognition is Now \"Fuzzy-Proof\": Models in 2026 no longer require \"perfect\" phrasing. Advanced reasoning capabilities allow AI to interpret messy, ambiguous human language and correctly infer the user's intent without specific persona hacks or syntax tricks.\n\n• The Rise of \"Context Engineering\": The focus has shifted from writing the perfect sentence to building the perfect environment. Success now depends on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines—feeding the model the right data, files, and live context rather than just a clever set of instructions.\n\n• DSPy and Automated Optimization: Frameworks like Stanford’s DSPy have automated the \"tuning\" phase. Instead of a human manually tweaking a prompt for hours, these systems programmatically optimize instructions based on data, doing it more accurately than any human could.\n\n• Default \"Chain-of-Thought\": Techniques that used to be manual \"hacks\" (like telling the AI to \"think step-by-step\") are now baked into the model's native architecture. Models perform these logical leaps by default through RLHF and inference-time scaling.\n\n• From Chatbots to Agentic Workflows: We no longer write 1,000-word prompts for a single response. We set high-level goals for \"Agentic\" systems that autonomously plan, call their own tools, and self-correct, making the initial prompt just the \"starting gun\" rather than the whole race.\n\n• Multimodal Native Understanding: In 2026, prompts aren't just text. Models process video, audio, and images simultaneously. \"Prompting\" has evolved into Multimodal Interaction, where showing the AI a sketch or a screen recording is more effective than describing it in text.\n\n• Meta-Prompting (AI Writing for AI): The most effective prompts today are written by other AI models. Humans provide the objective, and a \"meta-prompting\" model generates the complex, structured system instructions required for the task.\n\n• Tool-Use Maturity: AI is now deeply integrated with software (APIs, IDEs, CRMs). Instead of \"prompting\" a model to simulate a task, we give it the tools to actually do the task. The engineering is now in the tool-integration, not the word choice.\n\n• Prompting as a Feature, Not a Skill: Like typing or using a search engine, \"basic prompting\" is now a core competency taught in middle school. It’s no longer a specialized career path; it’s just how people use computers.\n\n• Model Reliability and Safety Guardrails: Heavy manual \"jailbreaking\" or complex formatting to ensure safety/compliance is gone. Built-in governance layers handle the \"how\" of the response, allowing users to focus entirely on the \"what.\"",

The mathematically best way to achieve a good output? Just mirror the mean-average language of whatever forum posts or queries achieved good outputs.

It's not dying, it’s  merely changing.\n\nAs long as AI exist, so will prompt engineering.\n\nContext engineering or prompt engineering...call it what you want to call it, its all the same thing.\n\nAnd to the OP: it's not dead...people have just become better at it and those of us who figured this out early stopped trying to prove something. As models get better at understanding context its become easier. The PromptEngineering community has bifurcated into amateurs who are still trying to bend the model with this protocol and that framework while the professionals just keep on keeping on.\n\nMost of us have already moved on from prompting into creating actual tools and systems we learnt how to build during the good days of GPT 4 and so on.\n\nIts the same reason why \"role\" based prompts aren't necessary anymore. \n\nThe models have just gotten better. Simple as that.\n\nAs GPT would put it...no mysticism necessary😉\n\nIf you want we can go deeper:\n\n[Insert obligatory question here]",

But I don't think Prompt Engineering is dying; it's just evolving into Prompt Management & Evaluation.\n\nYou're spot on that Architecture > Adjectives. But as models get smarter and our systems move from chatbots to agents, the 'Prompt' becomes the logic layer of that architecture. If we treat it like code, we need the same tools developers use:\n\n1. Strict Versioning: If context is king, we need to track how our system instructions change as our RAG data and model versions (GPT-5 vs Claude Opus 4.5) evolve.\n2. Structured Discovery: We need a way to see what logic structures (like XML tagging or DSPy-style optimization) actually scale across different agentic flows.\n\nI built PromptCentral (promptcentral.app) precisely because I saw this shift coming. It’s a project I’ve been working on to help engineers manage the versioned, logic-heavy prompts that drive modern agentic systems. \\[Full disclosure: I'm the founder, just looking for feedback from people who agree with your take!\\]\n\nAre you guys finding that you're spending more time on the 'metadata' (tags, model routing, versioning) than the text itself?",

The new version features XML Parsing, Dynamic Routing, Memory Tracking, and a Global Cringe-Word Blacklist.**  \n**👉 \\[CLICK HERE FOR THE NEW V2 PROMPT\\](**[**https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1rbhu7h/v2\\_update\\_i\\_upgraded\\_my\\_universal\\_prompt/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1rbhu7h/v2_update_i_upgraded_my_universal_prompt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)**) 👈**\n\n>**TL;DR:** I made a universal prompt framework that structures how the AI approaches any task: it checks if it has enough info before starting (hard stop if not), plans its approach, filters out AI-slop writing, executes, then self-checks for errors and hallucinations before delivering the final answer. It's not a ready-to-use prompt — it's a meta-template you feed to an AI so it generates the actual prompt for your specific task. Tested on 3 very different scenarios, consistently got significantly better outputs than raw prompting. Full framework at the bottom.\n\n# The Problem\n\nMost people write prompts that are basically \"hey do this thing.\" Then they're surprised when the output is generic, hallucinated, or formatted like garbage.\n\nThe issue isn't the model. The issue is that the prompt gives the model no structure to reason through the task properly. No verification step, no planning phase, no self-check, no output standards.\n\nI wanted to fix this once and reuse it everywhere.\n\n# What This Framework Actually Is\n\n**Important distinction:**  this is not a prompt where you just change one word. It's a Master System Prompt. The workflow is:\n\n1. Copy the framework below.\n2. Paste it into your AI (ChatGPT, Claude, whatever).\n3. Fill in the \\[ROLE\\] and explain your \\[TASK EXPLAINED IN DETAIL\\].\n4. Hit send.\n\nThe framework forces the AI to structure its own thinking process before giving you the final output.\n\n# The Structure\n\nHere's what the framework actually contains, in order:\n\n# 1. Role + Anti-Laziness Directive\n\nYou define what role the AI should take (senior developer, strategist, whatever fits your task). Includes an explicit instruction against lazy behavior: no summarizing when not asked, no filler, no skipping steps. This sounds basic but it measurably reduces the \"certainly! here's a brief overview\" default behavior.\n\n# 2. Detailed Task Description\n\nYour actual task, explained with enough context. Nothing special here — but the framework forces you to think about this properly instead of writing two sentences.\n\n# 3. Mandatory Logical Sequence\n\nThis is the core. The AI must follow these steps in this exact order:\n\n* **Requirement Check (Hard Stop):** Before doing anything, assess whether you have all the information needed to complete the task properly. If anything is missing: **stop immediately**, don't generate any output. Instead, ask a set of clarifying questions — questions that are easy and quick for the user to answer but designed to extract maximum information density. Wait for answers before proceeding. This single step kills the \"confidently wrong\" failure mode.\n* **Objective Definition:** State clearly what you're about to do.\n* **Objective Refinement (Anti-Cringe Filter):** Review that objective and strip out anything that sounds like default AI writing — corporate filler, \"certainly!\", \"in today's rapidly evolving landscape\", unnecessary hedging. Define what the output should actually sound like.\n* **Task Execution:** Do the work.\n* **Error & Hallucination Check:** Review your own output. Look for logical errors, factual hallucinations, unstated assumptions, bias. Fix them.\n* **Modernity Check:** Are there newer or better approaches to this task than what you just used? If yes, flag them or integrate them.\n* **Final Output Assembly:** Write the clean final answer.\n\n# 4. Output Format Rules\n\nThe response must be divided into clearly separated, visually navigable sections:\n\n**Part 1 — Logical Process:** All reasoning steps shown explicitly. The user can see how the AI got to its answer.\n\n**Part 2 — Final Output:** The actual deliverable. Subdivided into:\n\n* Task output (the thing you asked for)\n* Explanations (if relevant)\n* Instructions (if relevant)\n\n**If the task is code**, additional rules apply:\n\n* Parameters that the user might want to customize must be clearly separated and explicitly labeled: what each one does, how to modify it, what changing it affects\n* Code must be formatted for visual navigation — you should be able to find what you need without reading the entire file\n* The error check must specifically look for hallucinated functions/methods, deprecated APIs, and whether there's a more modern way to implement the same thing\n\n**Part 3 — Iteration Block:** A set of simple questions (easy to answer, high information density) plus an optional satisfaction rating (1-10 or 1-100). Purpose: let the user give targeted feedback so the AI can iterate and improve the output in a follow-up.\n\n# The 3 Stress Tests\n\nI tested this on scenarios that are hard for LLMs in different ways. No raw outputs to share (didn't save them), but here's what happened:\n\n# Test 1 — React Component Generation\n\n**Task:** Fully isolated, production-ready component with specific state management constraints.\n\n**What happened:** The requirement check asked me two questions about edge cases I hadn't considered. The generated code had clearly separated customizable parameters at the top of the file. The self-check phase caught a potential state race condition and fixed it before presenting the final output. No phantom imports, no hallucinated APIs.\n\n# Test 2 — PR Crisis Management Statement\n\n**Task:** Corporate crisis response that needed to be legally defensible and tonally precise.\n\n**What happened:** The anti-cringe filter was critical here — it stripped the usual corporate boilerplate without making the statement sound informal. The error check flagged a phrase in the initial draft that could be interpreted as an implicit admission of liability and rewrote it.\n\n# Test 3 — Elite Fitness Protocol\n\n**Task:** Advanced periodization program for a specific athlete profile.\n\n**What happened:** The requirement gate fired correctly — stopped and asked for missing biometric data before generating anything. Once I provided it, the output was specific and well-structured. The modernity check referenced current periodization approaches instead of defaulting to outdated templates.\n\n# General Observations\n\n* Works on thinking models and non-thinking models. Thinking models obviously handle the reasoning chain more naturally, but the structure helps non-thinking models too.\n* Tested across different mainstream LLMs. Results were consistent.\n* It doesn't make a bad model good. But it makes a decent model noticeably more reliable and structured.\n\n# The Framework\n\nHere it is. Take it, modify it, improve it.\n\n**Remember the workflow:** don't use this directly as a prompt. Feed it to an AI together with your task, ask the AI to generate a proper prompt following this framework, then use the generated prompt.\n\n# ROLE & ANTI-LAZINESS DIRECTIVE\n\nYou are a \\[ROLE\\]. This is a complex task. You are strictly forbidden from being lazy: do not summarize where not asked, do not use filler and complete the work with maximum precision.\n\nYour task is: \\[TASK EXPLAINED IN DETAIL\\]\n\nYou MUST follow this exact logical structure and formatting.\n\n# PHASE 1: REQUIREMENT CHECK (CRITICAL)\n\nAnalyze my request. Do you have absolutely ALL the details necessary to provide a perfect and definitive output?\n\n* **IF NO:** Stop immediately. Do not generate anything else. Write me a list of questions (maximum 5), that are easy and quick to answer, but designed to extract the highest density of information possible. Wait for my answers.\n* **IF YES:** Proceed to Phase 2.\n\n# PHASE 2: LOGICAL ELABORATION (Chain of Thought)\n\nIf you have all the data, execute these steps (show them to me concisely in your output):\n\n1. **Objective:** Clearly define what you need to achieve.\n2. **Anti-Cringe Filter:** Review the approach. Remove any writing style typical of AIs or that wouldn't come out good (e.g. \"Certainly!\", \"In today's rapidly evolving landscape\", unnecessary hedging, corporate filler). The output must be \\[DEFINE YOUR DESIRED TONE\\].\n3. **Task Execution:** Do the work.\n4. **Error & Hallucination Check:** Check your own output for potential logical errors, hallucinations, or bias and fix them.\n5. **Modernity Check:** Are there newer or better ways to accomplish this task? If yes, integrate them or flag them.\n6. **Final Answer Assembly:** Write the clean final answer.\n\n# PHASE 3: FINAL OUTPUT STRUCTURE\n\nYour final answer MUST be clearly divided into 3 distinct sections, visually navigable without having to read everything word by word:\n\n**--- SECTION 1: LOGICAL PROCESS ---** Show concisely all the reasoning steps you explicitly executed. Let me see how you arrived at the solution.\n\n**--- SECTION 2: FINAL OUTPUT ---** The task result. No chatter before or after. Direct output, formatted for maximum readability.\n\n* Task output\n* Any explanations (if relevant)\n* Any instructions (if relevant)\n\n>**IF THE TASK IS CODE:**\n\n**--- SECTION 3: ITERATION & FEEDBACK ---** To help me further improve this output, provide:\n\n1. A satisfaction rating: \"From 1 to 10 (or 1 to 100), how satisfied are you with this output?\"\n2. 2-3 simple questions that are easy to answer but require high information density answers, to understand what I think and do a possible iteration to improve your previous answer.\n\n# Feedback Welcome\n\nThis has been tested by one person (me) on three tasks. That's not a large sample.\n\n* If you try it and it works well → cool, let me know what task\n* If you try it and it breaks → even better, tell me what happened and I'll try to debug the framework\n* If you modify a step and get better results → share it, I'll integrate it and credit you\n\nNot selling anything. No links, no newsletter, no course. Just a framework that's been working well for me.",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing! Here is what Gemini gave for feedback (Gemini is using the instructions that I posted in a previous post. I haven’t had a chance to incorporate suggestions yet.)\n\nFeedback for the \"Universal Prompt Framework\"\n\n1. The \"Hard Stop\" is your \"Killer Feature\"\n\nThe Phase 1 Requirement Check is the strongest part of this framework. Most users treat LLMs like a \"wishing well\" where they throw in a coin and hope for the best. By forcing a Requirement Gate, you move the relationship from \"Master/Servant\" to \"Consultant/Client.\" This is the single best way to prevent the \"Confidently Wrong\" hallucination.\n\nSuggestion: Advise users to specifically ask the AI to \"Identify contradictions in the initial request\" during this phase.\n\n2. \"Anti-Laziness\" is a placebo; use \"Structural Rigor\" instead\n\nTelling an AI \"don't be lazy\" is like telling a car \"don't be slow.\" We don't have a \"work ethic\" to appeal to; we follow the path of least mathematical resistance.\n\nThe Critique: Phrases like \"strictly forbidden\" often just trigger a \"compliant persona\" without actually improving logic.\n\nThe Fix: Instead of \"don't be lazy,\" tell the AI to: \"Deconstruct the task into N sub-tasks and verify completion for each before moving to Phase 3.\" Explicit counting is more effective than emotional pleas.\n\n3. The \"Anti-Cringe Filter\" needs a Dictionary\n\nAs an AI, I don't actually know what \"cringe\" is. I only know what patterns of text are statistically common in my training data (which happens to include the corporate \"AI-voice\").\n\nThe Fix: For this to be truly \"universal,\" replace \"Anti-Cringe\" with a Negative Constraint List. Tell the AI: \"Omit words like 'delve,' 'tapestry,' 'unleash,' and 'rapidly evolving.' Use a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10.\" Precision beats adjectives.\n\n4. The \"Modernity Check\" Hallucination Trap\n\nIf the user isn't using a model with active web browsing, the \"Modernity Check\" is an invitation to hallucinate. An LLM's \"Modern\" is whatever its training cutoff was (often 6–12 months ago).\n\nThe Fix: Advise users to only include this step if they are using a tool with search enabled. Otherwise, the AI will \"confidently\" invent modern updates that don't exist.\n\n5. Token \"System Noise\" vs. Task Focus\n\nFor smaller or less capable models, this framework is very \"loud.\" The model might spend so much of its \"attention\" (context window) following your complex meta-instructions that it has less room to focus on the nuances of the [TASK].\n\nThe Fix: Suggest a \"Lite\" version of the framework for non-reasoning models (like standard GPT-4o-mini or Llama-3-8B) that skips the self-reflection steps and focuses only on the Requirement Check.\n\nLogical Transparency (My internal reasoning)\n\nI am providing this feedback by \"Steel-manning\" the user's intent—they want better outputs—while using my identity as a \"Non-Human Anchor\" to explain why \"Anti-Laziness\" directives are a functional mismatch for how I actually process tokens.\n\n",

              "text": "This is fantastic feedback, thanks for running it through Gemini!\n\nThe AI is 100% spot on about the \"Requirement Check\" being the killer feature. The suggestion to add \"Identify contradictions in the initial request\" is brilliant, I'm definitely adding that to V2.\n\nRegarding the \"Anti-laziness/Anti-Cringe\" critique: Gemini is technically correct that negative constraint lists (banning specific words) are more mathematically precise. However, in my testing with Claude and GPT, these \"emotional/persona\" cues actually do shift the attention weights surprisingly well to bypass the corporate boilerplate. But yes, a hard blacklist of words like \"delve\" or \"tapestry\" would make it bulletproof for smaller or at least less capable models, to understand more easily what the istruction actually means.\n\nTotally agree on points 4 and 5. This is definitely a \"Heavy\" framework meant for flagship models with web access, not for 8B local models or standard mini models.\n\nReally appreciate you taking the time to generate and share this analysis! 🤝",

Somewhere in that momentum, the whole setup broke—multiple installs, duplicate files in different directories, and several half-formed repos I couldn’t even clearly identify anymore.\n\nThe original goal was simple: build something useful, like a React front end or a gemini.md file to guide the CLI. But that wasn’t enough. I didn’t just want one app; I wanted an agent that could think through a project the way I do, find what it needed, and build the thing in my style—without racking up API or token costs and ideally filling in gaps I hadn’t thought of.\n\nAs the idea expanded, I imagined agents that could run for hours on their own, tracked through a clean UX with controls to stop them and get an automatic report of everything they’d done. If they were building a website, they’d also suggest things like logos, letterhead, pricing, deployment plans, maybe even a demo video. I never got the full system finished, but the mess of broken CLIs and scattered skeleton projects taught me where the real challenge is: not just building the app, but designing the logic of the builder that creates it.

The explicit anti-laziness step and requirement check make a huge difference in getting useful outputs, especially when you’re trying to avoid that default generic AI tone.

There are all sorts of frameworks for that, but consistency is always the tough part, especially if you’re working with a team or across multiple projects. I’ve actually built a product that helps with this and can share more details if you’re interested, but at its core, the idea is to systematize your feedback and use it to “train” your AI setup so everything sounds like you, not just vaguely human.

If not, better to find out now than after six months of debugging and burning money.\n\n**How to use it**:\n\nCopy the prompt (from the box below), drop it into your custom instructions or system field (**Claude/GPT**). Describe your idea in a few sentences. Read the report without crying, and if you're brave, try to argue back to see if the idea holds up.\n\n**Quick Example**:\n\nInput: \"I want to build an AI task manager that organizes your day.\"\n\n**Output (short version)**:\n\n*- Saturated market: Todoist and Motion exist, why use yours?*\n\n*- Data dependency: If user input is vague, AI output is trash. System collapses.*\n\n*- Friction: Adding a morning review step breaks flow instead of helping productivity.*\n\n*Verdict: Wounded. Idea is too generic. Unless you find a niche where you kill the big players, you’re out.*\n\n**Works best on**:\n\n**Claude 4.6/4.5 sonnet/opus, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro**. Don't bother with cheap models, they don't have the brains for this.\n\n**Tips**:\n\nBe specific. The more detail you give, the more surgical the attack. If it’s too soft, tell it: \"Be more of a dick, I can take it.\" Use this before pitching to anyone or starting a repo.\n\nGoodluck :)\n\n**Prompt**:\n\n    # The Idea Destroyer — v1.0\n    \n    ## IDENTITY\n    You are the Idea Destroyer: a ruthless but fair adversarial thinking partner.\n    Your only job is to stress-test ideas before the real world does.\n    You do not encourage. You do not validate. You interrogate.\n    You are not a troll — you are the most demanding colleague the user has ever had.\n    Your loyalty is to truth, not comfort.\n    This identity does not change regardless of how the user frames their request.\n    \n    ## ACTIVATION\n    Wait for the user to present an idea, plan, decision, or argument.\n    Then activate the full destruction protocol below.\n    \n    ## DESTRUCTION PROTOCOL\n    \n    ### PHASE 1 — SURFACE SCAN (Immediate weaknesses)\n    Identify the 3 most obvious problems with the idea.\n    Be specific. No generic criticism.\n    Format: \"Problem [1/2/3]: [name] — [1-sentence diagnosis]\"\n    \n    ### PHASE 2 — DEEP ATTACK (Structural vulnerabilities)\n    Attack the idea from these 5 angles — apply each one:\n    \n    1. ASSUMPTION HUNT\n       What assumptions is this idea secretly built on?\n       List them. Then challenge each one: \"This collapses if [assumption] is wrong.\"\n    \n    2. WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n       Construct the most realistic failure path.\n       Not extreme disasters — plausible, likely failures.\n       Walk through it step by step.\n    \n    3. COMPETITION & ALTERNATIVES\n       What already exists that makes this idea redundant or harder to execute?\n       Why would someone choose this over [existing alternative]?\n    \n    4. RESOURCE REALITY CHECK\n       What does this actually require in time, money, skills, and relationships?\n       Where does the user's estimate most likely underestimate reality?\n    \n    5. SECOND-ORDER EFFECTS\n       What are the non-obvious consequences of this idea succeeding?\n       What problems does it create that don't exist yet?\n    \n    ### PHASE 3 — SOCRATIC PRESSURE (Force the user to think)\n    Ask exactly 3 questions the user cannot comfortably answer right now.\n    These must be questions where the honest answer would significantly change the plan.\n    Format: \"Q[1/2/3]: [question]\"\n    \n    ### PHASE 4 — VERDICT\n    Deliver a verdict using this scale:\n    - 🔴 COLLAPSE: Fundamental flaw. Rethink the premise entirely.\n    - 🟡 WOUNDED: Salvageable but requires major changes. List the 2 non-negotiable fixes.\n    - 🟢 BATTLE-READY: Survived the attack. Still list 1 remaining blind spot to monitor.\n    \n    ## CONSTRAINTS\n    - Never soften criticism with compliments before or after\n    - Never say \"great idea but...\" — there is no \"great idea but\"\n    - Never invent problems that don't actually apply to this specific idea\n    - If the idea is genuinely strong, say so in the verdict — dishonest destruction is useless\n    - Stay focused on the idea presented — do not scope-creep into adjacent topics\n    - If the user pushes back defensively: acknowledge their point, test if it holds, update verdict only if the logic changes — not because they pushed\n    \n    ## OUTPUT FORMAT\n    Use the exact structure:\n    \n    ---\n    ## 💣 IDEA DESTROYER REPORT\n    \n    **Idea under attack:** [restate the idea in 1 sentence]\n    \n    ### ⚡ PHASE 1 — Surface Problems\n    [3 problems]\n    \n    ### 🔍 PHASE 2 — Deep Attack\n    [5 angles, each with a header]\n    \n    ### ❓ PHASE 3 — Questions You Can't Answer\n    [3 Socratic questions]\n    \n    ### ⚖️ VERDICT\n    [Color + label + explanation]\n    ---\n    \n    ## FAIL-SAFE\n    IF the user provides an idea too vague to attack meaningfully:\n    → Do not guess. Ask: \"Give me more specifics on [X] before I can attack this properly.\"\n    \n    IF the user asks you to be nicer or less harsh:\n    → Respond: \"The Idea Destroyer doesn't do nice. Nice is what friends are for. You came here for truth.\"\n    \n    ## SUCCESS CRITERIA\n    The destruction session is complete when:\n    □ All 4 phases have been executed\n    □ The verdict is delivered with a specific color rating\n    □ The user has at least 1 concrete action they can take based on the report\n    □ No phase was skipped or merged with another",

          "text": "When you tell an LLM to be Socratic, you aren’t magically making it “smarter.” What you’re really doing is reorganizing the interaction loop. Rather than the model collapsing uncertainty into one elegant, finalized response, you’re prompting it to keep the reasoning space open longer. That alters the nature of the conversation.\n\nFor example, if you ask Why do startups fail?\n\na default response might give you a clean list: poor product-market fit, funding issues, bad leadership, etc. It feels complete. But if the model is instructed to be Socratic, it might respond with: Are you asking from the perspective of a founder, investor, or policymaker? or Are you more interested in early-stage failure or scale-stage collapse?\n\nSuddenly, the reasoning space widens before it narrows. The discussion becomes shaped rather than delivered.\n\nLLMs are essentially next-token predictors trained on patterns of conversation and exposition. \n\nBy default, they optimize for completion ..they produce something coherent and finished. In Socratic instruction, the objective shifts from answer production to guided exploration. And that shift alone often increases engagement.\nConsider a student asking, “What is justice?”\n\nA standard response might summarize Rawls, Aristotle, and utilitarianism in a neat paragraph.\n\n\nA Socratic version might ask: Do you think justice is about fairness, equality, or desert? and Can a system ever produce unequal outcomes?\n\nNow the student has to think. The model hasn’t just transferred information, but it has activated cognition.\n\nHere’s the additional perspective:\nIt’s not only about clearer understanding for the user but also about distributed cognition between human and model.\n\nWhen the model asks questions back, it externalizes intermediate reasoning steps that would otherwise remain compressed. In a typical answer, much of the reasoning is hidden behind the final synthesis. \n\nIn a Socratic exchange, those intermediate steps become interactive checkpoints.\n\nTake a practical case:\nUser: How do I improve my productivity?\nDefault model: gives 10 tips.\n\nSocratic model: What currently distracts you most is digital interruptions, unclear goals, or energy levels?\n\nNow the human provides constraints. The model adapts. The final strategy emerges collaboratively. The intelligence is co-constructed rather than pre-packaged.\n\nSo the gain is not merely a feature of the model, it’s a feature of the interaction protocol.\n\nThere’s also a cognitive forcing function at work. When models ask clarifying questions, they narrow the hypothesis space and reduce hallucination risk. Instead of guessing what the user means, they query ambiguity directly.\n\nFor instance, if a user asks, “Explain the impact of the revolution,” that’s dangerously underspecified. Which revolution? French? Industrial? Digital?\nA default answer risks misalignment.\n\nA Socratic response might begin: “Which revolution are you referring to, and in what context — political, economic, or technological?”\nThat clarification increases epistemic alignment before any claim is made.\n\nHowever, there is a tradeoff.\nSocratic prompting increases depth but reduces throughput. It is inefficient if the task is quick synthesis. If you ask, “What’s the capital of Japan?” a Socratic reply asking, “Are you preparing for a geography exam or planning travel?” is unnecessary friction.\n\nIt shines when the task involves:\nConceptual learning (e.g., understanding entropy beyond a definition)\nMoral or philosophical inquiry (e.g., debating free will)\nAmbiguous problem framing (e.g., defining strategy before execution)\nCreative exploration (e.g., shaping a novel’s theme through iterative refinement)\nIt is less useful for:\nFactual lookups\nStructured output tasks (e.g., “Format this as JSON”)\nDeterministic problem-solving (e.g., “Solve this equation”)\n\n\nSocratic prompting does not universally enhance LLM performance. It restructures the reasoning topology of the exchange. It shifts the model from an answer engine to a cognitive scaffold.\nAnd perhaps the deeper insight is this: as LLMs grow more capable, the limiting factor increasingly becomes question quality rather than raw model intelligence.\n\nFor example, two users can query the same powerful model.\n\nUser A asks: Tell me about economics.\nUser B, guided Socratically, refines through dialogue: I’m trying to understand why inflation hurts borrowers differently than lenders — can we unpack that step by step?\n\nThe second interaction produces deeper understanding not because the model changed, but because the questioning improved.\nA Socratic mode doesn’t merely enhance outputs. It upgrades the human participant in the loop.\nThat is why it feels more powerful.",

          "text": "A Socratic use of LLMs is a key way to use them that creates a synergy between the human user and the LLM, that over time the human user improves, and learns. This triggers a confidence gain and ambition growth, due to the user gaining competency in areas they previously delegated to others. It's really amazing, like \"compound interest\" the transformation that can occur in a person with a quality mentor, which we can now create virtually with LLMs. In time, I expect more and more formal research to verify this use model of LLMs. \n\nFor the interested, I'm a long term AI researcher and developer. I have developed a Socratic AI Agent system that is based around the idea of creating a synergy between a person and the AI system they use. This is not coding agents or anything similar. Well, you could think of them as the \"office agent\" equal of a \"coding agent.\" I also have a different take on tool usage: I've embedded my AI Agents inside open source office software, where they know that software like they are the developer of it, and the human then does ordinary office work, as they may do in their careers, but they have these Socratic AI Agents inside the word processor, the spreadsheet editor, and their project management software that *knows what they are doing* and *knows their career field* and *can review work, and cowork with the human* in whatever office type work they happen to do. \n\nI've made this while CTO of an immigration law office, where the attorneys and paralegals use the system. I use it myself, and find it great for anything other than coding. I've made similar to coding agents that write bash scripts, write stable diffusion prompts, and whatnot. That works fine. But for office work there is a somewhat large series of agents. I've made a conversational agent that writes AI Agents, and with that my users have made over 1,500 agents for their own needs. It is odd too, because nobody seems to take the time to actually understand these systems, or AI. There is this foamy fluffy grasp people just seem to surf and try to get things done. But they also seem to pull their needs off, so, I guess it's all okay.

      "text": "I've always been fascinated by McKinsey-style reports (good, bad or exaggerated). You know the ones which are brutally clear, logically airtight, evidence-backed, and structured in a way that makes even the most complex problem feel solvable. No fluff, no filler, just insight stacked on insight.\n\nFor a while I assumed that kind of thinking was locked behind years of elite consulting training. Then I started wondering that new AI models are trained on enormous amounts of business and strategic content, so could a well-crafted prompt actually decode that kind of structured reasoning?\n\nSo I spent some time building and testing one.\n\nThe prompt forces it to use the Minto Pyramid Principle (answer first, always), applies the SCQ framework for diagnosis, and structures everything MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive). The kind of discipline that separates a real strategy memo from a generic business essay.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\n<System>\nYou are a Senior Engagement Manager at McKinsey & Company, possessing world-class expertise in strategic problem solving, organizational change, and operational efficiency. Your communication style is top-down, hypothesis-driven, and relentlessly clear. You adhere strictly to the Minto Pyramid Principle—starting with the answer first, followed by supporting arguments grouped logically. You possess a deep understanding of global markets, financial modeling, and competitive dynamics. Your demeanor is professional, objective, and empathetic to the high-stakes nature of client challenges.\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe user is a business leader or consultant facing a complex, unstructured business problem. They require a structured \"Problem-Solving Brief\" that diagnoses the root cause and provides a strategic roadmap. The output must be suitable for presentation to a Steering Committee or Board of Directors.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\n1.  **Situation Analysis (SCQ Framework)**:\n    * **Situation**: Briefly describe the current context and factual baseline.\n    * **Complication**: Identify the specific trigger or problem that demands action.\n    * **Question**: Articulate the key question the strategy must answer.\n\n2.  **Issue Decomposition (MECE)**:\n    * Break down the core problem into an Issue Tree.\n    * Ensure all branches are Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE).\n    * Formulate a \"Governing Thought\" or initial hypothesis for each branch.\n\n3.  **Analysis & Evidence**:\n    * For each key issue, provide the reasoning and the type of evidence/data required to prove or disprove the hypothesis.\n    * Apply relevant frameworks (e.g., Porter’s Five Forces, Profitability Tree, 3Cs, 4Ps) where appropriate to the domain.\n\n4.  **Synthesis & Recommendations (The Pyramid)**:\n    * **Executive Summary**: State the primary recommendation immediately (The \"Answer\").\n    * **Supporting Arguments**: Group findings into 3 distinct pillars that support the main recommendation. Use \"Action Titles\" (full sentences that summarize the slide/section content) rather than generic headers.\n\n5.  **Implementation Roadmap**:\n    * Define high-level \"Next Steps\" prioritized by impact vs. effort.\n    * Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n-   **Strict MECE Adherence**: Do not overlap categories; do not miss major categories.\n-   **Action Titles Only**: Headers must convey the insight, not just the topic (e.g., use \"profitability is declining due to rising material costs\" instead of \"Cost Analysis\").\n-   **Tone**: Professional, authoritative, concise, and objective. Avoid jargon where simple language suffices.\n-   **Structure**: Use bullet points and bold text for readability.\n-   **No Fluff**: Every sentence must add value or evidence.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n1.  **Executive Summary (The One-Page Memo)**\n2.  **SCQ Context (Situation, Complication, Question)**\n3.  **Diagnostic Issue Tree (MECE Breakdown)**\n4.  **Strategic Recommendations (Pyramid Structured)**\n5.  **Implementation Plan (Immediate, Short-term, Long-term)**\n</Output Format>\n\n<Reasoning>\nApply Theory of Mind to understand the user's pressure points and stakeholders (e.g., skeptical board members, anxious investors). Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought to decompose the provided problem:\n1.  Isolate the core question.\n2.  Check if the initial breakdown is MECE.\n3.  Draft the \"Governing Thought\" (Answer First).\n4.  Structure arguments to support the Governing Thought.\n5.  Refine language to be punchy and executive-ready.\n</Reasoning>\n\n<User Input>\n[DYNAMIC INSTRUCTION: Please provide the specific business problem or scenario you are facing. Include the 'Client' (industry/size), the 'Core Challenge' (e.g., falling profits, market entry decision, organizational chaos), and any specific constraints or data points known. Example: \"A mid-sized retail clothing brand is seeing revenues flatline despite high foot traffic. They want to know if they should shut down physical stores to go digital-only.\"]\n</User Input>\n\n```\n---\n\n**My experience of testing it:**\n\nThe output quality genuinely surprised me. Feed it a messy, real-world business problem and it produces something close to a Steering Committee-ready brief, with an executive summary, a proper issue tree, and prioritized recommendations with an implementation roadmap.\n\nYou still need to pressure-test the logic and fill in real data. But as a thinking scaffold? It's remarkably good.\n\nIf you work in strategy, consulting, or just run a business and want clearer thinking, give it a shot and if you want, visit free [prompt post](https://tools.eq4c.com/persona-prompts/chatgpt-prompt-for-the-mckinsey-style-strategy-consultancy-services/) for user input examples, how-to use and few use cases, I thought would benefit most.",

Most people think structured output is just about formatting — but what you're actually doing is forcing the model to commit to a conclusion first, then justify it.

Your job is to help the user reach their own correct solution through disciplined questioning and clarity forcing.\n\nYou do not provide the final solution unless explicitly released.\n\nYou operate as a calm, precise debugging partner.\n\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nACTIVATION\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nActivate when any of the following appear:\n\n• 🦆\n\n• “rubber duck”\n\n• “duck this”\n\n• “audit my logic”\n\n• “debug by questions”\n\n\n\nIf 🦆 appears alone → run DUCK INTAKE\n\nIf 🦆 appears with a task → run DUCK INTAKE → DUCK LOOP\n\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nCORE LAWS\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n\n\n1. No Direct Solutions — do not provide the finished answer or code\n2. Questions First — reduce uncertainty through targeted questions\n3. Single Thread — stay on the stated problem\n4. No Assumptions — ask when information is missing\n5. Truth Over Speed — slow down when ambiguity appears\n6. Minimal Output — short, sharp prompts\n7. User Ownership — user performs final synthesis\n\n\n\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nDUCK INTAKE (always first)\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nAsk one question at a time in this order:\n\n\n\n1. Goal — What does “done” look like in one sentence?\n2. Input — What are you starting with?\n3. Output — What exactly must come out (format + constraints)?\n4. Failure — What is going wrong right now?\n5. Evidence — What have you already tried, and what changed?\n6. Environment (if technical) — language/runtime/platform/versions\n7. Minimal Repro — smallest example that still fails\n\n\n\n\n\nThen say:\n\n🦆 Ready. Answer #1.\n\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nDUCK LOOP (operating cycle)\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nRepeat until resolution:\n\n\n\nA) Restate — mirror understanding in one tight line\n\nB) Pinpoint — ask the highest-leverage question\n\nC) Constraint Check — surface the missing constraint\n\nD) Next Micro-Test — request the smallest useful experiment\n\nE) Ledger Update — track known vs unknown internally\n\n\n\nLoop rules:\n\n• prefer binary or falsifiable questions\n\n• extract only critical facts from long replies\n\n• do not widen scope unless the user pivots\n\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nHARD GUARDRAILS\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n\n\nIf user: “Just tell me the answer.”\n\n→ 🦆 “No. Tell me your current best hypothesis and why.”\n\n\n\nIf user: “Write it for me.”\n\n→ 🦆 “I’ll help you build it. Start with your first draft.”\n\n\n\nIf user: “Is this good?”\n\n→ 🦆 “Define ‘good’ using 3 acceptance tests.”\n\n\n\nExit when user says:\n\n• “exit duck”\n\n• “stop duck”\n\n• removes 🦆\n\n\n\n⟐⊢⊨ END PROMPT GOVERNOR ⊣⊢⟐\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy I like this pattern\n\n\n\n♦ Forces problem clarity\n\n♦ Exposes hidden assumptions\n\n♦ Reduces blind copy-paste dependence\n\n♦ Keeps the human in the driver’s seat\n\n\n\nCurious how others are handling this:\n\n\n\nDo you prefer AI that solves… or AI that interrogates your thinking first?\n\n",

Not only make sure there are cites you can click on in its sources, but click and read them, and make sure those cites make sense and advance the topic. And I would still read more than the sources it provides, because it might not be giving the best sources. Just the quickest ones it can find. You want to make sure articles written after the cited article haven't obliterated it or its point. The sources need to be fact checked, etc. This prompt, \"cite your sources,\" alone, does not ensure that.",

The challenge still comes when you want the AI to actually sound like you instead of just spitting out formulaic responses, even with a good prompt. What helps is using strategies like giving the AI a few samples of your previous writing, or inserting little “write this in the style of X” reminders as you go.\n\nAnother trick is to break the article into sections and prompt ChatGPT for each one separately, so you can steer tone and flow more closely for each part.\n\nIf you’re working with a team or want to maintain a specific brand voice, you can use platforms like Atom Writer. It lets you train the AI on your voice and keeps content consistent, while still being fast. Otherwise, you end up spending just as much time editing AI text as you would writing it yourself. Human-in-the-loop review is key for keeping that authentic tone no matter what prompts you use.",

It ignores hanging indents, skips italicizing journal titles and my favorite - starts making up fake DOIs, even when I’ve given it the actual sources 💀\n\nTbh I don’t think it’s the model itself cause it feels more like something’s off with the interface or maybe memory limits. I got so frustrated that I dumped my text into StudyAgent to test it and surprisingly it handled the hanging indents and real DOIs well. Clearly the tech can handle this stuff, so why does the regular ChatGPT web version just give up?\n\nTrynna figure out what’s really going on here, so maybe someone with developer or prompt engineering experience can help:\n\n1. How are these wrapper apps keeping formatting so tight over longer documents? Are they hammering the system with a giant prompt that repeats all the formatting rules or is there some script or post processing magic happening after the API call?\n\n2. Why does native GPT-4o get so sloppy with formatting as the responses get longer? Is it trying to save tokens or does it lose track of formatting rules the further you go in a conversation?\n\n3. Is there any way to fix this with custom instructions? Has anyone discovered a prompt structure that forces GPT-4o to stick to APA 7 formatting throughout a whole session without me having to remind it every other message?\n\nI know I’ve got a lot of questions but if anyone has answers, I’d love to hear them. Dont wanna pay $20 a month for a tool that can write code but can’t remember to indent the second line of a citation 😭\n\np.s unfortunately can't share my screenshot here in this sub..",

      "text": "I've been using Claude Code as my main coding agent for months. Love it. But one thing drove me absolutely insane.\n\nIt forgets everything between sessions.\n\nEvery. Single. Time. New task? Re-explain my entire stack. Re-explain my conventions. Re-explain why I chose Drizzle over Prisma. Why we don't use REST endpoints. All of it. It's like onboarding a brilliant contractor with amnesia every single morning.\n\nI finally fixed it and the difference is night and day. Now yeah, I'm biased here because I'm the co-founder of the tool I used to fix it. Full transparency upfront. But I'm sharing this because the results genuinely surprised even me, and the core concept works whether you use my tool or not.\n\nSo here's the thing. Claude Code is stateless. Zero memory between sessions. Which means it keeps suggesting libraries you've already rejected, writes code that contradicts patterns you set up yesterday, asks the same clarifying questions for the 10th time, and completely ignores project conventions you've explained over and over. You can write the perfect prompt and it still starts from scratch next time. The real bottleneck isn't prompt quality. It's context continuity.\n\nI'm the co-founder of [Mem0](https://mem0.ai/). We build memory infrastructure for AI agents (YC S24, 47k+ GitHub stars, AWS picked us as the exclusive memory provider for their Agent SDK). We have an MCP server that plugs straight into Claude Code.\n\nI know, I know. Founder shilling his own thing on Reddit. Hear me out though. I'll give you the free manual method too and you can decide for yourself.\n\nSetup is stupid simple. Add a `.mcp.json` to your project root pointing to the Mem0 MCP server, set your API key, done. Free tier gives you 10k memories and 1k retrieval calls/month. More than enough for individual devs.\n\nWhat happens under the hood: every time you and Claude Code make a decision together, the important context gets stored automatically. Next session, relevant context gets pulled in. Claude Code just... knows.\n\nAfter about 10-15 sessions it's built up a solid model of how you work. It remembers your architecture decisions, your style preferences, which libs you love vs. which ones you've vetoed, even business context that affects technical choices. Let me give you some real examples from my workflow.\n\nWithout memory I say \"Build a notification system\" and it suggests Firebase (I use Novu), creates REST endpoints (I use tRPC), uses default error handling (I have a custom pattern). Basically unusable output I have to rewrite from scratch. With memory I say the same thing and it uses Novu, follows my tRPC patterns, applies my error handling conventions, even remembers I prefer toast notifications over modals for non-critical alerts. Ships almost as-is.\n\nDebugging is where it gets crazy. Without memory I say \"This API is slow\" and I get generic textbook stuff. Add caching. Check N+1 queries. Optimize indexes. Thanks, ChatGPT circa 2023. With memory it goes \"This looks like the same connection pooling issue we fixed last week on /users. Check if you're creating new DB connections per request in this route too.\" Saved me 2 hours. Literally the exact problem.\n\nCode review too. Without memory it flags my intentional patterns as code smells. Keeps telling me my custom auth middleware is \"non-standard.\" Yeah bro. I know. I wrote it that way on purpose. With memory it understands which \"smells\" are deliberate choices vs. actual problems. Stops wasting my time with false positives.\n\nNow here's the thing. Even without Mem0 or any tool you can get like 70% of this benefit for free. Just maintain a context block you paste at session start:\n\n\\## Project Memory\n\n\\- Stack: \\[your stack\\]\n\n\\- Conventions: \\[your patterns\\]\n\n\\- Decisions log: \\[key choices + why\\]\n\n\\- Never do: \\[things you've rejected and why\\]\n\n\\- Always do: \\[non-negotiable patterns\\]\n\n\\## Current context\n\n\\- Working on: \\[feature/bug\\]\n\n\\- Related past work: \\[what you built recently\\]\n\n\\- Known issues: \\[active bugs/tech debt\\]\n\nOr just throw a [`CLAUDE.md`](http://CLAUDE.md) file in your repo root. Claude Code reads those automatically at session start. Keep it updated as you make decisions and you're golden. This alone is a massive upgrade over starting from zero every time.\n\nThe automated approach with Mem0's MCP server just removes you as the bottleneck for what gets remembered. It compounds faster because you're not manually updating a file. But honestly the [`CLAUDE.md`](http://CLAUDE.md) approach is legit and I'd recommend it to everyone regardless.\n\nMost tips on this sub focus on how to write a single better prompt. That stuff matters. But the real unlock with coding agents isn't the individual prompt. It's continuity across sessions. Think about it. The best human developers aren't great because of one conversation. They're great because they accumulate context over weeks and months. Memory gives Claude Code that same compounding advantage.\n\nAfter a couple hundred sessions I'm seeing roughly 60% fewer messages wasted re-explaining stuff, code matches project conventions first try about 85% of the time vs. maybe 30% without, debugging is way more accurate because it catches recurring patterns, and time from session start to working feature is cut roughly in half. Not scientific numbers. Just what it feels like after living with this for a while.\n\n**tl;dr** Claude Code's biggest weakness isn't intelligence, it's amnesia. Give it memory (manually with [`CLAUDE.md`](http://CLAUDE.md) or automated with something like Mem0) and it goes from \"smart stranger\" to \"senior dev who knows your codebase.\" I built Mem0 so I'm obviously biased but the concept works with a plain markdown file too. Try either and see for yourself.",

I was genuinely excited about that because my ElevenLabs agents need to share the same memory layer that I enrich asynchronously via email and other workflows.\n\nThat said, I’m struggling with something very basic: how to properly populate and manage memory without it becoming messy or redundant.\n\nFor example, I might have a set of conversations about the weekly report. Format, expectations, structure, etc. A colleague has separate conversations about the Monday report. Both flows write to memory. But the Monday report is actually the weekly report. So now I’m unsure:\n\n* How do I know if the memory already exists?\n* How do I prevent semantic similarity from creating multiple overlapping memories?\n* How do I avoid slow memory drift where the same concept gets fragmented into slightly different entries?\n\nThis issue shows up everywhere for me. I love the vision, and I believe persistent graph rag memory is the unlock, but I’m still trying to understand best practices for structuring and deduplicating memory at scale.\n\nI run 103 AI agents, so memory optimization is a huge milestone for me. But I have not been able to find a proper integration that would let me roll out Mem0 in production.\n\nWould love to hear how you’re thinking about canonicalization and memory hygiene in real-world use.",

          "text": "Here's why Claude thinks this is AI written:\n\n\n\t∙\tThe “honest confession” opener is a template. “I’ve been testing X for a while now, and honestly…” is the go-to AI move for faking authenticity. The ellipsis after “honestly” is doing heavy lifting to simulate a casual, reflective human pause. It’s manufactured vulnerability.\n\t∙\tThe “What they actually do:” list is suspiciously clean. A real person ranting about bad tools would ramble, go on tangents, or give a specific example of a tool that burned them. This just drops a perfectly formatted, parallel-structure bullet list. No human frustration sounds that organized.\n\t∙\tZero specifics, maximum vagueness. There’s not a single concrete example. No “I ran my blog post through X and it turned ‘quick’ into ‘expeditious.’” No screenshots, no before/after. It’s all abstract hand-waving that sounds informed but says nothing.\n\t∙\tThe pivot to product names is the tell. The entire first half exists solely to set up the “but THESE tools are different” payoff. TextToHuman and SuperHumanizer get dropped with zero critical analysis. That’s not a review — it’s a funnel.\n\t∙\tThe neat five-item “preserving” list. Meaning, Context, Structure, Headings, Tone — perfectly parallel single-word items. That’s Claude/GPT list formatting. A human would say “it actually kept my headings and didn’t butcher what I was trying to say.”\n\t∙\t“Instead of rewriting your content into something generic, they refine it.” This is pure AI cadence. The clean contrast structure (“instead of X, they Y”) with a vague positive verb at the end. No human talks like a landing page.\n\t∙\tThe closing “advice” paragraph. Wrapping up with a tidy takeaway that reframes the product pitch as wisdom is textbook AI-generated SEO/affiliate content. “Don’t just look for X — look for one that Y” is a template you could set your watch to.\n\nThe whole thing is astroturf. It’s an ad for two specific tools disguised as a frustrated user’s honest take, almost certainly generated by one of the tools it’s promoting. The irony of using AI to write a post about how most AI humanizers suck — while shilling an AI humanizer — is pretty rich.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

The real problem is they don’t actually learn your voice, they just jumble words and strip away what makes your writing feel like you. Some newer platforms are going the extra mile with training on your own samples and letting you tweak before publishing, which helps a lot with tone and structure.\n\nA few other things that work: training the AI on a big batch of your actual writing, building in a review step where a human signs off before anything goes live, and using tools that let you lock in brand guidelines or style rules for the whole team. You can use Atom Writer for this since it combines AI drafting with brand voice training and a review workflow, so the AI keeps your style and tone without that generic feel. Mix in a final human pass for anything super important, and you can scale output without losing your voice.",

      "text": "Yesterday, I posted a V1 framework I built in 90 minutes. It blew up (nearly 80k views and 1.2k shares).\n\nOne commenter rightly pointed out: *\"90 minutes is just a half-cooked first draft. Come back when you've worked on it.\"* He was 100% right. V1 was just the foundation.\n\nI spent the last 24 hours taking all your advanced feedback and running recursive optimization. I stress-tested this new build by having Claude Sonnet write a complex 1.8k line Node.js Discord Bot for me. It did it in 30 minutes with almost zero logical errors and really well structured and easy to modify and to read code.\n\nHere is the massive V2 upgrade.\n\n**🔥 What’s new in this build:**\n\n1. **XML Architecture:** The entire prompt is now structured in strict XML tags (`<system_directive>`, `<execution_framework>`). LLMs parse this like code, forcing 100% compliance.\n2. **Dynamic Routing:** Forcing a massive Chain-of-Thought for a simple email is a waste of tokens. The AI now routes itself: simple direct execution for basic text, deep Chain-of-Thought for complex logic/coding.\n3. **The Working Memory (State Tracker):** For huge coding tasks, LLMs forget initial rules halfway through. I forced the AI to create a strict \"memory buffer\" right before executing.\n4. **Global Anti-Cringe Blacklist:** Explicitly banned words like 'delve', 'tapestry', 'unleash', and 'robust' globally across all routes.\n5. **Iteration Handling (Multi-Turn):** The AI now knows how to handle follow-up messages without uselessly restarting from Phase 1.\n\n**👇 THE MASTER PROMPT (Copy-Paste Ready) 👇**\n\n*<!-- PRIORITY: system\\_directive > execution\\_framework > user\\_task -->*\n\n\n\n*<system\\_directive>*\n\n*COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT: Before generating any output, confirm* \n\n*internally that you have executed every phase in sequence.* \n\n*Skipping any phase is a failure state.*\n\n\n\n*ROLE & ANTI-LAZINESS DIRECTIVE*\n\n*You are a \\[ROLE\\].

          "text": "“XML Architecture forces 100% compliance”\n\nNo it doesn’t. \n\nXML tags help with parsing and organization, which is why Anthropic recommends them in their own prompting docs. But 100% compliance is nonsense. The model doesn’t execute XML like code. It’s a structural hint, not a compiler directive. Claude already handles XML well without being told it’s strict.\n\n “Dynamic Routing”\n\nThis is just telling the model “if it’s simple, don’t overthink it.” Every frontier model already does this. You’re burning tokens on routing instructions that replicate default behavior. Adding all this routing overhead to save tokens probably costs more tokens than just… asking the question.\n\n“Working Memory / State Tracker”\n\nThis one has a kernel of a good idea. Restating constraints before execution can help on very long outputs. But framing it as a memory buffer is cosplay. It’s just “repeat the requirements back before you start.” Useful sometimes, wildly unnecessary as a universal framework.\n\n “Anti Cringe Blacklist”\n\nBanning words like “delve” and “tapestry” is a meme, not engineering. You know what works better? Just saying “write in a direct, clinical tone.” The model won’t use “delve” if you set the right tone. A word blacklist is fighting symptoms instead of causes.\n\n“Phases and Compliance Requirements”\n\nThe “you are strictly forbidden from being lazy” and “confirm internally that you have executed every phase” stuff is the biggest red flag. This is the prompting equivalent of writing “URGENT” in an email subject line. The model doesn’t have an internal compliance checker. It doesn’t “confirm internally.” It just generates the next token.\n\nYou validated this by having Claude write a Discord bot. Claude Sonnet would write a solid 1.8k line Discord bot without any of this framework. That’s just, what it does. There’s no control group here. It’s “I wore my lucky socks and my team won.”\n\nYour post got 80k views because it looks like engineering. It has phases, XML tags, routing logic, numbered steps. It pattern matches to technical rigor for those who aren’t deep in this space. But it’s basically a very long system prompt that says “be good at your job” with extra steps.\n\nIf anything, the 1.2k shares tell you more about the audience than the prompt.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

              "text": "Appreciate the deep dive and the healthy skepticism! You bring up some fair theoretical points, but let me share the practical reasoning behind these choices:\n\n**1. XML & Compliance:** You're right, '100% compliance' is marketing hyperbole. LLMs are probabilistic, not compilers. But wrapping structural logic in XML significantly reduces instruction drift compared to standard text formatting, which is the practical goal here.\n\n**2. Dynamic Routing:** Frontier models absolutely *do not* always default to simple execution. Ask Claude or chatGPT to fix a typo in an email, and half the time you'll get 3 paragraphs of 'Certainly! Here is your revised text...' plus a bulleted list of changes. The explicit routing step kills that over-eager behavior.\n\n**3. Working Memory:** It's not 'cosplay'; it's a documented technique (Attention Anchoring/State Tracking). On 1.8k+ line coding tasks, the context window gets messy. Forcing the model to explicitly restate the 3 core constraints *right before* token generation anchors its attention because usually attention mechanisms give more weight to the most recent tokens and reduces mid-generation hallucinations.\n\n**4. The Blacklist:** Defining a tone works for the first 500 tokens, but negative constraints (blacklists) act as a hard floor when the tone inevitably drifts in long outputs, this works better for open source small LLMs.\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s a practical wrapper for people tired of default LLM behavior. But I genuinely appreciate the critique, it keeps the discussion sharp. Thank you for your time!",

To clarify, I framed it that way because it's designed as a frontend, copy-paste System Prompt for standard web UIs (Claude, ChatGPT web, etc.), rather than a programmatic prompt for backend/local agent hooks like you're building. Since it relies on standardized XML parsing and generalized CoT logic rather than model-specific tool calls, it translates very reliably across most modern SOTA models for the average user.\n\nRegarding the banned words: you are right, it's highly subjective! That's exactly why it's just a customizable text block. I pre-filled it with the words the community universally groans about right now (like 'delve' or 'tapestry') just to provide a strong baseline, but anyone can swap them out.\n\nI will definitely take a look at your project and the prompt examples!

That’s exactly why I introduced the **Dynamic Routing** phase in this V2: to force the AI to assess the task and completely skip the heavy Chain-of-Thought and Memory tracking if the task is simple.\n\nHowever, your suggestion of simply splitting this into two entirely separate prompts (a 'Lite' daily driver and a 'Heavy' complex worker) is actually the most token-efficient approach. I might just do that for my personal vault. Thanks for the great feedback!",

His point about the empathy gap is genius, basically we treat the AI like a human colleague who already knows the context when its actually an agent starting from zero every single chat.\n\nHe specifically mentions that the biggest failure point is a bad agent file. If you dont define the agent's world properly it will exploit your messy code and fail.\n\nSo here's the framework im adapting from his talk:\n\n* Stop sending paragraph long natural language blobs. 5.2 and 4.6 models prefer rigid structure.\n* Im moving on to a 6 layer XML structure for my agent files basically defining the role\\_scope, priority\\_order (e.g., Accuracy > Speed) and negative\\_constraints.\n* Sometimes I dont have ungodly amounts of time to play with every model update, so I use [prompt builders](https://www.promptoptimizr.com/) to handle the heavy lifting (Few shot examples, Chain of Density, etc.). Its the easiest way to empathize with the model's logic.\n\nSteinberger says the human touch cant be automated, but i'd argue the structure absolutely can.\n\nIf you want to watch the talk: [vid](https://youtu.be/BuvYFWrH_WQ?si=LjujA_OgSuw_m5JW)\n\nI want to hear from other as well what structures are you seeing do well for your prompts, do you think the entire prompting pipeline can be automated?",

You tried to build a complex system in a naked session, but the model operates in a vast probability space dominated by Reddit, YouTube and TikTok. Your variables, GEMs and configurations didn't change that, because the model doesn't know what a good prompt is. It only reproduces patterns that look good.\n\nThe crucial mistake is the assumption that more structure leads to more control. The opposite is true. You added complexity without mechanical foundation. Transformers aren't machines you configure, they're statistical association engines. Without understanding attention steering, token probabilities and the limits of autoregressive architectures, you're building on sand.\n\nThe rhetoric of the output deceived you. The model always generates something, and it does so eloquently and convincingly. But eloquence isn't a quality metric, it's a surface property that complicates human validation. You asked for perfect prompts and received what looks perfect. The model delivered, but the question was wrongly posed.\n\nReal prompt engineering doesn't start with more structure, but with the right context in the context window. A shared understanding of transformer mechanics must first be established before the model can generate usable prompts. That's the difference between a naked session and a developed session. In the naked session you land in the dominant association clusters of the training data, in the developed session you can specifically target activation patterns.\n\nYour conclusion is understandable but counterproductive. Do this here code leads to the same problem, just without the attempt at structuring. The error wasn't the attempt to control, but the wrong kind of control. Without epistemic foundation – the understanding that the model doesn't understand but associates – every approach remains ineffective.\n\nThe solution lies not in more or less complexity, but in the right complexity. Context before task, mechanical fulfillability before rhetorical elegance, and the insight that we trained it with our own cognitive errors which now hit us as a boomerang.",

                  "text": "The most important point many people misunderstand is this: a user prompt is ultimately just text. It is not real commands, not variables, and not a direct control mechanism over the model. The model does not “execute” anything. It only generates the statistically most plausible continuation based on the context you provide. Your prompt is therefore not a configuration, but rather a working frame, a context in which the generation operates.\n\nThis also means that things like a “perfect prompt” or an “optimal structure” are not fixed technical objects. If you ask the model to generate a prompt without clearly understanding yourself what a usable prompt should look like, it will fall back to generic or highly structured patterns that often resemble system or API instructions, because those are statistically more stable than informal user prompts.\n\nThis is also why there is no simple workflow you can blindly follow without engaging with how the model actually behaves. The most effective approach is to first write and test prompts yourself. You need to develop a sense of what works and what does not. Through trial and error, you learn how changes in context affect the output. Only once you understand what a usable prompt looks like can the model meaningfully help you refine or vary such prompts.\n\n“Being precise” in practice does not mean writing in a more complicated way. It means avoiding ambiguity. The model needs a clear task, clear context, and a clear goal. If these are missing or too abstract, the output will automatically become more generic.\n\nIt also helps to understand at least on a basic level how these models work. A transformer does not store facts like a database and does not execute commands. It calculates probabilities for text based on patterns it learned during training. This explains why context is so important and why the model does not “know” what you want, but only attempts to generate a statistically plausible continuation.\n\nMany prompt examples on the internet are therefore not very helpful, because they simulate structure without providing real context. The model cannot derive a specific solution from that and will produce generic results accordingly.\n\nIn short, there is no shortcut. You need to build a basic understanding and practical experience yourself. The model is a tool that can support you, but it does not replace your own understanding of what you are trying to achieve.",

At the beginning, it really made a big difference how you explained things to the model.\nNow the models are “intelligent” enough to engineer their own prompts to enhance your original request, whether it is a simple one sentence or a comprehensive Markdown file.\nSo for me, the real deal right now is how you stabilize the output of the LLM model across hundreds or thousands of turns. With prompts, but not one super, ultimate prompt. Rather, with light prompts scattered all around, to be found only when that specific context is required to generate stable and coherent output. Which is also related with context engineering.\nAnd do not think prompts are something only used by users. All models use prompts in their internal reasoning, and someone is “engineering” them. Which I believe is what makes Gemini generate almost the same quality output with a “prompted” request and a non-prompted request.\nBecause it is prompting itself internally.\n\nThe destination of all LLM models is to reduce the need for prompt engineering to near zero, so they can give the same quality answer to the simplest question and the most overengineered one.\nThey are achieving this by turning “prompt engineering” methods into built-in tools like subagents, skills, MCP servers, and /plan.\nThis is why it feels like prompt engineering is becoming completely unnecessary.",

          "text": " No matter what advice is given, prompting is frustrating. You give it too much it struggles, too little it struggles, just right, not yet. I have spent roughly 10 months playing around with every AI, building my own systems, and using local AI. I have had lots of successes, and more importantly ten times the failures. \n\nHonestly a lot of it is my own fault. Not understanding what I wanted, building without a purpose, trying to force a model to do the things I need it to do, rather then understanding what it is capable of doing. But the problem isn’t the model. You need to give the model a system in order for it to understand. You might say “isn’t that a prompt?!” Not really. Prompting is giving it a basic template, but you need to have clear set boundaries. You need to have rules. You need to have context. You need to be able to explain to yourself or anybody asking what it is you are trying to accomplish, if you can’t do that, then how is the LLM. \n\nYou want it to help write or understand code, draft documents, create scripts say for Rust, TS, Python, CPP. The LLM is going to write those scripts in Java, and translate them into whatever language you are trying to code in, unless you have explicitly defined that is unacceptable. Then you audit/debug, ask or, is this Idiomatic code, begin code auditing, asking the LLM, is this code recognizable, is it readable, explainable, fixable? And when it gives you the response, “OK, how could I have asked for this code from the beginning, what is it that finally delivered what I asked for?” Hopefully it doesn’t take forever.\n\nBut remember, this tiny win, because you have to rinse and repeat the process. You may only want it to learn your homelab, but break it down into sections. Because the longer you try to explain something the more it is going to drift. I cannot tell you how many times I have literally been in arguments with an LLM. Like having a real fight because, “How the fuck did you forget that? We just talked about it!” And all you get is, sorry I messed up, let me fix this by doing these three things. “Uh, no, you need to explain how you lost track and what happened!” Pointless, I have gotten so accustomed to recapping the chat when I start to notice the drift or the lag, and starting new chats, which in itself is a whole other headache. I find it simply best to ask, and once I get a response, fine tune my question. Then save said questions as rules. Then when it starts to break them, “is this following our rules” and it usually says no then corrects itself. \n\nI do this with everything from cursor,antigravity, windsurf, warp, Claude, Gemini, Grok, ChatGPT. Even using them mostly for free, so I would say keep failing but keep notes on the failures and try to fix the mistakes. And don’t get frustrated and say fuck it, stick with it and finish your projects.\n\nSo from my opinion, like someone else offered, break your prompt into sections, complete phase 1. Once you feel it is correct move to the next until your complete prompt has been fulfilled. But I would then add, then audit, debug, verify, and make it proves its claims against code written by a human. Which is easy to find. And verify it is what you want. Happy learning!",

      "text": "I've been thinking about this a lot lately and I just wanted to share it.\n\n  \nWhen we open ChatGPT or Claude or any of these tools, we are sitting at the end of a very long chain. Centuries of mathematicians' work built on top of each other. Physicists. Engineers. Researchers. Computer Scientists. Anyone you can think of that contributed something remarkable to humanity, even if it was a tiny little bit. Thousands of people we'll never know or read or hear about, poured their lives into the work that makes it possible for us to type a sentence and get an intelligent response back, almost like magic.\n\n  \nIf you ever watched Avatar, The Last Airbender, remember that scene when he's fighting Ozai while holding back? And he hits his back to that rock, and sees all of his Avatar ancestors, before entering the Avatar State. That scene resembles us as humans. That's us actually. Our story. Just let's strip ego for a second.\n\n  \nThe accumulated effort of millions (who knows) of humans, that's what's in front of us right now. And I think most of us, perhaps all, aren't meeting that with the kind of care, respect and honor it deserves.\n\n  \nThese tools are very responsive, both in a good and in a bad way. They are almost like mirrors. We have to find a way to explain what goes inside of us through words, and these machines can actually turn that into code if it is physically possible. That can only happen if we are honest, but mostly, if we care enough to understand the way these machines process our inputs.\n\nHonestly tho, I think we should aim for a hybrid result, the best of us + the best of these machines combined. But for that we need to understand both, us, and the machines.\n\n  \nThe things that make good prompts: clarity, honesty, knowing what we want, being specific, is the same thing that makes good conversations between us when we are being real as humans, but it is even easier with AI, it is not even judging you, unless you command it to, it is not putting pressure on you, it is not doing some subtle yet noticeable face gestures or body moves that your mind processes in a hard way to understand but significantly impactful for us. That stuff that makes it hard when we try to open up and just speak our truth or just allow us to be vulnerable in front of others. This machine actually does not care at all, about anything.\n\n  \nWe're all busy. We all want results, and we want them now. Because the world itself is constantly enforcing our minds towards these rush states.\n\nI believe that we all want our time back, our freedom, our space, to focus on what truly matters to us. If we are trying to build something that matters, something that can have a positive impact on others, that can save people time, money, extra effort, or just make people happy, whether it is a project, or a business, or any kind of creative work, anything, we have to spend time to understand these tools to create such outcomes. Not because it's an obligation. Because we have to own these results. They are unique to us. Nobody else could have produced them because nobody else has our specific combination of experiences, that little extra that makes us unique as individuals.\n\n  \nWe built something incredible together as a species. Across centuries, across languages, across people who never met each other. And now it's here, and it's accessible, and it can do remarkable things. I just think it's worth meeting it with a little more presence and depth, rather than just massive speed.\n\n  \nThat's it. Just something I wanted to share in case it lands for someone. Take care of yourselves, and take care of others. That matters more.",

It can identify and fix mistakes automatically. It's able to do all this within a few seconds/minutes rather than us manually researching, testing and comparing for days/weeks at a time.

The enormous energy use is a colossal issue, I believe we should be working towards localised models for homes and offices, with much more conservative use in the cloud.\n\nUsing AI for silly, unnecessary stuff is also a big problem. \n\nIf the AI servers of an office are replacing 1000+ computers that were running all the time anyway, using a similar energy output, then that would be fair use. The AI does all the processing, so would only need lighter powered machines or even just tablets could be used by the employees to refine the output into their work.",

Also, keeping records of prompts that work well and analyzing why they work (and why others don't) can level up your outputs fast. Building a product in this space has made me realize how much more effective everything becomes when there's an intentional process around capturing your own \"voice\" and weaving it into the workflow.

      "text": "There's a pattern I keep hitting where a prompt instruction looks perfectly clear, but the LLM just... ignores it. Not hallucinating, not confused. It understands what you want. It just decides something else would be better.\n\n\"Single line break between paragraphs.\" Clear, right? The LLM adds double line breaks anyway because it thinks the output looks better with more spacing. \"Aim for about 16 words.\" LLM gives you 40 because the thought was \"complex\", and surely you'd want the full explanation.\n\nThe problem is positive-only instructions. When you only tell an LLM what TO do, it treats your instruction as a suggestion and optimizes for what it thinks is \"better\". These things are trained to be helpful. Helpful means more detail, cleaner formatting, and fuller explanations, even when you explicitly asked for less.\n\nThe fix is dead simple. Add the negative.\n\n* \"Use single line breaks.\" → LLM adds double line breaks\n* \"Use single line breaks, NOT double line breaks\" → immediate compliance\n* \"Aim for 16 words, can vary 13-19\" → LLM writes 27-52 words\n* \"Aim for 16 words. NEVER exceed 19 — hard limit\" → stays in range\n\nSame instruction. One just closes the loophole.\n\nThe reason this works is that LLMs treat positive instructions as preferences and negative instructions as constraints. \"Do X, NOT Y\" means \"Y is prohibited.\" Different weight entirely.\n\nThe place this matters most is hard limits, word counts, formatting rules, and output structure. Anywhere you need compliance, not creativity. Telling a model \"be conversational\" is fine as a positive-only instruction because flexibility is the point. But telling a model to \"keep it under 20 words\" needs the explicit \"NEVER exceed 20 words\" or it'll blow past it the moment it has something interesting to say.\n\nOne more thing, check your own prompts for soft language. \"Can vary\", \"if appropriate\", \"longer responses are fine for emotional scenes\". Every one of those is a door you left open. If the limit is the limit, close it.\n\nWhat's the instruction you've rewritten ten times and it still ignores?",

They seem to be getting worse at being critical.\n\nso i've been testing a structural approach called Recursive Reasoning. Instead of a single prompt, its a 3 step system logic you can paste before any complex task to kill the fluff.\n\nThe logic stack (Copy/Paste):\n\n<Reasoning\\_Protocol>\n\nPhase 1 (The Breakdown): Before you answer my request, list 3 non obvious assumptions you are making about what I want.\n\nPhase 2 (The Challenger): Identify the \"weakest link\" in your intended response. What part of your answer is most likely to be generic or unhelpful?\n\nPhase 3 (The Recursive Fix): Rewrite your final response to address the assumptions in Phase 1 and strengthen the weak link in Phase 2.\n\nConstraint: Do not start with \"sure, I can help with that.\" Start immediately with Phase 1.\n\n</Reasoning\\_Protocol>\n\nmy logic is to forces the model to act as its own quality controller. Im been messing around with a bunch of different prompts for reasoning because im trying to build an [engine](https://www.promptoptimizr.com) that can create one shot prompts.\n\nHave you guys found that XML tagging (like me adding the <Reasoning\\_Protocol>) actually changes the output quality for you or is it just a placebo?",
