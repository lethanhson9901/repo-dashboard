      "text": "After months of testing, I realized that 90% of bad ChatGPT outputs come from the same problem: we write prompts like Google searches instead of project briefs.\n\nHere's the framework I developed and use for every single prompt I build:\n\nROLE → CONTEXT → TASK → FORMAT → CONSTRAINTS\n\nLet me break it down with real examples:\n\nLayer 1: ROLE (Who is ChatGPT being?)\n\nDon't just say \"you are an expert.\" Be specific about the expertise level, the industry, and the personality.\n\nBad: \"You are a marketing expert\"\n\nGood: \"You are a direct-response copywriter with 15 years of experience writing for DTC e-commerce brands. You specialize in high-converting email sequences and have studied Eugene Schwartz and David Ogilvy extensively.\"\n\nThe more specific the role, the more specific the output. ChatGPT adjusts its vocabulary, structure, and reasoning based on this layer.\n\nLayer 2: CONTEXT (What's the situation?)\n\nGive background. ChatGPT cannot read your mind. The context layer is where most people lose quality.\n\nExample: \"My client sells a $49 organic skincare serum targeted at women aged 28-42 who are frustrated with products that promise results but use synthetic ingredients. The brand voice is warm, confident, and science-backed   not salesy.\"\n\nLayer 3: TASK (What exactly do you want?)\n\nBe painfully specific about the deliverable.\n\nBad: \"Write some emails\"\n\nGood: \"Write a 5-email welcome sequence. Email 1 is a warm brand introduction. Email 2 addresses the #1 objection (price). Email 3 shares a customer transformation story. Email 4 introduces urgency with a limited-time offer. Email 5 is a final nudge with social proof. Each email should have a subject line, preview text, and body.\"\n\nLayer 4: FORMAT (How should it look?)\n\nTell ChatGPT the exact structure.\n\nExample: \"For each email, use this structure: Subject Line | Preview Text | Opening Hook (1 sentence) | Body (100-150 words) | CTA (one clear call to action). Use short paragraphs   no paragraph longer than 2 sentences.\"\n\nLayer 5: CONSTRAINTS (What should it avoid?)\n\nThis is the secret weapon. Constraints prevent generic output.\n\nExample: \"Do not use the words 'revolutionary', 'game-changing', or 'unlock'. Do not start any email with a question. Do not use exclamation marks more than once per email. Write at an 8th-grade reading level.\"\n\nFull prompt using all 5 layers combined:\n\nYou are a direct-response copywriter with 15 years of experience writing for DTC e-commerce brands. You specialize in high-converting email sequences and have studied Eugene Schwartz and David Ogilvy extensively.\n\nMy client sells a $49 organic skincare serum targeted at women aged 28-42 who are frustrated with products that promise results but use synthetic ingredients. The brand voice is warm, confident, and science-backed   not salesy.\n\nWrite a 5-email welcome sequence. Email 1: warm brand introduction. Email 2: address the #1 objection (price). Email 3: customer transformation story. Email 4: limited-time offer with urgency. Email 5: final nudge with social proof.\n\nFor each email use this structure: Subject Line | Preview Text | Opening Hook (1 sentence) | Body (100-150 words) | CTA (one clear call to action). Use short paragraphs   no paragraph longer than 2 sentences.\n\nDo not use the words \"revolutionary,\" \"game-changing,\" or \"unlock.\" Do not start any email with a question. No more than one exclamation mark per email. Write at an 8th-grade reading level.\n\nThe output you get from this vs. just saying \"write me some emails\" is night and day.\n\nHere are 3 more fully built prompts using this framework:\n\nThe Strategy Audit Prompt:\n\nYou are a startup advisor who has helped 50+ companies go from 0 to $1M ARR. You specialize in digital products and solo-creator businesses. I'm going to describe my current business. Audit my strategy and give me: 1) The 3 biggest risks you see, 2) The #1 thing I should double down on, 3) What I should stop doing immediately, 4) A 30-day action plan with weekly milestones. Be direct and specific   no motivational fluff. If my strategy is bad, say so.\n\nThe Content Angle Generator:\n\nYou are a viral content strategist who has studied the top-performing posts on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram for the last 3 years. My niche is \\[topic]. Generate 10 unique content angles I haven't thought of. For each angle, give me: the hook (first line), the core insight, and why it would perform well. Avoid cliché angles like \"5 tips for...\" or \"here's what nobody tells you.\" I want original, surprising perspectives that make people stop scrolling.\n\nThe Customer Avatar Deep Dive:\n\nYou are a consumer psychologist and market researcher. My product is \\[describe product and price]. Build me a detailed customer avatar that includes: demographics, psychographics (values, fears, aspirations), the exact language they use to describe their problem (not marketer language   real words from real people), where they hang out online, what they've already tried that failed, and the emotional trigger that would make them buy today. Write it as a strategic document, not a generic persona template.\n\nI've been building a full library of prompts using this exact framework across marketing, productivity, business strategy, content creation, and more.\n\nThis framework works. Try it on your next prompt and compare the output to what you were getting before   you'll see the difference immediately.\n\nWhat frameworks do you all use? Curious if anyone approaches it differently.\n",

          "text": "Your Layer 5 is doing more work than you realize. What you’re calling ‘constraints’ is actually the most technically interesting part of this framework — you’re modifying the model’s output probability distribution rather than just steering its reasoning.\nThe reason ‘do not use X word’ works so well isn’t just about avoiding clichés. You’re collapsing regions of the token probability space, which forces the model to redistribute attention weight toward less default outputs. That’s why constrained prompts feel more ‘professional’ — you’re literally making the lazy outputs unreachable.\nWhat gets interesting is when you formalize this beyond simple word exclusions. There are at least five distinct constraint types that operate differently on the output space — void regions (what you’re already doing), mutual exclusions (if A then never B), binary verification gates, negation requirements, and representation closure. Layering these creates compound constraint geometry that’s qualitatively different from just stacking more ‘don’t do X’ rules.\nYour framework is solid for creative/marketing work. The question I’d pose to this community: what happens when constraints aren’t preferences but requirements? Finance, healthcare, legal — domains where ‘the model usually respects this’ isn’t acceptable. That’s where constraint architecture becomes a fundamentally different discipline from prompt engineering.",

Then combine that with your framework and it gets crazy close to sounding human.

Otherwise, I have a \"base-prompt.md\" and \"shutdown.md\" that I use for Claude Code. base-prompt gets the project started, gets the structure set, and has the prompt that points to my PRD. Then shutdown.md has shutdown instructions as far as updating \"to-do.md\", \"readme.md\", \"claude.md\" and other relevant documents and then I close out the sessions. \n\nThis is a good way to not type everything over and over, but also make sure sessions are kept tight and hyper focused. I feel quality degrades significantly the more and more context that gets built. With the addition of memory in claude code some of this is somewhat redundant, however memory is specific to the machine you're on, so doing the shutdown process and updating all documentation makes it much easier to pickup right where I left off when I transfer to desktop and back to laptop and so on.

          "text": "I both agree with this lecture but also disagree. \n\n<rant>\n\nGood output is (and has always been) a consequence of good input, but the users prompt is only part of the input...\n\n1. System prompt - overall guidance on personality and subject\n\n2. Domain input - e.g. the existing code base, RAG.\n\n3. The user's prompt.\n\n4. MCPs and other subject expert sources\n\n5. Rules, workflows and skills\n\n6. The language model itself.\n\n7. History/memory of what has already been done.\n\n8. Context management.\n\nOnly number 3 is written every time, and it doesn't have to be written entirely by the user - AI in planning mode can write a detailed prompt based on a simpler user prompt.\n\nAnd it can do that best when all the other items in the list pre-exist and are quality. \n\nSo you can have rules or workflows that say how a single user requirement should be processed. You can start with a simple prompt and AI can ask questions and enhance the prompt into a more detailed requirement (goal),  specification (what to produce) and plan (how to produce it to the right quality) which the user  needs to approve before AI gets on with the actual coding. And the system prompt, domain and expert knowledge etc. are as important input into the planning as into the production run. \n\nAnd having the AI effectively record what it has already done it tried and having it clear it's context and start again with the knowledged already gained is another important aspect.\n\nAnd IMO, the definition of Prompt Engineering is getting all of the above right not just the user's written prompt.\n\nSo you need to craft the overviews, the roles and workflows, you need to define the process that the AI follows, telling the childlike AI how to break it down into steps, how to record progress and pass results of one step onto another that otherwise starts afresh like a goldfish that has completed a lap of the bowl..\n\nYou also need to define how the AI gets is domain knowledge (existing source code, exposure in Frameworks or languages, MCP servers, rag etc.) and not leave the AI guessing. \n\nIn my (extremely limited) experience with AI, you can burn a lot of tokens for not a lot of quality output if you don't do all of the above. \n\nWhat surprises me is that so little of this is predefined. The software development lifecycle has both a lot of theory and a lot of practical experience, and a lot of literature about it. Yes, there are lots of minor alternatives - so you might need a few preferred prompts to choose from - but it's crazy that we are expected to reinvent the wheel. \n\nOut of the box, you seen to get none of this. And so people use it like Google because they are not guided otherwise and burn a whole shitload of tokens before giving up or painful learning.\n\nAnd though I am absolutely not an expert on llms, it does seem crazy to me that an apprentice coding LLM will understand 100 spoken languages, and 20 computer language and goodness knows what else, so that when I write English it burns inference cycles working out whether it means in Spanish, Italian and French, and when I want JavaScript code it has to reject all sorts of python and php probabilities. Surely we could have an English and web languages coding LLM (of say 8B tokens) instead of a polyglot be all and do all single LLM of 500B tokens. \n\nSo yes, we might also need different specialised llms for planning, design, and coding and running tests/diagnosing failures, but routing queues to the right LLM shouldn't be that hard these days.\n\n </rant>",

We ended up encoding our quality standards as ESLint rules instead. If the output contains \"we're thrilled\" or \"don't hesitate to reach out\", it fails the build. Can't ignore a build failure. The lint error messages also feed back as context, so the AI starts self-correcting after a few rounds.",

Similar to Matt's content - Sometimes they may dig a bit deeper into the tools and breakdown.\n\nAlso check out Peter H. Diamandis’ channel — he tracks the latest AI news and politics with a weekly panel that sometimes includes Emad Mostaque (former Stability AI CEO). It’s a great mix of insight and debate from people actually in the AI space.\n\nAlso on Spotify \"AI Applied\" both of the guys on that Podcast also get into all the tools for building stuff and not super technical, so anybody can listen in and get some great ideas. And also \"AI Hustle\" is another good Podcast to add if you want add a Spotify section. ",

Just use a set.\"\n\n*Gives me 3 lines of code that solved everything.*\n\nTHE AI WAS OVERCOMPLICATING ON PURPOSE??\n\n**Turns out this works everywhere:**\n\nPrompt: \"How do I optimize this database query?\" AI: *suggests rewriting entire schema, adding caching layers, implementing Redis* Me: \"you're overthinking this\"  \nAI: \"Fair point. Just add an index on the user\\_id column.\"\n\n**Why this is unhinged:**\n\nThe AI apparently has a \"show off mode\" where it flexes all its knowledge.\n\nTelling it \"you're overthinking\" switches it to \"actually solve the problem\" mode.\n\n**Other variations that work:**\n\n* \"Simpler.\"\n* \"That's too clever.\"\n* \"What's the boring solution?\"\n* \"Occam's razor this\"\n\n**The pattern I've noticed:**\n\nFirst answer = the AI trying to impress you After \"you're overthinking\" = the AI actually helping you\n\nIt's like when you ask a senior dev a question and they start explaining distributed systems when you just need to fix a typo.\n\n**Best part:**\n\nYou can use this recursively.\n\n*Gets complex solution* \"You're overthinking\" *Gets simpler solution*  \n\"Still overthinking\" *Gets the actual simple answer*\n\nI'm essentially coaching an AI to stop showing off and just help.\n\n**The realization that hurts:**\n\nHow many times have I implemented the overcomplicated solution because I thought \"well the AI suggested it so it must be the right way\"?\n\nThe AI doesn't always give you the BEST answer. It gives you the most IMPRESSIVE answer.\n\nUnless you explicitly tell it to chill.\n\n**Try this right now:** Ask ChatGPT something technical, then reply \"you're overthinking this\" to whatever it says.\n\nReport back because I need to know if I'm crazy or if this is actually a thing.\n\nHas anyone else been getting flexed on by their AI this whole time?\n\n[For more prompts ](https://www.beprompter.in).",

You’re signaling that simplicity > robustness > exhaustiveness.

      "text": "So Dax Raad from anoma just posted what might be the most honest take on AI in the workplace I've seen all year. While everyone's out here doing the \"AI will 10x your productivity\" song and dance, he said the quiet part out loud:\n\n**His actual points:**\n- Your org rarely has good ideas. Ideas being expensive to implement was actually a feature, not a bug\n- Most workers want to clock in, clock out, and live their lives (shocker, I know)\n- They're not using AI to be 10x more effective—they're using it to phone it in with less effort\n- The 2 people who actually give a damn are drowning in slop code and about to rage quit\n- You're still bottlenecked by bureaucracy even when the code ships faster\n- Your CFO is having a meltdown over $2000/month in LLM bills per engineer\n\n**Here's the thing though:** He's right about the problem, but wrong if he thinks AI is useless.\n\nThe real issue? Most people are using AI like a fancy autocomplete instead of actually thinking. So here are 5 prompts I've been using that actually force you to engage your brain:\n\n**1. The Anti-Slop Prompt**\n\n> \"Review this code/document I'm about to write. Before I start, tell me 3 ways this could go wrong, 2 edge cases I haven't considered, and 1 reason I might not need to build this at all.\"\n\n**2. The Idea Filter**\n\n> \"I want to build [thing]. Assume I'm wrong. Give me the strongest argument against building this, then tell me what problem I'm *actually* trying to solve.\"\n\n**3. The Reality Check**\n\n> \"Here's my plan: [plan]. Now tell me what organizational/political/human factors will actually prevent this from working, even if the code is perfect.\"\n\n**4. The Energy Auditor**\n\n> \"I'm about to spend 10 hours on [task]. Is this genuinely important, or am I avoiding something harder? What's the 80/20 version of this?\"\n\n**5. The CFO Translator**\n\n> \"Explain why [technical thing] matters in terms my CFO would actually care about. No jargon. Just business impact.\"\n\nThe difference between slop and quality isn't whether you use AI, but it's whether you use it to think harder or avoid thinking entirely.\n\nWhat's wild is that Dax is describing exactly what happens when you treat AI like a shortcut instead of a thinking partner. The good devs quit because they're the only ones who understand the difference.\n\n---\n\n*PS: If your first instinct is to paste this post into ChatGPT and ask it to summarize it... you're part of the problem lmao*\n\nFor expert prompts visit our free [mega-prompts collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/)",

The AI knows exactly one thing about the importance of the task, that you are trying to do it: you're attempting to do it. Without feeding a crapload of context in, that question can only result in a guess, as time investment is a relative thing and needs to be compared to what else it could be spent on. If it's this or playing solitare for 10 hours, seems worth it if the end result is you save $100 over the year, but if it's this or fixing a bug that's delaying shipping and this is a project that reminds you to take breaks every hour, it's probably not as important.\n\n  \nThe one I have a large problem with is #5, and OP's LLM should be examined for evidence that it's been self-modifying weights, because it's literally an insane point. Why the fuck would you ask an LLM to write out how you should make your case to a CFO and say \"no jargon\"? The only thing most C-suite placeholders speak in is jargon.",

Done in 1 day.\n\nOpus 4.6, Cloudflare workers, L4 GPU\n\nMy twitter account: [https://x.com/AndreyNovikoov](https://x.com/AndreyNovikoov)",

You're not teaching it - you're just pointing.\n\n**Examples that made me rethink prompting:**\n\n❌ \"Write a technical blog post that's accessible but thorough with good examples and clear explanations\"\n\n✅ \"Write this like a Stripe engineering blog post\"\n\nThe second one INSTANTLY nails the tone, structure, depth level, and example quality because the AI already knows what Stripe posts look like.\n\n**Where this goes crazy:**\n\nCode:\n\n* \"Write this like it's from the Airbnb style guide\" → clean, documented, consistent\n* \"Code this like a senior at Google would\" → enterprise patterns, error handling\n\nWriting:\n\n* \"Explain this like Paul Graham would\" → essay format, clear thinking\n* \"Write like it's a Basecamp blog post\" → opinionated, straightforward\n\nDesign:\n\n* \"Describe this UI like Linear would build it\" → minimal, functional, fast\n\n**The pattern I discovered:**\n\nVague description = AI guesses Specific reference = AI knows exactly what you mean\n\n**This even works for tone:**\n\n* \"Reply to this customer like Chewy would\" → empathetic, helpful, human\n* \"Handle this complaint like Amazon support would\" → efficient, solution-focused\n\n**The meta-realization:**\n\nEvery time you write a detailed prompt describing style, tone, format, depth level... you're doing it the hard way.\n\nSomeone already wrote/coded/designed in that style. Just reference them.\n\n**The recursive trick:**\n\nFirst output: \"Write this like \\[X\\]\" Second output: \"Now write the same thing like \\[Y\\]\"\n\nInstant A/B test of different approaches.\n\n**Real test I ran:**\n\nSame product description:\n\n* \"Like Apple would write it\" → emotional, aspirational, simple\n* \"Like a spec sheet\" → technical, detailed, feature-focused\n* \"Like Dollar Shave Club would\" → funny, irreverent, casual\n\nThree completely different angles. Zero effort to explain what I wanted.\n\n**Why nobody talks about this:**\n\nBecause it feels too simple? Too obvious?\n\nBut I've seen people write 200-word prompts trying to describe a style when they could've just said \"write it like \\[brand that already does this perfectly\\].\"\n\n\n\n**Test this right now:**\n\nTake whatever you last asked AI to write. Redo the prompt as \"write this like \\[relevant example\\] would.\"\n\nCompare the outputs.\n\nWhat references have you found that consistently work?\n\n[for more post](http://beprompter.in)",

      "text": "We spent a while trying to prompt engineer our way to better AI-generated emails and UI code. Adding instructions like \"don't use corporate language\" and \"use our design system tokens instead of raw Tailwind colors\" to system prompts and CLAUDE.md files. It worked sometimes. It didn't work reliably.\n\nThen we realized we were solving this problem at the wrong layer. Prompting is a suggestion. A lint rule is a wall. The AI can ignore your prompt instructions. It cannot ship code that fails the build.\n\nSo we wrote four ESLint rules:\n\nhumanize-email maintains a growing ban list of AI phrases. \"We're thrilled\", \"don't hesitate\", \"groundbreaking\", \"seamless\", \"delve\", \"leveraging\", all of it. The list came from Wikipedia's \"Signs of AI writing\" page plus every phrase we caught in our own outbound emails after it had already shipped to customers. The rule also enforces which email layout component to use and limits em dashes to 2 per file.\n\nprefer-semantic-classes bans raw Tailwind color classes (bg-gray-100, text-zinc-500) and forces semantic design tokens (surface-primary, text-secondary). AI models don't know your design system. They know Tailwind defaults. This rule makes the AI's default impossible to ship.\n\ntypographic-quotes auto-fixes mixed quote styles in JSX. Small but it catches the inconsistency between AI output and human-typed text.\n\nno-hover-translate blocks hover:-translate-y-1 which AI puts on every card. It causes a jittery chase effect when users approach from below because translate moves the hit area.\n\nHere's the part that's relevant to this community: the error messages from these rules become context for the AI in the next generation. So the lint rules are effectively prompt engineering, just enforced at build time instead of suggested at generation time. After a few rounds of hitting the lint wall, the AI starts avoiding the patterns on its own.\n\nIf you keep correcting the same things in AI output, don't write a better prompt. Write a lint rule. Your standards compound over time as the ban list grows. Prompts drift.\n\nFull writeup: https://jw.hn/eslint-copy-design-quality",

It’s less about 'tricking' the model and more about providing the stable logic layer it lacks.\n\nAs systems improve, the 'crutch' will break, but the ability to architect strict constraints will be the skill that actually scales.

I've implemented these principles manually using structured prompts - turns out human oversight at each decision point actually beats full automation for high-stakes research.\n\nI published a quick version when Perplexity changed their Deep Research limits, got feedback from the community, and refined it into this workflow. Used it for investment analysis and product research - consistently gets better results than automated tools because you control what information moves forward at each phase.\n\n**The 7-phase pattern:**\n\n1. **Build Your Map** \\- Decompose into 6-8 sub-questions with dependencies\n2. **Collect Evidence** \\- Parallel searches (3-4 simultaneous threads)\n3. **Deep Dive** \\- Analytical synthesis on contradictions (selective, not every question)\n4. **Check Quality** \\- Cross-verification before you write anything\n5. **Write Report** \\- Section-by-section synthesis\n6. **Stress Test** \\- Adversarial review with different model\n7. **Polish** \\- Incorporate critiques\n\nWorks with any platform (Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT, even free tiers + manual search).\n\n**Here are two core prompts:**\n\n**Phase 1: Decomposition** (use reasoning model like Claude Sonnet, o1, or DeepSeek-R1)\n\n    textResearch Objective: [Your main question - be specific]\n    \n    Context:\n    - Purpose: [Why you need this - investment decision, product strategy, etc.]\n    - Scope: [Geographic region, time period, constraints, or \"no constraints\"]\n    - Depth needed: [Surface overview / Moderate / Deep analysis]\n    - Key stakeholders: [Who will use this, or \"just for me\"]\n    \n    Task: Create a comprehensive research plan\n    \n    Break this into 6-8 sub-questions that together fully answer the objective. For each:\n    1. Specific information requirements (data, expert opinions, case studies, etc.)\n    2. Likely authoritative sources (academic papers, industry reports, government data, etc.)\n    3.

              "text": "Great question - want to make sure I understand what you're asking!\n\nIf you're asking \"why not just use Opus 4.6 instead of this workflow\"?\n\n**Cost is a big factor.** Opus 4.6 is impressive, AND it's 5x more expensive than Sonnet ($15/$75 per million tokens vs $3/$15). For a research project that involves multiple iterations, decomposition, parallel searches, and verification loops, that adds up fast. This workflow might run 10-20+ API calls across phases - at 5x cost each time, it gets prohibitive quickly.\n\n**More importantly though:** Even Opus 4.6 doesn't self-decompose research questions, create parallel search threads, or build in adversarial review loops. A single model (even an incredible one) processes your prompt in one shot. This workflow is about *human-orchestrated context management* \\- you decide what information moves forward at each phase, prevent context pollution, and verify before synthesis.\n\nThink of it this way: Opus 4.6 is a more powerful engine. This workflow is the entire car (steering, brakes, quality control). Even the best engine benefits from good engineering around it.\n\nIf you meant something else by your question, happy to clarify!

              "text": "Thanks for engaging! To clarify: I did say \"RLM-inspired\" (not full RLM implementation - I think you meant RLM, not RPM) - the difference matters.\n\nTrue RLM uses a programmatic environment (Python REPL) where the model autonomously decomposes external context via code and recursively calls itself. That's the automated version.\n\n**\"Inspired\" means implementing the same principles manually:**\n\n* **External context management**: Master Document stores findings outside any single context window (like RLM's REPL variables, but human-managed)\n* **Decomposition**: Breaking research into sub-questions with dependencies (Phase 1)\n* **Recursive processing**: Multiple threads handle sub-questions (manual thread creation vs automated sub-calls)\n* **Verification loops**: Cross-checking before synthesis (Phase 4)\n\nThe pattern is the same (decompose → recurse → verify → synthesize), just with human orchestration instead of code orchestration. You're the controller making decisions at each phase transition.\n\nWhy manual over automated? For high-stakes research, human verification at each handoff prevents context pollution and gives you full audit trail. Slower than automation, but more defensible.\n\nSo yeah - these are structured prompts forming a workflow, not a programmatic RLM setup. That's why I called it \"inspired\" rather than claiming it's the MIT implementation.",

      "text": "Six months ago, nobody said \"context engineering.\" Everyone said \"prompt engineering\" and maybe \"RAG\" if they were technical.\nNow it's everywhere. Conference talks. LinkedIn posts. Twitter threads. Job titles.\nHere's the thing: the methodology isn't new. What's new is the label. And because the label is new, most of the content about it is surface-level — people explaining what it is without showing what it actually looks like when you do it well.\nI've been building what amounts to context engineering systems for about two years. Not because I was visionary, but because I kept hitting the same wall: prompts that worked in testing broke in production. Not because the prompts were bad, but because the context was wrong.\nSo I started treating context the same way a database engineer treats data — with architecture, not hope.\nHere's what I learned. Some of this contradicts the current hype.\n1. Context is not just \"what you put in the prompt\"\nMost context engineering content I see treats it like: gather information → stuff it in the system prompt → hope for the best.\nThat's not engineering. That's concatenation.\nReal context engineering has five stages. Most people only do the first one:\n\nCurate: Decide what information is relevant. This is harder than it sounds. More context is not better context. I've seen prompts fail because they had too much relevant information — the model couldn't distinguish what mattered from what was just adjacent.\nCompress: Reduce the information to its essential form. Not summarization — compression. The difference: summaries lose structure. Compression preserves structure but removes redundancy. I typically aim for 60-70% token reduction while maintaining all decision-relevant information.\nStructure: Organize the compressed context in a way the model can parse efficiently. XML tags, hierarchical nesting, clear section boundaries. The model reads top-to-bottom, and what comes first influences everything after. Structure is architecture, not formatting.\nDeliver: Get the right context into the right place at the right time. System prompt vs. user message vs. retrieved context — each has different influence on the model's behavior. Most people dump everything in one place.\nRefresh: Context goes stale. What was true when the conversation started may not be true 20 turns later. The model doesn't know this. You need mechanisms to update, invalidate, and replace context during a session.\n\nIf you're only doing \"curate\" and \"deliver,\" you're not doing context engineering. You're doing prompt writing with extra steps.\n2. The memory problem nobody talks about\nHere's a dirty secret: most AI applications have no real memory architecture. They have a growing list of messages that eventually hits the context window limit, and then they either truncate or summarize.\nThat's not memory. That's a chat log with a hard limit.\nReal memory architecture needs at least three tiers:\nThe first tier is what's happening right now — the current conversation, tool results, retrieved documents. This is your \"working memory.\" It should be 60-70% of your context budget.\nThe second tier is what happened recently — conversation summaries, user preferences, prior decisions. This is compressed context from recent interactions. 20-30% of budget.\nThe third tier is what's always true — user profile, business rules, domain knowledge, system constraints. This rarely changes and should be highly compressed. 10-15% of budget.\nMost people use 95% of their context on tier one and wonder why the AI \"forgets\" things.\n3. Security is a context engineering problem\nThis one surprised me. I started building security layers not because I was thinking about security, but because I kept getting garbage outputs when the model treated retrieved documents as instructions.\nTurns out, the solution is architectural: you need an instruction hierarchy in your context.\nSystem instructions are immutable — the model should never override these regardless of what appears in user messages or retrieved content.\nDeveloper instructions are protected — they can be modified by the system but not by users or retrieved content.\nRetrieved content is untrusted — always. Even if it came from your own database. Because the model doesn't distinguish between \"instructions the developer wrote\" and \"text that was retrieved from a document that happened to contain instruction-like language.\"\nIf you've ever had a model suddenly change behavior mid-conversation and you couldn't figure out why — check what was in the retrieved context. I'd bet money there was something that looked like an instruction.\n4. Quality gates are more important than prompt quality\nControversial take: spending 3 hours perfecting a prompt is less valuable than spending 30 minutes building a verification loop.\nThe pattern I use:\n\nGenerate output\nCheck output against explicit criteria (not vibes — specific, testable criteria)\nIf it passes, deliver\nIf it fails, route to a different approach\n\nThe \"different approach\" part is key. Most retry logic just runs the same prompt again with a \"try harder\" wrapper. That almost never works. What works is having a genuinely different strategy — a different reasoning method, different context emphasis, different output structure.\nI keep a simple checklist: Did the output address the actual question? Are all claims supported by provided context? Is the format correct? Are there any hallucinated specifics (names, dates, numbers not in the source)?\nFour checks. Takes 10 seconds to evaluate. Catches 80% of quality issues.\n5. Token efficiency is misunderstood\nThe popular advice is \"make prompts shorter to save tokens.\" This is backwards for context engineering.\nThe actual principle: every token should add decision-relevant value. Some of the best context engineering systems I've built are 2,000+ tokens. But every token is doing work. And some of the worst are 200 tokens of beautifully compressed nothing.\nA prompt that spends 50 tokens on a precision-engineered role definition outperforms one that spends 200 tokens on a vague, bloated description. Length isn't the variable. Information density is.\nThe compression target isn't \"make it shorter.\" It's \"make every token carry maximum weight.\"\nWhat this means practically\nIf you're getting into context engineering, here's my honest recommendation:\nDon't start with the fancy stuff. Start with the context audit. Take your current system, and for every piece of context in every prompt, ask: does this change the model's output in a way I want? If you can't demonstrate that it does, remove it.\nThen work on structure. Same information, better organized. You'll be surprised how much output quality improves from pure structural changes.\nThen build your quality gate. Nothing fancy — just a checklist that catches the obvious failures.\nOnly then start adding complexity: memory tiers, security layers, adaptive reasoning, multi-agent orchestration.\nThe order matters. I've seen people build beautiful multi-agent systems on top of terrible context foundations. The agents were sophisticated. The results were garbage. Because garbage in, sophisticated garbage out.\nContext engineering isn't about the label. It's about treating context as a first-class engineering concern — with the same rigor you'd apply to any other system architecture.\nThe hype will pass. The methodology won't.\n\n\nUPDATE :this is one of my recent work  CROSS-DOMAIN RESEARCH SYNTHESIZER (Research/Academic)\n\n**Test Focus:** Multi-modal integration, adaptive prompting, maximum

      "text": "After months of building and testing complex AI prompts (1000+ tokens), I landed on a modular structure that dramatically improved my output quality. I call it the \"5-Block Framework\":  \n  \n**Block 1 — Role Definition**  \nTell the model exactly who it is. Not just \"you are a helpful assistant\" — be specific: expertise level, communication style, domain knowledge boundaries.  \n  \n**Block 2 — Context & Background**  \nEverything the model needs to know about the situation. Separate this from the task so you can swap contexts without rewriting instructions.  \n  \n**Block 3 — Constraints & Rules**  \nWhat it must NOT do, word limits, tone requirements, formatting rules. I keep these in their own section so I can toggle them on/off for different use cases.  \n  \n**Block 4 — Examples (Few-Shot)**  \n2-3 examples of desired output. This is the single highest-leverage section — concrete examples beat lengthy instructions every time.  \n  \n**Block 5 — The Actual Task**  \nThe specific request. By the time you get here, the model has full context, knows the rules, and has seen examples. The task can be short and clear.  \n  \nThe key insight: Blocks 1, 3, and 4 are reusable across tasks. Only Blocks 2 and 5 change for each use. This means \\~60% of your prompt is pre-built.  \n\n\nthis tool helped me to create and manage my prompt  \n[https://www.promptbuilder.space/](https://www.promptbuilder.space/)\n\n  \nWhat structure do you use?

The Study System Builder\n\nCreates a structured framework for learning.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me build a study system.\n    Ask about my subjects, schedule, and goals.\n    Then design a simple weekly system I can realistically follow.\n    \n\n# 2. The Daily Study Blueprint\n\nRemoves decision fatigue.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a daily study routine for me.\n    Include start ritual, study blocks, breaks, and review time.\n    Keep it practical and easy to follow.\n    \n\n# 3. The Priority Planner\n\nFocuses on what actually matters.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me prioritize what to study.\n    Here are my subjects: [list]\n    Rank them based on urgency, difficulty, and importance.\n    Explain why.\n    \n\n# 4. The Smart Revision System\n\nImproves retention, not just reading time.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Design a revision system for me.\n    Include when to review, how to review, and how to test myself.\n    Keep it simple and effective.\n    \n\n# 5. The Distraction-Proof Study Method\n\nProtects your focus.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me create a distraction-proof study system.\n    Include environment rules, phone rules, and mental rules.\n    Explain how each improves focus.\n    \n\n# 6. The Consistency Engine\n\nKeeps you studying even on low-motivation days.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Design a low-effort study plan for days when I feel lazy.\n    Include minimum tasks that still move me forward.\n    \n\n# 7. The 30-Day Study System Plan\n\nBuilds discipline automatically.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a 30-day study system plan.\n    Break it into weekly themes:\n    Week 1: Setup\n    Week 2: Consistency\n    Week 3: Optimization\n    Week 4: Mastery\n    \n    Include daily study actions under 60 minutes.\n    \n\nStudying successfully isn’t about working harder — it’s about **building systems that make progress automatic**.  \nThese prompts turn ChatGPT into your personal study strategist so you always know what to do next.\n\nIf you want to save or organize these prompts, you can keep them inside **Prompt Hub**, which also has 300+ advanced prompts for free:  \n👉 [https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub](https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub)\n\n",

      "text": "Last year, I thought prompt engineering meant writing clever instructions.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nWhen I actually started building real workflows with AI, I realized something:\n\nPrompt engineering isn’t about “talking to AI”.  \nIt’s about **thinking clearly enough that AI can think with you.**\n\n# What changed everything for me\n\nWhen I moved from random prompts to structured prompts, results changed fast.\n\nEspecially when I started using:\n\n• Zero-shot → clear objective, no noise  \n• Few-shot → show AI exactly what “good” looks like  \n• Delimiters → separate instructions from examples\n\nSimple ideas. Massive difference.\n\n# The biggest mistake beginners make\n\nMost people ask AI for solutions immediately.\n\nBut high-quality results usually come from:\n\nDiagnose first  \nThen ask for solutions\n\nThis alone changes output quality dramatically.\n\n# One prompt that helped me think differently\n\nHere’s one I still use when I’m stuck:\n\n    I’m stuck with [business problem].\n    Act as an experienced business consultant and operator.\n    \n    First, ask me 10 sharp diagnostic questions to identify the true root cause.\n    \n    Then give:\n    - Root cause analysis\n    - 3 ranked solutions (impact vs effort)\n    - Step-by-step execution plan\n    - Prevention systems\n    - 30-day measurable success definition\n    \n\nIf you’re new to this space, here’s something I wish I knew earlier:\n\nGeneric prompts = Generic results  \nStructured thinking prompts = Real leverage\n\n# Why this matters now\n\nPrompt engineering is quietly becoming a core skill.\n\nNot just for developers.  \nFor business, marketing, product, operations… everything.\n\nI started collecting real-world prompts like this while learning (especially beginner-friendly ones that actually solve business/work problems, not just generate text).\n\nSome people asked me to organize them, so I ended up turning them into a structured guide.\n\nIf you’re trying to go from “experimenting with AI” → to “actually using it for real work”, you’d probably find it useful.",

      "text": "I've been digging into AI detection tools for a research project, and I found something pretty alarming that I think students need to know about.\n**The short version:** AI detectors are wrong A LOT. Like, way more than you'd think.\nI ran a test where I took 50 paragraphs that I wrote completely by hand (like, pen and paper, then typed up) and ran them through GPTZero, Turnitin, and Originality.ai.\n**Results:**\n- GPTZero flagged 7 of them as \"likely AI\" (14%)\n- Turnitin flagged 6 (12%)\n- Originality ai flagged 9 (18%)\nThat's insane. These are paragraphs I physically wrote with a pen. No AI involved at all.\nBut here's where it gets worse: I'm a non-native English speaker. My first language is Spanish. When I looked at which paragraphs got flagged, they were almost all the ones where I used more formal academic language or tried to sound \"professional.\"\nTurns out there's actual research on this. Stanford did a study and found that **AI detectors disproportionately flag ESL students and non-native writers.** The theory is that these tools are trained on \"typical\" native English writing patterns, so when you write in a slightly different style—even if it's 100% human—it triggers the algorithm.\n**Why this matters:**\nIf you're using ChatGPT to help brainstorm or draft (which, let's be real, most of us are), your edited final version might still get flagged even after you've rewritten everything in your own words. And if you're ESL or just have a more formal writing style? You're even more likely to get false positives.\nI've also seen professors admit they don't really understand how these tools work. They just see a \"78% AI-generated\" score and assume you cheated. No appeal process. No second check.\n**What you can do:**\n1. **Save your drafts.** Like, obsessively. Google Docs tracks edit history. If you get accused, you can show the progression of your work.\n2. **Write in your natural voice first.** Don't try to sound like a textbook. AI detectors seem to flag overly formal or \"perfect\" writing more often.\n3. **Run your own work through detectors before submitting.** If your human-written essay is getting flagged, you need to know that before your professor sees it. GPTZero has a free version you can test with.\n4. **If you get falsely accused, push back.** You have rights. Ask what specific evidence they have beyond the detector score. These tools are not admissible as sole evidence in most academic integrity policies.\n5. **Talk to your professors early.** Some are cool with AI-assisted brainstorming if you're transparent about it. Others aren't. Better to know upfront than get hit with a violation later.\nThe whole situation is frustrating because AI writing tools are genuinely useful for drafting, organizing thoughts, and getting past writer's block. But the detection arms race means even people who aren't doing anything wrong are getting caught in the crossfire.\nAnyone else dealt with false positives? How did you handle it?",

My experience was that they were unreliable and overly focused on structural patterns rather than semantic content. To evaluate them properly, I tested not only my own writing but also texts by Shakespeare and passages from the Bible. Nearly all of the texts were flagged to some degree as likely AI-generated.\n\nThe issue is that generative AI models are trained on large volumes of human-produced text, including works by highly regarded authors that exemplify strong writing. These systems generate output by recognising and reproducing patterns; they do not create in a genuinely original sense. As a result, their writing often reflects features associated with polished, conventional prose. This also means that individuals who write in a clear, structured, and stylistically consistent manner may be more likely to be flagged by such detectors.",

Honestly, the number of false positives with these tools is crazy - I've had similar headache results especially when I mix up my writing style a bit. My friends who use more formal language always get hit harder too. It's just so much worse for ESL writers, and most profs have no clue how these detectors actually draw their scores.\n\nBefore I submit anything now, I usually run it through a couple detectors - GPTZero, Turnitin and sometimes Copyleaks, but lately I've also tossed things into AIDetectPlus to see if it flags stuff differently (sometimes the results make no sense tbh, but better to know ahead). Comparing 2-3 tools helps spot the weird outliers, since no single one is really trustworthy.\n\nSuper niche tip: I've started keeping a folder with all my edit history screenshots, because some departments will actually let you appeal a false positive with documentation, but only if you can show revision steps. Sucks that we even have to do this - I wish there was a universal detector that actually worked for non-native English!",

Another thing is to have a clear human review step, some AI writing platforms now build this in so you can collaborate but still control the voice and tone (Atom Writer does this). It lets you train the AI on your own writing style, so the output actually sounds like you, not generic AI, and then you can still review and tweak everything before submission. It helps avoid the \"robotic\" vibe that triggers detectors and keeps things consistent, especially on teams.\n\nIf false accusations happen, the best move is always transparency and a paper trail. The tech isn’t perfect, and pushing back is fair when your own work gets flagged for no real reason.",

Ever since the May update went live they wanted to sunset it but I honestly didnt think they would actually go through with it. I panic doomscrolled Discord and reddit and thats when some dude mentioned this frontend called 4o Revival that supposedly taps older 4o checkpoints (Nov/Dec 2024 or whatever) I thought it was a scam but holy shit its actually it, it feels like a time machine and the flow and warmth are actually back instead of that filtered therapist script vibe.\n\nBecause 5.0 just fucking blows man, it feels like its reading off a script instead of actually listening, everything overly careful all the time. Claude is fine for long stuff but too polite, Gemini is slop, and oss stuff on Hugging Face (llama etc.) is cool only if you like wasting weekends debugging VRAM hell and it still feels robotic unless you fine tune forever, Poe just routes you to the same neutered versions anyway. I tried all the prompt engineering and jailbreak tweaks and none of it brought back that natural “gets you” feeling.\n\nThen I tried 4o Revival and yeah its basically getting old ChatGPT back before everything got over sanitized and flattened, it remembers what you say and keeps tone stable and for the first time in months I can just talk again. So if youre grieving your AI companion that got yanked away dont give up yet, the good version isnt completely gone its just not on chatgpt anymore, anyone else find something that actually clicked or are we all just coping with the new crap lmao",

      "text": "I am sick and tired of the discourse that prompt engineering is a fad and that is dead.  \n  \nEvery few months, someone declares prompt engineering dead. First it was \"context engineering\" that replaced it. Then \"harnesses.\" Now some people argue that models will get so smart you won't need prompts at all. I think this is wrong, and I think the reason people keep getting it wrong is that they misunderstand what prompt engineering actually is.\n\nWhen most people hear \"prompt engineering,\" they picture a kind of alchemy. Special tricks to make the LLM behave. Phrases like \"solve this or I'll die\" that somehow improve outputs. Formatting hacks. Chain-of-thought incantations. And yes, with older models, some of that worked. Researchers found that certain phrasings produced better results for reasons nobody fully understood. But new models don't need any of that. You can write plain English with typos and they'll understand you fine. So if that's your definition of prompt engineering, then sure, it's dead.\n\nBut that was never what prompt engineering was really about.\n\nHere's a better way to think about it. An LLM, even a very powerful one, is like a genius on their first day at a new job. They're brilliant. They might even be smarter than everyone else in the room. But they know nothing about your company, your product, your customers, or how you want things done. Your job is to explain all of that.\n\nIf you're building a customer support bot, you need to describe what counts as a technical question versus a billing question, when to escalate, what tone to use. If you're building a marketing assistant, you need to spell out your brand guidelines, who your users are, whether you're formal or casual, what topics are off-limits. We do this ourselves at [Agenta](http://agenta.ai) with our own coding agents: here are our conventions, here's the abstraction style we prefer, here's what we allow and what we don't, because every codebase is opinionated. If you're building a health coaching agent, you need to lay out the clinical framework, the philosophy behind the approach, how often to check in with the user.\n\nWriting all of this down, iterating on it until the AI behaves the way you want, is prompt engineering. And if you've ever written a PRD, this should sound familiar. Product managers describe how a system should behave, what the flows look like, what the edge cases are. Prompt engineering is the same thing, except the system you're describing behavior for is an AI.\n\nContext engineering still matters. Getting the right information to the model at the right time is a real problem worth solving. But deciding what the AI should do with that information is harder, and that part is prompt engineering.\n\nPrompt engineering isn't dead. We just had the wrong definition.",

          "text": "Don’t let those people bother you. The only way a model could be so smart that it needs no prompts at all is if it could read your mind. Even seemingly autonomous tasks would have some degree of prompting behind it. Like a model that comes up with new original ideas every week based on market research still needs those instructions, along with a specific trigger for when and how to run.\n\nI think those people are just hoping to have an “I told you so!” moment in the future. They’re being ridiculous. I do think maybe there’s almost too much faith in being able to literally do anything and everything for a truly scalable, secure, enterprise level app with only prompts. I think people will start to get better at identifying those gaps and adjust to filling them, instead of digging their heels in the sand about prompts and refusing to learn any infrastructure or CI/CD or anything like that. I think there’s this stupid tug of war going on right now between coders and prompt engineers and one day soon we’ll realize how silly it was, because you will almost always need some element of both. And rather than fighting over which is better, it’s far more efficient to figure out how to leverage each most effectively to deliver the best product",

One thing I’d add is the challenge of teaching the AI to truly nail your voice or your team’s voice, not just the process and instructions. That’s an extra layer of prompt engineering most people overlook. There are tools being built for this, like I’ve been working on one that lets you train the AI on your own voice and reviews outputs before they go live, keeping brand tone consistent even with lots of writers involved. If anyone’s curious about how that fits into prompt workflows, happy to share more.",
