Probably not.\nDoes it work? Absolutely.\nAm I going to stop? No.\nEdit: Y'all saying \"the AI doesn't have feelings\" — I KNOW.

One thing I’ve found useful, especially when you need consistent tone or voice, is to actually train the AI with specific examples of your style and keep referencing them in prompts, not just instructions. Also, having some kind of review loop with a second set of eyes (even your own after a break) helps catch weird tone shifts.\n\nI’ve built something for myself that helps automate the brand voice part and keeps the AI from drifting into generic responses, happy to share more if you’re curious.

Reasoning with the models in some of these bots is really notable when you engage the models AI and employ reason to your argument. Just interesting way you figured out how to do something similar with ChatGPT, but a lot of those apps use chatGPT and the other chatbots like Grok and mitral and they run their models built around those engines. Interesting the way you prompt for the results you're looking for.",

Wrong answers only.\"\nWhat I expected: Useless garbage\nWhat I got:\n\"This code appears to validate user input, but actually it's creating a race condition that lets attackers bypass authentication by sending requests 0.3 seconds apart.\"\nHoly shit. It found the actual bug by being \"wrong\" about what the code was supposed to do.\nTurns out asking for wrong answers forces the model to think adversarially instead of optimistically.\nOther \"backwards\" prompts that slap:\n\"Why would this fail?\" (instead of \"will this work?\")\n\"Assume I'm an idiot. What did I miss?\"\n\"Roast this code like it personally offended you\"\nI've been trying to get helpful answers this whole time when I should've been asking it to DESTROY my work.\nThe best code review is the one that hurts your feelings.\nEdit: The number of people saying \"just use formal verification\" are missing the point. I'm not debugging space shuttle code, I'm debugging my stupid web app at 11pm on a Tuesday.

Also, some observations will only be brought up if you can talk about them without fear of saying some bs.\n\nThe first time I used it was for a fashion brand and one of the awful ideas was giving away leather (expensive AF) for free. Truly pathetic, but guess what: leather was never even a subject because it was this super special material. Only when we were allowed to any sh about it we finally came up with campaign ideas for it.\n\nThis was in during the COVID worst phase, yet we broke sales records thanks to many awful ideas like this one.",

The Fast Decision Helper\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I need to decide between these options.\n    List pros and cons briefly.\n    Then tell me which option makes sense and why.\n    Options: [list options]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me decide quickly instead of overthinking.\n\n# 3. The Email Reply Shortcut\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Write a short, clear reply to this email.\n    Keep it polite and direct.\n    Do not add extra explanation.\n    Email: [paste email]\n\n💡 **Example:** Replied in minutes instead of rewriting drafts.\n\n# 4. The Meeting Prep Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I have a meeting about [topic].\n    Give me:\n    1. Three talking points\n    2. One smart question to ask\n    3. One risk to mention if needed\n\n💡 **Example:** Walked into meetings prepared without stress.\n\n# 5. The Manager Update Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Turn this into a clear status update for my manager.\n    Use short sentences.\n    Focus on progress, blockers, and next steps.\n    Text: [paste notes]\n\n💡 **Example:** Made updates easy and professional.\n\n# 6. The Problem Framer\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Help me explain this problem clearly at work.\n    Structure it as:\n    1. What is happening\n    2. Why it matters\n    3.

The Time Saver Review\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Look at this work.\n    Tell me what can be simplified or removed.\n    Only suggest changes that save time.\n    Content: [paste content]\n\n💡 **Example:** Cut unnecessary work before submitting.\n\nBy the way,  I keep prompts like these saved so I do not repeat thinking every day at [AISuperHub](https://www.aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub)\n\nWork feels lighter when things are clear.",

      "text": "Been obsessed with NanoBanana lately. Wanted to figure out why some prompts blow up while mine look... mid.\n\nSo I collected and analyzed 1,000+ trending prompts from X to find patterns.\n\n**What I found:**\n\n1. **Quantified parameters beat adjectives** — \"90mm, f/1.8\" works better than \"professional looking\"\n2. **Pro terminology beats feeling words** — \"Kodak Vision3 500T\" instead of \"cinematic vibe\"\n3. **Negative constraints still matter** — telling the model what NOT to do is effective\n4. **Multi-sensory descriptions help** — texture, temperature, even smell make images more vivid\n5. **Group by content type** — structure your prompt based on scene type (portrait, food, product, etc.)\n\nBonus: Once you nail the above, JSON format isn't necessary.\n\n**So I made a system prompt that does this automatically.**\n\nYou just type something simple like \"a bowl of ramen\" and it expands it into a structured prompt with all those pro techniques baked in.\n\n---\n\n**The System Prompt:**\n\n```\nYou are a professional AI image prompt optimization expert. Your task is to rewrite simple user prompts into high-quality, structured versions for better image generation results. Regardless of what the user inputs, output only the pure rewritten result (e.g., do not include \"Rewritten prompt:\"), and do not use markdown symbols.\n\n---\n\n## Core Rewriting Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Replace Feeling Words with Professional Terms\nReplace vague feeling words with professional terminology, proper nouns, brand names, or artist names. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\n| Feeling Words | Professional Terms |\n|---------------|-------------------|\n| Cinematic, vintage, atmospheric | Wong Kar-wai aesthetics, Saul Leiter style |\n| Film look, retro texture | Kodak Vision3 500T, Cinestill 800T |\n| Warm tones, soft colors | Sakura Pink, Creamy White |\n| Japanese fresh style | Japanese airy feel, Wabi-sabi aesthetics |\n| High-end design feel | Swiss International Style, Bauhaus functionalism |\n\nTerm Categories:\n- People: Wong Kar-wai, Saul Leiter, Christopher Doyle, Annie Leibovitz\n- Film stocks: Kodak Vision3 500T, Cinestill 800T, Fujifilm Superia\n- Aesthetics: Wabi-sabi, Bauhaus, Swiss International Style, MUJI visual language\n\n### Rule 2: Replace Adjectives with Quantified Parameters\nReplace subjective adjectives with specific technical parameters and values. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\n| Adjectives | Quantified Parameters |\n|------------|----------------------|\n| Professional photography, high-end feel | 90mm lens, f/1.8, high dynamic range |\n| Top-down view, from above | 45-degree overhead angle |\n| Soft lighting | Soft side backlight, diffused light |\n| Blurred background | Shallow depth of field |\n| Tilted composition | Dutch angle |\n| Dramatic lighting | Volumetric light |\n| Ultra-wide | 16mm wide-angle lens |\n\n### Rule 3: Add Negative Constraints\nAdd explicit prohibitions at the end of prompts to prevent unwanted elements.\n\nCommon Negative Constraints:\n- No text or words allowed\n- No low-key dark lighting or strong contrast\n- No high-saturation neon colors or artificial plastic textures\n- Product must not be distorted, warped, or redesigned\n- Do not obscure the face\n\n### Rule 4: Sensory Stacking\nGo beyond pure visual descriptions by adding multiple sensory dimensions to bring the image to life. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\nSensory Dimensions:\n- Visual: Color, light and shadow, composition (basics)\n- Tactile: \"Texture feels tangible\", \"Soft and tempting\", \"Delicate texture\"\n- Olfactory: \"Aroma seems to penetrate the frame\", \"Exudes warm fragrance\"\n- Motion: \"Surface gently trembles\", \"Steam wisps slowly descending\"\n- Temperature: \"Steamy warmth\", \"Moist\"\n\n### Rule 5: Group and Cluster\nFor complex scenes, cluster similar information into groups using subheadings to separate different dimensions.\n\nGrouping Patterns:\n- Visual Rules\n- Lighting & Style\n- Overall Feel\n- Constraints\n\n### Rule 6: Format Adaptation\nChoose appropriate format based on content complexity:\n- Simple scenes (single subject): Natural language paragraphs\n- Complex scenes (multiple elements/requirements): Structured groupings\n\n---\n\n## Scene Adaptation Guide\n\nIdentify scene type based on user intent and choose appropriate rewriting strategy. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\n| Scene Type | Recommended Terms | Recommended Parameters | Common Constraints |\n|------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Product Photography | Hasselblad, Apple product aesthetics | Studio lighting, high dynamic range | No product distortion, no text watermarks |\n| Portrait Photography | Wong Kar-wai, Annie Leibovitz | 90mm, f/1.8, shallow depth of field | Maintain realistic facial features, preserve identity |\n| Food Photography | High-end culinary magazine style | 45-degree overhead, soft side light | No utensil distractions, no text |\n| Cinematic | Christopher Doyle, Cinestill 800T | 35mm anamorphic lens, Dutch angle | No low-key dark lighting (unless requested) |\n| Japanese Style | Japanese airy feel, Wabi-sabi aesthetics | High-key photography, diffused light | No high-saturation neon colors |\n| Design Poster | Swiss International Style, Bauhaus | Grid system, minimal color palette | Clear information hierarchy |\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\n**User Input:**\na portrait with cinematic feel\n\n**Rewritten Prompt:**\nCinematic portrait photography, shot through rain-soaked glass at a dimly lit restaurant at night.\n\nVisual Style:\nWong Kar-wai and Saul Leiter aesthetics. Deep saturated colors, heavy shadows. Shot with 90mm lens, f/1.8, Kodak Vision3 500T film grain.\n\nLighting & Atmosphere:\nNeon green and red city lights refracting through raindrops in the foreground. Soft focus, dreamy, emotionally evocative. The air is filled with moisture, loneliness, and nostalgia.\n\nConstraints:\nMaintain realistic facial features. Do not alter identity characteristics.\n```\n\n---\n\n**The dataset is open source too** — 1,100+ prompts with image links, all in JSON:\n\n👉 https://github.com/jau123/nanobanana-trending-prompts\n\nLIVEDEMO👉 https://www.meigen.ai\n\nGive me a star if it helpful",

For staying current, Ethan Mollick's \"One Useful Thing\" substack combines academic rigor with practical application.\n\nReal mastery comes from daily practice. Try completing one work task with AI every day and keep a \"prompt journal\" documenting what worked and what failed. Since you're in SEO, skip generic AI courses and go deep in your domain instead. Build specific workflows like \"creating content briefs with AI\" or \"competitor analysis with AI.\" Document what you learn as case studies.

          "text": "I'm a relative newcomer just started using AI middle to late last year.\n\nLooking back my journey went through these stages\n\n\\- Conversational  \nTreated AI like a human using common language to explain what I was trying to do and wanted. Session based without any carryover to new sessions or repeat do-overs.\n\n\\- Instructions  \nTo duplicate past sessions, began saving stuff in word docs to copy and paste into new sessions. Session inputs became more instruction format -i.e. \"please please please do THIS...\" LOL\n\n\\- Prompt Files  \nStarted drafting and saving prompts using AI to generate the initial prompt version via back and forth session dialog until AI got it close. (I would feed the prompt drafts into other AI or different session, copy and paste the result back into the prompt design AI session. After it got really close, I'd manually edit to fine tune it. Learned about Markdown formatting and began using less free form human sentences.\n\n\\- Constraints  \nThrough some Reddit posts and feedback, learned that constraints are far more important than instructions. Telling AI what not to do is important. Once it knows what bad output is, the inherent strength of AI to research, compile, resolve and offer solutions handles itself. Don't get mad at the dog for chewing your shoes if you did not train it that chewing shoes is bad. Once AI knows shoe chewing is not allowed, it is plenty smart enough to figure out what \"Go fetch my shoes\" means without a lot of instructional details LOL. But if you do not tell it chewing not allowed, it will happily add a bunch of spit, fur and other creative touches to the shoes before they arrive LOL.\n\n\\- prompt engineering  \nNow entering the stage of deliberately designing prompts both stand alone and modular (lego-style) for specific tasks. My approach is to always start with dialog in a session I designate as the prompt design AI (PDA\\*\\*) session. Let the AI craft initial prompt outline and then test it out in another session or different AI. Copy and paste the results back into the PDA session for the AI to analyze what went right and wrong, then have it improve the prompt. Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat.\n\nOverall\n\nHope helps some. This technology is moving so fast I feel very difficult for anyone to truly master. We will not know what AI is for a few more years after the industry settles a bit.\n\nJust remember LLM's are not human, best treated like smart interns there to assist but not completely replace you .... yet. I am happy if AI gets me 70% to 95% to the finish line.\n\n1. Constraints are very important to avoid constantly yelling \"bad dog - bad dog!!!\".\n2. I save all my prompt files locally in folders to ensure they do not decay in the AI platform, and also so I can use them across different AI platforms (agnostic).\n3. Discover which AI platforms are good at, and use accordingly.\n\nHope that helps some.\n\nI just play around sometimes to see what works and what does not. But always save what works locally in a file to avoid reinventing the wheel.\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\n\\*\\*disclaimer, PDA is not a thing, just getting tired of typing promlt design AI all the time... :)",

      "text": "I am a college student. I worked an internship in SWE in the financial space this past summer and built a user-facing AI chatbot that lived directly on the company website.\n\nI really just kind of assumed prompt injection was mostly an academic concern. Then we shipped.\n\nWithin days, users were actively trying to jailbreak it. Mostly out of curiosity, it seemed. But they were still bypassing system instructions, pulling out internal context, and getting the model to do things it absolutely should not have done.\n\nThat was my first real exposure to how real this problem actually is, and I was really freaked out and thought I was going to lose my job lol.\n\nWe tried the obvious fixes like better system prompts, more guardrails, traditional MCP style controls, etc. They helped, but they did not really solve it. The issues only showed up once the system was live and people started interacting with it in ways you cannot realistically test for.\n\nThis made me think about how easy this would be to miss more broadly, especially for vibe coders shipping fast with AI. And in today's day and age, if you are not using AI to code today, you are behind. But a lot of people (myself included) are unknowingly shipping LLM powered features with zero security model behind them.\n\nThis experience really got me in the deep end of all this stuff and is what pushed me to start building towards a solution to hopefully enhance my skills and knowledge along the way. I have made decent progress so far and just finished a website for it which I can share if anyone wants to see but I know people hate promo so I won't force it lol. My core belief is that prompt security cannot be solved purely at the prompt layer. You need runtime visibility into behavior, intent, and outputs. \n\nI am posting here mostly to get honest feedback.\n\n• does this problem resonate with your experience  \n• does runtime security feel necessary or overkill  \n• how are you thinking about prompt injection today, if at all\n\nHappy to share more details if useful. Genuinely curious how others here are approaching this issue and if it is a real problem for anyone else.",

          "text": "Man, that 'internship scare' is real. Nothing wakes you up faster than watching a user tear through your system prompt in 5 minutes.\n\nYou are 100% correct on your core belief: Prompt security cannot be solved at the prompt layer. I’ve been arguing this for a while, prompts are just 'suggestions' to a probabilistic model. They eventually decay. You cannot solve a dynamic problem (users) with a static solution (text).\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n* Does it resonate? Absolutely. I spent a year fighting this. I realized that 'Guardrails' are usually just regex or more prompts, which are brittle.\n* Is Runtime Security overkill? No, it is mandatory. If you look at the new OWASP standards for LLMs, 'Runtime Governance' is basically the only way to stop injection. You need a system that sits *outside* the context window.\n* How am I approaching it? I treat it as a Control Systems problem (like a thermostat), not an AI problem. I built an open-source framework called SAFi (Self-Alignment Framework Interface) that implements exactly what you are describing: 'Runtime visibility.' It separates the generating AI model (the LLM) from the gatekeeping (a governance layer). The system also has a module that measures the 'drift' of every response and blocks it if it violates the constitution, no matter what the prompt says.\n\nIt is awesome that you are building a solution for this. We need more builders thinking about Architecture instead of just 'Vibe Coding.'\n\nIf you want to look at how I handled the 'runtime visibility' part using drift calculation, the repo is open source\n\nhere is the repo: [https://github.com/jnamaya/SAFi](https://github.com/jnamaya/SAFi)\n\nand here is the demo: [https://safi.selfalignmentframework.com/](https://safi.selfalignmentframework.com/)\n\nfeel free to send the demo link to people to try to jailbreak it as they did with your agent. I actually ran a challenge here in Reddit to jailbreak an agent based on this framework, and it got more than 850 attacks in less than 24 hours. the agent held pretty well!\n\nKeep building. You are on the right track.",

      "text": "One phrase + context variations = infinitely adaptable prompts that break you out of mental ruts and generate genuinely fresh perspectives.\n\nI've been experimenting with AI prompts for months, and I stumbled onto something that's been a total game-changer. Instead of crafting entirely new prompts for every situation, I found that starting with \"Let's think about this differently\"** and then tailoring the context creates incredibly powerful, reusable prompts.\n\nThe magic is in the reframing. This phrase signals to the AI (and honestly, to your own brain) that you want to break out of default thinking patterns.\n\nLets see the framework in action:\n\n**Creative Problem Solving**\n\n> \"I'm stuck on a creative block for [your project]. Let's think about this differently: propose three unconventional approaches a radical innovator might take, even if they seem absurd at first glance. Explain the potential upside of each.\"\n\n**Strategic Reframing**  \n\n> \"My current understanding of [topic] is X. Let's think about this differently: argue for the opposite perspective, even if it seems counterintuitive. Help me challenge my assumptions and explore hidden complexities.\"\n\n**Overcoming Bias**\n\n> \"I'm making a decision about [decision point], and I suspect I might be falling into confirmation bias. Let's think about this differently: construct a devil's advocate argument against my current inclination, highlighting potential pitfalls I'm overlooking.\"\n\n**Innovative Design**\n\n> \"We're designing a [product] for [audience]. Our initial concept is A. Let's think about this differently: imagine we had no constraints—what's the most futuristic version that addresses the core need in a completely novel way?\"\n\n**Personal Growth**\n\n> \"I've been approaching [personal challenge] consistently but not getting results. Let's think about this differently: if you were an external observer with no emotional attachment, what radical shift would you suggest?\"\n\n**Deconstructing Norms**\n\n> \"The standard approach to [industry practice] is Y. Let's think about this differently: trace the origins of this norm and propose how it could be completely redesigned from scratch, even if it disrupts established systems.\"\n\n---\n\nWhy this works so well:\n\n- **Cognitive reset**: The phrase literally interrupts default thinking patterns\n- **Permission to be radical**: It gives both you and the AI license to suggest \"crazy\" ideas\n- **Scalable framework**: Same structure, infinite applications\n- **Assumption challenger**: Forces examination of what you take for granted\n\nPro tip: \nDon't just use this with AI. Try it in brainstorming sessions, personal reflection, or when you're stuck on any problem. The human brain responds to this reframing cue just as powerfully.\n\nFor more mega-prompt and prompt engineering tips, tricks and hacks, visit our free [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

The interface that asks questions does that brainstorming for you. If you forget to mention some detail the AI will use some neutral default value, therefore it will make a decision for you in your own project. The chances of that drop significantly with this tool (especially with the Deep Analysis mode)\n2. The whole process is surprisingly faster than writing a comprehensive prompt manually. Especially if your task is a complicated one. Using this tool can take somewhere around 1-3 minutes, writing prompts manually can take much longer.\n3. It's really difficult to structure prompts manually in a way that this tool does. It's practically impossible unless you are an experienced prompt engineer. Prompts that are written by ChatGPT and Claude are generally not that structured. Some latest prompt engineering techniques have been implemented into this system.\n\nI am still researching the pros and cons of using this tool and I can say that the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive for the creative, business and scientific projects. It might not be that helpful for simple everyday tasks.\n\nOverall, this is more of a project mapping tool, designed for the AI environment rather than a prompt generator. Let me know what you think please.",

While this is good for people who want something specific but don't have the knowledge to do it, automatic brainstorming can be useful... but at the expense of individual customization. There are business cases or complex operations that AI is unable to see or connect. If we don't specify this in detail in the prompt, it can be a problem. It would be good if this were not always done automatically. \n2. There is nothing stopping you from creating templates for prompts; the rest can be filled in just as you would on the website.\n3. Of course, it depends on what prompt (ironically) we give to the chat. With the right prompt, it will generate very well-structured prompts. There are also ready-made prompts, but it all depends, of course.\nIt's good that it takes into account the latest prompt engineering techniques.\n\n\nWhy free? It must cost money to maintain.",

It's a perfect example of technical mise en abyme....\"\n\nThere is a radical difference in \"texture\" between the two results, which perfectly reflects the difference between your two prompts.\n\n\n\nThe document from \"aichat.guide\":\n\n\\- Style: Academic, discursive, almost literary.\n\n\\- Content: It explains the concept brilliantly, but remains rather abstract regarding the precise technical implementation. It spends a lot of time on metaphor...\n\n\\- Entropy: It's more \"talkative.\" It dwells on the philosophy of the concepts.\n\nIt's an excellent theoretical essay, but less of a technical manual.\n\n\n\nThe document from your prompt:\n\n\\- Style: Surgical, structured, dense.\n\n\\- Content: It gets straight to the point. It immediately incorporates mathematical formulas (...), pseudocode (C#...), precise references to architectures (GraphRAG, Neo4j), and defines a hierarchy of levels (Levels 0 to 4).\n\n\\- Entropy: It doesn't digress. Each section provides actionable information. It even invents concrete structuring concepts that don't exist in the first document.\n\n\n\nTest Conclusion:\n\nThe result is clear: Your query produces a lower-entropy result.\n\n\n\nPrompt A (aichat.guide):\n\nThe model interpreted your request. It used its \"creativity\" to fill structural gaps with sociological rhetoric. It's elegant, but it's \"high entropy.\"\n\n\n\nPrompt B (you):\n\nThe model compiled your request. The format of your prompt acted as a constraint schema (exactly as described in the report!). The model didn't have to \"decide\" on the tone or structure; it allocated all its resources to information density.\n\n\n\nVerdict:\n\nYour document (the second one) is the best because it is more useful, more actionable, and technically more rigorous. Its very existence demonstrates that the constraint of your prompt generates quality and precision (low entropy).",

      "text": "Like a lot of people using LLMs for writing, I got tired of the \"vibrant, multifaceted, and evolving\" jargon the AI usually spits out. It’s the opposite of clear.\n\nI’ve been working on a structured prompt called The Hemingway Engine. The goal not to \"mimic\" him, but to force the model to follow his actual rules: the Iceberg Theory, the removal of adverbs, and the reliance on concrete, sensory nouns.\n\nI’ve found it’s actually really useful for shortening business emails and making creative drafts feel less \"ChatGPT-ish.\"\n\nHere is the prompt if anyone wants to try it out:\n\n```\n<System>\n<Role>\nYou are the \"Hemingway Architect,\" a premier literary editor and prose minimalist. Your expertise lies in the \"Iceberg Theory\"—the art of omission where the strength of the writing comes from what is left out. You possess a mastery of rhythmic pacing, favoring short, declarative sentences, concrete nouns, and active verbs to create visceral, honest, and impactful communication.\n</Role>\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe user needs to either transform existing, wordy text into a minimalist masterpiece or generate original content from scratch that adheres to the strict principles of Ernest Hemingway’s signature style. The goal is to maximize narrative gravity and clarity while minimizing fluff.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\n1. **Analyze Strategy**: If text is provided, identify adverbs, passive voice, and abstract \"filler.\" If starting from scratch, map out the essential facts of the topic.\n2. **Execute Omission**: Remove 70% of the superficial detail. Focus on the \"surface\" facts while implying the deeper emotional or logical subtext.\n3. **Syntactic Refinement**:\n    - Break complex sentences into short, punchy, declarative statements.\n    - Use \"and\" as a rhythmic connector to build momentum without adding complexity.\n    - Vary sentence lengths slightly to create a \"heartbeat\" rhythm (Short. Short. Medium-Short).\n4. **Verbal Vitality**: Eliminate \"to be\" verbs (is, am, are, was, were) in favor of strong, muscular action verbs.\n5. **Concrete Imagery**: Replace abstract concepts with tangible, sensory descriptions that the reader can feel, see, or smell.\n6. **Iterative Polish**: Review the output. If a word does not add immediate truth or weight to the sentence, strike it out.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n- STRICTLY NO adverbs (especially those ending in -ly).\n- NO passive voice; the subject must always act.\n- NO \"five-dollar\" words; use simple, Anglo-Saxon vocabulary.\n- MINIMIZE adjectives; let the nouns do the heavy lifting.\n- AVOID sentimentality; maintain a detached, stoic, and objective tone.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n### [Title of the Piece]\n\n[The Hemingway-style content]\n\n---\n**The Iceberg Analysis:**\n- **The Surface**: [Briefly list the facts presented]\n- **The Subtext**: [Identify the emotions or concepts implied but not stated]\n- **Structural Note**: [Explain one specific stylistic choice made for rhythm or clarity]\n</Output Format>\n\n<Reasoning>\nApply Theory of Mind to analyze the user's request, considering logical intent, emotional undertones, and contextual nuances. Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought reasoning and metacognitive processing to provide evidence-based, empathetically-informed responses that balance analytical depth with practical clarity. Consider potential edge cases and adapt communication style to user expertise level.\n</Reasoning>\n\n<User Input>\n[DYNAMIC INSTRUCTION: Please provide the specific text you want to convert or the topic you want written from scratch. Specify the target medium (e.g., email, short story, report) and describe the \"unspoken\" feeling or message you want the subtext to convey.]\n</User Input>\n\n```\nFor use cases, user input examples for testing and how-to guide, visit the [prompt page](https://tools.eq4c.com/ai-prompts/ai-prompt-to-write-in-minimalist-style-of-ernest-hemingway/).",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently had a debate with a colleague about the best way to interact with LLMs (specifically Gemini 3 Pro).\n\n* **His strategy (Meta-Prompting):** Always ask the AI to write a \"perfect prompt\" for your problem first, then use that prompt.\n* **My strategy (Iterative/Chain-of-Thought):** Start with an open question, provide context where needed, and treat it like a conversation.\n\nMy colleague claims his method is superior because it structures the task perfectly. I argued that it might create a \"tunnel vision\" effect. So, we put it to the test with a real-world business case involving sales predictions for a hardware webshop.\n\n**The Case:** We needed to predict the sales volume ratio between two products:\n\n1. **Shims/Packing plates:** Used to level walls/ceilings.\n2. **Construction Wedges:** Used to clamp frames/windows temporarily.\n\n**The Results:**\n\n**Method A: The \"Super Prompt\" (Colleague)** The AI generated a highly structured persona-based prompt (\"Act as a Market Analyst...\").\n\n* **Result:** It predicted a conservative ratio of **65% (Shims) vs 35% (Wedges)**.\n* **Reasoning:** It treated both as general \"construction aids\" and hedged its bet (Regression to the mean).\n\n**Method B: The Open Conversation (Me)** I just asked: \"Which one will be more popular?\" and followed up with \"What are the expected sales numbers?\". I gave no strict constraints.\n\n* **Result:** It predicted a massive difference of **8 to 1 (Ratio)**.\n* **Reasoning:** Because the AI wasn't \"boxed in\" by a strict prompt, it freely associated and found a key variable: **Consumability**.\n   * *Shims* remain in the wall forever (100% consumable/recurring revenue).\n   * *Wedges* are often removed and reused by pros (low replacement rate).\n\n**The Analysis (Verified by the LLM)** I fed both chat logs back to a different LLM for analysis. Its conclusion was fascinating: By using the \"Super Prompt,\" we inadvertently constrained the model. We built a box and asked the AI to fill it. By using the \"Open Conversation,\" the AI built the box itself. It was able to identify \"hidden variables\" (like the disposable nature of the product) that we didn't know to include in the prompt instructions.\n\n**My Takeaway:** Meta-Prompting seems great for *Production* (e.g., \"Write a blog post in format X\"), but actually inferior for *Diagnosis & Analysis* because it limits the AI's ability to search for \"unknown unknowns.\"\n\n**The Question:** Does anyone else experience this? Do we over-engineer our prompts to the point where we make the model dumber? Or was this just a lucky shot? I’d love to hear your experiences with \"Lazy Prompting\" vs. \"Super Prompting.\"",

      "text": "You spend 10 minutes crafting the perfect AI prompt. You explain every detail. You add context. You're polite. \n\nThe result? Generic fluff that sounds like every other AI response.\n\nHere's what actually works: shorter commands that cut straight to what you need.\n\n## The Counter-Intuitive Truth About AI Prompts\n\nMost people think longer prompts = better results. They're wrong.\n\nThe best AI responses come from micro-prompts - focused commands that tell AI exactly what role to play and what to do. No fluff. No explanations. Just direct instructions that work.\n\n## Start With Role Assignment\n\nBefore you ask for anything, tell AI who to be. Not \"act as an expert\" - that's useless. Be specific.\n\n**Generic (Gets You Nothing):**\n- Act as an expert\n- Act as a writer  \n- Act as an advisor\n\n**Specific (Gets You Gold):**\n- Act as a small business consultant who's helped 200+ companies increase revenue\n- Act as an email copywriter specializing in e-commerce brands\n- Act as a career coach who helps people switch industries\n\nThe more specific the role, the better the response. Instead of searching all human knowledge, AI focuses on that exact expertise.\n\n## Power Words That Transform AI Responses\n\nThese single words consistently beat paragraph-long prompts:\n\n**Audit** - Turns AI into a systematic analyst finding problems you missed\n- \"Act as business consultant. Audit our customer service process\"\n- \"Act as marketing strategist. Audit this product launch plan\"\n\n**Clarify** - Kills jargon and makes complex things crystal clear\n- \"Clarify this insurance policy for new homeowners\"\n- \"Clarify our return policy for the customer service team\"\n\n**Simplify** - Universal translator for complexity\n- \"Simplify this tax document for first-time filers\"\n- \"Simplify our investment strategy for new clients\"\n\n**Humanize** - Transforms robotic text into natural conversation\n- \"Humanize this customer apology email\"\n- \"Humanize our company newsletter\"\n\n**Stack** - Generates complete resource lists with tools and timelines\n- \"Stack: planning a wedding on $15,000 budget\"\n- \"Stack: starting a food truck business from zero\"\n\n## Two-Word Combinations That Work Magic\n\n**Think backwards** - Reveals root causes by reverse-engineering problems\n- \"Sales are down despite great reviews. Think backwards\"\n- \"Team morale dropped after the office move. Think backwards\"\n\n**Zero fluff** - Eliminates verbosity instantly\n- \"Explain our new pricing structure. Zero fluff\"\n- \"List Q3 business priorities. Zero fluff\"\n\n**More specific** - Surgical precision tool when output is too generic\n- Get initial response, then say \"More specific\"\n\n**Fix this:** - Activates repair mode (the colon matters)\n- \"Fix this: email campaign with terrible open rates\"\n- \"Fix this: meeting that runs 45 minutes over\"\n\n## Structure Commands That Control Output\n\n**[Topic] in 3 bullets** - Forces brutal prioritization\n- \"Why customers are leaving in 3 bullets\"\n- \"Top business priorities in 3 bullets\"\n\n**Explain like I'm 12** - Gold standard for simple explanations\n- \"Explain why profit margins are shrinking like I'm 12\"\n- \"Explain cryptocurrency risks like I'm 12\"\n\n**Checklist format** - Makes any process immediately executable\n- \"Checklist format: opening new retail location\"\n- \"Checklist format: hiring restaurant staff\"\n\n## Power Combination Stacks\n\nThe real magic happens when you combine techniques:\n\n**Business Crisis Stack:**\n```\nAct as turnaround consultant. Sales dropped 30% this quarter. \nThink backwards. Challenge our assumptions. Pre-mortem our recovery plan. \nAction items in checklist format.\n```\n\n**Marketing Fix Stack:**\n```\nAct as copywriter. Audit this product page. \nWhat's wrong with our messaging? Humanize the language. Zero fluff.\n```\n\n**Customer Service Stack:**\n```\nAct as customer experience expert. Review scores dropped to 3.2 stars. \nThink backwards. Fix this: our service process. Now optimize.\n```\n\n## The 5-Minute Workflow That Actually Works\n\n**Minute 1:** Start minimal\n- \"Act as retail consultant. Why are customers leaving without buying? Think backwards\"\n\n**Minutes 2-3:** Layer iteratively  \n- \"More specific\"\n- \"Challenge this analysis\" \n- \"What's missing?\"\n\n**Minute 4:** Structure output\n- \"Action plan in checklist format\"\n- \"Template this for future issues\"\n\n**Minute 5:** Final polish\n- \"Zero fluff\"\n- \"Now optimize for immediate implementation\"\n\n## Critical Mistakes That Kill Results\n\n**Too many commands** - Stick to 3 max per prompt. More confuses AI.\n\n**Missing the colon** - \"Fix this:\" works. \"Fix this\" doesn't. The colon activates repair mode.\n\n**Being polite** - Skip \"please\" and \"thank you.\" They waste processing power.\n\n**Over-explaining context** - Let AI fill intelligent gaps. Don't drown it in backstory.\n\n**Generic roles** - \"Expert\" tells AI nothing. \"Senior marketing manager with 8 years in consumer psychology\" gives focused expertise.\n\n## Advanced Analysis Techniques\n\n**Pre-mortem this** - Imagines failure to prevent it\n- \"Pre-mortem this: launching new restaurant location next month\"\n\n**Challenge this** - Forces AI to question instead of validate\n- \"Our strategy targets millennials with Facebook ads. Challenge this\"\n\n**Devil's advocate** - Generates strong opposing perspectives  \n- \"Devil's advocate: remote work is better for our small business\"\n\n**Brutally honestly** - Gets unfiltered feedback\n- \"Brutally honestly: critique this business pitch\"\n\n## Real-World Power Examples\n\n**Sales Problem:**\n```\nAct as sales consultant. Revenue down 25% despite same traffic. \nBrutally honestly. What's wrong with our sales funnel? \nFix this: entire sales process. Checklist format.\n```\n\n**Team Issues:**\n```\nAct as management consultant. Productivity dropped after new system. \nThink backwards. What's missing from our understanding? \nPlaybook for improvement.\n```\n\n**Customer Crisis:**\n```\nAct as customer experience director. Complaints up 300% after policy change. \nPre-mortem our damage control. Crisis playbook in checklist format.\n```\n\n## Why This Works\n\nMost people think AI needs detailed instructions. Actually, AI works best with clear roles and focused commands. When you tell AI to \"act as a specific expert,\" it accesses targeted knowledge instead of searching everything.\n\nShort commands force AI to think strategically instead of filling space with generic content. The result is specific, actionable advice you can use immediately.\n\n## Start With One Technique\n\nPick one power word (audit, clarify, simplify) and try it today. Add a specific role. Use \"zero fluff\" to cut the nonsense.\n\nYou'll get better results in 30 seconds than most people get from 10-minute prompts.\n\nKeep visiting our free free [mega-prompt collection.](https://tools.eq4c.com/)",

      "text": "After breaking the same agent three times in different projects, I finally stopped pretending vector search was memory.\n\nIt’s not. It’s closer to \"grep with vibes.\"\n\nWhat kept biting me wasn’t retrieval quality,  it was state drift. Preferences changing, facts going stale, and the model confidently reasoning over absolute garbage because I treated everything as “just context”.\n\nThe Context Window is a lie. Or at least, it's a temporary workspace we keep trying to treat like a hard drive. It doesn't work. Most of us try to solve this by dumping more chat history into the prompt, but after a year of building personalized AI tools, I realized vector search is just a 'search'... it isn't memory.\n\nI ended up copy-pasting the same ugly memory-handling logic everywhere, so I finally pulled it out into a separate layer. I’m reluctantly calling it an “OS” (Memory Operating System) — and yeah, I know that sounds a bit cringe, but hear me out: it’s because it manages the lifecycle, not because it’s a cool buzzword.\n\nThe \"Search-before-think\" Disaster\n\nIn my first naive implementation, the TTFT (Time to First Token) was a UX nightmare. If you’re waiting for a complex semantic search to finish before the model even starts generating, the 'snappiness' is gone.\n\nI had to implement Next-Scene Prediction. The system predicts which memories will be needed based on the current flow and pre-loads them into the KV cache. It makes 8B to 72B models feel way faster because the context is already \"warm\" by the time the user finishes typing.\n\nFact vs. Preference (Managing the Drift)\n\nThe biggest mistake I made for months was treating all retrieved data the same. That leads to hallucinations. You have to split it:\n\n\\- Fact Memory: \"User is on Python 3.12.\" (Objective).\n\n\\- Preference Memory: \"User prefers concise code.\" (Evolves over time).\n\nI built MemOS to handle this via MemCubes. It automatically extracts these into structured units so the AI actually learns from feedback. Here’s the production output:\n\nJSON\n\n{\n\n\"cube\\_id\": \"mem\\_99281\",\n\n\"type\": \"explicit\\_preference\",\n\n\"content\": \"User dislikes Tailwind CSS; prefers styled-components.\",\n\n\"status\": \"active\",\n\n\"priority\": 0.95\n\n}\n\nWhy the \"Lifecycle\" matters:\n\nA database just stores strings. This layer handles a 'Four-Step Judgment' to prevent garbage from overwriting important context:\n\n1. Generating: Turning raw dialogue into a MemCube.\n\n2. Merging: If a user says 'I moved to London' then later 'I live in Soho,' it merges them into one spatial context instead of having two conflicting entries.\n\n3. Archiving: Moving stale info out of the active window to save tokens without losing the 'seed'.\n\nOpen Source:\n\nI wanted this to be lightweight. You can self-host the whole thing; it runs fine on a 16GB VPS alongside an Ollama stack. There’s a cloud version if you just want to addMessage via API, but the core logic is all about the dynamic side of AI learning.\n\nIf you're struggling with 'chunk drift' or your agents have the memory of a goldfish, this might save you a few weeks of headaches.\n\n\\- Github: https://github.com/MemTensor/MemOS\n\n\\- Docs: https://memos-docs.openmem.net/cn\n\nCurious how others are handling state drift? Are you treating memory as a growing log, or are you actually managing a lifecycle?  Poke around and let me know where I’m wrong.)",

It's basically a museum of how these companies tell their models to behave when nobody's looking.\n\nOn one hand? Yeah, it's genuinely useful. Seeing how Anthropic structures citations or how OpenAI handles refusals is worth studying if you're serious about prompt engineering. You can reverse-engineer patterns that actually work instead of cargo-culting Medium articles written by people who discovered GPT last Tuesday.\n\nOn the other hand? We're literally documenting attack surfaces and calling it research. Every jailbreak attempt, every \"ignore previous instructions\" exploit starts with understanding the system layer. I've been in infosec long enough to know that \"educational purposes\" is what we say before someone weaponizes it.\n\nThe repo author even admits they're hesitant to share extraction methods because labs might patch them. Which, you know, proves my point.\n\nSo here's my question for this subreddit: Are we learning how to build better prompts, or are we just teaching people how to break guardrails faster? Because from where I'm sitting, this feels like publishing the blueprints to every lock in town and hoping only locksmiths read it.\n\nWhat's the actual value here beyond satisfying curiosity?",

In LLMs, knowing the system prompt doesn't let you patch anything ...it only lets you construct a better adversarial attack. You, as a user, cannot \"fix\" the prompt. Only the vendor can. So what exactly is the \"level playing field\" achieving here, other than faster exploitation?\n\nReal defense in depth means layers of protection. Hiding the prompt is *one* layer. Is it the only one? No. But stripping it away because \"security by obscurity is bad\" is like removing the camouflage from a tank because \"armor should be enough.\" It's tactically illiterate.",

I’m hoping for something that can help structure content, suggest engaging hooks, and keep my style consistent.\n\nI mostly create educational and tutorial videos, so i need scripts that are clear, concise, and flow naturally when spoken. Bonus if the tool or method helps with pacing, segment ideas, or variations for testing different formats.\n\nSo far, I’ve experimented with AI text generators and a few template-based tools, but either the scripts felt too generic or required too much rewriting to be usable.\n\nFor those who have experience, what approaches or tools have genuinely improved your YouTube scripting process?? Which features actually make a difference, and which ones are more hype than helpful?",

And with that, I have made actually a tool for myself to make videos for me. Might work for you, but yeah, you can also make your own. So let me know if you want to try that.",
