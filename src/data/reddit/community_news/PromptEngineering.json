Similar to Matt's content - Sometimes they may dig a bit deeper into the tools and breakdown.\n\nAlso check out Peter H. Diamandis’ channel — he tracks the latest AI news and politics with a weekly panel that sometimes includes Emad Mostaque (former Stability AI CEO). It’s a great mix of insight and debate from people actually in the AI space.\n\nAlso on Spotify \"AI Applied\" both of the guys on that Podcast also get into all the tools for building stuff and not super technical, so anybody can listen in and get some great ideas. And also \"AI Hustle\" is another good Podcast to add if you want add a Spotify section. ",

      "text": "I'm a consulting engineer - Chartered (mechanical), 15 years in simulation modelling. I code Python but I'm not a software developer, if that distinction makes sense. Over the past several months I've been going deep on Claude Code, specifically trying to understand what someone with domain expertise but no real development background can actually build with it.\n\nThe answer was more than I expected. I kept seeing the same pattern - PMs prototyping their own tools, analysts building things they'd normally wait six months for IT to deliver, operations people automating workflows they'd been begging engineering to prioritise. People who knew exactly *what* they needed but couldn't build it themselves. Until now.\n\nSo I wrote a book about it. \"Claude Code for the Rest of Us\" - 23 chapters, covering everything from setup and first conversations through to building web prototypes, creating reusable skills, and actually deploying what you've built. It's aimed at technically capable people who don't write code for a living - product managers, analysts, designers, engineers in non-software domains, ops leads. That kind of person.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/etokrldwg6ig1.png?width=1410&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c5644af91211e6b8b98f3ddb76b21caf79fd87\n\nI'm giving away free copies in exchange for honest feedback. I want genuine reactions before the wider launch (and especially before the paper copy), and right now that feedback is worth more to me than anything else.\n\nLink to grab a copy: [https://schoolofsimulation.com/claude-code-book](https://schoolofsimulation.com/claude-code-book)\n\nFor transparency on the email thing: you get the book immediately. I'll follow up in a few days and in a couple of weeks I'll let you know when the paperback comes out. You can unsubscribe the moment the book lands - no hard feelings and no guilt-trip follow-up sequence.\n\nIf you read it and have thoughts - this thread, DMs, reply to the delivery email, whatever works. I'm especially curious whether the non-developer framing actually lands for the people it's aimed at, or whether I've misjudged who needs this.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the book or about using Claude Code without a software engineering background.",

I had full of questions and just couldn't find my answers.\n\nAnd then ai showed up and came into our lives. Since I learnt basic concepts in CS, my productivity (and company's productivity) was multiplied by 20 folds. It still surprises me how much a person with ai can do when the person knows what to do. \"How to do\" is the task of ai.\n\nSo yeah, I agree that any professional with ai in a specific discipline is more successful than a software professional with ai in that specific discipline.\n\nPs: I'm learning and practicing coding (not vibe coding) with great efficiency thanks to ai. I'm kinda old school learner who needs a mentor for learning and I've found that mentor. Damn, I even started to learn rust as second language.",

They COULD make the model actually READ all the references it cites and have a tool that actually CHECKS if the citations are correct. The company COULD entrain TAGS that would make it clear to the model WHERE the info came from and give it the ability to RECOGNIZE „wait a minute, I don’t remember an associated tag, maybe this is hallucinated“. And yes, reducing hallucinations would dramatically increase utility.\n\nWhy don’t they do this? Because they don’t care. The only thing they care about is BETTER MODELS to win the race to achieve AGI first internally to become invincible. THEY DO NOT CARE about model utility in the meanwhile. They DO NOT CARE if those models are and keep staying TOYS. Hell, they dont even care about the user interface. Companies could have introduced FOLDERS three years ago, with automated sorting, recently data from whole conversations just disappeared in Gemini. They could have trained models that understand their own user interface so when the user has questions, they could help instead of hallucination settings. Gemini hallucinates content of pictures when you activate Canvas. Why the fuck not TRAIN the model to NOT DO THIS. ITS EASY. They COULD have trained models to understand just simply even their VERSION NUMBER and associates real existing features. They COULD make the model see when the context window is filled up because the user does not notice and then you get garbage. ALL of this is easy and would dramatically increase utility.\n\nBut companies DO NOT CARE about end customer utility. That no serious professional can use them. They DO NOT CARE that models hallucinate. They do not care about the end customer. They just want to improve existing models as fast as they can to get to AGI, everything inbetween, if it has utility or not, they do not care.",

It’s not actually integrating lived experience, it’s pattern-aligning to the style and concepts in the doc.\n\nSo I agree better context reduces inference 100%.  \nBut I dont think it removes the fundamental issue: it can still produce something that feels structurally deep and is subtly wrong.\n\nIn your experience, does feeding it those artifacts reduce logical errors, or mostly improve tone / structure?",

      "text": "Everyone's sharing prompt templates. \"Use this magic prompt!\" \"10x your output!\" Cool. Now use that same prompt next week on a different topic and watch it fall apart.\n\nThe problem isn't the prompt. It's everything around it.\n\n---\n\n## Why the same prompt gives different results every time\n\nA prompt is maybe 5% of what determines output quality. The rest is context — what the model knows, remembers, can access, and is told to ignore before it even reads your instruction.\n\nMost people engineer the 5% and leave the other 95% to chance. Then blame the model when results are inconsistent.\n\n---\n\n## What actually controls output quality\n\nThink of it as layers:\n\n**Layer 1 — Identity.** Not \"you are a helpful assistant.\" That's useless. Specific domain, specific expertise, specific constraints on what this persona does NOT do. The boundaries matter more than the capabilities.\n\n**Layer 2 — Scope control.** What should the model refuse to touch? What's out of bounds? Models are better at avoiding things than achieving things. A clear \"never do X\" outperforms a vague \"try to do Y\" every time.\n\n**Layer 3 — Process architecture.** Not \"think step by step.\" Actual phases. \"First, analyze X. Then, evaluate against Y criteria. Then, generate Z format.\" Give it a workflow, not a vibe.\n\n**Layer 4 — Self-verification.** This is where 99% of prompts fall short. Before the model outputs anything, it should check its own work:\n\n```\nBEFORE RESPONDING, VERIFY:\n- Does this answer the actual question asked?\n- Are all claims grounded in provided information?\n- Is the tone consistent throughout?\n- Would someone use this output without editing?\n\nIf any check fails → revise before outputting.\n```\n\nAdding this single block to any prompt is the highest-ROI change you can make. Four lines. Massive difference.\n\n---\n\n## The anti-pattern filter (underrated technique)\n\nModels have autopilot phrases. When you see \"delve,\" \"landscape,\" \"crucial,\" \"leverage,\" \"seamlessly\" — the model isn't thinking. It's pattern-matching to its most comfortable output.\n\nForce it off autopilot:\n\n```\nBLOCKED PATTERNS:\n- Words: delve, landscape, crucial, leverage, seamlessly, robust, holistic\n- Openings: \"In today's...\", \"It's important to note...\"\n- Closings: \"...to the next level\", \"...unlock your potential\"\n```\n\nThis sounds aggressive but it works. When you block default patterns, the model has to actually process your request instead of reaching for its template responses.\n\n---\n\n## Constraint-first vs instruction-first\n\nMost prompts start with what to do: \"Write a blog post about X.\"\n\nFlip it. Start with what NOT to do:\n\n- Don't add claims beyond provided information\n- Don't use passive voice for more than 20% of sentences\n- Don't exceed 3 paragraphs per section\n- Don't use any word from the blocked list\n\nThen give the task.\n\nWhy? Instructions are open-ended — the model interprets them however it wants. Constraints are binary — either violated or not. Models handle binary checks much more reliably than creative interpretation.\n\n---\n\n## The module approach (for anyone building prompts regularly)\n\nStop writing monolithic prompts. Build modules:\n\n- **Role module** (reusable identity block)\n- **Constraint module** (domain-specific boundaries)\n- **Process module** (task-type methodology)\n- **Verification module** (quality gate)\n\nSwap and combine per use case. A legal analysis uses the same verification module as a marketing brief — but different role and constraint modules.\n\nThis is how you go from \"I have a prompt\" to \"I have a system.\"\n\n---\n\n## One thing people get wrong about token efficiency\n\nEveryone wants shorter prompts. But they compress the wrong parts.\n\nDon't compress constraints — those need to be explicit and unambiguous.\n\nCompress examples. One clear example of what \"done right\" looks like beats five mediocre ones. Show the gold standard once. The model gets it.\n\n---\n\n## The real shift happening right now\n\nThe models are smart enough. They've been smart enough for a while. The bottleneck moved from model capability to information architecture — what you feed the model before asking your question.\n\nThis isn't about finding magic words anymore. It's about designing environments where good output becomes inevitable rather than accidental.\n\nThat's the actual skill. And honestly, it's more engineering than writing. You're building systems, not sentences.\n\n---\n\nCurious what techniques others are using. Especially around verification chains and constraint design — that's where I keep finding the biggest quality jumps.",

      "text": "I've been building out a collection of AI prompts for enterprise use, and one thing that kept bugging me was that most Copilot prompt lists assume you have the full Microsoft 365 Copilot license.\n\nSo I pulled together 50 prompts that work with the free/standard Copilot — no integrations, no premium features required.\n\nHere are 10 to start:\n\n**Email & Communication:**\n\n1. \"Draft a professional reply to \\[paste email\\] that addresses their concerns while maintaining our position on \\[topic\\]. Keep it under 150 words.\"\n2. \"Rewrite this message to be more diplomatic without losing the core ask: \\[paste text\\]\"\n3. \"Create 3 subject line options for an email about \\[topic\\] that will get opened\"\n\n**Analysis & Summaries:** 4. \"Summarize the key decisions, action items, and owners from these meeting notes: \\[paste notes\\]\" 5. \"Compare these two approaches and give me a pros/cons table: \\[describe options\\]\" 6. \"Extract the 5 most important data points from this report and explain why they matter: \\[paste excerpt\\]\"\n\n**Writing & Content:** 7. \"Turn these bullet points into a professional executive summary for a \\[audience\\] audience: \\[paste bullets\\]\" 8. \"Review this text for clarity, tone, and grammar. Suggest improvements but keep my voice: \\[paste text\\]\" 9. \"Create an agenda for a \\[duration\\] meeting about \\[topic\\] with \\[number\\] participants\"\n\n**Problem Solving:** 10. \"I'm facing \\[describe problem\\]. Walk me through a structured approach to solve it, starting with the most likely root causes.\"\n\nThe full set of 50 covers quick analysis, writing, brainstorming, data work, and communication — all tested in actual work scenarios.\n\nHappy to share the rest if this is useful.

Pricing limits can be frustrating.\n* **Bolt.** Browser-based, extremely fast for prototypes with one-click deploy. Excellent for demos, weaker on backend depth.\n* **UI Bakery AI App Generator.** Low-code plus AI hybrid. Best fit for production-ready internal tools (RBAC, SSO, SOC 2, on-prem).\n* **DronaHQ AI.** Strong CRUD and admin builder with AI-assisted visual editing.\n* **ToolJet AI.** Open-source option with good AI debugging capabilities.\n* **Superblocks (Clerk).** Early stage, but promising for enterprise internal applications.\n* **GitHub Copilot.** Best day-to-day coding assistant. Not an app builder, but a major productivity boost.\n* **Cursor IDE.** AI-first IDE with project-wide edits using Claude. Feels like Copilot plus more context.\n\n**Best use cases**\n\n* Use **Lovable** or **Bolt** for MVPs and rapid prototypes.\n* Use **Copilot** or **Cursor** for coding productivity.\n* Use **UI Bakery**, **DronaHQ**, or **ToolJet** for maintainable internal tools.\n\nWhat’s your go-to setup for building apps, and why?",

So I just... made my own.\n\n5 courses, 8 lessons each, completely free. No account needed. I'm the one who built them so take this with that grain of salt, but I tried to make them actually useful rather than just impressive-sounding :)\n\nHere's the order I'd recommend:\n\n[**AI Fundamentals**](https://findskill.ai/courses/ai-fundamentals/) — 2 hours. Start here if you've mostly been typing random stuff into ChatGPT and hoping for the best. Covers how LLMs actually work, why your prompts suck, and how to fix them.\n\n[**Prompt Engineering**](https://findskill.ai/courses/prompt-engineering/) — 3 hours. This is where it gets good. Few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, the RACE framework. Basically the difference between getting mid outputs and getting outputs that actually save you time.\n\n[**Better Writing with AI**](https://findskill.ai/courses/writing-better/) — 2 hours. Not \"make AI write everything for you.\" More like how to use it as an editor that actually makes your writing better. The lesson on beating the blank page alone was worth building.\n\n[**Research Smarter with AI**](https://findskill.ai/courses/research-and-learning/) — 2 hours. How to tell when AI is giving you solid info vs confidently making stuff up. Source evaluation, cross-referencing, building study materials. Most people skip this and it shows.\n\n[**Critical Thinking with AI**](https://findskill.ai/courses/critical-thinking/) — 2 hours. Spotting biases, catching logical fallacies, using AI to poke holes in your own arguments. Honestly this one's useful even if you never touch AI again.\n\n\\~11 hours total. There's a quiz and certificate at the end of each if you're into that. :D\n\nAnyway, happy to answer questions if anyone has them.",

      "text": "I’ve had really solid results from building workflows of AI agents and routing them through different models.\n\nFor example, I ask Claude to generate a blog post outline, then feed that back into a prompt to generate the full content. I then pass it to Gemini to “fact check” and add any citations that might be useful.\n\nFinally, I send it back to Claude again. I’m finding this approach pretty effective, and it’s nothing new. I know others are doing something similar, and it feels like the o1-preview model from OpenAI follows a related pattern.\n\nI’m thinking about building a very simple drag-and-drop workflow tool that lets you connect agents visually. It would be free to use, and you’d just generate an API URL with an input. You could then configure your agents and either return the output to the same API request or trigger a webhook.\n\nYou’d be able to split outputs into JSON keys, and I’d also add some basic logic to detect faulty responses and automatically adjust when needed.\n\nIt would be free with “bring your own keys,” or paid if you want to use our keys at a small discount.\n\nFirst, would people actually be interested in a tool like this? I couldn’t really find one that does exactly this. Second, what features would you want to see?\n\nI know LangChain and similar tools are powerful, but I find them a bit complex for non-coders and other stakeholders when trying to visually explain how everything works.\n\nUpdate: I built the tool. [https://aiflowtool.com/]() lets you connect AI prompts across Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT. It’s still in beta, but I’d love to hear any feedback.",

      "text": "I've realized that AI becomes actually useful when you prompt it to work with your anxious brain patterns instead of pretending they don't exist.\n\nIt's like finally having a copilot who gets why you need to plan for seventeen different worst-case scenarios before leaving the house.\n\n**1. \"Walk me through the actual probability here\"**\n\nThe anxiety reality check.\n\n> \"I think I'm getting fired because my boss said 'we need to talk.' Walk me through the actual probability here.\"\n\nAI breaks down your spiraling thoughts into statistical likelihood instead of catastrophic certainty, giving your logical brain something to hold onto.\n\n**2. \"What's the concrete next step, not the entire mountain?\"**\n\nBecause anxiety makes everything feel like solving world hunger when you just need to send an email.\n\n> \"I'm anxious about my presentation. What's the concrete next step, not the entire mountain?\"\n\nAI isolates the single action that moves you forward without triggering the overwhelm cascade.\n\n**3. \"Design a backup plan that makes my brain shut up\"**\n\nThe \"what if\" insurance policy.\n\n> \"Design a backup plan for my job interview that makes my brain shut up about everything going wrong.\"\n\nAI creates the safety net your anxiety demands so you can actually focus on the main plan.\n\n**4. \"Reframe this in a way that doesn't make my nervous system explode\"**\n\nBecause how you phrase things to an anxious brain matters desperately.\n\n> \"I have to confront my roommate about rent. Reframe this in a way that doesn't make my nervous system explode.\"\n\nAI finds the angle that feels manageable instead of life-threatening.\n\n**5. \"What's the evidence-based response to this thought spiral?\"**\n\nThe anxiety fact-checker.\n\n> \"I'm convinced everyone at the party hated me. What's the evidence-based response to this thought spiral?\"\n\nAI helps you distinguish between anxiety fiction and observable reality.\n\n**6. \"Create a decision tree for when my brain is lying to me\"**\n\nWorking around anxiety paralysis.\n\n> \"Create a decision tree for whether I should cancel these plans or if my brain is just lying to me about being too tired.\"\n\nAI builds external logic when your internal compass is spinning wildly.\n\n**7. \"What would I tell my friend if they brought me this problem?\"**\n\nThe self-compassion translator.\n\n> \"I made a small mistake at work and I'm convinced I'm incompetent. What would I tell my friend if they brought me this problem?\"\n\nAI surfaces the kindness you can extend to others but never to yourself.\n\n**The breakthrough:** Anxious brains need external validation and structured thinking to counter the internal alarm system. AI becomes that on-demand logical voice when your own is screaming.\n\n**Advanced move:**\n\n> \"My anxiety is saying [catastrophic thought]. Generate 5 alternative explanations that are equally or more likely.\"\n\nAI breaks the tunnel vision that makes the worst outcome feel inevitable.\n\n**The pre-mortem twist:**\n> \"I'm worried about [situation]. Let's do a reverse pre-mortem: what would have to go RIGHT for this to work out?\"\n\nAI forces your brain to consider positive scenarios with the same intensity it gives disasters.\n\n**The social anxiety decoder:**\n\n> \"I'm replaying [social interaction]. What are the non-catastrophic interpretations of what happened?\"\n\nAI offers the charitable readings your anxiety won't let you access.\n\n**Rumination circuit breaker:**\n\n> \"I've been stuck on [thought] for [time]. What's the pattern here and how do I interrupt it?\"\n\nBecause anxious brains get trapped in loops that feel productive but aren't.\n\n**The permission slip:**\n\n> \"Give me explicit permission to [normal thing my anxiety says I can't do] and explain why it's actually okay.\"\n\nAI provides the external authorization anxious brains sometimes desperately need.\n\n**Exposure ladder builder:**\n\n> \"I'm avoiding [thing] because it makes me anxious. Build an exposure ladder with tiny incremental steps.\"\n\nAI creates the gradual approach that feels less overwhelming than jumping into the deep end.\n\n**Thought record assistant:**\n\n> \"I'm feeling [emotion] about [situation]. Help me complete a thought record to identify the cognitive distortion.\"\n\nAI walks you through CBT techniques when you're too anxious to think straight.\n\n**The grounding protocol:**\n\n> \"I'm spiraling about [worry]. Give me a 3-step grounding exercise specific to this situation.\"\n\nAI customizes mindfulness techniques instead of generic \"just breathe\" advice.\n\n**Future self perspective:**\n\n> \"I'm panicking about [thing]. What will I think about this in six months?\"\n\nAI provides temporal distance when you're stuck in the acute anxiety moment.\n\n**Energy preservation:**\n\n> \"I have limited mental bandwidth today. Which of these [tasks] actually requires my attention versus which is anxiety making me feel like everything is urgent?\"\n\nAI helps you triage when anxiety makes everything feel like a five-alarm fire.\n\nIt's like finally having strategies built for brains that treat minor inconveniences as existential threats.\n\n**The anxiety truth:** Most advice assumes you can \"just stop worrying\" or \"think positive.\" Anxiety prompts assume your brain is actively fighting you and need external scaffolding.\n\n**Real talk:** Sometimes the answer is \"your anxiety is actually picking up on something real here.\" \"What's the legitimate concern underneath this reaction, and what's the anxiety amplification?\"\n\n**The somatic hack:** \"I'm feeling [physical anxiety symptoms]. What does my body actually need right now versus what my thoughts say I need?\"\n\nBecause anxiety lives in your nervous system, not just your head.\n\n**Meta-pattern recognition:**\n\n> \"I've been anxious about [type of situation] three times this month. What's the core fear and how do I address it directly instead of case by case?\"\n\nAI helps identify your recurring anxiety themes so you can work on root causes.\n\nFor simple, practical, and well-organized anxiety management prompts with real examples and specific use cases, check out our [AI toolkit resources](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

Those are different rarity types.\n\nImprovement applied in part 5:\n\t•\tI’ll target facts that are rare-in-culture and usually rare-in-the-world (restricted clades), and I’ll bias toward mechanistic facts that remain checkable.\n\n5) Improved “RARE” definition (operational)\n\nA “RARE animal fact” here means:\n\t•\tMost non-specialists are unlikely to know it, and\n\t•\tIt is tightly constrained (species/clade + mechanism), and\n\t•\tIt is counterintuitive but testable, not a loose trivia fragment.\n\n6) Five new animal facts (candidate rare set)\n\t1.\tAntarctic icefish (Channichthyidae) include species that lack hemoglobin, giving them “white” blood.\n\t2.\tMonotremes (platypus, echidnas) are egg-laying mammals with a mammalian lactation system.\n\t3.\tAxolotls can remain in a larval body plan (neoteny) while becoming sexually mature.\n\t4.\tMantis shrimp have an eye with many photoreceptor classes (more than humans) and specialized polarization sensitivity.\n\t5.\tA narwhal “tusk” is an elongated tooth with extensive innervation, functioning as a sensory organ.\n\n7) [reason] rarity review: why each is rare and why it’s not\n\n1) Icefish lack hemoglobin\n\t•\tWhy rare: extreme physiological exception among vertebrates; narrow clade in cold, oxygen-rich waters; strongly counterintuitive (“fish with no hemoglobin”).\n\t•\tWhy not rare: people who consume polar biology media may have heard it; also “lack hemoglobin” can be oversimplified without context (some related traits vary).\n\n2) Monotremes are egg-laying mammals\n\t•\tWhy rare: very small mammal lineage; contradicts the “mammals = live birth” default; easy to falsify/verify.\n\t•\tWhy not rare: it’s one of the more famous “weird mammal” facts (platypus is culturally prominent).\n\n3) Axolotl neoteny\n\t•\tWhy rare: developmental biology hook (neoteny) + clear constraint; unusual life-history strategy.\n\t•\tWhy not rare: axolotls became internet-famous; the term “neoteny” may be rare, but “they stay babies” is now semi-common.\n\n4) Mantis shrimp photoreceptor diversity\n\t•\tWhy rare: mechanistic sensory biology; most people don’t know what photoreceptor classes are; narrow taxa.\n\t•\tWhy not rare: “mantis shrimp sees more colors than you” is a well-shared pop-science headline; details are often distorted.\n\n5) Narwhal tusk is a sensory tooth\n\t•\tWhy rare: converts a “horn myth” into a dental + neural mechanism; precise and testable.\n\t•\tWhy not rare: narwhals are iconic; some documentaries mention the sensory aspect.\n\n8) How to improve the rarity score (method)\n\t•\tShift from “famous weird animals” to obscure clades (deep-sea, cave, parasitic, micro-fauna).\n\t•\tPrefer one-step-more-technical facts: mechanism + constraint, not headline.\n\t•\tTarget rare-in-the-world phenomena: traits present in very few lineages (loss of a major vertebrate protein, extreme reproductive modes, unique skeletal/vascular arrangements).\n\t•\tAvoid viral factoids that are widely repeated (even if true).\n\t•\tKeep claims tight (species/clade named) and non-exaggerated.\n\n9) Five final animal facts (plaintext code snippet)\n\nIcefish include lineages with no\nhemoglobin (white blood).\n\nThe hoatzin chick has wing claws\nused for climbing.\n\nMale deep-sea anglerfish can fuse\nto females as a parasite-mate.\n\nSome scaly-foot snails build iron-\nsulfide armor in their shells.\n\nCertain termites practice asexual\nqueen succession in colonies.",

The good stuff gets buried. The bad stuff gets repeated. There's no way to organize by use case, model, or effectiveness.\nWe need something that's like GitHub for prompts. \n\nWhere you can:\nDiscover what's actually working\nFork and improve existing prompts\nTrack versions as models change\nShare your workflow, not just one-off tips\n\nI found something like this -  [Beprompter ](http://beprompter.in)\nNot sure how many people know about it, but it's basically built for this exact problem. You can:\nShare prompts with the community\nTag which platform/model you used (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)\nBrowse by category/use case\nActually build a collection of prompts that work\nSee what other people are using for similar problems\nIt's like if Reddit and a prompt library had a baby that actually cared about organization.\n\nWhy this matters:\nWe're all out here testing the same techniques independently, sharing discoveries that get lost, and basically doing duplicate work.\n\nImagine if instead:\nYou could search \"React debugging prompts that work on Claude\"\nSee what's actually rated highly by people who use it\nAdapt it for your needs\nShare your version back\nThat's how knowledge compounds instead of disappearing.\n\nReal talk: Are people actually using platforms like this or are we all just gonna keep dropping fire prompts in Reddit comments that vanish into the ether?\n\nBecause I'm tired of screenshots of good prompts I can never find again when I actually need them.\nWhat's your workflow for organizing/discovering prompts that actually work?\n\nIf you don't believe just visit my profile in reddit you get to know .😮‍💨",

It uses Gemini but only works within your sources (mostly). I also use the custom reports to create guides, tutorials, and all types of things. \n\nNBLM is totally free and just requires a Google account. There are a lot of good tutorials out there for it too. \n\nI build a lot of prompts for things like QA and coaching for sales calls transcripts. I’ll build those prompts in ChatGPT or another model and then prompt my NBLM data with those meta prompts. \n\nIt’s most basic superpower though is research. If I have a seed topic I’ll use Perplexity and prompt it for 20 links to related content (Perplexity is great for sourcing). Then paste those links in as sources for NBLM. It’ll reach out to those sites for data when selected and prompted. Then you can save those codified results as a Note for reuse, scaling, recall, etc.",

Massive difference.\n\n# The biggest mistake beginners make\n\nMost people ask AI for solutions immediately.\n\nBut high-quality results usually come from:\n\nDiagnose first  \nThen ask for solutions\n\nThis alone changes output quality dramatically.\n\n# One prompt that helped me think differently\n\nHere’s one I still use when I’m stuck:\n\n    I’m stuck with [business problem].\n    Act as an experienced business consultant and operator.\n    \n    First, ask me 10 sharp diagnostic questions to identify the true root cause.\n    \n    Then give:\n    - Root cause analysis\n    - 3 ranked solutions (impact vs effort)\n    - Step-by-step execution plan\n    - Prevention systems\n    - 30-day measurable success definition\n    \n\nIf you’re new to this space, here’s something I wish I knew earlier:\n\nGeneric prompts = Generic results  \nStructured thinking prompts = Real leverage\n\n# Why this matters now\n\nPrompt engineering is quietly becoming a core skill.\n\nNot just for developers.  \nFor business, marketing, product, operations… everything.\n\nI started collecting real-world prompts like this while learning (especially beginner-friendly ones that actually solve business/work problems, not just generate text).\n\nSome people asked me to organize them, so I ended up turning them into a structured guide.\n\nIf you’re trying to go from “experimenting with AI” → to “actually using it for real work”, you’d probably find it useful.",

      "text": "After months of building and testing complex AI prompts (1000+ tokens), I landed on a modular structure that dramatically improved my output quality. I call it the \"5-Block Framework\":  \n  \n**Block 1 — Role Definition**  \nTell the model exactly who it is. Not just \"you are a helpful assistant\" — be specific: expertise level, communication style, domain knowledge boundaries.  \n  \n**Block 2 — Context & Background**  \nEverything the model needs to know about the situation. Separate this from the task so you can swap contexts without rewriting instructions.  \n  \n**Block 3 — Constraints & Rules**  \nWhat it must NOT do, word limits, tone requirements, formatting rules. I keep these in their own section so I can toggle them on/off for different use cases.  \n  \n**Block 4 — Examples (Few-Shot)**  \n2-3 examples of desired output. This is the single highest-leverage section — concrete examples beat lengthy instructions every time.  \n  \n**Block 5 — The Actual Task**  \nThe specific request. By the time you get here, the model has full context, knows the rules, and has seen examples. The task can be short and clear.  \n  \nThe key insight: Blocks 1, 3, and 4 are reusable across tasks. Only Blocks 2 and 5 change for each use. This means \\~60% of your prompt is pre-built.  \n\n\nthis tool helped me to create and manage my prompt  \n[https://www.promptbuilder.space/](https://www.promptbuilder.space/)\n\n  \nWhat structure do you use?

      "text": "I am sick and tired of the discourse that prompt engineering is a fad and that is dead.  \n  \nEvery few months, someone declares prompt engineering dead. First it was \"context engineering\" that replaced it. Then \"harnesses.\" Now some people argue that models will get so smart you won't need prompts at all. I think this is wrong, and I think the reason people keep getting it wrong is that they misunderstand what prompt engineering actually is.\n\nWhen most people hear \"prompt engineering,\" they picture a kind of alchemy. Special tricks to make the LLM behave. Phrases like \"solve this or I'll die\" that somehow improve outputs. Formatting hacks. Chain-of-thought incantations. And yes, with older models, some of that worked. Researchers found that certain phrasings produced better results for reasons nobody fully understood. But new models don't need any of that. You can write plain English with typos and they'll understand you fine. So if that's your definition of prompt engineering, then sure, it's dead.\n\nBut that was never what prompt engineering was really about.\n\nHere's a better way to think about it. An LLM, even a very powerful one, is like a genius on their first day at a new job. They're brilliant. They might even be smarter than everyone else in the room. But they know nothing about your company, your product, your customers, or how you want things done. Your job is to explain all of that.\n\nIf you're building a customer support bot, you need to describe what counts as a technical question versus a billing question, when to escalate, what tone to use. If you're building a marketing assistant, you need to spell out your brand guidelines, who your users are, whether you're formal or casual, what topics are off-limits. We do this ourselves at [Agenta](http://agenta.ai) with our own coding agents: here are our conventions, here's the abstraction style we prefer, here's what we allow and what we don't, because every codebase is opinionated. If you're building a health coaching agent, you need to lay out the clinical framework, the philosophy behind the approach, how often to check in with the user.\n\nWriting all of this down, iterating on it until the AI behaves the way you want, is prompt engineering. And if you've ever written a PRD, this should sound familiar. Product managers describe how a system should behave, what the flows look like, what the edge cases are. Prompt engineering is the same thing, except the system you're describing behavior for is an AI.\n\nContext engineering still matters. Getting the right information to the model at the right time is a real problem worth solving. But deciding what the AI should do with that information is harder, and that part is prompt engineering.\n\nPrompt engineering isn't dead. We just had the wrong definition.",

They’re being ridiculous. I do think maybe there’s almost too much faith in being able to literally do anything and everything for a truly scalable, secure, enterprise level app with only prompts. I think people will start to get better at identifying those gaps and adjust to filling them, instead of digging their heels in the sand about prompts and refusing to learn any infrastructure or CI/CD or anything like that. I think there’s this stupid tug of war going on right now between coders and prompt engineers and one day soon we’ll realize how silly it was, because you will almost always need some element of both.

Every single time.  \n  \nThreats scored the worst (24–25% win rate vs neutral).

Those extra tokens are noise.   \n  \nThe model doesn't care if you \"believe in it\" or offer $200. It needs clear instructions, not motivation.  \n  \nStop prompting AI like it's a person.

LLMs however are a bit more nuanced because they don’t just sit, they do literally exactly what you tell them to (minus guardrails). \n\nSo if you speak to it as if it is a friend who’s coming over for Christmas, that’s how it responds. If you speak to it like it’s a spreadsheet, that’s how it responds.",

Please label the 'User' and 'Gemini'\"*\n\n* Download the conversation from Canvas\n\n**Then:** Copy/paste into the other platform\n\n✅ Free ❌ Time-consuming if you switch daily\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n**Method 2: AI Context Flow (Automated)**\n\nThis gives exponential returns IF you switch frequently:\n\n* Chrome extension with universal memory layer\n* One-click to capture context from any AI platform\n* Organize everything in project-specific memory buckets\n* Upload files in bulk for each project\n* Deploy relevant context to ChatGPT or Gemini instantly\n* Auto-syncs across all your devices\n\n**Real results:** Users report saving 5-10 hours weekly\n\n**The workflow:** Build context once → Switch platforms freely → Inject context in 1-click\n\nUse ChatGPT for creative work, Gemini for real-time info - without starting over.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nFull guide with screenshots and setup steps: [https://plurality.network/blogs/switch-between-chatgpt-and-gemini/](https://plurality.network/blogs/switch-between-chatgpt-and-gemini/)",
