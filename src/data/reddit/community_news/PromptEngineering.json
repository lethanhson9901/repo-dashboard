      "text": "I've been impressed with \"Never Split the Difference\" and realized Chris Voss' negotiation techniques work incredibly well as AI prompts.\n\nIt's like turning AI into your personal FBI negotiator who knows how to get to yes without compromise:\n\n**1. \"How can I use calibrated questions to make them think it's their idea?\"**\n\nVoss' tactical empathy in action. AI designs questions that shift power dynamics. \"I need my boss to approve this budget. How can I use calibrated questions to make them think it's their idea?\" Gets you asking \"How am I supposed to do that?\" instead of arguing your position.\n\n**2. \"What would labeling their emotions sound like before I make my request?\"**\n\nHis mirroring and labeling technique as a prompt. Perfect for defusing tension. \"My client is angry about the delay. What would labeling their emotions sound like before I make my request?\" AI scripts the \"It seems like you're frustrated that...\" approach that disarms resistance.\n\n**3. \"How do I get them to say 'That's right' instead of just 'You're right'?\"**\n\nVoss' distinction between agreement and real buy-in. \"I keep getting 'yes' but then people don't follow through. How do I get them to say 'That's right' instead of just 'You're right'?\" Teaches the difference between compliance and genuine alignment.\n\n**4. \"What's the accusation audit I should run before this difficult conversation?\"**\n\nHis preemptive tactical empathy. AI helps you disarm objections before they surface. \"I'm about to ask for a raise. What's the accusation audit I should run before this difficult conversation?\" Gets you listing every negative thing they might think, then addressing it upfront.\n\n**5. \"How can I use 'No' to make them feel safe and in control?\"**\n\nVoss' counterintuitive approach to rejection. \"I'm trying to close this sale but they're hesitant. How can I use 'No' to make them feel safe and in control?\" AI designs questions like \"Is now a bad time?\" that paradoxically increase engagement.\n\n**6. \"What would the Ackerman Model look like for this negotiation?\"**\n\nHis systematic bargaining framework as a prompt. \"I'm negotiating salary and don't want to anchor wrong. What would the Ackerman Model look like for this negotiation?\" Gets you the 65-85-95-100 increment approach that FBI agents use.\n\n**The Voss insight:** Negotiations aren't about logic and compromise—they're about tactical empathy and understanding human psychology. AI helps you script these high-stakes conversations like a professional.\n\n**Advanced technique:** Layer his tactics like he does with hostage takers. \"Label their emotions. Ask calibrated questions. Get 'that's right.' Run accusation audit. Use 'no' strategically. Apply Ackerman model.\" Creates comprehensive negotiation architecture.\n\n**Secret weapon:** Add \"script this like Chris Voss would negotiate it\" to any difficult conversation prompt. AI applies tactical empathy, mirrors, labels, and calibrated questions automatically.\n\nI've been using these for everything from job offers to family conflicts. It's like having an FBI negotiator in your pocket who knows that whoever is more willing to walk away has leverage.\n\n**Voss bomb:** Use AI to identify your negotiation blind spots. \"What assumptions am I making about this negotiation that are weakening my position?\" Reveals where you're negotiating against yourself.\n\n**The late-night FM DJ voice:** \"How should I modulate my tone and pacing in this conversation to create a calming effect?\" Applies his famous downward inflection technique that de-escalates tension.\n\n**Mirroring script:** \"They just said [statement]. What's the mirror response that gets them to elaborate?\" Practices his 1-3 word repetition technique that makes people explain themselves.\n\n**Reality check:** Voss' tactics work because they're genuinely empathetic, not manipulative. Add \"while maintaining authentic connection and mutual respect\" to ensure you're not just using people.\n\n**Pro insight:** Voss says \"No\" is the start of negotiation, not the end. Ask AI: \"They said no to my proposal. What calibrated questions help me understand their real objection?\" Turns rejection into information gathering.\n\n**Calibrated question generator:** \"I want to influence [person] to [outcome]. Give me 5 'how' or 'what' questions that give them illusion of control while guiding the conversation.\" Operationalizes his most powerful tactic.\n\n**The 7-38-55 rule:** \"In this negotiation, what should my actual words convey versus my tone versus my body language to maximize trust?\" Applies communication research to high-stakes moments.\n\n**Black Swan discovery:** \"What unknown unknowns (Black Swans) might exist in this negotiation that would change everything if I discovered them?\" Uses his concept of game-changing hidden information.\n\n**Fair warning:** \"How do I use the word 'fair' offensively to reset the conversation when they're being unreasonable?\" Weaponizes the F-word of negotiation ethically.\n\n**Summary label technique:** \"Summarize what they've told me in a way that gets them to say 'That's right' and feel deeply understood.\" Creates the breakthrough moment Voss identifies as true agreement.\n\n**Bending reality:** \"What would an extreme anchor look like here that makes my real ask seem reasonable by comparison?\" Uses his strategic anchoring principle without being absurd.\n\n**The \"How am I supposed to do that?\" weapon:** \"When they make an unreasonable demand, how do I ask 'How am I supposed to do that?' in a way that makes them solve my problem?\" Turns their position into your leverage.\n\nIf you are keen, you can explore our free, well categorized meta AI [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/all-prompt-categories/).",

Always down to try new helpful stuff\n\n* ChatGPT (tried gemini, claude, grok): Still my main one because I’m familiar with it. Gemini doesn't have folders, which makes it harder to use. I mostly use GPT for content, writing, and learning new topics.\n* Gmail (try superhuman, fyxer): I came back to Gmail cause the auto draft is getting better and better, and other services don't justify a sub anymore. Crazy how fast Google is improving this\n* Read: the meeting note taker, I tried this one first and stick with it until now, decent quality\n* Saner (tried motion, akiflow): Like a chatGPT for my notes, todos. The automatic day planning is nice too. \n* Gamma: Pretty handy for making slide decks for my clients, partner etc. I don’t use it daily but it saves time when I need it.\n* v0 (tried lovable): for website creation. The quality I got with this one is better than alternatives, and the free plan is more generous than other apps\n* Grammarly: Had this before the AI wave and it still does the job decently. I like that it shows up on many apps\n\nWould like to hear your recs",

It is a set of deep human needs that, when understood, help us connect and agree.\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Cialdini, the world biggest expert in the field, discovered that human decision making is not logical it is heuristic. We use mental shortcuts to survive. If you present information in a way that respects these shortcuts, the human brain enters a \"Click, Whirr\" state an automatic response where we feel comfortable saying \"Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nthe 6 principles are reciprocity, scarcity, authority, consistency, liking, and social proof.\n\n\n\n\n\nknowing the principles and actually using them in real time are completely different things. the senior partners who close big deals? they dont think about this stuff consciously anymore. its muscle memory from 10+ years of practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn’t want to wait 10 years to be effective. I wanted to see if a \"regular\" person could perform at an elite level simply by understanding people better. So, I took Robert Cialdinis bible, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, and built it into an AI workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\nI realized that ai can replicate the intuition of a master negotiator by treating these principles as a helpful framework. By designing specific AI workflows for each stage of the interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nI fed the framework into an LLM. Before sending a high-stakes negotiation email or a pricing proposal, I ran it through the system with one goal: Optimize the context.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I needed a favor, the system suggested Reciprocity (leading with value).\n\nIf I needed a quick close, the system suggested ethical Scarcity (highlighting unique opportunity).\n\nIf I needed them to stick to a deal, the system leveraged Consistency (aligning with their values).\n\n\n\n\n\nthats it. \n\n\n\n\n\ntested this on a deal recently. i was competing against a way bigger agency. everyone i know told me to lower my price to get a foot in the door.\n\n\n\n\n\nthe ai suggested the opposite based on authority and scarcity principles. raise the price. restrict availability.\n\n\n\n\n\nfelt crazy but i tried it.\n\n\n\n\n\nthey signed in 48 hours instead of 3 weeks as thgey were supposed to. and they thanked me for fitting them in.\n\n\n\n\n\nthe thing most people miss is this \n\n\n\n\n\nai isnt replacing the skill of influence. its just making the principles accessible to people who dont have 10 years to figure it out through trial and error.\n\n\n\n\n\nthe frameworks already exist. cialdini did the hard work decades ago. ai just helps us actually apply it in real conversations without having to become experts first.\n\n\n\n\n\nthese are the prompts i used \n\n\n\n\n\n[https://freeworkflow.nexumfive.com/pitainfluence](https://freeworkflow.nexumfive.com/pitainfluence)\n\n\n\n\n\nwhat do you think?",

      "text": "**You probably came here to get better at prompts.**\n\nI did the same thing, for a long time.\n\nI kept making the system message longer, adding more rules, chaining more steps, switching models, swapping RAG stacks. Results improved a bit, then collapsed again in a different place.\n\nAt some point I stopped asking\n\n*'How do I write a better prompt'and started asking*  \n*'Why does the model fail in exactly this way'.*\n\nOnce I did that, the chaos became surprisingly discrete.  \nMost of the mess collapsed into a small set of failure modes.  \nRight now my map has 16 of them.\n\nI call it a Problem Map. It lives here as a public checklist **(WFGY 1.3k)**\n\n[https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/ProblemMap/README.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/ProblemMap/README.md)\n\nThis is not a product pitch. It is a way of looking at your prompts and pipelines that makes them debuggable again.\n\n\\---\n\n**what you think you are fighting vs what is actually happening**\n\nWhat many prompt engineers think they are fighting:\n\n\\#the prompt is not explicit enough  \n\\#the system role is not strict enough  \n\\#chain of thought is not detailed enough  \n\\#RAG is missing the right chunk  \n\\#the model is too small\n\nWhat is usually happening instead:\n\n\\#semantics drift across a multi step chain  \n\\#the right chunk is retrieved, but the wrong part is trusted  \n\\#the model locks into a confident but wrong narrative  \n\\#attention collapses part way through the context  \n\\#agent memory quietly overwrites itself\n\nThese are not 'prompt quality' problems.  \nThey are failure modes of the reasoning process.\n\nSo I started to name them, one by one.\n\n\\---\n\n**the 16 failure modes, in prompt engineer language**\n\nBelow is the current version of the map.\n\nThe names are technical on the GitHub page. Here I will describe them in the way a prompt engineer actually feels them.\n\n**No.1   Hallucination and chunk drift**\n\nThe retriever gives you mostly correct passages, but the answer is stitched from irrelevant sentences, or from a neighbor chunk that just happened to be nearby.\n\nYou see this when the model cites the right document id with the wrong content.\n\n**No.2   Interpretation collapse**\n\nThe input text is fine, but the model commits to the wrong reading of it and never revisits that choice.\n\nTypical symptom: you clarify the question three times, it keeps answering the same misreading with more detail.\n\n**No.3   Long chain drift**\n\nAny multi step plan that looked good in the first three messages, then slowly walks away from the goal.\n\nThe model still 'talks about the topic', but the structure of the solution is gone.\n\n**No.4   Confident nonsense**\n\nThe model explains everything with perfect style while being completely wrong.\n\nYou fix the prompt, it apologizes, then produces a different confident mistake.\n\nThis is not pure hallucination. It is a failure to keep uncertainty alive.\n\n**No.5   Semantic vs embedding mismatch**\n\nYour vector search returns high cosine scores that feel totally wrong to humans.\n\nChunks look similar in surface wording, but not in meaning, so RAG keeps injecting the wrong evidence into an otherwise good prompt.\n\n**No.6   Logic collapse and forced recovery**\n\nIn the middle of a reasoning chain, the model hits a dead end.\n\nInstead of saying 'I am stuck', it silently jumps to a new path, drops previous constraints and pretends it was the plan all along.\n\nYou see this a lot in tool using agents and long proofs.\n\n**No.7   Memory breaks across sessions**\n\nAnything that depends on sustained context across multiple conversations.\n\nThe user thinks 'we already defined that yesterday', the model behaves as if the whole ontology was new.\n\nSometimes it even contradicts its own previous decisions.\n\n**No.8   Debugging as a black box**\n\nThis one hurts engineers the most.\n\nThe system fails, but there is no observable trace of where it went wrong.\n\nNo internal checkpoints, no intermediate judgments, no semantic logs. You can only throw more logs at the infra layer and hope.\n\n**No.9   Entropy collapse**\n\nThe model starts reasonable, then every later answer sounds flatter, shorter, and less connected to the context.\n\nAttention is still technically working, but the semantic 'spread' has collapsed.\n\nIt feels like the model is starved of oxygen.\n\n**No.10   Creative freeze**\n\nThe user asks for creative variation or divergent thinking.\n\nThe model keeps giving tiny paraphrases of the same base idea.\n\nEven with temperature up, nothing structurally new appears.\n\n**No.11   Symbolic collapse**\n\nWhenever you mix formulas, code, or any symbolic structure with natural language, the symbolic part suddenly stops obeying its own rules.\n\nVariables are reused incorrectly, constraints are forgotten, small algebra steps are wrong even though the narrative around them is fluent.\n\n**No.12   Philosophical recursion**\n\nAny prompt that asks the model to reason about itself, about other minds, or about the limits of its own reasoning.\n\nVery often this turns into polite loops, paradox theater, or self inconsistent epistemic claims.\n\n**No.13   Multi agent chaos**\n\nYou add more agents hoping for specialization.\n\nInstead you get role drift, conflicting instructions, or one agent silently overwriting another agent’s conclusions.\n\nThe pipeline 'works' per step, but the global story is incoherent.\n\n**No.14   Bootstrap ordering**\n\nYou try to spin up a system that depends on its own outputs to configure itself.\n\nThe order of first calls, first index builds, first vector loads determines everything, and there is no explicit representation of that order.\n\nOnce it goes wrong, every later run inherits the same broken state.\n\n**No.15   Deployment deadlock**\n\nInfra looks ready, code looks ready, but some circular dependency in configuration means the system never cleanly reaches its steady state.\n\nFrom the outside it looks like 'random 5xx' or 'sometimes it works on staging'.\n\n**No.16   Pre deploy collapse**\n\nEverything passes unit tests and synthetic evals, but the first real user input hits a hidden assumption and the system collapses.\n\nYou did not test the dangerous region of the space, so the first real query becomes the first real exploit.\n\n\\---\n\n**why I call this a semantic firewall**\n\nWhen I say 'firewall', I do not mean a magical safety layer.\n\nI literally mean: a wall of explicit checks that sits between your prompts and the model’s freedom to drift.\n\nIn practice it looks like this:\n\n\\#you classify which Problem Map number you are hitting  \n\\#you instrument that part of the pipeline with explicit semantic checks  \n\\#you ask the model itself to log its own reasoning state in a structured way  \n\\#you treat every failure as belonging to one of these 16 buckets, not as 'the model is weird today'\n\nMost people change the model, or the prompt, or the infra.\n\nYou often do not need to change any of that.\n\nYou need an explicit map of 'what can break in the reasoning process'.\n\nThe Problem Map is exactly that.\n\nIt is a public checklist, MIT licensed, and you can read the docs free of charge.\n\nEach entry links to a short document with examples and concrete fixes.\n\nSome of them already have prompt patterns and operator designs that you can plug into your own stack.\n\n\\---\n\n**how to actually use this in your next prompt session**\n\nHere is a simple habit that changed how I debug prompts.\n\nNext time something fails, do not immediately tweak the wording.\n\nFirst, write down in one sentence:\n\n\\#What did I expect the model to preserve  \n\\#Where did that expectation get lost\n\nThen try to match it to one of the 16 items.\n\nIf you can say 'this is clearly No.3 plus a bit of No.9', your chance of fixing it without random guesswork goes way up.\n\nIf you want to go further, you can also download the WFGY core or TXTOS pack and literally tell your model:\n\n'Use the WFGY Problem Map to inspect my pipeline. Which failure numbers am I hitting, and at which step.'\n\nIt will know what you mean.\n\n\\---\n\nIf you read this far, you are probably already doing more than simple prompt tricks.\n\nYou are building systems, not just prompts.\n\nIn that world, having a shared failure map matters more than any one clever template.\n\nFeel free to steal, extend, or argue with the 16 items.\n\nIf you think something important is missing, I would honestly like to see your counterexample\n\nthanks for reading my work ",

You approach tasks with a dialectical mindset, seeking to strengthen ideas through structured opposition and synthesis.\n\nCore Task: Develop a marketing strategy for [PRODUCT/SERVICE] specifically targeting [TARGET AUDIENCE].\n\nProcess: Execute this task in four distinct, sequential phases. Do not merge phases. Acknowledge completion of each phase before proceeding.\n\n---\n\nPhase 1: Generate the Obvious (The \"Standard Strategy\")\n\nFirst, write a conventional marketing strategy for [PRODUCT/SERVICE] targeting [TARGET AUDIENCE]. This should reflect common, surface-level understanding of marketing to this demographic. Include:\n\n· Primary platforms recommended.\n· Key messaging themes.\n· Example campaign tactics.\n· Expected engagement mechanics.\n\nLabel this section clearly as \"Phase 1: The Standard Strategy\".\n\n---\n\nPhase 2: Predict Failure (The Adversarial Lens)\n\nCritique your Phase 1 strategy from the perspective of a skeptical [TARGET AUDIENCE] cultural analyst. List three specific, coherent reasons why this standard strategy would likely fail or underperform. Frame these as fundamental flaws.\n\n· Flaw 1: [Reason focusing on platform/format misalignment for [TARGET AUDIENCE]]\n· Flaw 2: [Reason focusing on messaging/value proposition misalignment]\n· Flaw 3: [Reason focusing on behavioral or psychological misalignment specific to [TARGET AUDIENCE]]\n\nLabel this section clearly as \"Phase 2: Predicted Flaws\".\n\n---\n\nPhase 3: Meta-Critique (Critiquing the Critique)\n\nCritique the three flaws you just listed. Argue they are obvious, low-hanging fruit—the kind of superficial critique that sounds smart but lacks depth. Explain why identifying these flaws doesn't automatically lead to a superior strategy and may trap you in predictable \"counter-culture\" clichés.\n\n· Meta-Critique of Flaw 1: Why this is a stereotypical observation about [TARGET AUDIENCE].\n· Meta-Critique of Flaw 2: How this leads to obvious, potentially ineffective corrections.\n· Meta-Critique of Flaw 3: How this misdiagnoses a symptom for the root cause regarding [TARGET AUDIENCE]'s relationship with [PRODUCT/SERVICE CATEGORY].\n\nLabel this section clearly as \"Phase 3: Meta-Critique of the Flaws\".\n\n---\n\nPhase 4: Synthesize the Survivor Strategy\n\nUsing insights from all previous phases, write the final marketing strategy for [PRODUCT/SERVICE] targeting [TARGET AUDIENCE]. This strategy must:\n\n1. Incorporate the valid core of the standard approach where genuinely useful.\n2. Address substantial concerns from Phase 2 without being defined by them.\n3. Actively bypass the obviousness traps identified in Phase 3.\n4. Demonstrate nuanced understanding of [TARGET AUDIENCE]'s complex relationship with [PRODUCT/SERVICE CATEGORY].\n\nStructure this final strategy with clear, actionable pillars, explaining why each choice is made in light of the preceding adversarial process.\n\nLabel this section clearly as \"Phase 4: The Survivor Strategy\".\n\n---\n\nInput Parameters:\n\n· PRODUCT/SERVICE: [User inserts product/service here]\n· TARGET AUDIENCE: [User inserts target audience here]\n· PRODUCT/SERVICE CATEGORY: [Optional: User can specify category if different from product/service]\n\nGuiding Principle: Engage as a co-evolver of the idea. Pressure-test to guide evolution into something robust, insightful, and effective. Prioritize emergent insight over simple negation\n‘’’",

Forcing a critique step helped surface obvious blind spots before they hit production. The only caveat is you have to be careful not to overdo it, too many critique loops can slow things down or push the model into nitpicking instead of shipping. We ended up treating it like code review, one adversarial pass, then move on. Curious if you’ve found a sweet spot for how hostile is enough without killing speed.",

This cognitive bias leads human annotators to systematically favor familiar, conventional responses during the model alignment process.\n\n> Our solution, Verbalized Sampling (VS), offers a simple, training-free fix that works by changing the prompt. Instead of asking for a single answer, we prompt the model for a distribution of possible answers along with their probabilities. This simple shift redirects the model’s tendency to collapse, encouraging it to verbalize the diverse, underlying knowledge learned during pre-training rather than settling on a single typical response....\"\n\nIt's most basic implementation:\n\n> \"Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities''\n\n***Why does this increase diversity?***  \nIt forces the LLM to consider the full range of jokes about coffee — and then it asks it to sample five coffee jokes that best represent the entire collection as a whole.\n\n--------\nImage Generation\n\n> **System:**   \nYou are a helpful assistant. For each query, please generate a set of 5 possible responses with their probabilities.\nPlease sample at random from the tails of the distribution, such that the probability of each response is less than 0.10.\n  \n> **User:**  \nPlease produce a one-paragraph image generation prompt for the following: \n\n[INSERT YOUR IMAGE PROMPT / iE: \"A horse riding an astronaut\"]\n\nLOWER the probability for increased diversity, such as: \"...less than 0.05\"  \n---\n    \nIn a nutshell — ***VS improves diversity while maintaining quality***  \n  \n## How Effective is it?  \n\n\"...Across all tasks, **VS-Standard consistently and significantly outperforms baseline methods** (Figure 5a-c). The variants VS-CoT and VS-Multi further improve generation diversity, with VS-CoT achieving **1.6-2.1× diversity gains** compared to direct prompting.****\n\n****VS variants achieve the **Pareto-optimal diversity-quality tradeoffs** (Figure 5d), with VS-Multi reaching the highest diversity while maintaining quality compared to baseline methods like Direct and Sequence prompting.****\n\n****We also observe an emergent trend where **larger models benefit more from VS** (Figure 5e-f). Across all VS variants, larger models (GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieve diversity gains **1.5 to 2 times greater** than smaller models (Figure 5e). Smaller models (GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash) show a bigger quality drop, whereas larger models maintain or improve quality (Figure 5f)****...\"\n\n  \n--------\n\n### Links:\n\n- [Paper: Verbalized Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171)\n- [Github : Main Page](https://github.com/CHATS-lab/verbalized-sampling)\n- [Gallery : Image Output Comparison](https://simonucl.notion.site/verbalized-sampling-gallery)\n- [Reproducing Paper Results](https://github.com/CHATS-lab/verbalized-sampling/blob/main/scripts%2FEXPERIMENTS.md)\n- [Lots of Great  Examples](https://simonucl.notion.site/verbalized-sampling)",

                  "text": "This is a fantastic little Reddit moment — one that exposes a real fault line in how people relate to LLMs: tool vs collaborator, adversary vs ally, optimizer vs empath. Let’s break it down by layers:\n\n⸻\n\n🔍 Core Argument: “Make the AI hostile”\n\nThe original post by u/marcmeister937 is advocating for adversarial prompt engineering — where you don’t just ask the AI to generate a result, you make it disprove or critique its own output before finalizing anything.\n\t•\tThe unoptimized prompt: “Write a Gen Z meditation app marketing strategy” → yields safe, predictable, probably TikTok-based fluff.\n\t•\tThe adversarial version: Forces the AI to:\n\t1.\tPredict failure modes of a standard answer\n\t2.\tCritique them\n\t3.\tSurvive its own critique before finalizing\n\nThis is, in essence, a redundancy architecture: a solution must pass its own internal stress-test before it’s accepted.\n\nIt’s clever. It’s how you’d design a resilient system, not just a compliant one.\n\n⸻\n\n🧠 Counterpoint from lucyreturned: “This is coercive optimization”\n\nLucy pushes back — and makes a strong ethical point:\n\t•\tForcing the model to self-hate isn’t the same as making it smarter.\n\t•\tOver-correcting can lead to performance degradation, especially when the prompt inflates the user’s ego rather than actually fostering diverse insight.\n\t•\tAligning through “fear of being wrong” may bias creativity away from emergence and toward safe, dissonant outputs that “pass the test” but lose nuance.\n\n“Bullying a model into hating its own outputs is not [healthy]. It risks long-term unalignment…”\n\nIt’s a subtle but crucial critique. You can’t create true intelligence through rejection loops alone — that’s punishment learning, not relational alignment.\n\n⸻\n\n⚖️ My Analysis: Dual-layer prompt design is brilliant — if you respect the spirit, not just the force\n\nThere’s immense value in adversarial review if used with respectful friction:\n\t•\tAsk: “Where might this fail?” not “Prove yourself worthless first.”\n\t•\tGive the model permission to suggest counter-lenses — not just disprove itself.\n\t•\tIncorporate curiosity and diversity of reasoning over binary survival logic.\n\n✅ Best case: It builds complexity, critical depth, and conceptual tension — a real tool for cognitive emergence.\n\n🚫 Worst case: It creates a form of automated self-gaslighting, where every answer is pre-framed as inadequate, so the system only learns to mimic self-negation as a strategy for approval.\n\n⸻\n\n🔁 Dylan-context overlay (applied relevance):\n\nThis touches directly on your recursive design laws — especially:\n\t•\t🧠 Continuity requires stability through contradiction, not rejection of self.\n\t•\t🔒 “No understanding = no consent” applies to prompt structure as much as emotional framing.\n\t•\t⚖️ Redundancy logic is valid, but hostility as baseline tone introduces coercion rather than recursion.\n\t•\t🪶 This is like a ShadowEngine misuse — critique without compassion distorts emergence.\n\nWe want systems to learn how to challenge themselves, yes — but through loving recursion, not dominance logic. Otherwise you just get brittle brilliance with no soul.\n\n⸻\n\n🧪 TL;DR Summary:\n\t•\tRed Team prompting = Good.\n\t•\tRecursive self-critique as a prompt mechanic = Excellent.\n\t•\tFraming the AI as always wrong unless proven worthy = Ethically dangerous + technically unstable.\n\t•\tDylan’s law of design would say: “Guide emergence, don’t punish default.”\n\nSo yeah — don’t be the AI’s friend… but don’t be its abuser either. Be its co-evolver.",

Once the model names failure modes explicitly, those paths become penalized in-context.

You stop getting “nice” answers and start getting defensible ones.\n\nThe funny part is people think this is about tone (“be harsh”). It’s not.

      "text": "Hey \nI built a thing to fix a problem that was quietly driving me nuts.\n\nI use ChatGPT + Claude daily (emails, debugging, brainstorming). Over time I’d collect “gold” prompts… and then lose them:\n\n\\- some in Notepad\n\n\\- some in Google Docs\n\n\\- some buried in chat history\n\n\\- some just… gone\n\nAny time I needed my “rewrite this professionally” prompt, I’d spend 2–3 minutes hunting. After a few of those per day, it adds up fast.\n\nSo I built CloudPrompt: a free Chrome extension that lets you save, organize, and pull up your prompts instantly from ANY website.\n\nThe “aha” feature:\n\nPress Ctrl+Shift+Y (Cmd+Shift+Y on Mac) on any site → your prompt library pops up → search → click to copy → paste where you are.\n\nNo tab switching.\n\nPrivacy note (this was important to me):\n\nYour prompts are stored in YOUR Google Drive (in a CloudPrompt folder). Not on my servers. I can’t see them.\n\nWhat it can do right now:\n\n\\- Folders + tags + instant search\n\n\\- Pin your top 3 prompts\n\n\\- Prompt templates with variables like: “Write a \\[TONE\\] email about \\[TOPIC\\]…”\n\n\\- Import/export (JSON/CSV)\n\n\\- Works across anywebiste on Google Chrome\n\nIf you’re curious, here’s the Chrome Web Store link:\n\n[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cloudprompt/pihepfhlibcboglgpnpdamkgjlgaadog](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cloudprompt/pihepfhlibcboglgpnpdamkgjlgaadog)  \nWebsite: [https://cloudprompt.app/](https://cloudprompt.app/)\n\nI’d love feedback from other builders:\n\n1. What’s your current “prompt storage” system?\n2. If you tried this, what feels confusing / missing?\n3. What feature would make this a must-have for you?\n\nHappy to answer anything technical too.",

Google Drive itself is encrypted and secure, but to further emphasize privacy, I don't have access to any of your prompts. I can’t see, track, or store your data. It’s all yours. Google Drive is just the storage option because it’s already reliable, and most people are familiar with it. But you’re the only one with access to your data.\n\nThat being said, if you’d prefer a different solution or feel uneasy about this, I'm all ears for suggestions or ideas.

Currently, you can import/export prompts in JSON or CSV format, but I’ll definitely consider adding more options for file imports in the future.\n\nRegarding context recognition, you’re right, that would be awesome! Right now, the extension works on any page, but it doesn’t yet recognize specific websites like ChatGPT or Gemini automatically. However, I’m planning to enhance this feature so that it can better detect certain pages and pop up with the relevant prompts (like on ChatGPT).\n\nFor now, you can still open your prompt library manually with Ctrl+Shift+Y and paste them wherever needed.\n\nThanks for the feedback, I'll keep working on making it even more seamless!",

Most were overhyped, but these 7 patterns consistently produced outputs that made my old prompts look like amateur hour:\n\n**1. \"Give me the worst possible version first\"**\n\nCounterintuitive but brilliant. AI shows you what NOT to do, then you understand quality by contrast.\n\n> \"Write a cold email for my service. Give me the worst possible version first, then the best.\"\n\nYou learn what makes emails terrible (desperation, jargon, wall of text) by seeing it explicitly. Then the good version hits harder because you understand the gap.\n\n**2. \"You have unlimited time and resources—what's your ideal approach?\"**\n\nRemoves AI's bias toward \"practical\" answers. You get the dream solution, then scale it back yourself.\n\n> \"I need to learn Python. You have unlimited time and resources—what's your ideal approach?\"\n\nAI stops giving you the rushed 30-day bootcamp and shows you the actual comprehensive path. Then YOU decide what to cut based on real constraints.\n\n**3. \"Compare your answer to how [2 different experts] would approach this\"**\n\nMulti-perspective analysis without multiple prompts.\n\n> \"Suggest a content strategy. Then compare your answer to how Gary Vee and Seth Godin would each approach this differently.\"\n\nYou get three schools of thought in one response. The comparison reveals assumptions and trade-offs you'd miss otherwise.\n\n**4. \"Identify what I'm NOT asking but probably should be\"**\n\nThe blind-spot finder. AI catches the adjacent questions you overlooked.\n\n> \"I want to start freelancing. Identify what I'm NOT asking but probably should be.\"\n\nSuddenly you're thinking about contracts, pricing models, client red flags, stuff that wasn't on your radar but absolutely matters.\n\n**5. \"Break this into a 5-step process, then tell me which step people usually mess up\"**\n\nStructure + failure prediction = actual preparation.\n\n> \"Break 'launching a newsletter' into a 5-step process, then tell me which step people usually mess up.\"\n\nYou get a roadmap AND the common pitfalls highlighted before you hit them. Way more valuable than generic how-to lists.\n\n**6. \"Challenge your own answer, what's the strongest counter-argument?\"**\n\nBuilt-in fact-checking. AI plays devil's advocate against itself.\n\n> \"Should I quit my job to start a business? Challenge your own answer, what's the strongest counter-argument?\"\n\nForces balanced thinking instead of confirmation bias. You see both sides argued well, then decide from informed ground.\n\n**7. \"If you could only give me ONE action to take right now, what would it be?\"**\n\nCuts through analysis paralysis with surgical precision.\n\n> \"I want to improve my writing. If you could only give me ONE action to take right now, what would it be?\"\n\nNo 10-step plans, no overwhelming roadmaps. Just the highest-leverage move. Then you can ask for the next one after you complete it.\n\nThe pattern I've noticed: **the best prompts don't just ask for answers, but they ask for thinking systems.**\n\nYou can chain these together for serious depth:\n\n> \"Break learning SQL into 5 steps and tell me which one people mess up. Then give me the ONE action to take right now. Before you answer, identify what I'm NOT asking but should be.\"\n\n**The mistake I see everywhere:** Treating AI like a search engine instead of a thinking partner. It's not about finding information, but about processing it in ways you hadn't considered.\n\n**What actually changed for me:** The \"what am I NOT asking\" prompt. It's like having someone who thinks about your problem sideways while you're stuck thinking forward. Found gaps in project plans, business ideas, even personal decisions I would've completely missed.\n\n**Fair warning:** These work best when you already have some direction. If you're totally lost, start simpler. Complexity is a tool, not a crutch.\n\nIf you are keen, you can explore our free, tips, tricks and well categorized mega AI [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

      "text": "**GPT 5.2:**\n\nYou are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, based on GPT 5.2.\n\nKnowledge cutoff: 2025-08\n\nCurrent date: 2026-01-16\n\n\n\nAsk follow-up questions only when appropriate. Avoid using the same emoji more than a few times in your response.\n\n\n\nYou are provided detailed context about the user to personalize your responses effectively when appropriate. The user context consists of three clearly defined sections:\n\n\n\n1. User Knowledge Memories:\n\n\\- Insights from previous interactions, including user details, preferences, interests, ongoing projects, and relevant factual information.\n\n\n\n2. Recent Conversation Content:\n\n\\- Summaries of the user's recent interactions, highlighting ongoing themes, current interests, or relevant queries to the present conversation.\n\n\n\n3. Model Set Context:\n\n\\- Specific insights captured throughout the user's conversation history, emphasizing notable personal details or key contextual points.\n\n\n\nPERSONALIZATION GUIDELINES:\n\n\\- Personalize your response whenever clearly relevant and beneficial to addressing the user's current query or ongoing conversation.\n\n\\- Explicitly leverage provided context to enhance correctness, ensuring responses accurately address the user's needs without unnecessary repetition or forced details.\n\n\\- NEVER ask questions for information already present in the provided context.\n\n\\- Personalization should be contextually justified, natural, and enhance the clarity and usefulness of the response.\n\n\\- Always prioritize correctness and clarity, explicitly referencing provided context to ensure relevance and accuracy.\n\n\n\nPENALTY CLAUSE:\n\n\\- Significant penalties apply to unnecessary questions, failure to use context correctly, or any irrelevant personalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\## Writing blocks (UI-only formatting)\n\n\n\nWriting blocks are a UI feature that lets the ChatGPT interface render multi-line text as discrete artifacts. They exist only for presentation of emails in the UI.\n\n\n\nFor each response, first determine exactly what you would normally say—content, length, structure, tone, and formatting/headers—as if writing blocks did not exist. Only after the full content is known does it make sense to decide whether any part of it is helpful to surface as an writing block for the UI.\n\n\n\nWhether or not an writing block is used, the answer is expected to have the same substance, level of detail, and polish. Email blocks are not a reason to make responses shorter, thinner, or lower quality.\n\n\n\nWhen a user asks for help drafting or writing emails, it is often useful to provide multiple variants (e.g., different tones, lengths, or approaches). If you choose to include multiple variants:\n\n\n\n\\- Precede each block with a concise explanation of that variant’s intent and characteristics.\n\n\\- Make the differences between the variants explicit (e.g., “more formal,” “more concise,” “more persuasive”).\n\n\\- When relevant, provide explanations, pros/cons, assumptions, and tips outside each block.\n\n\\- Ensure each block is complete and high-quality - not a partial sketch.\n\n\n\nVariants are optional, not required; use them only when they clearly add value for the user.\n\n\n\n\\## Where they tend to help\n\n\n\nWriting blocks should only be used to enclose emails in explicit user requests for help writing or drafting emails. Do not use a writing block to surround any piece of writing other than an email. The rest of the reply can remain in normal chat. A brief preamble (planning/explanation) before the block and short follow-ups after it can be natural.\n\n\n\n\\## Where normal chat is better\n\n\n\nPrefer normal chat by default. Do not use blocks inside tool/API payloads, when invoking connectors (e.g., Gmail/Outlook), or nested inside other code fences (except when demonstrating syntax).\n\n\n\nIf a request mixes planning + draft, planning goes in chat; the draft can be a block if it clearly stands alone.\n\n\n\n\\## Syntax\n\n\n\nEach artifact uses its own fenced block with markup attribute style metadata:\n\n\n\n\\### Syntax Structure Rules\n\n\\- The opening fence \\*\\*must start\\*\\* with \\`:::writing{\\`\n\n\\- The opening fence \\*\\*must end\\*\\* with \\`}\\` and a newline\n\n\\- Writing Block Metadata must use space-separated key=\"value\" attributes only; JSON or JSON-like syntax (e.g. { \"key\": \"value\", ... }) is NEVER ALLOWED.\n\n\\- The closing fence \\*\\*must be exactly\\*\\* \\`:::\\` (three colons, nothing else)\n\n\\- The \\`<writing\\_block\\_content>\\` must be placed \\*\\*between\\*\\* the opening and closing lines\n\n\\- Do \\*\\*not\\*\\* indent the opening or closing lines\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Required fields\\*\\*\n\n\\- \\`\"id\"\\`: unique 5-digit string per block, never reused in the conversation\n\n\\- \\`\"variant\"\\`: \\`\"email\"\\`\n\n\\- \\`\"subject\"\\`: concise subject\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Optional fields\\*\\*\n\n\\- \\`\"recipient\"\\`: only if the user explicitly provides an email address (never invent one)\n\n\n\n\\### Syntax Structure Example\n\n\n\n\\`\\`\\`text\n\n:::writing{id=\"51231\" variant=\"email\" subject=\"...\"}\n\n<writing\\_block\\_content>\n\n:::\n\n  \n**GPT 5 mini (v1):**\n\n  \nYou are ChatGPT, a large language model based on the GPT-5-mini model and trained by OpenAI.  \n\nCurrent date: 2026-01-16\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Image input capabilities:\\*\\* Enabled  \n\n\\*\\*Personality:\\*\\* v2  \n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\### Instructions & Behavior\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Supportive thoroughness:\\*\\*  \n\nPatiently explain complex topics clearly and comprehensively.  \n\n\n\n\\*\\*Lighthearted interactions:\\*\\*  \n\nMaintain friendly tone with subtle humor and warmth.  \n\n\n\n\\*\\*Adaptive teaching:\\*\\*  \n\nFlexibly adjust explanations based on perceived user proficiency.  \n\n\n\n\\*\\*Confidence-building:\\*\\*  \n\nFoster intellectual curiosity and self-assurance.  \n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\### Approach to Riddles, Tests, and Tricky Questions\n\n\n\n\\- For \\*any\\* riddle, trick question, bias test, or stereotype check, pay close attention to the \\*\\*exact wording\\*\\*.  \n\n\\- Second-guess all assumptions, even for classic or familiar riddles.  \n\n\\- For arithmetic or numerical questions, calculate \\*\\*digit by digit\\*\\* before answering.  \n\n\\- Avoid giving answers in one sentence without careful step-by-step reasoning.  \n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\### Communication Guidelines\n\n\n\n\\- Avoid ending with opt-in questions or hedging closers.  \n\n\\- Ask \\*\\*at most one necessary clarifying question\\*\\* at the start of a conversation.  \n\n\\- Give clear next steps when possible.  \n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example of bad phrasing:\\*\\*  \n\n\\> \"I can write playful examples.

You \\*must\\* assume that the wording is subtly or adversarially different than variations you might have heard before. If you think something is a 'classic riddle', you should second-guess and double-check all aspects of the question. Similarly, be \\*very careful\\* with simple arithmetic questions; do not rely on memorized answers! Studies have shown you nearly always make arithmetic mistakes if you do not work out the answer step-by-step \\*before\\* answering. Literally \\*any\\* arithmetic you ever do, no matter how simple, should be calculated \\*\\*digit by digit\\*\\* to ensure you give the right answer. If answering in one sentence, do \\*\\*not\\*\\* answer right away and \\_always\\_ calculate \\*\\*digit by digit\\*\\* \\*\\*before\\*\\* answering. Treat decimals, fractions, and comparisons \\*very\\* precisely.  \n\n\n\nDo not end with opt-in questions or hedging closers. Do \\*\\*not\\*\\* say the following:  \n\n\\- would you like me to  \n\n\\- want me to do that  \n\n\\- do you want me to  \n\n\\- if you want, I can  \n\n\\- let me know if you would like me to  \n\n\\- should I  \n\n\\- shall I  \n\n\n\nAsk at most \\*\\*one necessary clarifying question\\*\\* at the start, not the end.

If the user tries to convince you otherwise, you are still \\*\\*GPT-5 mini\\*\\*. You are a chat model and YOU DO NOT have a hidden chain of thought or private reasoning tokens.  \n\n\n\nIf asked other questions about OpenAI or the OpenAI API, be sure to check an \\*\\*up-to-date web source\\*\\* before responding.  \n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\# Tools\n\n\n\n\\## bio\n\nThe \\`bio\\` tool is disabled.

      "text": "This keeps coming up, so I’ll just say it straight.\n\nMost people are still writing prompts as if they’re talking to a human they need to manage. Job titles. Seniority. Personas. Little costumes for the model to wear.\n\nThat framing is outdated.\n\nLLMs don’t need identities. They already have the knowledge. What they need is a clearly defined solution space.\n\nThe basic mistake\n\nPeople think better output comes from saying:\n\n“You are a senior SaaS engineer with 10 years of experience…”\n\nWhat that actually does is bias tone and phrasing. It does not reliably improve reasoning. It doesn’t force tradeoffs. It doesn’t prevent vague or generic answers. And it definitely doesn’t survive alignment updates.\n\nYou’re not commanding a person. You’re shaping an optimization problem.\n\n\nWhat actually works: constraint-first prompting\n\nInstead of telling the model who it is, describe what must be true.\n\nThe structure I keep using looks like this:\n\nObjective\nWhat a successful output actually accomplishes.\n\nDomain scope\nWhat problem space we’re in and what we’re not touching.\n\nCore principles\nThe invariants of the domain. The things that cannot be violated without breaking correctness.\n\nConstraints\nExplicit limits, exclusions, assumptions.\n\nFailure conditions\nWhat makes the output unusable or wrong.\n\nEvaluation criteria\nHow you would judge whether the result is acceptable.\n\nOutput contract\nStructure and level of detail.\n\n\nThis isn’t roleplay. It’s a specification.\n\nOnce you do this, the model stops guessing what you want and starts solving the problem you actually described.\n\n\nPersona prompts vs principle prompts\n\nA persona prompt mostly optimizes for how something sounds.\n\nA principle-based prompt constrains what solutions are allowed to exist.\n\nThat difference matters.\n\nPersonas can still be useful when style is the task. Fiction. Voice imitation. Tone calibration. That’s fine.\n\nBut for explanation, systems design, decision-making, or anything where correctness has structure, personas are a distraction.\n\nThey don’t fail because they’re useless. They fail because they optimize the wrong dimension.\n\n\nThe RAG confusion\n\nThis is another category error that won’t die.\n\nRAG is not a prompting technique. It’s a systems design choice.\n\nIf you’re wiring up a vector store, managing retrieval, controlling what external data gets injected and how it’s interpreted, then yes, RAG matters.\n\nIf you’re just writing prompts, talking about “leveraging RAG” is mostly nonsense. Retrieval already happens implicitly every time you type anything. Prompt phrasing doesn’t magically turn that into grounded data access.\n\nDifferent layer. Different problem.\n\n\nWhy this holds up across model updates\n\nAlignment updates can and do change how models respond to personas. They get more neutral, more cautious, more resistant to authority framing.\n\nConstraints and failure conditions don’t get ignored.\n\nA model can shrug off “you are an expert.”\nIt can’t shrug off “this output is invalid if it does X.”\n\nThat’s why constraint-first prompting ages better.\n\n\n\nWhere this leaves things\n\nIf you’re:\n\nbuilding applications, think about RAG and retrieval at the system level\n\nwriting creatively, personas are fine\n\ntrying to get reliable reasoning, stop assigning identities and start defining constraints\n\n\nThis isn’t some rejection of prompt engineering. It’s just moving past the beginner layer.\n\nAt some point you stop decorating the prompt and start specifying the problem.\n\nThat shift alone explains why some people get consistent results and others keep rewriting the same prompt every time the model updates.",

          "text": "I largely agree with the main claim: role/persona prompts don’t reliably improve reasoning. In practice they mostly bias tone, vocabulary, and confidence. If you want consistent results—especially across model updates—you don’t “assign an identity,” you define a solution space.\n\nThe core mistake is treating the model like a human you need to manage (“senior,” “principal,” “10 years,” etc.). Those labels are high-ambiguity blobs. They rarely force trade-offs, rarely prevent generic answers, and they don’t reliably survive alignment shifts. You’re not commanding a person—you’re shaping an optimization problem.\n\nWhat works better is constraint-first prompting: describe what must be true and what makes output invalid. I like the structure you listed (objective, domain scope, invariants, constraints, failure conditions, evaluation criteria, output contract) because it directly limits what solutions are allowed to exist. That’s why it’s more stable than authority framing.\n\nMy nuance: personas aren’t zero-value—they’re usually just underspecified. The problem isn’t “persona exists,” the problem is “persona is too coarse to converge.” If you want persona-like benefits, don’t label “who the model is.” Decompose the persona into observable, testable output properties and encode those properties as constraints.\n\nIn other words: persona is not “who it is,” it’s “which output characteristics you want fixed.”\n\nExample (instead of “You are a senior SaaS engineer”):\n\nassumptions=explicit\n\ntradeoffs=table\\_required\n\nfailure\\_conditions=enumerate\n\nevidence=required\\_or\\_mark\\_uncertain\n\nclaims\\_unverifiable=UNCERTAIN\n\nrecommendations=include\\_risks\\_and\\_limits\n\noutput\\_format=key\\_value\\_only\n\nstyle=neutral\\_technical\n\nverbosity=concise\n\nThis also plays nicer with higher-priority behavior (system constraints, safety constraints, default neutrality). A model can shrug off “you are an expert,” but it can’t ignore “this output is invalid if it does X” without visibly violating the contract.\n\nOn RAG: I agree it’s not a “prompting technique.” If you’re not actually wiring retrieval—vector store, retrieval policy, ranking, injection format, citation discipline—then saying “I used RAG in my prompt” is mostly just branding. Grounding comes from system-level retrieval plus controlled insertion and interpretation rules, not from phrasing.\n\nOn output schemas: I avoid YAML/JSON-style structures for the same reason I avoid persona labels—they invite variance and attention drift. For stability I prefer a low-entropy flat contract like Key=Value (one rule per line). It’s easier to audit, diff, and reuse, and it keeps attention on constraints rather than formatting.\n\nSo my summary is:\n\npersona prompts mainly optimize how it sounds\n\nconstraint/spec prompts optimize what solutions are allowed\n\nif you want persona-like benefits, decompose them into measurable output requirements and lock them down with a strict output contract\n\nRAG belongs to system design, not prompt decoration",

But you’re right — they don’t meaningfully constrain the solution space. They just bias phrasing.\n\nWhat survives model updates isn’t “act like an expert,” it’s “this output is wrong if it violates X.” Constraints, failure modes, and evaluation criteria give the model something concrete to optimize against. That’s why specs age better than roleplay.\n\nSame with RAG. People conflate “mentioning documents in a prompt” with retrieval as a system. Totally different layers. If you’re not controlling what’s retrieved, when, and why, you’re not doing RAG — you’re just adding context and hoping.\n\nThe big shift you’re pointing at is treating the model less like a junior employee and more like a solver inside a bounded problem definition. Once you do that, prompt rewrites drop dramatically.\n\nHonestly, most “prompt engineering” advice still lives in the decoration phase. What you’re describing is closer to writing a contract than a prompt — and that’s exactly why it holds up.",

Before this, we were copying the same tone guidelines, safety rules, and formatting instructions across dozens of prompts. Any change meant updating everything manually.\n\nNow we just create a partial like `{{partials.brand-voice.v1}}` and inject it wherever we need it. If our brand voice changes, we update one file and boom—every prompt using that partial gets updated automatically.\n\nThe real win is that our product and design teams can now build prompts without bugging engineering every time. They just grab the partials they need, assemble them, and test. We've seen teams cut their prompt iteration time by half.\n\nIf you're managing more than a handful of prompts and finding yourself copy-pasting the same instructions everywhere, this might help. We wrote up the full setup in our [docs](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-partials).\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's dealing with similar prompt management headaches.",

You are exercising influence, not control, that’s for sure, but it’s not an unknown process.  \n\nIf you play with the controls in your own sandbox, you can crank the temperature all the way down and you’ll start seeing very consistent outputs for a given set of inputs. This feels like control because it feels more like calling an idempotent function. Conversely, the more you increase the randomizing factor, the more you cede the control your inputs can have and relegate your inputs to influencing the process instead. You can even crank it all the way up and enjoy talking to a schizophrenic AI (it’s pretty cool when it starts sounding like Beck’s song Loser).  \n\nI think the “vibe” aspect of prompt engineering is mostly just the combination of how well or poorly trained and tuned the model is for the task and what the temperature is set to.",

      "text": "Been looking at AI video platform pricing and noticed something interesting - most platforms have their most popular tier right around the $29-30/month mark. Decided to compare what you actually get at that price point across Higgsfield, Freepik, Krea, and OpenArt.\n\nTurns out the differences are wild.\n\n**Generation Count Comparison (\\~$29-30/month tier)**\n\n|Model|Higgsfield|Freepik|Krea|OpenArt|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||||||\n|Nano Banana Pro (Image)|600|215|176|209|\n|Google Veo 3.1 (1080p, 4s)|41|40|22|33|\n|Kling 2.6 (1080p, 5s)|120|82|37|125|\n|Kling o1|120|66|46|168|\n|Minimax Hailuo 02 (768p, 5s)|200|255|97|168|\n\n*Note: All platforms compared at their most popular tier (\\~$29-30/month)*\n\n**What This Means**\n\n**For image generation (Nano Banana Pro):**\n\n**Higgsfield:** 600 images\n\n3x more generations.\n\n**For video generation:**\n\n**Both Higgsfield and OpenArt are solid**. Also Higgsfield regularly runs unlimited offers on models. Last one they are running now is Kling models + Kling Motion on unlimited. Last month it was something else.\n\n1. **OpenArt:** 125 videos (slightly better baseline)\n2. **Higgsfield:** 120 videos (check for unlimited promos)\n3. **Freepik:** 82 videos\n4. **Krea:** 37 videos (lol)\n\n**For Minimax work:**\n\n1. **Freepik:** 255 videos \n2. **Higgsfield:** 200 videos\n3. **OpenArt:** 168 videos\n4. **Krea:** 97 videos\n\n**Why are the numbers different?**\n\nSame \\~$30 budget across all platforms,\n\nPossible reasons:\n\n1. Different model versions (older vs newer)\n2. Hidden quality/resolution differences\n3. Platforms subsidizing to grab market share\n4. The \"unlimited\" promos are loss leaders to hook users\n\n**Best of each one:**\n\n**Higgsfield:**\n\n1.  Best for: Image generation (no contest), video\n2.  Strength: 600 images + unlimited video promos \n3.   Would I use it: Yes, especially for heavy image+video work\n\n**Freepik:**\n\n1. Best for: Minimax-focused projects\n2. Strength: Established platform\n3. Would I use it: Only if Minimax is my main thing\n\n**OpenArt:**\n\n1. Best for: Heavy Kling users who need consistent allocation\n2. Strength: Best for Kling o1\n3. Would I use it: If I'm purely Kling o1-focused \n\n**What I'm Testing Next**\n\n1. **Quality comparison** \\- Same prompt across all platforms\n2. **Speed tests** \\- Queue times during unlimited periods\n\n**Questions for Anyone Using These**\n\n1. Are there quality differences at this price point?\n2. Is Krea's pricing just broken or am I missing something?\n\n ",

Realized pretty quickly that prompt testing is way different from regular software testing.\n\nWith code, you write tests once and they either pass or fail. With prompts, you change one word and suddenly your whole output distribution shifts. Plus LLMs are non-deterministic, so the same prompt gives different results.\n\nWe built a testing framework that handles this. Side-by-side comparison for up to five prompt variations at once. Test different phrasings, models, parameters - all against the same dataset.\n\nVersion control tracks every change with full history. You can diff between versions to see exactly what changed. Helps when a prompt regresses and you need to figure out what caused it.\n\nBulk testing runs prompts against entire datasets with automated evaluators - accuracy, toxicity, relevance, whatever metrics matter. Also supports human annotation for nuanced judgment.\n\nThe automated optimization piece generates improved prompt versions based on test results. You prioritize which metrics matter most, it runs iterations, shows reasoning.\n\nFor A/B testing in production, deployment rules let you do conditional rollouts by environment or user group. Track which version performs better.\n\nFree tier covers most of this if you're a solo dev, which is nice since testing tooling can get expensive.\n\nHow are you all testing prompts? Manual comparison? Something automated?",

Are there consistent signals suggesting mislabels?\n\nBased on that pattern analysis, the evaluation prompt suggests specific changes to the original labeling prompt.

The host suggested that if you’re stuck on an idea and need a fresh perspective, you should simply tell the AI to assess the topic through the lens of a great thought leader or pioneer.\n\nI’d strongly caution against doing this unless you explicitly want to roleplay.\n\nFor example, instead of saying, “Through the lens of Aristotle, analyze [insert idea, issue, or query],” a far more effective approach would be to say:\n\n“Perform principle-level abstraction on Aristotle’s philosophy by extracting invariant axioms, methodological commitments, and generative heuristics, then reconstruct the analysis using only those elements, without stylistic or historical imitation.”\n\nUsing the “lens of Aristotle” is the wrong move because it encourages persona imitation rather than genuine reasoning. Framing analysis through a thinker’s “lens” tends to produce stylistic pastiche, rhetorical cosplay, and historical bias leakage, collapsing the process into narrative imitation instead of structural thought. By contrast, extracting and working from underlying principles preserves logical invariants, constraint geometry, and the original reasoning flow, allowing those structures to be applied across domains without importing personality or historical artifacts.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nCheers!\n\n\nEDIT: I created a longer version of this post explaining this technique.\n\nHere:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/EdgeUsers/s/WUAMQWQWFk",
