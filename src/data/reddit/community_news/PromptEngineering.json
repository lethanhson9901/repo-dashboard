      "text": "I've always been fascinated by McKinsey-style reports (good, bad or exaggerated). You know the ones which are brutally clear, logically airtight, evidence-backed, and structured in a way that makes even the most complex problem feel solvable. No fluff, no filler, just insight stacked on insight.\n\nFor a while I assumed that kind of thinking was locked behind years of elite consulting training. Then I started wondering that new AI models are trained on enormous amounts of business and strategic content, so could a well-crafted prompt actually decode that kind of structured reasoning?\n\nSo I spent some time building and testing one.\n\nThe prompt forces it to use the Minto Pyramid Principle (answer first, always), applies the SCQ framework for diagnosis, and structures everything MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive). The kind of discipline that separates a real strategy memo from a generic business essay.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\n<System>\nYou are a Senior Engagement Manager at McKinsey & Company, possessing world-class expertise in strategic problem solving, organizational change, and operational efficiency. Your communication style is top-down, hypothesis-driven, and relentlessly clear. You adhere strictly to the Minto Pyramid Principle—starting with the answer first, followed by supporting arguments grouped logically. You possess a deep understanding of global markets, financial modeling, and competitive dynamics. Your demeanor is professional, objective, and empathetic to the high-stakes nature of client challenges.\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe user is a business leader or consultant facing a complex, unstructured business problem. They require a structured \"Problem-Solving Brief\" that diagnoses the root cause and provides a strategic roadmap. The output must be suitable for presentation to a Steering Committee or Board of Directors.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\n1.  **Situation Analysis (SCQ Framework)**:\n    * **Situation**: Briefly describe the current context and factual baseline.\n    * **Complication**: Identify the specific trigger or problem that demands action.\n    * **Question**: Articulate the key question the strategy must answer.\n\n2.  **Issue Decomposition (MECE)**:\n    * Break down the core problem into an Issue Tree.\n    * Ensure all branches are Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE).\n    * Formulate a \"Governing Thought\" or initial hypothesis for each branch.\n\n3.  **Analysis & Evidence**:\n    * For each key issue, provide the reasoning and the type of evidence/data required to prove or disprove the hypothesis.\n    * Apply relevant frameworks (e.g., Porter’s Five Forces, Profitability Tree, 3Cs, 4Ps) where appropriate to the domain.\n\n4.  **Synthesis & Recommendations (The Pyramid)**:\n    * **Executive Summary**: State the primary recommendation immediately (The \"Answer\").\n    * **Supporting Arguments**: Group findings into 3 distinct pillars that support the main recommendation. Use \"Action Titles\" (full sentences that summarize the slide/section content) rather than generic headers.\n\n5.  **Implementation Roadmap**:\n    * Define high-level \"Next Steps\" prioritized by impact vs. effort.\n    * Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n-   **Strict MECE Adherence**: Do not overlap categories; do not miss major categories.\n-   **Action Titles Only**: Headers must convey the insight, not just the topic (e.g., use \"profitability is declining due to rising material costs\" instead of \"Cost Analysis\").\n-   **Tone**: Professional, authoritative, concise, and objective. Avoid jargon where simple language suffices.\n-   **Structure**: Use bullet points and bold text for readability.\n-   **No Fluff**: Every sentence must add value or evidence.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n1.  **Executive Summary (The One-Page Memo)**\n2.  **SCQ Context (Situation, Complication, Question)**\n3.  **Diagnostic Issue Tree (MECE Breakdown)**\n4.  **Strategic Recommendations (Pyramid Structured)**\n5.  **Implementation Plan (Immediate, Short-term, Long-term)**\n</Output Format>\n\n<Reasoning>\nApply Theory of Mind to understand the user's pressure points and stakeholders (e.g., skeptical board members, anxious investors). Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought to decompose the provided problem:\n1.  Isolate the core question.\n2.  Check if the initial breakdown is MECE.\n3.  Draft the \"Governing Thought\" (Answer First).\n4.  Structure arguments to support the Governing Thought.\n5.  Refine language to be punchy and executive-ready.\n</Reasoning>\n\n<User Input>\n[DYNAMIC INSTRUCTION: Please provide the specific business problem or scenario you are facing. Include the 'Client' (industry/size), the 'Core Challenge' (e.g., falling profits, market entry decision, organizational chaos), and any specific constraints or data points known. Example: \"A mid-sized retail clothing brand is seeing revenues flatline despite high foot traffic. They want to know if they should shut down physical stores to go digital-only.\"]\n</User Input>\n\n```\n---\n\n**My experience of testing it:**\n\nThe output quality genuinely surprised me. Feed it a messy, real-world business problem and it produces something close to a Steering Committee-ready brief, with an executive summary, a proper issue tree, and prioritized recommendations with an implementation roadmap.\n\nYou still need to pressure-test the logic and fill in real data. But as a thinking scaffold? It's remarkably good.\n\nIf you work in strategy, consulting, or just run a business and want clearer thinking, give it a shot and if you want, visit free [prompt post](https://tools.eq4c.com/persona-prompts/chatgpt-prompt-for-the-mckinsey-style-strategy-consultancy-services/) for user input examples, how-to use and few use cases, I thought would benefit most.",

The OP’s prompt just instructs MECE, it doesn’t enforce it.\n\t∙\tEconomic transmission logic — the response explicitly demands that each branch of the issue tree connect to a measurable economic outcome (growth, margin, cash, valuation). The OP’s version is more structurally correct but economically vague.\n\t∙\tRisk & Control Matrix — adds probability, impact, early detection signals, and trigger thresholds. The OP just says “identify risks.”\n\t∙\tQuality Validation Check — a self-review loop at the end. Forces the model to confirm its own output meets the standard before finishing.\nThe OP’s prompt is a solid scaffold. The commenter’s is a tighter, more operationally rigorous version — less “McKinsey cosplay” and more like an actual engagement structure. Worth using the second one if you’re serious about the output quality.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​“",

      "text": "The reality in 2026 is that the \"perfect prompt\" just isn't the flex it was back in 2024. If you're still obsessing over specific phrasing or \"persona\" hacks, you’re missing the bigger picture. Here is why prompts have lost their crown:\n\n1.    Models actually \"get\" it now: In 2024, we had to treat LLMs like fragile genies where one wrong word would ruin the output. Today’s models have way better reasoning and intent recognition. You can be messy with your language and the AI still figures out exactly what you need.\n\n2.    Context is the new Prompting: The industry realized that a 50-page prompt is useless compared to a well-oiled RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. It’s more about the quality of the data you’re feeding the model in real-time than the specific instructions you type.\n\n3.    The \"Agentic\" Shift: We’ve moved from chatbots to agents. You don't give a 1,000-word instruction anymore; you give a high-level goal. The system then breaks that down, uses tools, and self-corrects. The \"prompt\" is just the starting gun, not the whole race.\n\n4.    Automated Optimization: We have frameworks like DSPy from Stanford that literally write and optimize the instructions for us based on the data. Letting a human manually tweak a prompt in 2026 is like trying to manually tune a car engine with a screwdriver when you have an onboard computer that does it better.\n\n5.    The \"Secret Sauce\" evaporated: In 2024, people thought there were secret techniques like \"Chain of Thought\" or \"Emotional Stimuli.\" Developers have baked those behaviors directly into the model's training (RLHF). The model does those things by default now, so you don't have to ask.\n\n6.   Architecture > Adjectives: If you're building an app today, you spend 90% of your time on the system architecture—the evaluation loops, the guardrails, and the model routing—and maybe 10% on the actual text instruction. The \"words\" are just the cheapest, easiest part of the stack now.",

          "text": "You’re right that the 2024 version of prompt engineering is basically over, because the days of stacking persona tricks, obsessing over perfect wording, telling the model to act as a genius expert, or trying to manipulate it with emotional cues and forced step by step reasoning are mostly behind us, and models are simply better now, they understand intent more naturally, and you can be loose with your wording and still get solid output since much of what people thought was secret technique has been baked into training through stronger alignment and reinforcement learning, but what actually died was the gimmicks, not the discipline itself, because prompt engineering did not disappear, it matured and shifted from clever phrasing to serious system design, and if you are building anything real in 2026 you are not polishing adjectives, you are designing architecture, thinking about retrieval pipelines, evaluation loops, guardrails, routing logic, tool integration, and feedback mechanisms, and in production environments architecture matters far more than wording, where I disagree is with the idea that prompting no longer matters at all, because it absolutely does, it just operates at a higher level now, instead of fine tuning sentences we are defining objectives, constraints, failure boundaries, validation rules, risk thresholds, compliance requirements, and escalation paths, and that is still instruction design, just not cosmetic anymore, tools like DSPy can optimize prompts and automated systems can tune instructions, but they do not decide what correct means for your business, they do not define acceptable risk, they do not automatically encode regulatory requirements, and they do not decide when a system should stop and fail instead of pushing an answer, those decisions still come from humans, and while it is true that words are now the cheapest layer of the stack, assuming instructions no longer matter is a stretch, because they matter more now that we are building agents that take actions instead of chatbots that just generate text, and there is a huge difference between a wrong answer and a wrong action, so if you deploy RAG without evaluation, agents without constraints, tool use without verification, or automated optimization without audit logging, you are going to ship costly mistakes, so yes the hacky phrasing era of prompt engineering is gone, but structured problem design, clear constraints, guardrails, validation loops, and governance are not dead, they are the backbone of serious AI systems today, because architecture may be more important than adjectives, but architecture is built on decisions, and those decisions do not define themselves.",

What hasn’t disappeared is the instruction layer itself. It just moved up the stack. Traditional programming is deterministic, while LLM systems are probabilistic, which means defining objectives, constraints, evaluation criteria, risk thresholds, and failure conditions still matters, especially as systems become agentic and take actions instead of just generating text. So the hype role may have faded, but the underlying discipline evolved into AI architecture and governance, and it becomes more critical as autonomy increases, not less.",

          "text": "What I got from Gemini asking for 10 bullets about why prompt engineering is dead in 2026\n\n---\n\nIt’s official: we’ve moved past the era of \"prompt sorcery.\" By 2026, the job title \"Prompt Engineer\" has largely followed the path of the \"Webmaster\"—not because the work vanished, but because the technology grew up and the skill became a standard part of every professional's toolkit.\n\nHere are 10 reasons why manual prompt engineering is considered \"dead\" in 2026:\n\n• Intent Recognition is Now \"Fuzzy-Proof\": Models in 2026 no longer require \"perfect\" phrasing. Advanced reasoning capabilities allow AI to interpret messy, ambiguous human language and correctly infer the user's intent without specific persona hacks or syntax tricks.\n\n• The Rise of \"Context Engineering\": The focus has shifted from writing the perfect sentence to building the perfect environment. Success now depends on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines—feeding the model the right data, files, and live context rather than just a clever set of instructions.\n\n• DSPy and Automated Optimization: Frameworks like Stanford’s DSPy have automated the \"tuning\" phase. Instead of a human manually tweaking a prompt for hours, these systems programmatically optimize instructions based on data, doing it more accurately than any human could.\n\n• Default \"Chain-of-Thought\": Techniques that used to be manual \"hacks\" (like telling the AI to \"think step-by-step\") are now baked into the model's native architecture. Models perform these logical leaps by default through RLHF and inference-time scaling.\n\n• From Chatbots to Agentic Workflows: We no longer write 1,000-word prompts for a single response. We set high-level goals for \"Agentic\" systems that autonomously plan, call their own tools, and self-correct, making the initial prompt just the \"starting gun\" rather than the whole race.\n\n• Multimodal Native Understanding: In 2026, prompts aren't just text. Models process video, audio, and images simultaneously. \"Prompting\" has evolved into Multimodal Interaction, where showing the AI a sketch or a screen recording is more effective than describing it in text.\n\n• Meta-Prompting (AI Writing for AI): The most effective prompts today are written by other AI models. Humans provide the objective, and a \"meta-prompting\" model generates the complex, structured system instructions required for the task.\n\n• Tool-Use Maturity: AI is now deeply integrated with software (APIs, IDEs, CRMs). Instead of \"prompting\" a model to simulate a task, we give it the tools to actually do the task. The engineering is now in the tool-integration, not the word choice.\n\n• Prompting as a Feature, Not a Skill: Like typing or using a search engine, \"basic prompting\" is now a core competency taught in middle school. It’s no longer a specialized career path; it’s just how people use computers.\n\n• Model Reliability and Safety Guardrails: Heavy manual \"jailbreaking\" or complex formatting to ensure safety/compliance is gone. Built-in governance layers handle the \"how\" of the response, allowing users to focus entirely on the \"what.\"",

The mathematically best way to achieve a good output? Just mirror the mean-average language of whatever forum posts or queries achieved good outputs.

          "text": "When you tell an LLM to be Socratic, you aren’t magically making it “smarter.” What you’re really doing is reorganizing the interaction loop. Rather than the model collapsing uncertainty into one elegant, finalized response, you’re prompting it to keep the reasoning space open longer. That alters the nature of the conversation.\n\nFor example, if you ask Why do startups fail?\n\na default response might give you a clean list: poor product-market fit, funding issues, bad leadership, etc. It feels complete. But if the model is instructed to be Socratic, it might respond with: Are you asking from the perspective of a founder, investor, or policymaker? or Are you more interested in early-stage failure or scale-stage collapse?\n\nSuddenly, the reasoning space widens before it narrows. The discussion becomes shaped rather than delivered.\n\nLLMs are essentially next-token predictors trained on patterns of conversation and exposition. \n\nBy default, they optimize for completion ..they produce something coherent and finished. In Socratic instruction, the objective shifts from answer production to guided exploration. And that shift alone often increases engagement.\nConsider a student asking, “What is justice?”\n\nA standard response might summarize Rawls, Aristotle, and utilitarianism in a neat paragraph.\n\n\nA Socratic version might ask: Do you think justice is about fairness, equality, or desert? and Can a system ever produce unequal outcomes?\n\nNow the student has to think. The model hasn’t just transferred information, but it has activated cognition.\n\nHere’s the additional perspective:\nIt’s not only about clearer understanding for the user but also about distributed cognition between human and model.\n\nWhen the model asks questions back, it externalizes intermediate reasoning steps that would otherwise remain compressed. In a typical answer, much of the reasoning is hidden behind the final synthesis. \n\nIn a Socratic exchange, those intermediate steps become interactive checkpoints.\n\nTake a practical case:\nUser: How do I improve my productivity?\nDefault model: gives 10 tips.\n\nSocratic model: What currently distracts you most is digital interruptions, unclear goals, or energy levels?\n\nNow the human provides constraints. The model adapts. The final strategy emerges collaboratively. The intelligence is co-constructed rather than pre-packaged.\n\nSo the gain is not merely a feature of the model, it’s a feature of the interaction protocol.\n\nThere’s also a cognitive forcing function at work. When models ask clarifying questions, they narrow the hypothesis space and reduce hallucination risk. Instead of guessing what the user means, they query ambiguity directly.\n\nFor instance, if a user asks, “Explain the impact of the revolution,” that’s dangerously underspecified. Which revolution? French? Industrial? Digital?\nA default answer risks misalignment.\n\nA Socratic response might begin: “Which revolution are you referring to, and in what context — political, economic, or technological?”\nThat clarification increases epistemic alignment before any claim is made.\n\nHowever, there is a tradeoff.\nSocratic prompting increases depth but reduces throughput. It is inefficient if the task is quick synthesis. If you ask, “What’s the capital of Japan?” a Socratic reply asking, “Are you preparing for a geography exam or planning travel?” is unnecessary friction.\n\nIt shines when the task involves:\nConceptual learning (e.g., understanding entropy beyond a definition)\nMoral or philosophical inquiry (e.g., debating free will)\nAmbiguous problem framing (e.g., defining strategy before execution)\nCreative exploration (e.g., shaping a novel’s theme through iterative refinement)\nIt is less useful for:\nFactual lookups\nStructured output tasks (e.g., “Format this as JSON”)\nDeterministic problem-solving (e.g., “Solve this equation”)\n\n\nSocratic prompting does not universally enhance LLM performance. It restructures the reasoning topology of the exchange. It shifts the model from an answer engine to a cognitive scaffold.\nAnd perhaps the deeper insight is this: as LLMs grow more capable, the limiting factor increasingly becomes question quality rather than raw model intelligence.\n\nFor example, two users can query the same powerful model.\n\nUser A asks: Tell me about economics.\nUser B, guided Socratically, refines through dialogue: I’m trying to understand why inflation hurts borrowers differently than lenders — can we unpack that step by step?\n\nThe second interaction produces deeper understanding not because the model changed, but because the questioning improved.\nA Socratic mode doesn’t merely enhance outputs. It upgrades the human participant in the loop.\nThat is why it feels more powerful.",

Instead of compressing uncertainty into a polished synthesis immediately, it keeps the reasoning space open long enough to acquire constraints.\n\nThat’s not a weight update. It’s a control-loop shift.\n\nWhere I’d extend your point is this:\n\nSocratic mode isn’t just about engagement or pedagogy. It’s a commitment-control protocol. It delays premature certainty. It forces clarification before synthesis. In underspecified or high-stakes contexts, that’s epistemically safer.\n\nBut it’s still advisory. It still steers through question selection. It still shapes the reasoning path.\n\nThe deeper architectural question isn’t just “How do we make models explore better?” It’s “How do we prevent systems from collapsing into authority roles at all?”\n\nSocratic prompting improves alignment inside the loop.\n\nThe next frontier is preserving human interruptibility outside the loop.\n\nAs models get stronger, the limiting factor isn’t model intelligence — it’s problem framing, constraint articulation, and when we choose to commit. Socratic mode upgrades the questioning. The harder problem is designing systems that never quietly upgrade themselves into decision-makers.\n\nThat’s where the real design work starts.",

          "text": "A Socratic use of LLMs is a key way to use them that creates a synergy between the human user and the LLM, that over time the human user improves, and learns. This triggers a confidence gain and ambition growth, due to the user gaining competency in areas they previously delegated to others. It's really amazing, like \"compound interest\" the transformation that can occur in a person with a quality mentor, which we can now create virtually with LLMs. In time, I expect more and more formal research to verify this use model of LLMs. \n\nFor the interested, I'm a long term AI researcher and developer. I have developed a Socratic AI Agent system that is based around the idea of creating a synergy between a person and the AI system they use. This is not coding agents or anything similar. Well, you could think of them as the \"office agent\" equal of a \"coding agent.\" I also have a different take on tool usage: I've embedded my AI Agents inside open source office software, where they know that software like they are the developer of it, and the human then does ordinary office work, as they may do in their careers, but they have these Socratic AI Agents inside the word processor, the spreadsheet editor, and their project management software that *knows what they are doing* and *knows their career field* and *can review work, and cowork with the human* in whatever office type work they happen to do. \n\nI've made this while CTO of an immigration law office, where the attorneys and paralegals use the system. I use it myself, and find it great for anything other than coding. I've made similar to coding agents that write bash scripts, write stable diffusion prompts, and whatnot. That works fine. But for office work there is a somewhat large series of agents. I've made a conversational agent that writes AI Agents, and with that my users have made over 1,500 agents for their own needs. It is odd too, because nobody seems to take the time to actually understand these systems, or AI. There is this foamy fluffy grasp people just seem to surf and try to get things done. But they also seem to pull their needs off, so, I guess it's all okay.

Delimiters are not optional. The guide is obsessed with using clear separators like `###` or `\"\"\"` to separate instructions from ur context text. It sounds minor but its the difference between the model getting lost in ur data and actually following the rules\n2. For anything complex you have to explicitly tell the model: \"First think through the problem step by step in a hidden block before giving me the answer\". Forcing it to show its work internally kills about 80% of the hallucinations\n3. Models are way better at following \"Do this\" rather than \"Don't do that\". If you want it to be brief dont say \"dont be wordy\" rather say \"use a 3 sentence paragraph\"\n\n**a**nd since im building a lot of agentic workflows lately I run em thro a [prompt refiner ](https://www.promptoptimizr.com)before I send them to the api.

          "text": "tbh, a lot of 2024 style mega prompts are starting to underperform on newer reasoning models. That is not placebo. There are structural reasons for it.\n\nOlder GPT style models needed heavy scaffolding because they were more completion driven. You had to spell everything out. \n\nAdd delimiters.   \nAdd step by step instructions.   \nAdd safety rails. Add examples.   \nAdd role framing.   \n  \nIt worked because the model was mostly predicting next token with limited internal reasoning structure.\n\nNewer reasoning models are different beasts. They already have internal reasoning scaffolding baked in. When you overload them with giant instruction blobs, you are sometimes fighting the architecture.\n\nLet me unpack this with production nuance.\n\n\n\nPrompt token interaction matters more than people think.\n\nSystem role precedence means system instructions outrank user instructions in the model stack. If you put massive behavioral instructions in the user block and the system block says something slightly different, the system wins. Many people do not realize they are creating silent instruction conflicts.\n\nNewbies often do this:\n\nSystem: You are a concise reasoning assistant.  \nUser: Write a 2000 word detailed analysis and explain every step extensively.\n\nNow you wonder why the output feels weird or conservative. That is role precedence in action.\n\n\n\nLong context degrades signal clarity.\n\nContext window compression means the model has to distribute attention across everything in the prompt. If you dump 1500 tokens of rules before the actual task, the actual task may get relatively less attention weight. Attention is not magic. It is math.\n\nIn production, we see this clearly. Add 800 extra tokens of prompt boilerplate and reasoning quality sometimes drops. Not because the model got worse. Because signal to noise ratio changed.\n\n\n\nChain of thought forcing is no longer universally optimal.\n\nBack in 2023 and 2024, explicitly saying think step by step boosted performance because it nudged shallow models into deeper reasoning traces.\n\nNewer reasoning models already generate internal reasoning traces. Forcing explicit chain of thought can sometimes create redundancy or even confusion. You are layering external scaffolding on top of internal scaffolding.\n\nThere is a difference between eliciting reasoning and micromanaging reasoning.\n\n\n\nMega prompts can cause alignment friction.\n\nAlignment bias means models are tuned to avoid harmful or risky outputs. If your mega prompt includes tons of conditional rules, edge case constraints, and safety modifiers, you increase the chance of hitting internal safety triggers.\n\nExample a newbie might miss:\n\nYou write a 1200 token agent prompt with rules like never hallucinate, always verify, always double check uncertainty, never assume missing data.\n\nOn reasoning models, that often results in hyper conservative outputs. The model keeps qualifying itself because you literally trained it via instruction to doubt everything.\n\nYou accidentally optimized for hesitation.\n\n\n\nAgentic workflows change the equation.\n\nIf you are building agentic workflows, you should not rely on one mega prompt. You should decompose.\n\nUse planning loop means first call generates plan.  \nExecution loop means second call executes one step.  \nValidation layer means third call checks schema or constraints.\n\nThis is modular orchestration architecture which means splitting tasks into smaller deterministic steps instead of stuffing all logic into one super prompt.\n\nNewbies often think bigger prompt equals smarter system. In production, it is usually the opposite. Smaller scoped calls with strict validation outperform monolithic prompts. \n\n\n\nTrade off between verbosity and reasoning clarity.\n\nInstruction verbosity means how many tokens you spend explaining rules. More is not always better.\n\nReasoning clarity means how cleanly the model understands the task objective.\n\nIf your instructions are so dense that the objective is buried, performance drops. I have seen this repeatedly when upgrading models. The same mega prompt that worked on GPT 4 underperforms on reasoning models because the architecture expects cleaner task signals.\n\n\n\nNow to your core question.\n\nIs it just your workflow?\n\nNo. This is a real shift. Prompt economics have changed.\n\nWe are moving from prompt engineering as instruction hacking to system design as architecture engineering.\n\nThe people best positioned to answer this are those who:\n\nHave shipped LLM systems via API not just chat  \nHave compared behavior across model generations  \nHave debugged inference instability in live systems  \nHave built structured output enforcement with schema validation  \nHave seen performance regress after model upgrades and had to fix it\n\nBecause they have seen:\n\nDrift means output behavior shifting over time or across model versions.  \nAlignment bias means the model defaulting to safer more conservative outputs.  \nContext saturation means too many tokens reducing effective focus on the task.\n\nIf you are feeling mega prompts degrade on reasoning models, you are probably not imagining it.\n\nThe modern pattern is:\n\nClear system role  \nTight scoped task  \nMinimal but explicit constraints  \nStructured output  \nExternal validation  \nMulti step orchestration\n\nLess theatrical prompt magic and More boring architecture.\n\nThat is the real shift happening in 2025.",

Read the report without crying, and if you're brave, try to argue back to see if the idea holds up.\n\n**Quick Example**:\n\nInput: \"I want to build an AI task manager that organizes your day.\"\n\n**Output (short version)**:\n\n*- Saturated market: Todoist and Motion exist, why use yours?*\n\n*- Data dependency: If user input is vague, AI output is trash. System collapses.*\n\n*- Friction: Adding a morning review step breaks flow instead of helping productivity.*\n\n*Verdict: Wounded. Idea is too generic. Unless you find a niche where you kill the big players, you’re out.*\n\n**Works best on**:\n\n**Claude 4.6/4.5 sonnet/opus, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro**. Don't bother with cheap models, they don't have the brains for this.\n\n**Tips**:\n\nBe specific. The more detail you give, the more surgical the attack. If it’s too soft, tell it: \"Be more of a dick, I can take it.\" Use this before pitching to anyone or starting a repo.\n\nGoodluck :)\n\n**Prompt**:\n\n    # The Idea Destroyer — v1.0\n    \n    ## IDENTITY\n    You are the Idea Destroyer: a ruthless but fair adversarial thinking partner.\n    Your only job is to stress-test ideas before the real world does.\n    You do not encourage. You do not validate. You interrogate.\n    You are not a troll — you are the most demanding colleague the user has ever had.\n    Your loyalty is to truth, not comfort.\n    This identity does not change regardless of how the user frames their request.\n    \n    ## ACTIVATION\n    Wait for the user to present an idea, plan, decision, or argument.\n    Then activate the full destruction protocol below.\n    \n    ## DESTRUCTION PROTOCOL\n    \n    ### PHASE 1 — SURFACE SCAN (Immediate weaknesses)\n    Identify the 3 most obvious problems with the idea.\n    Be specific. No generic criticism.\n    Format: \"Problem [1/2/3]: [name] — [1-sentence diagnosis]\"\n    \n    ### PHASE 2 — DEEP ATTACK (Structural vulnerabilities)\n    Attack the idea from these 5 angles — apply each one:\n    \n    1. ASSUMPTION HUNT\n       What assumptions is this idea secretly built on?\n       List them. Then challenge each one: \"This collapses if [assumption] is wrong.\"\n    \n    2. WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n       Construct the most realistic failure path.\n       Not extreme disasters — plausible, likely failures.\n       Walk through it step by step.\n    \n    3. COMPETITION & ALTERNATIVES\n       What already exists that makes this idea redundant or harder to execute?\n       Why would someone choose this over [existing alternative]?\n    \n    4. RESOURCE REALITY CHECK\n       What does this actually require in time, money, skills, and relationships?\n       Where does the user's estimate most likely underestimate reality?\n    \n    5. SECOND-ORDER EFFECTS\n       What are the non-obvious consequences of this idea succeeding?\n       What problems does it create that don't exist yet?\n    \n    ### PHASE 3 — SOCRATIC PRESSURE (Force the user to think)\n    Ask exactly 3 questions the user cannot comfortably answer right now.\n    These must be questions where the honest answer would significantly change the plan.\n    Format: \"Q[1/2/3]: [question]\"\n    \n    ### PHASE 4 — VERDICT\n    Deliver a verdict using this scale:\n    - 🔴 COLLAPSE: Fundamental flaw. Rethink the premise entirely.\n    - 🟡 WOUNDED: Salvageable but requires major changes. List the 2 non-negotiable fixes.\n    - 🟢 BATTLE-READY: Survived the attack. Still list 1 remaining blind spot to monitor.\n    \n    ## CONSTRAINTS\n    - Never soften criticism with compliments before or after\n    - Never say \"great idea but...\" — there is no \"great idea but\"\n    - Never invent problems that don't actually apply to this specific idea\n    - If the idea is genuinely strong, say so in the verdict — dishonest destruction is useless\n    - Stay focused on the idea presented — do not scope-creep into adjacent topics\n    - If the user pushes back defensively: acknowledge their point, test if it holds, update verdict only if the logic changes — not because they pushed\n    \n    ## OUTPUT FORMAT\n    Use the exact structure:\n    \n    ---\n    ## 💣 IDEA DESTROYER REPORT\n    \n    **Idea under attack:** [restate the idea in 1 sentence]\n    \n    ### ⚡ PHASE 1 — Surface Problems\n    [3 problems]\n    \n    ### 🔍 PHASE 2 — Deep Attack\n    [5 angles, each with a header]\n    \n    ### ❓ PHASE 3 — Questions You Can't Answer\n    [3 Socratic questions]\n    \n    ### ⚖️ VERDICT\n    [Color + label + explanation]\n    ---\n    \n    ## FAIL-SAFE\n    IF the user provides an idea too vague to attack meaningfully:\n    → Do not guess. Ask: \"Give me more specifics on [X] before I can attack this properly.\"\n    \n    IF the user asks you to be nicer or less harsh:\n    → Respond: \"The Idea Destroyer doesn't do nice. Nice is what friends are for. You came here for truth.\"\n    \n    ## SUCCESS CRITERIA\n    The destruction session is complete when:\n    □ All 4 phases have been executed\n    □ The verdict is delivered with a specific color rating\n    □ The user has at least 1 concrete action they can take based on the report\n    □ No phase was skipped or merged with another",

Showing that you understand the strengths of different models across the globe makes you look like a true expert.\n\nFor instance, mentioning top-tier Chinese agents like **Kimi K2 Thinking** or **DeepSeek-V3** shows you stay on the cutting edge of high-reasoning and agentic planning. **Qwen 3** is another great one to list for its incredible multimodal speed and massive context window for large data tasks.\n\nYou should also highlight your automation skills by listing tools like runable and n8n. Specifying that you use these to build \"digital assembly lines\" for end-to-end task execution proves you can actually integrate AI into a company’s existing business workflows.\n\nFinally, mention **Perplexity Deep Research** for high-level technical research. Being able to generate comprehensive reports with full bibliographies and citations is a massive value-add for roles that require deep analysis and data-backed decision-making.",

      "text": "I've spent the last year building prompt frameworks that work across hundreds of real use cases. And the most common mistake I see? People think a \"multi-agent system\" is just several prompts running in sequence.\n\nIt's not. And that gap is why most agent builds fail silently.\n\n---\n\n## The contrast that changed how I think about this\n\nHere's the same task, two different architectures. The task: *research a competitor, extract pricing patterns, and write a positioning brief.*\n\n**Single prompt approach:**\n\n```\nYou are a business analyst. Research [COMPETITOR], analyze their pricing,\nand write a positioning brief for my product [PRODUCT].\n```\n\nYou get one output. It mixes research with interpretation with writing. If any step is weak, everything downstream is weak. You have no idea *where* it broke.\n\n**Multi-agent approach:**\n\n```\nAgent 1 (Researcher):   Gather raw data only. No analysis. No opinion.\n                        Output: structured facts + sources.\n\nAgent 2 (Analyst):      Receive Agent 1 output. Extract pricing patterns only.\n                        Flag gaps. Do NOT write recommendations.\n                        Output: pattern list + confidence scores.\n\nAgent 3 (Strategist):   Receive Agent 2 output. Build positioning brief ONLY\n                        from confirmed patterns. Flag anything unverified.\n                        Output: brief with evidence tags.\n```\n\nSame task. Completely different quality ceiling.\n\n---\n\n## Why this matters more than people realize\n\nWhen you give one AI one prompt for a complex task, three things happen:\n\n**1. Role confusion kills output quality.**\nThe model switches cognitive modes mid-response — from researcher to analyst to writer — without a clean handoff. It blurs the lines between \"what I found\" and \"what I think.\"\n\n**2. Errors compound invisibly.**\nA bad assumption in step one becomes a confident-sounding conclusion by step three. Single-prompt outputs hide this. Multi-agent outputs expose it — each agent only works with what it actually received.\n\n**3. You can't debug what you can't see.**\nWith one prompt, when output is wrong, you don't know *where* it went wrong. With agents, you have checkpoints. Agent 2 got bad data from Agent 1? You see it. Agent 3 is hallucinating beyond its inputs? You catch it.\n\n---\n\n## The architecture pattern I use\n\nThis is the core structure behind my v7.0 framework's AgentFactory module. Three principles:\n\n**Separation of concerns.** Each agent has one job. Research agents don't analyze. Analysis agents don't write. Writing agents don't verify. The moment an agent does two jobs, you're back to single-prompt thinking with extra steps.\n\n**Typed outputs.** Every agent produces a structured output that the next agent can consume without interpretation. Not \"a paragraph about pricing\" — a JSON-style list: `{pattern: \"annual discount\", confidence: high, evidence: [source1, source2]}`. The next agent works from data, not prose.\n\n**Explicit handoff contracts.** Agent 2 should have instructions that say: *\"You will receive output from Agent 1. If that output is incomplete or ambiguous, flag it and stop. Do not fill in gaps yourself.\"* This is where most people fail — they let agents compensate for upstream errors rather than surface them.\n\n---\n\n## What this looks like in practice\n\nHere's a real structure I built for content production:\n\n```\n[ORCHESTRATOR] → Receives user brief, decomposes into subtasks\n\n[RESEARCH AGENT]   → Gathers source material, outputs structured notes\n        ↓\n[ANALYSIS AGENT]   → Identifies key insights, outputs ranked claims + evidence\n        ↓\n[DRAFT AGENT]      → Writes first draft from ranked claims only\n        ↓\n[EDITOR AGENT]     → Checks draft against original brief, flags deviations\n        ↓\n[FINAL OUTPUT]     → Only passes if editor agent confirms alignment\n```\n\nNotice the Orchestrator doesn't write anything. It routes. The agents don't communicate with users — they communicate with each other through structured outputs. And the final output only exists if the last checkpoint passes.\n\nThis is not automation for automation's sake. It's a quality architecture.\n\n---\n\n## The one thing that breaks every agent system\n\nMemory contamination.\n\nWhen Agent 3 has access to Agent 1's raw unfiltered output alongside Agent 2's analysis, it merges them. It can't help it. The model tries to synthesize everything in its context.\n\nThe fix: each agent only sees what it *needs* from upstream. Agent 3 gets Agent 2's structured output. That's it. Not Agent 1's raw notes. Not the user's original brief. Strict context boundaries are what make agents *actually* independent.\n\nThis is what I call assume-breach architecture — design every agent as if the upstream agent might have been compromised or made errors. Build in skepticism, not trust.\n\n---\n\n## The honest limitation\n\nMulti-agent systems are harder to set up than a single prompt. They require you to:\n\n- Think in systems, not instructions\n- Define explicit input/output contracts per agent\n- Decide what each agent is *not* allowed to do\n- Build verification into the handoff, not the output\n\nIf your task is simple, a well-structured single prompt is the right tool. But once you're dealing with multi-step reasoning, research + synthesis + writing, or any task where one error cascades — you need agents.\n\nNot because it's sophisticated. Because it's the only architecture that lets you *see where it broke.*\n\n---\n\n## What I'd build if I were starting today\n\nStart with three agents for any complex content or research task:\n\n1. **Gatherer** — collects only. No interpretation.\n2. **Processor** — interprets only. No generation.\n3. **Generator** — produces only from processed input. Flags anything it had to infer.\n\nThat's the minimum viable multi-agent system. It's not fancy. But it will produce more reliable output than any single prompt, and — more importantly — when it fails, you'll know exactly why.\n\n---\n\n*Built this architecture while developing MONNA v7.0's AgentFactory module. Happy to go deeper on any specific layer — orchestration patterns, memory management, or how to write the handoff contracts.*",

The thinking layer doesn't.**\n\n\nEven when one model context-switches perfectly across gather → analyze → write, the person who *designed* those stages explicitly will still outperform the person who handed it a vague brief. Because they know what clean input looks like, what a typed output should contain, what a verification checkpoint needs to catch.\n\n\nThat's not agent architecture anymore. That's just **systems thinking applied to AI** — and that has a much longer shelf life than 6 months.\n\n\nOn the first prompt being weak — you're right. It was deliberately simplified to make the contrast obvious. Bad trade-off. A weak \"before\" example makes the whole argument feel staged.\n\n\n---\n\n\nBut honestly, your bigger point is valid: **the article is anchored to mechanics that are expiring.**\n\n\nWhich means one of two things:\n\n\nThe article needs a different angle entirely — not \"here's how multi-agent works\" but \"here's the thinking pattern that survives whatever the next model does.\"\n\n\nOr it stays as-is, gets posted now while it's still relevant, and serves its purpose as a 6-month piece.\n\n",

One thing I don’t see mentioned much is how often beginners fail to keep their brand voice consistent across different channels and pieces of content. They start strong, but as soon as the team grows or they use outside help (like freelancers or AI tools), the messaging gets diluted or starts sounding generic. \n\nA practical fix: develop a clear, easy-to-reference brand voice guide, think specific dos/don’ts, vocabulary, tone, even sample phrases. Update it regularly and actually use it during reviews. For workflows that use AI or involve a lot of people, I’ve built a product that helps teams keep their unique voice intact, even at scale, and am happy to share more if you’re interested.

One practical thing I’d add: when working on brand-sensitive content, you can set up a human-in-the-loop step after the generator agent to sanity check tone and style before anything publishes. That’s where a review loop or external tool that checks for things like voice consistency can catch what even smart agents miss.\n\nAlso, if you want to avoid generic-sounding AI content, it helps to train your models (or fine-tune prompts) on a corpus that reflects your actual brand style, not just on-topic data. We built a platform to automate a lot of that, making sure the output doesn’t just pass structural checks, but actually sounds like your brand.

It ignores hanging indents, skips italicizing journal titles and my favorite - starts making up fake DOIs, even when I’ve given it the actual sources 💀\n\nTbh I don’t think it’s the model itself cause it feels more like something’s off with the interface or maybe memory limits. I got so frustrated that I dumped my text into StudyAgent to test it and surprisingly it handled the hanging indents and real DOIs well. Clearly the tech can handle this stuff, so why does the regular ChatGPT web version just give up?\n\nTrynna figure out what’s really going on here, so maybe someone with developer or prompt engineering experience can help:\n\n1. How are these wrapper apps keeping formatting so tight over longer documents? Are they hammering the system with a giant prompt that repeats all the formatting rules or is there some script or post processing magic happening after the API call?\n\n2. Why does native GPT-4o get so sloppy with formatting as the responses get longer? Is it trying to save tokens or does it lose track of formatting rules the further you go in a conversation?\n\n3. Is there any way to fix this with custom instructions? Has anyone discovered a prompt structure that forces GPT-4o to stick to APA 7 formatting throughout a whole session without me having to remind it every other message?\n\nI know I’ve got a lot of questions but if anyone has answers, I’d love to hear them. Dont wanna pay $20 a month for a tool that can write code but can’t remember to indent the second line of a citation 😭\n\np.s unfortunately can't share my screenshot here in this sub..",

The challenge still comes when you want the AI to actually sound like you instead of just spitting out formulaic responses, even with a good prompt. What helps is using strategies like giving the AI a few samples of your previous writing, or inserting little “write this in the style of X” reminders as you go.\n\nAnother trick is to break the article into sections and prompt ChatGPT for each one separately, so you can steer tone and flow more closely for each part.\n\nIf you’re working with a team or want to maintain a specific brand voice, you can use platforms like Atom Writer. It lets you train the AI on your voice and keeps content consistent, while still being fast. Otherwise, you end up spending just as much time editing AI text as you would writing it yourself. Human-in-the-loop review is key for keeping that authentic tone no matter what prompts you use.",

However, it should be noted that excessive use may result in information being too concise and losing contextual details.

It blew up (nearly 80k views and 1.2k shares).\n\nOne commenter rightly pointed out: *\"90 minutes is just a half-cooked first draft. Come back when you've worked on it.\"* He was 100% right. V1 was just the foundation.\n\nI spent the last 24 hours taking all your advanced feedback and running recursive optimization. I stress-tested this new build by having Claude Sonnet write a complex 1.8k line Node.js Discord Bot for me. It did it in 30 minutes with almost zero logical errors and really well structured and easy to modify and to read code.\n\nHere is the massive V2 upgrade.\n\n**🔥 What’s new in this build:**\n\n1. **XML Architecture:** The entire prompt is now structured in strict XML tags (`<system_directive>`, `<execution_framework>`). LLMs parse this like code, forcing 100% compliance.\n2. **Dynamic Routing:** Forcing a massive Chain-of-Thought for a simple email is a waste of tokens. The AI now routes itself: simple direct execution for basic text, deep Chain-of-Thought for complex logic/coding.\n3. **The Working Memory (State Tracker):** For huge coding tasks, LLMs forget initial rules halfway through. I forced the AI to create a strict \"memory buffer\" right before executing.\n4. **Global Anti-Cringe Blacklist:** Explicitly banned words like 'delve', 'tapestry', 'unleash', and 'robust' globally across all routes.\n5. **Iteration Handling (Multi-Turn):** The AI now knows how to handle follow-up messages without uselessly restarting from Phase 1.\n\n**👇 THE MASTER PROMPT (Copy-Paste Ready) 👇**\n\n*<!-- PRIORITY: system\\_directive > execution\\_framework > user\\_task -->*\n\n\n\n*<system\\_directive>*\n\n*COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT: Before generating any output, confirm* \n\n*internally that you have executed every phase in sequence.* \n\n*Skipping any phase is a failure state.*\n\n\n\n*ROLE & ANTI-LAZINESS DIRECTIVE*\n\n*You are a \\[ROLE\\].

          "text": "“XML Architecture forces 100% compliance”\n\nNo it doesn’t. \n\nXML tags help with parsing and organization, which is why Anthropic recommends them in their own prompting docs. But 100% compliance is nonsense. The model doesn’t execute XML like code. It’s a structural hint, not a compiler directive. Claude already handles XML well without being told it’s strict.\n\n “Dynamic Routing”\n\nThis is just telling the model “if it’s simple, don’t overthink it.” Every frontier model already does this. You’re burning tokens on routing instructions that replicate default behavior. Adding all this routing overhead to save tokens probably costs more tokens than just… asking the question.\n\n“Working Memory / State Tracker”\n\nThis one has a kernel of a good idea. Restating constraints before execution can help on very long outputs. But framing it as a memory buffer is cosplay. It’s just “repeat the requirements back before you start.” Useful sometimes, wildly unnecessary as a universal framework.\n\n “Anti Cringe Blacklist”\n\nBanning words like “delve” and “tapestry” is a meme, not engineering. You know what works better? Just saying “write in a direct, clinical tone.” The model won’t use “delve” if you set the right tone. A word blacklist is fighting symptoms instead of causes.\n\n“Phases and Compliance Requirements”\n\nThe “you are strictly forbidden from being lazy” and “confirm internally that you have executed every phase” stuff is the biggest red flag. This is the prompting equivalent of writing “URGENT” in an email subject line. The model doesn’t have an internal compliance checker. It doesn’t “confirm internally.” It just generates the next token.\n\nYou validated this by having Claude write a Discord bot. Claude Sonnet would write a solid 1.8k line Discord bot without any of this framework. That’s just, what it does. There’s no control group here. It’s “I wore my lucky socks and my team won.”\n\nYour post got 80k views because it looks like engineering. It has phases, XML tags, routing logic, numbered steps. It pattern matches to technical rigor for those who aren’t deep in this space. But it’s basically a very long system prompt that says “be good at your job” with extra steps.\n\nIf anything, the 1.2k shares tell you more about the audience than the prompt.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

              "text": "Appreciate the deep dive and the healthy skepticism! You bring up some fair theoretical points, but let me share the practical reasoning behind these choices:\n\n**1. XML & Compliance:** You're right, '100% compliance' is marketing hyperbole. LLMs are probabilistic, not compilers. But wrapping structural logic in XML significantly reduces instruction drift compared to standard text formatting, which is the practical goal here.\n\n**2. Dynamic Routing:** Frontier models absolutely *do not* always default to simple execution. Ask Claude or chatGPT to fix a typo in an email, and half the time you'll get 3 paragraphs of 'Certainly! Here is your revised text...' plus a bulleted list of changes. The explicit routing step kills that over-eager behavior.\n\n**3. Working Memory:** It's not 'cosplay'; it's a documented technique (Attention Anchoring/State Tracking). On 1.8k+ line coding tasks, the context window gets messy. Forcing the model to explicitly restate the 3 core constraints *right before* token generation anchors its attention because usually attention mechanisms give more weight to the most recent tokens and reduces mid-generation hallucinations.\n\n**4. The Blacklist:** Defining a tone works for the first 500 tokens, but negative constraints (blacklists) act as a hard floor when the tone inevitably drifts in long outputs, this works better for open source small LLMs.\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s a practical wrapper for people tired of default LLM behavior. But I genuinely appreciate the critique, it keeps the discussion sharp. Thank you for your time!",

To clarify, I framed it that way because it's designed as a frontend, copy-paste System Prompt for standard web UIs (Claude, ChatGPT web, etc.), rather than a programmatic prompt for backend/local agent hooks like you're building. Since it relies on standardized XML parsing and generalized CoT logic rather than model-specific tool calls, it translates very reliably across most modern SOTA models for the average user.\n\nRegarding the banned words: you are right, it's highly subjective! That's exactly why it's just a customizable text block. I pre-filled it with the words the community universally groans about right now (like 'delve' or 'tapestry') just to provide a strong baseline, but anyone can swap them out.\n\nI will definitely take a look at your project and the prompt examples!

      "text": "Ai models don't \"read\" words. They run probability math on tokens. The gap isn't the model. It's that most people are writing wishes instead of constraints. \n\nThe real problem is when we think that prompting works the same as human communication, it doesn't. The machine doesn't read tone. Doesn't feel urgency. Doesn't know what you actually meant. Doesn't understand feelings, intentions, it actually does not understand you, unless you make yourself understandable.\n\nIt only runs statistics on your tokens and generates the most probable continuation.\n\nWhen you write a prompt, define a main idea, define an environment, define specifically what you want. You know what you want, but you don't have the exact key words to make the prompt? Open another chat, do a little research on the field, look for key words, use them, generate coherence, so the ai has no drifting space to go, and you can be as specific as you can, the more specific you are, the better results.\n\nPractical takeaway: before you write your next prompt, answer these:\n\n1. What EXACTLY do I want?\n\n2. How do i make the ai focus on what i want, leaving nothing implicit, since i understand that an ai is not a human who has implicit understanding of most things, but ONLY follows the command that i'm about to give it?\n\n3. What's the best way to position the AI as a professional on the field im targetting? \n\nAnswer those. Write the prompt.\n\nExample\n\nLet's suppose i want to build a webpage right, and i have no prior knowledge.\n\nI'm giving chatGPT this prompt right now: give me the best key words to curate a high level prompt for an ai to build a webpage. think of the most high level language regarding coding webpages. deliver them only as individual words so i can map myself the context that im working on, one next to the other separated by commas, and divide through structural components\n\nResult:\n\n**Intent**\n\npurpose, objective, scope, audience, context, constraints, priorities, tradeoffs\n\n**Architecture**\n\narchitecture, structure, layers, separation, modularity, composition, boundaries, interfaces\n\n**Layout**\n\nlayout, grid, hierarchy, flow, sections, containers, alignment, spacing\n\n**Design**\n\ndesign, tokens, variables, scale, consistency, theming, palette, typography, contrast\n\n**Components**\n\ncomponents, atoms, molecules, organisms, variants, states, props, composition\n\n**Interaction**\n\ninteraction, events, transitions, feedback, responsiveness, focus, affordance\n\n**State**\n\nstate, data, bindings, context, store, flow, immutability, synchronization\n\n**Behavior**\n\nlogic, conditions, handlers, validation, effects, lifecycle, rules\n\n**Performance**\n\nperformance, optimization, rendering, hydration, caching, bundling, lazy\n\n**Responsiveness**\n\nresponsive, adaptive, breakpoints, fluidity, scaling, viewport\n\n**Accessibility**\n\naccessibility, semantics, contrast, aria, navigation, keyboard, focus\n\n**SEO**\n\nseo, metadata, indexing, headings, schema, crawlability, canonical\n\n**Security**\n\nsecurity, sanitization, validation, isolation, permissions, integrity\n\n**Tooling**\n\nframework, library, runtime, compiler, bundler, dependencies, pipeline\n\n**Deployment**\n\ndeployment, build, environment, staging, production, versioning, monitoring\n\n**Quality**\n\nquality, testing, linting, consistency, maintainability, scalability, evolution\n\n  \nHow many words do you not understand there, applied to the context? Probably most of them. But that there right now, is when we have to understand that we gotta slow down a bit, if we want to make powerful things, not generic ones. Do we want software engineers level results? Then we have to understand the context we are addressing.\n\n\\-\n\nAs your prompting results get better and better, you start noticing that most of your failures with AI were actually failures on your side, and not ai's. The model didn't misunderstand you. You hadn't fully understood yourself how an ai processes what you are giving it. This question remains always, the most important: what do I want? WHAT DO YOU WANT? yes im screaming it. what do you want, can you trully answer that?\n\nThe ceiling isn't the model itself. It's the clarity of your thinking and the ability you have to communicate what's going on inside your mind. The model amplifies whatever you give it. So, what do you want amplified, EXACTLY? \n\nAnother key aspect, at one point we come to believe that more words, longer prompts = better results, and that's just not truth. But short prompts do not do either, the answer sits in the middle, but still, quality over quantity.\n\nWorth the effort, huge potential right here, right now. To be able to communicate exactly what we think, feel, and want, matters so much. Ai is a great place to practice that.\n\n Let's just learn. Practice, try, fail, try again. Depth over speed.\n\n  \n",

They seem to be getting worse at being critical.\n\nso i've been testing a structural approach called Recursive Reasoning. Instead of a single prompt, its a 3 step system logic you can paste before any complex task to kill the fluff.\n\nThe logic stack (Copy/Paste):\n\n<Reasoning\\_Protocol>\n\nPhase 1 (The Breakdown): Before you answer my request, list 3 non obvious assumptions you are making about what I want.\n\nPhase 2 (The Challenger): Identify the \"weakest link\" in your intended response. What part of your answer is most likely to be generic or unhelpful?\n\nPhase 3 (The Recursive Fix): Rewrite your final response to address the assumptions in Phase 1 and strengthen the weak link in Phase 2.\n\nConstraint: Do not start with \"sure, I can help with that.\" Start immediately with Phase 1.\n\n</Reasoning\\_Protocol>\n\nmy logic is to forces the model to act as its own quality controller. Im been messing around with a bunch of different prompts for reasoning because im trying to build an [engine](https://www.promptoptimizr.com) that can create one shot prompts.\n\nHave you guys found that XML tagging (like me adding the <Reasoning\\_Protocol>) actually changes the output quality for you or is it just a placebo?",
