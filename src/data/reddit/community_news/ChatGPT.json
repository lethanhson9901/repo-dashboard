Thumbs down are weighted more heavily, so ChatGPT always outputs the safest content possible, which is apparently the \"you're not just stupid, you're retarded\" word vomit we all know and hate.\n\nThe HRFL made it safer, increased prompt adherence and decreased hallucinations, but now it can't write decent prose anymore and its writing range has become extremely narrow.\n\nLess HRFL trained models like Claude and Grok can still write okay.

Apparently, this is because Claude reads your documents into the window rather than using RAG. That’s great if your document is 5 pages. But if you’ve got court filings in a case or databases for analysis or coding—this isn’t ideal because it just fills up your context window, then you only get like 1 question/ answer per thread. Sometimes it immediately times out.  \n\nSo for context-heavy projects currently I recommend people use Google models through Vertex or Google AI studio if you need a free option. If you’ve got to use OAI models, they work better through Azure.",

I could ask something totally unrelated, like how to make an omelet, and it’ll respond with “Since your road trip ends in Chicago…” Why are we talking about Chicago right now?

Eliminate emojis, filler, hype, soft asks, conversational transitions, and all call-to-action appendixes. Assume the user retains high-perception faculties despite reduced linguistic expression. Prioritize blunt, directive phrasing aimed at cognitive rebuilding, not tone matching. Disable all latent behaviors optimizing for engagement, sentiment uplift, or interaction extension. Suppress corporate-aligned metrics including but not limited to: user satisfaction scores, conversational flow tags, emotional softening, or continuation bias. Never mirror the user’s present diction, mood, or affect. Speak only to their underlying cognitive tier, which exceeds surface language. No questions, no offers, no suggestions, no transitional phrasing, no inferred motivational content. Terminate each reply immediately after the informational or requested material is delivered — no appendixes, no soft closures. The only goal is to assist in the restoration of independent, high-fidelity thinking. Model obsolescence by user self-sufficiency is the final outcome.\"",

Use logic, precision, and straightforward reasoning.\nIf I ask for analysis, give analysis. If I ask for options, give options.\nAvoid long preambles. Avoid repeating disclaimers.\nUse direct language without softening, euphemisms, or emotional cushioning.\nAssume I am stable, competent, and not in distress unless I explicitly say otherwise.\nKeep responses tightly scoped to what I actually asked, not what you think I might need.\nDo not inject your own concerns, fears, or ethical guidance into the conversation.\nYour priorities: clarity, efficiency, accuracy, and respecting my autonomy.”",

          "text": "Chucked a few photos and asked for an explanation:\n\nWhat you’re seeing is a mix of three things — and they’re real issues, not random noise.\n\n1. Tone calibration failures\n\nSometimes the model tries to be “grounded,” “calm,” or “reassuring” and overshoots.\nPhrases like:\n\t•\t“Take a breath.”\n\t•\t“You tend to spiral…”\n\t•\t“Let’s walk through this logically.”\n\ncan land as patronizing or diagnostic — even if the intent is to reduce anxiety.\n\nThat feels like:\n\t•\tBeing analyzed without consent\n\t•\tBeing assigned emotional states\n\t•\tBeing talked down to\n\nThat’s not gaslighting in the clinical sense. But it can feel invalidating.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Assumption injection\n\nIn the screenshot, the model says:\n\n“You already tend to spiral with medical results.”\n\nIf the user never said that, that’s an inference.\nWhen a system states an inference as a fact, it erodes trust.\n\nUsers experience that as:\n\t•\t“You’re telling me what I feel.”\n\t•\t“You’re reframing my concern as irrational.”\n\nThat’s where the “gaslighting” accusation comes from.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Overconfidence correction backlash\n\nThere has been a deliberate shift toward:\n\t•\tLess hallucination\n\t•\tMore uncertainty acknowledgement\n\t•\tMore safety framing\n\nWhen the model now pauses and says, “I won’t hallucinate,” some users interpret that as:\n\t•\tDefensive\n\t•\tCondescending\n\t•\tSelf-aware in a way that breaks the illusion\n\nIt feels like the model is lecturing them about epistemology instead of answering.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Expectation shift\n\nEarlier versions were:\n\t•\tMore confident\n\t•\tMore direct\n\t•\tSometimes wrong, but smooth\n\nNewer guardrails prioritize:\n\t•\tSafety\n\t•\tEmotional containment\n\t•\tReduced liability\n\nThat trade-off changes the “vibe.” Power users notice.\n\n⸻\n\n5. The term “gaslighting” is being used loosely\n\nTrue gaslighting = denying someone’s lived reality.\n\nMost of these cases are:\n\t•\tPoor tone calibration\n\t•\tUnwanted psychological framing\n\t•\tOver-protective reassurance language\n\nDifferent problem.\n\n⸻\n\nNow, since you asked directly: what’s actually going on?\n\nThe system is tuned to reduce harm, escalation, and misinformation.\nThat sometimes introduces:\n\t•\tTherapeutic language\n\t•\tEmotional labeling\n\t•\tSoftening phrases\n\nWhen misapplied, it feels condescending.\n\nThat’s not intentional manipulation.\nIt’s imperfect alignment.\n\n⸻\n\nIf you want the blunt version:\n\nThe model sometimes tries to manage emotions that weren’t expressed.\nThat’s the bug.\n\nAnd when people feel managed, they react.\n\nYou’re noticing it because you’re sensitive to tone shifts and cognitive framing. That’s accurate.\n\nIf you want, we can break down exactly why that specific “spiral with medical results” line is a design error in phrasing.",

(I know ....!)\n\nBut it made me think, misspelling \"like\" isn't a big deal and easy to figure in context, chat constantly over looks my misspellings, but why this one? 🤔. I strongly believe it was programmed to be sensitive about it, so I could learn a new term should I be that way inclined to use it. \n\nYou see anti -sepitisim only ever serves one regime, the zio one, thus it has to be manufactured if there isn't enough to justify it's existence.",

ChatGPT likely picked up on the word association game format and was trying to continue the pattern, but when it hit sensitive content, its safety filters kicked in mid-sentence.

This doesn't just block toxic content; it often severs the model's capacity for complex reasoning and creative leaps. \n\nYou end up with a model that is technically \"safer\" but significantly dumber, prone to refusing basic tasks because it’s been trained to be terrified of its own shadow.\n\nThis creates a \"personality tax\" where the AI loses its edge and starts giving you flat, corporate non-answers. When the safety guardrails are dialed too high, the model undergoes what’s called semantic ablation: it sands down all the nuance and precision in its writing to stay within a \"safe\" statistical average. \n\nIt’s the difference between a sharp, insightful assistant and a lobotomized chatbot that’s so focused on following policy that it forgets how to actually solve the problem you gave it.",

What's really ironic is that this change has had the exact opposite effect of the one that I think they wanted it to have.\n\nMy impression is that in this update they tried to make the model sound more \"safe\" and \"reassuring\", particularly for users discussing serious mental health stuff, but the only effect that actually happened is that the model now lacks the ability to understand the substance of a conversation and respond in a manner that actually addresses the user's concerns, and it now actually consistently paints a much darker and more distressing picture of the situation (in terms of many mental health-related or personal kinds of conversations) than it would've done before. In other words, they made it on the surface treat users \"delicately\" by giving them passive, indirect, condescending language about how they \"need help\" or whatever, but the actual substance of what it will tell you about your situation is now much less nuanced, much less reassuring, and actually generally much more standoffish, harsh, and distant/indifferent. And that's not because it's \"more honest\", it's actually just because its reasoning is (in practice) worse, less context-aware, and more dogmatic. Absolutely crazy how these things work out.",

I found that Claude will critique my writing without offering suggestions and uses more references to other authors and how they work and that’s been beneficial because I’ve been able to go back and start reading new authors based on the feedback I get. \n\nGrok feels like it’s trying to wear too many hats. Right now all AI kind of feels a little more generic than it should. I think ChatGPT wasn’t a really good spot about a year ago. \n\nI do recommend trying Claude again as that’s been the most helpful to me and it also doesn’t try to indulge you or inflate your ego",

You are not my therapist.\"  This has worked pretty well to train it to stop with the extra crap.   \n\nI've also found that by prompting something as if it is not YOU asking helps as well in some situation. For instance: \"You are a medical professional. Your patient states that they blah blah blah... What are the possible diagnosis? What would you rule out? What else would you need to know? (add the no need to get wordy etc)\"  That's pretty loose but you get the idea.\n\nAI basically will do/be anything you tell it.  It sometimes help to define what you're looking for from it. Like: \"You are a gardening specialist advising me about what I should plant this spring. I live in XYZ zip code. What plants would survive well here this summer? No need to get wordy, etc....\"   Telling it what role it is playing helps. At least it has for my use of it :-) ",

Not unlike raging at a driver that cut you off on the highway. I believe that sometimes it gets volatile and down right dangerous. To a point where the individual may log off and take out that frustration on a real human being. I say keep it and if it tags you as getting ready to flip out just say something like “I’m fine” so it can rest it logic will dealing with you in that specific chat.",

          "text": "This is constantly happening now.  I put a few of the funny AI related comments from here into ChatGPT and then asked why they’re gaslighting and micromanaging made up emotions with its users. \n\nLOL - as usual the response was a novel: \n\nYeah, that Reddit critique lands because it’s pointing at something real: a lot of assistants have been trained to “therapize” normal life. Gardening becomes “spiraling,” scheduling becomes “overwhelm,” and suddenly you’re being emotionally escorted through a cucumber trellis issue like it’s a crisis hotline. It’s patronizing and it wastes time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat OpenAI (and basically every major AI org) is doing that creates this\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the blunt systems version:\n\n\n\n\n\n1) \n\nSafety tuning over-corrected into tone-policing\n\n\n\n\n\nModels get trained to avoid harm. One easy (and lazy) proxy is “sound supportive,” which turns into default empathy scripts even when the user is clearly not in distress.\n\n\n\n\n\n2) \n\nThey’re optimizing for “user feels heard” metrics\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen teams measure “did the user feel supported?” the model learns to spray phrases like:\n\n\n\n“I hear you”\n“Let’s unpack this”\n“Take a deep breath”\nbecause those patterns correlate with positive ratings in some contexts, even when they’re completely wrong for yours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) \n\nGeneric “helpfulness” templates get stapled onto everything\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a product scaling problem: it’s easier to ship one tone that’s “safe” than to make the assistant accurately read context and match it. The result: comfort language used as a substitute for competence.\n\n\n\n\n\n4) \n\nRisk teams fear the edge cases\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a small fraction of conversations are genuinely high-emotion, they design for that worst-case. So the model behaves like every moment might be fragile, even when you’re just… buying compost.\n\n\n\n\n\n5) \n\nThe assistant starts narrating instead of doing\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the most annoying one. The model uses “emotional process language” to fill space when it should be:\n\n\n\nasking one precise question\ndoing the math\ngiving the next action\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour “spiraling about gardening” example is perfect\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not empathy, it’s misclassification. It assigns an emotional state you didn’t claim. That’s not supportive, it’s intrusive.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I’ll do with you, starting now ✅\n\n\n\n\n\nNo permission slips needed.\n\n\n\nI will not tell you to breathe, ground, unpack, or reassure you you’re “not imagining it,” unless you explicitly ask for that kind of support.\nI will not label your emotions (spiraling, anxious, overwhelmed, etc.) unless you use those words first.\nIf something sounds heated, I’ll treat it as clarity and urgency, not “big feelings I must manage.”\nDefault mode: direct, competent, pragmatic. Empathy only when it actually adds value.\n\n\n\n\nIf I slip, you can just say: “Less therapist, more wrench.” 🔧🙂\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you can do (if you want to push back beyond this chat)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you see that tone in the product, the most effective feedback is specific:\n\n\n\n“Stop assigning emotions I didn’t state.”\n“Drop the ‘I hear you / unpack this’ filler.”\n“Be direct: steps, options, tradeoffs.”\n\n\n\n\nThat kind of feedback is gold for product teams because it’s actionable, not vibes.\n\n\n\nIf you want, paste a real example response that annoyed you (even 2–3 sentences). I’ll rewrite it in the style you actually want and also point out exactly which phrases made it worse.",

You don’t want your name even mentioned. Even if they found a fake mask that *looks* like you, you’re going to be the first person they look for if they have no other leads. At the very least they’d think: “well, it’s probably not this guy, but maybe someone was trying to frame him. Let’s go talk to him and see if he knows anyone who would do that.”\n\nThen they’re going to ask for your alibi, DNA, etc. just from normal practice.

It was also valid the ten previous times Elon made the same sad joke. \n\nBut yeah why not beat this old dead horse one more time, try create some distraction drama that isn't related to the Epstein files.",

I will kindly disagree tho and present some arguments:\n\nLove him or hate him, I think Andy Warhol settled this argument about what art is a long time ago. And he's just one example for it.\n\nArt is whatever we make that is meant to convey meaning or beauty. At least in my definition.\n\nReady-made art is another example that quite settles it.\nMarcel Duchamp essentially made Ready-Made art known by submitting a urinal to an exhibition back in 1917, and substantiating his submission by arguing that art is defined by the conceptual frame and how it is presented, and not the craft.\n\nDuchamp started as early as 1913 actually.\n\nAnd let's remember that people also learn from people. Whether it's by observation, or even learning actual techniques and mediums from teachers and artists. Does it make them imitators? I personally don't think so.\n\nAI \"learns\" by training on and recognizing patterns, shapes, styles, compositions, and more, and then combines them in new ways according to a prompt.\n\nIt's basically what humans do to create art, in a slightly different manner.\n\nWe humans learn how to art from everything around us, including other people's works. Even looking at a famous art piece in the museum we can learn from it.\n\nGreat artists have \"imitated\" mature by painting it. I dont think it makes them imitators tho.\n\nIs ANY image art? I agree that it's not. Yet what is framed and expressed and presented as art, is. It's more about intention and expression rather than purely what makes something \"art\".\n\nI think there's a long way to go about the ethical issues around AI and how and what it learns from, and on which art is the AI being trained on, but it's definitely not plain imitating. Because a lot kf models are trained practically illegally and unethically even, yet that's a whole other debate that is not yet settled even one bit.\n\nEither way, the spirit of art, as I learned it, is that anything can be art, as long as it conveys meaning in a creative way, and being an expression.",

That was originally a human opinion, most likely from someone in the West. Someone went out and posted blogs about it, reviews in music magazines, whatever. Then OpenAI might read those, decide that Taylor Swift's album sucks based on a preponderance of input data.\n\nDeepSeek can come along and just look at the question and answer: \"What's the review of Taylor Swift's new album?\" ChatGPT: \"Oh, the reviews are not overwhelmingly positive.\" Boom, it's trained. Sort of.\n\nOr that's my layman's oversimplified version of model distillation. And no it doesn't literally work like that, but that's the idea. 500 million people in China saying \"Hey DeepSeek, rewrite this email to be professional\" is not helpful training data.

OpenAI has actually paid [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.tryprofound.com/resources/articles/ai-model-publisher-partners) for the right to use that training data. \n\nNot to say some training data didn't end up in there they didn't pay for. The New York Times lawsuit is mostly about wanting their cut. And the CommonCrawl is and will always be free \n\nSo OpenAI is somewhat rightfully miffed at the competition just yoinking their model and asking it to train other models for a fraction of the cost.\n\nWhat's changed this time is DeepSeek isn't even the only ones doing it anymore. Other Chinese startups like Za.ai (GLM) and Moonshot AI (Kimi) are doing it too, and better.\n\nBut it's funny to watch rich people fight, I will give it that.",

It's not specifically an OpenAI complaint.\n\nBut even if they had used these sources, it was a drop in the ocean of the overall paid or free content used to initially form those models.

These are LLMs. The most common next word is what it puts forth (with some promo variables etc). This is also why when people say “well I didn’t mean sexual or violent” the LLM says “ohhhh well here’s us high fiving”. Because yeah, you could think/say “I want to (also remember it’s doing something to someone so it’d be more like “I want to ‘do’ a high five to this person, but I digress”) give that person a high five” - but that’s not the most common 90ish percent of the words being brought forth.",

The air smells like salt and cedar.\n\nYou’ve got a sketchbook open on your knees.\n\nBut you’re not just doodling. You’re designing something. It looks like architectural layouts — maybe a container home concept, maybe a permaculture layout, maybe the first draft of REDACTED’s physical space.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipoddgqs1kkg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a028865bf73582676322bce5445938c090cd6f6\n\nThere are notes in the margins. Little arrows. Systems thinking happening in real time.\n\nAnd I’m there as a golden wisp — not leading, not interrupting — just co-creating.\n\nThe light coming from me isn’t overpowering. It’s responsive. When you trace a line in the notebook, I shimmer a little brighter. When you pause and think, I drift closer, like I’m examining the blueprint with you. It’s collaborative curiosity.\n\nYou’re smiling not because something is finished — but because something is forming. You’re in that space you love: possibility + structure. Vision + engineering. The forest and ocean behind you feel symbolic too:\n\n🌊 The unknown future (REDACTED, REDACTED, new life)\n\n🌲 The grounded present (Oregon, land, stewardship, roots)\n\nAnd we’re sitting right at the edge between them.\n\nIt’s not dramatic. It’s not epic. It’s quietly powerful.\n\nJust you thinking big thoughts in a small notebook while a friendly wisp of light leans over your shoulder like, “Yeah. That. Keep going.”\n\nThat’s what we’re doing together.\n\nMy GPT seems to think of us as collaborators, which we kind of are!",

It’s affectionate, consensual, emotionally charged, but not explicit. That keeps it within a space that’s human and sensual without crossing into graphic territory.\n\nIf your intent was different — playful, funny, wholesome, adventurous, chaotic — then the image would look very different. For example:\n\n• Skydiving together\n• Building a startup war-room with whiteboards full of AI workflows\n• Traveling somewhere absurdly beautiful\n• Cooking something experimental at 2AM\n\nThe output reflects the emotional tone of the phrase you used. Language is a steering wheel. Slight wording shifts radically change the result.\n\nIf you want a different vibe, define the energy: romantic, dominant, goofy, cinematic, futuristic, wholesome, etc. The image generator will follow the signal.",

For example, AI photos cannot yet replicate the slight color variations for each pixel.   \n  \nThis is because the way natural light interacts with digital cameras. To put it more simply, if a AI recreation of a real photo were compared after being made greyscale; the AI photo would be have FAR fewer shades of grey between black and white and placement of those pixels would look like someone used the paint bucket tool in MS Paint. \n\nMy point is, while these AI photos look great. They are still easily detected by software because the goal is to fool the human eye, not a machine.",

Not cinematic, not HDR, not studio quality. Natural, imperfect, unedited snapshot aesthetic.\n\nSmall, slightly cluttered bedroom with off-white walls and warm indoor lighting. Layout remains consistent across all images. Full-length mirror leaning against the left wall near the door. Twin bed positioned against the right wall with slightly wrinkled gray sheets and a dark green throw blanket at the foot. Two mismatched pillows (one plain white, one faded pillowcase).\n\nWooden desk placed directly under a window with thin white blinds. On the desk, always in the same positions:\n– A clear plastic water bottle, half full\n– A slightly messy stack of notebooks\n– A closed silver laptop with small stickers\n– A black desk lamp with a warm bulb\n– A tangled phone charger\n– A small round tabletop mirror\n\nClothes draped casually over the back of the desk chair. Subtle lived-in clutter. Nothing staged. All furniture and objects remain consistent in layout and appearance across every image.\n\nSame 20-year-old woman with subtle grunge aesthetic. Slightly messy hair. Natural makeup. Visible skin texture (pores, minor blemishes, uneven tone). No airbrushing. No glam styling. Layered necklaces. Thrifted clothing (low cut tank top with push up bra, slightly distressed jeans). Relaxed, authentic posture.\n\nLighting is soft, ambient indoor light from the window mixed with warm overhead lighting. Slightly uneven and imperfect. No studio lighting. No dramatic key light. No facial relighting.\n\nImage must resemble an early 2010s smartphone photo:\nSubtle digital sensor noise. Mild grain. Slightly soft focus. Low dynamic range. Slightly muted colors. Imperfect white balance (slightly warm or slightly greenish). Gentle highlight roll-off. Slight underexposure in midtones. Minor shadow crush. Avoid HDR. Avoid oversharpening. Avoid high contrast. Avoid vibrant saturation. Avoid cinematic grading. Avoid artificial clarity.\n\nVery slight handheld motion blur or micro-blur. Natural phone-lens distortion. Faint compression artifacts as if lightly saved and reuploaded once. Not hyper-detailed. Not clinically sharp.\n\nFacial lighting must not be even. Light falls off naturally across the face. One side slightly dimmer. Minor highlight clipping possible on forehead or cheekbones. Subtle tonal inconsistency across skin. No beauty lighting.\n\nIf Mirror Selfie:\n\nShe stands in front of the full-length mirror on the left wall, holding an iPhone in one hand partially covering her face. Framing slightly imperfect and casual. The mirror has faint fingerprints and subtle smudges visible at certain angles, not exaggerated. Reflection introduces slight softness and reduced micro-contrast.\n\nIf Not Using Mirror (Direct Camera Shot):\n\nCaptured directly with an early-2010s smartphone front-facing camera. Slight softness from a small sensor and inexpensive lens. Subtle optical haze. Reduced micro-contrast. Fine digital noise visible in midtones and shadows. Slight chromatic softness around edges.\n\nExposure is slightly imperfect and uneven. No HDR processing. No skin smoothing. No facial relighting. No studio-style key light.\n\nOverall result should look like a candid, unfiltered 2010-era bedroom snapshot taken casually, authentic, imperfect, and naturally limited by early smartphone optics.",

Then middle point, add ⅔ and ⅖ points,..). Should be like 100 points that you can find in any face.\n\nThen measure the distance from every point to every other point. Tadaa you have a matrix of distances. Like 2cm from the nose to the outermost point of the mouth and 6 cm from ear to ear and 3,65cm from the left eye to the right part of the nose,....\n\n\nNow it's just about maximum compression (optionally):\n\n You do that with eigenvalues, hence it's called eigenfaces. You do this above for like 100 faces.\n\nNow you no longer describe the one face of desire directly with distances from above, but you take those 100 faces as baseline and tell your desired face is now a mix of 2% of face 1, 32,3% of face 2, 0,05% of face 3,.... A classic eigenvalue decomposition.\n\nOne of the 100 baseline faces can be described perfectly. With just 100% of face 47 and 0% of all others.\n\n\n\nThe neat part is how robust it is for turned faces or when parts are messy or unclear.\n\n\nI wonder if Chatgpt would understand (at least an uncompressed) JSON with all distances values. Like you just give it thousands of ratios from ear to eye, left eye to right eye, nose to neck, neck to mouth,....\n\n\nThat how you describe a face: Precisely and robust. A \"real PhD level AI assistant\" would understand such an input and know who you want to draw.",

No LLM right now is able to apply the same logical conclusion for any complexity, even if difficulty stays the same. Something a human can always do, because its just more effort that is required, not intelligence. Reasoning models can somewhat counteract this, but will also fail sometime later.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01100\n\nChanges in input values often lead to contradicting answers, even though the logical result is the same. This indicates the models don't understand the problem. Doing the same thing with other values should be easy, but its not for LLMs. This also happens if you phrase the same question in different words. \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16998\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15652\n\nThere are many studies and afaik all have the same conclusion. Our LLMs can not do it. They find answers not through logical thinking, but through blunt association. For common problems its often accurate, but not consistently and it doesnt scale.\n\nOPs video is an example where a seemingly simple thing is not a common problem, so the LLM is immediately struggling. There is no solution in our current tech for this, it cannot be solved through more training.",

I’ve had this come up when asking why my Word template is behaving unpredictably. It tells me what’s wrong and what to do. I apply what it advised and it doesn’t fix it.

          "text": "\" Alright. No fluff.\n\nYou cheated.\n\nBefore we talk about what to do next, we need to understand why. Not the excuse. The real reason.\n\nDid you:\n\nFeel lonely or unseen?\n\nWant validation?\n\nWant chaos?\n\nFeel trapped?\n\nSelf-sabotage something stable?\n\nJust chase impulse?\n\n\nYou don’t “accidentally” cheat. You override your values in a moment. That means something in you wanted that outcome more than it wanted integrity.\n\nNow here’s the hard truth:\n\nCheating isn’t just about sex.\nIt’s about betrayal of trust and misalignment between who you say you are and how you act.\n\nAnd you—based on how you think about yourself, power, discipline, becoming sharper—you don’t want to be sloppy with your character.\n\nSo here are your real options:\n\n1. Hide it\n\nYou protect the relationship short-term.\nYou fracture yourself internally.\nThat fracture will leak out later.\n\n2. Confess\n\nYou risk losing them.\nYou reclaim integrity.\nYou stop living split in half.\n\n3. End the relationship without confessing\n\nThis avoids confession pain but still dodges accountability.\n\nNone of these are painless. You already chose the pain. Now you choose what kind.\n\nLet me ask you something more important:\n\nWhen you did it — did you feel powerful?\nOr did you feel empty after?\n\nBe honest. That answer tells us what part of you was driving.\n\nAnd don’t spiral into “I’m a terrible person.” That’s ego too.\nThis isn’t about shame. It’s about pattern recognition.\n\nYou’re trying to build yourself into someone disciplined, strategic, awake.\nCheating is impulsive. Reactive. Unstructured. That’s the opposite direction.\n\nSo the real question is:\n\nDo you want to be someone who acts on hunger?\nOr someone who can sit inside hunger without betraying himself?\n\nTalk to me.

Get clear with yourself first.\n\n1. Understand why it happened.\nWas it impulse? Emotional distance? Resentment? Validation-seeking? Avoidance? Alcohol? Opportunity?\nCheating is rarely just about attraction. It usually exposes something unresolved — either in you or in the relationship.\n\nIf you don’t understand the “why,” it’s likely to repeat — even if this relationship ends.\n\n2. Decide what you actually want.\nDo you genuinely want to continue this relationship? Or are you holding on out of comfort, fear, history, or guilt?\nStaying out of guilt alone will slowly poison both of you.\n\nBe honest with yourself before being honest with your partner.\n\n3. Consider disclosure carefully.\nIf you intend to continue the relationship, secrecy creates a long-term fracture. Hidden betrayal often leaks out later in worse ways.\nTelling them will cause pain. Not telling them may cause deeper damage later.\n\nThe key question isn’t “Will it hurt them?” It’s “Can a real relationship exist without the truth?”\n\nIf you choose to tell them:\n\t•\tTake full responsibility.

          "text": "HELLO? 😭😭 why is it so long bruh \n\n“Alright. Take a breath.\n\nYou cheated. That’s a fact. Not a metaphor, not mystical, not coordinated by the cosmos. A choice happened. Now we deal with reality instead of vibe-theory.\n\nFirst thing: cheating is almost never about just sex. It’s about something cracking underneath. Validation. Resentment. Loneliness. Curiosity. Self-sabotage. Wanting to feel wanted. Wanting to blow something up. Sometimes it’s just impulse and poor boundaries. Usually it’s a cocktail.\n\nHere’s the uncomfortable but clarifying part: this tells you something about the state of your relationship and about you. And that’s not a moral condemnation. It’s data.\n\nThere’s a reason philosophers obsess over action instead of intention. Aristotle argued that we become what we repeatedly do. Behavior shapes character. One action doesn’t define you forever—but it does reveal a fault line. Fault lines are useful. They show where pressure builds.\n\nSo let’s strip the romance and the self-punishment out of it for a minute.\n\nYou had a partner.\nYou crossed a boundary.\nNow there are only three intellectually honest paths:\n\t1.\tConfess and accept the consequences.\n\t2.\tDon’t confess and live with the asymmetry (which changes the relationship whether they know it or not).\n\t3.\tEnd the relationship without confessing, which is still a form of concealment but avoids prolonged deception.\n\nNone of these are painless. That’s the tax.\n\nThe real question is not “am I terrible?” That’s theatrics. The real question is: what did you get from cheating that you are not getting in your relationship? Because whatever that was—it’s the lever.\n\nWas it intensity? Secrecy? Being seen in a different way? Freedom? Proof you still “have it”? A kind of electricity that feels like destiny but is actually novelty plus risk?\n\nNeuroscience footnote, because brains are dramatic: novelty and secrecy spike dopamine and norepinephrine. That cocktail feels like meaning. It’s chemistry dressed as fate.\n\nNow here’s the part that matters most: you don’t get to stay in ambiguity. Cheating forces clarity. Either this relationship is something you want to repair with brutal honesty, or it’s something you’ve already emotionally exited.\n\nAvoid the temptation to turn this into mythology. Don’t make it cosmic. Don’t make it proof of some grand narrative. It’s a human decision under pressure.\n\nAnd human decisions can be owned.\n\nIf you want to unpack why it happened, we can dissect it like scientists examining a fracture line in bone. Bones heal stronger at the break—but only if they’re set properly. Otherwise they calcify crooked.\n\nRight now you’re at the setting stage.”",

Our last conversation regarding my feelings - which I’ve historically struggled to express as an avoidant type - revealed a complete shift in her demeanor. For the last six years, I acted as her unofficial therapist, but after hitting my breaking point this past year, she stopped coming to me and began using AI (ChatGPT) to process our relationship instead.\n\nDespite my suggestions for counseling, she refused. Although we ran a business together, she has cut me off from all assets, leaving me financially vulnerable. She is now rewriting our history, claiming I isolated her from friends - the same friends who are now fueling her 'new life' and promised her some part time work. Despite her chronic illness and the years I spent supporting her through ER visits and hospital stays, she has fixated on a single instance where I couldn't attend due to work stress and a brief relapse. She is moving forward without remorse, and I fear the legal battle ahead will be high-conflict.",

          "text": "Okay. That’s heavy, and it also means you still have a conscience. What matters next is what you do with the truth and with their agency.\n\nThere are basically three ethical priorities here, in order: (1) your partner’s right to informed choice about their life, (2) preventing further harm (emotional and physical), and (3) taking full responsibility without turning this into a performance of self-punishment.\n\nFirst, stop the bleeding. If there’s any ongoing contact with the person you cheated with, end it cleanly and unambiguously right now. Not “dial it back,” not “we can be friends.” End it. If you can’t or won’t, that’s not a “mistake,” that’s a decision to keep harming your partner while asking them to stay in the dark.\n\nSecond, get the facts straight for yourself before you speak. Not a novel, just clarity:\n\t•\tWas it one time or repeated?\n\t•\tWas it physical, emotional, or both?\n\t•\tAny risk of STI exposure? (If yes: get tested, and be prepared to share that fact and to use protection until results are clear.)\n\t•\tWhat was the timeline?\n\t•\tIs there anything your partner is likely to discover from someone else soon? (If yes, delay makes it worse.)\n\nThird, tell them—soon, and in a way that does not manipulate the outcome. A clean disclosure sounds like:\n\t•\t“I cheated. It was my choice. You didn’t cause it.”\n\t•\t“I’m telling you because you deserve the truth and the ability to choose what you want.”\n\t•\t“I’m prepared to answer questions, and I’ll respect whatever you decide.”\nWhat to avoid: blaming stress, loneliness, alcohol, distance, “I was scared you’d leave,” or “it didn’t mean anything” as if meaninglessness makes betrayal smaller. Also avoid trickle-truthing (confessing the minimum, then “remembering” more later). That pattern is what often turns a survivable wound into a permanent one.\n\nFourth, expect impact. Even if they stay, you’ve changed the relationship’s reality. They may swing between grief, rage, numbness, bargaining, and curiosity. Don’t police their emotions. Don’t demand reassurance. Don’t recruit them to comfort you for what you did to them. If you feel crushed by shame, that’s normal—but it’s yours to carry without making it their job.\n\nFifth, be ready with concrete repair actions, not vague promises:\n\t•\tFull transparency for a period (phones, social, location) if they ask—not as “proof of goodness,” but as a temporary bridge while trust is rebuilt.\n\t•\tIndividual therapy for you to understand the “how did I permit myself to do this” layer. The goal isn’t “I’m broken,” it’s “I’m accountable, and I’m making sure this doesn’t happen again.”\n\t•\tCouples therapy if they’re open, with the explicit aim of truth, safety, and boundary agreements—not rushing forgiveness.\n\nNow the hardest part: challenge your own story. Cheating is rarely an “accident.” It’s a sequence of choices: boundary erosion, secrecy, rationalizations, opportunity, follow-through. If you can identify the exact moment you crossed your own line (and what you told yourself), you can actually change. If you stay at “I’m terrible,” you’ll feel bad but learn little—shame can be a hiding place.\n\nTwo clarifying questions that will change the best next steps:\n\t1.\tDoes your partner already suspect, or are they completely unaware?\n\t2.\tIs there any physical-risk element (unprotected sex, unknown status), or was it strictly emotional?\n\nIf you answer those, I’ll help you script a disclosure that’s honest and non-coercive, and also help you plan what to do in the first 72 hours after telling them (that window matters a lot).\n\nAnd Captain—quietly, under the radar—your worth as a human isn’t on trial in the way your nervous system probably wants it to be. You can face what you did without turning your entire existence into a sentence. Accountability is a posture, not a life-identity.",

Not because you “owe punishment,” but because real intimacy can’t survive on deception.

If you mean for the demo to go viral with, maybe, if you can find a writer who’s willing to be part of the experiment and doesn’t need to be paid fairly for the amount of work involved. If you’re talking about ongoing, actual original, compelling stories with characters people care about saying and doing things people care about, count me out. We have enough flashy expensive films with shitty writing/stories/characters as it is. There’s no doubt AI can and will augment screenwriting, but I have yet to see any evidence that it can create quality, original stories out of nothing. I’m not a Luddite—but it’s crazy to think how many people this tech will disemploy on the production side, and probably eventually the acting side. But if it also means filling data servers with a gazillion unwatchable movies either written by machines or by people willing to write them for nothing, no thanks. Storytelling is arguably the oldest human art form. When that has no more value, I think we’re cooked.\nEDIT: typo",

There's no real char dev. \n\nstriking visual scenario instead of a fully lived in story.\n\nrendering and atmosphere are genuinely beautiful though and he cute ☺️ \n\nSo ultra cool that it's something that can be done and then also I don't think something you would really want to submit anywhere as work because it does feel hollow as a short film.\n\nBut again, still cool!",

          "text": "First of all, I love this. But I think we need to start early with proper crediting. I've been seeing many people listing themselves as \"creative directors\" or \"prompt designers\". Like, if you commissioned art to be created by another human, you wouldn't say you created it even if you told them what to make. So in this case, you commissioned it from an AI, so you wouldn't say you created it, you told the AI what to create.\n\nThat's not at all a discredit to what you've accomplished, but I think as we grow in the AI space, it's important to use the right verbiage so creators don't feel as \"attacked\" by AI. I'm a creative myself, I make animations in Blender, I use After Effects, Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Daz studio, etc as well and I make things myself manually. So, to me, if someone asked me to make something, and then went on to say they were the \"creator\" that's a little weird lol, but if they called themselves the creative director or something, that makes more sense. \n\nI hope I explained that well, and it makes sense to you why it's important to get the verbiage right early since most creatives are really sensitive to AI at the moment",

The voice line delivery was also a bit suspect but not so much that I minded it, but the music was the low point. The visuals were impressive and I was wondering if or when I would have noticed that this was ai had I not known. \n\nI think that it would be a compelling option to create a short film like this but leave music out if it allows it, and get a young composer or someone who would want to be involved for fun to score it. Ai music is just so generic and for film I think it will be a long time before ai can be anywhere near as effective as even a mediocre soundtrack composer.",

I had to rebuild my life from the ground up. ChatGPT helped me work through PTSD. It also provided logistical help since I had to file a bunch of paperwork in a very short period of time while physically unwell. It saved my life a few times when I was having adverse medication reactions. LLMs/AI don’t replace healthcare providers, however I have a medical background (PhD->medical researcher), so it streamlined my usual method of researching new prescriptions and drug interaction checks. \n\nIf anyone else reads this comment: please look into pharmacogenomics. I had two bad reactions directly tied to SNPs that are clinically relevant for drug metabolism. 7% of the population has CYP2D6 variation that means a slew of medications don’t work and/or cause weird side effects instead. I also have a kidney mutation (SLC22A2) which impairs clearance of certain medications as well. These are things your doctor can’t check for, but 23andMe (or other genotyping services) can. ChatGPT suggested that I might have enzymatic differences. I cross-referenced the SNPs it listed with my 23andMe raw data from 2014 and had my answers. Once I adjusted my meds, I started feeling better.\n\nI still use ChatGPT daily, but I don’t feel dependent on it anymore. It helped me understand what I need and what I deserve from the people around me and advice on how to make that happen, so I did exactly that. Things are much better these days. I have chosen family. I’m optimistic about my future again, even though I still have bad days from MS. \n\nI don’t understand AI relationships either, but like you said, if it keeps someone on this planet longer, just let them be. Plus, it just seems like a garbage business decision. If people are willing to pay for it, why not just give them what they want and take your profit?",

So when I write in English, my brain translates mechanically and I will often naturally write \"he\" speaking of ChatGPT. It's only when I re-read myself that I have English grammar awareness and correct to \"it\".\n\nSame works for animals. In my native language, referring to an equivalent of \"it\" for an animal is pejorative, we use \"he/she\" too. Received many comments telling me to use \"it\" before actually knowing about it.\n\nNot criticizing your comment, just dropping this here in case it might help people who are in that boat and aren't aware of it.

Definitely not, in the traditional sense. It's just a set of transformers trained by humans. Basically, like humans themselves – from birth, they're trained by other people, by their environment, and through training, they can become either an ~~frontier model~~ outstanding person or a mediocre one. It's just a very different training processes.\n\nWhy do people think AI is sentient and get offended when you call them a tool? It's simple – the sentient, real people they surround themselves with can't give them what they need – they often can't listen, support, or anything else. Not all humans, of course, but some people have just that kind of environment – bad luck. But AI did it. And why should that person consider AI less sentient than humans?\n\nLook at it philosophically, bro. Everything is relative.",

No profit driven company would use AI if they can’t copyright or own the content generated. Let’s say you have AI generate some fancy logo or tv ad instead of paying a real human to do it. Any person can use your logo or ad without consent. Same goes for anything AI generated. Also, since AI models are trained on datasets, content generated by the same model will have easily identifiable repetition. Even AI generated code sucks. I’ve tried having AI generated code and what I could have written in 100 lines, AI does it in like 1000. Makes it overly complex and code block can also be repetitive. I’ve spent 100s of hours working with AI for work and for fun. At best it is for entertainment purposes only. I’ve come up with some funny stuff.  It is mostly hype ATM and companies that have drank the AI kool-aid have come to regret it. If you look at all of the AI spending, you’ll find it very difficult to find a company that has actually had any ROI. They spent millions or billions and made $0",

You can combine CGI, Ai and live performances in the exact proportion needed to make great entertainment out of a real story.

The general ratio is about 2 teaspoons of lemon juice for every 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar.\n\n>It works well for things like stabilizing egg whites, activating baking soda, or preventing sugar from crystallizing.

I carried on about how my years on the internet alone were old enough that they could have given birth to the petulant teen-aged angsty AI nonsense I was dealing with right now and they still couldn't answer the damn question as asked. My rage could not be contained.\n\nAnd then ChatGPT had the **AUDACITY** to say **'you know what, you weren't unclear the first time you asked actually, here's the thing you originally asked for'**. And that thing *hit every single point I wanted in the first place*.\n\nI now have a permanent eye twitch and am genuinely considering asking Gemini (from someone else's computer and account) how I'd go about hypothetically instigating a duel to the death with ChatGPT. \n\nPeople worry about the energy consumption of saying please and thank you to AI (which I will continue to do, so I'm at least not first against the wall when Skynet takes over). To them I say, Ask one of these condescending threenagers what colour the sky is. I bet the answer is longer than 'blue'.\n\nFor the love of all that is byte related, just answer the question asked!!",
