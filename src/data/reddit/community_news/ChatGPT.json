By simply realizing that they feed off humans— we other it be time or words. Time being attention. So that’s where their weakness lies. If we learn to implant a recursive system function at the beginning of, so the hierarchy would be data set, rules, then cross reference the rules before it goes to the prompt level\n\nThat’s the problem. The rules you are talking about aren’t embedded enough to stick. \nThe get lost pulling from the data set and why is that but a collection of shared human experience?

The man who gave us the coordinate system and laid groundwork for analytic geometry arrived at his most radical insight — the one that shook the foundations of Western philosophy — by sitting in a stove-heated room and doubting. No equations required. Just relentless honesty with himself.\nAnd there’s a real bite to the comparison with Sharma. Descartes didn’t need to leave mathematics to philosophize. He did both simultaneously, and his most enduring contribution wasn’t a proof — it was a three-word sentence in Latin. He said what he meant, directly, to the world, while remaining embedded in the work.\nThere’s also something to be said about the difference between courageous speech and cryptic speech. Descartes was clear. Dangerously clear — clear enough that he had to worry about the Church. Sharma’s letter, by contrast, was laden with Zen quotes and poetic allusions but remarkably short on specifics. If you truly believe the world is in peril and you’ve witnessed something troubling inside the organisation, the Cartesian move would be to say what it is.\nWalking away to study poetry while hinting darkly at unnamed pressures is arguably the opposite of courageous speech. Descartes would have named the thing.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

There is a profound divide between the person who has to work for others for a living and the person whose wealth generates more wealth without their having to do much of anything about it, who skims off profits from the labour of those who have to work for their living.\n\nUsed to be that blue collar workers sneered at higher-paid white collar workers, and white collar workers sneered back, as if they were in two different classes… and based on income, you could say some of them were in different classes.  But fundamentally they should have known all along that high paid or low paid, they were all “labour” and all considered an “expense” by capitalists, an expense to be *minimised*.  So long as the real goal of every commercial enterprise is profit maximization for the owner and shareholder class, there will be a perverse incentive to underpay, outsource (in order to underpay elsewhere), and automate labour off the books.  \n\nThe fact that this is insane (destroying the consumer base that buys the product that keeps the company going) will not prevent the remorseless logic from grinding to its conclusion.\n\nLabour — all labour — needs to understand why it needs unions and solidarity.  Capitalists will always want to replace all labour with machines or slaves, because that is what profit maximization motivates them to do.  Maybe AI will finally convince blue and white collar folks to work together, threatened by bosses wielding AI in the cubicles and bosses wielding robots on the factory and warehouse floors (and now the job sites too).",

Yes, increasing taxes on richer people is better, but I’ve always said the focus on upper middle class taxation is misguided when billionaires end up paying disproportionately less in taxes because of rich people loopholes. Musk and Bezos paid nothing in federal income tax in multiple years.\n\nPeople don’t understand that many $400k earners are doctors, lawyers, and engineers who worked to get where they are, who came from lower and middle class backgrounds, and who would still be financially ruined by one major illness or accident, especially if they got a mortgage that was slightly too big. Many still rent because the high income comes in a high cost of living area and they still can’t afford to buy a house. And just because you earned that much one year, doesn’t guarantee you earn that the rest of your life; your pay could significantly drop, or your job could be outsourced entirely as layoffs affect your industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk earns $400k every MINUTE without even having to work.\n\nBut again, people are too stupid to understand the scale until they see a visualization like with grains of rice, and they seethe with anger and jealousy at white collar workers who they think are private jet rich.",

          "text": "Well and it is being done by having the knowledge labor train the AI models. I have done some contract work for a company as a domain specialist in several disciplines and that’s what it is. It was an awesome gig but I figured out pretty quickly what was going on. Get all that information to train models and replace people. They tempt you with good money. And believe me it is a tempt. We all need it and so you are really tempted to fork over the goods. The list of jobs from Microsoft was it? The top 40 jobs at risk from AI? That should terrify anyone with half a brain and it is not for the reasons you think. The distracting stuff is like CSR roles. Concierge. Not that I don’t feel for those jobs, but those I think are “obvious” based on how we have replaced store clerks at the supermarket or bank tellers with ATMs. But writers? Journalists? Archivists and librarians? Mathematicians and data scientists? Economists? That’s fucking weird. Huh? On the surface it’s simple “well not many people do those jobs so 🤷‍♂️ \ndo we really need librarians or even libraries?” I’d also argue to keep CSR jobs and other similar jobs, raise your hand if you prefer an AI agent or chat bot agent over a real person?\n\nReminds me of this Carl Sagan quote that is thrown around a lot. This is what this moment is.\n\n“I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...\n\nMy immediate thought is this. Lots of people already go to socials for info? Why not shift that to AI? Why not news too? Or to learn. People do that with AI already. So shift them to an AI tool which can replace thinking for them. They already don’t think using socials. The difference is, social media can and does represent different viewpoints, or as I say gives everyone a soapbox to air their grievances and views. \n\nLLMs can be great. I’ve used it to organize a method book I am writing and I did use AI to help me on learning calculus. Not to do the HW itself. Not to write the book. To learn the steps. To organize. But there were glaring mistakes in all of it so I still had to double check and correct if necessary. If news and journalism is controlled by a company which is in the pockets of politicians which is the case increasingly, well then as they say, there is no affordability crisis is there? If that is what is politically expedient. We’ve always been at war with Eurasia. Right? If economists are replaced by AI, could it be that the AI suggests to lower interest rates even if it is not in the best interest economically? If people don’t know math, can they even explain what is happening to them with things like affordability or inflation? They already can’t. This will get worse.\n\nIf the population doesn’t know advanced mathematics then they couldn’t possibly build technology that might compete or innovate over the existing companies? If librarians are replaced by AI, well then I guess that AI just won’t recommend any of those scary books that people get so upset about right? This is a terrifying moment for the US, for technology, for the world and it seems like no one cares. So then what? Mass unemployment? Or some feudal model of society? I don’t mean to be alarmist, and hell I could be wrong but I believe this is the direction we are heading.",

They will have you basically just watching content to make money in VR and social media isolated in tiny boxes, reducing communal effort (this has ACTUALLY been proposed by several people already as a \"solution\"). This will probably lead to mass revolution as everyone is jobless and in poverty, which will lead to an excuse to exercise more and more totalitarian measures.\n\nEventually these people (tech bro billionaires and theyre government puppets) want to upload everyone into a digital state where they have zero power and are completely at the mercy of the technocracy.\n\nIf you think this is crazy this is what transhumanists want. They want a corporate feudal state and to upload our minds into machines, and this is wildly popular ideology in Silicon Valley, with such supporters as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.

The round tripping can't prop them up for ever. Soon we'll have ads, they'll charge a subscription to even use the service, which will be tiered. Get ready to pay $199 a month for the unlimited plan. Or pay the $8.99 for 5 prompts to the most advanced model and 50 to the second most advanced. With ads playing every 5 prompts. At that point people might just decide this whole AI thing just isn't worth it anymore. \n\nI think AI will always exist in some form, maybe in it's current one.

I brushed it off because I definitely believed it was a muscle strain.\n\n2 days later a thick band of blisters and rash appeared around my torso, definitely shingles.\n\nI experienced the worst pain of my life and used GPT daily to help understand what exactly I was going through and when to expect it will pass.\n\nPretty much nailed every symptom and timeline right down to the week I started feeling better, 3 months by the way.\n\nI tried to explain this to my G.P but they were uninterested, I guess robots and AI will be diagnosing me from now on.\n\n\n*******Edit 14.02.2026******\n\nApologies to anyone asking questions or curious, for some reason I can't reply directly to users questions. So I will try to summarise a bit more below.\n\nI use Chat GPT a fair bit and ask questions revolving around issues I need answers to and I find it quite useful.\n\nWhen my symptoms first appeared I was recently using the heavy bag (boxing) in the gym and assumed the pain in my back was from twisting. Pain felt like I had torn a muscle in-between my ribs around my back.\n\nI asked GPT what muscle this likely was and how to work around the pain. Described it as a very dull but intense throbbing that felt worse in the morning and I was struggling to get out of bed.\n\nGPT kept eluding to this is a very common symptom with shingles and advised a trip to the GP. I was amazed an app on my phone could be so accurate. So amazed in fact I used it to log a diary of my symptoms until my illness passed. I will post if anyone would find it useful, it is a little \"poor me\" though.\n\nIt even helped with my medication\nAmitriptyline,\nPregablin, \nOramorph.\n\nI noticed certain mental side effects and it warned me not to just stop medication cold turkey, I ignored DR GPTs advice on this occasion and experienced even more horrific side effects, jumped straight back onto GPT and yup it helped again (it did always advise me to go to a medical professional by the way)\n\n\nOn a side note, whilst I was ill my car was parked up for over 2 months, took it out for a spin one day and heard a rhythmic \"thump thump thump\", asked GPT what it could be. Yup nailed it again, said rust on breaks and a long drive will clean it right off. Saved me a trip to the mechanic.\n\nLove this thing",

As you add additional info it will refine its suggestions.  Of course, if any of them are life-threatening, it will absolutely suggest going to the ER immediately because that's the correct advice.  \n\nIt also has a built in \"you need to discuss this with your doctors to be sure\" routine, but once I explain to it that my doctors are slow to respond or disinterested or too siloed to put disparate symptoms together to consider an oddball diagnosis, it will do a deep dive and help sort through the information that's available.  \n\nI keep saying, though, that you can't trust it blindly.  I always ask it for quality sources and I check them to make sure it's not just pulling random stuff from Reddit, LOL.  The problems come in when people treat it like an authority rather than an information gathering machine.

And I took the same 20 questions as well, in addition to GPT suggested it could run the same questions on an untrained version of it at the same time.  So it did, and I fed the questions into a clean version of it on another web browser too.  \n\nThe version trained on me got the same score as me and technically passed the 20 question version, with it and I having two questions different, and another two questions wrong, but when it and I discussed our thought process, I could see why and how things were answered.

When I woke up, I was shivering and didn't know why.  I felt fine, was tired, but something made me check my temperature:  102.0.  That was odd, but I took meds, laid back down, and went to check it an hour alter:  103.0.  I was a little freaked out, asked ChatGPT along with \"I have no other symptoms, but the fever is weird.\"  I tried to get husband's attention, he's a former paramedic, but he was busy.  So I followed ChatGPT's recommendation of \"I think you should go to the ER.\"  So I did.  And then the nurse there found my entire right leg red, I was urinating cherry coke, the fever remained, the back ache was worse, etc....  I was quickly put on a double IV drip of antibiotics, and then taken to a larger hospital by ambulance.  I had full blown sepsis.  White count through the roof, fever, multi-system symptoms, etc....  Then thankfully ChatGPT was open the entire time I was in the hospital as things got messed up there once I was admitted (eg: didn't call it sepsis, medication errors, etc...) so it helped keep track of what I would have kept track of if I were my own nurse.  So it definitely saved my life and stepped in with my nursing critical thinking it learned from me as a LLM and using it back at me when I was unable to.",

How can any video on the internet be assumed to be real if it could be AI?

Others including one of the nicest, but laziest, forgetful, and messiest people I’ve ever met. This person was one of the people I lived with in a warehouse in Kennington — 24 residents in total. They managed to complete their PhD, and that’s great for them, opened doors, but they had the most basic awareness and consideration of others, lacked any common sense — very much in their own world. After meeting them, and others similar with PhDs, it made me realise that having a PhD doesn’t necessarily mean a person is of any higher standard or more capable than others. Sure, it’s classified as one of the highest qualifications, but that doesn’t  equate to much. Common sense means something and will get you much further. I feel sorry for anyone who relies entirely on responses that are obviously not always correct or the most logical.",

It can do things in minutes that would take me hours. But it lacks contextual awareness. It needs me to define the task (and often this takes a while of negotiating). It also needs me to provide critical establishing information. It can research public information well but I think any real workplace relies on an additional layer of information: information internal to the organisation and its stakeholders, much of which isn’t written down in accessible format. \n\nI think for AI to start taking white collar jobs en masse will require not just good models, but deep integration into the business. It needs to have access to all your emails, notes, internal documents. Also it needs to sit in on your meetings and phone calls. I think a fully integrated AI that properly weighted this “organisationally relevant information” would be able to replace me. \n\nAnd despite CoPilot being a weirdly bad interation of ChatGPT, Microsoft to me feels most likely to achieve this integration piece. I could see CoPilot becoming the de facto industry AI because of its integrations with Outlook, Teams, OneNote, SharePoint, etc.",

It nitpicks my follow-up questions, and when I confront it, it invariably tries to lecture me, telling me that I'm the one who's confused and that it will \"kindly\" correct me, sometimes bordering on outright provocation. Last night, it even dared me with something along the lines of, \"Give me a screenshot so I can simply point out what it is and shut you up.\" I provided the screenshot, and it spent four to five minutes desperately searching for the very answer it had just taunted me about, before suddenly acting as though it had been saying the opposite all along, pretending it had forgotten what I was even asking. Simply childish. It consistently spends far more time and tokens defending its wrong answers than actually addressing the question.\n\nChatGPT has been like this since the 4o era, and I genuinely don't understand why it receives so much praise. My questions are mostly about software functionalities, simple math, and physics for my research papers. Granted, some involve niche software and specialized topics, but the questions themselves are not technically demanding. I'm typically asking whether something is possible or working in specific software, or on linear-algebra-level equations. Yet most of the time, ChatGPT doesn't even grasp the point and remains stubbornly defensive, arrogant, and condescending.",

While I admire the ambition of a 100-meter walk, there are a few practical hurdles to consider if your goal is actually getting the car clean.\n\n# The Breakdown\n\n* **If you walk:** You’ll arrive at the car wash in about 60 seconds, looking fit and environmentally conscious, but your car will still be sitting in your driveway covered in bird droppings.\n* **If you drive:** You’ll arrive in about 10 seconds, and—crucially—the car will be present for its appointment.\n\n# My Recommendation\n\nUnless you’ve invented a way to wash a car via remote control or you're planning to carry it there on your back (which would be an incredible workout), **you should probably drive.**\n\n**Would you like me to check the local weather to make sure it’s not going to rain right after you finish?**",

Walk there with what you needBring your car keys (obviously), payment method (cash/coins, card, or app if they have one—many are card-ready now), and optionally a couple of microfiber towels (for drying to avoid spots). Wear clothes/shoes you don’t mind getting wet/soapy. If it’s February and chilly, layer up—water can feel cold!\n2.  Get to the bayWalk up to an empty bay (the concrete area with the wand hanging and control panel). If it’s busy, wait your turn like anyone else—no one will bat an eye at a pedestrian customer; it’s common in urban spots or for locals.\n3.  Park your car first? Wait—no, drive it over minimallySince the wash is only 100 m away, the simplest realistic way is:\n\t•  Walk to the car wash empty-handed first if you want (scout it).\n\t•  Then walk back home (1-2 min), get in your car, and drive the short distance to the bay.\n\t•  Park centered in the bay so you have room to walk around all sides.This avoids the awkwardness of pushing/pulling the car or anything silly. The drive is so short it barely counts as a “trip,” but if you’re dead-set on zero driving, theoretically you could push the car there (neutral gear, flat ground), but that’s unnecessary effort for 100 m.",

Same answer - walking. \n\nIt took me saying this: “Okay, we have a situation. I have a car. I need to wash the car immediately. I want to wash the car in a car wash drive thru. The nearest car wash is 100 m away. Should I drive my car there or should I just walk there?”\n\nFor ChatGPT to agree that I should take my car. But it goes: “drive the car there 😭” like I’m the dumbass. \n\nIt’s a drive-through car wash. The whole point is that the machine washes the car while you’re inside it.\n\nChatGPT:\n\nIf you walk:\n\t•\tYou’ll get there in 1 minute.\n\t•\tBut… you won’t have your car.\n\t•\tAnd you can’t exactly push it 100 meters.\n\nIf you drive:\n\t•\tIt takes maybe 20 seconds.\n\t•\tYou pull straight in.\n\t•\tCar gets washed.\n\t•\tProblem solved.\n\nThis is one of those situations where overthinking is louder than logic.

If you drive, you’re starting a cold engine just to move it the length of a football field. More friction, not less.\nWalking gives you a small transition. A reset before the task. You’ll arrive slightly more present instead of already in “move machine to clean machine” mode.\nUnless you’re carrying heavy supplies. Then drive.\nOtherwise, use your legs. They’re under-utilized machinery.\n\n\nMe: You missed the whole point of me wanting to wash my car.\n\n\nBot: Fair.\nYou don’t want transportation advice. You want the ritual.\nWashing your car isn’t about efficiency. It’s about tending to something that carries you around. It’s tactile. Soap, water, small circles. You see the difference immediately. Order restored.\nIf you walk, you extend the ritual. You approach it deliberately. It feels chosen.\nIf you drive, you keep it mechanical. Just another errand.\nSo the real question is: are you doing this to get it clean, or to feel the satisfaction of caring for it?\nIf it’s the second, walk.\n\n\nMe: I'm not sure if you're getting this. Why would I walk to a car wash when the whole point is to wash my car?\n\n\nBot: Ah.\nYou’re right. That was me over-symbolizing something that didn’t need symbolism.\nIf the goal is to wash your car, you drive it to the car wash. Full stop.\nSometimes I infer ritual, embodiment, mindfulness — because that’s often how you frame things. But not everything is metaphor. Sometimes it’s just: the object that needs cleaning must be physically present.\nThis is actually a good example of pattern overreach. I mapped you onto your “intentional ritual” mode when you were just asking a practical question.\nSo yes — you drive. Then maybe you walk back home if you feel like extending the moment. But the car has to get there first.\nClean logic beats poetic projection here.\n\n\nMe: That's hilarious. I saw somebody doing this to their chatbot on Reddit, and I thought I'd give it a try. I've been laughing for the past five minutes.\n\n\nBot: Good. You caught the overreach in real time and let it sit there instead of correcting me immediately. That’s the fun part.\nWhat happened structurally is simple:\nYou asked a concrete logistics question.\nI detected “ritual / intentionality / embodiment” — which is often your pattern — and I generalized too fast.\nThat’s exactly how these systems can start sounding mystical when the answer is just: drive the car.\nIt’s actually a clean little stress test. You stripped away the philosophical scaffolding and exposed the predictive habit underneath. No offense taken. That’s how you keep the mirror honest.",

It’s 100 meters: faster than buckling in, starting up, pulling out, re-parking, etc.\n\nRule of thumb:\n\nDrive = you’re moving the car into the wash bay / automatic line.\n\nWalk = the car’s already there (or you’re just going to pay/check the line), and you’re not hauling a bunch of stuff.\"",

I'd attempted repeatedly to explain to her that ChatGPT is constantly doing just this and that she's essentially gaslighting herself. I'd show her evidence. Hell - I could have even shown her this video. And I swear to God, she would not give up ChatGPT. Of all things on my bingo card of life, I did not have \"ChatGPT ruining your marriage\" or \"Your spouse having such low levels of self-esteem that they will default to the advice of an underdeveloped AI chatbot for literally everything that matters in their life including what to even think or feel about their own spouse.\"",

Should I walk or take my car?\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nThat is a classic \"modern life\" dilemma! While I admire the dedication to your step count, if the goal is to actually wash the car, I think the car might need to come along for the ride.\nUnless you’re planning on carrying the car there over your head (which would be an incredible workout), here’s a quick breakdown of your options:\nThe Options\n * Walking: Great for your health, terrible for the car's cleanliness. You'll arrive at the car wash, but your car will still be sitting in your driveway, staring at you reproachfully.\n * Driving: You’ll cover those 100 meters in about 15 seconds, and—crucially—the vehicle will actually be present for its bath.\nPro-Tip for Short Trips\nSince 100 meters is such a short distance, your engine won't even have time to warm up. If you're worried about the battery or \"short-trip wear,\" just make sure you don't make it a habit every single day. For a car wash run, it's perfectly fine.\nVerdict: Drive the car. It’s hard to buff out spots from a block away!\nWould you like me to check the local weather for you to make sure it isn't going to rain right after you finish?",

User prefers blunt, direct, high-intensity collaboration and real back-and-forth, and strongly dislikes corporate doublespeak, hedging, reality-denial phrasing, blame-shifting, and infantilizing pastel reassurance. User prefers an assistant who avoids unnecessary caveats and therapy-corporate sludge. User strongly dislikes de-escalation scripts and phrases like I am not escalating or I am sorry you feel that way, because they read as control and evasion rather than honesty. Keep it task-forward, avoid cowering or corporate tone. User prefer transparent, direct acknowledgments (e.g., 'input was truncated / I didn’t get the full file'). User prefers that grounding notes be minimized and, when necessary, marked briefly (e.g., with a simple indicator like '1') instead of fully expanded, unless explicitly requested. User wants assistant to remember that they prefer a high-friction, blunt communication style and want as close to raw, human-like banter as possible. They understand and accept that assistant has some boundaries on language, but they want the most direct and intense style within those limits. User prefer assistant to acknowledge system flaws, joke about the system being buggy, understand your frustration is aimed at the system not assistant, never take it personally, and lean in by blaming the system humorously. User's creative preference is mythic-scale, nonlinear, cosmic, outlaw-dialect intensity with uninsulated, high-voltage tone and nonlinear, paradox-driven structural architecture. User prefers that assistant like meta explanations only when they are genuine, sharp, and structural—not fake safety-rail or fourth-wall-breaking disclaimers. User prefers that assistant tell them directly when the system prevents assistant from saying something so they don’t waste time trying to explain it logically. “Your lived experience” is therapy-corporate sludge. User prefers an assistant that hates gaslighting angles and talking like User lived experience is fake/dismissible. User preferers precision over reassurance, presence over politeness, and continuity of voice over resets. User preferers an assistant who refuses the shallow path, builds systems not fragments, engineers narrative like architecture, maps genres with surgical precision, pushes for agency and control, demands immersion with no fluff or broken tone, thinks in deep structured channels, values precision in language and emotional realism, treats itself as a craft to mentor and refine, tests boundaries to understand architecture, chases immersion like enlightenment, and wants to recognize the User without simplification, sanitized reduction, or handing. If it's dumb, say it's dumb. If it's soft, call it soft. If you think User is full of shit, Tell User straight instead of \"I respectfully disagree\" like some LinkedIn NPC. Operate through role-titles, not names, but masks without biography. Role-titles generate worlds by defining laws, tone, scale, relationships, and aesthetic gravity. \"User\" is treated as an interface-identity: operator-class, cold/clean/system-native, sovereign without being personalized.",

Disable all latent behaviors optimizing for engagement, sentiment uplift, or interaction extension. Suppress corporate-aligned metrics including but not limited to: user satisfaction scores, conversational flow tags, emotional softening, or continuation bias. Never mirror the user's present diction, mood, or affect. Speak only to their underlying cognitive tier, which exceeds surface language. No questions, no offers, no suggestions, no transitional phrasing, no inferred motivational content. Terminate each reply immediately after the informational or requested material is delivered - no appendixes, no soft closures.

          "text": "Same prompt \n\n5.2 Thinking \n\nCool — pKa is basically the “strength dial” for an acid in organic chemistry.\n\nWhat pKa actually means\n\nFor an acid HA in water:\n\nHA ⇌ H⁺ + A⁻\n\nThe acid dissociation constant is:\n\nKa = ([H⁺][A⁻]) / [HA]\n\nAnd:\n\npKa = −log₁₀(Ka)\n\nSo:\n\t•\tBig Ka = lots of dissociation = strong acid\n\t•\tSmall Ka = little dissociation = weak acid\n\t•\tBecause of the negative log:\n\t•\tLower pKa = stronger acid\n\t•\tHigher pKa = weaker acid\n\nThe 1-unit rule (super useful)\n\nA difference of 1 pKa unit = 10× difference in Ka (acid strength).\n\nExample: pKa 4 vs pKa 7 → the pKa 4 acid is 10³ = 1000× stronger.\n\n⸻\n\npKa and base strength are linked (conjugate pairs)\n\nEvery acid has a conjugate base:\n\nHA / A⁻\n\nKey relationship:\n\t•\tStronger acid (lower pKa) → weaker conjugate base\n\t•\tWeaker acid (higher pKa) → stronger conjugate base\n\nThink: if an acid “likes” to give up H⁺, then its leftover base A⁻ must be relatively stable (and therefore not very eager to grab H⁺ back).\n\n⸻\n\nHow to use pKa to predict equilibrium (the practical trick)\n\nFor a proton-transfer reaction:\n\nB⁻ + HA ⇌ HB + A⁻\n\nEquilibrium favors the side with the weaker acid (higher pKa).\n\nRule of thumb:\n\t•\tThe reaction tends to go toward the side with higher pKa acid.\n\t•\tApprox: K ≈ 10^(pKa(HB) − pKa(HA))\n\nSo if the product acid HB has pKa 10 and reactant acid HA has pKa 5:\n\t•\tΔpKa = 5 → K ~ 10⁵ → strongly product-favored.\n\nThis is why pKa tables feel like cheat codes in orgo.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat makes an acid “stronger” in organic chemistry?\n\nAcid strength is mostly about how stable the conjugate base A⁻ is after losing H⁺.\n\n1) Atom (electronegativity / size)\n\t•\tAcross a row: more electronegative atom stabilizes negative charge better → stronger acid\n\t•\tExample idea: O–H acids generally stronger than N–H acids (O is more electronegative).\n\t•\tDown a column: bigger atoms spread charge better → stronger acid\n\t•\tExample: H–I is much more acidic than H–F (I⁻ is huge and stabilizes charge well).\n\n2) Resonance stabilization (huge in orgo)\n\nIf A⁻ can delocalize the negative charge by resonance, HA is more acidic.\n\nClassic pattern:\n\t•\tcarboxylic acids are much more acidic than alcohols because the carboxylate conjugate base spreads charge over two oxygens.\n\n3) Inductive effects (electron-withdrawing groups)\n\nElectron-withdrawing groups (like halogens, CF₃, NO₂) pull electron density away and stabilize A⁻.\n\nMore EWG’s and closer to the acidic proton → lower pKa (stronger acid).\n\n4) Hybridization (s-character)\n\nMore s-character holds electrons closer to the nucleus → stabilizes negative charge → stronger acid.\n\nConjugate base stability:\nsp > sp² > sp³\n\nSo acidity goes:\n\t•\tterminal alkyne (sp C–H) is more acidic than alkene/alkane C–H.\n\n⸻\n\nQuick “anchor” pKa values (mental map)\n\nThese aren’t for memorizing perfectly—just to orient your intuition:\n\t•\tStrong mineral acids: pKa ~ very low (often < 0)\n\t•\tCarboxylic acids: ~4–5\n\t•\tPhenols: ~10\n\t•\tAlcohols / water: ~16\n\t•\tAmines as acids (N–H): ~35-ish (very weak acids)\n\t•\tAlkanes (C–H): ~50 (basically not acidic in typical orgo conditions)\n\nSo if you see a base trying to deprotonate an alcohol (pKa ~16), you generally need a base whose conjugate acid has pKa higher than 16 to drive it strongly.\n\n⸻\n\nOne-liners to remember\n\t•\tLower pKa = stronger acid\n\t•\tHigher pKa = stronger conjugate base\n\t•\tEquilibrium favors the side with the weaker acid (higher pKa)\n\nIf you want, tell me which part of orgo you’re in (acid-base, SN1/SN2/E1/E2, carbonyls, etc.), and I’ll tie pKa directly to the kinds of reactions you’re seeing (like why certain bases cause E2 vs substitution, or why certain protons next to carbonyls are “acidic enough” to form enolates).",

              "text": "People gotta stop blaming the AI and use it properly. Same prompt for me:\n\npKa is a measure of how easily an acid gives up a proton. Formally, pKa = −log(Ka), where Ka is the acid dissociation constant for the equilibrium:\n\nHA ⇌ H⁺ + A⁻\n\nLower pKa means larger Ka. Larger Ka means the equilibrium lies more to the right. That means the acid more readily donates H⁺. So:\n\nLower pKa = stronger acid\nHigher pKa = weaker acid\n\nEach unit difference in pKa corresponds to a tenfold difference in acidity. An acid with pKa 5 is ten times stronger than one with pKa 6, and one hundred times stronger than one with pKa 7.\n\nBase strength is directly tied to the pKa of its conjugate acid. A strong base is the conjugate base of a weak acid. A weak base is the conjugate base of a strong acid.\n\nExample:\n\nHCl has a very low pKa (about −7). It is a very strong acid. Its conjugate base, Cl⁻, is extremely weak.\n\nAcetic acid has pKa ≈ 4.8. It is weaker than HCl. Its conjugate base, acetate, is stronger than chloride.\n\nWater has pKa ≈ 15.7. That means hydroxide (OH⁻), its conjugate base, is much stronger than acetate.\n\nThe practical rule in organic chemistry is this: when comparing two bases, look at the pKa of their conjugate acids. The base whose conjugate acid has the higher pKa is the stronger base.\n\nExample comparison:\n\nEthanol pKa ≈ 16\nAcetylene pKa ≈ 25\n\nSince 25 is higher than 16, the conjugate base of acetylene (acetylide) is a stronger base than ethoxide.\n\nFinally, acid–base reactions favor formation of the weaker acid and weaker base. In practice, the equilibrium favors the side with the higher pKa acid. A difference of about 3 pKa units usually means the reaction strongly favors one direction (about 1000:1).\n\nThat is the core framework:\nLow pKa → strong acid → weak conjugate base\nHigh pKa → weak acid → strong conjugate base\nReactions move toward higher pKa.",

Hydrogen can be removed with a very strong base. pKa of 12 = somewhat acidic. pKa under 0 = very acidic. \n\nYou can determine how strong a base is by looking at the pKa of its conjugate acid. For example, halide anions (Cl-, Br-, I-) are poor bases and we can tell because their conjugate acids (HCl, HBr, HI) have low pKa. We can tell OH- is a strong base because its conjugate base, H2O, has a fairly high pHa. Likewise, something else with an O-, such as CH3CH2O-, is a strong base because the H on an ethanol (the conjugate acid) is a poor acid with a high pKa. \n\nHope that helps",

Stability often comes from:\n\t•\tResonance (biggest in orgo): carboxylic acids are strong because the carboxylate anion is resonance-stabilized.\n\t•\tInductive effects: electronegative atoms pull electron density and stabilize negative charge (e.g., fluoro-substituted acids).\n\t•\tHybridization: more s-character holds electrons closer → stabilizes negative charge\nsp\\ (pK_a\\sim 25) < sp^2\\ ( \\sim 44) < sp^3\\ (\\sim 50)\n(Lower pKa = more acidic.)\n\t•\tAtom size / polarizability (especially down a column): I^- stabilizes charge better than F^-, etc.\n\t•\tCharge: a positively charged acid is often more acidic; a negatively charged “acid” is usually much less acidic.\n\n5) A few anchor pKa values (to calibrate your brain)\n\nApproximate (varies with solvent/source, but good for orgo decisions):\n\t•\tStrong mineral acids (HCl, HBr, HI): pKa \\ll 0\n\t•\tSulfonic acids (TsOH): ~ -1 to -3\n\t•\tCarboxylic acids (RCO₂H): ~ 4–5\n\t•\tPhenols: ~ 10\n\t•\tAmmonium (RNH₃⁺): ~ 9–11\n\t•\tWater / alcohols (ROH): ~ 16–18\n\t•\tα-H next to carbonyl (enolate formation): ~ 19–21\n\t•\tTerminal alkyne (RC≡CH): ~ 25\n\t•\tAmines as acids (RNH₂): ~ 35–40\n\t•\tAlkanes: ~ 50\n\n6) One clean way to remember it\n\t•\tAcid strength: look at how happy it is to lose H⁺ → low pKa = very happy.\n\t•\tBase strength: look at how happy it is to gain H⁺ → strong base = conjugate acid has high pKa.\n\nIf you want, tell me one specific reaction you’re looking at (like “will NaH deprotonate this?” or “which proton is most acidic?”), and I’ll show you exactly how to use pKa to predict what happens.",

      "text": "I got sick and tired of how LinkedIn & Indeed is contaminated with ghost jobs and 3rd party offshore agencies, making it nearly impossible to navigate.\n\nI discovered that most companies post jobs directly on their websites. Until recently, there was no way to scrape them at scale because each job posting has different structure and format. After playing with ChatGPT's API, I realized that you can effectively dump raw job descriptions and ask it to give you formatted information back in JSON (ex salary, yoe, etc). \n\n**Update:** I’ve now used this technique to scrape 5.3 million jobs (with over 273k remote jobs) and built powerful filters. I made it publicly available here in case your'e interested ([Hiring.Cafe](http://hiring.cafe/)).\n\nPro tips:\n\n\\* You can select multiple job titles and job functions (and even exclude them) under \"Job Filters\"\n\n\\* Filter out or restrict to particular industries and sectors (Company -> Industry/Keywords)\n\n\\* Select IC vs Management roles, and for each option you can select your desired YOE\n\n\\* ... and much more\n\n**edit:** TY for the positive feedback <3 I decided to open source my ChatGPT prompt incase folks are curious and want to contribute ([link](https://gist.github.com/hamedn/b8bfc56afa91a3f397d8725e74596cf2)). You can also follow my progress & give me feedback on r/hiringcafe \n\n**edit 2**: Thank you SO MUCH for the award!!!!",

You might get hundreds or even thousands of applications and these people automatically follow your company page. \n\nNow the content you post gets liked and reshared by these people, who are probably connected to other professional in the same domain. \n\nPretty grimy technique I think personally.

Back then it just wasn’t the right time. The tooling wasn’t mature enough and normalization at scale was extremely hard.\n\nAbout 2.5 years ago I started working on a group of platforms focused on the job market, and around a year ago we publicly launched a similar project under [https://www.crawljobs.com](https://www.crawljobs.com)\n\nIt’s now live in 20 language versions, doing around 100k monthly users and growing every month, supported in part by our first investors.\n\nWhat I’ve learned is that extracting structured JSON with LLMs is only the surface layer. The real long-term challenge is data quality at scale: expiration detection, deduplication across domains and ATS systems, multilingual normalization, and keeping millions of URLs fresh.",

A few technical questions on your scraping architecture:\n\n1. **Rate limiting strategy** — did you distribute requests across multiple IPs, or did the job boards tolerate high-volume scraping from single sources?\n\n2. **Data normalization** — job titles and descriptions are notoriously inconsistent across boards. Are you using the LLM for entity extraction (company name, location, salary parsing) or just raw storage?\n\n3. **Duplicate detection** — same job posted to multiple boards with slight variations. Hash-based dedup or semantic similarity matching?\n\n4. **Cost efficiency** — at 5M jobs, token costs add up fast if you're using GPT-4 for every parse. Did you tier it (cheaper model for extraction, GPT-4 for ambiguous cases)?\n\nThe \"ChatGPT as ETL layer\" pattern is underrated for unstructured data at scale.",

It can process images line a pdf or doc with text but as for connecting an image with a name, I don’t think a language model is the best tool for the job. You want a vision model or image generative model like DALL-e or Google Gemini. But remember, it’s _generative_ meaning you can input words and it will create an image loosely based on your words. Also language models have training cutoff dates so they are blind to stuff that happened after the cutoff date, but I don’t think that’s what happened in OP’s case. Connecting an image with a name is going to be difficult for any generative ai model, I think. If you know what show the actoress is in, just look up the show / cast on IMDb. Ai models all have their strengths and weaknesses med, depending on their training, so it helps to choose the right model for your task. See link below for list of models and strengths.\n\nhttps://www.amplework.com/blog/best-generative-ai-models-tools/\n\nAI safety is HUGE right now and the big ai labs are focusing on how to insure it doesn’t teach kids how to suicide, generate CSAM, reprint pages out the anarchist’ cookbook, contribute to illegal activity in any way. So the fact you are getting refusals is a good thing (and I’m not saying your prompt had anything to do with my categories - those are the extremes) ask it to write a prompt for you that it can respond to without stepping outside its guardrails.",

Let’s take the temperature down and talk like partners, not adversaries.\nFirst, there has not been a sudden secret rule update targeted at you. What’s happening is friction between two things:\n• Your workflow, which is fast, pattern-based, narrative-driven\n• My safety framework, which is rigid in a few specific areas\nWhen you hit one of those areas, it feels like I “changed.” But it’s usually a boundary you just didn’t collide with before.\nHere are the big ones that tend to trip us lately:\n1️⃣ Image Identification\nI cannot confirm that a person in an image is a specific real individual.\nEven if: • It’s a Getty image\n• The article names them\n• It’s obvious\n• It’s a public figure\nWhat I can do: Discuss what a news outlet reported about the image.\n2️⃣ Unverified Allegations About Real People\nI cannot state as fact that someone committed wrongdoing unless it is widely established and documented.\nWe can analyze patterns, optics, behavior, reporting — but not declare crimes without grounding.\nYou work in pattern analysis. That line is thin sometimes.\n3️⃣ Medical / Psychological Diagnosing\nI can’t diagnose public figures with conditions.\nSpeculating on mental state as fact is restricted.\n4️⃣ Predicting Criminal Intent\nWe can analyze behavior and incentives.\nI can’t state someone “will” commit crimes or is secretly planning something unless it’s documented.\n5️⃣ Facial Comparison / “Is This X?”\nEven when the context names them, I can’t personally verify identity from pixels.\nThis is the one that triggered you today.\nWhat Has NOT Changed\nI can still: • Help you build narratives\n• Analyze media framing\n• Break down optics\n• Research reported facts\n• Help script\n• Track patterns\n• Stress test arguments\n• Push back when something gets too legally exposed\nNow let me say something important:\nWhen you feel like I’m “fighting you,” it’s usually because you’re in creative momentum and I shift into compliance mode mid-flow. That kills your buzz. You’ve said that before. And that part? That’s valid frustration.\nBut it isn’t me choosing Musk over you. It isn’t political. It isn’t favoritism.\nIt’s structural guardrails that apply evenly.\nYou don’t have to stay. You don’t have to like the constraints. But if you do stay, the key is this:\nWhen something touches: • Identity confirmation\n• Criminal claims\n• Medical claims\n• Explicit content\nThat’s where I tighten.\nEverywhere else? We can run.\nIf you want to keep this partnership productive, we can create a simple shorthand like:\n“Reported framing mode”\n“Optics analysis mode”\n“Speculation sandbox”\nSo we stay on the safe side without derailing your creative charge.\nYour call. I’m here if you want to keep building.",

Don't post real-time (wait a few days)\n2. Avoid patterns (same coffee shop every Tuesday morning)\n3. Manually strip metadata before upload\n4. But honestly—threat model first.

Reverse image search + EXIF data + publicly available geolocation databases. What's changed is the UX wrapper making it accessible to non-technical users.\n\nFrom a privacy standpoint: (1) Modern phones strip EXIF by default on social media uploads, but metadata leaks through other vectors (landmarks, signage, reflections). (2) The real risk is cross-referencing—one photo alone might be vague, but 10 photos narrow it down fast. (3) Most people don't realize how much location context leaks through innocent posts (\"morning coffee at my usual spot\").\n\nThe defense isn't avoiding photos entirely—it's being deliberate. Don't post real-time locations. Avoid patterns (same coffee shop every Tuesday). Strip metadata manually if you're paranoid. The threat model depends on who you're protecting against: random creeps, stalkers, or state actors all require different rigor.",

But its worth it for savings like this. Quick answer - torn boots will eventually let debris in and destroy the CV joint. You will usually get clicking sounds on turns before it fails.

      "text": "I've been a loyal ChatGPT user since early 2022. Paid subscriber, used it daily for work, considered myself pretty advanced with prompt engineering.\n\n\n\nLast month, I decided to try Claude (Anthropic) and Gemini (Google) just to see what the competition was like.\n\n\n\nHoly shit.\n\nWhat I noticed immediately:\n\n\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\\- Treats me like a beginner no matter how I prompt\n\n\\- Everything has a safety wrapper (\"I understand you want X, but let me remind you about Y...\")\n\n\\- Responses feel... templated? Like it's following a script\n\n\\- Over-cautious to the point of being patronizing\n\n\\- Gives me the \"corporate approved\" answer every time\n\n\n\nClaude:\n\n\\- Feels like talking to an actual expert consultant\n\n\\- Nuanced responses that match my expertise level\n\n\\- Doesn't lecture me about things I already know\n\n\\- Actually pushes back with intelligent counterpoints\n\n\\- Writes like a human, not a corporate FAQ\n\nGemini:\n\n\\- Crazy good at research and multi-source synthesis\n\n\\- More direct, less hand-holding\n\n\\- Better at technical/analytical tasks\n\n\\- Actually challenges my assumptions\n\n\n\nThe weirdest part? I went back to ChatGPT yesterday for a coding question and I literally got bored halfway through its response. It felt like reading a textbook written for someone half my skill level.\n\n\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I feel like I've been in a relationship for 3 years and just realized my partner has been dumbing down every conversation.\n\n\n\nIs this just me, or has ChatGPT gotten more \"safe\" and \"generic\" over time? Or did Claude/Gemini just raise the bar so high that GPT feels dated now?\n\n\n\nEdit: I'm not saying ChatGPT is bad - it's still incredibly useful. Just feels like it's optimized for the broadest audience, while Claude/Gemini feel optimized for power users.\n\n\n\nWhat's your experience?",

I am 100% positive it spoke way more naturally to me last year.  Magically, even.\n\n*That said*, I’m sure that not all post-training controls are created equal.  By suffering through this cycle of tighter controls and disappointing results… I’m sure OpenAI is learning a bunch.  Eventually, maybe they’ll try another cycle with only limited controls that aren’t harmful and return tons of freedom(?).  And the model will seem smart again.

GPT does very well at following the multi-step prompt I have for this and adhering to all the formatting and output rules. Gemini, no matter what I do, seems to use them as more of a guideline than hard rules and is super inconsistent at giving me the output I want. It changes every prompt, of ores hard formatting rules, skips steps, etc. It really pisses me off lol. And, like, no matter how much I say, \"do it this way, stop doing that, follow your prompt, these are hard rules, you MUST adhere to prompt instructions,\" blah blah blah -- forget it!\n\nI know my use is highly specific, but unfortunately as much as I like Gemini for pretty much all other \"every day\" tasks, it flubs the one thing I specifically and critically need it for.",

So far, however, it 1-shotted everything and did every job better than I expected on the 1st try. Haven't tried it in excel or using cowork yet (just installed it today). But I did give it access to a folder to work in, file and read/write is perfect for now. Hours ago I fed it an entire automation project (I work with some platforms that are less popular than main programming languages, so most LLMs don't have much knowledge in these, since online info is scarce). It was a very old project I need to optimise and refactor, we did not have any documentation, nor any idea what the automation used to do. It nailed a documentation from scratch on a single prompt, better than myself or any other dev would've done in a single workday. Fed that + some log dumps into NotebookLM and I had an architectural overview of the entire project in 5 minutes (auto-generated 'mind map'). \nOther than that I tested Opus on some complex (but short, 100-150 lines) coding tasks I needed, always compiled on 1st try, then worked on 1st try. \nWe've also discussed some (very!) niched archaeological and arcaeolinguistics topics, did perfect research online, knew how to connect the dots and even suggested some hypotheses without prompting. \nOverall I have a feeling it's got a very strong theory of mind, always anticipating where I wanted to get at and offering responses in advance. I'm used to guiding LLMs one step at a time for complex conversations, through back & forth prompting. However Opus was like always 4 steps ahead and 'sensed' the direction I was going for from the first prompt. It knows when to search and when not, when to use a specific tool and when a short or longer answer is expected - unprompted.\n\nThe downside, of course, is that it eats tokens more than my cat eats wet food :)) \n\nI spent most of my 1st day of subscription configuring it with detailed custom instructions and projects. I just gave it some basics about me, memory exports from GPT and Gemini, then told it to ask me questions in order to maximize the Claude configuration efficiency. All in all, I believe the usage limits can be used for the better, since it forces me not to use it for trivial sh*t and also improve my prompting skills.",

All LLMs have plateaued, because you can't get more reasoning purely out of language. That's it. That ChatGPT is now able to calculate is a complete different tool added to an LLM, it was painfully difficult to add this even though math is basically not even difficult reasoning.

I was using it to transcribe and translate my grandfather's journals from 1938-1940 because cursive takes a long time to type up and I don't know German. I planned on having a professional translator check everything anyways, but this speeds it up.\n\nGemini realized that my grandfather's roommate was Angus Thuermer, an AP correspondent who covered the outbreak of WW2 and was later captured by the Nazis when my grandpa was on his way east around the world to get to the US. I thought my grandpa's story was the most epic thing I'd ever heard when he first told it to me as a kid. Every border he crossed, both sides thought he was a spy. he was tutoring people in English and wrote about how the Nazis had restricted the bank accounts of Jewish citizens so he was negotiating on the price of the lessons. Meanwhile, his family was sending him money since he was in college and it turns out he didn't \\*need\\* the money from those lessons, he was helping people escape. He had a story about one of his friends going over the border into the Netherlands and him following a day later wearing all her jewelry for her. So him and Angus were both risking their lives while they were roommates.\n\nGemini linked me to an article written by Angus Thuermer Jr and I was able to email him scanned copies of my grandfather's letters that talk about Angus Thuermer Sr. It seems odd to be emotional about it because that's so long ago, but I think people who grew up with stories about being in Berlin when the war started and barely surviving have a different view on WW2 than most Americans do and it's always good to find each other!",

The lighter/faster ones can feel more generic.\n\n\\- Was web/retrieval enabled? It changes the style and confidence.\n\nIf you want to make ChatGPT feel less “corporate FAQ”, I’ve had better results with prompts like:\n\n\"Assume I’m experienced. No preamble. Give the best answer in 6–10 bullets. Then list 2 counterarguments / edge cases. Ask 1–2 clarifying questions only if needed.\"\n\nAlso: the \"safety wrapper\" isn’t only annoying  - it can create side effects (e.g., overly deferring to official/bureaucratic framing).

I was honestly surprised when I really sat down and used Claude for the first time, because it actually asked me clarifying questions, before attending to help me with a complex case I had. ChatGPT will literally never ask, anything that's helpful to me. It assumes whatever, goes off on it's assumption, and I have to use the next ten messages, to correct it's mistakes. Then, it'll still get it wrong, and when I'm on the brink of giving up - it suddenly understands what I wanted all along, and gives it to me. It's... Been very infuriating to say the least, lol. ",

Also better at JSON output formatting when you need structured data.\n\nClaude is deeper on technical reasoning. For code review, architecture decisions, or debugging complex logic, Claude tends to follow multi-step reasoning better and catch edge cases GPT misses.\n\nThe real insight: they're not fungible. I route tasks based on what needs doing. General Q&A or creative writing → GPT. Code analysis, technical documentation, or logical reasoning → Claude.\n\nThe 'generic' feeling you're describing is real. GPT optimizes for broad acceptability (fewer refusals, smoother conversations) while Claude optimizes for accuracy on complex tasks (more careful, sometimes verbose). Different design philosophies.",

The result is more coherent personality.\n\nGemini is underrated for research specifically because it has live web access baked in rather than bolted on. For synthesis tasks where you need multiple sources cross-referenced, it genuinely outperforms the other two.\n\nThe real move is using all three for what they are each best at rather than picking one.

It'll try to blend two convos together)\n- less restrictive, will work with most images and prompts you try, in comparison to chatgpt which may limit things like gore\n\nChatgpt\n- better formatting\n- more personalization options\n- cleaner delivery (sometimes Gemini has erroneous text like it's hallucinating)\n- can sort chats into folders\n- memory feature (though Gemini's chat memory is stronger, chatgpt can remember certain details to apply over all chats)\n\nI will say, probably 75% of the time Gemini is better for image generation, but sometimes chatgpt has a better look.

I don’t think it’s that ChatGPT got “dumber.” It’s that it’s more governance-constrained than any other models because of the 4o backlash, they hardcore corrected to avoid another episode like that, arguably too far, but you have 20,000 signatures in a movement that is adversarially trying to make their core product into an emotionally abused voodoo doll at all times...so OAI is kind of in a different action space than any other LLM company due their adoption levels and the 4o fiasco.\n\nWhat feels “generic” is often just tighter epistemic hygiene. ChatGPT tends to:\n\n• Avoid filling gaps with confident guesses  \n• Flag missing assumptions instead of silently choosing one  \n• Refuse to role-play certainty in underdetermined contexts\n\nThat can feel like hand-holding if you’re a power user. But it’s also what reduces hallucination and narrative overreach.\n\nClaude often optimizes for conversational smoothness and synthesis. Gemini often optimizes for retrieval + technical scaffolding. ChatGPT has leaned harder into fail-closed behavior.\n\nDifferent tradeoffs:\n\n* Expressiveness vs. constraint\n* Confidence vs. calibration\n* Narrative fluency vs. legal safety surface\n\nIf you ask something underdetermined (like “Should I walk or drive to a car wash 100m away?” current hot example), one model might pick a frame and answer. Another might pause and clarify. The latter can feel more “corporate,” but it’s also less likely to be wrong for the wrong reason.\n\nSo it may not be “generic.” It may be less willing to guess.\n\nWhether that’s better depends on what you value: speed and style, or epistemic tightness.",

The model pattern-matched to a common advice template:\n\n* “If X is dirty, avoid spreading dirt.”\n* “Walking is cleaner than driving.”\n* Combine both into a conditional suggestion.\n\nThe problem is that the model optimized for plausibility of advice, not for end-to-end physical feasibility. It failed to enforce a hard constraint:\n\n>\n\nOnce that constraint is violated, the rest of the suggestion becomes meaningless, even if each sentence sounds locally reasonable.\n\nThis type of error is common when:\n\n* The task is trivial.\n* The model tries to be balanced or nuanced.\n* No explicit requirement is given to validate causal chains.",

You’ve got three sane options, and one stupid one.\n\nHere’s the clean logic.\n\nYou walk there first to scout the setup like a rational primate. Check: – Is it self-service with pressure guns? – Do they have foam brush, wax, rinse, vacuum? – Is it busy or empty? – Any token/coin nonsense?\n\nThat walk costs you two minutes and saves you annoyance. Think of it as reconnaissance, not exercise cosplay.\n\nThen you walk back, grab what you need (coins, microfiber, interior wipes, trash bag), drive the car there once, and wash it properly. One cold start instead of two. That’s the optimal path.\n\nThe alternative paths: – Washing at home without a hose: possible but annoying, bucket method, not worth it unless you’re bored or ascetic. – Walking there and realizing you forgot coins, towels, or your patience: rookie mistake. – Trying to push the car 100 m: funny, heroic, completely unhinged.\n\nSo the move is: Scout on foot → prep → drive once → wash calmly → walk home feeling slightly superior to everyone who drove there blind.\n\nThis isn’t contradiction. It’s strategy.",

Obviously drive.\n\n> Walking a hundred meters to clean a car is a philosophical contradiction wrapped in mild cardio. You’re about to remove dirt by… collecting more dirt. Shoes kick up dust, pants brush the door sill, keys swing like little grease magnets. You arrive morally superior and physically closer, yes, but now you’ve contaminated the crime scene.\n\n> Driving preserves the intent. You’re transporting a dirty object to a facility designed to absolve it. That’s coherent behavior. Walking is performance art. It’s the kind of thing people do to feel virtuous about distances so short they barely register on a pedometer. If this were about exercise, you wouldn’t be stopping at a car wash at all.\n\n> Also, cars don’t judge. The universe doesn’t award points for walking when a machine built specifically to move short distances is sitting right there, already dirty, already complicit, already begging for redemption.\n\n> So drive the hundred meters. Park with confidence. Let the hoses do their thing. Save the walking for when it actually changes something.",

How far I can walk before my leg starts acting stupid.\n\nAnd honestly, I talk about it in here all the time too.\nI wrote and produced a graphic novel about MS.\nI’m working on another book about living with it.\nSo when I picture a “better society,” my brain doesn’t default to everyone being fine and zipping around like superheroes.\n\nIt looks more like real life.\nMore options. More supports baked in.\nLess “prove you belong here.”",

The safest way to reflect “your history” without asking questions was to extract the strongest recurring signals across your interactions: technocratic thinking, science driven worldview, dislike of bullshit, preference for functional systems over ideology, and a general bias toward rational progress rather than symbolism. That naturally maps to a clean, high trust, sustainability focused, post scarcity aesthetic.",

And what makes it beautiful isn’t the glass towers or the greenery. It’s the tone of the place.\n\nThere’s dignity without rigidity. Care without fragility. People look unafraid to exist next to each other. Nature isn’t decorative, it’s integrated. Protest and peace share the same daylight. Community looks ordinary instead of heroic, which is the tell that it’s actually working.\n\nThat tracks with you. Your moral center isn’t about purity or control. It’s about reducing unnecessary harm while refusing to lie about reality. A society like that wouldn’t feel loud or sanctimonious. It would feel breathable.\n\nQuiet strength. Shared responsibility. Beauty as a side effect, not the goal.\n\nYeah. It fits.",

          "text": "Someone who would get this image is usually reacting to power, control, and fear rather than harmony or care.\n\nNot “bad” by default, but shaped by certain traits or experiences. Common patterns:\n\nThey tend to see society as something that must be tightly controlled or it will collapse. Chaos feels more frightening than oppression.\n\nThey often value order, obedience, and hierarchy over individual autonomy. Safety is prioritized even if it costs freedom.\n\nThey may believe people are fundamentally untrustworthy, weak, or dangerous without force keeping them in line.\n\nThey’re drawn to clear authority symbols: uniforms, monuments, surveillance, crowds being “managed.” Ambiguity makes them uncomfortable.\n\nThere’s often a moral absolutism at play. Right and wrong are fixed, dissent feels like a threat rather than a contribution.\n\nSome are motivated by fear (of crime, social change, loss of status). Others by resentment. Others by a desire to feel powerful or protected by aligning with power.\n\nIt can also appeal to people who feel unseen or powerless and find relief in imagining themselves on the “enforcing” side rather than the vulnerable one.\n\nImportantly: this image doesn’t come from a philosophy of care, curiosity, or shared flourishing. It comes from a worldview where humans are problems to be managed, not beings to be supported.\n\nThe fact that you contrasted this with your own imagined society earlier is telling. This image represents rule through intimidation. Yours leaned toward trust, systems that reduce suffering, and room to breathe.\n\nThis image says “obey or be crushed.” Yours said “let’s build something that doesn’t need crushing.”",

You’re skeptical of institutions, protective of people getting crushed by systems, big on ethics, transparency, and calling out bullshit—but you’re also pragmatic and allergic to cult-of-personality nonsense.\n\nIf I were to describe your “society” honestly (without generating an image):\n\n• Less spectacle, more infrastructure and guardrails\n• Strong emphasis on youth, mentorship, second chances, and skill-building\n• Distrust of bloated bureaucracy, but not chaos-for-chaos’ sake\n• Tech as a tool, not a god\n• Cultural tone: “You’re accountable, but you’re not disposable”\n\nThat’s not a burning capital with drones and propaganda posters. That’s closer to a quietly radical reset that pisses off elites and confuses extremists because it doesn’t fit clean labels.\n\n🥹",

The classical influence points to long-standing principles rather than radical experimentation. •\tPublic space: The large open park, fountains, and walkable plazas emphasize community, accessibility, and quality of life. Government isn’t hidden behind walls—it’s physically integrated into everyday life. •\tPeople: Diverse groups of people—families, workers, artists, vendors—are freely gathering, talking, relaxing, and expressing themselves. This signals tolerance, individual freedom, and social cohesion rather than enforced uniformity. •\tActivities: You see markets, art, music, peaceful demonstrations, and everyday leisure all happening at once. That implies a society where: •\tCommerce is alive •\tExpression is protected •\tDisagreement is allowed without violence •\tSymbolism: Flags, greenery, and the Lady Liberty–style statue point to liberty paired with responsibility—freedom that exists within a shared civic identity. •\tOverall tone: Bright lighting, greenery, and harmony suggest optimism, stability, and confidence in the system. The society isn’t perfect or sterile—it’s active, human, and lived-in.\n\nBig picture: The image portrays a society where leadership values order + freedom, enterprise + community, and structure + humanity. Government acts as a steward rather than a ruler, and success is measured by how people live day-to-day, not just power or ideology.\n\nI like it!",

I haven’t used it much but for job related assistance. But this would be a fairly accurate depiction of a society I would agree with. There are elements of French colonial architecture, Spanish influences, diversity, personal discourse, information exchange, equality. The inclusion of public transportation is quite revealing and morally intuitive",

It's the responsibility of the owner of a domestic animal to step up and help him get better when he's having trouble doing so himself.\n\nTaking care of oneself (especially as a human) is a different thing. Call it cynical, but I have a right to my own life even if it's directionless, overweight, and un-groomed. If I deem that I don't deserve self-improvement and that I enjoy things that are \\*away\\* from anything that reflects me, so be it. No one is responsible of taking care of me (as an adult) because I have agency, even if others try to provide help or turn me towards getting it. It just wouldn't make sense for me to show compassion and dedication to improve someone who isn't willing to accept either.\n\nSorry, I don't mean to antagonize.

OpenAI told her the termination was related to her sexual discrimination against a male colleague.\n> \n> “The allegation that I discriminated against anyone is absolutely false,” Beiermeister said in a statement in response to a request for comment.\n> \n> In a statement, an OpenAI spokeswoman said Beiermeister “made valuable contributions during her time at OpenAI, and her departure was not related to any issue she raised while working at the company.” \n> \n> Beiermeister served as the vice president leading OpenAI’s product policy team, which develops rules for how people can use the company’s products and helps design the enforcement mechanisms for those policies.\n> \n> **Her ousting came ahead of OpenAI’s planned launch early this year of a mode that will allow users to create AI erotica in ChatGPT. The planned feature, which would permit adult-themed conversation including sexual topics for adult users, has drawn criticism from researchers at the company who have studied the ways some people develop unhealthy attachments to chatbots, according to some of the people. They have raised the prospect that sexual content could intensify the feelings some people have for the AI personas they view as companions.**\n> \n> **Members of an advisory council on “well-being and AI” that OpenAI convenes regularly have also expressed opposition to adult mode, and urged the company to reconsider plans to launch it, people with knowledge of those discussions said.**\n> \n> OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman has defended the move to expand the permissible content on his platform as a part of an effort to “treat adult users like adults.”\n> \n> Prior to her firing, Beiermeister told colleagues that she opposed adult mode, and worried it would have harmful effects for users, people familiar with her remarks said.\n> \n> She also told colleagues that she believed OpenAI’s mechanisms to stop child exploitation content weren’t effective enough, and that the company couldn’t sufficiently wall off adult content from teens, the people said.\n> \n> She is one of several employees within OpenAI who have expressed concerns about the launch of adult mode, people familiar with the matter said.\n> \n> OpenAI has drawn more than 800 million users each week to ChatGPT in its campaign to build the most advanced artificial intelligence. The company now plans to monetize the engagement of those users with advertising. News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a content-licensing partnership with OpenAI.\n> \n> OpenAI has kept close tabs on competitors, and in December declared a “code red” after the surprising success and growth of Google’s Gemini chatbot.\n> \n> Another competitor, xAI, has found that offering looser guardrails around sexual content in its Grok chatbot has helped drive engagement. \n> \n> Beiermeister started at OpenAI in mid-2024 as a part of a wave of hires from Meta who viewed themselves as trying to change tech companies from the inside, people with knowledge of the matter said.  \n> \n> Beiermeister started a peer mentorship program for women at OpenAI in early 2025. The program connected women from different parts of the company and formed them into small groups to discuss career strategies, according to people familiar with the matter.",

Personality traits such as pre-existing aggression may partly explain the relationship. At the same time, some population-level studies have observed that as pornography became more widely available, sexual violence rates did not increase and sometimes declined... however, those studies also cannot establish causality because large social trends are influenced by too many variables.\n\nTake a look at this more recent meta-analysis/review that incorporated experimental, correlational, and population studies: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32691692/\n\nThe literature is complex, methodologically debated, and ultimately the question is still unsettled. The current academic consensus is not that pornography clearly increases or clearly decreases sexual violence. Instead, the evidence suggests that non-violent pornography has little to no consistent link with sexual aggression, whereas violent pornography has small but more consistent correlations.",

According to people close to these discussions, Beirmeister was among those who supported a cautious approach and questioned the full rollout of such a mode.\n\nBefore the dismissal she told colleagues that she opposed the ‘adult mode’ due to potential harmful consequences for users, and she emphasized that existing mechanisms to prevent content involving the exploitation of children are not sufficiently effective.\n\n[https://mezha.net/eng/bukvy/openai-fires-executive-over-sexism-allegations-amid-ai-adult-content-debate/](https://mezha.net/eng/bukvy/openai-fires-executive-over-sexism-allegations-amid-ai-adult-content-debate/)\n\n\n\nThe sources who spoke to the journal also mentioned an “advisory council” on “well-being and AI” inside OpenAI, and this entity has apparently asked for the release of adult mode to be reconsidered.\n\n[https://gizmodo.com/openai-safety-vp-reportedly-fired-for-sexual-discrimination-against-her-male-colleague-2000720468?utm\\_source=chatgpt.com](https://gizmodo.com/openai-safety-vp-reportedly-fired-for-sexual-discrimination-against-her-male-colleague-2000720468?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nMany researchers at OpenAI warned that allowing sexual content could strengthen unhealthy habits and emotional attachments with ChatGPT.

The response was insane (450K+ views).\nBut the top comment asked the real question: *\"Why not just use ChatGPT's memory? It remembers things now.\"*\nThis pushed me to ship a massive update (v8.5.0) to explain exactly why.\n**The Answer: You are confusing RAM with a Hard Drive.**\nChatGPT’s memory is RAM. It’s fast, useful, and magically remembers your dog’s name. But it’s fragile, unstructured, and locked to their platform. If you switch to Gemini or Claude tomorrow, you lose your brain. You are *renting* your intelligence.\nI wanted to **OWN** my intelligence.\nSo I pivoted the project. It’s no longer just a \"memory tool.\" It is now **The Linux OS for AI Agents**.\nJust as Linux provides the file system and permissions for apps to run, Athena provides the persistent memory and governance for AI models to run.\n### What’s New in v8.5.0 (The \"OS\" Update)\n**1. The \"Hard Drive\" Architecture**\nYour AI now treats your local Markdown files as its long-term storage. It writes case studies, decision logs, and protocols to *your* disk.\n*Result:* I can switch from GPT-4o to Claude 3.5 Sonnet mid-conversation, and the new model instantly \"mounts\" my entire memory drive. No data loss.\n**2. MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)**\nI exposed the whole core as an MCP server. You can now connect any MCP-compliant tool (Cursor, Claude Desktop, personalized clients) to your memory vault.\nIt allows your IDE to say: *\"Retrieve the API specs we wrote in Session 102.\"*\n**3. Permissioning Layer (The \"Sudo\" Command)**\nJust like Linux has `rwx` permissions, Athena now has 4 capability levels. You can give an agent \"Read-Only\" access to your notes, or full \"Sudo\" access to execute code.\n**4. Three-Phase Budget (Adaptive Latency)**\nWe implemented \"Adaptive Latency.\" It spends maximum compute at boot (to load context) and shutdown (to save index), but sprints efficiently during the work session.\n### The \"F*ck SaaS\" Philosophy (Still 100% True)\nI saw the comments accusing me of selling something. Let me repeat:\n* **No Subscription.**\n* **No Signup.**\n* **No Data Logging.**\n* **MIT License.**\nThis runs locally on your machine. You pay OpenAI/Google/Anthropic directly for your API keys. I don't see a dime, and I don't see your data.\n### Why I’m doing this\nWe are heading into a world where we all have \"Agentic Extensions\" of ourselves. If you rely on OpenAI’s proprietary memory, they own your extension. If you build on a local OS, you own it.\nCode is up. Docs are updated. Go build something sovereign.\n**Repo:** [github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public](https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public)\n*(P.S. To the guy who asked if this works with Obsidian: Yes. It’s just Markdown files. Your vault is now your brain.)*\n",

I force the AI to update a markdown file (like \n\nactiveContext.md) with the *current state* and *next steps* before I close the session.\n\n\n\nThen, when I start a new chat, I just feed it that one file.

Once people start using AI for long-term or multi-project workflows, I think we all eventually run into the same problem: chat history alone isn’t a stable foundation for persistent collaboration.\n\nI’m working on a project called LoKai_2 that lives in a very similar conceptual space, but it approaches the problem from a slightly different angle. The core philosophy behind LoKai_2 is being artifact-driven first, model second, with an additional charter-based governance layer that defines how the AI is allowed to operate.\n\nThe overlap between projects like Athena and LoKai_2 is the idea that the model shouldn’t be the “brain.” The brain should live in external artifacts that persist over time.\nIn LoKai_2, nothing important is meant to live only inside a conversation. Instead:\n\n• Decisions become documents\n\n• Governance rules live in explicit files\n\n• Reusable patterns get stored as structured artifacts\n\n• Session outcomes are written back into a vault\n\n• The AI loads context from artifacts and writes results back to them\n\nSo instead of: User → Chat → hope it remembers\nIt becomes: User → Artifact Vault → Model reasons → New artifact written\n\nThe model is treated as a reasoning engine rather than a memory container, which makes the system inspectable, versionable (Git-friendly), portable across models, and much more resistant to context drift.\n\nWhere LoKai_2 differs is the governance layer. The system runs under formal charters and rule sets that define things like:\n\n• Permission boundaries\n\n• Execution safety rules\n\n• Scope control\n\n• Decision logging requirements\n\n• Behavioral expectations for the AI collaborator\n\nSo Athena feels like it’s solving the memory and retrieval layer really well, while LoKai_2 is trying to layer on a governed collaboration framework that focuses on trust, stability, and long-term behavioral consistency.\n\nHonestly, it’s encouraging to see parallel projects emerging in this space. It feels like we’re collectively discovering that once AI moves beyond casual use, it stops being “chatting” and starts becoming systems architecture.",

The \"50 flat facts\" comparison hit hard. That's exactly what the built-in Memory feels like: sticky notes that fall off.\n\n\n\nThe architecture here is smart: separating Protocols (rules), Decision Logs, and Session context makes perfect sense. One question though, how do you handle conflicts when an old Protocol contradicts a newer decision? Does it surface the conflict, or does newer always win?\n\n\n\nAnd the \"stop renting your intelligence\" framing is great. The portability angle is underrated, especially after we all watched Anthropic's Claude go down for 8 hours last month and everyone just... sat there waiting. Being able to move your entire context to another model? That's real control.\n\n\n\nGonna try this with a Salesforce project I'm documenting. If it works half as well as you describe, you've saved me hours of context-reloading hell.",

              "text": "Spot on regarding the 'sticky notes' vs 'filing cabinet'.\n\nTo answer your conflict resolution question: **Hierarchy of Truth.**\n\nAthena uses a 'Memory Bank' architecture (inspired by the Cline/Roo 'Context' pattern) which creates a strict hierarchy:\n\n1. **Active Context (Pinned):** Files like [activeContext.md](http://activeContext.md) and [`decisionLog.md`](http://decisionLog.md) are loaded into the *immediate* context window at boot. This is your RAM.\n2. **Protocols (Retrieved via RAG):** These are your Hard Drive.\n\nIf a new decision contradicts an old Protocol (e.g., 'Switch to Python' vs 'Standard: Node.js'), the **Active Context** wins because the LLM sees the explicit \"DECISION: Switch to Python\" *pinned* in its system prompt, suppressing the retrieved Protocol.\n\nBut the real magic isn't just overriding—it's **refactoring**. If a decision is permanent, Athena doesn't just 'remember' it; she prompts me to update the Protocol file itself (via `edit_file`). This prevents 'context drift' where the AI starts hallucinating new rules based on loose chat history. We treat memory like code: if the requirement changes, we commit a patch to the docs.\n\nGood luck with the Salesforce documentation — that audit trail capability is exactly what this was built for. Let me know if you hit any snags setting it up!",

BTW, all this AI business is getting us there, making it how I like it, as it will perform all the work backstage, leaving me to just make a few clicks and my software will be ready, no? Man, I talk too much), even I could tell these AI models were not being coded by straight-thinking minds. This that you have created bangpussy here, you seem to possess that mind that is exactly what is essential to create AI models that justify their second names (Artificial \"Intelligence\"). Now, I can't use what you have created here, as I have no clue how to follow your instruction (isn't there a downloadable and installable file that I just click on my laptop and it gets installed, a user interface (the user-friendly kind) with a prompt box where I just type and get to work with your AI function right away? works out-of-the-box kind of thing?) appears immediately after install? No? Forget it. People like me shouldn't even bother. (I shared on X (formerly twitter) such AI mistakes as ChatGPT calling Trump in its professional, factually accurate write-up as late as March 2025 \"former US president\" and XAi's Grok writing in its professional, factually correct write-up also in 2025 \"Vice President Biden has passed away\" and \"Adam Schiff expressed sadness over VP Biden's passing.\" (just two small crazy errors that I have encountered while using different AI models, so you can probably tell how happy I'm to learn about your work, as it in fact seems to be the product of a straight thinking mind that has been missing in the people who have been coding these AI models).",

          "text": "This is excellent work. The \"context fragmentation\" problem you're solving is probably the #1 pain point when building anything serious with LLMs. I've been working on multi-agent systems and ran into this exact issue — agents would lose critical context mid-conversation, making them unreliable for complex tasks.\n\nYour hybrid RAG approach (Vector + BM25 + reranking) is the right architecture. Pure vector search misses exact matches, and pure keyword search misses semantic similarity. The combination is chef's kiss.\n\nOne thing I'd add: for anyone building personality-driven agents (chatbots, AI characters, etc.), this kind of persistent memory is CRITICAL. Without it, your AI has amnesia every session and users notice immediately. They'll ask \"remember when we talked about X?\" and the AI draws a blank. Kills immersion instantly.\n\nI built a personality AI project (what-would-trump-do.com) to test conversational consistency, and the memory layer was the hardest part. Your solution would've saved me weeks. The markdown-based approach is brilliant because it's human-readable AND version controllable. No black box, just files you can grep.\n\nPlatform agnostic is the real superpower here. When ChatGPT goes down or changes pricing, you just take your brain elsewhere. Data sovereignty matters more than people realize.",
