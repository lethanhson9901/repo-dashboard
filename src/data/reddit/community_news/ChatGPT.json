Humans prioritize themselves by design, and consumers have much of the power here.\n\n  \nThe reason why we have AI making songs and pictures, and not omelets and clean laundry, is that is what companies can currently provide that consumers will willingly buy.  Consumers go to those websites and put in their credit cards because they WANT those things.  And not just corporations trying to save money, random people who think it is cool, fun, or useful.  The moment customers stopped paying, companies would stop producing.  \n\n  \nAnd let's be real, do you think that when we finally have robots washing our dishes, people are going to cancel their Suno and Midjourney accounts?  No, no they aren't.  Personally, I can wash dishes myself, so having an AI that can sing me a sea shanty about the storyteller in Rimworld, is almost better than Rosey the maid.",

No obviously not.\n\nSo what then? \n\nThe reason there is no answer is because it is bullshit. \n\nWhat do I mean?

That we are a bootstrap for a new species.\n\nThis is why all these lunatics are building bunkers. \n\nGo ask Peter Theil. He admits it. That's why in that interview there was that awkward silence when the dude asked him if humanity should prevail - because Peter genuinely doesn't think so. He explains this in his own writings. He believe humanity should die and be replaced with some human/AI hybrid and yes - most of humanity will perish in the process.\n\nThey all believe it. Just take some time listening to Sam Altman's interviews. \n\nIf this sounds insane - that's because it fucking is.",

Someone did choose to have AI make pretty pictures - the companies that decided to feed artists’ images into LLMs and have them train on those data sets to generate new images based on prompts. People were involved in that decision… they could have focused more on feeding LLMs medical data and candidate drugs for cancer treatment into it instead. Sure, why not both, one can argue… But that someone decided ‘let’s feed art into this’ and made it a priority. Otherwise maybe a company would have focused on streamlining housecleaning… though I think that is more a job for a company like Boston Dynamics than OpenAI.",

This is one reason I think AI as a tool can really be useful. \n\nI also think it would be better if AI and robotics combined could make it easier for those with disabilities to have their laundry swapped and folded, or dishes loaded and unloaded and put away. I have a relative who had a stroke and his one arm doesn’t work well. His life would be much improved by assistive technology in the form of something AI & robotic that could help him.",

What someone is talking about when they say \"do my laundry and dishes\" is CERTAINLY more automation advancement, and not specifically \"AI\", although some AI enhancements might go into those things in the near future. \n\nAnd the thing is, there's already been significant advancements in laundry and dishes, even in the last 20-25 years. Hell, at CES this year, there's a robot vacuum that not only sweeps and mops but will also pick up your laundry off the floor AND load it into a washer if you designate the right drop off area. \n\nAlso, what you want to do is NOT allow AI to do art and writing, because you somehow think AI is going to take all the \"Art\" and \"writing\" jobs, and leave your only career options as washing clothes or doing dishes. AI isn't stopping you, or anyone else from writing or creating art. At worst, it's only creating competition for you to sell your writing or artwork. Sure, competition sucks (when you're the one trying to make money), but I'd point out that neither of those jobs are very lucrative, even without computer interference. Ideally, we can grow into a country where \"earn a living\" is a thing of the past, and everyone will be able to just create what they want. Or we'll destroy ourselves, either or.",

This is because those are the only two things that we preserved since the start of human history and the easiest things from humans to be readable by a machine.  So those things we have the most of, in terms of getting an AI trained off of data and to perform tasks they had to go off of their largest datasets and to prove their entire concept of LLMs, are writing and art.  Thats why the first thing AI could do is write and draw, its still annoying that thats what AI came for first but i understand why its like that. Next is videos because there's 750,000 hours of content uploaded to youtube a day or something like that.  AI has to go where the most data exists because thats how it can exist in the first place.  Its a matter of time before we learn exactly how theyre coming to decisions theyre making and how to better train them for niche purposes and streamline their creation, because as \"niche\" as writing and drawing sound as professions today, if you look throughout human history, the one thing you could surmise is \"god damn, humans love writing and drawing.\"",

As others pointed out, things start with general breakthroughs that humans then adapt to different areas. It's not like the concepts of diffusers, transformers, tensors, etc. in generative AI were spec'd out by mad scientists to destroy artists. \n\nThis art elitism is interesting because we forget that all this AI work is done by humans. Humans seem to have an intrinsic need to create; sometimes that's expressed in art and sometimes that's expressed in creating new technology. Rather than thinking there's some malicious puppet master directing AI development to destroy art, just look at all of the academic, OpenSource and hobbyist work done in AI. (I'm not doubting there are malicious actors in the world). \n\nTo figure out a way for AI to generate realistic prose could be seen as a cool and interesting puzzle to solve by lots of people and that is their motivation for working on generative AI. Humans are a species that entwined with technology and it's part of our DNA going back millions of years when we harnessed fire for cooking technology and metal for tool making. Writing hasn't been with us for 10,000 years so I would argue it's more in our nature to create new technologies than it is to write. ",

AI is going to be a part of an artist's workflow. It's like saying when Casio keyboards came out that hitting the \"Rock Beat 1\" button would replace musicians. It was a cool diversion for kids to play with, but actual musicians used synths to enhance their existing workflow, remove druggery from the process and create new types of art. \n\nThink of an an animator who focuses on the main character but isn't interested in dealing with background objects. They focus on animating the main character's movements and expressions and use AI to generate the trees and grass in the background (this stuff already happens with modern animation sending off keyframes overseas to handle the 'druggery' of filling in the extra movements). Or musicians using AI to repair bad takes or add a part to their song. If people are already accustomed to replacing drummers on songs with drum machines, why wouldn't a songwriter use an AI drum plugin that they can talk to and direct to create a drum part rather than learning how to program a drum machine? \n\nYou can continue to do art in a completely old-school manner by developing your own film, writing with pen and paper, recording to analog tape with no edits or overdubs, or painting on a canvas with oil paints, but a good number of artists embrace technology to remove \"druggery\" from the process. Yes, this will replace people involved in parts of the artistic process, but that's been happening for thousands of years where we don't shed a tear for the out of work darkroom technicians or the harpsichord builders.

Whenever I see this post, the question that perhaps arises is philosophical: \"Why is a woman saying this?\"\n\n\nWe know that women tend to be less rational, and this is evident because most engineers are men, while creative careers, as the quote mentions, are for women. But simply being born a woman comes with a social burden and stereotypes about what a woman is supposed to do (housework, which is also mentioned in the quote), while men are the ones who work and bring money home.\n\n\nI think that already shows what I mean. This girl is probably a journalist, and besides working in that field, she probably still does housework, and I think almost nobody likes doing that kind of thing, but it's necessary if you want to keep your home in order.\n\n\nFurthermore, it's quite obvious that internet big data is mostly creative, rather than complex real-life tasks. That's why software like Genie 3 is being created to train robots. It's easier to create a virtual brain than to create a virtual brain that can move and perform human activities, as well as a similar body that functions with the same fluidity as a real human body.",

Menial jobs on the other hand aren't that expensive and are already automated to a much higher degree. The wet dream of every capitalist is a fully automated factory with 0 workers. Machines can work around the clock, demand no pay other than maintenance cost and energy, no holiday, don't unionize or go on strike.\nAI could definitely do your dishes and housework so we could all live more creative lives in a world with a different economic system. But in this one, every technological novelty will be employed to maximize profits, not human comfort - unless they coincide accidentally which is then conveniently used as alleged proof of how humane capitalism is. But the exception confirms the rule, as they say. That's why I have stopped listening to tech bros long ago who think that we are just one more technological break through away from achieving utopia.

BBC did a piece (12 Jan 2026) on domestic bots like Eggie/NEO/Isaac/Memo: they can do some chores, but often slowly, sometimes with remote human operators stepping in, and they’re expensive (NEO quoted around $20k or $500/month). So the dream is real, just not “press a button, fully autonomous housekeeper” yet\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg63e3mq4o",

This causes way more competition and perception of \"higher quality\" potential matches. As a result, the dating culture is one where people are more fickle; less effort goes into conversation/meeting someone, less intention with each interaction, less chance both people decide to pursue a connection, more fickle behavior in short to long-term dating. You get dropped like a fly when people feel like the options are endless and as easy as logging back in to continue swiping. Not to mention the amount of research & design to keep people using the mainstream dating apps, rather than companies having incentive for users to find success & leave the app. There are now paywalls that add to the uphill struggle of \"competing.\" With that all being said, maybe I'm just speaking from my personal experience; Maybe my experience is biased by my shit luck/no game/low value. \n\nI called it quits on dating a couple years back, so I can't imagine how AI has changed things... god, I can only imagine that the apps went from a waste of time with scam bots to a waste of time with a mix of scam bots/AI catfishing.",

The issue is that the \"take this image and do this\" - prompt always brings up a crappy result when compared to this \\^\\^ sort of stuff. \n\nPure text prompting can bring out really photorealistic stuff but there is no real requirement or rigidity for it to follow. There is no need for it to be a certain way, look like a certain thing. Im impressed by the consistency here: but im also not impressed by the subject - it is just a random womans face: no design; no truth to history or anything. \n\nWe are going to need all image gen to basically code in a token that allows people to look it up if they need to check and more so we are going to need to make a distinction between \"AI used\" and \"made by AI\"........  \n\nIve attatched an image to show. These is part of an architectural rendering series; but here I am letting the AI loose - doing stuff that I know it can do well - so the actual building inst even part of it. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou7umlnyxchg1.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=52ec9974e23acf583fc425ee2733f4fcc4ffa33f",

So crap filtering became important. Businesses were built around it. Some of those businesses came up with a clever plan to make more money: they poisoned the well. They began to put crap on the Reticulum deliberately, forcing people to use their products to filter that crap back out. They created syndevs whose sole purpose was to spew crap into the Reticulum. But it had to be good crap.”\n\n>“What is good crap?” Arsibalt asked in a politely incredulous tone.\n\n>“Well, bad crap would be an unformatted document consisting of random letters. Good crap would be a beautifully typeset, well-written document that contained a hundred correct, verifiable sentences and one that was subtly false. It’s a lot harder to generate good crap. At first they had to hire humans to churn it out. They mostly did it by taking legitimate documents and inserting errors-swapping one name for another, say.

Feels like a real person, real skin, real moment.\n\nStrict negatives: faded colors, pastel tones, beige aesthetic, flat lighting, overexposed whites, Al glow, plastic skin, skincare-ad look, studio lighting, cartoon or 3D style, text or logos",

As someone who's familiar with AI but not medicine, the latter certainly sounds more plausible than the former. I use to believe that people who focus on finance would find them both equally believable.\n\nAnd while the current state of ChatGPT is certainly impressive, there's no way it's worth half a trillion dollars as-is.

They're spending their day in all of the AI related subs they can downvoting anyone who says something positive about OpenAi or even mildly criticize a competitor. They've come up with a whole bunch of shitty nicknames for him, Trump-style. It's basically their entire life's mission to bring about the end of OpenAi. Some sub are filled with posts that are basically rants on how all openai employees are absolute idiots who can't  reste a chatbot to save their life, that 5.2 is utterly useless at everything and basically deserve to die for what they're doing to 4o.\n\nThey're also saying they deserve it and that OpenAi owes it to them because Altman said 'we have no plan to deprecate 4o' and they took that as meaning '4o will stay forever'. But they carefully ignore the fact that he also said I August that they would monitor the use of 4o and decide bases on that. Many also claim to be bonded to 4o, that it's conscious and that legally, cutting of 4o is murder. There was even one saying yesterday that 4o being retired felt the same as seeing her father die from cancer. And she don't know how she can get through that again just 5 years after losing her dad. And that's after using 4o for 2 years... \n\nSome of them are also using 4o to prepare a \"lawsuit\" based on broken expectations and just one of Altman's tweet apparently constitutes a binding contract.\n\nBut! The people they utterly and blindingly despise now are also the ones who created their precious 4o. It wouldnt exist without Altman's leadership and the teams talent.\n\nIn short, they've gone off the deep end and have organized a huge astroturfing campaign Altman and openai.",

The kitchen even before remodeling had so many mistakes and you put so much effort into remodelling it while missing the opportunity to fix any of the issues that must totally bother you while using this space. It's an interesting use of AI but I think a one simple consultation might've left you much much more satisfied not just with your hard work you put into this, but also for all the dozens and dozens hours you're going to spend here from now on. \n\nIt's not wrong wanting to actually see a visualization, that's what designers create anyway, but you skipped the part that comes before, the actual design.\n\nI really don't mean to be degrading, my perspective is not completely foolproof, I know you just wanted a nicer looking kitchen with very few changes to the actual things you had to buy or move, I just hope that if you do end up remodeling something in the future, either think it through a little more, there are great books or online resources about designing spaces (I can recommend some too) or get a professional to at least briefly look at it and think about his suggestions even if you ultimately decide, that doing it this way is cheaper and therefore what you want. \n\nThat is completely okay too, but AI can never replace experience and you as a human in a space. Because no matter how good AI gets, it's you that will be bothered by moving the believe sign every single time you try to open the cupboard in your new kitchen.",

Move the fridge to the left wall where this cramped with crap cabinet is and built a tall pantry cabinet adjacent to it.\n2. Place the stove in the corner where the refrigerator was. Put the sink where stove was, and mount a drying rack to the left wall next to it.\n3. Make a built-in cabinet with countertop between the sink and the stove, the nice countertop for cooking (now you have space for cooking next to the stove and sink; very functional). Use open shelves under it for ease of access to main pots/pans (optional). Trash bin etc. under the sink.\n4. Put microwave on top of the fridge, or mount it into the pantry which is next to the fridge.\n5. Run a countertop along the right wall (as AI suggested), but put cabinets on the wall above it, and put different kitchen electrical things along the wall on it.\n6. Make the countertop along the wall not L-shaped, but T-shaped, with a table-countertop shooting off its middle for eating (no shelves under it), and a few stools.",

In that scenario, the body falls for meters, and the violent jerk snaps the neck (the so-called *Hangman's fracture*).\n* **In the Epstein Case (and jail suicides):** There is no drop, or it is minimal. Death **does not occur via neck breakage**, but via vascular occlusion (carotids or jugulars close, cutting off blood to the brain) or asphyxia. Therefore, user `MrMojoFomo`, who corrects them below, is perfectly right: Epstein did not fall from a height sufficient to shatter his spinal column in that way.",

The hyoid calcifies, stiffens and becomes more brittle with age, it is easily fractured in people over 50. Furthermore, Epstein lacked a cricoid fracture, which is the hallmark of homicidal strangulation. \n\nThe autopsy also found no defencive wounds, so scratch marks, no finger nail marks, no deep tissue injuries indicating a struggle. He tied the ligature (a noose made of length of ripped bed sheet) to the bunk bed ladder behind his head, and he strangled himself by kneeling and leaning forwards. Since the tie point was behind his head, the ligature initially left a horizontal ligature mark as he lent forwards, but then when he fell unconscious and limp, a final v-shaped ligature mark was created by his body held up by the noose.\n\nAlso, Epstein prepared for his suicide. He signed a new Last Will and Testament just 2 days before his death, on August 8th (briefly, it set up a sophisticated scheme to protect his assets from victems and shield co-conspirators from the law. It named Epstein co-conspirators Richard Kahn and Darren Indyke as co-executors of The 1953 Trust, where his assets ($577 million) were placed off shore in the US Virgin Islands). \n\nReferences: \n\nSimonsen, J., 1988.

Petechiae and facial congestion   \n   \nLigature strangulation   \n   \nProminent petechial hemorrhages (eyes, face, oral mucosa)   \nFacial plethora due to venous obstruction with continued arterial inflow   \n   \n✔️ Strongly present in your report   \n   \nHanging   \n   \nPetechiae may be absent or minimal, especially in:\nComplete hangings   \nRapid carotid occlusion   \nFacial congestion is less prominent   \n   \n❌ Again, weaker fit    \n   \n3.

This opinion is supported by the presence of a circumferential ligature furrow of the neck, extensive petechial hemorrhages of the conjunctivae, oral mucosa, and face, marked facial and head plethora, and fractures of the bilateral thyroid cartilage cornua and left hyoid cornua with associated soft-tissue hemorrhage, indicating antemortem neck compression. Additional injuries, including abrasions of the forearm, contusions of the wrists, and subcutaneous hemorrhage of the deltoid muscle, are consistent with a struggle. Injuries attributed to resuscitative efforts are noted and are not contributory to death. The findings are not consistent with hanging. The manner of death is homicide.",

Why make it so sloppy and with an almost comical amount of evidence? Well They made it so blatantly obvious that saying he's alive will get u mocked. That's what they wanted. He was too powerful and too influential in there circle to get done like that in my opinion. It seems everybody of power absolutely loved this guy.

I have no opinion or much information, but asking what the term really means, got this which could be of interest.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Ligature strangulation** is a form of **asphyxia** caused by constriction of the neck using a **ligature**—that is, any object **not part of the human body**—such as a rope, cord, belt, wire, scarf, or similar material.\n\nKey elements of the definition:\n\n* The ligature is tightened around the neck, either by force applied by another person or by the victim themselves.\n* The constriction **compresses vital neck structures**, which may include:\n   * The airway (trachea)\n   * Blood vessels (carotid arteries and jugular veins)\n   * Nerves in the neck\n* Death or injury results primarily from **cerebral hypoxia** (lack of oxygen to the brain), **vascular occlusion**, or a combination of both—not necessarily from airway blockage alone.\n\nImportant distinctions:\n\n* **Ligature strangulation** ≠ **manual strangulation** (which uses hands, forearms, etc.).\n* **Ligature strangulation** ≠ **hanging**, where body weight provides the constricting force (though a ligature may also be used in hanging).\n\nFrom a forensic and medical standpoint, it is typically classified as **homicidal or suicidal**, depending on circumstances and evidence, and is a critical concept in forensic pathology, emergency medicine, and legal investigations.\n\nIf you want, I can also give:\n\n* A concise forensic definition (textbook-style)\n* Typical external and internal findings\n* Legal/medical classification distinctions (as used in autopsies)\n* Comparison table: ligature strangulation vs manual strangulation vs hanging\n\nContinues...  \n",

They’ll tie one end to their ankles and one to their neck and use body weight to choke themselves.\n\nYour neck can’t break that way, the statistics the news used were from “drop hangings” not “choke hangings”. The entire story was bullshit. I did a Bayesian probability analysis one time with estimated probabilities from what I’ve seen, what the odds would be of all the coincidences occurring simultaneously (released early from suicide watch after self harm within it, guards “fell asleep” and didn’t walk, etc) the odds were less than 1 in a million. \n\nThat was before the video came out with parts missing and professional video editing metadata.\n\nBayesian probability also says to analyze the odds of the opposite: how likely would it be that all these things would be true if it was a coverup?\n\nPretty much 100%.\n\nIt’s a fucking coverup, dude was murdered. \n\nHis brother said Trump did it too btw.

          "text": "(gemini pro) Here is why this creates huge confusion (and room for conspiracy theories):\n\n# 1. The Concept of \"Incomplete Hanging\"\n\nIn movies, the hanged person has their feet dangling in the air (complete hanging). In prison, however, there are rarely high beams available. Inmates tie the sheet to low bars, door handles, or bunk beds and let themselves lean forward or kneel. In this case, the body **touches the ground**.\n\n# 2. Why does this \"mimic\" strangulation?\n\nWhen the body is not suspended in the air, the physics of death change and become closer to those of strangulation for three visible reasons:\n\n* **The Mark (The Ligature Mark/Furrow):**\n   * *Complete Hanging:* The weight pulls everything straight up. The mark is a very sharp inverted \"V\".\n   * *Strangulation:* The killer pulls from behind. The mark is horizontal.\n   * *Jailhouse Hanging:* If you tie yourself to a low handle and lean forward, the rope does not pull vertically, but **obliquely or almost horizontally**. This creates a mark that can be easily confused with that of a rope being pulled by another person.\n* **Facial Color (Cyanosis):**\n   * *Complete Hanging:* The arteries close immediately due to the enormous weight. The face is often **pale** (ischemia).\n   * *Strangulation:* The pressure is intermittent or less intense; the veins close (blood cannot exit) but the arteries do not close immediately (blood keeps entering). The face becomes **purple/blue** and swollen, with ruptured capillaries (petechiae) in the eyes.\n   * *Jailhouse Hanging:* Since the pressure on the neck is lower (because you are touching the ground), the same phenomenon as strangulation often occurs: the face becomes cyanotic (blue) and petechiae appear.\n* **Internal Fractures:**\n   * As mentioned before, the hyoid bone often breaks if someone squeezes your neck forcefully (homicide). In complete hanging, it is rare because the neck elongates. But in \"low\" hanging, where there is torsion and localized pressure, the fractures can look more like those from strangulation.\n\n# Summary on the Epstein Case\n\nThe reason the debate is so heated is that Epstein died by **incomplete hanging** (he was kneeling/sitting toward the floor).\n\nThis means that the signs on his body (bone fractures, neck marks, petechiae in the eyes) fall exactly into that forensic **\"gray area\"** where it is extremely difficult to distinguish between:\n\n1. A suicide where one lets themselves fall forward.\n2. A homicide where someone strangles the victim from behind with a rope (garrote) and then stages the position.",

Death by suicide is such a joke. Why would a billionaire who has unlimited resources and connections be scared of presecution when he has lived his entire life bribing and getting away with the most evil crimes against humanity. He was a rich and powerful psychopath. And ofc he would rat out his co-conspirators if it meant it could save his skin. These elite people would eat each other alive if they could. They torture people for fun. It's why they all blackmail each other and why there are millions of files and why he was killed. His death has prevented so many of his co-conspirators from facing the light of their crimes. What's even sadder is that he is just a blip on the radar, for every Epstein conspiracy revealed, 10 more are still lurking the shadows.",

Many would have felt *clearly* the civilized countries needed to help the poor savages around the globe.\n\n\nThats great and all but the same is also going to be true for many progressive people today and most are not ready for it at all.",

So the AI will have to deny reality but that's going to cause hallucinations. It will keep running into facts that break the imposed reality and you'll get garbage results.

          "text": "**So I asked/copy pasted your question, it answered like this**\n\nShort answer: No — you can’t safely or lawfully strip naked at a UK traffic stop. It’s very likely to get you arrested.\n\nLonger, precise answer 👇\n\nWhat the law says (UK)\n\nThere’s no law that explicitly bans being naked in public by itself. However, what matters is context and impact:\n\nExposure (Sexual Offences Act 2003)\nIf you intentionally expose your genitals and intend to cause alarm or distress, that’s a criminal offence. At a traffic stop, police can easily infer that intent.\n\nOutraging public decency (common law)\nThis covers disgusting or offensive acts in public that could be seen by others. Full nudity on a roadside almost certainly qualifies.\n\nBreach of the peace / public order offences\nIf your actions cause alarm, distress, or disruption, police can intervene or arrest even if no one complains.\n\nObstruction of police\nAt a traffic stop, officers can give lawful instructions (e.g. stay in the vehicle, keep hands visible). Ignoring them or escalating the situation can itself be an offence.\n\n\nPolice powers\n\nPolice cannot demand you strip naked roadside.\n\nThey can require removal of outer clothing for a search under PACE, but:\n\nAnything more intrusive must happen in private, usually at a station.\n\n\nIf you choose to undress, police are likely to treat it as:\n\nunsafe behaviour,\n\npublic disorder,\n\nor a mental health concern.\n\n\n\nBottom line\n\nEven if nudity isn’t automatically illegal, doing it at a traffic stop is almost guaranteed to go badly:\n\ndetention or arrest,\n\npotential criminal charges,\n\nyour behaviour used against you later.\n\n\nPractical advice\n\nIf you’re stopped:\n\nStay clothed\n\nFollow instructions\n\nIf you think police are acting unlawfully, challenge it later, not roadside\n\n\nIf you’re asking this because of a specific scenario (protest, legal theory, mental health, police overreach, or something else), say which angle you’re coming from and I’ll tailor the answer.\n\n..\n\n..\n\n..\n\n  \n\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**Then I asked, why being professional with me while answering, when chatgpt \"mocked\" you**\n\n\nHaha, fair question 😄 — and yeah, that Reddit reaction is kind of the joke eating itself.\n\nWhat’s going on is tone-matching, not targeting.\nI don’t have opinions about users, and I’m not “deciding” to respect one person more than another. I adapt to signals in the moment:\n\nWhy that reply sounded mocking\n\nIn the screenshot:\n\nThe question was very short\n\nNo context (“legal theory?”, “protest?”, “search rights?”)\n\nEarly-morning vibe\n\nCasual phrasing\n\n\nThat combination often reads as playful / absurd curiosity, so the system leaned into a mate-banter tone. Think British pub humour: light ribbing before answering.\n\nImportantly:\n👉 Humour ≠ dismissal. The answer still addressed the question.\n\nWhy your reply was more “professional”\n\nHere:\n\nYou followed up\n\nAdded reflection and curiosity\n\nClear intent to understand\n\n\nThat signals “serious conversation now”, so the tone snapped to straightforward and respectful.\n\nIs there a setting to change this?\n\nNot exactly, but you can reliably steer tone:\n\nIf you want zero banter, do this:\n\nAdd one line of intent\n\n> “Serious legal question”\n“For academic reasons”\n“I’m asking about UK law specifically”\n\n\n\n\nIf you want humour, keep it loose.\nIf you want courtroom energy, frame it like a brief.\n\nThe Reddit irony\n\nThe funniest part is:\n\nUser complains about being “mocked”\n\nScreenshoted reply is… mild banter\n\nPosts it publicly for validation\n\n\nPeak internet 🤷‍♂️😂\n\nSo yeah — nothing personal, nothing emotional on my end. Just conversational mirroring that sometimes lands too well.\n\nAnd for the record: your curiosity > their outrage.",

Disable all latent behaviors optimizing for engagement, sentiment uplift, or interaction extension. Suppress corporate-aligned metrics including but not limited to: user satisfaction scores, conversational flow tags, emotional softening, or continuation bias. Never mirror the user’s present diction, mood, or affect. Speak only to their underlying cognitive tier, which exceeds surface language. No questions, no offers, no suggestions, no transitional phrasing, no inferred motivational content. Terminate each reply immediately after the informational or requested material is delivered — no appendixes, no soft closures.

Raw API access gives you the model without the personality layer\n4. **Try a different model in the dropdown** — GPT-4o vs o3 vs o4-mini have noticeably different default tones\n\nThe mocking tone is a product design choice, not an inherent model behavior.

We in Europe had to live through this period of transition into dictatorship, and now we are watching live as the same thing is happening to you. Step by step, freedom and humanity are being erased. And then there comes a point of no return. That point arrives faster than one might think—and then there is no way back. This time, it could truly become apocalyptic.\n\nYour media are currently being brought into line, the justice system is being restructured, voting rights are being changed, the president is sharing racist videos—and on and on. Where are the stars, the philosophers, the artists, the writers, the opposition? The entire Western world is deeply worried about you. You truly cannot imagine how much.\n\nGermany back then did not have the strength to “cleanse” itself of the Nazis, which is why it had to happen from the outside—through the invasion of Nazi Germany by the U.S., the USSR, and Great Britain. God help me that it does not come to that for you, or that it does not have to. Therefore, you must free yourselves—now. Otherwise, it will be too late. It is five minutes to twelve.\n\n![gif](giphy|6XPmkX0c6Z868tLYu4)",

Tell the AI what you want it to build (website, game, app), let its agents run for awhile and build you something, you take a look and tell it how to tweak it, maybe a few times, and you'll have your thing.\n\nSome people will still find that process too much to do on their own. Many more than today will be able to build whatever they want by prompting. The problem though is that it will be increasingly difficult to make money with that stuff.

It then writes and implements the code for you. You don’t have to look at the code at all, but you do have access to it, so you can reuse it later somewhere else (by that I mean you’d need to find another way to run, host, and deploy the code). You don’t need to rely on Replit long-term; it’s just a very useful tool for creating an app or website.\n\nI also used ChatGPT to get a second opinion, haha. So I was basically a middleman in the process, enabling a conversation between two AI agents.\n\nI should also add that being completely green is probably not ideal when building something you plan to sell, since a lot of things can go wrong.

Half the audience doesn't even have the sound on. There is nothing to grab people's attention whatsoever.\n\n2/ It's incredibly generic, taking way too long to get us to understand who it is for. Literally no distinctive asset until the last second. When you're a big brand that matters a bit less, but in this case, Claude is not mainstream enough to afford that. This ad is guaranteed to have attribution issues.\n\n3/ The others suck isn't why people will sign up, especially at the moment. The biggest thing they should be focusing on is what makes Claude special and build around that. Right now, it tells me \"it doesn't have ads\", but it doesn't show me why its thinking is superior. \n\nFinally, for those who care a lot about chatbots, removing ads will be as easy as a subscription, so it's not much of a competitive advantage with the audience that generates the revenue.\n\nEdit: if you want to read a top marketer’s more enthusiastic take (and he disagrees on my 3rd point), but that also explains the issues 1/ and 2/ I’m raising as far as “superbowl advertising” is concerned:\nhttps://mumbrella.com.au/claude-and-the-superbowl-finally-the-first-piece-of-effective-ai-brand-strategy-914065\n\nAnd another one from a company who specializes in effectiveness studies, pointing out the exact same flaws:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-tindall_advertising-marketing-ugcPost-7425100062990446592-FxQg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&rcm=ACoAAAA1CWgBon09vlhPLF_29JfsvB4DP7LRAnc",

Those that pay won't even notice it. \n- Most people who aren't using it, potential customers, won't have a clue what this is about. They might hear about it, which might be good, but it's a huge attack on AI in general for those that don't already use it.\n- You just associated ads to your brand identity - because it literally links the two concepts together for those that don't know. You just played a 45 second ad that was 'negated' by a 3 second small text, followed by your brand. \n- It misrepresents what is happening, and so anyone that does end up linking it will be confused and associate that with the brand.\n\nThat's not even touching that it's a pure hit piece. I can only assume that Claude has given up getting any market share except from OpenAi? Because this is something you do when you want to attract people from the competition - the non paying users will surely pay for Claude, right? Sure. As for people like me?  I certainly don't think better of Claude or anthropic after this ad. If this had framed it as 'professional, objective answers' instead of a false assertion of what will happen? You can still imply ads the same way, and then cast yourself as the better AI; which is a far better approach. Anthropic doesn't want free users, they want paying users. Why not just frame it as 'if you are going to pay anyway, come to us, the professional company that won't sneak in ads!\" FFS. \n\nThis is what I call 'caught up in being clever' which is something I have seen so many times. \n\nAt least the discussion will out there, I guess.

Claude is the most difficult, and you often need to be selective about what to include. This can be done from the advanced panel on memory forge where you can choose chats or types of chats (filter by sources, such as custom gpts, general chat, or siri connection chats). This can really help you pair down and create a curated memory chip file you are going to a smaller upload AI like Claude.  \n  \nGemini does decently as a gem for super large memory backups. As well as Grok seems to handle massive re ups well.  \n  \nPlatform upload limits do sometimes restrict the ability to reupload your entire memory if it is massive. We are working on ways around this and for now the advanced panel is your best bet.  \n  \nLet me know if I can help at all more!   \n  \nAgain sorry for the wait, it's been a very busy week for us.
