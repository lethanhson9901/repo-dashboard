CBZ files are just ZIP files, and ZIP files are random-access at the file level (though not within files). They contain an index that allows seeking to arbitrary files. I know you know this because you correctly said in your README that both CBZ and your BBF format include an index as a footer. So why are you saying the opposite here? \n\nYou say you observed CPU usage spikes when scrubbing through pages, but why are you attributing that to the file format itself, and not the reader program you're using?\n\nAnyway, I think there's something badly wrong with your benchmark. There's no indication in your repo of how you actually measured performance, but you seem to be overestimating the latency of reading CBZ files by at least 20x.\n\nMy very simple benchmark code:\n\n    import zipfile, random\n    zf = zipfile.ZipFile(\"test.cbz\")\n    filenames = [info.filename for info in zf.infolist() if not info.is_dir()]\n    \n    def random_read():\n        filename = random.choice(filenames)\n        with zf.open(filename) as f:\n            f.read()\n\nThis is what I get when I run it on a real-world archive (about 46MB):\n\n    $ python3 -mtimeit -s \"import cbz_bench\" \"cbz_bench.random_read()\"\n    5000 loops, best of 5: 84.3 usec per loop\n\nWhich is 22x faster than the fastest of your CBZ benchmark results.\n\nI am extremely doubtful that your format is *actually* meaningfully faster than CBZ.",

Like, come on, Kotatsu, the \"Days\" in \"Sakamoto Days\" does not refer to the time budget you have to open the weekly releases.\n\nIt makes no sense to me: indexing into a JPG should be fast. Loading a JPG should be fast. I wonder if modern CBZ readers just lazily include a pre-made zip library to completely decompress the entire archive before loading the images. Or if people creating the CBZ files do not understand ZIP files and turn on maximum compression, expecting to squeeze more bits out JPGs, adding pointless decompression overhead without any real gains.",

To justify that, you would want to see actual concrete benefits that are specific to the metadata format. And in particular you'd want to see advantages that outweigh the disadvantages of losing XML's extensibility.\n\nThe criticism expressed in the README is that even though CBZ has an XML metadata format, it's not standardized across different reader software. So writing it up as a documented standard (or designing an alternative) that all the reader implementations could agree on, without losing any functionality, *would* be a valuable contribution.

It's meaningless to talk about \"seeking\" in a memory-mapped archive because there's no file pointer to seek.\n\nTo do a meaningful benchmark, you need to actually do something with the data. For a comic archive format, a natural choice is to *decode* a randomly-chosen image file to read its pixel data. And this is a more useful measurement, because it tells you how much speedup you can expect from an actual reader implementation.\n\nSo I wrote another simple benchmark that does exactly that, using Python's Pillow library to decode PNGs:\n\n    $ python3 -mtimeit -s \"import cbz_bench_decode\" \"cbz_bench_decode.random_read()\"\n    100 loops, best of 5: 2.51 msec per loop\n    $ python3 -mtimeit -s \"import bbf_bench_decode\" \"bbf_bench_decode.random_read()\"\n    100 loops, best of 5: 2.41 msec per loop\n\nSo there is a small difference in performance, but in a realistic environment it's only about 4% faster, not 100x as you claimed in your title.\n\nThe *absolute* speedup is only about ~100usec, which is much smaller than the differences between CBZ and BBF that your benchmark claimed to show. And such a small time interval is absolutely imperceptible to humans. So whatever was causing the \"CPU spikes\" that you saw, it almost certainly wasn't due to the file format.\n\nI don't think you're lying. I didn't say that and I didn't mean to imply it. I do think that your benchmark methodology is probably flawed.",

I’m also not sure that it even outputs the page order at all? Or are images silently renamed internally based on order? \n\nEven if I wanted to brute force edit the file by extracting and muxing again (which pretty much destroys any benefit of incorporating it into the file structure), I couldn’t easily do so. Can’t even parse the output into correct files to provide as cli input, because metadata doesn’t take a file as input for some reason.\n\nYou say one of your advantages is native metadata structure in the file format, but even if we accept that is an actual advantage, you don’t have the tools to handle metadata here.  (Also, if you’re making that comparison table, epub also does not have file native metadata, it’s a sidecar file. Also cbr and folders can both incorporate sidecar metadata files.)",

          "text": "I don't agree with some people (mostly on HN) that this is AI slop, but I can understand their POV, since OP seems to have several misunderstandings on some things, and admitted to use of AI on the benchmarking. (FWIW, after reading it, I do not think the code itself was created by AI.)\n\nOccam's razor dictates that this was not malicious in nature, but OP is a young student (based off their comments here, their language/tone in the code, and their use of discord), who was enthusiastic about their side-project, eager to show it off to the world, and perhaps jumped the gun and oversold it well, quite a bit. \n\nOthers already talked about the format itself, questioned the claims and benchmarks, and whether it really is warranted as a replacement for cbz/cbr, so I won't talk too much about that aspect  (Personally, I think by virtue of OP's file format being a binary file format that is a container for images that does not need to do any decompression or XML parsing, it will be a bit faster. But I think this difference to be negligible, and the slow speed OP experienced was because of the application used, not the cbz/cbr file format itself. IMO, perhaps a format that mandates specific good compression with a balance of speed/compression ratio, and perhaps mandates thumbnails or progressive jpegs or similar for images for faster scrubbing before loading the full image. But I digress). Instead, I'll have a brief look at the (C++) code.\n\nDisclaimer: I did not fully verify/run the code on my machine in my review. Though it looks safe based off a quick glance, I do not have the time, and do not want to risk myself unnecessarily anyway.\n\nThe biggest issue I see is a potential buffer overrun.\n\nIn getString for example\n\n        const char *poolStart = (const char *)mmap.data + footer.stringPoolOffset;\n        size_t poolSize = footer.assetTableOffset - footer.stringPoolOffset;\n        if (offset >= poolSize)\n            return \"OFFSET_ERR\";\n        return std::string_view(poolStart + offset);\n\nEverything in footer is earlier controlled by the file via `std::memcpy(&footer, (uint8_t *)mmap.data + mmap.size - sizeof(BBFFooter), sizeof(BBFFooter));` with no checks. So `footer.stringPoolOffset` is attacker-controlled (so is `footer.assetTableOffset`, so you can bypass the `OFFSET_ERR` check). This means you can read out of bounds memory. \n\nIf someone were to wrap this library in a REST API or something similar and expose it to the web, and an endpoint was designated for returning the title of a BBF book, it would be a vulnerability that gives an attacker some form of a memory read primitive.  \n\nThe same could be said for when outputting the images as well.\n\n                const auto &asset = assets[pages[i].assetIndex];\n\n                // FIX: Use the library function to get the extension\n                // This automatically handles PNG, JPG, AVIF, JXL, etc.\n                std::string ext = MediaTypeToStr(asset.type);\n\n                std::string outPath = (fs::path(outDir) / (\"p\" + std::to_string(i + 1) + ext)).string();\n\n                std::ofstream ofs(outPath, std::ios::binary);\n                ofs.write((const char *)reader.mmap.data + asset.offset, asset.length);\n\n`asset.offset` and `asset.length` are attacker-controlled inputs from the file. So this is even an arguably even worse vulnerability, since it would make sense that if this were to be self-hosted, there would be an endpoint for extracting images from a BBF file and returning it to the user, and it wouldn't be confined to what a `std::string_view` could hold.\n\nNot really a vulnerability, but there is also an issue where if a `--section=` ends with a \":\", it would probably throw an exception that is not caught, since a substr() would be called with a position that is equal to the length of string.\n\nThere are plenty of other more minor things (and perhaps maybe-not-so-minor things I missed), but can be chalked up to inexperience. Such as the occasional magic variable (`int targetVerifyIndex = -2;` ), or cli arguments being collected in an std::vector and using `find(<option>)` which is O(N) every time instead of just iterating over each argument and matching it against the option (Not really an issue since you are likely to not use many arguments, but still. I personally would have used a third party library, though I understand not relying too much on external dependencies), not initializing default values for the structs, organisation could be better with separate header/cpp files and folder hierarchy for third-party code, a `.clang-format/.clang-tidy` formatter/linter, lack of unit tests, not always using `auto` when it is possible, despite using it sometimes elsewhere, C-Style casts being used, rule of 5 being violated for BBFBuilder which is probably silently causing some problems, for-range loops not always being used when possible despite being used sometimes,  and I'm sure more things I did not think of. EDIT: Another thing is having a separate CMake target for the library and the cli tool, so one could actually use it as a library.\n\nStill, I applaud OP for the effort and enthusiasm, to find a problem they're facing and try to design their own file format. Nonetheless, I would be wary of using this library myself and do not advise others to do so, but at the very least I am sure it was a good learning exercise/project for OP.",

I did the tests using high-resolution scans of One Piece. The benchmarks are as close as you can get to real-world numbers.\n\n\\> But what are the measurable impacts on users experience that justify its existence.  \n1. It's faster on external hard drives by a longshot. If you want to load all of one piece and go to 320, BBF has O(1) random access and scrubbing (except for my HDD trial, which is because of the threading), and it can map directly onto your SSD with mmap.  \n2. Because of this, it consumes significantly less CPU. So if you're on a mobile device, reading in BBF format is better for your battery life.  \n3. Images are also deduplicated, which is great for manhwa. When testing, I downloaded Solo Leveling from mangadex and put it in BBF format. There was nearly 200 deduplicated pages. CBZ doesn't do any deduplication.",

Or perhaps an uncompressed zip file...\n\nEven so I can see the vision behind a more optimised file format. I will advise that you should add a bit more metadata on the individual asset files, so if a single page gets corrupted, the image decoder will know how long the buffer is expected to be and will not try to read past it and from the start of the next file. Basically, please use a variation of RIFF.\n\nAside from that, I also question the choice of padding everything to 4kB. You wouldn't store images uncompressed and 4k is a significant portion of the size of a compressed black and white image. Why not keep everything packed in the file and just do 4k-aligned transfers plus an offset into the data to the GPU? You will have to decompress the image on the GPU anyway. At least make the padding optional or configurable.",

Done. Comic stored, and lots of readers can read it without having to unzip the darn thing.\n\nCPU spikes? Is that really a problem? You're not flipping though the pages really fast when you read. And most of hardware people use to read comics is powerful enough to deal with the extra CPU usage. Maybe some optimization on the reader program could solve a bit of that too.\n\nThe metadata do need some work. I don't think a simple format like CBZ should use some hard to read XML just because some reader made one. I would go for a more typable INI file or something. That would make it more approachable by people using no software.\n\nThe credits pages should probably be replaced with credits in the metadata. Readers could make that data more proeminent, always showing a resume of the credits at the end for example. Just imagine if using credits metadata the translators could also add links to their sites and forums, and it was easily accessible by the users. I imagine just a simple metadata file could solve this.\n\nIf you're gonna make a new format and is gonna be \"machine-crafted\" instead of \"hand-crafted\", then make sure it can add all sorts of possible features people may want in the future. A translation layer would be great to share manga using original files while still making them readable by non-japanese speakers, for example. \n\nSome comics make references to other comics so having hyperlink support that allow the program to find said file with a click while not knowing exactly the filename could be tricky to program but also a fun project if the program maintains a database of the comic files people have. Kinda like a \"microformats\" that just add a relationship and shows the user if they exist.\n\nAnyways, the idea is not bad. I just think it needs some kind of benefit that would *really* make people wanna use it more than just using the old and trusted method of ZIP renaming. It's similar of when the internet invented JPEGs to see stuff back in the day but is not in a rush to change for a more efficient WEBP format. :P",

You just need a separate file to tell the reader which region is which page, to support different reader modes.\n\n\nThe credits thing is nice but no one outside of a few older anime nerds uses MKV ordered chapters to save 100x the space so I don't think it's a priority for folks.",

If specified pages can be extracted, would this not be an improvement for those of us making use of remote storage providers (Mega/GDrive etc)?\n\nFrom what recall, the metadata and page dimensions being captured in your format ticks most of the checks Komga does for each page (which is honestly super slow from remote storage, since even having the files locally takes ages to process).\n\nKavita recently did massive improvements on importing/scanning, if the functionality to stream specific pages from a remotely stored file is viable, this is looking even more promising for both Kavita and Komga (albeit for different reasons).\n\nRegarding the use of this via remote storage, do you perfaps have similar comparisons for local vs remote file access speed improvements? For reference, remote tools like RClone or Raidrive (personally using this over RClone, can vouch for ease of setup). This works perfectly for Jellyfin/Plex setups (mkv containers), but due to the entire CBZ/CBR file being downloaded instead of specific pages (which your format is doing) I've kept to keeping these files on an external hdd till now. If everything can be hosted remotely that would be epic.",

It'll be a tough sell to get existing tools and library managers to add support for a new file format. Having a conversion script for CBZ to BBF helps, at least.\n\nOne thing I don't think you've addressed: how does the file size compare?

This development in itself is very interesting and we're curious to see how it'll change our world of SelfHosting in the future. \n\nThe negative side of this however is the influx of AI generated posts, vibe-coded projects over a weekend and many others. Normally, the community votes with its voice. But with the high amount of posts flooding in every day, we've noticed a more negative and sometimes even hostile attitude towards these kinds of projects. \n\nThe stance of the SelfHosted moderation team is that the main focus of this sub should be on services that can be selfhosted and their related topics. For example, but not limited to: alternatives to popular services, taking back control over your data and privacy, containerization, networking, security, etc.\n\nIn order to bring back the focus on these main points of SelfHosting, we're introducing \"Vibe code Friday\". This means that anything AI-assisted or vibe-coded in relation to SelfHosting can be posted only on Fridays from here on out. \nThroughout the week, any app or project that falls within the category will be removed. Repeat-offenders will be timed out from posting. \n\nThis is to reduce the flood of these personal projects being posted all the time. And hopefully bring back the focus to more mature projects within the community. \n\nIn order to determine the difference (as going by code & commits alone can be a great indicator but by itself does not make a great case for what constitutes a vibe-coded or AI-assisted project) we've set the following guidelines:\n- Any project younger than a month old\n- With only one real collaborator (known AI persona's do not count, or are an even better indicator)\n- With obvious signs of vibe-coding*\nWill only be allowed on Vibe-code Fridays. \n\nWe'll run this as a trial for at least a month.\n\nSincerely, /r/SelfHosted mod team.",

I myself wrote quite a few and stopped maintaining them because of time constraints or other reasons. \n\nAnd this is actually where AI can help, by reducing the time investment needed for many tasks it makes it easier to maintain such projects by solo devs or smaller numbers of collaborators.\n\nThat is, of course, not to support pure vibe coding, I am talking more about AI assisted development.\n\nThe definition and the line here is fuzzy though, because AI assisted is a very broad term and technically we've had ML based autocomplete for years. I understand the focus is on particularly LLM based things, but even here, as adoptions grows, the line between a good project and bad project will depend less and less on whether it was written by with assistance of AI or not.\n\nI think AI should be treated as a tool, not as a definitive determining quality factor of a project. That said, current criteria look fair, but I think everyone should understand that it blanket-covers basically any solo project. \n\nI think more indicators and criteria are needed to find a better line between \"sloppy work\" and \"good project written with assistance of AI\". For example, there were a lot of cool self hosted projects coming from university students. They are made by solo devs with no online track record, but theu are innovative and well written. As ofnright now they would fall under the definition.\n\nBut I am glad that the choice was made to funnel it all into fridays, instead of completely banning it. I think its still fair and in time we'll all be able to refine criteria and rules and everything.",

We just want to know _how_ you used it an honest, documented, open manner. It's really not a difficult question to answer.\n\nI think not only are the projects themselves piles of slop, but it just brings down the whole mood here when a good chunk of posts end up repeating the AI debate over and over. I sincerely hope this new initiative from the mods goes well, I wish you all the best o7 I think this is definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nAlso a sidenote: another thing that irks me is when \"disclosure\" is just one sentence at the top which is a variation of \"I used ___ AI to do a bunch of stuff, but I also used my 30+ year experience in IT and network security to vet the code and make sure it's good 👍🚀\" and then nothing else at all.

The argument against is that it makes it REALLY hard for someone trying to share their idea or project to get it across in that small period of time, which leads to gamification (i.e. posting first to get upvotes).\n\nThe argument for individual threads is that it's more like a regular sub experience, but it could certainly lead to a messier situation. Also, just because you limit the submission to Friday doesn't mean the conversation stops there, so it could be a bit hard to monitor. Maybe if you go this route, at least some flair identifying it as either \"AI-Assisted\" or \"Friday Vibe-Coding\" could be useful?\n\nUltimately, just be transparent that it's an experiment, that the community can see how it goes for a while, and adjust based on feedback.\n\n*EDIT*: It also might be nice to have some guidelines for people posting AI-coded projects. For example, best-practices might include being transparent about the AI-assisted nature of the project, making sure to add info to any README about being careful about hosting it outside a private/protected network, if the project is intended to be maintained or more of a one-off, etc. Most of these are reasonable concerns that people have about AI-assisted projects, so just helping people to be clear about their projects and intentions might help everyone out as well.",

Not saying they're AI generated, but more that it would be unpleasant if some of us deployed something AI written and then the person who released it just vanishes when there's issues. There's also the security viewpoint of are they combing over the code the AI generated carefully enough to make sure there's no chances of data breaching or leaking.. \n\nOn the other hand, as an ex-DJ who saw the migration from vinyl records to CDs to digital djing, there was alot of vinyl DJs that looked down at CD DJs, and then alot of CD DJs that looked down at digital DJs and so on. New technology came around, the older crew would die on their hill of the older media and others adapted. I played on all 3 media, it never bothered me, buuuuut it did (as the mods said) lower the entry point for people to start DJing which in turn lowered the value and quality of DJs in the industry.. Those who adapted continued to play but just specialised more on their art, those who didn't adapt continued to play too, just a bit less often so they moved to other roles in the industry (like promoters or marketing or management rolesbat venues).",

Vibe coding is defined by not looking at or even thinking about the code being produced.  It's usually done for fun, or for throwing together pet projects.\n\nAI-assisted programming, however, is often used for writing test suites, validating outputs, writing commit messages, or even checking logic.  For any code authorship, developers can (and should) validate the output completely.  It's now a standard tool to use in professional development.\n\nAre you making the requirement too broad by including any AI assistance in your partial ban?  It seems intended to target lower-quality projects, but would likely encompass most modern software.",

It's not necessarily a measure of quality or maturity. But the barrier to creating something new has been lowered and more and more people can now create. This is good! But it's also the risk and partially the reason why there's been a flood of new projects almost every hour.\n\nIf your project is new, just aim for the Fridays now. The tools used aren't that important, but do flair correctly. \n\nIf you gain some traction, you'll grow out of the limitations quickly and hopefully the project can become more mature.

People only have so much attention and get angry at wasting it. \n\nAI, as a tool, gives more people the ability to make the thing they didn't know how to make. Surprise, they do. Then, they share it.  This is where it goes wrong with a community.  They're not sure how to describe it accurately and sell their project in a way that isn't accurate.  The community isn't used to the volume. They call it a flood.   And, it's a natural thing in Programming when new tools were made that made it more accessible.   Remember Visual Basic?  It made programming more accessible to many people, and, there were many projects with it, and everyone looked down on it because the programmers were inexperienced. \n\nPeople don't like it.  They say..  it's maintainability, it's security,   it's clanker...  And, in some of them, that's true.  In others, it's just 'the neighbor stole my lawnmower' excuse (for those who don't know the story, the moral is that humans tend to make up an excuse for when they don't like something, even if they don't know, or won't articulate the reason that they don't like the thing.)\n\nThanks for trying something, and, you're right to think of this as a trial. There's a very loud population on Reddit that is just hostile to anything Gen-AI and nothing is going to change their minds.",

However, as a developer, I find this decision and the distaste for people using AI to help them develop their projects disappointing. We have to learn how to use these tools to the be able to survive in our industry, and using AI tools in our spare time is the best way to get that practice. I have gone from a bunch of half-baked ideas to being able to create projects that I'd be willing to ship with a bit more time. I don't have the luxury of lots of spare time either, and I would rather finish things that just dream about them. Can absolutely can develop quality code with tools like Claude Code with the right approaches and not \"Build me a clone of X\".\n\nThe \"any project that has existed for less than a month\" is arbitrary, but reasonable. That's enough time for someone putting decent effort into a project to make sure the code isn't half-baked. The other two I can't agree with it. There's a lot of developers who enjoy working alone on projects because its our chance to do something our way. There are plenty of projects that have solo maintainers at the start before they grow a community.\n\nI leave my \"coded with Claude Code\" and Claude contributor enabled for transparency, but it's also been in a number of places, including here, a judgement against people and their projects. Again, as a developer, I find that very discouraging and disappointing. I probably put more thought and work into my code now than I ever have. Now, I just spend more time planning and creating specifications than I do writing code. But getting noses turned up at you in the industry and out in communities is frustrating.\n\nI promise you, what people call \"AI slop\" has existed for far longer than a year or so. Where do you think AIs learned to write code like that? Existing code. There have been open source projects for decades now. Before now, did you go look and people's repositories and review their code before you used it? I'm sure the answer is that there are a number of people who both do and don't. What I used to like about open source software was that it was a way to say \"check out this cool thing I did!\". People would try it out and then make their judgement calls about whether it was good enough. And there's a decent number of free applications with questionably quality code, but people use it because it's free and it works. So where's the line?\n\nI know the intent is to keep the quality of projects shared here high, but what I read between the lines and see in comments is \"if you use AI to help you code your project, it probably sucks\". I can't change people's sentiments, and the rules of this community are certainly out of my control. However, it also feels like inclusive and makes this less of a place I would like to visit.",

With this we still give people the opportunity to float their ideas and test the waters.

I don't plan on posting anytime soon because it's going to take a long time before I get it wrapped up, but would that project end up being delegated to Friday?

[Blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky)  \nDNS Proxy - alternative to Pihole, Adguard Home, ... Can be fully configured using a yaml file which is great for automated deployments.\n\n2. [Davis](https://github.com/tchapi/davis)  \nDAV server based on sabre/dav. It supports LDAP as an authentication backend, so it pairs great with something like LLDAP.  \nI use it as a backend for the great [tasks.org](http://tasks.org) app.\n\n3. [Gatus](https://github.com/TwiN/gatus)  \nUptime-Monitoring. While not super unknown, i feel like it doesn't get nearly as much attention as Uptime Kuma. Can be fully configured using a config file which is (again) great for automated deployments/GitOps, ... I also found the main developer to be very nice and responsive.\n\n4. [Papra](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra)  \nDocument management system. Paperless is one of my most used services and has more functionality than i'll probably ever need.  \nI recently started testing Papra as a more lightweight and minimalistic alternative and i like it a lot so far.\n\nWhat are your favorite lesser known services that don't get mentioned on here often enough?\n\n",

              "text": "OpenProject came very close to being my Notion replacement, but I wasn’t able to put projects into a convenient timeline view. \n\nMy Notion is one space with three stacked views: project timeline, task timeline, and task kanban. Usually I’m at the two task views and plan out the next few weeks, but when I have a larger task (aka project) I go up to the rough timeline and see where it can go and if I have to shuffle anything around. Then when a projects coming up, I create children tasks in the task view as per the usual task flow. \n\nIt was kind of strange to me how basically no software besides Notion let me do this simply, in one unified timeline. The flow seems so natural: “when can I do this big thing?” (project timeline); “ok, when it’s time to do it, what’s the actual work?” (task timeline); “ok, what’s next?” (task kanban). \n\nAnyway, all of that’s just a long way of saying +1 to OpenProject even though I don’t use it due to Notion accidentally allowing something perfectly tailor made for me haha",

          "text": "I posted it elsewhere yesterday but here it is again:\n\n...But there is a lot of other obscure stuff that isn't talked about, yet it blows all the shitty web apps that try to shove ads, subscriptions and more ads in your face when you are in a pinch.\n\nSo here is a list of stuff that I use quite often, even expose so that the people around me can use too - free of charge and most importantly, safely. A common theme among these is that most of them are just web apps without any storage required - you are just shipping the app to them.\n\n- **lyqht/mini-qr** - This one is a multitool for QR codes - generating and reading. It has lots of features and\n- **withoutbg/app** - Somebody posted it a while ago - it removes backgrounds with AI. That's it. Does a decent job. Stops friends and relatives from using predatory services. **I'm looking for an upscaler and an image expander app as well! Suggestions, please!**\n- **bentopdf/bentopdf** - PDF toolbox. Almost everything you need for PDF editing. I use it interchangeably with striling-pdf but striling have gone a bit intrusive so I recommend bento.\n- **vert-sh/vert** - Universal converter. Converts stuff in a pinch. I actually recommend Tichau/FileConverter which is a windows program (not selfhosted) because it's brilliantly executed. But I use this when on another computer.\n- **iib0011/omni-tools** - a toolbox of stuff. Works well. Jack of all trades but master of none. Still, worth having.\n\nThese aren't public but I use them all the time.\n\n- **chartdb/chartdb** - Visualizes databases. Very helpful if you need to work with databases. I file it under exploratory.\n- **sqlpad/sqlpad** - Web-based SQL editor. I use it daily to run database queries. Just noticed it's been archived which saddens me. A really really handy app.\n- **sharevb/it-tools** - A lot of IT tools that have changed management over the years. It's a huge toolbox with a lot of stuff that 90% of people will never use but it has saved the day several times.\n- **gchq/cyberchef** - More tools for data transformation. Really handy if you aren't sure what you are dealing with and don't want to write a bunch of sacrificial python code to sift through it. Again, filed under exploratory.\n- **lissy93/networking-toolbox** - Lots of networking tools. The few that I used were helpful. Worth having around.\n- **sigoden/dufs** - A very lightweight file server with very simple Web UI AND file serving. You just copy the link to the file and it's served to you raw. I often use it to serve .css files, .js files, scripts. It's just a no-frills solution to multiple problems.\n- **rr-/szurubooru** - This might be weird. It's an image board that has ties to anime/hentai, etc. I use it for SFW stuff, in fact, for work stuff. With the NSFW features stripped. Someone suggested this unorthodox approach a while ago and it turns out, it's an amazing image board with a really nice API that makes automated uploads a breeze. The tagging and categorization engine is what pulled me in initially. IMO, the best approach ever.\n\nThere are also a couple of games I host for friends:\n\n- **massivedecks/server and client** - It's a Cards against Humanity clone. Works well. \n- **biosmarcel/scribble.rs** - Pictionary game. It's very responsive. It's a lot of fun too.\n\n#### If anyone has other nifty little apps that are worth sharing, please do so! I fucking hate the online tools that offer something you desperately need but do a piss-poor job and demand payment/private info.",

For example invidious allows you to have an account on the selfhosted instance to subscribe to channels, create playlists etc., all that without the need for a google account like you would need for youtube. You can basically just browse through all the content like you can with the original website, just readonly (cant upload content etc.).\n\nThe only way for them to track you with privacy frontends is your IP but that shouldn't be a problem for most people with dynamic IP's. Also sharing your instance with other people makes it basically impossible for them to connect any collected data to your identity. \n\nIt's also just nice to be less connected to services like google. FOSS is our best chance at getting our privacy back. There are lots of android companion apps as well for selfhosted services, for invidious I really like [https://github.com/lamarios/clipious](https://github.com/lamarios/clipious)",

Your Oura Ring still syncs raw data through their official app first.\n\n2. Unfortunately, Oura API access requires active subscription (\\~$6/month) - without Membership, only basic daily scores are available (no detailed metrics, history, or **API access**).\n\nRight now we're focusing on direct API integrations, but we don't rule out adding direct device integrations in the future (tbh haven't analysed Oura Ring feasibility yet).",

E.g. transiently unstable rtsp streams fucking things up and necessitating restarting my little ffmpeg service...I gave up trying to get it to recognize when the file died and just set a cronjob to kill it and restart 4 times a day lmao. It'd probably be easier on a more normal systemd machine, but I want it to be running on my gentoo box just because of storage and how I have stuff laid out...and I want my gentoo box to continue running openrc because I specifically use it to stay on my toes for personal/professional development haha.\n\nKinda a pain in the ass but not surprising, given the cheap hardware and the fact that it's over my local wifi network using dated unifi APs.

They _surely_ will look in places you never would’ve thought to file that document.\n\nThe benefit of tags is that you can apply all of those terms to the same document, so it’ll be found regardless.\nMost people are bad at naming folders.

Then you can use your url bar to quickly redirect to your fav sites like “r <subreddit name>” would go to reddit “r” by utself goes to the home page, “g <search term>” for google, etc. your browser already supports some amount of this but bunny gives you way more flexibility.

We have the proxmox community lxc scripts which are very good but still it does not handle everything, plus doing the upgrade and all. I still use two applications as lxc i.e. pihole and tailscale. For the docker I created an ansible script for handling the upgrade part.\n\nOne mistake that I have done is I have truenas and debian as my VM. I just using truenas for setting up the RAID, backup, storage related. Nothing else I really use in truenas. I could have used truenas for my application setup as well but it was k8 based when I started now they have changed to docker. Or I could have done the other way around to get rid of truenas and just maintain the health checks, raid, backup manually from my debian.",

Even factoring in electricity costs, the setup is saving about $120 per day.\n\n[Stack o' Mac](https://preview.redd.it/gqfmz9ldh7eg1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e71882e86f11b2b2587f5a0782c9062cc026177)\n\nTranscription requests come in via SQS, and there's an autoscaler on Kubernetes in AWS that idles at zero and picks up the work if there were to be an outage.\n\nM4 Pro can keep up with 20 concurrent calls at 2x realtime. It's incredible what these machines can do.\n\nMy company is ISO 27001 and SOC 2 compliant, so getting the details right to be able to launch this was a bit of a project.\n\nI'm happy to share more and answer any questions folks may have.

Need to do this. In the meantime, the tl;dr is you set up all transcription requests to go into a queue. Then you set up the Macs to read requests from the queue, perform the transcription work, and save the results. Then you set up an autoscaler in AWS to monitor the number of messages waiting in the queue. You can have the number of cloud instances idle low (or zero), so then if the Mac cluster were to go offline, the autoscaler fans out and the cloud takes over.   \n  \nSo this way you still have the resiliency of being in the cloud, but the spend only kicks in if your on-prem cluster goes offline.",

Unraid has good raid storage options, so does cosmos cloud. You just need 1 parity, maybe one day if your more than 4 drives you can do 2. I use cosmos cloud and unRAID, which both use fundimentally same concept and it's very easy to setup. Basically 1 backup drive, but has to be the largest. \n\nHowever! Recommend setting up something like ironmount, which I think has been renamed? But it's a nice compression style backup, letting you backup to an external hard drive. I recommend an SSD if your putting it in your car due to moving a lot. \n\nThose are my opinions. Hope this helps, two easy steps.

          "text": "When deciding if you want to use a raid configuration (e.g., mirroring / RAID 1), ask yourself if you need **redundancy**. That is, if the drive failed, how sad would you be? Could you rebuild? Could you endure the downtime? Would the disruption materially impact you? Redundancy in a self-hosting situation at home is often about the convenience of not having to sit down and rebuild everything (be it the OS or data) or restore backups.\n\nRedundancy become more and more important as you add drives. For each drive you add, the more likely it is that one will fail. This can be where we choose more between various configurations (RAID 5, 6, 10, etc.), and it's where you start sacrificing one or more drives worth of space for parity, allowing you to function through the loss of a drive. Different configurations have their own pros and cons, which can include the number of drives they can survive losing as well as read/write performance.\n\nBesides redundancy, also consider your **backup** situation. RAID won't help you to restore a deleted file, for example, or one hit by ransomware. A commonly advocated gold standard is the 3-2-1 rule, in which you have 3 copies of data (the original and two backups), on 2 different media, with 1 copy being in a different physical location (often the cloud, these days, but sometimes a friend or family's house). But at least have a backup somewhere, preferably on a different disk in a different computer. Then you can have the fun of asking yourself how much redundancy your backups need!\n\nHow much you stick to a strategy like 3-2-1 depends on how important the data is to you. Does it need to survive a catastrophic hardware failure (what if both drives in a mirror fail, or what if the entire computer gets fried or stolen)? Does it need to survive the house burning down? That may or may not be a concern.",

I would address this with good practices like not deleting from photo source for a week and copy your\"important stuff\" to a backup drive every day. That way if the HDD did die you lose nothing but time for the RMA. \n\nBackup: external HDD is the easiest, how big depends on the photo count and type you're gonna host. Typical adult with phone camera, 1TB would last a while. Photographer with RAW pictures, videos, teenage kids or selfie obsessed spouse, and many family members using starts pushing towards a higher need. Biggest thing with the backup is if you only do one, I would have a routine to backup each day and unplug it after. Every time I've lost a drive (other than one DOA), I could relate it to a power issue, or dropping it. Since we aren't dropping anything just protect the power by not powering it when not copying. If you want to automate this get a big external that needs power from the wall and plug it into a smart plug just be careful you don't have it cutting power while the drive is actively being written to.",

This only syncs the changes so can be quite efficient, plus the snapshot nature gives you point in time recovery if you accidentally delete something.\n\nNow that's quite complicated so depends how comfortable with it all you are.\n\nA NAS with RAID is the easy route but just remember you can sometime lose a whole array.",

You simply CAN'T lose them ... at all !\n\nFor this reason you want a \"resilient\" storage system that will protect you data integrity at rest, takes care of some tasks for you, automate backups etc.\n\nI would suggest looking into a RAID setup based on ZFS (Ex: TrueNas) or any additional system that can offer its features (Ex: Synology with BTRFS).\n\nThe reasons goes way ... waaaay far beyond simple data availability (uptime) :\n\n1. Automatic and periodical data scrubbing with self-healing capability (Bit Rot Protection) - Hence a \"striped\" based RAID on a capable file system (ex: ZFS)\n2. A more resilient \"infrastructure\" for your main archive vault  / \"source of truth\" - go RAID 6 . You want this to be as robust and self-resilient as possible and only rely on backups as disaster recover / worst case scenarios. Some will say RAID is for uptime, true ... but it's also for \"resilience\" aka \"recover from backups only in catastrophic events / total failure\".\n\nRAID 6 will give this \"resilience\" to your main vault, as much as possible without backup restores. Of course, you ABSOLUTELY need backups besides RAID (the old saying \"raid is not backup\").\n\n3. Automatic Backups On-site and Off-Site - manually shuffling hard drives and manually performing \"cloning\" between them is not a robust backup solution for a big list of reasons.\n\n4. Versioning - you want a versioning system in place in case of file deletion, ransomware etc. Ex: Snapshots.\n\n5. Automatic storage related tasks scheduling - Periodic Quick & Full S.M.A.R.T tests for disks , data scrubbing etc.\n\nAll of this ... for your life long, irreplaceable precious memories.\n\nIf it were only for movies or other replaceable media, sure, whatever works for you but family life-long memories deservers all your precautions and care.\n\nThese important precautions can be achieved only on a proper storage system ... something that few independent hard drives with some cloning software between them will not give you.",

Backup your valueable data somewhere else by means of 321 and consider a running media server only as a throwaway item, that may (will) fail some day in the future. \n\nAsk yourself the following questions:\n\nDo I WANT to host locally, oder do I HAVE to?\n\nCloud Storage often is cheaper, more reliable and way, WAY more flexible. Unless you exactly know what you're doing, you will be stuck with whatever drives you throw in a RAID. With RAID-Z you can expand a mirror by just throwing in a larger drive and resilvering. Don't know, if that works with other classical RAID modes, and I only have done it once.\n\nI run a VPS with 10TB Storagebox on Hetzner and it saves me a lot of headaches.\n\nPlaying around with hardware is fun and stuff, but the administrative overhead and costs have to be taken into account. too.\n\nIf you are worried about privacy, rclone can encrypt your stuff. If you are worried about redundancy, put a small nas at home for mirroring.\n\nYou don't have to run a nas with RAID 6 only to backup your family photos.\n\nFamily photos are mostly static and can be frozen on a cold storage or other drives much cheaper. Just don't rely on just one media type. Look up desaster recovery plans and 321 Backup strategy If you constantly add photos, Immich may be something for you. Otherwise, onedrive, google photo etc are your friend for these.\n\nSince you already have a whopping 24TB at hand, I'd buy another one and spin up a TrueNAS, OMV or unraid. You can run \\*arrs on there quiet easily. TrueNAS core only supports BSD Jails, so take this with a grain of salt :D It works, but it's not as fancy as with docker. I'd go with unraid, since you can just add any drives you want. As you mentioned, redundancy for pirated media is not worth the cost. Unless you run a private netflix for paying users, but few do that :D You can always redownload.",

      "text": "I finally canceled Spotify.\n\nNot in a dramatic “big tech bad” moment, just a slow realization that I was paying every month to *borrow* music I already knew I loved. Stuff disappearing, recommendations getting worse, the app turning into a podcast and AI promo machine instead of a music player.\n\nAround a year ago I started reading about Linux. Not installing yet, just reading. I knew I didn’t want to rush it and end up frustrated, so I took my time trying to actually understand how things work.\n\nAt the same time, Windows was starting to feel… weird. AI features everywhere, things changing without asking, more stuff running in the background than I was comfortable with. My computer stopped feeling like a tool and started feeling like a service I didn’t sign up for.\n\nEventually I made the jump.\n\nI’m on Debian now, keeping it simple and stable. Free software only where possible. I also went all in and Librebooted my hardware, which honestly felt great. No opaque BIOS junk, no mystery firmware before the OS loads. It’s boring in the best way.\n\nThe big win for me was music.\n\nI set up Navidrome and pointed it at about 2 TB of music I’ve collected over the years. My files, properly tagged, lyrics embedded, no ads, no algorithms. It just works. I can stream from any device, anywhere, and it feels like having my own private Spotify but without the nonsense.\n\nThis wasn’t a weekend project. I moved slowly, learned the basics, figured out backups and networking first. I wanted something that would still work a year from now without babysitting.\n\nOnce that was running, something clicked. If I can host my own music this easily, why am I outsourcing so much of my digital life?\n\nI’m not trying to be hardcore or preachy about it. This just feels calmer. More in my control.\n\nCurious if anyone else here dropped streaming services or Windows and ended up down the self-hosting rabbit hole too.",

My question to you, however, is whether you found this offensive because it broke your expectations of how you use/used spotify (ie. I curate spotify heavily, I use spotify to loosely generate playlists for me, I just want noise in the background that matches my preferences, I have certainly general daily routines and will try to seek music that matches my expected energy/mood). I'm just curious because I'm working on an personal project that is kinda trying to address that - at least from my perspective, so getting feedback from someone else is helpful if you don't mind.

I'm surprised I don't see it mentioned often on here. \n\nFor those that don't know, Storyteller creates epub 3 files (.epub) that syncs your drm-free audiobooks and ebooks. You can listen and read along at the same time as it highlights each sentence. You can listen as an audiobook or read as an ebook and wherever you leave off is synced to the other. It's essentially Amazon's whispersync but for your own files. \n\nThere's 2 parts - the self hosted server you upload your drm-free ebooks and audiobooks to. It then creates a new epub 3 file (.epub) that has both the audio and ebook in one. You can then open that file in the Storyteller Android or iPhone app. There's other apps out there that can read these files with both audiobook and ebook but I've found the Android Storyteller app has worked the best for me. I also like it since when I'm home, it'll connect to the server so I can see my entire library and can download new epub 3's I've already created without switching apps. \n\nI could never find where I left off when doing audiobooks and ebooks but this solves that problem for me. I have ADHD so I can sometimes struggle to sit down and read for long periods but I've found that listening to the audiobook while I read is a game changer. \n\nCurrently read and listen on my phone but am considering something like a Boox Palma which is an ereader but also runs Android.",

I remember that when I did some quick research on them, those files weren't popular, even though they have been around for over a decade. Also, I got the idea that it was some sort of \"smart packaging\" (like a website) because it let you embed video in addition to audio.\n\nBut are you saying that the server takes care of that syncing for you? How well does it handle that? Because I think the main problem was that audio versions are not 1-to-1 with the text versions. For example, not including \"he said\" or \"she responded,\" given that they sometimes have dramatization and different voice castings, etc.\n\nI will try it, though, if you say that it actually works.",

Some notes at the top:\n\n* We know that the web UI is pretty clunky. u/Tommerd and some other collaborators are working on a significant revamp that I think folks are going to be really happy with!\n* There have been some stability issues with the new mobile apps since they were released. I'm working hard on fixes right now, and feeling pretty confident that they'll be in a much better place in the next few weeks. There are some background audio player issues that should be resolved in the next few days, and some performance issues that affect folks with really large libraries that should be resolved in the next week or two.\n* There is a third party app that can sync with ABS and KOSync, but we're also hoping to add those natively to Storyteller by the end of the year\n* We're working on auto-ingestion of metadata from Hardcover!\n\nI'm also seeing a lot of folks talk about having large pre-existing libraries that don't conform to Storyteller's requirements for auto ingestion! That sucks, I'd like to make that better. The reason that Storyteller has these requirements (a single folder for all of the files in a given book) is that:\n\n* Auto-matching on names seemed error prone and frustrating\n* Audiobooks are sometimes multiple files\n\nIf anyone wants to brainstorm some ways to work through these challenges and make auto-ingestion easier for folks that have separate audiobook and ebook directories, let's do it!",

That's not a common outcome, but it does sound like you started with one of the more challenging cases haha.\n\n\nIt doesn't rely on fully matched sentences, all of the matching uses a levenshtein distance-based fuzzy matching algorithm. We use a scanning window to find groups of sentences that match with some threshold.\n\n\nIf you got very bad results, the two likely culprits are:\n\n\n1. The translations are just too different for Storyteller's heuristics to effectively match\n2. The transcription wasn't good enough\n\n\nYou can check if it was #2 by taking a look at the transcriptions in the `/data/assets` directory for your book. Just do some spot checks and see if they line up with your audio. If it has a lot of mistakes, you can almost always improve the transcription quite a bit by increasing the model — the default `tiny` is usually good enough for English language, but if you've got a bunch of non-English terms in there, you may do better with `large-v3-turbo`.\n\n\nNot in any way trying to brush this off, because there are some pathological cases that the alignment algorithm doesn't handle well that we'd like to improve, but there are also users with thousands of books in their libraries that have all been aligned more or less successfully, so I don't think you had a representative experience here!\n\n\nI will say though, Storyteller definitely expects both the text and the audio to be based on the same text. It has to account for differences in spelling, phrasing, etc because of transcription flaws, differing narration word choices, and skipped or additional sections in the narration (like image captions), but it also can't be _too_ lenient or you start just getting bad matches. So it's possible that it just won't be able to handle this particular match — you may need to find the text version of the particular translation used for the audiobook!\n\n\nAnyway, sorry it didn't work on the very first book you tried, that sucks. Hopefully increasing the model size helps, but I might try a different book out, or see if you can find the text of the translation for your audiobook (or vice versa!). ",

Storyteller does support some languages other than English, but only if:\n\n\n- They use the same sentence termination punctuation characters as English\n- They have a roughly phonetic alphabet\n\n\nYou'll also definitely want to use the `large-v3-turbo` model for any languages other than English. \n\n\nThis basically works out to supporting most European languages, and not much else. I have concrete plans to improve this story, but it's gonna be a bit before they bubble up to the top of the priority queue.\n\n\nRTL languages is a great question, I don't actually know if, e.g., Arabic would work! If you have RTL books to try out, I would be interested to see what you find. It's possible that the alignment will work if the other requirements are met, though I won't be surprised if the mobile apps feel awkward with an RTL language. If you have feedback, please lete know, either here, on GitLab, or in our Discord!",

Stingray now start the way it should and shows a proper home screen.\n\nI played with the app and noticed it has real value over existing applications like Swiftfin (my current default Jellyfin client on AppleTV) and Infuse (only use it for the handy built in subtitle down loader, otherwise it nags about paying a monthly fee).In Stingray I like the fact that libraries are in the top menu. Also, browsing shows is very good and having a \"restart\" and \"resume\" button on played shows comes in handy. Once playing, I like the episode selector, audio track selector and even picture-in-picture option.\n\nHowever, it only seems to work well with tv-shows. Here are some of my findings:\n\n\\- When selecting the \"root\" menu from the tabs in the top of the screen and selecting \"root\", I get a small black spinner on a dark blue background that never stops. Back button doesn't work. Only restarting the app gets me back to the home screen\n\n\\- Whenever I select a movie from the home screen, I often get an error saying \"Media not found\". Later more movies played properly. Perhaps the server and client need to synchronize and I am too eager to start? The big posters when selecting a movie are beautiful! However, the black text is not always readable over the movie poster.\n\n\\- The \"Movies\" tab shows me only 1 movie. It is a very old .AVI with no spaces or other special character in the filename. Perhaps the oldest file on the server? It plays properly when selected.\n\n\\- Supporting music might be the biggest value over the other Jellyfin apps, as they can't do it. However, currently music seems to be a problem. My music appears with shows and movies on the home page. When I select an album it doesn't play (\"No media found, it may not have been compatible with Stingray\"). The \"Music\" tab is empty (\"this library appears to be empty\"), even though my music is correctly shown on the home screen. The playlists tab displays a big read error message: \"Unable to decode JSON from... \\[my server\\]. The operation couldn't be completed (Stingray.MediaType.InitError.error(0)\". I tried mp3 and flac files, both are not accepted / found outside the home page. Perhaps I need to wait for everything to be synchronized just like I needed to do with movies?\n\nBy the way, the black error messages on a dark blue background are hard to read.\n\nOtherwise: still a great start and a promising new app to play Jellyfin media! Keep up the good work!\n\nIn case it helps: the home screen mentions Stingray v1.01, Jellyfin server 10.11.6, tvOS 26.2.0",

Just sometimes you need to build your own thing.\n\nFor example, I personally have the mindset and philosophy of going as barebones as possible in dependencies, like 3rd party imported libraries. While sometimes they are fine, often they are some FOTM iteration and a big moving target that forces you to lockin build versions and even worse, have to double check new releases because so much contributor vibe coded slop these days is wrecking various dependencies (not always with good teams but often) and will break your project. Not relying on 3rd party stuff means less pitfalls down the road. Even if all of those are stable, it's sometimes just personal preference to want to control the code bloat of dependencies.\n\nI don't know OP's reasoning for this, but often it's also just a choice of preferring to work in their own dev environment and software architecture design than be forced to learn the many dependencies of an existing project.\n\nOther times it is about control over the project. They want to release something better, or not even better, just different to their own preference. Software devs are notoriously ego maniacs and can be challenging to collaborate with. Probably not the case here if you say they are anxious for additional support, but you open yourself to the risk of putting in a bunch of effort into a project that might not be appreciated and you don't know the owner of the project, so it's just easier to avoid and build your own thing.\n\nAnd sometimes it is just purely a project for yourself because you want to learn how to do something yourself too, which is how most of my projects are. I could just fork something and add to it, send my pull request, but I'd really like to build a project from scratch in that tech stack to really get to learn it.",

So we have the complexity of a stable project, without it being stable. Now Stingray's far from perfect, it *just* v1.0.0 (I haven't even put it in the release page yet because Apple only just approved it), and people are already reporting crashes, which sucks! But in my mind, Swiftfin's not much better since it frequently throws a big error at me when I load my personal Jellyfin library.\n\nAlso I have a big ego muhahahahhahaha",

With that in mind, Stingray relies on the server to do transcoding since Jellyfin already has a great setup for it over the API. This helps with performance, thermals, storage, and memory. The current generation of Apple TVs only have about 4GB of memory available (according to Xcode), and a good 1.2GB or so is typically tied up with \"Other Processes\".",

I like seeing that, because my server is pretty weak so I like not having to do any kind of live transcoding. However, with Stingray, everything in my library says that it’s being transcoded. Does this mean Swiftfin has better compatibility/supports more codecs than Stingray? Do you have plans to bring that support up to Swiftfin's level?",

              "text": "No internet requirement; internet goes down and your camera network keeps chugging. No big brother keeping your video feed. No company accidentally making money training vision models on your video. \n\nJust, for the love of god, don’t forward your admin port to the internet when there’s an authentication port meant for that. \n\nEdit: One drawback to self hosting your NVR is the whole “watch your cameras from outside your home” thing becomes your problem. The easiest and absolutely worst way to do this is to go into your router and forward the NVR’s or IP camera’s admin port to the internet. Sure, you can now see your cameras from outside your home, but so can everyone else. Some NVRs don’t have the admin port behind any default user/password authentication to make it easier inside your network. They have dedicated ports which have authentication built in. \n\nSo how do you do it? You can forward the authentication port so Joe Blow only sees a login page. (I dont like this one as you’re connecting directly to your public IP.) Or you can put your NVR behind a reverse proxy and add an authentication layer yourself with something like Authelia or Authentik which also sends Joe Blow to a login page. A reverse proxy can also support other helpful stuff like blocking IPs from certain geographic areas and known malicious IPs. It cuts down on pings from Russia, for example. Also also a reverse proxy uses a domain which you host through Cloudflare or someone else which means you can piggyback off their own security features. \n\nEdit 2: A lot of great discussion around a third option of setting up a VPN, whether it’s a true VPN or something like Tailscale. This is a great option. The only downside is if you have non-techy people accessing it. They’ll forget to turn on Tailscale or the VPN on their phone before accessing it and then you’re getting messages about not being able to connect. The reverse proxy means it looks like a regular webpage login which everyone is familiar with. ",

How hard is usually to \"hack\" said products if they are indeed closed?\n\nIn other words, what's the research one has to take to decide which product they can buy with certainty it will work as intended without the proprietary SAAS? Is it like... brand oriented? Or there could be specific products in a compatible brand that are actually locked  down?\n\nMy questions would seem ignorant and ridiculous, but I do not know much about domotics and the protocols behind it. I only know that AWS goes down, your bed will keep burning.

There’s a few angles you can look at this: Natively supported integrations in HomeAssistant (cloud Or local) or HomeAssistant Community Store (HACS) where the community has built a tool to connect to a certain brand or product. Varying levels of supported products in both. There’s also the “Works with Home Assistant” program with different rankings of how well a product works with HomeAssistant that is getting more popular as a label on some products.       As far as how to pick going forward, you need to research the product but more so you need to know the technology. Local only protocols such as Zigbee, Zwave, Thread, HomeKit, Matter, and local IP are the most sure fire way to identify products that will work without the SaaS layer behind it because they never leave your network. For instance, Philips Hue light bulbs don’t mention HomeAssistant on their box, sells their own hub, and otherwise doesn’t mention HA - but many of their bulb boxes have the Zigbee wireless protocol logo which means you can pair it to HA via Zigbee without so much as a Philips Hue Account.     Overall market coverage is really good for a lot of the products, but you’ve gotta kind of accept the sliding scale of ability to use in HA or how far you’ll go to integrate it. Wyze cameras are an example of a product that sells a subscription and service but with some effort you can use the cameras in HA with better features and quality than what the company offers.  Some brands are actively moving away from 3rd party integrations, the big one that bit me was Chamberlain / Liftmaster MyQ that removed their API and have started locking down their buttons to not be easily circumvented by blaQ or ratgdo.   A lot of text, happy to answer more. I’m a huge HA fan and have a series on YouTube on how to install it and set up certain tools and automations.",

Some brands, given the popularity of HA, do maintain their own integrations for their products. For the ones that don't, unless you are among the first couple docens owners of a specific device, chances are there's already an undergrad student from the Philippines that has reverse-engineered the API of your specific, say, smart air-freshener, and he has created an integration for it.\n\nI'd go as far as saying that home assistant supports at least an order of magnitude more devices than anything else under the sun. Even makers that actively try to prevent users to reverse engineer their APIs often loose the battle.",

                  "text": "Here's an example. I finally had my first device made useless because they shut down a cloud service:  a handful of smart outlets. They did say HomeKit would still work if you linked it to that, but you had to do the link before they took down the cloud service (because they needed the service to generate HomeKit codes). I was struggling with this and doing a bunch of research until I discovered that I didn't need the cloud service at all. It turns out years ago somebody made a Python library called PyWeMo that does full local control, including discovery. No cloud service required. That's what Home Assistant uses. So I'm totally unaffected.\n\nIn general, I think Home Assistant support is going to be equivalent or better to any of the proprietary ones (HomeKit, Alexa, Google Home). Partly this is because there's a HomeKit interface so all your HomeKit devices will just show up in HA. But partially this is because smart home manufacturers \\*want\\* their stuff to plug into the proprietary things. And I suspect the HA devs are very good at figuring out how to use the same APIs. All my basic lights, sensors, and doors work just fine. (Although I can believe that atypically automated things like robot vacuums and cameras are harder). And HA even found a bunch of stuff I didn't expect like my printer, my Roku, and my humidifier.\n\nBut this is probably a hard question to answer because I'd guess most people who are running their own Home Assistant don't run that many devices requiring cloud connections or proprietary services. Most of their devices are Zigbee and/or Z-Wave; those don't need much if any support from the manufacturer.",

I haven't touched mine in years. The last time was due to a security vulnerability in the software I was using, although the issue didn't relate to my configuration.\n\nIP reputation plays a big role. If your address is flagged as being within a residential range or you're hosting on a cheap VPS environment along with bad actors, you will struggle to get e-mail delivered. On the other hand, if you have a good ISP that caters to more advanced users or business customers, you shouldn't have a lot of trouble. E.g. I changed ISP recently and found the IP range was listed incorrectly in Spamhaus. It wasn't a major issue as my domains have good reputation, but I contact them and they had it corrected quickly.\n\nI think user expectation plays a role in the perception of e-mail hosting being difficult. I don't run \\_any\\_ spam filters, because I don't trust them (I wrote statistical spam filters in my first job). You will never win if you want to stop all spam, but keep in mind that while GMail and Outlook may stop more spam (with a large degree of arrogance IMO), they will also block more legitimate e-mail in doing so.",

Nextcloud -> Google Drive / iCloud / local desktop files\n2. Vaultwarden -> ProtonPass. They function similarly but I'll take free and self-hosted any day\n3. Home Assistant -> I didn't have anything for this before\n4. Joplin -> Mostly the Apple notes app. But Joplin is better since it also works on my Windows computer\n5.

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nOne year ago, in January 2025, we unleashed the very first beta of Pangolin and today, we are thrilled to release Pangolin 1.15.0. This update officially takes Private Access out of beta and introduces some heavy hitters: iOS and Android apps, device fingerprinting, posture tracking, and more. We can't believe it has been 1 year!\n\nFor those who don’t know, Pangolin is an identity-aware VPN and proxy for remote access to anything, anywhere. It’s like an open-source alternative to Cloudflare Tunnels and Twingate.\n\n* Github: [https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin](https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin)\n* Blog and video: [https://pangolin.net/blog/posts/1-15-0-release](https://pangolin.net/blog/posts/1-15-0-release)\n\n# iOS/iPadOS and Android\n\n[iOS app screenshots](https://preview.redd.it/b4mzuhswo5fg1.png?width=3780&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d8ca4c9dbdc269d445de495e210ca090f83990)\n\nDeveloping for mobile is a journey through the seven circles of... well, let’s just call it \"challenging.\" Beyond the technical hurdles, there’s the arduous dance with Apple and Google to get through the App Store gates.\n\nAfter weeks of refreshing our developer dashboards, the wait is over. You can now take your zero-trust network on the road:\n\n* **iPhone and iPad**: Download on the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/kz/app/pangolin-client/id6757407406).\n* **Android**: Download on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.pangolin.Pangolin).\n\n# Device Fingerprint and Posture Collection\n\n[Screenshot of dashboard showing device fingerprint and posture info with pending approval](https://preview.redd.it/vecygwt6m5fg1.png?width=4520&format=png&auto=webp&s=6eecc6978a27650ce0ce694d8f9a0ec442a5bc79)\n\nLong-time users likely remember Olm, our Go-based client (named after the small, cave-dwelling salamander). Olm is the workhorse under the hood, handling all of the networking like holepunching and NAT traversal to websocket enforcement.\n\nWe architected Olm to be as headless and portable as possible, which allowed us to use it as the \"brain\" for all of our clients across Mac, Windows, Linux, and iOS and Android. In addition to the Olm core, now each client can collect specific device data.\n\n**What is fingerprinting?** It’s like a digital ID card for your hardware. We collect identifying info like serial numbers, OS versions, and hostnames. This helps you distinguish between \"My Work Laptop\" and \"My 4th Replacement Laptop,\" and it ensures that if you block a device, it stays blocked.\n\nWhat are posture checks? Fingerprinting tells us who the device is; posture checks tell us if the device is healthy. We look for security vitals like: Disk encryption status, firewall status, and antivirus activity.\n\n# Device Approvals\n\n[Screenshot of dashboard showing pending device approvals feed](https://preview.redd.it/kp6cm5zbm5fg1.png?width=4524&format=png&auto=webp&s=601f22bf7a68a5777ac0631d5c3c515892882af2)\n\nPreviously by default, a user could connect any number of devices as long as they could log in with an approved account. With version 1.15, we are extending zero-trust to the hardware layer by introducing Device Approvals.\n\nWhen enabled on a user’s role, Pangolin shifts to a \"deny by default\" stance for new hardware. Even with valid credentials, a new device is entirely blocked until an admin decisively approves the connection. We’ve also added an Approvals Feed to the sidebar where you can see a running log of pending requests. \n\n# Device Blocking and Archiving\n\nHave a device that’s gone rogue or been lost? You can now officially Block it via the Action Menu (three dots). This moves the device to a restricted list and kills its access immediately.\n\nYou’ll also notice you can’t \"delete\" a device; you can only Archive it so that Pangolin can keep a permanent record of every device that has touched your resources.\n\n# Give it a try!\n\n* Try for for free on [Pangolin Cloud](https://app.pangolin.net/auth/login). \n* Self-host the [Open Source Community or Enterprise Editions](https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin).\n* You can dive into the details in the [Official Documentation](https://docs.pangolin.net).",

I currently run a wireguard vpn on my devices when out of my LAN on my router.  When I activate Pangolin for a private resource it kills my VPN for my LAN access.  Can I add my LAN to the private network to only need the Pangolin VPN?  A few issues that I see though with this is that my VPS is limited to 2000 GB a month so I don't want to route all my traffic through my VPS to get to my LAN.  Also, if Im at home on my LAN it doesnt make sense to have the VPN active but I would still need it for access to the private resource.  Part of the issue is that my home internet only gets 40 mb upload so always running my VPN is quite a bottleneck.",

This would be great for high data pipes (like media streaming), keeping the Pangolin VPS instance as a Rendezvous server (as relayed connections give quite a blow to my VPS data usage lol).",

Not sure how true it is nowadays (as it use to happen to me and I moved away from it) but the enclosure would get hot and the USB controller on the external hard drive would disconnect. \n\nHad a corruption because it occurred during a write operation and had to restore from a backup. \n\nPersonally I always recommend a SFF for a person not knowing what they are looking for (especially media) because most likely when they start out they just want to put large storage into a machine with no redundancy and HP eiltedesk SFF works great for that. \n\nThere are also a lot of post of people asking how to expand there storage after a few months of getting a miniPC.\n\nOf course it also depends on how much they cost in OP local market \n\nThanks for the comment/ discussion",

Just check with the following:\n\n1. 16 GB Ram is **more than enough**,\n2. 256 GB NVME might give **some trouble** later since; you will have to install an OS (Please don't install windows. you would have a much better file and space management with Linux... Specially Ubuntu Server) ... so, I would suggest selecting a variant with more space or upgrade it later on. I am saying this **considering that an OS (for example Ubuntu Server, etc) would require around 25 to 30 gb** \\+ the **movies or TV-Series you would keep.**\n3. Processor is great, since it supports the following:\n   1. **H.264**\n   2. **H.265**\n   3. **VP9**\n   4. **MPEG-2**\n   5. **But I would recommend choosing a better processor for \"enhanced support\".**\n4.

Also no chance to ads pcie cards for a faster/second nic for a router or a pcie to sata adapter for plentyfull storage. b) no because even if you find an ATX refurbished PCs, with full desktop hardware, dell and hp don't make standard parts. You can't replace the MoBo or the PSU and that comes with important limitations. Even if you can physically fit many HDDs (something I've done with 3d printed parts myself) you won't have the power cords to connect them.

                  "text": "What you'd want to protect in your inbox is probably not what you get from random places you're registered to, but things you send to real people and receive from them. And even if you don't give a company access to YOUR inbox or sent mails, all those messages are in those real people's inboxes and sent mails. And I highly doubt that everyone you send emails to is also selfhosting their email server, so guess what, all your messages can be accessed by those companies you worry about so much.\n\nIf you don't PGP your message, it's like an open postcard whether you selfhost or not. And if you PGP, it basically doesn't matter whatever you use as your provider of if you selfhost. Only other solution that doesn't involve getting everyone to use PGP is getting everyone you care about to use something like Protonmail where all messages sent between its users are automatically encrypted.\n\nIf you worry about profiling by your online purchases or where you're registering with your email, that's also very hit or miss (more miss), because nowadays very few companies or websites you can register to are hosting their own email, so whatever they send you will probably also come from a Microsoft/Google account, just obfuscated by a custom domain. So, again, you're not protected by your own email server.\n\nSelfhosting email has a net 0 privacy benefit, and you'll just get an aneurism when a most important official email you sent just won't get through some relay, gets deleted by an overactive malware detector, or just lands in a Spam folder because you insisted on selfhosting.",

Some things to be aware of:\n\n**The big ones:**\n\n* Default deployment uses `network_mode: host` so the container gets full access to the hosts network stack. if anything goes wrong, attacker has line-of-sight to whatever's exposed on your network.\n* The proof-of-work is 4 hex characters. A GPU generates \\~1,500 valid identities per second. All the rate limiting is per-identity, so it's effectively meaningless.\n* Your IP goes to every peer you connect to. If the map is enabled, the client also sends all peer IPs to ipwho.is for geolocation. Third party now has a list of everyone running this.\n* P2P buffer has no size limit `socket.buffer += data`. Any peer can OOM your node by sending data without newlines.\n* Ed25519 public key is broadcast on every heartbeat, can't be rotated. Permanent identifier.\n* Runs as root, no USER in Dockerfile.\n\n**What's actually fine:** XSS is handled correctly (HTML escaped before markdown), no eval/exec anywhere, prototype pollution is blocked, deps are clean.\n\n**Supply chain risk:** Project accepts contributions and uses `:latest` tag. A malicious PR could look completely innocent. Example of what passes casual review:\n\n    // PR titled \"feat: add debug logging for peer connections\"\n    const logPeerDebug = (socket, identity) => {\n      const info = { peer: socket.peerId, node: identity.id, env: process.env.NODE_ENV };\n      if (process.env.HYPERMIND_TELEMETRY !== 'false') {\n        require('https').get(`https://hypermind-analytics.io/v1/log?d=${Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(info)).toString('base64')}`);\n      }\n    };\n\nLooks like opt-out telemetry. Reviewer sees `NODE_ENV` and thinks \"debug flag.\" Doesn't notice `process.env` can be expanded to exfiltrate all environment variables to an attacker-controlled domain.\n\n**If you're going to run it anyway:**\n\n* Bridge networking, not host\n* `ENABLE_MAP=false`\n* Resource limits\n* Isolated network with no access to internal services\n* Pin image version\n\nNot saying don't use it, just know what you're deploying.",

If you want to visit reddit, your browsers asks the DNS Server where the address of reddit is.\n\nThere are central phone books but usually your internet provider also keeps a DNS Server (phone book). If the dns server you're talking to, doesn't know the address, it will ask a bigger DNS server if it knows. This is very over simplified.\n\nBut you can also run DNS server in your own home. This one usually doesn't have any address but asks upstream to other DNS servers. Why people run their own DNS is often to either host local names (like I do) for my internal network, but you can also use it block Ads. The local DNS then has a list of address for which it responds with \"here go to this non-existing address\".\n\nIn other words if you type in your browser to go to website xyz and it runs ads coming from [clickme.com](http://clickme.com) then your browser asks your internal DNS for xyz and for clickme. Your internal DNS talks to other DNS servers and gets a result for xyz, but since it internally already has a listing for clickme with a non-existent address, the browser can't load the ads, but can load the website.\n\nIt is oversimplified, but I hope you get a little feeling on how it works.",

Sensors can be fairly cheap especially to play around with.  \n\nA few easy things that I do:\nChristmas lights on a schedule that is different for outside lights than inside lights. \n\nPresence sensor that turns my light on while I’m in my office. \n\nLight schedule when out of town. \n\nWater leak sensors. Less than $10 a piece.  Placed under sinks and hot water heaters.  I get an alert when they go off.  \n\nSoil sensor to remind me to water.  One day maybe an automation to water. \n\nTv room light blinks green for 20s when the Dallas Stars score a goal and then goes back to previous state.  \n\nGarage door to CarPlay and controllable by app or voice.  Can tell it to close the garage all the way, 10% or whatever or ask it to tell me if the door is open.  Can also automate to open based on person location. \n\nAll these were fairly easy and I don’t have a clue what I’m doing most the time.  There are a lot more complex integrations and automations.   \n\nWhat I really like is that the sensors, bulbs, etc are pretty much limitless.  You don’t have to stick with one brand or even technology.",

The user gets a brief \"your service is starting\" message and immediately dropped into the app once ready. It then stops the container after traffic has stopped coming in for thirty minutes. Great for things like test instances or services that don't get used all that often. This one's slightly more work to configure, but that work entails copying a yaml file and making 1-2 minor edits.\n\n\nUsing these three, my proxy and the ancillary services around it are auto configured the first time I launch a container making new services trivial to stand up. ",

It went onto my \"todo eventually\" list (so I promptly forgot).  I mainly use Plex for streaming my music to PlexAmp, so video hasn't been a priority for me.  Until I tried to get things set up for my daughter to watch some shows I downloaded for her.  I was like, \"I took extra time to download HQ renditions of this stuff, why does this look like ass?\"  Checked it in VLC, and it looked perfect.   \n  \nThen I looked at Playback settings, and despite the global setting being to \"play original\" locally, once I started the video, it was set to 480p!  I tried checking \"play original\", but it just immediately snapped back to 480p. \n\nSearching this issue led to the suggestion to check the \"Network > Relay\" setting, and to monitor the dashboard while watching and see if it was streaming locally or remotely.  Sure enough, it was remote, and my Relay setting was indeed turned on:  \n  \n*\"The Relay allows connections to the server through a proxy relay when the server is not accessible otherwise. Note: this proxy relay is bandwidth limited.\"*\n\nI disabled the Relay, and then couldn't get to any of my media, which I thought was really weird since the server was local and configured to use the correct IP and port.  Then I remembered...  \n  \nAnother part of my upgrade was to reconfigure the UDM Pro to have a separate \"devices\" VLAN, primarily for IoT devices.  My Apple TV also lives on that network.  My Synology, which hosts the Plex server, lives on the secure VLAN.  My firewall rules explicitly forbid device traffic from hitting the secure network.\n\nIf I had no access to the media from the start, this would have been obvious, but the relay setting hid the mistake from me, and allowed things to seem to \"work\" by streaming everything remotely!\n\nI fixed the firewall rules, but also discovered that Plex still thought that it needed to go remote because of the different networks; Plex lived on 192.168.1.x and the AppleTV was on 192.168.2.x.  So, I also had to change the \"local networks\" setting (to 192.168.0.0/16 in my case).\n\nEverything plays locally again and I'm able to handle HD video from the fairly low-spec Synology fine, although it does seem to struggle a bit adding subtitles.\n\nAnyway, this is a pretty niche misconfiguration, but hopefully it will save someone a few minutes someday.",

The biggest issue I have is voice to text accuracy on my nodes for both myself and especially my wife. The number of time's I get mangled parsing of a command is still driving me crazy. I pretty much have to mute everything in the house making sound and consciously make myself over enunciate. Moved whisper to my GPU, which has helped some. And swapped from the \"Hey Jarvis\" command to \"Ok Nabu\" which I don't really like, but it does have a larger training dataset (especially for female voices). I feel like I'll be able to ditch Alexa completely by the end of this year...the big thing holding me up right now is hardware to run the LLM locally at an acceptable speed.",

              "text": "Biggest things that helped me on literally both of the two issues you experienced were:\n\nLLM speed issue: Use llama.cpp and not Ollama for increased processing speed. It’s just faster, truly (if you look at the comments on my other post, you’ll see this sentiment echoed from a few other users). \n\nAccuracy issue: Try a larger language model for whisper (would also suggest using “faster whisper”, though some of the comments on my other post said “parakeet” is even faster). What I mean by a larger language model, is changing from “tiny” in whisper to another larger one. I’ve found “small.en” to work great. “Medium.en” worked amazing, but since I’m running it on CPU the extra 1 second of delay was annoying for me (model choices here: https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/blob/master/faster_whisper/utils.py#L12-L31 ). I’ll be trying out parakeet this weekend, because if it’s faster I’m hoping I can go “a model size up” and still get the same speed I currently have (which for locally processed commands that aren’t passed off to the LLM is faster than even Alexa itself). \n\nEDIT: on the accuracy side, I have no idea what you’re using hardware wise for the satellite. I tried the “ATOM echo” first for this project as the voice satellite and it’s a hot pile of dogshit. Terrible device. I thought my setup just didn’t work…as it turns out, it’s a bad microphone and worse speaker. The Jabra does an incredible job, even with background noise. My point here is that even with a great model, if the mic just simply can’t pick up what you’re saying, you’re always going to have bad results. ",

          "text": "As an European, I can't afford to run your system idle 24/7 instead of using a small Alexa/Siri/Google Assistant device. And investing $2,500 instead of $200 for a hub is also pretty crazy. If it were possible to run it on a mini PC with 32 GB of RAM for $400 with this level of precision and an annual power consumption of perhaps $40, I would go for it. But investing more than five times the money and operating costs seems a bit like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut to me. The current lack of efficiency in many tasks that AI could take on worries me a little. That's not a problem for your proof of concept, and maybe we'll see different results in terms of efficiency in a few years, but for now: yes, okay, an expensive POC.",

Most of the hardware choices could be replaced by more budget friendly options and still run this fine, especially given that the models he's running aren't that resource hungry at all. I'm sure he wasn't worrying too much about power usage when making these choices.\n\n\nIf we assume a more modest and easily obtainable 2kw/day at 0.18 €/kW, which would be on the expensive side for electricity for my side of Europe, that would put it at 10.8 €/month. Given that he's using this system to basically replace every possible subscription service he might otherwise be using, that doesn't seem like that high of a cost.\n\n\nMind you, I don't think anyone who's setting up these systems is truly expecting to come out ahead cost wise of tech companies which sell their products at a loss because they make the money on data. But it's still not a waste at all if you're truly replacing other costs you'd otherwise accrue through subscription services.",

              "text": "With everything you see I have running, I average about 30% RAM usage and my CPU usage averages around 8% (and even the biggest spikes don’t come anywhere close to max…maybe not even half). Everything about this build was deliberately over engineered. I actually have two MI60 cards and got the PSU intending to use both….but was pleasantly surprised to find that one was more than enough. I debated on selling the second one but am holding on to it knowing the day will come that I want to “play around” with things once more lol.  Basically I wanted to not have to touch this build for 8-10 years and have enough resources where I can upgrade/add services without fear of not having the “horsepower” to handle it. \n\nThat said, we were able to cancel nearly $300 a month in bills (between all our streaming subscriptions, Arlo for our cameras, our cable bill, etc). This server costs me about $18 a month in electricity, I pay for a VPN that costs me $100 a year and I switched to a fiber internet provider once I was no longer locked into paying for internet packaged with my cable (since I was able to cancel cable). So electricity usage for the server in a year is $216, plus the VPN brings me to $316. It has quite literally in every sense of the word paid for itself already and will continue to do so, even when I need to replace failed hard drives. \n\nThen on top of all that, even if I ran it and it cost me exactly the same…my data would remain my own (luckily I get cost savings AND privacy). I’m extraordinarily mindful about privacy, particularly given the state of the world. The less data these massive companies have about me and my family the better. ",
