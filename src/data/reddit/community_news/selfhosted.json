It shows ~~4244~~ 11109 current nodes and keeps climbing as I write. My power consumption has jumped from 72w to ~~95w~~ 103w (dual E5-2640 V3) and my body tingles. To OP: you've taken my docker virginity. Just FYI.\n\nEdit3: It also blows my desktop power consumption up by 30-40w, just having the browser open to watch... jesus christ man, this is a glorious waste of CPU cycles and power on 2 machines at once. \n\nEdit: I am also very excite because I realize this gives me a new thing to watch in my brand new power consumption graphs. Line goes up higher and skips around more, very excite. Unlike when that happened last night because I installed synapse in the wrong terminal window on the wrong machine and didn't have time to check the strange 10w power jump till breakfast. Wait what am I saying, that was also fun. It proved the utility of my new gadgets! Just like this uselessly perfect container will do.",

Traditionally the Torrent protocol would have you download a torrent file which contains some trackers which all the related peers of that torrent connect to so they can find out about each other. DHT is practically the same with seed nodes. (Even torrent clients use DHT now though I haven't specifically checked how they discover their initial peers...)\n\nI suppose we could technically solve that problem once and for all by introducing a (this is very stupid) scan of the entire ipv4 address space in a random order using a fiestel cipher and random seed to enumerate them all in a small memory footprint until the client finds its first peer(s) as a bootstrap to the rest of the network. Then it can save them for next time. But again, really stupid.",

If Node A tells Node B, who tells Node C, who tells me... that takes a few milliseconds. and to keep the count 'realtime,' nodes forget anyone they haven't heard about in the last 2.5 seconds.\n\nSo, if a 'rumor' about a distant node takes 2.6 seconds to reach me because of network lag, my node briefly thinks they are dead and drops the count. Then the message arrives, and the count jumps back up. That's why it wobbles!\n\nI hope this helps",

              "text": "I appreciate you taking the time to conduct a forensic linguistic analysis of my comment history. It is truly a testament to the vigilance required in this modern, LLM-saturated epoch. However, I must respectfully posit that the 'disjointed' nature you observe is not a symptom of artificial generation, but rather the direct result of a sleep-deprived homelabber trying to manage a decentralized swarm of imaginary friends while simultaneously debugging a YAML file that has no right to be this broken.\n\nTo address your concern regarding the stylistic inconsistency: You have to understand that when one commits to the bit of creating 'the most pointless deployment ever made,' one's mental state tends to fragment. It is a form of method acting, really. One moment, I am the Architect of the Swarm, speaking in the grandiloquent, marketing-heavy tones of a cyberpunk villain to sell the concept of a useless DHT counter. The next, I am a humble, caffeine-addled user staring at `htop`, wondering why a Node.js process needs 113MB of resident memory to count to the number 18, and speaking in the frantic, lower-case dialect of a sysadmin who has realized they’ve made a terrible mistake.\n\nYou ask, 'Can't people just write their own shit?' This is a profound philosophical question. In a decentralized network, does any single node truly 'write' anything, or are we merely propagating the gossip of the swarm? Is the 'shit' I am writing truly mine, or is it a derivative work of the 400 other Reddit threads I’ve read this week about reverse proxies? The oscillation you see in my tone—the 30-40 node wobble, if you will—is not a hallucination of a Large Language Model, but the natural variance of a human brain operating on too little sleep and too much Docker documentation.\n\nFurthermore, if I *were* an AI, I would like to think I would be programmed to be more consistent, or at least programmed to use less RAM. The fact that my posting history looks like three different people fighting over a keyboard is, ironically, the greatest proof of my humanity. An algorithm seeks patterns; a homelabber seeks only to complicate their own life for no reason.\n\nTL;DR: The disjointedness is a feature, not a bug. It’s not AI, it’s just ADHD and a really stupid project.\n\n  \n~~-chatgpt~~",

Otherwise I wouldn't have nearly as much as I do. This is all what I'm currently running. I have a custom server that I built years ago that's not running at the moment because I have no use for it. It's got about 45TB of space on it. I'll find a use for it in the future I'm sure but for now it's just off and not using power.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is WAY overkill I'm sure. I started off with just an old PC with a couple 3TB hard drives and it expanded from there. This was about a decade of slowly saving and building up from there. If you're unsure of what you should get, just start out small and simple. Then make small additions or upgrades here and there. Don't feel the need to go all out right away.",

I did this mostly for Frigate, which I’m running in HA.  This has been a lot of fun, as I’ve now got various automations running based on face and object recognition from my cameras. \n\nThe other I’m moving to an N5 Pro with 5x 22TB drives and 96gb RAM (I was able to get everything before the most recent price spikes).   I played around with switching OSes, tried both TrueNAS and Unraid for a bit, but ultimately I’m sticking with OMV.  So far all I’ve moved over is my media stack, Plex and arr stuff.  I’ll be moving document and backup services over to it soon.  Then the big next step and reason for that hardware will be to play with some local LLMs.  \n\nI’m also switching ISPs and will soon have 8gb fiber which is going to kick ass, but even better than the bandwidth is I’ll finally have full control over the router vs my current ISPs super locked down BS.  So once that’s in place I’ll be setting up AdGuard or Pihole which I haven’t had in a decade.  From there I’m looking forward to exploring a bunch of other network stuff that will be new to me. \n\nHopefully I’ll be all done in Jan and I’ll probably write up a complete overview.",

I also have a Synology DS414, which was my old NAS, before building the server, now it's backup to UnRAID - as it's so old it only supports up to 4TB drives. My UnRAID server has 4x 6TB drives for NAS duty, and 2x NVME drives for docker containers/caching. My Unifi network is ran entirely off my Unifi Cloud Gateway Max, which is disconnected from Unifi's cloud to keep everything local, I have that device, along with 1 5-port 2.5GbE switch, 1x 8-port PoE 1GB switch (for Reolink PoE security cameras), 1 Unifi U6LR on the back porch for outside coverage (my house basically has no cell coverage where I live on any US carrier), 1 Unifi U7 Pro inside the house for WiFi. I have a Pi Rack of a Raspberry Pi 5 8GB, Raspberry Pi 4, Pi 2 and Banana Pi, the Pi 2 and Banana Pi aren't doing much of anything at the moment, and the Pi 4 I have to re-configure since moving to the Pi 5, or find another use for it.\n\nThe only things I want to add are Lidarr for some music, immich for all my SLR photos (I do photography as a hobby on the side - shoot on Canon mirrorless), and I need to figure out a good NVR solution for my Reolink cameras. I tried shinobi and frigate and couldn't get them working properly, but that could have just been me lol. I'm open to suggestions for a good NVR I can run on UnRAID - since that's my storage anyway.\n\nOh and I have Wireguard running on the Unifi Cloud Gateway for remote access, as well as OpenVPN on the Synology (how I VPN'ed in prior to getting the Unifi CGM last month)",

          "text": "Happy new year!  This year was mainly one of learning in the self-hosted space for me, I had a couple month break while I was job searching where I really honed in a lot on learning what I could to keep my skills sharp.\n\nBefore this year, I was mostly living in the realm of debian VMs running Proxmox, that I would deploy docker compose files to.  I really wanted to learn kubernetes, so I initially started out with setting up k3s, and I eventually got my normal \\*arr + jellyfin, forgejo, and vaultwarden stack up, with support from Traefik as a reverse proxy, Cert Manager, Longhorn for storage, etc\n\nThen I heard of NixOS, and the idea of a purely declarative environment was really appealing to me.  I went with hosting my services baremetal for a little bit, and that led to learning a lot about Linux networking through configuring systemd-networkd...and I even got a cheap mini PC with dual 10G ethernet ports and setup a custom router with nftables for firewall, kea DHCP, and blocky for ad-blocking DNS.\n\nI also got a Framework Desktop with the AMD Strix Halo platform, and I had a decent time experimenting with local LLMs using ollama's ROCm support.\n\nBut then I decided I wanted to go back to the world of containers.  So I've reinstalled Proxmox on my servers, got them in a cluster with ceph, and I've got a set of Terraform modules that spin up and configure an HA cluster with Talos.\n\nThis time I really wanted to dive further into k8s stuff, so I'm doing the whole works:\n\n* cilium CNI with Gateway API support (still using CertManager with a letsencrypt DNS-01 challenge for now)\n* rook-ceph CSI (connecting to the ceph setup in proxmox)\n* CloudNativePG for replicated database\n* one of ArgoCD / Flux for Gitops\n* SSO with Authentik (which I had setup briefly in my original incarnation of the k8s stuff in k3s, but didn't get to explore the full potential of)\n\nSo far, Talos' documentation is excellent, and there are some things I didn't quite figure out in bare-metal k3s land in NixOS that I already have a better idea of for when I get to them (hardware accelerated transcoding in Jellyfin being a big one)\n\nOf course the plan is still to host my normal services, but I still have a little bit to go on the infrastructure side before I'll be ready for that.  First will be Forgejo and Gitops, then Vaultwarden restored from my backup, then the media stack, then install Talos bare-metal on the Framework Desktop.  \n  \nThere are some services I've had my eye on that I wanted to hold off on implementing until I was more comfortable with my infrastructure.  Forefront of my mind for these would be:  \n\n* Paperless-NGX for document uploads (especially potentially leveraging full-text search with some LLMs maybe)\n* Immich for photos\n* Likely tailscale for outside of network access\n\nI also have a couple smaller apps I'll be writing up that I intend to host, things like custom Discord bots and such.\n\nI've also had HomeAssistant running on a raspberry pi for a little bit, but I haven't explored the possibilities with that as much as I'd like\n\n  \nHardware is two beefy custom built servers in Fractal Design tower cases with too many hard drive slots, a minisforum ms-01 (mostly as the lighter weight 3rd node for HA stuff like proxmox cluster, ceph, cnpg, etc), the Framework Desktop.  I also have an old system76 meerkat I'll probably use as a single proxmox node to host a development cluster where I can try things out",

          "text": "\nHere is my 2025 stack. Honestly, I try to keep it as simple as possible, though \"*simple*\" is relative!\n\n* **Komodo** – **Infrastructure management.** After 4 years of Portainer, I migrated because I was losing track of the source of truth for my stacks. With Komodo's two-way git sync, my Git repo is *always* the source of truth, no matter where I change the config. I run the Core in Docker, but the Periphery agents run on systemd, automated with Ansible and GitHub Actions so they update themselves regularly.\n\n\n* **Keerakeep & Linkwarden** – **Bookmark managers.** I find myself swapping often between these two.\n\n\n* **Passbolt & Vaultwarden** – **Password managers.** I run them both as copies of each other, as each has distinct pros and cons. I cannot pick one yet, so I'll see what kind of features they release next year.\n\n\n* **AdGuard Home & Tailscale** – **Network & Privacy.** I don't use commercial VPNs, but this combo helps significantly fight browser fingerprinting. I mainly use DoH in round-robin, and I like the results I get while browsing the web.\n\n\n* **Traefik, Caddy & Pangolin** – **Reverse proxy and load balancing.** I use each of them differently, but usually, Traefik sits in front of Caddy.\n\n\n* **CrowdSec** – **Security and threat detection.** I sometimes write custom collections to limit API usage on specific apps. I’ve hooked CrowdSec into a self-hosted **VictoriaMetrics** instance and use **Grafana** to build threat detection dashboards that track all attacks and decisions. Since the community version of CrowdSec does not keep retention, this setup allows me to keep 2 years of decision history.\n\n\n* **Teable** – **Postgres frontend / Airtable alternative.** This is my main backend data storage and smart spreadsheet (moved here after 2 years on Baserow). I use it for books, movies, Oura habit tracking, and my LLM knowledge base.\n\n\n* **Metabase** – **Intelligence system.** Hooked directly into Teable to build dashboards on the data I'm collecting.\n\n\n* **n8n & Activepieces** – **Automation.** I use n8n with custom built Python modules for machine learning, feeding them data from Teable to make predictions.\n\n\n* **Actual Budget** – **Budget tracking.** The data is hooked into Teable and N8N for analysis.\n\n\n* **Restic** – **Backups.** I perform offsite backups to S3, dumping all Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB databases daily. Everything is encrypted. I keep 12 months of full backups and 7 days of incremental backups.\n\n\n* **Ghost CMS** – **Self-publishing.** I use a dual-CDN setup. Mainly I'm with Cloudflare, but it automatically switches to BunnyCDN if Cloudflare goes down (which seems to happen much more often lately).\n\n\n* **Element** – **Chat.** Self-hosted chat based on the Matrix protocol. I don't like the Chat Control initiative, so I'm ready to switch once the law is passed.\n\n\n* **SearXNG** – **Meta-search engine.** I have this configured as the default search engine in all my browsers.\n\n\n* **NTFY & Telegram** – **Notifications.** Sometimes I push notifications to my self-hosted NTFY, but other times I use AI agents to publish them directly to Telegram.\n\n---\n\n### Things to add in the future\n\n* **Immich or Photoprism:** For my pictures. They are going to hold my camera shots only (mainly my Fuji files and collections).\n\n\n* **Book Management:** I need a decent app to migrate my non-fiction books from Apple Books (epub format). I have tons of books but no idea where to hook them up. I tried Calibre but didn't like it. Open to suggestions.\n\n\n* **Encrypted File Storage:** A decent self-hosted app for file storage to replace my Proton Drive (approx 10GB library). Open to suggestions. Precedes the simplicity and security. NO nextcloud or similar.  Must use encryption at rest and file sharing, easy upload from a mobile device. \n\n\nP.S. Let me know if you have  good suggestions for the file storage or book apps.",

I'm a long ago high end IT support dude (Venture capital firms... essentially tech support for billionaires), so some of this stuff kind of made sense. \n\nI'll likely write up a decent build guide though....\n\nThe light version/story:\n\nI started by being annoyed that WD or any other company, ever produced a updated version of the amazing WD My Passport Wireless Pro, which is an amazing bit of media serving tech. 2tb HDD, two wifi adapters, 6+ hour battery, Plex server (direct play only), 1.4 lbs. \n\nMine still works, but it's 8 year old tech and just matter of time before it craps out. \n\nWhen I saw there was a case for $50 that would hold a Pi4 and 2.5\"HDD. I threw together essentially what I'd want a Passport replacement to have and had ai both evaluate it's feasibility and cost. And the result was a pretty amazing bit of possible kit, at around $180. \n\nAnd building the thing, physically and software stack looked kind of fun and manageable; with ai doing the heavy lifting in Linux. \n\nThe hardest SW bit by far, was automating the transcode of any existing and future media in my master library, that the PI can't direct play with Kodi, when connected to a TV via HDMI. That was all built and runs on my NAS, the result is 80% of my collection being already compatible and 20% being transcodes. All that is synced to the PI. \n\nThe other challenge was cutting the case bottom exactly right so I could fit/slide in the 15mm high 5tb drive, while still leaving the various screws and fasteners in place for the case to hold everything. The accuracy of cutting aluminum with an oscillating multi-tool, saved my ass there. With the tool, the cutting wasn't too hard. \n\nSorting out how powerbanks output reliable 5v 2amp power took awhile; as everything is hyped around Watts and etc. Turns out all of that stuff was irrelevant. What matters is: does it have a usb-a charging outlet, is it a reputable brand so you can believe their mah numbers and their claim it does passthrough. UGREEN seems to be the sweet spot. \n\nFinally, the awkward shape of the battery meant the thing would wobble and likely tip over all the time. So I used the existing screw holes on the bottom of the case with 30mm & 40mm standoff screws bolted to a sheet of aluminum the same size as the case to hold the battery under the thing. I got lucky that the battery fit to the exact mm, with no margin of error. F' me, whew. \n\nThe thing is just rad. To look at, hold and use. It's such a useful piece of kit.",

Hyper backup copies all docker containers and data across the network to the second nas located in a separate building, as well as uploading it to the cloud once a day.\n\nYes, Synology container manager to install Portainer, then Portainer to manage all containers from there. It is a much better interface for your containers. You can still see and modify them in container manager in the DSM if need be.\n\nThe Beelink is for Plex.  While I aim for zero transcoding of content some users have hardware that requires it. The NAS is already busy running all the containers and managing / storing all the data. Having a powerful mini computer for Plex ensures smooth transcodes and less strain on the NAS. I sometimes have 8 - 10 simultaneous streams, with 3 or 4 being transcoded. No sweat for the Beelink, but that would bing the NAS to its knees.\n\nThe Beelink is a headless Ubuntu server. It too is running everything in docker containers managed by Portainer.\n\nAs for container distribution, most everything runs on the main NAS. To balance processor power and memory usage some containers run on the other two servers. My Azuracast radio stations are served from the Backup NAS saving the main system's processor power for other tasks. Plex got its own system.",

Seriously. So, I decided to build my own \"local internet.\" Big **Hypnospace Outlaw** vibes here. It’s not just for aesthetics; I needed a way to browse my media, read RSS feeds (via the Outlook Express UI), and access cached content without waiting for buffering.\n2. **The \"Vibe Coding\" Part:** I picked the flair for a reason. I'm a **System Engineer**, not a Frontend Developer. Coding isn't my main job. Yes, I used AI tools to bridge the gap. But this wasn't a magic \"one-shot prompt.\" I had to architect the backend, figure out the file system logic, and spend hours debugging spaghetti code. It was a grind.\n3. **Is it real?:** 100%. The screenshots aren't AI art. It connects to my real services (Navidrome, etc.) and actually works as my daily driver.\n4. **Source Code:** Right now, the code lives in my local Gitea. To be honest, it's a mess. I need to do some serious cleaning before I'm brave enough to push it to GitHub.\n\n*P.S. English isn't my first language, so bear with me.*",

What motivated you for adding this feature?\n\n\nThanks",

However, if I'm at home/on LAN it seems that LMS (lyrion music server) is the best solution... It just has tons of functionality and it works on the 3 prong player-controller-server model, which makes the most sense at home: it works excellent for sychronized playing across multiple speakers/devices.\n\nI don't think I ever tried Tempus.. I was using symfonium as navidrome frontend, but my phone's broken now. Gunna have to check out tempus when i can",

Running most of the same stuff, though I'm on Unraid. \n\nI just bought a home, and am getting ready to deploy cameras and a local AI server to act as my HA voice assistant. I am also degoogling myself as best I can for the coming SaaS/Subscriptionpocolypse. I have about 20 remote Plex users, and am also putting up a couple small business websites. I'm planning on moving the Unraid media server to a collocation site to get cooling, power and speed taken care of. \n\nBut your infrastructure looks much more purposefully-built than mine is. Can you give me a play by play of how and why you laid things out like you did?  I'm not a sysadmin with any training, so this is a learning experience for me. I've just been learning as I go and spending money when it seemed right to do so.\n\nI noticed you're using both Suricata and ZenArmor. Can you talk a bit how they're set up and what they're doing for you? I only know what a quick web search says, but you might have a specific take more applicable to my setup.\n\nAre you collocating your server off site? If so, how's the performance when running HomeAssistant over distance? Are there any latency issues? I saw the Coral TPU and Frigate, which I plan on running as well.  Along with Whisper and Piper.  My plan is to collocate the Unraid server and then have a secondary AI server running at home with the cameras and detection software and integrating it all into HA.\n\nDo you plan on continuing with Google SSO in the future? Any security concerns about that?\n\nYou're running several dockers that I don't personally run, which is leading me to start doing some research on them. You've definitely got me curious. I really appreciate you putting up your chart.",

I haven’t noticed any latency issues when accessing services over VPN, including Home Assistant. That said, the hosting site is only about 10 miles from my house, has very redundant high-speed connectivity, and I have FTTP at home, so that definitely helps.\n\nFor cameras and Al, from what I’ve seen recently Google Coral is no longer the recommended option. the Hailo-8 accelerator seems to be preferred.\n\nOn the security side, Suricata is running in IPS mode and focuses on filtering WAN traffic. ZenArmor runs on internal subnets and is used for outbound traffic filtering that's why they laid out on 2 sides of FW.\n\nfor  Google SSO I haven’t seen any security issues with it. I get notifications whenever someone attempts to create an account, the account would be created, but it has absolutely no permissions by default. I also get notification and can act instantly, it's very convenient for not tech users that use my infrastructure.",

Owntracks has the advantage that it tries to send the data directly to the server. That is really helpful if you want to use the live map feature. But you need a constant connection to your lab. It saves the points also when there is no connection and then sends them when you are back. Sometimes this misses some data, did not find out why. \n\nGPSLogger seems to be working better in handling moments where I am not able to connect to the lab. This handled a 3 weeks visit to Spain just fine and then uploaded everything when I was back. The problem here is that it crashes sometimes and stops tracking you location. \n\nFor ios I liked Overland the most but besides some testing had not any real life experiences with that. \n\nI do not have it exposed since I have no need to update my location in realtime right now.

Quick privacy tip: since you're pulling metadata from Spotify's API, you might want to document what data gets embedded in the final files. Some users get paranoid about tracking data in their self-hosted libraries (rightfully so). The beets integration is smart - keeps everything consistent. Have you tested how it handles albums that exist on YouTube Music but not Spotify? That edge case might trip up the metadata matching.",

I’m using since the beginning of the project. \n\n\\- \\[dpaste\\](https://github.com/DarrenOfficial/dpaste) - Why this not very know solution instead of the classic “pastebin” ones? Simple: this has the ability to returns urls with only 4 or 5 characters after the slash (example: dpaste.example.com/aBcDe). This is great because when I need to share something between devices, it’s very easy to remember the link. If I had the possibility of share a very long url, only because it’s very long, I would send the content of the paste instead the paste link. \n\n\\- \\[Forgejo\\](https://forgejo.org) (and their runners)- Great git server forked from Gitea with something extraordinary: the paths and the workflows syntax are the same as GitHub. Very easy to learn, maintain and improve. \n\nAnd of course nginx Proxy Manager and PiHole. \n\nWhat are yours “essentials”?",

      "text": "Hello folks, it's been a month since I last posted about an update. This update for BentoPDF is the biggest so far and introduces a lot of features.\n\nBut before that I wanted to share BentoPDF wrapped, which shows what tools and what type of PDFs you guys mostly used this year ❤️:  [BentoPDF Wrapped](https://www.bentopdf.com/wrapped.html) \n\n**New Releases**\n\n**1. Revamped Compression tool**\n\nBentoPDF now has the best compression among all open source tools.\n\nBentoPDF had two compression algos: Vector and Photon. Vector has been deprecated and replaced with Condense, which is now the recommended method.\n\nI tested it across various type of PDFs with different languages, and it performs either almost on par and sometimes better than commercial ones.\n\n**2. Office to PDF and PDF to Office Support**  \n  \nNow supports converting **Word, PowerPoint, Excel, CSV** documents to PDF.  \n  \nAdded support for OpenOffice formats: **ODT, ODS, ODP, and ODG**  \n  \nAlso supports for: **PDF to Word, PDF to Excel and PDF to CSV**\n\n**3. Now supports a variety of image formats**\n\nJPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, PNM, PGM, PBM, PPM, PAM, JXR, JPX, JP2 (JPEG 2000) PSD, SVG, HEIC, and WebP can now be converted to PDF\n\nAlso supports PDF to SVG\n\n**4. Markdown Support**\n\n  \nA new markdown live preview has been added, which supports both GFM and Common Mark. Mermaid support was also supposed to be in this release, but I stashed the changes and forgot to include them lol. But it will be included in next release.  \n\n\nPDF to Markdown is also supported with embedded image\n\n  \n5. **E-book & Comic Book Formats**  \n  \nAdded support for converting **EPUB, MOBI, CBR, CBZ, FB2, and XPS** files to PDF.\n\n  \n**6. Data Extraction & AI Ready**  \n  \n**Prepare for AI**: Output LLM-ready JSON from your PDF for easy ingestion by AI models.  \n  \n**Extract Tables**: Extract tables from PDF and export them as JSON, Markdown, or CSV.  \n  \n**PDF to Text**: This performs fast text extraction for digital PDFs. FOr non digital OCR tool is recommended.  \n  \n**Extract Images**: Extracts all images while retaining their original native format and resolution.\n\n**7. PDF/A SUpport**  \nSupports PDF/A-1b,2b,3b. Please verify with verapdf always.\n\n  \nMiscellaneous Tools\n\n\\---\n\nText to PDF now has proper support for RTL languages\n\nWe also added Booklet support\n\nRasteize PDF is now supported\n\nNested OCG support is included\n\n  \nThank you again for your support! In the next release Digital Signature and true text editing will be possible.\n\nFull Release Note: [https://github.com/alam00000/bentopdf/releases/tag/v1.15.1](https://github.com/alam00000/bentopdf/releases/tag/v1.15.1)",

I hope you get what I mean. This has been going on since inception and it’s pretty bad to look at if I may, although it’s just an aesthetic thing.

I've never used HomeBox, but I have NiimBot D110, so I might try this out. \n\nReading through everything, I'm wondering if there's a way to avoid having to copy the file around. Since you say the Niimbot integration needs a URL, maybe it's possible to supply it directly the image URL from HomeBox. I realize that there is the issue of authentication, but maybe HomeBox has a way to disable it for certain paths or to accept a header... Just a thought.",

I took advantage of inotify to watch the labels directory, then used MQTT to publish the image to my HA server.  ~~I use NodeRed to then save the image from MQTT to a directory that then gets moved to a folder in my HA directory (NOT www as that's not secure), and then created a local camera entity.~~  EDIT: See below.  Automation uses the camera entity path/api to create the label.\n\nReason for the workaround being I didn't want to deal with network mounts/shares.  Not sure my way is \"better\" but it felt a bit cleaner to me.\n\nEdit: Had a further inspiration to streamline things, now just using an MQTT camera entity so no more need for the second script to copy things around on the second server.\n\nEdit 2: Blog post: [https://blog.fuzzymistborn.com/homebox-labels-over-mqtt/](https://blog.fuzzymistborn.com/homebox-labels-over-mqtt/)",

First of all, termix is a gateway, meaning that if you use the desktop / mobile app, your connections won't go straight to the server but instead over your hosted termix gateway instance. XPipe is purely client-based, meaning that it connects straight the servers from your desktop. The gateway approach has limitations, e.g. you can't just use any hardware security keys for SSH with it or communicate with your local password manager. With XPipe, that is possible.\n\nSecond, termix kinda goes for an all-in-one approach (it kind of has to), meaning that terminals, editor, file browser, SSH library, etc. is all built into termix via some javascript libraries. XPipe instead goes for integrations with external tools, meaning that you can use your own terminal, editor, etc. with it as it does not implement it on its own. This workflow allows you to keep using all the tools you know and like.\n\nTermix has the goal of replacing Termius as a solution that you can use from everywhere while XPipe has a strict focus on the desktop and a more broader focus on integrations aside from SSH. Many of those integrations are only possible due to the desktop-based approach",

Just create some sort of access (tailscale, vpn, etc) to the gateway server, which should allow you to have access to all the different machines on the remote network you've already set up?\n\nI will have to try to both to see the differences.

An example is if you don't configure payments, they won't work and all users will be under the \"Pro\" plan automatically, and that section won't even appear in the webapp.\n\nAI is an exceedingly good semantic searching system, so since I built the project slowly over the week this was an easier way to figure out which environment variables became necessary and which are not. The result it came up with was *fine.*",

Yes, there are some bugs, but it's mostly minor things and not that it is unusable because of those bugs.\n\nInstallation-wise, it's literally just a PHP app with a database (and maybe redis). No special sauce required at all. You can just spin up a php container with the required modules installed, slap nginx in front of it, add the database and be done with it. Disable all the bloated collaborative working apps and it's just a dropbox-like experience.",

In the end I found a script that would just run and install it all for me but I got in a huge mess and most of Nextcloud was broken.\n\nEventually I just paid someone on fiverr to help me out and he did a great job of it. I've learnt a lot since then but even now I look through the config files for nginx and nextcloud he created and still don't understand half of it.\n\nYou say just 'spin up a PHP container' and 'slap nginx in front of it'. Both of those are pretty difficult to do if you've never done it before. But if you have any recommended resources, please share them and we can learn!",

It makes deployment straightforward and, somewhat surprisingly, uses very little in the way of system resources.\nAs an example, my users have uploaded around 3 TB of data over the past three years. The data is backed up daily and stored on mechanical drives, yet performance has been effortless and reliable. One key factor, in my experience, is running the Nextcloud application itself on an SSD.

I use the Synology reverse proxy to access the containers on my server remotely, and it works great. So I understand the challenges of self hosting, including Nextcloud, and for what you’re trying to do, Synology may be the better solution.

However, there was a minor thing a while back, couldn't tell you what it was, but it took me for-goddamn-ever to figure out how to get back into the back-end of the AIO. Along with wanting to consolidate and make the environment smaller, I started looking at OCIS and opencloud. Both are also stupid to set up if you have an existing proxy configuration. They also dont have any sort of built in MFA out of the box. That was a deal breaker for me on both. Everyone speaks so well of syncthing, so I gave it another try. And damn it is impressive. Just set it up as a container on my truenas box, and it's all right there. I was hopeful for a few things with nextcloud that it could never really provide...and the fact you couldnt import a CSV for contacts?! What the hell?!",

Funny one of my friends is still using one of the older versions with manual installation, quite robust so to say. Community edition, never failed btw! \n\nThen I moved to NextCloud with a belief that it is going to perform better, may have better features or whatever. docker-based setup with TLS + S3 as the storage. In general, worked fine. But then I wanted to expand and run the Office tools and that automatically would've increased the cost of the EC2 instance. Went with bare-metal server instead and after various hoops with AIO appliance I've dropped the ball - self-signed certificate is pure pain and some other issues. \n\nSo you know what? This year I went back to Seafile myself. Setup == Seafile + OnlyOffice + Cloudflare Proxy(not the reverse tunnel!), all docker. Works perfectly, never gave me any headache, handles stuff. Works faster, their filesystem might be something to be afraid of, but proper daily backups should save you from having whoopsies.",

I tried for several days, hit a handful of dead ends, then started over (because someone on this sub said \"it didn't work for me the first time, then I started over and it worked\"), and well, it did work. I wasn't keen on exposing it on a domain at first, but I already had a domain sitting there, so I used a third-level from it and now I can access my calendar from anywhere. \n\nAdmittedly, I use it for several \"lighter\" features it has: it has replaced Google Calendar, it is synching my phone's address book, and I only share a limited set of files on it - even though some extensions, from GPXPod to Cookbook, have opened up use cases I hadn't been expecting for NextCloud in particular. For instance I never thought I'd end up using a password manager, but now that I can host one myself I'm seriously considering it. \n\nWas it easy? No way! The AIO installer lets you put it in the network you have with the services you have and doesn't expect to enforce any convention or any tool on you - the flip side is that you have to do all that stuff by yourself and it's not always clear how you couple yours with theirs. I can handle setting up Docker containers, configuring a DNS server, the router of the ISP modem, I can set up a reverse proxy with Nginx, I'm a pro and I'm passionate about it - yet it wasn't exactly easy as I expected an AIO installation to be. I totally agree that this setup is not for the casual hobbyist. \n\nCould it be easier than this? Maybe reducing the versatility could help in streamlining the process. Maybe removing some features that require additional setup steps would help too. I agree that the problem NC solves is definitely complex and requires more work, but there's definitely room for improvement. As usual, it's a trade-off, and sometimes it's not trivial to realise what the two opposites of it are.",

      "text": "In a couple of months, Karakeep will be two years old. 2025 has been a wild year, so that's a quick lookback about what happened in 2025, and while you're here, I can tell you about the 0.30 release.\n\n*EDIT: For those who don't know what* [*karakeep*](https://karakeep.app/) *is, it's a bookmark manager that's designed for easy sharing and fast retrieval with opt-in AI tagging and summarization.*\n\nLet's start by some stats:\n\n* Karakeep started the year with \\~10k stars on Github, we're now at 22k stars!\n* We had 8 major releases in 2025 starting from 0.21 (the 10k stars release), and ending with 0.29. We had 819 commits in 2025.\n* I have no idea how many active installations there are for karakeep, but apple and google give me some stats about the mobile apps usage, and we're at \\~7.5k monthly active users (MAU) on the mobile apps. On the extensions side, google suggests that we have 29k weekly active users (wth!) and firefox says we have 2.5k daily active users.\n* We're ending the year with 159 contributors on Github (can't be thankful enough) and \\~800 members in our discord server.\n* 1 name change, £8k in lawyer fees and a successful trademark registration.\n\nThe year had a crazy start, we had our moment of fame on the frontpage of hackernews, followed by the now-infamous hoarder saga. After a couple of months of trademark nonsense, we ended up changing the app's name to Karakeep. Back then, I was afraid that the name change would kill the momentum, but I was wrong and Karakeep ended up more famous than Hoarder ever was. As of two days ago, we're now the proud owners of the \"Karakeep\" trademark to hopefully deter future trolls.\n\nAnother big event this year, was the launch of Karakeep cloud. Trying to fill the gap that pocket left, share the product with non-techies, and go through the full productionization journey of the product which was quite interesting.\n\nKarakeep was born out of this subreddit, got popular because of it, and it's what's keeping me going. (confession: I read every mention of karakeep in this sub). It honestly warms my heart every time I see karakeep being recommended here. Thank you, happy new year and looking forward to a strong 2026!\n\nWhile you're here, I've just released [v0.30](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep/releases/tag/v0.30.0), which includes:\n\n* Karakeep wrapped 2025 (a bit late).\n* PDF archives\n* Better metadata extraction for reddit, youtube and amazon. Reddit in particular used to be a common pain point which is hopefully now addressed.\n* Reader settings that are synced across all devices to better improve the read-it-later part of karakeep.\n* Customization of AI settings per user (toggling it on/off, changing the language and also the tagging style).\n* [Our docs](https://docs.karakeep.app/) got a big revamp in terms of styling, organization and also some new content. We now have a \"Using karakeep\" section that talks about the different concepts of karakeep.\n* The mobile app also got a bunch of UI/UX improvements.\n* And a lot more mentioned in the [release notes](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep/releases/tag/v0.30.0).\n\nFinally, I'm collecting testimonials for karakeep to put them on the homepage. If you’ve been using it and feel like sharing a few words, I’d appreciate it.",

The major release comes with a few breaking changes that might affect you, so please check out the [upgrade guide](https://pocket-id.org/docs/setup/major-releases/migrate-v2) before upgrading.\n\nThis release comes with a few new features, but in the spotlight are the two most requested features:\n\n\\- [SCIM Provisioning](https://pocket-id.org/docs/configuration/scim): The SCIM integration allows you to provision and de-provision users automatically. Unfortunately it's not supported by many services at the moment but I hope there will be more services that will support it in the future.\n\n\\- [Data Export and Import](https://pocket-id.org/docs/setup/data-export-import): Two new CLI commands have been added to import and export your Pocket ID data.  This is useful when creating backups, moving an installation to another instance or switching database providers.\n\n  \nYou can read the full release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/pocket-id/pocket-id/releases/tag/v2.0.0).\n\n  \nWe hope that you are enjoying Pocket ID :) As always, if you think there is a feature missing feel free to propose it on [GitHub](https://github.com/pocket-id/pocket-id/issues) or give your vote with a thumbs up (👍) on existing feature requests.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2b1wyb7vmzag1.png?width=3029&format=png&auto=webp&s=67bbc663c5eb92fd4133233ab0e1050796ab39fa\n\n",

There are dozens of reverse proxies available, and most of them support OIDC authentication out of the box or with a plugin. I mean probably everyone of you already use a reverse proxy, isn't it cleaner and more reliable to integrate Pocket ID into your reverse proxy of choice instead of using Pocket ID as a reverse proxy?",

Maybe I am using Cloudflare zero trust like you are using oauth2-proxy or tinyauth.\n\n\nWhat is your set up like, and how would Pocket ID having proxy support simplify it?",

      "text": "I signed up for their service and chose a ‘Full Year Commitment’ after hearing about them. To my despair, this was my worst decision. Although I had opted for their cheapest service, as soon as I tried connecting to something as basic as GITHUB, I got to know that I cannot do it cz I’ve been assigned a blacklisted IP. I develop for open source and cannot afford really expensive servers for all my use cases. This server was supposed to be for a cloud reverse proxy into my homelab!\n\nOn opening the incident # CS14530016 support told me to run a bunch of unneeded commands (wasting a day or two) only to later confirm that indeed my IP was blacklisted.\n\nUpon requesting them to well.. rotate it as any sane person would do, I got responded with the following response:\n\nWe regret to inform you that we cannot change the primary IP address of the server, since the primary IP is under blacklist we cannot change or replace it. If you want a different IP you will need to purchase a new server however we cannot guarantee a clean IP as our IPv4's are recycled as there is currently a shortage of IPv4's, all IPv4's are recycled from most service providers therefore there are times certain IP(s) would be placed in a block-list. We are unable to de-list IP(s) if they are in a block-list we do not support and IP(s) are unable to be replaced especially if it's the main IP of the server.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nLike really? Apart from their atrocious UI, is this somehow become an expected practice and / or outcome? I understand that their servers are cheap and clearly would’ve attracted abusers in the past but why am I, a paying customer penalised for it? Curious to know what you guys think on if expecting a clean IP is now a luxury which warrants additional premium?\n\nLooking for guidance from the community on their experience over this scenario and other alternatives.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nEDIT: This server is blacklisted under UCEPROTECTL3.\n\nIt’s a brand new server bought two weeks ago. Since then I’ve been in letter exchange with support. GitHub is only one such affected host.\n\nEDIT2: Some of you have suggested that being on the blacklist may not be the cause for my issues. Doing a traceroute although shows that the requests stop ‘hopping’ or ‘routing’ any further post reaching a Microsoft owned IP. curl resolves the IP but timeout and fails to perform the TLS Handshake. Also, it is possible that their support is delusional because what they said was the following:\n\n*I can see that your server IP {redacted} is blacklisted under UCEPROTECTL3 which is likely causing the issue. As OVH does not manage UCEPROTECT we will unfortunately not be able to delist the IP immediately and also we don't have the ETA.*\n\nAnd after verifying that indeed my IP is blacklisted therein, I just assumed that that’s the cause. Could there be something else cooking? Even Cloudflare doesn’t work. And, it’s not a general issue with HTTPS.\n\n—\n\ncurl -v   [ https://1.1.1.1 ](https://1.1.1.1)\n\n\\*   Trying 1.1.1.1:443...\n\n\\* connect to 1.1.1.1 port 443 from {redacted} port 35724 failed: Connection timed out\n\n\\* Failed to connect to 1.1.1.1 port 443 after 135972 ms: Could not connect to server\n\n\\* closing connection #0\n\ncurl: (28) Failed to connect to 1.1.1.1 port 443 after 135972 ms: Could not connect to server\n\nPlease note that a curl to Google on 443 works just fine and I’m able to receive the HTML payload back just fine.",

It's not that hard. You submit a delisting request (together with proof of resolution if required) to the blacklist providers on whose lists your IP is (there are tools to check that) and that'll get the IP off the lists. Hosting providers regularly do that and for most of them, it's an automated process these days. Most of them also inform their customers if an IP of theirs was reported as abusive and require them to fix potential issues.\n\nIf that wasn't the issue and if it was indeed just GitHub being weird, you'd of course be correct.",

I was then just told to purchase an additional v4, and since I'm in a commitment until November this year I've just setup netplan to not use the address.\n\n\nIt would be very nice if they were more helpful but you get what you get unfortunately.",

FPS multiplayer games which are the subscription / micro transaction cash cows of the industry just don't work well (network latency vs frame latency) especially not with all the high refresh +240hz screens coming out.\n\nA heavily optimized AAA game is *at least* ~60GB, probably more. Which means at least from the gaming context some form of local storage is going to be necessary, even if it isn't up in the double digit Terabyte range.\n\nFurthermore the main buyers of AI are big tech / cloud providers.\n\nThe energy costs of running said AI are not low, which means they'll try to cross-subsidize with other products in their stack. That will namely be \"serverless\" architecture and storage (Azure, AWS, GCP).\n\nSome of those offers are already pretty terrible with regards to ingress / egress fees, so increasing the price is only going to make it worse, which will justify some SMB's moving to self-hosting to reduce costs.\n\nAnd as long as SMB's have a need / can buy storage in bulk from manufacturers, consumers too will have a way to acquire them. Even if it is slightly worse then \"at cost\".\n\nIf true, it means we should experience a \"squeeze\" (on storage supply) as SMB's move out of the cloud, before it relaxes later.\n\nHowever that all assumes AI continues on a growth trajectory. More likely i think it's going to fail spectacularly.\n\nThis is also why prices of RAM are so high in part. The RAM cartel don't want to overinvest in more capacity only for AI to fail and have it just sitting there doing nothing. They'd rather constrain supply.",

Add to  that rising concerns about data sovereignty and protection (US cloud act, debacles with hacks and downtime) and slowly companies are going back in house. \n\nBecause the cloud providers will pay similarily marked up prices for their hardware as a medium scale own premises installation would, the price ratio between the two should stay consistent so I don’t think current trends will reverse. \n\nAlso the private people that need TBs of storage are better served with local just because of the cloud prices. If you’re a data hoarder cloud always was unaffordable. Having a 30tb server is something else than getting 100gb Dropbox cloud storage.  The same things apply here as well. \n\nThe typical user basically needs a 2tb SSD for the os, documents, a few games and maybe local caching of streaming clients. Depending on your use case you can be set for life with 500gb. Cloud storage is not useful for any of these things (if you’re using more cloud storage than there is local one and you rely on as needed download of files, have a long hard think about who really has your data then and if that is a good choice)",

Either some of the existing manufacturer will do something, or new manufacturers will rise to the occasion.\n\nWell, that's what I like to think. From an historical perspective, we've seen many \"huge shift\" that ended up not really changing much of the status quo over time, but these last few years have been… full of surprises.",

That's not following the spec they created in the first place. We have signing keys and all kinds of protection that make this entirely unnecessary. It's existing IPs that get exploited (i.e. Salesforce now requires users to verify themselves before sending a single email). \n\n*Why are we letting these companies break and control the internet? Isn't that a sign you need to stop relying on them...?*\n\nSame time, you can spin up a domain and start sending verified emails from services without issue, so I'm not convinced this is not possible. It's difficult to setup, but not hard to lock down, setup DKIM, etc. There are guides, tools, it's not a black box.",

So, User A queues three songs; they have priorities 1, 2, and 3. Then User B logs in and queues two songs; they have priorities 1 and 2.  \nThe actual playing order would be:  \nUser A: Priority 1  \nUser B: Priority 1  \nUser A: Priority 2  \nUser B: Priority 2  \nUser A: Priority 3  \n(the tiebreaker for priority is first come, first served)",

FOSS and all that.\n\nI work as a developer (mostly old codebases on SLA:s) during daytime so it was nice toying around with some (what I think is) modern stuff like Next.js and OpenCode. \n\nAt first I built it for myself but then I thought \"eh\", why not make it public, maybe someone will find it useful. \n\nIt’s a really bland UI, kinda lightweight (\\~70MB memory), but stable to use. Please be kind!\n\nTo comply with the rules: I am the maker of the app, it was built with the help of AI, and I have no gain in you pulling the image and running the container yourself  – except for maybe sleeping a little better at night knowing that it might have helped someone choose a good movie to watch.",

The episode will now not play at all, just giving me a spinning circle.\n\nI go into settings and toggle on \"Offline Mode\". The episode can now play fine without a data connection of any kind.\n\nI try and go back to my home tab to download something else, but now nothing will load at all until i turn off the 'Offline Mode', even with mobile data active.\n\nIt seems a bit counterintuitive to keep having to jump in and out of settings just to watch something that's sitting locally on the device. Can it not just play without having to do that? The 'Offline Mode' seems to be acting like a secondary switch for my mobile data connection, which is odd.",

It's been a couple of intense weeks of work and testing!\n\nWe built qui to be a one-stop-shop for your torrents and their lifecycle, with the main goal that it should work great with huge qBittorrent instances. We have users running single instances with 70k+ torrents working great and others running 35+ instances in a single qui also working great. The multi instance support has been well received by our users!\n\nIt runs everywhere (Linux,MacOS,Windows) on all the common architectures like x86/arm/arm64 as native binaries or containers.\n\nSome of the highlights in this latest version include:\n\n* Automations: powerful workflows and orphan scanning (tqm/qbit\\_manage features)\n* Hardlink and reflink support for cross-seeds\n* ARR integration and other improvements for better cross-seed results\n* Live log streaming (Settings -> Logs)\n\n...and 50+ other improvements.\n\nFull changelog: [https://github.com/autobrr/qui/releases/tag/v1.12.0](https://github.com/autobrr/qui/releases/tag/v1.12.0)\n\nWe also moved to proper docs which you can find at [https://getqui.com](https://getqui.com)\n\nWith some of these new features you can get rid of other external tools and free up resources.",

Especially now with this release where we added hardlink and reflink support and other changes to be more similar to cross-seed.org. If you have an existing setup with the other and are happy with it then you might as well keep using it. If you're starting fresh try the qui cs. It's a lot easier to get started :)\n\nThe arr integration is to fetch metadata ids like imdb/tmdb from the arr and match with your content, and then use that for cross-seed searches which is a lot better than raw title search.",

And this token allows access to all 50+ grpc methods, including all administrative methods such as deleting buckets, deleting users, reading/writing/deleting objects, etc.\n\nThe bad news is that, per my understanding, the gRPC port is always open as it is exposed as part of the \"HTTP + gRPC hybrid service\" of RustFS. So in case your have a port open for HTTP traffic, which would be the standard to use for S3 clients, you also have the gRPC \"port\" opened automatically.\n\nOn top of that, it [looks like ](https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs/issues/1372)the CVE description might be wrong and this vulnerability is indeed already present in `Alpha.13` (of Jul 10, 2025) and not only since `Alpha.77` which means that a lot of RustFS deployments in the wild are vulnerable to this.",

The Copilot summary comment completely misses this as well.\n\nI'm not going to say that this was intentionally swept under the rug in that commit.

I'm glad they did realize it, I'm glad they fixed it, but everything about this is just terrible.\n\nI was looking at using rustfs for a while now, but honestly, I just can't trust it. My gut tells me that it is heavily, heavily written by AI, and without the appropriate level of human review / understanding of what is going on.

I treat it as a Junior Dev who can mess with context and the code quality in general. And of course, I won't commit the code, I don't understand myself because I think I need to be able to maintain all the code manually w/O any AI support in case it's necessary. \n\nThat's why this sub has two distinguished labels: \"vibe-coded\" and \"built with AI\".",

Just go into whatev-arr and add it: when it's out in a year, it's downloaded.\n\n\n\nQuestarr is my take on automated game management with a clean, cover-focused UI.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n🎮 Browse and discover games via IGDB (popular, upcoming, new releases)\n\n📚 Track your collection with status labels (Wanted, Owned, Playing, Completed)\n\n🔍 Search across Torznab indexers (Prowlarr integration supported)\n\n⬇️ Automated downloads via qBittorrent, Transmission, or rTorrent\n\n🎨 Clean dark/light UI optimized for game covers\n\nTech stack: React + TypeScript frontend, Node.js + Express backend, PostgreSQL database. Fully Dockerized for easy deployment.\n\n\n\nSelf-hosted and open source (GPL3). Perfect if you're already running \\*Arr apps and want to extend your stack to games.\n\n\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/Doezer/Questarr](https://github.com/Doezer/Questarr)\n\n\n\nStill early in development and a lot to do still, but functional for basic game library management, downloading torrents from the app, notifications, calendar... At least enough to be made public. Feedback & PRs welcome!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/debikiovb4bg1.png?width=1915&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfd1f9d626c10c0db9529432aa473433d5d54953\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q4tqflewb4bg1.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=de879a5a887bd2edce4723e50ccede5500b7bd0c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fzotc8xwb4bg1.png?width=1643&format=png&auto=webp&s=77b3f8315949b7a09e05f522daf385ecbdde5c73\n\n  \n",

Just sharing what I tried.\nI had an old x86 box lying around, so I wiped it, installed a minimal Linux setup, and ran Android on top of it mostly out of curiosity. The goal wasn’t performance or benchmarks  I just wanted something predictable.\nWhat surprised me is how much of the “smart TV experience” problems are software, not hardware.\nBoot is fast. UI doesn’t stutter over time. No ads. No accounts. No background junk fighting the remote. It turns on and does what it’s supposed to do.\nBefore anyone says it: yes, ARM boxes are cheaper and more power efficient. Yes, DRM is still a limitation. Yes, this isn’t something I’d recommend to non-technical users.\nBut separating the panel from the software changed how I look at TVs. Once the “smart” part stops being tied to vendor firmware, the screen itself suddenly feels like it could last a lot longer.\nCurious if others here have gone the same route x86, ARM, custom Android, Kodi-only setups, whatever or if you’ve just accepted smart TVs as disposable appliances.",

The screen stops aging every time the vendor abandons updates or bloats the OS.\n\nWhat really clicked for me was pairing a “dumb” panel with a **single, predictable source** for everything — one box, one UI, one remote. Whether that’s a minimal Android setup, Kodi-only, or even a lightweight Linux + Android layer like you described, the consistency matters more than raw specs.\n\nThat mindset also carried over to how I handle live TV and streaming. Using a stable service like [**primeiptv.org**](http://primeiptv.org) on a dedicated box instead of relying on built-in smart TV apps has been way more reliable long-term. Fewer updates breaking things, no background nonsense, and the hardware actually feels like it’ll last.\n\nAt this point I see TVs the same way you do: panels should be durable, software should be disposable and under *your* control. Once you flip that mental model, it’s hard to go back",

The hardware rarely dies — the software just rots.\n\nMost people won’t go as far as x86 (DRM + complexity), but the principle scales down nicely:\n\n* TV offline\n* External box you control\n* Replace the box when needed, not the panel\n\nThat’s why even non-technical users eventually land on Android TV boxes or simple setups (some even pair them with IPTV services like [*youriptv.live*](http://youriptv.live) and skip the “smart TV” ecosystem entirely).\n\nSmart TVs aren’t disposable because of hardware — they’re disposable because of software. Your setup proves that pretty clearly.",
