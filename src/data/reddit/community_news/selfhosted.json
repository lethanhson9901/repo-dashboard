I wanted to turn it into a server, but I couldn't enable USB debugging because I couldn't see the screen.\n\n**The Fix:** I used a USB keyboard and blindly typed my PIN, then connected it to Samsung DeX to view the screen and enable USB debugging.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n**OS:** Ubuntu (via Proot-Distro in Termux)  \n**Access:** SSH (automated with Termux:Boot)  \n**Tunnel:** [Playit.gg](http://Playit.gg) (to bypass port forwarding)\n\nIt now sits in my drawer running a MC server for friends.

They have better cameras than almost any webcam and even than most IP cameras. \n\nIts ARM which is getting more and more use outside of small mobile devices, and its essentially a full computer with linux. \n\nLack of IO is the only major downside, but you can still use usb hub to expand it.\n\nI mean, NASA clearly knows this, they used an old samsung phone as part of the helicopter drone they sent to Mars. I dont remember the full list of what it was responsible for though, only that they used its gyros ans accelerometer when the dedicated one failed.",

And i was happy! Upgrading to Ryzen mini-PC brought me way less emotions than getting stuff up on tv box. It's completely silent (literally nothing moves with USB SSD), it eats <10W with a USB 2.5 HDD (or SSD for even less!), and it mostly comes with \"batteries included\" - WiFi, Ethernet, BT, USB 3.0+2.0 out of the box! And it can easily transcode H264\\\\H265 4K with Jellyfin! Ran a whole \\*arr, torrents, Jellyfin, Jackett, etc on that box. \n\nSure , Ryzen mini-PC is way more powerful, has way more RAM and storage, has SATA for additional drive and more USB ports.\n\nBut i still have some warm feelings bound to this box.

Because then you also get into the territory of traffic patterns that would actually result in measurable savings when you \"turn off\" part of your scaling. You obviously can't sell/buy servers as you need them, you need to buy as many as you need in the peak. That's why many opt for cloud. \n\n\nMy company did an interesting experiment where the base load was handled internally and then any peaks were dynamically scaled with AWS.

Seems like a pretty typical pattern, but I know at least 3 teams here struggled with this for a while\n- The limiting factor at some point became the ingress/egress of our internal server farm (or more accurately, the LB in front of it) and scaling that was nontrivial.

Throughput isn’t the impressive part here.  \n\n**What cloud infrastructure buys you isn’t raw capacity, it’s peace of mind**: power and network redundancy, hardware failure, backups, monitoring, not having your company’s infra depend on whether someone trips over a wire ..and the luxury of not having a non-technical family member be the first one to discover your outage.",

Ends up 8 months later with a power outage at someone's home causing company production downtime with no support. \n\nBrilliant for a proof of concept, but no way it should have lasted 8 months on a Pi. Should have moved to an onprem (or AWS) solution. If you got hit by a bus, fired, etc., that'd bring down that part of production with no support, no fall back, and you could be held liable. \n\nCool as shit, though, from a geek perspective. That's awesome as hell! I love that stuff and love all those types of solutions. But, I've learned that the business is pretty strict and legal when it comes to stuff like that and they'll protect the business at all costs. At that point, they DO need AWS for everything. Let them pay for it, let them support it, let them handle the legal aspects of things.",

Are you going to run and support this thing forever for a company that you no longer work for? If you take it down afterwards and get sued for industrial sabotage?\n\n- What is the plan if the power did stay out but it's on at work? And the execs and/or legal find out?\n\n- What is the plan if the SD card corrupts?\n\n- To add to the above, what is the failover plan if the machine were to suddenly take a power spike and go poof in a puff of smoke? Do you have a way to restore it right away so the company doesn't sue you for lost revenue?\n\n- What is the plan if a cybersecurity incident happens and IT finds out that you're running such a critical piece of infrastructure at your home? It's extremely unlikely that their insurance will cover you. Does your insurance support this?\n\n- What is the plan if your ISP finds out that you're running commercial applications on a home connection? Most do not like that one bit. \n\nPlease take that thing away from your home asap. Either install it at work or get it on a VPS provider (if it can run on a PI, it can run on a $5 VPS without issue) and hand over the credentials to your IT department.\n\nedit: I reworded it to be nicer. :P",

For example, the old Picasa program was one that would strip away the MakerNotes when it was told to write changes into the file. The only camera that I can recall that Picasa didn't strip MakerNotes from was Canon.\n\nThis is also one thing that is so frustrating about the galleries on DPReview. So many of their \"straight from the camera\" are edited. A straight from the camera file is not going to mention Adobe in any of its metadata, yet many do.",

I've been using Immich for a while and the metadata parsing can definitely be hit-or-miss with some camera models, so this crowdsourced approach makes a lot of sense. \n\nFor anyone considering participating, definitely heed the warning about taking generic photos. EXIF data can contain way more than you might expect - GPS coordinates, device serial numbers, sometimes even thumbnails of other photos. I'd recommend taking some test shots of random objects, landscapes, or your coffee mug rather than anything identifiable. \n\nYou could also use an older phone or camera if you have one lying around, since they're specifically looking for device variety. The more obscure camera models they get data from, the better the parsing will be for everyone. \n\nThanks for sharing this - hadn't seen it posted anywhere else either.",

Moreover we also have added Podman Quadlet support. Thank you!  \nThe new updated version is: **v1.16.1**\n\nHello everyone!\n\nOver the past \\~10 days, there have been no new updates or fixes pushed to the repository. This pause was unintentional and caused by an ongoing issue with a lost Docker account that we’ve been waiting on Docker to resolve.\n\nUnfortunately, despite multiple follow ups, the only response I’ve received so far is that there is “no update yet.” The prolonged uncertainty has been frustrating and has started to block our release and CI workflows.\n\nTo avoid further delays, I’ve decided to move forward by switching to a new official Docker account starting tomorrow. The previously referenced Docker account should be considered deprecated going forward.\n\nOnce the new account is live, normal development, updates, and releases will resume as usual.\n\nAlso I am very grateful to the community for your patience and support, especially for choosing trust and understanding instead of frustration during this, which would have also been justified given the situation. It truly means a lot and motivates me to keep moving forward.. I will keep this thread updated once everything is setup",

We were basically forced into supporting DockerHub because some NAS devices make it difficult to get containers from any other non-DockerHub source.\n\nWith that said, we basically treat DockerHub like a second class citizen as we only publish the nightly and actual releases, not the branch level super up to date releases due to rate limit issues. The rate limit issues are also why we clone various docker build components needed by the CI/CD process to GHCR.\n\nThere are unfortunately still reasons to publish to DockerHub (even if it is a PITA for us maintainers)",

I have sort of the opposite question – what is literally better when you self-host it, compared to paid cloud alternatives etc?\n\nAnd: WHY is it better to self-host it?\n\nI don't just mean self-hosted services that you enjoy. I mean what FOSS actually contains features or experiences that are missing from mainstream / paid / closed-source alternatives?",

The secondary server runs PBS, also on a VM. The data VM is backed up every few hours to PBS. PBS syncs daily to a cheap Backblaze S3 cloud bucket. Backups are encrypted locally via Proxmox.\n  \nIn practice, the data VM can be quickly restored to any similar-enough machine running Proxmox. If the main server has a problem, I can quickly restore and run it on the secondary server. If both servers fail, I reconfigure a machine to the point of restoring PBS to pull from cloud backups.",

Something that hindered my interest in hosting it previously which was fixed in 1.21.5 (1.21.11 is current) is that plant growth, mob farms, etc operate normally in force loaded chunks (vanilla server feature) regardless of player presence. I think the idea of making the world, it's mechanisms, and its mob interactions persistent and asynchronous to player interaction is something that really makes the game more engaging. No need to AFK to benefit from the industrialization that naturally accompanies progress in the game, for example. Which is also nice as someone with a full time job 😅\n\nI highly recommend people look into self-hosting a drasl server too. You can set it up so you can have an online world that allows or disallows simultaneous offline play, \"3rd party online\" with accounts authenticated through your drasl instance, and/or passthrough to Mojang servers. Not super valuable to me but nice to make my Minecraft purchase robust to arbitrary decisions regarding accounts by Microsoft, and I can \"merge\" offline and online accounts so I can log into the same \"player\" on the server using both Mojang auth servers or my own, using different credentials if I so choose.",

          "text": "As many others have mentioned Home Assistant.\n\nBut more to the point - as soon as you want anything to be tied together. So many services either don't provide APIs, or have shuttered/heavily restricted APIs which they used to have.\n\nThat means if you want to use them you have to leverage backdoors (like reverse engineered APIs) instead of official methods to do something (e.g. download an original activity file from Strava) or everything (download anything from Garmin Connect), and even then that might not be possible.\n\nAs soon as you need to have anything linked together it becomes a delicate stack of cards that's prone to braking at any moment and often seems to be impossible.  Self Hosted isn't perfect, but usually has good enough APIs to support you doing what the hell you want, or simply just picks up changes you make to files/sidecar files anyway (and allows you to directly access those files).\n\nOne example in my stack is the simple operation of Geotagging photos taken on my DSL and uploading to Google Photos.  Without a self hosted stack this would be impossible - Google haven't seen fit to allow externally taken photos to be a) uploaded easily, b) tagged with locations from Google Timeline & Google Health activities. (Let alone anything more exotic like blending Google Timeline with Garmin Connect to improve accuracy).\n\nWith self hosting that functionality has been possible, where all the sketchy limitations come down to the reliance on third parties (oh how I wish Garmin Connect allowed watches/Bike Computers to directly upload to S3-Compatible/Box/Google Drive/OneDrive/SFTP type storage).\n\nFirstly is a self written and hosted platform similar to Dawarich that takes the location data from my phone via Home Assistant (the latter calls a webhook) every 30 seconds/change; imports activities from Garmin Connect (via garmin\\_export, triggered by Home Assistant webhooks in response to Garmin Connect app notifications); and imports GPS Logger logs (car, transit, taxi) - uploaded by Folder Sync which also triggers a webhook to scan.\n\nI call this Dawarich like platform Sainz as that's the VMs name and I'm rubbish at naming stuff - it's not actually Dawarich as it started as a logger for Transit trips and snowballed from their such it now includes location tracking from Forza Horizon too.\n\nThis means I have a record of accurate (GPS Logger, Garmin) and approx. (Home Assistant App) coordinates for where I've been.\n\nSo when I go out with my DSLR, which is usually on a walk being recorded on my watch, I will already have all the locations recorded in a database by the end of the day when I get home/to the hotel.\n\nI am then able to :-\n\n1. Insert Memory Card into Tablet and open Folder Sync - copies photos to my tablet (1st Backup).\n2. A second Folder Sync pair then copies these to my NAS (and when done triggers a webhook on Sainz) - (2nd Backup) which can often take all night and longer\n3. Once those photos are uploaded the webhook it triggers scans for all the files in that scratch folder and logs to a database.\n4. Both 3. and the Activities uploads tasks queue another task to scan photos - all photos with no tagged geodata that have a location recorded within 5 seconds get written to a library folder used by PhotoPrism and then tagged with the Geolocation data (those without any Geolocation are copied anyway).  If the file is over two weeks old it falls back on the Home Assistant App location data if it's within 30 seconds (the two weeks wait is to allow me time to fix garmin\\_export issues which happen while on holiday).\n5. This triggers a library scan in PhotoPrism to pickup all the new photos\n6. Then triggers another task which uploads all GeoTagged photos to Google Photos (using rclone) and to my backup cloud storage (3rd Backup - again using rclone).  The Google Photos limitation is because you can't delete/amend/modify previously uploaded photos using their pathetic API.\n7. I also have a script which writes the PhotoPrism changes (Titles and Descriptions) back to the files, which thanks to using Rclone means those get backed up to the original photo on my cloud storage.\n\nWith all this place it also means all my Forza Horizon screenshots (uploaded to One Drive by the Xbox and pulled down with Rclone) get tagged with their in game location (not that I'm actually doing that with anything yet)",

My original motivation to even learning how to set it up was so that I could get better FPS while gaming and programming at the same time 😂. I don't do that much anymore but the principal still applies. By offloading work to my server, which has 16gb of ram and a 6-core CPU, my laptop stays running much snappier. Of course this wouldn't be an issue if I owned a really expensive laptop, but alas I do not. Old office towers on the other hand are very cheap on the used market.\n\nI should note I also SSH into the server at the same time, so I have a terminal window open beside Code Server for convenience and running TUIs and whatnot.",

                  "text": "I'm not who you replied to, but I host something vaguely similar. It's called TubeArchivist and is primarily intended as a GUI wrapper for yt-dlp and aimed at archival. It isn't particularly like invidious, because it's a GUI for your videos that you yourself have downloaded on your machine as opposed to being an alternative GUI for other videos that live on YouTube.\n\nIt doesn't have a recommendation algorithm per se, but it does suggest similar videos based on keywords and tags, which are still available on YouTube but are hidden in the GUI. And it also has subtitle indexing which makes it easier to search for videos based on subtitles. And it has comment saving as well, though that isn't searchable. I actually find the comments much, much easier to search through since they're all loaded in at once on the one page.\n\nYou can set it up to either retain videos forever, which is what I do since I'm in it for the sake of archival and data hoarding. Or you can configure it to automatically delete videos you've watched X days after you watched them. And you also define what channels it should download videos from, how many videos it should download, if you do or do not want shorts/streams, and so on. Pretty much everything is configurable, as you'd probably expect from a foss project.\n\nAlthough it's not invidious at all, I thought I'd mention it because it kind of fits OPs question (I find it considerably more responsive than the laggy mess YouTube's desktop UI is), and in the long term, once I've hoarded enough videos, I plan to begin watching videos exclusively via TA and not on YouTube itself. Sadly I don't think I'll be able to entirely escape YouTube/google, because you do need to supply a cookie if you want to watch age restricted or members only videos (of you have a channel membership). But at least I'll get a say in how and what videos I want to watch\n\nThere's no algorithm though. It does have APIs, so I suppose there's nothing stopping you from making your own, maybe that's the sort of thing a small, locally hosted, AI model would be good for. But nobody has done anything like that as far as I'm aware (truthfully probably intentional - a lot of people want to get away from algorithms anyway)",

Hudu's GUI looked the best, but I'm really the only one looking at it lol so that part didn't matter to me. Oh, and  IT Flows simplified backend maintenance is great too for troubleshooting quick small problems (like why cron email job didn't fire off, etc).\n\nI've used IT Flow for years for my small IT Firm, supporting many local businesses, their individual assets (you can log notes, IP's, log network layout and passwords etc) and the software does an incredible job as a CRM + way more. If it helps to mention, I used InvoiceNinja (which was also great) before that, but the invoicing alone wasn't enough.\n\nAlso, is it too late to add OPNsense?

TLDR: keep a copy of your docker volume AND create a sqlite backup for good measure. \n\nPersonally I have 2 physical copies on an external disk of the whole docker folder i've set up, plus an encrypted offsite backup on a VPS. I should be golden with the 3-2-1 backup strategy rule. (Edit: oh, and I have borgbackup set up, so my backups are actually incremental, deduplicated and compressed. So I could easily roll back to a specific date in the event that my data has been corrupted (say, I get crypto'd))\n\nALSO, as you mentioned, password is rather critical, so I have a monthly calendar reminder where I manually export the Vaultwarden database (from the Web UI under Tools) in a JSON file, and here's the kicker: KeepassXC can create a new password vault USING Bitwarden's exported JSON.

          "text": "At least to me it sounded like you're actually asking for two categories.  Self-hosted FOSS software that's better than proprietary competitors in terms of the quality of software...  And situations where even if it's the same software there's a tangible, non-philisophical, non-hypothetical benefit to self-hosting vs using the paid, external form of a service.\n\nFor me the real standout standout \"I wouldn't even bother with an external service, this is the only way this product works for me\" categories are having a good media server and good password manager.\n\nMedia server:  Selfhosting a media server cuts down on network load since all those bits are flying between server and client on a local network, vs everyone in your house streaming from the internet and clogging up your internet connection.  Plus self-hosted media servers are going to let you install whatever plugins you want for customizing what \\*you\\* want to use a media server for:  Listening to music on the bus or watching movies in 4K glory at home.  Won't inject ads at arbitrary, algorithmically determined but utterly stupid points in the show/movie the way some streaming services do.  Obviously when you compare vs a streaming service like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video there's a huge tradeoff in terms of library size and effort of library curation, but at the same time if the movie I want to watch is on my jellyfin server and on Amazon Prime Video.... Jellyfin is going to be the higher quality, no-ads experience.\n\nPassword manager:  I guess for me this is more about hypothetical situations and peace of mind and less about compared featureset, since I self-host vaultwarden and I could easily just replace it with a free tier bitwarden account with feature parity.  But over the past few years the number of data breaches of password managers has been *daunting*.  And I get that they store everything in encrypted blocks and yay for them, but those encrypted blocks are paired with email addresses that have probably lost a multitude of passwords in *other* data breaches available on the dark web.  I just don't even want to deal with any of this.  My vaultwarden instance and the  internet are completely unaware of eachother.  I tailscale in when I need to access it from the bitwarden app on my phone.  I'm not quite so naive as to think I've built an impenetrable fortress, as so many of those have been breached.  But I've at least raised the difficulty way past what breaching it would be worth, and for a password manager it needs to stay that way.",

Context here matters, so I'll continue. \n\nYou go into features or experiences.\n\nBeing in control; in more ways than one.  My data, my rules. I don't have to worry about strangers (developers, maintainers, random contractors, 'advertising partners') slurping up my information, leaking sensitive information, or selling out to advertisers.  This is a big deal for me, as I've grown up relatively secure with the mindset that the internet is the wild-west and don't carelessly share things with internet strangers. Many of these big cloud services are nothing more than big strangers.\n\nCost savings.  This is hard to always quantify... but some things on the internet are simply too expensive to justify paying someone else to do it. Dropping $300-400CAD on a 'new' mini PC could theoretically pay itself back in less than a year depending on what you run.  Buying 'used' or repurposing old gear really only needs replacement parts and power to be considered... but I'll gladly 'waste' 10-20Watts hosting something myself.   \nThis holds true for me with storage as well... I could self-host 42TB at a rate of $5.16CAD/mo if I want it paid back in 12 months... I could triple this deployment and self-host mirrors at family/friend locations and pay it back over 3 years.\n\nWhere cloud providers excel (in my opinion) .. is where you either \\*can't\\*, or \\*don't\\* want to own your own hardware or service.. Short-term use items are perfect use-cases for cloud.  Use it, pay monthly for a bit, then walk away... be careful though... there's nothing more permanent than that which is supposed to be temporary.  \nEmail is one of those things that can technically be done, but the cloud giants have really made it difficult to do this without ending up on a dozen different block-lists.  Email is a tough one to justify either way... but it's becoming increasingly more important with the trends in the internet... verify your ID / age to participate in chat, social media, etc.. Combine this with the fact that many online services don't have proper sign-in authentication/security and heavily \\*rely\\* on email addresses to send you sign-in codes or magic links... loose your email for whatever reason and you loose more than access to some forums and a couple video games... even if you have credentials for sites, an increasing number will email you anyway when you attempt to sign-in.",

Of course self hosting music streaming and subscribing to music streaming are drastically different when it comes to WHAT you listen to, but the fact that my self-hosted library is easier to navigate in an app that has better features than any of the paid ones blows not only my mind but the minds of lots of friends I show it to. And since I control what's on it, I can put my own band on it or anything else I record. I can rip demos and other stuff that local bands from my youth recorded and self-released in tiny quantities, which is a huge plus, because that stuff will never be on any streamer. I have explicit versions of albums that many streamers only have in radio or otherwise censored edits as well. So for me, self-hosting my music and rediscovering albums I bought as a teen is absolutely mind blowing.  \n\nI also love actually just having network shares, which isn't strictly in the same category as other \"proper\" sevices I have, but literally just having folders accessible from the phone, my PC, my laptop, my steam deck and being able to share files with family through a dedicated LAN share blows any cloud storage out of the water.",

Others already mentioned jellyfin and the *arr stack. I just throw Audiobookshelf in there. It's a selfhosted platform for managing and listening to podcasts. Although podcasts are free (that's also how this server sources the podcasts) apps like Spotify or Apple Podcasts have annoying ads and try to make you listen to stuff you don't want. Also Apple Podcasts is censoring heavily the decription and notes of every podcast without letting you or the hosts know.\n\nSmarthome.

Like:  \n* Why would you host a Nextcloud server (or use something like dropbox, google drive or onedrive, for that matter), if you can just store all of your files on your desktop, which you synchronise with your laptop over `ssh` using `unison`? \n* What is the point of a \"Google photos\" (or Immich), if you can just connect your phone (or your DSLR camera) to the PC using a USB cable to copy your stuff over?

As I mentioned in my previous comment, I keep the data on my laptop and my desktop synchronised using `unison`, over `ssh`. This way, they largely function as each other's backup, with only the most recent changes on one machine not yet being present on the other. Furthermore, my desktop contains a second hard drive (an old, slow, rotating one) with a third copy of everything I consider worth backing up.\n\nThere are some ways in which I could improve on my data security, of course; like:  \n* None of my partitions is encrypted, so data can get stolen along with the computer it's on (provided that the thief is a Linux expert). I am thinking of implementing LUKS encryption on my laptop hard drive, though.\n* I do not have a permanent offsite backup, so if my house burns down (while my laptop is \"home\"), so does my data. I do, however, believe that my hard drive contents would not be my main concern in that situation.",

I use it myself via Claude Code. They’re a fantastic productivity booster when used under supervision/with manual code review.\n\nBut for the time being I do think it should be disclosed.  AI still makes tons of errors and if your users know ahead of time they can pay a little closer attention.\n\nCheers",

I did mine with Hetzner (not being paid by them to say this, nor do I have any relationship with them besides being an ordinary customer. Im not endorsing them or implying anything about them other to say that they unblocked port 25 when i asked and that their VPS was able to successfully pass email traffic without issue) and it did work but as all things your mileage may vary. \n\nMail in a box was nice because it was basically just a glorified wizard to install the email server, all the way down to automatically provisioning certs through LE. when it finished it spat out a list of all the weird DNS records that email requires to function securely and properly and from there I was able to throw that list into CloudFl@re (my public DNS provider) and fuhgeddaboudit. \n\nthe two remaining caveats with that is that MiaB has a default 10 minute spam greylist, which makes receiving 2FA codes via email very difficult as they sit in purgatory for 10 minutes before hitting your inbox, and the other caveat was that it took a small amount of convincing to get Gmail to accept email from MiaB without dumping it into the recipient’s spam hole. there was a way i was able to like register myself with gMail or something as a trusted email server but i cannot remember what it is. \n\nall in all, when i did it, MiaB took about two hours of work to go from “just sshed into the VPS for the first time” to having gmail successfully receive mail from my server. \n\nit did work pretty well, was fairly easy for me, and seemed to be secure enough out of the box. that being said, im in agreement with the other users that for personal email it’s better to just register a custom domain and use Google Workspace or Exchange Online or something. self hosting is arguably super worth it for a ton of things but there’s almost nothing that a self hosted email server can offer that an inexpensive commercial business email service cannot. \n\ni still have my MiaB server though and for those of us who frequent r/homelab and rely on Exchange Online, MiaB is super useful for SMTP alerts for your other self hosted things, especially since basic SMTP AUTH is being deprecated far faster than many open source projects are able to implement modern authentication protocols instead",

If so, then your records must be in perfect working order.\n\nAnd if the server IP you are using happens to be on any spam blocklists like Spamhaus, you're in for a difficult ride. Or if you're trying to host email from a home ISP, which blocks certain ports like 25.\n\nLike I said, it was a good learning experience to understand the process and how it all works. But to do it just to get email? No. No way.\n\nMine is still working to this day, and I'm in good standing with the spam companies, and I can send/receive to or from any service.

Granted I'm not going to use email for anything where security is critical because it's not secure even in my home. Even the mundane stuff has value we've not considered though. My email is also my shared contacts, calendars, tasks....\n\nI self host file syncing services for exactly the same reason. I don't do social media, reuse usernames/passwords, post anything potentially self identifying. I don't have camera's at my house that send anything to the cloud. Etc.\n\nAll this stuff would be easier and likely more reliable to not self host for a reasonable fee. That's not the point.",

Unlike TV/movie streaming which has become so fragmented and requires either juggling subscriptions or paying for an obscene amount of them to watch all the content I want; Music is still a fair price. I’m happy with the music streaming service I use, the price seems fair, and I get all the music I want to listen to in a single service. Very much like streaming was for years before I started uh… obtaining my TV/Movies elsewhere. \n\n2. E-Mail. Just not worth the headache. \n\n3. Password manager. Too high risk. Plus it gives me a completely separate source of environment variables combined with a private GitHub repository for everything. This creates paranoid levels of separation where both services are needed to re-create my homelab services. But it can still be done with minimal effort if I had a catastrophic failure that necessitated a clean new install of everything. \n\n4. VPN. I could pay for a cheap VPS and run headcale or wireguard. But Tailscale is free and works great. There are solid arguments for self hosting here. But for me, homelab services are all about either saving money, or doing things that cannot practically be done with cloud services. I’m not actually someone who is “opposed” to the cloud. I just don’t want to pay for services that don’t give me value commensurate with the price. So this is an area where Tailscale works just fine so there’s no advantage *for me* to host on my own. Similarly I use another VPN provider to watch blacked out live sports. \n\n5. Cloud storage. I definitely have storage IN my homelab but I pay for cloud storage for an off-site backup rather than hosting my own offsite backup in some other location. I pay for both a bulk storage provider for backups, and iCloud. I absolutely could cut out iCloud and use something like Immich, but it’s $3/mo and super convenient.",

They're refusing to put their music on streaming services because it pays almost nothing, and instead opting to sell music digitally on platforms like Bandcamp and Qobuz, or selling physical releases on CDs, vinyl, or cassette direct to consumer.",

There are tools like Queue-times to estimate wait times but it's not very precise. Turns out the parks radio dispatcher transmits their actual attendance numbers once per hour over their two-way radio system. So I setup an SDR and have faster-whisper running in a container to transcribe it, PostgreSQL database setup to store all of those transcriptions, and some scripts in Python to parse the actual attendance counts all so that I can just look at my phone real quick and see if it's busy or not.

Another useful thing i did was write a written plan for if my house burns down or if my server explodes one day and how to go abt recovery in those cases. Either way, having redundancy is what makes me rrust that my docs wont let me down. So id say if you dont trust yourself not to nuke it, plan for if you did. Although not having a buddy whose also into self hosting can raise issue, if you drop a sneaky mini pc at a relatives house you could backup to there. But if you dont have anyone uou can trust with a server or who is okay with it, i understand not wanting to self host that",

I'm not talking about non-authoritative DNS only used for your own clients, e.g. PiHole.

If you don't have a music library, I've got good news, used CDs are *incredibly* cheap; and if you actually care about supporting the bands you like, buying a single new CD of theirs will give them more money than they will *ever* get from you streaming their music on Spotify.  Spotify pays artists so poorly that I know several bands who have openly stated they would rather people just pirate their music than use Spotify.  That's not to mention, of course, that music also regularly gets removed from Spotify, so you can't rely on anything being on there long-term.\n\nThe answer, as other people have mentioned, is e-mail.  I ran my own mail server for >15 years, and the amount of maintenance and knowledge required to actually do it right is simply not worth it.

Your outbound mail gets the relay's established IP reputation instead of fighting from scratch with residential/VPS IP ranges that are pre-emptively blacklisted.\n\nThe trade-off is philosophical more than technical: at that point, you're self-hosting the *storage and IMAP/webmail side*, but your outbound path still runs through a third party who can see metadata (and potentially content, depending on your threat model). For most people that's a totally reasonable compromise — you get the privacy of not having Google reading your inbox while still having reliable delivery.\n\nI run mailcow with a relay for outbound and it's been rock solid. The only thing I'd add is that some relays (especially free tiers) will suspend your account quickly if anything looks even slightly spammy, so make sure your DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) is bulletproof and monitor your sending patterns.",

Plexamp is awesome. I also kind of \\_like\\_ how this way of cataloguing music enocurages me to listen to full albums again, I forgot how much I liked that when I was younger. I'm also excited to go and browse discs at my local music store again. If I spend 13$ on used discs per month at that store I'll build a respectable collection of music of time and that's 13$ not going to a megacorp that actively supports executives that also run military industrial complex-feeding companies around the world.",

I can replicate it about 80% but its the last 20% that is the most valuable to music- discovery. My daughter has discovered so much music over the last 6 months and I don't want to take that away from her. I cannot replicate that unless I have the equvelent library to spotify.

The sweet spot IMO is owning a custom domain for your email and using imap so you have a local backup of your mail.\n\nThe main thing with email is that it’s a two party system, and whoever is hosting email for your correspondents will see the messages, so the privacy angle is much lower than other services. At the same time, spam filters perform better with more data, and deliverability will be more reliable with a major host (yes, there are things you can do to mitigate most deliverability issues so for a lot of people this might not be a huge factor, but if it matters it always favors the existing providers). If you own your domain you minimize the risk of platform fuckery because you can just point your mx record at a different host.\n\nSecurity is a factor too. A lot of big platforms are terrible at privacy but good at security, and far too many services have zero safeguards if your email address is compromised.\n\nOverall: self hosting email is technically feasible, moderately risky, and has very low to negative ROI so it’s not really worth it.",

It's a culmination of everything I've learned over the years, fixing all the bugs and feature requests I've gotten through GitHub and my emails.\n\nFor those of you who are unaware of this project, and nor should you be, Reactive Resume is a **free and open-source** resume builder that focuses on completely free and untethered access to a tool most people need at some point in their life, without giving up your privacy and money. In a nutshell, it’s just a resume builder, nothing fancy, but no corners have been cut in providing the best user experience possible for the end user.\n\nHere are some features I thought were worth highlighting:\n\n* **Improved user experience,** now easier than ever to keep your resume up-to-date.\n* **Great for single page or multi-page resumes,** or even long-form PDFs.\n* **Easier self-hosting** with examples on how to set it up on your server.\n* **Immensely better documentation**, to help guide users on how to use the project.\n* There’s ***some*** **AI in there too**, where you bring your own key, no subscriptions or paywalls. There's also an **agent skill** for those who want to try it out on their own.\n* **Improved account security** using 2FA or Passkeys, also add your own SSO provider (no more SSO tax!).\n* **13 resume templates**, and many more to come. If you know React/Tailwind CSS, it’s very easy to build you own templates as well. Also **supports Custom CSS**, so you can make any template look exactly the way you like it to.\n* **Available in multiple languages**. If you know a second language and would love to help contribute translations, please head over to the docs to learn more.\n* **Did I mention it’s free?**\n\nI sincerely hope you enjoy using the brand new edition of Reactive Resume almost as much as I had fun building it.\n\n**If you have the time, please check out** [**rxresu.me**](https://rxresu.me)**.**  \n**I'd love to hear what you think ❤️**\n\nOr, if you’d like to know more about the app, head over to the docs at [docs.rxresu.me](https://docs.rxresu.me/)\n\nOr, if you’d like to take a peek at the code, the GitHub Repository is at [amruthpillai/reactive-resume](https://github.com/amruthpillai/reactive-resume).\n\n***Note:*** I do expect a lot of traffic on launch day and I don’t have the most powerful of servers, so if the app is slow or doesn’t load for you right now, please check back in later or the next day.",

I actually like doing bullets, 3 bullets...one to show strategic/critical thinking, one to highlight technical. One to highlight your ethos. \n\nBecause of the layout with 'skills' and 'experience' left justified you massively shrink the width of the area where you write your experience. Which means  it appears way longer than it is.\n\nYour skill section is wild. Like good on you for being familiar with such a broad tech stack, but it overwhelms. Unless they call our a specific technology you can cut tons out of this section. Example: Databases....then you list like a million flavors of SQL. You could simplify it to databases: sql/nosql/graph/whatever. Or even more. Just say database management.\n\nYour bullet points are also too wordy and contain lots unnecessary fluff that dilutes your message. You only include 'impact' as the last bullet when it should be in every bullet. None of it is really tangible...example:\n\n> Acted as a key full-time on-site technical resource, collaborating directly with Tier-1 consulting partners (\"Big 4\" and big consultancy companies) and the client's internal teams to align on solutions and accelerate project delivery.\n\nCan be simplified to:\n\n> Accelerated delivery by x% through technical and functional alignment between Big 4 partners and internal teams.\n\nCaptures hard value. Strips out the fluff. \n\nYour certificate section is kind of crazy. Listing 14 Salesforce certs? Don't do that. Just say something like:\n\n> Salesforce subject matter expert with 14 active certifications, encompassing the full technical stack.\n\nReally its not bad. You have the experience.

We've tackled the duplicate book problem once and for all, built a sick stats system that actually shows you how your library is being used, added dynamic/Magic Shelves, and a powerful & robust new OAuth system. The amount of new features and fixes in this release is incredible. This is the biggest, most community-driven update CWA has ever had and I'm very grateful to everyone that helped work on it.\" - **CrocodileStick**\n\n**If you enjoy the project and want to support the coffee fund for v5.0.0, you can do so here:**\n\n[Support the project here on Ko-Fi!](https://ko-fi.com/crocodilestick)\n\n# Release V4.0.0 Changelog\n\n# 🚀 Major Features\n\n# Here is the highlight reel:\n\n* **🔍 Smart Duplicate Detection & Resolution:** A completely rebuilt hybrid SQL/Python engine. It detects 95% of duplicates other systems miss (ignoring articles like \"The\", fuzzy matching, etc.). Includes **Auto-Resolution** to merge books automatically and **Scheduled Scans**.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/udmjcnu2yagg1.gif\n\n* **✨ Magic Shelves:** Dynamic, rules-based collections. Create shelves based on tags, ratings, series, or publication dates (e.g., \"Rated 4+ stars\", \"Published in 2024\"). **Bonus:** These sync directly to Kobo devices!\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z0co4j24yagg1.gif\n\n* **📊 Deep Stats Centre:** A brand new dashboard. Track **User Activity** (reading velocity, top users), **Library Stats** (format distribution, language), and **Peak Usage Hours**. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/i99zx0t4yagg1.gif\n\n* **📧 Auto-Send to eReader:** Set it and forget it. New books can be automatically emailed to your Kindle/Kobo/eReader immediately upon ingest, with smart delays to allow for metadata fetching first.\n* **🛡️ Robust OAuth Rewrite:** Completely rewritten authentication. Now supports **LDAP, Reverse Proxy (Authelia/Authentik), and OIDC** natively with auto-user creation. No more redirect loops.\n* **✅ EPUB Fixer 2.0 (No more E999 Errors):** Specifically targets Amazon's strict rejection criteria. Automatically fixes language tags, XML declarations, and broken CSS so your Send-to-Kindle works reliably.\n* **🏷️ Auto-Metadata Fetching:** CWA can now automatically fetch metadata (Google Books, Kobo, Hardcover, etc.) during ingest or before sending to a device.\n\n# ⚡ Performance & Quality of Life\n\n* **Performance Overhaul:** Search is drastically faster, and we’ve moved to WebP thumbnails which reduces page weight by 97%. Large libraries (50k+ books) load instantly now.\n* **Network Share Mode:** Running on a NAS/Unraid? We added a specific mode to handle NFS/SMB locking issues to prevent database corruption.\n* **Better Kobo Integration:** Improved sync reliability, annotations, and a new \"Featured Products\" endpoint.\n* **Hardcover.app ID Fetch:** Automatically links your library to Hardcover for better tracking.\n* **Enhanced Manual Sending:** Want to send a book to a friend? You can now type in any email address on the fly to send a book without creating a user account.\n\n# 🔗 Links\n\n* **Full Change Log:** [Link to GitHub Release/ Changelog](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/releases/tag/v4.0.0)\n* **Docker Hub:** [Link to DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/crocodilestick/calibre-web-automated)\n* **Repo:** [Link to GitHub Project Page](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated)\n\n# Upcoming changes 🔮\n\nMajor changes are still coming to CWA including:\n\n* A brand new Svelte based Frontend. The days of the current Bootstrap UI are numbers and migrating to Svelte ensures that the new UI will still be easy to edit and add to for as many contributors as possible due to it's very familiar syntax to traditional sites and can be compiled with Capacitor for native mobile apps which is very exiting\n* A new web reader, epub.js is a little dated now and there are now much better alternatives\n* A much more robust & powerful progress syncing system that will be able to have CWA act as a single source of truth for reading progress no matter what device you read from\n* Full Text Search functionality\n* 🐁 is coming very soon, the integration just had to be as sensible & respectful to the 🐁 and it's servers as possible and a good balance has now been reached\n\n**A massive thank you to the 60+ contributors who helped test, translate, and code this release.**\n\n**TLDR: CWA now has a new, robust OAuth system, a new smart Duplicate Detection & Auto-Resolution system, a brand-new & very powerful Stats Dashboard, Auto-Send to eReader functionality as well as Automatic Metadata Fetching, a new and Improved Automatic EPUB Fixer service, a new Network Share mode for increased compatibility & reliability with NFS & SMB shares, a major performance overhaul making the whole service more lightweight than ever and so much more!

Keeping a big Calibre library clean is usually just pain and vibes, so having something that actually does fuzzy matching and scheduled scans is huge.\n\nReally like the direction with Magic Shelves and the stats centre too. That’s the kind of stuff that makes a self hosted library feel like a “real” product instead of just a folder of epubs with a UI stapled on. Also appreciate the Network Share mode callout, feels like half the issues in r/selfhosted are “NFS did me dirty again.”\n\nCurious about the Svelte frontend plans: are you aiming to keep things editable for people who just want to tweak templates and CSS, or will it mostly be for folks comfortable building and compiling the app?\n\nEither way, this is the kind of update that makes me want to blow up my current setup and redo it properly.",

As to Svelte, one of the main reasons for choosing it was that it's the most community friendly modern framework available since all of it's syntax is almost identical to normal html, CSS & JS with a few \"runes\" sprinkled in here and there so it should be easy for people to pick up and keep making changes to.

Be extra sure to document anything bank or finance related. \n\n- document day to day chores that break the house if not done properly or get you in trouble with the government that only you do (like how to clear the Central hvac filters or how to do taxes)\n\nTech stuff:\n- regularly backup any important data to preferably ONE external hdd and make use it is stored in a simple file system. That means scanned documents, pictures, perhaps phone backups, documentation and digital instructions. You should not expect your SO to do anything more than plug it in her laptop, browse and double click. Presumably tech and self hosting was your hobby and not hers. \n\n- make it so any custom hardware can be simply unplugged (routers, switches, servers etc).

It doesn't hide or abstract anything, which is one of it's strengths.",

              "text": "I was thinking the same, and i'm trying to solve it, my idea was that for suggestion i could query the listenbrainz radio recommendations with my listening stats to get some nice playlists daily or weekly, then filter what i already have, download them with squid or smth, re-filter what isn't available and then push them to navidrome.\n\nit should be simple api calls only, as i don't have to generate the suggestion myself, that's seems to be a quite deep rabbit hole.\n\nthat's the feasible short term solution i thought of, spotify is too locked rn, any downloader is suffering big time, using tidal seems to be a breeze instead\n\njellyfin wasn't really jamming with music assistant lately so i had to switch to navidrome for music, but the procedure should be almost the same.\n\nbtw building a suggestion engine with this dataset is definitely possible, but i'm not that deep into it yet  😂\n\nEDIT: (seems like [https://github.com/metabrainz/troi-recommendation-playground](https://github.com/metabrainz/troi-recommendation-playground) is the tool that could do all of it, i thought it was an interface but it actually implements the generation engine for recommendations, radios, etc. based on a given source, which, i suppose, could be connected to this API.)",

That maintenance burden killed the project within a year.\n\nIf goal is learning exercise that's valid, if it's for production use you might save months by extending existing player that already handles the hard parts like transcoding and client apps. What specific feature gap are you trying to fill?",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nQuick refresher for those who haven't seen our previous posts ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nx5l9h/dispatcharr_your_ultimate_iptv_stream_management/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1ptejul/dispatcharr_release_v0151_iptv_stream_epg/)): **Dispatcharr** is an open-source middleware for managing IPTV streams and EPG data. It doesn't provide any content - it simply helps you import your own sources (M3U playlists, EPG/XMLTV, Xtream/XC credentials) and export them in whatever format your client needs (M3U, EPG, Xtream/XC, HDHomeRun). Think of it as a translator between your providers and your apps (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Tivimate, etc.).\n\nWe've been busy since our last post, so here's what's new in **v0.18.1**! If you'd like to see changelogs for minor updates where we did not post here, you can view them here on GitHub: [Dispatcharr Changelogs](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n**New Features**\n\n**Editable Channel Table Mode**\n\n* Robust inline editing mode for the channels table - edit channel fields (name, number, group, EPG, logo) directly in the table without opening a modal\n* EPG and logo columns support searchable dropdowns with instant filtering and keyboard navigation for fast assignment\n* Drag-and-drop reordering of channels when unlocked, with persistent order updates (Closes #333)\n* Group column uses a searchable dropdown for quick group assignment\n\n**Stats Page \"Now Playing\" Programs**\n\n* Added \"Now Playing\" program information for active streams with smart polling that only fetches EPG data when programs are about to change\n* Currently playing program title displayed with live broadcast indicator\n* Expandable program descriptions via chevron button\n* Progress bar showing elapsed and remaining time for currently playing programs\n* Efficient POST-based API endpoint supporting batch channel queries\n* Smart scheduling that fetches new program data 5 seconds after current program ends\n* Added preview button to active stream cards on stats page\n\n**Stream Filters**\n\n* \"Only Unassociated\" filter option to quickly find streams not assigned to any channels (Closes #667)\n* \"Hide Stale\" filter to quickly hide streams marked as stale\n\n**Enhanced Logo & Table Caching**\n\n* Client-side logo caching with Cache-Control and Last-Modified headers\n* Browsers now cache logos locally for 4 hours (local files) and respect upstream cache headers (remote logos)\n* Reduces network traffic and nginx load while providing faster page loads.\n\n**DVR Recording Remux Improvements**\n\n* Two-stage TS→MP4→MKV fallback strategy when direct TS→MKV conversion fails due to timestamp issues\n* Automatic recovery from provider timestamp corruption with proper cleanup of partial files\n\n**Mature Content Filtering**\n\n* Added `is_adult` boolean field to both Stream and Channel models with database indexing\n* Automatically populated during M3U/XC refresh operations\n* UI controls in channel edit form and bulk edit form for easy management\n* XtreamCodes API support with proper integer formatting\n* User-level content filtering: Non-admin users can opt to hide mature content channels across all interfaces via \"Hide Mature Content\" toggle in user settings\n\n**Table Header Pin Toggle**\n\n* Pin/unpin table headers to keep them visible while scrolling (Closes #663)\n* Toggle available in channel table menu and UI Settings page\n* Setting persists across sessions and applies to all tables\n\n**Cascading Filters for Streams Table**\n\n* Improved filter usability with hierarchical M3U and Group dropdowns\n* M3U acts as parent filter showing only active/enabled accounts\n* Group options dynamically update to display only groups available in selected M3U(s) (Closes #647)\n\n**Streams Table Tooltips**\n\n* Added descriptive tooltips to top-toolbar buttons and row action icons\n* 500ms open delay for consistent behavior with existing table header tooltips\n\n**Changes & Improvements**\n\n**API Documentation**\n\n* Comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all series-rules endpoints\n* Detailed operation descriptions, request/response schemas, and error handling documentation\n\n**Data Loading & Initialization Refactor**\n\n* Major performance improvement reducing initial page load time by eliminating duplicate API requests\n* Fixed authentication race condition where `isAuthenticated` was set before data loading completed\n* Consolidated version and environment settings fetching with caching\n* Implemented stale fetch prevention in ChannelsTable and StreamsTable\n* Added initialization guards to prevent double-execution during React StrictMode development\n\n**Table Preferences Architecture**\n\n* Table preferences (header pin and table size) now managed with centralized state management and localStorage persistence\n* Migrated `table-size` preference to centralized `useTablePreferences` hook\n* Streams table button labels: Renamed \"Remove\" to \"Delete\" and \"Add Stream to Channel\" to \"Add to Channel\"\n\n**Frontend Testing & CI**\n\n* Frontend tests GitHub workflow now uses Node.js 24 (matching Dockerfile)\n* Runs on both `main` and `dev` branch pushes and pull requests\n\n**Streams Filter Performance**\n\n* Replaced inefficient reverse foreign key NULL check with Count annotation approach\n* Query time reduced from 4-5 seconds to under 500ms for large datasets (75k+ streams)\n\n**Bug Fixes**\n\n**Channels Table & Pagination**\n\n* Fixed \"Invalid page\" error notifications when filters reduced result set\n* API layer now automatically detects invalid page errors, resets to page 1, and retries transparently (Fixes #864)\n\n**Stream Display & Network**\n\n* Fixed long IP addresses overlapping adjacent columns by adding truncation with tooltips (Fixes #712)\n* Fixed nginx startup failure due to group name mismatch in non-container deployments (Fixes #877)\n\n**Streaming & Dependency Updates**\n\n* Updated streamlink from 8.1.0 to 8.1.2 to fix YouTube live stream playback issues and improve Pluto TV ad detection (Fixes #869)\n\n**Date/Time Formatting**\n\n* Fixed date/time formatting across all tables to respect user's UI preferences (time format and date format)\n* All components now use centralized `format()` helper for consistency\n\n**Code Quality**\n\n* Removed unused imports from table components\n* Fixed build-dev.sh script stability with proper path resolution\n\n**Streams Table & Container**\n\n* Fixed TypeError on streams table load after container restart\n* Added robust data validation and type coercion to handle malformed filter options\n* MultiSelect components now safely convert group names and filter out null/undefined values\n\n**XtreamCodes API**\n\n* Fixed XtreamCodes API crash when channels have NULL channel\\_group\n* Now gracefully handles channels without assigned channel\\_group by assigning them to \"Default Group\"\n\n**Table Layout**\n\n* Fixed streams table column header overflow with fixed-height headers (30px max-height)\n* Shows first selection plus count (e.g., \"Sport +3\") (Fixes #613)\n\n**VOD Logo Management**\n\n* Fixed VOD logo cleanup button count to display total count across all pages\n* Fixed VOD refresh failures when logos are deleted by using `logo_id` instead of lazy-loaded `logo` object\n* Improved orphaned logo detection\n\n**Channel Profile & User Restrictions**\n\n* Fixed channel profile filtering to properly restrict content based on assigned channel profiles for all non-admin users\n* Ensures standard users with channel profiles are properly restricted\n\n**Docker & System**\n\n* Fixed NumPy baseline detection in Docker entrypoint\n* Fixed SettingsUtils frontend tests for new grouped settings architecture\n\n**Security**\n\n* Updated react-router from 7.11.0 to 7.12.0 to address vulnerabilities:\n   * **High**: Open Redirect XSS vulnerability in Action/Server Action Request Processing\n   * **Moderate**: SSR XSS vulnerability in ScrollRestoration component\n* Updated react-router-dom from 7.11.0 to 7.12.0\n* Fixed moderate severity Prototype Pollution vulnerability in Lodash\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* Dispatcharr does not provide media to stream or download. It is strictly a middleware for managing sources supplied by the end user.\n* Any discussion involving piracy or obtaining illegal sources is strictly prohibited.\n* When deploying via docker compose, the `docker-compose.aio.yml` is highly recommended.\n* Dispatcharr is available in Unraid Community Apps!\n\n**Links:**\n\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr)\n* [Documentation](https://dispatcharr.github.io/Dispatcharr-Docs/)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/tUyqNxkUKP)\n\n**Core Development Team**\n\n* [u/xxSergeantPandaxx](https://www.reddit.com/user/xxSergeantPandaxx/)\n* [u/OkinawaBoss](https://www.reddit.com/user/OkinawaBoss/)[ ](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dekzter/)\n* [u/Dekzter](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dekzter/)\n\nAnd a HUGE thank you to everyone that has contributed via PRs, tools, plugins, feature requests, and bug reports!\n\nWe'd love your feedback, bug reports, and feature ideas.

Basically live local, cable, premium and ppv channels for very very cheap compared to cable/sat.\n\nDisptcharr excells because it always checks the streams and reprioritizes them based on quality/stability.  That allows your TV to always work when you click on the channel rather than having multiples of the same channel with different streams sources that may or may not work on any given day.
