Some users raised concerns about limited spaces (servers) capabilities \n\nElement IS \"corpo-ish\", but it's still free and open-source, [licensed under the Affero General Public License v3](https://element.io/blog/sustainable-licensing-at-element-with-agpl/) and connects to the free, open-source, decentralized and end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Matrix protocol. FluffyChat, which you linked, is just another client that connects to the Matrix protocol like Element - though in the testing I've done, Element remains *by far* the most mature client nearest to Discord feature-parity.\n\nElement works great as a communication app, and works well as a Discord alternative - but some of Discord's more gaming-focused features (streaming, and in-game detection) do not exist in Element and are arguably outside of its scope. It very much is more \"corpo\" in the sense that it is intended as secure business collaboration software rather than as a gaming voice chat client. It would be rad if the community could fork Element and make a more gaming-focused version of it with streaming capabilities at a minimum.\n\nBut the entire Matrix ecosystem of different server software, server instances, and client software, makes it resistant to the bullshit Discord just pulled (and will pull, in the future, as investors demand more \"revenue streams\") and strongly protects user privacy.",

              "text": "XMPP is definitely not a replacement.\n\nI have been looking at XMPP. A lot. So I'm going to write a lot about why XMPP is not a replacement.\n\nThe biggest issue is everything is implemented as extensions (XEPs), all the good ones are marked experimental, nobody implements everything.\n\nNow even if we had a great client and server combo that implemented all the latest XEPs - the biggest missing feature (in my opinion) is video calling that utilizes a selective forwarding unit (SFU) with drop-in features.\n\nThe clients that do calling all do peer-to-peer which just does not scale past like 4-5 people. You really need an SFU so everybody isn't having to push their video out to every other participant and destroying their upload bandwidth.\n\nAnd every client I've tried does \"calls\" - you call up somebody or a group of people and they answer and join. Basically every call is this ephemeral room, Discord has persistent rooms that you just jump into.\n\nJitsi Meet is pretty close - it runs on XMPP, and has the discord-like drop-in but they're doing a bunch of custom, non-XEP stuff. So it doesn't work with any other clients. And all it does is audio/video anyway. \n\nAnd then on top of that - screen sharing with app audio. Discord just does it with no futz. I've got friend groups that will stream things to discord and people just drop in whenever. I think Movim is the only XMPP app that does any kind of screen sharing. But again I'm pretty sure it's all peer to peer so is doesn't scale, and I'm not sure if it captures app audio.\n\nAnd that's just the audio/video stuff.\n\nThere's the lack of emotes. Custom emotes are huge. There's a XEP for stickers but nobody implements it and even if they did - there's no concept of inline images mixed with text in XMPP, so the stickers XEP doesn't get you there.\n\n(There used to be inline images via XHTML-IM but that's deprecated).\n\nSpaces. XMPP has a new experimental XEP for spaces but nobody implements it and the XEP isn't clear at all on what they're supposed to actually do. They clearly intend to mimic discord \"servers\" but the whole thing is just a mess.\n\nGetting people signed up. There's been work for an invites concept but man is it confusing. Every server that has a web+invite registration process uses this same, incredibly confusing webpage that has never been used by a normal person.\n\nIf you get an invite to join a discord you get a webpage. If you don't have an account you sign up. You join their discord. You can start immediately using it in your browser.\n\nIf you get an invite to join an XMPP server you get this page that's like \"hey you need a client!\" with a QR code and overly long descriptions about a few different clients. I think they expect people to do in-app registration? Nobody wants to do that. I've already clicked the link somebody sent me.\n\nWay at the bottom is the \"just let me sign up\" link. It's totally backwards - you should just go straight into making an account, then get taken to a page with links to clients.\n\nGod and the clients. The only really good android clients are paid on Google Play. That alone is a deal breaker for a ton of people. You can get them for free from f-droid but again - normal people don't do that. \n\nConversations for Android is the nicest in terms of UX but I think it's fallen behind a but on features.\n\nMonocles is a conversations fork with some nice features but also tries to be social media with feeds and store and shit. And I think it does something with an optional telephone service? It's weird.\n\nThey all do this thing where logging in presents like 5 options. If you have a properly implemented server with the right DNS records, all you really need is a username/password field. The more options you give to a normal person the more they're going to find it confusing and just quit. \n\nIt should just be - you get an invite link. You make an account. Then you get linked to some apps and a decent web chat to get started right there.\n\nNobody is going to read multiple paragraphs just put out \"use this on Android, use this on iPhone\". The apps should just let you log in and not prompt you to sign up for weirdo phone service or give you this whole menu of \"I don't have an account and need one, I have an account, I'm a snikket user\"\n\nEven the whole \"use this app on iPhone, this app on Android, this app on macOS, this app on Windows\" really loses people. Regular people don't distinguish between a client and a service. It's all just \"discord\". \"Gmail\". \"Reddit\". You lose a lot of people when you say \"use conversions to connect to my XMPP server\".\n\nSnikket is trying to work on that a bit by just making everything \"snikket\". \n\nAnd then yeah, accounts. Try to figure out what to do when you forget your password.\n\nXMPP is great in a closed environment where you control the clients, have an external authentication system. But it is just absolutely terrible for regular people.",

I got frustrated and gave up.\n\nI've been looking into [https://www.rootapp.com/](https://www.rootapp.com/) and [https://fluxer.app/](https://fluxer.app/) but neither have easy self hosting options (give me a Dockerfile or docker-compose please) so haven't begun to dive into their actual code to implement Steam auth.\n\nI make games, and want my community to have a place to chat and screenshare. Ideally I'd like to theme it per game or have a unique \"server\" for each of my games, and I want to authenticate through Steam or any OpenID / OAuth provider.\n\nUltimately these chat apps aren't there *yet*",

          "text": "Yes. [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/) is free and open-source, easy to roll your own server [or rent](https://www.mumble.com/), and in my experience worked a little bit better than TeamSpeak or Ventrilo. I would always have this issue with the latter two where shit that me and my friends would say 5-10 minutes in the past would suddenly be rebroadcast to everyone, which was frustrating and really confusing especially when we were in the middle of some action. That never happened to me with Mumble.\n\nAlternatively, there's also the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) messaging protocol via applications like [Element](https://element.io/en). Matrix is a free, open-source, decentralized (you can use public Matrix servers like matrix.org or host your own server) and end-to-end encrypted rich text, video, and voice messaging protocol - while Element is arguably the most feature-complete and maturely developed of the available Matrix compatible client applications. It, too, is free and open-source, and is also easy-to-use, nice to look at, and works SIMILARLY to Discord. If you want to use it on your phone, be sure to pick up Element X over Element Classic, as Element X supports voice and video communication on mobile.\n\nI've migrated my entire Discord \"server\" over there, and recreated it as a Matrix \"space\" with \"rooms\" that correspond to my Discord channels - and by and large, it has worked exceptionally well. Discord IS pretty clearly a little more gamer-focused, so the screen-sharing features of Matrix, while they work quite well (and aren't resolution-limited without Nitro or a paid tier), aren't great for streaming and obviously you lack some of the more gamer-centric features (such as Discord's ability to tell your friends what game you're playing).",

TL;DR became a badge proudly worn by muppets instead of the admission of laziness and stupidity that it actually is.\n\nFolk started to lose the ability to write too - resulting in the crazy idea that an email subject line should match its content slowly drifting into ancient history. A similar thing happened in forums.\n\nWith rapidly diminishing ability remaining to deal with a matching 'Subject' and 'Content' pair - this also made dealing with forums quite tricky for most people - because who wants to deal with a bunch of posts titled:\n\n- help\n- need help\n- help me\n- stuck\n- it all went wrong when i did THIS\n\nIRC also started to struggle when many folk admitted that it was simply too hard to have to find and install an app, and then use multiple pieces of information to connect to a chat room\n\n- nick\n- server\n- port\n\nThis was simply not sustainable. Three pieces of information *and* an app!? No mere human can manage it without the assistance of 2 nearby nerds.\n\nSo now you have folk that can't read much, and can't write much - this pretty well killed the idea of a searchable FAQ - so instead of having a decent FAQ that newbies can read - we need to drag new users into a walled garden chatroom where most of them can ask the same question and get multiple similar but different answers from folk that want to feel important by having flair based on activity metrics.\n\nSo enter the chat providers - with their pretty interfaces and the idea that you can have your very own chat server^*\n\n...and information that should have been free on the internet could now be sponged up by these tech-leeches and sold back to you by surrounding it with adverts and 'boosts' or the like.\n\n^* ^by ^'very ^own' ^we ^mean ^'not ^yours ^at ^all. ^we ^just ^want ^to ^monetise ^you ^and ^your ^friends'",

An example of 'important feature' missing is there's no mechanism to prevent users from creating servers on your self hosted instance. There's a github issue for it and the dev basically said 'you can disable the server-create API endpoint on your reverse proxy, but given I'm 1 person doing most of the development I can't get to this right now'.

I run all my apps on my truenas machine from an ssd, but only have a limited amount of storage on the ssd, so would be nice to be able to offload content to my hard drives where I have plenty of storage.",

In that case it actually works great.\n\nBut yes, if you don't use the ESS but instead try to just use synapse (the back-end server) directly, installation and maintenance is indeed pain.

That \"I'm the odd one out\" impulse works both ways.\n\nEveryone thought Plex/Jellyfin was just for hyper-nerds and pirates because there was no way in hell people could convince their friends to connect to some sketchy website to watch ripped blurays.\n\nNow there's a Jellyfin client on just about every major device people use to watch movies and TV. I know tons of people who've never touched SSH or know what a seedbox is, yet they regularly watch stuff on Plex and/or Jellyfin servers from people they know.\n\n'cus, more often than not, a lot of people will passively have beef with Discord for one reason or another. If you stand up and say \"here is an alternative. I've already put in the effort of setting it up so all you have to do is *install a single app on your phone\"* then you have an incredibly high chance of talking people who actually speak a lot in the community into coming over.\n\nAnd if those people come over, you bring the tag-alongs who want to lurk in active communities.\n\nIt's a domino effect, it just requires one or two extroverts to be loudly and proudly into the alternative. I've been through friend groups leaving Skype for Teamspeak, leaving Teamspeak for Mumble, leaving Mumble for Razer Comms, leaving Razer Comms for Discord.

As far as closest feature set to Discord that has \"enough\" polish for Discord familiar users to use (including custom Emoji's), Mattermost checks most of the boxes, though not great if you need extended features like calls and such since even with self host you have to pay for. I don't need that but others have used Jitsi as an alternative or TeamSpeak I guess.\n\nI do like the interface on Matrix better in some cases, but just the pace of improvements (using Schildichat instead of stock Element btw) across the 10+ years I've been using it, the resource bloat, the foundation financial troubles, the crazy install procedures (yes even with the Ansible playbook), and the entire CSAM stuff on the main server, really put me off. Yes, there's a reason why Matrix is used by government agencies, but I'm just not comfortable with the idea of my server possibly being exploited as a distribution node for CSAM. It's unlikely, but I'm not taking that chance.\n\nSo for now, till these other self hosted options like Foscord and such become much more production ready, I'm settling on Mattermost for now. For larger servers, you may run into some limitations, but for my small needs, it's fine.\n\nI have also tried to like XMPP as an alternative, and even though the protocol is solid, the clients just aren't good enough.",

No central server that everything depends on.\n* **Decentralized** – accounts and communities are spread across many hosts, and clients verify everything locally. It's the most decentralized messenger ever created.\n* **Privacy** – end-to-end encryption (MLS in groups / communities), no PII, minimal metadata, and it can work in local/offline setups too.\n\nRight now I’m looking for people who care about self-hosting and decentralization and are willing to try it early, give feedback, or just say “keep going”. This thing is pretty hard to build and I honestly need support (any kind – even mental) and testers. Eventually it will be open-sourced, of course.\n\nWatch the full app demo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hExvh8m6r4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hExvh8m6r4)\n\nWe’re planning the first alpha next month.

But it's not so simple, because Discord, with all of their privacy violating garbage, does a lot under the hood that keeps users there.\n\nThe features I know that many users are looking for are:\n\n- Text channels with the ability to post images and links\n- Voice channels *that just work*\n- Ability to stream at 30 fps or better *that just works*\n- Using bots, both text and audio\n- Stickers\n- Animated emojis\n- Easy onboarding\n\nI know it sounds silly to list animated emojis as a major feature that users care about, but it needs to be said and emphasized. Users are *a lot* about stuff like that, as it lets them express themselves the way they want, and make their communities unique and feel special. If an open source or self-hosted alternative to Discord wants to bring in users, this is what it needs!\n\nThe most obvious candidate seems to be Matrix, but the last time I looked at it, it could do text channels with links and pics just fine. But that's about it. It didn't have the community customization features of Discord that users care about so much. It didn't have dedicated audio channels, and its nearest equivalent were voice calls more geared towards corporate environments and also didn't work out of the box -- I got weird errors that would be an instant turnoff for any non-tech savvy user. The onboarding process had enough friction to drive away a lot of users, which is probably the biggest problem with most of these federated apps.\n\nAlso, Matrix was *not* easy to self-host. It has *a ton* of moving parts, and updating it would frequently cause things to break with inscrutable database errors I had no idea how to fix. I might consider *paying* someone to host and manage Matrix for me, so that I don't have to deal with that, but that's going to be a non-starter for 99% of the communities out there.\n\nSo I'm curious what else is out there. I know that a replacement for Discord is asking a lot, and maybe the best way can do is a service that just has text channels. That would at least work for a lot of communities, but the easy to use voice chat / video chat / streaming / hangout spaces is a *big* part of why Discord won in this space.",

Looking at that library now, it seems to have improved significantly, so I may give that another shot. While I did my best to implement within the spec, I would also be more comfortable leveraging a \"battle-tested\" library than a bespoke implementation.\n\n\n> As an update on the status of this PR generally, I am considering closing this and splitting it further into pieces, in hopes that it will be more likely to be reviewed in a timely manner (and also easier for me to keep up-to-date). As part of that work, I may explore a new server implementation using such a library instead of a hand-rolled and likely flawed implementation.\n\n\nSo my best guess is we either see it this year, or in another 4 years with a solid shmaybe",

You are invited to call, text, or IM me asking for stuff. Alternatively, you can use this website.\" If someone makes a jellyseerr request, I have it configured to send a webhook to Home Assistant to instruct my color-changing bulbs to blink a specific pattern. My Philips hue bulbs bring me great joy from prior and them communicating to me there's a request is awesome. Connecting sonarr + radarr for automatic downloads is optional. I don't use this feature but the online userbase loves it\n\nIt is superb at looking at the history of requests. I have two annoying Plex users that make requests but then don't always watch them. I don't like that. When it happens, I want to know about it. It's a superb tool for saying \"hey why are you requesting so much and then not touching it?\" Seerr has a feature to make requests for other people. If one of my Plex users asks me for something offline, I add a jellyseerr request in his name to keep track of it. Super handy.\n\nSeerr is fantastic from existing as a catalog. Remember that time years ago the first time you discovered and interacted with Newegg's or mcmaster's online catalog? It's super organized as hell, is fast, and it feels like it genuinely wants to show you what you're asking. Jellyseerr is fantastic for all things movie and shows. The interface is better than all the online ones for interacting with movie and shows.\n\nIn conclusion, try it. Run it on a Raspberry Pi or a disposable virtual machine. Interact with it.

This often involved small python scripts, like authenticating to pihole or to [smart plug provider cloud] then use the api to toggle them without having to use their app, send confirmation messages to my phone, etc. That's a lot of wasted energy and cost.\n\nI gave CC my scripts for [my smart plug cloud provider] and authenticating to my local piholes and asked it to build me a personal dashboard that I could host on my old raspberry pi 3b. no gimmicks, no authentication, just hosting locally/with tailscale. Took two sessions, neither of which made me hit my session limit...I just got distracted the first day.",

I am pretty much entirely independend now, both with audiobook and ebook management. I can load up my devices on the go. Progress sync works perfectly. It's pretty fantastic.\n\nAnd also, the app itself (Plappa, wich is use on iOS) is very much superior to the Audible app.",

The tipping point for me was when I spent 15 minutes SSH'ing into 3 different servers to check why a service was slow, when a single glance at a dashboard would've shown the bottleneck instantly.\n\nWhat makes dashboards actually useful (vs vanity metrics):\n\n1. **Actionable alerts, not just graphs** - Don't just show CPU usage, show \"CPU >80% for 5+ minutes\" with a button to see which process. Context matters more than raw data.\n\n2. **Correlation over isolation** - Putting network I/O + disk I/O + response time on the same view reveals causation. Separate dashboards hide the relationships.\n\n3. **Historical comparison** - Being able to scroll back and see \"oh, this spike happens every Monday at 2am\" turns mysteries into patterns. Log retention + time-series data is the whole point.\n\n4. **Service dependencies** - A map showing which services talk to which, with health indicators, prevents the \"everything is red and I don't know where to start\" panic.\n\nThe key is treating dashboards as operational tools, not vanity projects. If you're not using it during an incident, it's probably not measuring the right things.\n\nWhat dashboard software did you end up settling on? I'm always curious what people find most useful for self-hosted setups.",

The frequency of the freezes increased over time. Obviously my first thought was, that the GPU is faulty and obviously I was wrong. \n\nThen the BSOD codes changed and did hint to a SSD problem which seemed likely given it was rather old. So swapped, reinstalled Windows and thought that was it. Of course I was wrong again, after a day I got the same errors. Changed RAMs, used a single bar in different slots, still nothing. Then I tried the PSU in another PC and used it a few hours, no freezes once again. \n\nAfter a lot of back and forth I gave up because I didn't need that PC anymore in this configuration and reused the PSU for another mainboard on a benchtable with totally different components and after about a day of useage, boom - same error, again hinting at the GPU drivers. Turns out that this specific PSU is known for instable rails under load. Apparently this caused the GPU driver to crash, which made Windows BSOD after some time but not immediately. Tested with reinstalling the OS on the first PC in it's original configuration and sure enough I had a day of peace until it started to crash every few minutes.\n\nSo yeah, you are right, power issues are hard to diagnose.",

I got a great deal on some double-conversion UPS's, love them much.\n\na normal UPS monitors the power coming from the wall and uses a relay to switch over to battery if there are problems detected with the power. it's all or nothing, it doesn't catch every small problem, and they don't work with non-inverter type generators. if you use a UPS with a generator, and it's not the inverter type generator, the AC frequency will change with the RPM of the motor, and the UPS will see this as a problem and just keep using battery.\n\na double-conversion UPS doesn't have that relay, and instead, it runs the inverter 24/7. this means they use a bit more power, but the electronics inside them are much better built. they take the AC power from the wall, convert it to DC, then convert it back to AC again with a clean and perfect voltage and frequency.\n\nI tried mine on a variac once, I found it doesn't switch over to battery until the power from the wall goes down to around 55 volts. it will happily take 60 volts from the wall at any frequency, boost it back up to 120 volts, and keep my equipment running safely. it's not free energy though. if I'm only giving it 60 volts, it will pull double the current from the wall so it still uses the same watts. they also work with basically any generator.",

My Brother laser printer, which only cost $75 in 2008 but has worked like a champ and survived four houses, three time zones, two kids, a university degree, and my entire career to date.\n\nLately however, its struggling. It won't hold a network connection for much longer than 15 minutes, and once it loses it, only a power cycle will bring it back online.\n\nI've tried everything. Wifi, ethernet, dedicated VLAN, static IP, DHCP changes, RTSP on, RTSP off, scripts to ping the printer every 5 minutes.\n\nA normal person would have bought a new printer. A sane person would just decide to turn the printer on when they need it.\n\n**I am apparently too stubborn to be a normal person**\n\nWhy would I spend money on a new printer when I have time I can waste on the problem instead? And why would I resign myself to walking across the room when I can build something to do it for me instead?\n\nSo I built a \"Legacy Hardware Integration Bridge\":\n\n- A CUPS print server running in a docker on my Unraid machine is now the \"printer\" for all my computers. The server stays always on, so the computers never see a \"Printer Offline\" error\n- When a print job hits the CUPS queue, it triggers a state change to a sensor entity on my Home Assistant server using the Internet Printer Protocol integration\n- The state change on that sensor acts as a trigger to an automation, which causes a smart plug to switch on\n- That smart plug is now controlling the power to the printer, so when it switches on, the printer boots up, and gets a fresh connection to the network\n- Once the printer has been idle for 5 minutes, it triggers the smart plug to turn off, and everything is ready for the next print job.\n\nMy wife thinks I could have just turned the printer on whenever I needed it and spent my Sunday doing something more productive.\n \nI'm not a caveman though. I have *technology*.",

I added a single Wyze V3 camera and it now has RTSP support in their official firmware. Have a couple newer Tapo cameras that I would recommend more-so. The hardware and wireless performance is much better (since it is a few years more recent LOL). There are used bargains out there that can reduce outlays, as many people swap in newer hardware all the time.\n\nBasically any if you go with RTSP cameras (incl. ONVIF support for pan/tilt etc.) there are a bunch of third-party solutions (like Frigate). If you can go wired ethernet/PoE route, that is the most robust setup.\n\nEven Unifi Protect now supports 3rd-party cameras, but Frigate \"roll-your-own\" integrated with Home Assistant seems very popular.",

          "text": "BueIris and Frigate are probably the two most commonly used software based NVRs.  BlueIris requires a small one time licensing fee and it comes with 12 months of updates.  If you want updates after that initial support period, you simply have to pay another small maintenance fee for another 12 months of updates.  The nice thing is that the original license is perpetual so the software works whether you decide to pay for any future maintenance plans or not.  Your paid maintenance time also does not need to be continuous, which means you can choose not pay the maintenance fee for years and then pay the fee and get 12 months of upgrades starting from the day you make the payment (not the day your support ended previously).  I haven't used Frigate, but BlueIris is 100% worth the cost IMHO.\n\nBoth will save your footage locally and the recommended network setup is to prevent your cameras from being able to access the \"internet\" at all.  There are several ways to accomplish this, but there is ZERO reason to allow you cameras access to the internet.\n\nIt's easy to set up remote access to your local network to view your cameras when you are not home, but that is outside the scope of this post.  It is also easy to make backups of your raw footage should you feel it necessary to do (normally it is not), but again that is outside the scope of this post.\n\nI run BlueIris in a VM on one of my Proxmox machines.  It works great and has all the benefits of other Proxmox VMs (backups, etc)",

Had a bunch of random ONVIF cameras stuck them in blue iris. \n\nBlue iris is ok and not incredibly expensive it looks and acts like dated software. It has some AI detection capabilities built in, but in my experience it needs a lot of setup and trial and error and configuration. It also only runs on Windows. \n\nFargate is more modern and free and has good home assistant integration. Also has AI detection built in but requires a lot of setup and configuration from scratch so there's a learning curve. \n\nUltimately I decided I was tired of tinkering and just wanted cameras and detection to work without constant monitoring and adjustments and went with Unifi. It's a bit costly upfront to get the cameras and NVR but in my experience it's a far better experience. Setup is easy, the cameras are great, detection always just works, and the app is great. I've got no complaints and wouldn't go back to either of the software. \n\nIf you're ok with a bigger upfront cost and want hassle free go with Unifi. If you don't want to spend and have cameras to use already you could go with Frigate if you're ok with learning and tinkering. If you want slightly less tinkering and ok with running a windows server, go with Blue Iris.",

They went so far as to tell me I was misleading in what I was showing is possible. It was very frustrating lol. \n\nThat said, I’m leaving the notifications about all “threat levels” on for the foreseeable future and testing some scenarios (I’m not joking when I say this, I’ll be heading out at about midnight one night holding a bat and pantomiming breaking into one of our cars while my face is covered just to see what happens lol). After I’ve really put everything through its paces I’ll be comfortable having alerts just for higher threat levels (but will leave Frigate to record any/all motion and objects…but it will reduce the mental bandwidth I need to dedicate to notifications).",

These models are trained locally on your machine using ImageNet via MobileNetV2.\n\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements\n\nObject classification models are lightweight and run very fast on CPU. Inference should be usable on virtually any machine that can run Frigate.\n\nTraining the model does briefly use a high amount of system resources for about 1–3 minutes per training run. On lower-power devices, training may take longer.\n\nA CPU with AVX instructions is required for training and inference.",

Then loaded alongside that model I’m running the 32B qwen3-vl model at the same time.  Both are initiated via llama-server (powered by llama.cpp) with their own flags/parameters.\n\nAs for why I don’t use use the same model for both, it’s because the less parameters the faster it runs. If I use the 32B model for my HA voice assistant it make take upwards of 10 seconds to do what I ask. Using the 8B model it takes less than 1.5 seconds. If I use a 4B model it’s less than a second, but the accuracy isn’t good enough for me. I’ve found the 8B to be the sweet spot between speed and accuracy. \n\nThen on the Frigate side of things, I value accuracy above all else, I don’t care if it takes 30-60 seconds to get the notification, I just want it to be accurate. ",

I didn't want to trust a random SaaS provider with my private goodbye messages or emergency credentials, so I decided to build my own solution.\n\nIt's called **Aeterna**. It's a simple self-hosted dead man's switch.\n\nThe idea is straightforward: You set a timer (3, 6, or 12 months). If you don't send a \"heartbeat\" to the system before the time runs out, it assumes you're \"offline\" for good and triggers:\n\n* **Emails:** Sends out those final messages you've prepared for family or friends.\n* **Webhooks:** Triggers whatever automation you need (shutting down servers, notifying services, etc.).\n\nI built it because I believe some messages should outlive us, but they should also stay under our own control until the very last moment.\n\n  \nIt’s open source, so I’d love to get your feedback on it!\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/alpyxn/aeterna](https://github.com/alpyxn/aeterna)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ajalnyw1p8jg1.png?width=1417&format=png&auto=webp&s=49dfd0269c3ea7a2dfbf2f3b6c20f28d0fe3c5dc\n\n  \n",

It has a lot of small issues that keep popping up, some of that is client specific, some is server, and some is protocol. Message read indicators are wonky, threads are inconvenient, notifications sometimes just disappear.... None of that is a big deterrent on its own, but it all adds up.\n\nThen there are the big issues. Sometimes the encryption can break and you're left unable to read people's messages. The only fix for that is waiting and hoping it fixes itself. Granted, I haven't had that happen in a while, but who knows if it's actually fixed or just pure luck.\n\nFrom the hosting perspective it's also a nightmare. I'll leave the server setup troubles, there's been plenty said about that. If you enable federation, your users can join a server that has illegal content, that gets cached on your server and suddenly you're hosting illegal materials. Or someone can make a private encrypted room which you as the owner can't moderate, and who knows what can go on in those.\n\nI'll be honest, I've been very optimistic about matrix 5 years ago when it was starting to get popular. But the same issues I've had then are still there, and instead of hearing about fixing those, I'm gearing about the devs getting into more and more dramas",

If you have a user which joins a naughty groupchat it will be mirrored to your server. I have no clue how to manage keys for users who are not tech savvy.\n\nIt's also a privacy nightmare since everything is mirrored in all locations. I'm quite sure it's actually a honeypot for intelligence agencies. The load on the server is also really high and gets ridiculous if you have a lot of federated users.\n\nIt's explained in detail here : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8KEuAEYjQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8KEuAEYjQ4)",

I literally have more than 50 open threads I cannot delete, and they come back / are restored when I reflashed even my Android device and installed a new or different client.\n\nI don't understand how the server and protocol implementation can be _this_ buggy. It's just a riddle to me how anybody can be fine with those types of bugs and not throw their smartphones out of the window.\n\nFor now my faith in matrix kinda died out, and I think something like an xmpp server would be more reasonable (if the clients fulfill OMEMO + XEPs for OTR stuff, which is a whole other story of compatibility issues) for most chat related things. If I need a voice chat with friends, I would host a mumble server (which is pretty close to what Teamspeak was at the time).\n\nContact management and contact discovery is also an issue on its own, because most chat clients assume you know all the handles / urls / identifiers which normal people actually never do if they want to contact you.\n\nBriar, for example, is unusable in practice because of that, because you effectively cannot discover contacts. Both contacts at the same time have to know each other's identifier that you have to have sent via third-party communication channel, and on top of that simultaneously have to do a handshake request; which effectively never works when people aren't standing exactly next to each other. Their NAT breaking techniques also never work in normal environments outside of carrier-grade NATs so most people always tell me that Briar never works because it silently fails to connect/discovery peers and contacts without any hint on why it didn't work.\n\nThe drama of revolt (aka stoat chat now until the next ADHD rebrand) is too much for me to get into right now, so I haven't tried that out yet. But from what I've heard it's pretty similar to Slack in how you use it.\n\nWhen thinking about the \"golden days\" of xmpp and jabber and gmail/facebook chat betas and the interoperability of chat clients like Trillian and Pidgin... man, it kinda went straight downhill from there.",

All the ingredients are there, and the initial goal for the project was always to provide a decentralised, secure, open platform where communities and organisations could communicate together. However, the reality is that the team at Element who originally created Matrix have had to focus on providing deployments for the public sector (see here or here) to be able to pay developers working on Matrix. **Some of the key features expected by Discord users have yet to be prioritised (game streaming, push-to-talk, voice channels, custom emoji, extensible presence, richer hierarchical moderation, etc).** Meanwhile no other organisation stepped up to focus on the “communication tool for communities” use case and provide a production ready Discord alternative, but clients like Cinny or Commet may feel much closer to Discord. On the other hand, Matrix goes far beyond Discord in other areas: both messages, files and calls are end-to-end-encrypted; we have read receipts; Matrix is an open protocol everyone can extend, and in the end, most Matrix clients are open source; there is nothing stopping developers from starting their own project based on existing ones and adding the missing features themselves. They may even eventually get accepted in the original projects!\n\nhttps://matrix.org/blog/2026/02/welcome-discord/",

TL;DR: Discord is not a single product in the eyes of users, it's used in *vastly* different ways. If you *just* use Discord for textchat, IRC is a perfectly reasonable replacement for Discord. But *lots* of people don't interact with Discord in that way.",

Been using this since half a year and will never look back.\n\nToday I looked at the [open PRs on Komodo's GitHub page](https://github.com/moghtech/komodo/pulls) and noticed somebody has opened like 50 PRs within two days tackling various open issues. All the PR descriptions are most likely AI generated (which is perfectly fine) but my assumption is that the code might also be entirely vibecoded given the short time frame of the contributions. I'm not a Rustacean at a professional level but how will we ever be able to ensure quality of FOSS projects if this turns out to be true?\n\nDon't want to step on somebody's toes, maybe there is a hooded guy with an insane amount of ambition and insider knowledge to the project and energy drinks in a darkened room with green characters flying across the display just like a Hollywood hacker movie scene who managed doing this one handed while playing the entire single player campaign mode of Age of Empires 2. If this is the case - all my respect is yours.\n\nEDIT: To all the \"AI is the future\"-people: I got you. Treating AI as a productivity tool is absolutely fine, I do it, you do it, most devs do nowadays. Sure, anyone can vibecode an app in a breeze today that plays music from somewhere. But there are limits when anyone thinks he can become a professional dev engineer without understanding what the software does and why it does it. Applications quickly reach a level of complexity where AI has its limits. Try conjuring up some professional business software from scratch with an LLM. Or peek at regulated markets, such as software in hospitals or aviation. Not to mention the DevOps who set up the infrastructure on which distributed systems run and scale.\n\nIt's us professionals who have to judge whether what comes out of LLMs is good, according to whatever standards. You don't let Gemini make trading decisions for you with full access to your broker. It's no different with programming. And no developer wants to read through pages of hallucinatory source code (here's my problem I wanted to spotlight with my original post implicating risks for the FOSS community) that might somehow does what it's supposed to do, if they have to find a small bug in there that cripples the entire system.\n\nI'm not worried about my job. On the contrary, I'm grateful for the new tools that make us more productive when we know how to use them properly. But a hammer stays a hammer and does not become a carpenter on its own.",

They were usually too large to review sensibly, with a lot of issues and feedback coming out of them. So recently, I've implemented a \"no vibe code\" contributor guideline, which seems to have calmed the submissions a bit. It even spawned a fully vibe-coded fork, which is fine as long as they follow the licence.\n\nIn my opinion, do what feels right for you. It's your project, your standards, and also because you're the one who needs to handle the fallout (issues/bugs) from those submissions. I am personally a lot stricter now, rejected a few, which has its downsides for contributors, but it does keep my project at the level of quality that I envision.",

Which means a massive transfer of work from non-maintainers to maintainers. Who are not known for having oodles of spare capacity.\n\nIn other words, vibe coding is a solution to the wrong problem, regardless of how fast it is.

There's no separate backend, Next.js API routes handle all the data fetching server-side. Each service (Proxmox, Portainer, Tautulli, Sonarr, Radarr, Unifi, etc.) has its own /api route that talks to the service's native API and returns normalized JSON. On the frontend, SWR handles data fetching with auto-refresh intervals.\n\nConfiguration: It's a mix. Service URLs, API keys and tokens.\n\nResources: Very lightweight. The Next.js app runs in a Docker container and sits around 80-100 MB RAM, basically no CPU unless you're loading a page.",

      "text": "Hey all, us again, in this post we just want to update y'all about some key changes that were deployed since our last post here:\n\n## Equipment Tab\n\nYou can now track the amount of distance put on certain equipment such as different tire sets, you can mark them as equipped and they will start accumulating mileage based on the odometer records.\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.lubelogger.com/Records/Equipment)\n\n[Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi6eqN2bKzk)\n\n## API Keys\n\nThe API used to only take basic auth which can be a security issue, so we have implemented API keys that can be passed in both via headers or as query parameters appended to the end of URLs. API keys also allow scoping, so you can create readonly API keys that cannot write data.\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.lubelogger.com/Advanced/API#api-keys)\n\n## Major UI Enhancement\n\nThe UI in LubeLogger is not great, especially on mobile, but we have made some big strides in improving the UI to hopefully make it a more bearable on small screens.\n\n[List of UI changes](https://hargata.github.io/hargata/lubelogger_159_ui_enhancement.pdf)\n\n## There are two versions released a day apart\n\nIf you head over to our GitHub repo right now, you might see that there are two versions(1.5.9 and 1.6.0) released a day apart.\n\n### What version should I upgrade to?\n\nIf you are already running a version of LubeLogger, upgrade to 1.5.9 if you want all of the enhancements listed above but are not in a position to troubleshoot potential breaking changes. The only difference is that 1.6.0 is pointed towards .NET 10 instead of 8 and the docker image is now Ubuntu and no longer Debian-based. There might be some breaking changes that stem from this depending on your set up.\n\n### What version should I install?\n\nIf this is your first time installing LubeLogger, go with the latest version which is 1.6.0 at the time of writing, as we don't plan on rolling back the .NET 10 migration.\n\n## No AI Statement(because it's not Friday)\n\nLubeLogger is not written with the assistance of AI, and is instead written by two very tired people in Eastern Utah. Some external PR's that we have received from third party contributors might have been AI-assisted(there's no way of knowing), but be rest-assured that the code has been thoroughly reviewed and tested before they're merged in.\n\n## Links\n\n[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hargata/lubelog)\n\n[Website](https://lubelogger.com)",

The equipment tracking, self‑hosting, or just not wanting your data on someone else’s server forever?\n\nIf you’re migrating a bunch of history, I’d export everything you can from Fuelly first and stash it somewhere safe before you start playing with LubeLogger. That way if you mess around with versions (1.5.9 vs 1.6.0) you’re not worried about losing anything.\n\nAlso, if you run it in Docker already, going straight to 1.6.0 is probably fine. If it’s on a tiny old box or some weird setup, 1.5.9 is the “sleep better tonight” choice.",

That plus self hosted makes this feel very “trustable” for nerds who don’t want their car history in some random SaaS.\n\nThe honest bit about .NET 10 vs 8 and telling existing users to stick to 1.5.9 if they don’t want to debug stuff is appreciated. Too many projects silently break people’s stacks in the name of “latest everything”.\n\nUI screenshots in the PDF look noticeably less cramped on mobile too.

Not really. But I do like the ideology behind the app. It's just not something that I'd consider an alternative to Discord. It just checks different boxes since for me Discord is used for voice calls and screensharing.\n\nFrontends for matrix are at differing levels of parity with the backend as well so it's just a challenge to be able to bring non-technical friends into the fold.",

If you’re setting up Spacebar and looking to self-host, make sure you’ve got a solid understanding of Docker or similar containerization tools, as these often simplify deployment. You’ll also want to ensure your server has the necessary resources and security measures in place, like a firewall and SSL certificates for secure connections. \n\nFor a reverse-engineered platform like this, keep an eye on updates from the developers, as alpha versions can be pretty fluid. If you run into specific issues, check out their GitHub repository for any open issues or documentation they might have. Good luck with your setup!",

Do you just accept the risk of \"getting caught\" or do you all run vpns and hope that VPN vendor will not cooperate with lawyers and government?",

That's civil law though, so generally you would be prosecuted by the copyright owner which is too costly for them for little gain for the average downloader. There is the potential of fines if it can be proven the owner has significantly lost money as a result of downloading. That's separate from someone profiting from downloads by distribution which is more serious.\n\nIn practice no one generally gets hauled into court, but there is a voluntary scheme with ISPs to scare downloaders by sending them threatening emails and letters courtesy of the copyright owner. A serial offender could be prosecuted.\n\nTorrents in particular can be trackable as big studios run their own fake seeds and harvest the IPs of the clients, then go to the ISPs.

High quality remuxes, high speeds. \n\nBut I recently open my jellyfin server to the family and they started to add all kind of niche content requests via jellyseer. And some are bot present on my private tracker. \n\nI tried to add public trackers but it is a jungle. Half of the files were exe or zips with an exe inside all kind of trash. I filtered all those but in the end I started to get low quality media labeled as 4k so I dropped the public trackers. \n\nSo I looked into Usenet but it looked oks expensive. Have to pay to get access to a provider the. You also need an indexer. For now I put this on hold but I would love to get back to it at some point.",

I think all in was around $130. \n\nTotally not necessary to have that many providers and indexers for your run of the mill content, one solid unlimited provider, one block provider, and an indexer or two are all you really need. So while ~$40-$60 upfront is a lot more than free, there’s no need to seed, download speeds are as fast as your ISP speed, and traffic is encrypted over SSL. I’ve downloaded like 30TB from usenet in the last 3 months without any fuss from my ISP and the quality of the content is exactly what I have set with the r apps. 10/10 recommend",

Getting caught and having to pay a potential fine of several thousend Euro is a risk i am not willing to take anymore. There are, in total, maybe 5 new Movies a year i really want to watch. If they are big enough i'll choose the cinema experience anyways. For everything else, i either wait for streaming or just buy the movie for 10-20€ depending on how long i want to wait.\n\nWhat i do now, i have bought a UHD Bluray drive for my PC that can properly rip 4k content. So for building my library i just buy the bluray (mostly used) and rip it to disc. Most Discs i keep, some i resell.

Now it could be anyone.\n\n\nBut ignoring the problem of pinpointing the specific person, there are also steps people can take to protect them self.\n\n\nThe main thing is to force all your network clients to use encrypted DNS. By doing this your ISP will no longer know which domains you visit.\nMultiple sites can be hosted on a single IP - so just knowing the IP you visit proves nothing.\nCombine that with encrypted traffic (https), and no one will be able to see what you are looking at on those IPs.\nIf you also stop using public trackers, then it significantly decreases the risk of content owners just downloading a torrent file and using the peer IP list to find you. \n\n\nWith a bit of luck and effort a content owner could of course get access to a private tracker and still get a list of peer IPs. But that still leaves the problem of pinpointing specifically who it was that downloaded the file.\n\n\nEven if they manage all that, they can only claim lost money.
