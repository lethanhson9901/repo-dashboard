If someone has less than the required number of parts, they have the equivalent amount of information as having 0 parts. This algorithm does not get weaker with quantum computers. \n\nThe algorithm is based on the idea for how you uniquely define a polynomial. \n\nIf you have 2 points on a line, you can find the equation for that line. You make the secret you’re trying to encrypt the Y value where X=0 for that equation and pick a random slope. Then, you give people points on the graph. You can give out as many points on the graph as you want, and no matter what, no one will be able to find the Y intercept unless they get 2 points. But any 2 points will find it. \n\nThis scales up. If you want 3 people to work together like OP, you use a quadratic equation. Now you need 3 points to uniquely define your equation. \n\nThere are additional steps in the actual algorithm to further obscure the values against other weaknesses, but this is how the core math works. \n\nExtremely clever algorithm. \n\nOp this is a perfect application of this algorithm, great work!",

That works out to be about $4.5 dollars per day since the first donation. A large portion of these donations have come from the last few weeks.\n\n  \nThis includes a mix of one-time donations (largest ever was $50) and monthly donations. Currently, I make about $35 month due to monthly recurring donations.\n\n  \nIt took about 6,000 GitHub stars before I received the first donation through GitHub Sponsors. Termix now sits at just over 10,000 for reference, with \\~4 million Docker pulls.\n\n  \nIn my case, there are no incentives to donate for any reason (no benefit other than a badge on your GitHub profile). The default and smallest donation amount that I have on my donation page is $1/month.\n\n  \nIn a few months (maybe a year), I'll do another post updating everyone who is curious!\n\n  \nThanks,  \nLuke",

I receive maybe 1 donation every 6 months and get about $3-$4 in ad revenue share per day, so $100/month or so. So ya, I feel ya. Overall, I am fine with it. I do it as a hobby because I enjoy it, not to replace my day job.\n\nI post this for context for people to understand that the vast majority of software out there like this that is free cannot in any way be sustainable. That's why I wasn't even surprised when I heard the TailwindCSS team got cut from 4 people to 1, and that they were dropping the few devs they had. The fact they even earned enough to afford even afford multiple developers, even with industry-wide popular software with nearly 100,000 stars on Github is pretty astonishing. At the end of the day, donation-based models just are not really sustainable. If you want to make an income over your free, open source, self-hosted app you create, you better have something that millions wants and then have a premium model people can purchase. The donation model does not work for 99% of devs. The only people making any money from donations is because of gifts from live streaming, or from extraordinarily popular Patreon exclusive projects people can subscribe to.\n\nI once setup a Patreon and got about $40/month in subs. The problem is the whole hassle of doing it all, trying to come up with exclusive stuff for Patreon, or just the weird vibe you now get from some people who sub $5 and now expect special treatment, wasn't really worth it to for me.",

Thought I'd share my experience and setup.\n\n**What I'm Running:**\n- Immich for photo backup (replacing Google Photos)\n- Navidrome for music streaming (replacing Spotify)\n- Jellyfin for movies/TV shows\n- Vaultwarden for password management\n- Paperless-ngx for document scanning\n- All running on a refurbished Dell Optiplex (i5-8500, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD + 8TB HDD)\n\n**The Good:**\n- Complete control over my data\n- No more subscription fees (saving ~$25/month)\n- Immich's face recognition is surprisingly good\n- Remote access via Tailscale works flawlessly\n\n**The Challenges:**\n- Initial setup took longer than expected (weekend project turned into 2 weeks)\n- Had to learn Docker and docker-compose from scratch\n- Backup strategy is still WIP\n- Wife needed some convincing about \"why can't we just use Google?\"\n\n**Unexpected Bonus:** The kids now watch our home videos on Jellyfin instead of YouTube!\n\nTotal cost so far: ~$400 (hardware) + time. Definitely worth it for the learning experience alone.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!",

(I opened an issue for this like 2 years ago and it keeps getting stale lol)\n\nAnd furthermore, the shuffle functions etc don't work well beyond the scope of one library, so either you get a bad mix of every kind of song in one library, or having to fragment your collection by language/genre etc.\n\nTLDR: subpar handling of id3 metadata.\n\nAny subsonic server like Gonic, etc paired with something like Symfonium is the best for music, imo. Jellyfin excels at video streaming but subpar for music.",

It handles indie releases surprisingly well since artists can submit their own metadata.\n\nHonestly the hardest part isn't finding music, it's the discovery side. Spotify's algorithm was the one thing I actually miss. I've been using last.fm scrobbling + listenbrainz to get recommendations, but it's not quite the same.",

It feels like they have an aggressive firewall with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) set up.\n\nThe Situation:\n\n• Blocked: Tailscale (VPNs don't connect), Cloudflare Tunnels (cannot reach my home lab), Steam/Games (connection timeouts), and even standard remote desktop tools often fail.\n\n• Allowed: Basic web browsing (HTTPS) works fine.\n\nWhat I'm trying to do:\n\nI have a home server (Linux machine) back at my parents' house that I want to access for remote dev work, and I also just want to be able to game occasionally.\n\nWhat I suspect:\n\nSince Tailscale and Cloudflare Tunnels are failing, I assume they are blocking UDP heavily and inspecting traffic signatures. Standard VPNs get flagged immediately.\n\nThe Question:\n\nHas anyone successfully bypassed a network this strict? I’m looking for \"hacky\" solutions or obfuscation techniques.\n\n• Would something like Shadowsocks or V2Ray wrapping the traffic in HTTPS work here?\n\n• Is there a way to tunnel UDP over TCP on port 443 effectively?\n\n• Any specific tools for bypassing DPI specifically for university networks?\n\nAny advice or keywords to research would be appreciated!",

Haproxy can do that. I did that like over 10 years ago to tunnel ssh wihtin TLS.’”\n\nUniversities often block tools like Tailscale (a WireGuard-based mesh VPN) and Cloudflare Tunneling (a secure outbound tunnel for exposing services without public IPs) to restrict unauthorized network access or self-hosted services. The suggested workaround disguises non-web traffic as standard HTTPS to evade firewalls, which rarely block TCP port 443 outbound.[reddit +3]\nKey Jargon Breakdown\n•\tVPN over TCP 443 of your VPS: Configure a VPN (like OpenVPN or WireGuard) to use TCP port 443 instead of UDP, routing through a Virtual Private Server (VPS). Firewalls allow this port for web traffic, bypassing VPN blocks.[ipfire +1]\n•\tSNI: Server Name Indication, a TLS extension where clients specify the target hostname during handshake. Proxies like HAProxy inspect SNI to route traffic without full decryption.[discourse.haproxy +1]\n•\tReverse proxy: A server (e.g., HAProxy) that forwards client requests to backends based on rules like SNI, hiding origins and multiplexing protocols on port 443.[stackoverflow]\n•\tHAProxy: Open-source load balancer/reverse proxy that supports TCP/TLS passthrough, SNI matching, and tunneling non-HTTPS like SSH inside TLS.[calomel +1]\n•\tTunnel SSH within TLS: Wrap SSH (port 22) traffic in TLS on port 443 using tools like HAProxy or stunnel, making it indistinguishable from HTTPS.[isaiahnullbyte.github +1]\nHow It Works\nOn your VPS, HAProxy listens on TCP 443, reads SNI from incoming TLS handshakes, and routes matching traffic (e.g., custom SNI for VPN/SSH) to internal services while passing normal HTTPS elsewhere. Clients connect via tools like `openssl s_client` as a ProxyCommand in SSH config to initiate the tunneled connection. This has bypassed restrictive networks like universities for years by mimicking web traffic.[haproxy +3]",

So the easy way to shut down DPI is to uninstall the college's root certificate from your system.\n\nThey can monitor DNS if you're not using DOT/DOH/DOQ, so make sure to use encrypted DNS, ideally DOH, which is hardest to block.  They can block known VPN providers and servers by IP address and ASN.  They can block the ports commonly associated with VPN (such as TCP 22 for ssh, UDP 1194 for OpenVPN, UDP 51820 for Wireguard, UDP 500, 4500, 4510 & 4511 for IPSec).  They might even block *everything* except TCP 80 & 443 for web browsing (but that would cause many things to break, including YouTube).\n\nWhat this leaves is setting up an ssh tunnel to a home system via TCP 443, or setting up an SSL-VPN such as SoftEther.  But this doesn't guarantee that your college's network team won't detect the VPN.  Standard web browser behavior is to open a connection, transfer a page of data, then close the connection.  So for browsing, the connection only usually stays open for a few seconds or minutes and downloads a few hundred to a few thousand bytes per connection, with delays in between while you read that page of data.  With a VPN the connection will stay open for minutes or hours with a constantly increasing amount of data transferred in both directions.  It's very easy for the network team to see the difference and shut down access to the offending remote IP.",

Makes SSH traffic look like regular HTTPS to DPI.\n\nFor the VPS cost concern - Oracle Cloud free tier gives you 2 ARM machines + 200GB storage forever. Not powerful but enough for SSH tunneling. Hetzner has cheap options too (\\~€3-4/mo).\n\nBe careful gaming through tunnel tho - TCP-over-TCP has bad latency characteristics. Better to split use cases: SSH for dev work, maybe accept lag for games or use cloud gaming service instead.",

That spits out JSON files that Glance treats as a Custom API.  For those, Glance only ever sees the JSONs.\n\n\\- For the Arcade games, my arcade cab runs EmulationStation-DE as the frontend.  When I start a game, ES-DE runs a script that adds that game to a JSON file which is accessible by Glance.  That populates the \"Last Played Arcade\" section.\n\n\\- For the arcade high scores, I have a button combo on my arcade cab that sends a screenshot to a shared network folder.  I have a locally-run PHP webapp (more AI slop) that looks for new screenshots, and lets me manually tag them and generate another JSON for Glance (and my High Scores webpage).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osf6515wpohg1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=29fa7d6e54018945085f523d7add74dd5854e6cf\n\n  \n\\- For the \"Currently Playing Games\" & \"Recently Finished Games\", I have a scraper setup in Docker. It goes out a couple times a day and pulls the corresponding Shared Widgets (info & example for the widgets is at the bottom of [Grouvee's help page](https://www.grouvee.com/help/)) from [my Grouvee games tracker](https://www.grouvee.com/user/73634-RxBrad/shelves/381115-played/).  Then a script converts that widget into JSON for Glance to use.  Again, this is more AI slop which I assume nobody actually wants shared.",

I went looking for a solution and found it in Home Assistant. \n\nI set that up in a VMware Workstation VM to tinker on my desktop PC and ran it that way for a while, and now from there I have a SFF PC (Dell Wyse 5070) that is running Proxmox and is a 24/7 server for Home Assistant, pihole, and recently Jellyfin. \n\nI still have plenty to learn especially about Proxmox but the days I’ve spent typing commands and using AI to help has taught me some things. My next steps are upgrading the RAM to 16gb and a 256gb m.2 SSD because it only came with a 64gb m.2 SSD and I barely have any space left. Once I get those upgrades I plan to set up Immich and see how that works.",

At minimum back up your Jellyfin config, *arr configs, and whatever you’re using for auth. Even just a tar of the config folders to that 8 TB drive on a cron is already a win.\n\nWatch your drive spin-down settings with that external. Some USB externals love to sleep aggressively, which can cause stutters in Jellyfin. You can tweak hdparm or vendor tools, or move “cold” stuff to that disk and keep frequently watched stuff on the NVMe.\n\nSince you’re on Tailscale, you can skip exposing ports to the internet and just use that as your “remote access” layer. Much safer while you’re still learning.\n\nIf you get bored and want to add “internal tools” later, that little HP box is also perfect for running stuff like a small dashboard, admin panel for your DB, etc. Things like Retool / Appsmith / UI Bakery style tools can sit in Docker too so you can poke at your data without giving yourself direct DB access all the time.\n\nOtherwise you’re on a solid path. Biggest tip: change one thing at a time, and keep a simple text file with what you did, so future you can undo the chaos.",

They take up less space, draw less power, and you won’t outgrow them as quickly.\n\nAlso, keep an eye on the USB connection. A couple of my external drive enclosures died on me, and I thought the drives were toast. Turned out it was just the USB cases. If one of your drives disappears or isn’t being detected, remove the  external USB enclosure and try directly / buy another external USB enclosure   \n\n\nPS: Always keep a 3-2-1 backup of anything you actually care about.  \nTry not to leave your external drive perched right on the edge of the table. it only takes one drop ... (maybe not one small drop but safer than sorry)",

However I'm currently a bit irritated by the Library analysis you're doing - the numbers of movies / TV Show Episodes I have don't really match with any of the statistics I have in Emby itself (only connected Emby so far), and really a bit unsure what it counts as an episode and what as a movie, considering that there are library types like \"mixed content\". \n\nIf I might make a sugguestion, grab all libraries from the server and track the statistics (growth, number of elements, size) for each of them seperately, which will also make it easier to monitor where changes are happening.\n\nAnd if I may add something else - Audiobookshelf would also be a very easy match for what you are doing as a supported server platform.",

It bridges the gap between the \"set it and forget it\" crowd and the data nerds who want to know exactly what’s happening under the hood at all times. Highly recommend giving it a spin...

If you want your adguard/pihole pod to have a LAN IP address there's ways to do that in k8s (look up multus CNI). I currently have both Adguard and Homeassistant running in my cluster, but both pods have a 192.168.1.x address in addition to their cluster addresses, meaning they're fully addressable by other devices on the network.\n\nIf you care a lot about home automation another potential project could be setting up IPv6, which is required for Thread networking.",

Don't quote me on this but if you want to use this with a NAS you may need to look into how file changes are detected and potentially do frequent manual or event-driven scans (using your own script).\n\nIn general setting up clamav is just installing it via a package manager, enabling the service/daemon via e.g. systemctl, and then configuring it via the settings file. You probably also want to add some manual scanning as a cronjob. However, it has no built-in actions per se. I personally have it ping me via notify and use a system I set up to include a button to a temporary webhook endpoint to delete the flagged file if I choose, but I haven't ever had to use it, just tested with test signatures. And personally I wouldn't want it to automatically delete things as false positives are common, but if you want a sensible automatic mitigation you could set permissions for all such files to be inaccessible to all but root and not executable.",

In short, the official builds are under MIT and you can create your own builds under the AGPL. But nowhere do they state what license the code is released under. You can kinda infer that they mean AGPL, but some uncertainty remains, and that opens you up to legal trouble.\n\nAn [issue](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/issues/8886#issuecomment-3837091846) was opened about this 7 years ago. After doing nothing for all this time, they've finally went ahead and closed it\n\n>Thank you for the community discussion around this topic. I do recognize that our licensing strategy doesn't offer the clarity the community would like to see, but at this time we are not entertaining any changes as such.\n\nThis is a big fuck you to the open source community. Mattermost is advertised as open source and they have hundreds of dependencies they build upon. Totally unacceptable behavior in my book.",

Very similar to my setup so I have a question because I don't often see Fritzbox routers here:\n\nFritzbox routers (at least my model 7690) has  this NAT problem where you cannot see the network if you are on the network and in the VPN. Its called NAT loopback or NAT hairpin. \n\nThis is the scenario: I am in the city, so I connect to Wireguard because I want to access an internal page, I get home later and the VPN client is still up on my mobile, when I am on the local network, the VPN client ends up blocking all traffic to and from my mobile because it does not know how to handle the NAT when you are with a local address, accessing the public address.\n\nI tried to explain this to Fritzbox support and they didn't know what NAT was, so I gave up with them. Its crazy how somebody can just pretend they have no idea what you are talking about so they can close the ticket as \"delusional customer\" or something like this.\n\nDo you have this problem and are you able to work around it?\n\nMy homelab: In my network, as above but I have a old I5-46xxK processor in an old PC, instead of a Pi. This particular i5 processor support QSV, so I chose it because it can transcode quite well and uses low amount of power when idle. I love the Pi5, have had many Pis in my life, but this PC, although old (DDR3) is really low powered, 32GB RAM and runs Windows Server because I find the block deduplication easy to setup, reliable and efficient. I have a second old PC I use for running docker, Ollama, etc. for my application stack.\n\nEdited to add: I work in a datacenter for a living so from my experience, RAID, anywhere except on RAID specific hardware, in a datacenter, is a bad move. I prefer to have the disks all as stand-alone but I sync my precious folders to multiple devices. This gives me the advantage of lower power, redundant copies and I get to use all the rest of the disk space which would otherwise be used by the RAID.",

I have only used it for a couple of days, but so far it worked very well for me.\n\nThe app is Android only, but I believe the iOS app has this functionality built in.",

The person who brought you Dockge, Uptime Kuma, RDP Portal.\n\nSometimes you see someone who has the ability to distill usefulness into a pure gold. Louis Lam does this.\n\nSo, no promotion, no AI, no requests for \"what should I do now that I have a server?\", just some appreciation for one of the Rock Stars of the SH/OSS community.\n\nThanks Louis!\n\n[https://github.com/louislam](https://github.com/louislam)",

I personally need something, but I cannot find any free/open-source solution, so I build it for myself, and then share it with you guys.\n\nIt is also a good chance to try new tech/libraries on new projects. For example, It's MyTabs, it was my first time using `better-auth` for auth. And wow! It is amazing. It is easy-to-use and the most powerful auth library that I have ever used.\n\nAlso there are actually many hidden heroes behind the scene. For example, It's MyTabs is using a Score/Tab engine called AlphaTab to render guitar pro files. If no one made this engine, my project would not be possible in the first place.",

I went from rarely hitting a 1.0 ratio on any torrents to capping out at my global ratio limit of 10.0 on most torrents.\n\nI also have a global sharing time limit enabled - torrents complete automatically after a month, regardless of whether they hit my sharing limit or not. I only use public trackers though, ymmv if you use private trackers with more specific seeding requirements.",

If you add the UI it becomes a slippery slope, users will start expecting EVERYTHING to be editable via the UI and the project maintainer will most definitely take this into consideration.\n\nBy all means please DO try and open a pull request once you're confident with your codebase and functionality but I'm leveling your expectations here. I may be wrong btw, I'm just giving you my 2 cent from the dev side of things. \n\nThis is regardless very cool and if they don't accept it I'd create it as a browser extension and work in tandem with homepage, open source it and make this its own product/tool as an enhancement feature <3",

Think Overseerr/Jellyseerr + Radarr/Sonarr, but purpose-built for\n  audiobooks. Request a book, and it handles the rest: searches indexers, downloads, organizes files, and triggers a library scan. Done.\n\n## What it does:\n\n  - Plex and Audiobookshelf support (your choice)\n  - Torrents via qBittorrent + Usenet via SABnzbd\n  - Prowlarr for indexer search (torrents + NZBs)\n  - One-click requests with full automation pipeline\n  - Chapter merging - multi-file downloads automatically merged into a single M4B with chapters\n  - E-book sidecar - optional EBook downloads alongside your audiobooks (And file repair for kindle import)\n  - BookDate - AI-powered audiobook recommendations with a Tinder-style swipe interface (OpenAI/Claude/Local)\n  - Request approval workflows for multi-user setups\n  - OIDC authentication support (Authentik, Keycloak, etc.)\n  - Step-by-step setup wizard with connection testing\n  - Single Docker container - just docker compose up -d and go\n\n## Screenshots:\n\n  https://imgur.com/a/2nHmVSk\n\n## What's changed since the beta posts:\n\n  A lot. Usenet support, Audiobookshelf integration, OIDC auth, e-book downloads, chapter merging, admin approval workflows, notification support (Discord/Pushover), and honestly too many\n  fixes and improvements to list. The beta testers put this thing through hell and it's significantly better for it.\n\n## Thank you to the beta community:\n\n  Genuinely - this release wouldn't be what it is without the people who jumped in early, broke things, reported bugs, and gave feedback. You all shaped this project in ways I couldn't have on\n   my own. Thank you.\n\n## Get involved:\n\n  GitHub: https://github.com/kikootwo/readmeabook\n\n  Discord: https://discord.gg/kaw6jKbKts\n\n  The repo is public and contributions are welcome. Whether it's features, bug fixes, or documentation - if you want to get involved, the Discord is the best place to start. It's also where\n  you'll find setup help and general discussion.\n\n## Tech details:\n\n  - Stack: Next.js, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis\n  - Deployment: Single Docker container (embedded PostgreSQL/Redis)\n  - Auth: Plex OAuth, Audiobookshelf OIDC, Local Registration\n  - Integrations: Plex, Audiobookshelf, Prowlarr, qBittorrent, SABnzbd\n  - License: AGPL v3\n\n\n---\n  If you've ever been frustrated trying to get audiobook automation working with tools that weren't built for it, come give this a shot. And if you're not ready to self-host yet, come hang out in the Discord anyway - would love to hear what you'd want from a tool like this.",

Looking at «docker-compose.debug.yml», the app already accepts DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL as environment variables, which is great.\n\nHowever, building a custom image is a bit of a barrier for what's otherwise a very smooth deployment experience. Would you consider having the unified image check for these env vars at startup and skip launching the internal Postgres/Redis when they're provided? This is a pretty common pattern in similar self-hosted apps. Immich, Baserow, and others do exactly this, letting users point at external databases without needing a separate image.\n\nSince Prisma already reads DATABASE_URL natively, the main change would just be conditional logic in the entrypoint to skip the internal service startup.",

              "text": "Thank you. As for the architecture, I have to make it clear that access control in Octelium is done on a per-resource, per-request basis, and trust is NOT network-scoped whatsoever. In fact, per-resource AND per-request access control is probably the primary rationale behind the entire architecture used in Octelium when compared to remote access VPNs and other remote access tools and gateways. Maybe the confusion is coming from having a VPN-like \\`octelium connect\\` command in the client-based access mode; however, Octelium's architecture is very different from VPNs, since every request, which is transported over WireGuard/QUIC in the client-based mode and HTTPS+short-lived access token for the clientless mode, is intercepted by an identity-aware proxy in the Cluster, which is running on top of a k8s cluster, that  does authentication/L7-aware authorization via policy-as-code/dynamic routing/visibility and auditing on a per-request basis. Simply every single resource/application that needs to be protected by the Cluster is represented by a Service that's implemented by a L7-aware identity-aware proxy in the Cluster itself, and that identity-aware proxy intercepts every single requests from users to the corresponding protected resource/upstream. In short, \\`octelium connect\\` does not guarantee that you have access to any Service whatsoever unless explicitly set by a CEL/OPA Policy (read more here https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/core/policy) and such Policies can be attached to specific Users, Groups, Sessions, Devices, Services or Service Namespaces. Users simply never have direct access to the protected resources and instead every single request has to be authenticated, authorized and audited by the identity-aware proxy sitting between the user and the corresponding protected resource. You can read more about Octelium's architecture in detail if you are interested [https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/overview/how-octelium-works](https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/overview/how-octelium-works)\n\nAlso, as for the \"non-routability\" issue, while Octelium supports access to internal resources of any type behind NAT like any VPN, I don't think that NIST 800-207 says anything regarding having security through obscurity, in fact, I'd argue that the standard clearly advocates for unification of identity-based access control at the resource level on a per-request basis whether it be via private/client-based mode or via the clientless public mode. The latter case is the whole rationale behind the BeyondCorp architecture championed by Google. In other words, if you could do true identity-based access control at the resource level on a per-request basis, i.e. true zero trust, then it doesn't matter whether the resource is publicly exposed on the internet via an identity-aware proxy or is behind NAT, since the same exact access control mechanism is applied in either case.",

                  "text": "Thanks for the clarification... I think we’re actually closer than it might appear.\n\nI agree that per-resource, per-request authorization at L7 is foundational to Zero Trust, and your proxy-centric model clearly enforces that well. Where I’m drawing the distinction isn’t whether requests are authorized per-request (we agree there), but whether network reachability still exists as a prerequisite.\n\nIn proxy / gateway–based ZTNA models (including BeyondCorp-style), identity and policy are enforced after a resource is reachable... even if that reachability is brokered via NAT, tunnels, or an identity-aware gateway. This works well for many L7 use cases, but it still means a routable address space exists and must be mediated.\n\nThat structural choice is exactly the point raised in [Google’s BeyondCorp essay on the long tail of Zero Trust](https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/beyondcorp-and-long-tail-zero-trust), some protocols and application patterns don’t naturally fit a request/response proxy model (legacy protocols, interactive sessions, UDP/peer models, etc.). In those cases the proxy must terminate and re-originate, adapt semantics, or impose its own constraints, which becomes an application compatibility tradeoff rather than a flaw per se.\n\nIdentity-first overlays take a different approach: there is no routable network plane at all. Identity and policy don’t just authorize traffic - they create the service path itself, per service and per session. If a service isn’t authorized, there is no IP, no port, no listener, and nothing to proxy or scan.\n\nSo the distinction isn’t “per-request vs not,” but:\n\n* Authorize traffic to reachable resources (proxy / ZTNA model)\n* Eliminate reachability and create connectivity only by policy (identity-first model)\n\nBoth fit within NIST 800-207’s Zero Trust architecture, but they make different tradeoffs around exposure, blast radius, protocol compatibility, and operational model, especially as you move beyond HTTP and cloud-native workloads.",

And since Octelium runs on top of Kubernetes, you can further use it to self-host an identity provider (e.g. Keycloak, Authentik, etc.) as shown in the docs here [https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/homelab/keycloak-helm-self-host](https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/homelab/keycloak-helm-self-host) and [https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/homelab/authentik-helm-self-host](https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/homelab/authentik-helm-self-host) ",

In short, I believe Octelium is much more advanced but flexible overall, and it's more comparable to Cloudflare Access or Teleport in terms of architecture.

          "text": "Wow, that is a lot to take in. I'm reading and learning a lot from the docs. Since you're solo building this, I am also curious about your roadmap and interests:\n\n1. What's the value add of QUIC support? I am not familiar with it. Looks like it's an improvement against Wireguard censorship?\n\n2. I've been using the ingress controller [Contour](https://projectcontour.io/about/) for many years, and am still using their CRD [projectcontour.io/v1/HTTPProxy](https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.33/config/fundamentals/) for defining ingress. I've thought about moving to the newer Gateway CRDs, but it looks like Octelium also has its own Envoy wrapper and resource definitions for Service so that it can add CEL expressions evaluated by Vigil/Octovigil. Can you clarify the boundary between what Octelium is providing vs what other ingress controllers may provide? Maybe I also have the wrong impression, but I see a lot of common resource names at https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/reference/resources without a link to the specific specs. These are all unrelated to k8s, but just look similar to k8s?\n\n3. I see User and Group resources and using these as part of CEL expressions on the service resource. That seems like it would be very difficult as you grow on the platform. I have been using FreeIPA for awhile, so I'm just curious how something like groups defined in LDAP might work with policy expressions: https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/core/policy. There are some examples with `ctx` but I am still not clear. Do I have to use the group resources?\n\nI guess what I kind of miss is an IDL spec where it just says exactly what the grammar is for these things.\n\nStill, all very interesting. Will definitely keep researching. Thanks!",

              "text": "1. Octelium does support both WireGuard and QUIC tunneling. WireGuard is currently the default mode. As for why QUIC is added, for a few reasons, among which is FIPS-140 compliance, obfuscation since QUIC traffic is simply HTTP3 traffic when inspected by middleboxes, and I honestly believe in QUIC's superiority long term (e.g. AES hardware acceleration, congestion control, good implementations by most top programming languages, etc..). \n\n2. Octelium can indeed operate as a Kubernetes ingress, I'd say a much more advanced and dynamic one, compared to strict K8s ingress controllers using the, I'd say, K8s very primitive Ingress resources. For example, you can dynamically route based request paths, query arguments, even serialized JSON body if you want to, you can manipulate requests and responses including body with Lua scripts and Envoy ext\\_proc. However, you need to know that Octelium comes with its own separate Envoy-based ingress and it has nothing to do with the Kubernetes canonical \"Ingress\" resources, yet Octelium can co-exist with any k8s ingress controller running on the same cluster. Simply Octelium doesn't care about your k8s ingress at all. You need to use Octelium and its own resources to achieve that K8s ingress functionality. Also note that Octelium's resources are not wrappers around k8s CRDs, Octelium has its own resources stored in its own separate postgres database. Again, Octelium resources are NOT k8s CRDs.\n\n3. \\`ctx\\` just means \"context\". It's basically the \"request context\" map that wraps all the request context, including all info about the User, Session, Device if exists, all User's Groups if any, the accessed Service and its Namespace, as well as the request's layer-7 info (e.g. HTTP request path, method, headers, etc..). The docs are full of examples on how to write Policy rules (check out the User, Service pages and the example guides such as [https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/ai/ai-gateway#access-control](https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/ai/ai-gateway#access-control) and [https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/ai/self-hosted-mcp#access-control](https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/ai/self-hosted-mcp#access-control) and https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/http/api-gateway#access-control), but this [https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/core/policy](https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/core/policy) should be your main reference.\n\n",

For example `ctx.user.spec.groups` in the first example, I am guessing is a check across the Octelium Group resources. But does this also include from an IdentitiyProvider backend? For example will the context object also include Keycloak groups (that in my case would be synced from FreeIPA LDAP)? I am guessing no based on a quick read of https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/core/identity-providers which means I need to replicate my groups to Octelium configs.",
