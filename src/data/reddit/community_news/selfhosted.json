      "text": "Today, after raising security concerns in a post on r/huntarr regarding the lack of development standards in what looks like a 100% vibe-coded project, I was banned. This made my spidey senses tingle, so I decided to do a security review of the codebase. What I found was... not good. TLDR: If you have Huntarr exposed on your stack, anyone can pull your API keys for Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, and every other connected app without logging in, gaining full control over your media stack.\n\n# The process\n\nI did a security review of Huntarr.io (v9.4.2) and found critical auth bypass vulnerabilities. I'm posting this here because Huntarr sits on top of (and is now trying to replace them as well!) Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, and other *arr apps that have years of security hardening behind them. If you install Huntarr, you're adding an app with zero authentication on its most sensitive endpoints, and that punches a hole through whatever network security you've set up for the rest of your stack.\n\n**The worst one:** `POST /api/settings/general` requires no login, no session, no API key. Nothing. Anyone who can reach your Huntarr instance can rewrite your entire configuration and the response comes back with **every setting for every integrated application** in cleartext. Not just Huntarr's own proxy credentials - the response includes API keys and instance URLs for Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Lidarr, Readarr, Whisparr, and every other connected app. One curl command and an attacker has direct API access to your entire media stack:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST http://your-huntarr:9705/api/settings/general \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"proxy_enabled\": true}'\n```\n\nFull config dump with passwords and API keys for every connected application. If your instance is internet-facing - and it often is, Huntarr incorporates features like Requestarr designed for external access - anyone on the internet can pull your credentials without logging in.\n\n**Other findings (21 total across critical/high/medium):**\n\n- **Unauthenticated 2FA enrollment on the owner account** (Critical, **proven in CI**): `POST /api/user/2fa/setup` with no session returned the actual TOTP secret and QR code for the owner account. An attacker generates a code, calls `/api/user/2fa/verify`, enrolls their own authenticator. Full account takeover, no password needed.\n- **Unauthenticated setup clear enables full account takeover** (Critical, **proven in CI**): `POST /api/setup/clear` requires no auth. Returns 200 \"Setup progress cleared.\" An attacker re-arms the setup flow, creates a new owner account, replaces the legitimate owner entirely.\n- **Unauthenticated recovery key generation** (Critical, **proven in CI**): `POST /auth/recovery-key/generate` with `{\"setup_mode\": true}` reaches business logic with no auth check (returns 400, not 401/403). The endpoint is unauthenticated.\n- **Full cross-app credential exposure** (Critical, **proven in CI**): Writing a single setting returns configuration for 10+ integrated apps. One call, your entire stack's API keys.\n- **Unauthenticated Plex account unlink** - anyone can disconnect your Plex from Huntarr\n- **Auth bypass on Plex account linking** via client-controlled `setup_mode` flag - the server skips session checks if you send `{\"setup_mode\": true}`\n- **Zip Slip arbitrary file write** (High): `zipfile.extractall()` on user-uploaded ZIPs without filename sanitization. The container runs as root.\n- **Path traversal in backup restore/delete** (High): `backup_id` from user input goes straight into filesystem paths. `shutil.rmtree()` makes it a directory deletion primitive.\n- `local_access_bypass` trusts `X-Forwarded-For` headers, which are trivially spoofable - combine with the unauth settings write and you get full access to protected endpoints\n\n**How I found this:** Basic code review and standard automated tools (bandit, pip-audit). The kind of stuff any maintainer should be running. The auth bypass isn't a subtle bug - `auth.py` has an explicit whitelist that skips auth for `/api/settings/general`. It's just not there.\n\n**About the maintainer and the codebase:**\n\nThe maintainer [says](https://i.imgur.com/sjPAT1u.png) they have \"a series of steering documents I generated that does cybersecurity checks and provides additional hardening\" and **\"Note I also work in cybersecurity.\"** They [say](https://i.imgur.com/8AkHZ27.png) they've put in \"120+ hours in the last 4 weeks\" using \"steering documents to advise along the way from cybersecurity, to hardening, and standards\". If that's true, it's not showing in the code.\n\nIf you work in cybersecurity, you should know not to whitelist your most sensitive endpoint as unauthenticated. You should know that returning TOTP secrets to unauthenticated callers is account takeover. You should know `zipfile.extractall()` on untrusted input is textbook Zip Slip. This is introductory stuff. The \"cybersecurity steering documents\" aren't catching what a basic security scan flags in seconds.\n\nLook at the [commit history](https://i.imgur.com/TomsJz0.png): dozens of commits with messages like \"Update\", \"update\", \"Patch\", \"change\", \"Bug Patch\" - hundreds of changed files in commits separated by a few minutes. No PR process, no code review, no second pair of eyes - just raw trunk-based development where 50 features get pushed in a day with zero review. Normal OSS projects are slower for a reason: multiple people look at changes before they go in. Huntarr has none of that.\n\nWhen [called out on this](https://i.imgur.com/dF0Oyst.png), the maintainer said budget constraints: \"With a limited budget, you can only go so far unless you want to spend $1000+. I allot $40 a month in the heaviest of tasks.\" That's just not true - you can use AI-assisted development 8 hours a day for $20/month. The real problem isn't the budget. It's that the maintainer doesn't understand the security architecture they're building and doesn't understand the tools they're using to build it. You can't guide an AI to implement auth if you don't recognize what's wrong when it doesn't.\n\n**They also censor security reports and ban people who raise concerns.** A user posted security concerns on r/huntarr and it was [removed by the moderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/huntarr/comments/1rbtri7/removed_by_moderator/) - the maintainer controls the subreddit. I was banned from r/huntarr after pointing out these issues in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/huntarr/comments/1rccfcd/huntarr_94_released_user_requests_bundling/) where the maintainer was claiming to work in cybersecurity (which they now deleted).\n\nOne more thing - the project's README has a \"Support - Building My Daughter's Future\" section soliciting donations. That's a red flag for me. You're asking people to fund your development while shipping code with 21 unpatched security vulnerabilities, no code review process, and banning people who point out the problems, while doing an appeal to emotion about your daughter. If you need money, that's fine - but you should be transparent about what you're spending it on and you should be shipping code that doesn't put your users at risk.\n\n**Proof repo with automated CI:** https://github.com/rfsbraz/huntarr-security-review\n\nDocker Compose setup that pulls the published Huntarr image and runs a Python script proving each vulnerability. GitHub Actions runs it on every push - check the workflow results yourself or run it locally with `docker compose up -d && python3 scripts/prove_vulns.py`.\n\nFor what it's worth, and to prove I'm not an AI hater, the `prove_vulns` script itself was vibe coded - I identified the vulnerabilities through code review, wrote up the repro steps, and had AI generate the proof script.\n\nFull security review (21 findings): https://github.com/rfsbraz/huntarr-security-review/blob/main/Huntarr.io_SECURITY_REVIEW.md\n\n**What happens next:** The maintainer will most likely prompt these problems away - feed the findings to an AI and ship a patch. But fixing 21 specific findings doesn't fix the process that created them. No code review, no PR process, no automated testing, no one who understands security reviewing what ships. The next batch of features will have the next batch of vulnerabilities. This is only the start. If the community doesn't push for better coding standards, controlled development, and a sensible roadmap, people will keep running code that nobody has reviewed.\n\nIf you're running Huntarr, keep it off any network you don't fully trust until this is sorted. The *arr apps it wraps have their own API key auth - Huntarr bypasses that entirely.\n\nPlease let others know about this. If you have a Huntarr instance, share this with your community. If you know someone who runs one, share it with them. The more people know about the risks, the more pressure there will be on the maintainer to fix them and improve their development process.\n\nEdit: Looks like r/huntarr went private and the repo got deleted or privated https://github.com/plexguide/Huntarr.io . I'm sorry for everyone that donated to this guy's \"Daughter College Fund\".\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the love on the comments, I'll do my best to reach out to everyone I can. People asking me for help on security reviews, believe me when I say I did little more than the basics - the project was _terrible_.",

I don't have the time to review them properly, and that's why I strive to run a zero-trust network and when apps ask for credentials I am triple-y skeptical.\n\nThat said, I do use AI myself. I have made 2 lightweight Go containers for qbittorrent - one to give me live updates via ntfy.sh and another to update the port on qbittorrent from gluetun automatically and efficiently, avoiding an ugly infinite loop shell script.

I have had Huntarr installed on my stack for a while, the original (just the Huntarr portion) was exposed to the web for a while, but in the past 2 weeks I've completely rewritten my compose stacks and made it internal only. \n\nA few days ago I noticed the massive integrations (the replacement for sonarr, radarr, nzbget, etc...) and thought \"this is pretty sweet.\" and tested it out, and it worked well. I decided to keep my current setup and disable those for the time being though. I saw HuntarrOS yesterday and was going to set it up for a friend, who isn't tech/docker savvy and figured the \"new\" Huntarr would be perfect for him, instead of teaching him about multiple apps. \n\nI got caught up with other stuff yesterday and didn't get around to it. I went to install it today and was confused when I saw that the Github repos were giving 404s when I just accessed them yesterday. When I googled for Huntarr I found this post, luckily. \n\nYou saved our asses here!",

Ports from applications aren't exposed to the host but are available to Nginx so all traffic to an application must go through Nginx.\n\n0 - Only exposed to my own VLAN\n1 - Exposed to myself and my family\n2 - Exposed to all network users\n3 - Exposed publicly\n\nJellyfin will be in level 3 but Huntarr is in level 1. Because no one on my network except for me can access the services these vulnerabilities are of a lower concern. Someone would either have to make Nginx ignore my trusted access list or find a way to get an IP in my VLAN before they could exploit one of these vulnerabilities.\n\nThis is a super simple measure to add to any application to immediately reduce your risk.",

The entire architecture, design decisions, and core foundations were all built without any AI involvement. I only recently began using AI to speed up feature releases and streamline workflows.\n\nI don't blindly accept AI-generated code either. Every line gets reviewed before it's committed. I've got 12+ years of software engineering experience across a wide range of domains, so I'm pretty particular about what makes it into the codebase.\n\nAnd look, AI isn't going anywhere. I genuinely believe it's the future of software development, but only when it's in the hands of experienced engineers who actually understand what they're building.\n\nIf you want to do a security audit, go for it! I'm confident in the app. I believe someone already did a pen test and it came back clean. Always happy to have more eyes on it though!\n\nEdit: Also just curious, what gave you the impression that Booklore is vibe coded?",

I think I started Cleanuparr just a bit before Huntarr was a thing, or just before it was a vibe coded thing, I'm not sure. The dev was releasing feature after feature, something I couldn't compete with (I was using no AI at the time; now I do), and he joined here to ask if it's cool to basically take my app and port it into his, making the shift from C# to Python. I preferred he didn't, as this is a passion project for me and I didn't want it to be hijacked. So we talked, we agreed it wasn't going to happen, but it could be beneficial for users to promote each other. Cleanuparr was almost always more feature rich and customizable than Swapparr (which Huntarr had), and Huntarr was filling the media gaps for triggering searches organically, at the user's discretion, to replace what has been lost or never found. It was basically like I said in the readme: a very good combination. Seemed like a good opportunity to me and we probably did steer some users to the other one's repo by doing so\"",

I have some incredible news for the community: the matter is officially resolved in favor of the entire drone community.\n\n**TLDR:** **AirData UAV** has complied with community concerns, implemented a robust data takeout solution, and we have settled the matter gracefully.\n\n**The free OSS project in question :** [**www.opendronelog.com**](https://www.opendronelog.com)\n\n\\---------------\n\nSince the legal threat is no longer active, I can finally name the company. It was **AirData UAV**, a US based drone log analysis and reporting service. Eran said it's my choice to name them or not name them here in this update post, I choose to name, because I don't have anything bad to say anymore.\n\nDespite the first approach was a C&D, the final outcome was actually better than I hoped for (surprised actually!). A massive thank you goes to u/Archiver_test4, who acted as my legal representative pro bono (for free!! and denied donations). He prepared a powerful response and helped me pass this with confidence. He has even started a new subreddit, [r/Opensource\\_legalAid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Opensource_legalAid/), to help other indie devs in similar situations.\n\n# The Meeting with the Airdata UAV CEO Eran Steiner\n\nIn response to the traction the [original post](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1rbkx5e/large_us_community_came_after_me_for_releasing_a/) gained, AirData CEO **Eran Steiner** reached out for a face to face meeting via email within 6 hours of the post going live. He expressed regret over the legal route they initially took (he took the responsibility for that as well as CEO) and personally saw to it that the following changes were made before we even spoke:\n\n* **Official Data Takeout Solution:** This was the **main goal** (and my demand for data portability and fairness, because it's painful to export files one by one, clicking one after another and waiting). **AirData UAV** now provides a **central takeout solution**, making them fully GDPR compliant. You can now download your data in its original format without needing my 3rd party automation \"patch.\". If you are interested, [please check out here](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/open-dronelog#airdata-exports).\n* **Trademark Resolution:** We agreed that fair representation and disclaimers are the way to go. I have already added these to my project, and I am free to use their name when representing truthful facts, as permitted by EU laws. I won't go into more technical/legal aspects than this of what trademark rights they actually hold or not.\n* **Account Restoration:** As a gesture of goodwill, they have **fully restored my account** and all my log files before I asked. ❤️\n* We agreed to drop all allegations and, in the future, talk through any issues personally rather than involving lawyers.\n\nI am just a solo dev working in my free time, and I have no intention of competing with an established company. I am just thrilled that the community now has true data portability as I hoped for, and they are free to choose as they please based on what features/interface they like. Thank you Eran for making this happen so quick without any drama/delay or missed promise. AirData no longer \"holds your data\" to keep you on their platform. To be fair, they do have a functional and data rich toolset that many in the community still enjoy (including myself!) - They also have a very robust data sync solution which works very well. I am not paid or bribed or sponsored by them, I am just giving credit where it's due.\n\nThank you r/selfhosted for all for the support. It made all the difference! Open Source for the WIN!",

              "text": "My apartment complex doesn’t allow smart breakers, so I was forced to make an entity that calculated kWh usage, and bill cost based on the amount of time my heater/fan has been running. My electricity provider doesn’t have an API that lets me grab raw data so I used a script utilizing playwright that logins into the portal as me, downloads my most current usage .CSV, and exports the data to Home Assistant with a rest sensor. Cron runs it every 5 minutes, so the data is always fresh. It’s basically a hack to read their meter in real time. As long as you know your providers electricity cost, you should be able to calculate the same based on the specs of your HVAC unit. \n\nThe AC/Heating card is a very customized better thermostat ui card that relies on automations to run. The way I have it setup, is that the HVAC unit will never turn on unless the manual override is triggered. Think of it as a safety trigger. Without the override the HVAC unit will turn off every time, whether it's set to run manually, in Home Assistant, or in the Meross app. I press the custom button to turn on the override, select my temperature, and let the automations do the rest. I also have it integrated into my Stream Deck.\n\nWhen the set temperature has been reached for > 5 minutes, the manual override will turn off and that keeps the unit from running up my bill. I have automations that turn on the manual override and set the temp and mode based on what I need. For example, when I come home after being gone for > 30 minutes, the AC will automatically kick on to 68.\n\nThe Sankey card is very custom and relies on a ton of custom entities that are associated with the .CSV data that my rest sensor collects. If you want to know more about that, it would be easier for me to jut drop a pastebin. \n\nHope this helps, let me know if you need to know anything in specific!\n\nEdit: https://pastebin.com/vYLxvevR This is the thermostat card I use.",

It has no labels.\n - Sleep tracking: what does that graph even mean? Did OP not sleep in days? Weeks? Did they have light _and_ deep _and_ REM sleep at the same time?\n - Upcoming events: well, funnily enough that one looks visually bad but is actually legible...\n - System temps: at least this one has _some_ labels. Making it truly beautiful could involve sharing the colours from the graph with the current values above rather than the current gray.\n - The sankey diagram about power usage is combining billing and power usage, and crosses two lines for absolutely no reason?\n - The online/latency/... table lacks a bit of contrast on the online cells, but I guess there are bigger problems...\n - Similarly the Plex stats have colours that are not accounting for the background at all. That movie count particularly...\n - Oh, we're back to the thermostat! Why is this not underneath the weather?\n\nYeah, at a glance, it looks pretty. But the data presented here is nothing close to beautiful. It's form over function, by a lot. I genuinely like the style, it's its own thing, and some of the visualisations _could_ be very nice.

I was pretty impressed with the speed at which I could make it based on about 15-20 minutes of outline using the Plan mode in Cursor and then several iterations of testing and re-prompting.\n\nWell then I actually looked at the code and was pretty horrified. For example, It had generated two sets of sidebar code, one for the overall view, and one for when I was clicked on an image for display.\n\nI did ask a friend who uses these tools more regularly and he pointed out I needed to direct the AI to reuse code and create templates as often as possible, but I can absolutely see how someone just sleepwalking their way through generating an application could run into these sorts of issues. \n\nIt also is one of those cases where its the most dangerous when you don't know what to add to your outline/prompts to keep it controlled. But if you already know enough to ask that, then wouldn't you already be capable of writing it yourself? I suppose there's some arguments to be made about increasing your speed and then checking back later, but if junior/non-devs are going to use these tools in lieu of learning then they'll never know they'd need to watch out for these issues in the first place! Its a real chicken/egg problem.\n\nI think the best approach is one I've seen other engineers point out, which is to learn it the actual way and only when you're comfortable with writing these things yourself should you really dip into any sort of automated code generation, and even then keep it on a short leash. Its something I'm still struggling with applying, though I've gotten some pretty decent unit testing code out of it, even if I do have to read over each test and make sure they're *actually performing a test that can fail*.",

What AI does is increase code output in return for greatly increased technical debt. Unfortunately *reducing* that technical debt isn't faster than before.\n\n\nThis *feels* much faster at first, but as the technical debt becomes worse and worse the generated code becomes less and less reliable because the terrible code is so badly encapsulated that the AI cannot keep all the necessary parts in its limited context.  \n\n\nAs a result the number of bugs increases and you'll have angry users/customers yelling at you to fix it. At this point you have two options: fix the technical debt or abandon the project.\n\n\nBecause solo AI developers didn't actually have to put much work into building the project they usually end up choosing the latter, which is why so many vibecoded projects end up abandoned after 6-18 months.\n\n\nIf you choose the former you'll slow down *a lot* and in the end need to spend more time fixing the mess left by AI than it would have taken to just do it without AI in the first place.\n\n\nThe only people who are genuinely permanently more productive with it are those in big corporations offloading the technical debt on someone else. The company as a whole still suffers from it, though. Looking at you, Microslop.",

It’s safe enough living on my network but I don’t trust it public facing and it’s not fair to anyone else to even hint that it might be. I don’t understand the code, I only know it does what it supposed to and know that it’s probably one giant security vulnerability. But that’s not what this guy did. \n\nEspecially after misrepresenting themselves as a “security expert”, the whole thing feels scummy. Almost intentionally so. \n\nSo yeah, it’d be nice to have a sub to show off and share vibe coded shit with the understanding that the author has no idea what it’s doing behind the scene, and keep this sub for legit projects. (Not that any of us should be running anything we don’t understand, but at the same time there is peer review and the community does a good job of self policing to someone protect the people here are aren’t as tech savvy) \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",

That looks like a endpoint to exfiltrate data to me. I'm looking at it through the glasses of \"suspected malicious intent\". I just find it suspicious that they pulled the source code after the vulnerability became public instead of addressing the issue, as if they would be hiding something. Even if the app is not explicitly sending telemetry to expose the keys (which would be way more obvious to spot), it wouldn't be the first time that conscious mistakes were added into source code (There was one added to the Linux Kernel not long time ago, I don't have the name of it at hand right now) that came in form of deliberate buffer overflows (Way more sophisticated than this one). In any case, they might have been teenagers who just freaked out after the vibe coding backlash, but I'd still be curious of this strange behavior.",

I was on the LB and DNS team, and worked with the backbone/transit network team. Overall I'd say the amount of effort was minor (which is good or else management probably wouldn't have let us do it).\n\nGranted that left 40,000+ hosts on ipv4, but with literally only one or two exceptions, none accepted internet traffic. Probably 1/3 had public IPs the rest were either fully private or behind NAT.\n\nAt the time we were rolling out our own cloud, and it had v6 as an experimental option.\n\nThe reality though- all of this was driven by tech geeks, and only allowed to proceed because it didn't cost much. The business certainly didn't give a shit. When amventure capital firm took over, anything that didn't have a _direct_ tie to increasing revenue/reducing costs was killed.\n\nTwo big tech problems that we were facing were: ACLs and geo-location. I honestly can't remember where we left those two things, but they have the same fundamental issue: mapping the IPv6 IP space is _hard_, instead of 4billion routable ips there are 2 quintillion of them. I haven't kept up in that space, but I imagine either: there are new strategies, network appliances have scaled to the point where they can deal with it, or (and most likely) they're still a problem because nobody cares.",

There's an easy test for this: can you use 1.0.0.0/8, 2.0.0.0/8 etc on the network, or would that cause problems? If it would cause problems then congrats, you've discovered why we have v6.\n\nEven when you have a network that would actually be fine with that -- what happens when your company gets bought out and needs to merge networks with somebody else who also figured that keeping everything in 1/8 was fine?\n\nAlso it's easier to keep things logically laid out in v6, because you have more space available and you can mostly do your subnetting on character boundaries. For example, you could use `2001:db8:xxyy:zzzz::` where x, y and z are region/building/VLAN respectively, e.g. `2001:db8:102:3::/64` is VLAN 3 in building 2 in region 1, or however you want to do it. You don't need to mess around with memorizing subnetting tables or doing conversions, or trying to work out if it's .160-191. or .172-191., or spend any time thinking about whether you'll ever need to grow beyond 256 hosts in any given network and if so whether 512 will be enough or if you'll need more. You'll always have enough IPs on every network, and you'll have enough space that if you need to grow to multiple networks you'll generally have room to do it in place rather than needing to fragment or renumber.\n\nOn v4 you'll usually end up with a mess of NAT on any non-trivial network. When you've got a host whose address is 192.168.2.42, but it shows up as 203.0.113.8 to internet hosts, but you had an RFC1918 clash on a few of your acquisitions so some parts of your company access it via 192.168.202.42 and other parts need 172.16.1.42 and your VPN sometimes can't reach it because some home users use 192.168.2.0/24... how is that easier to comprehend than \"the IP is 2001:db8:113:2::42\"?",

NAT and port forwarding might seem a bit clunky but it's also intuitive in a way, in that if I want to send a packet in to a machine inside my network then I just send it to my router's public IP with an appropriate port forward rule, and the router relays it to my machine's v4 address that it uses for pretty much everything, while with IPv6 that same machine will have 2-3 addresses at any one time and you're supposed to use different ones in different contexts, and some of them may or may not work, and the public facing one might keep changing or stay the same, and even though it's public facing it still might get firewalled by the router except it isn't as clear that the router is going to be doing anything other than just relaying the packets because they aren't meant to be for the router. \n\n\nI'm sure it's simple enough to get your head around with the effort but the point is that it's still *some* effort and it's effort that doesn't need to be spent *at all* if you just stick with NAT, at least short term.

Considering how much effort deploying a new L3 protocol is, it doesn't make sense to deploy one that we know is going to be too small only to then have to turn around and deploy another one immediately afterwards, so we went with an address size that's _definitely_ going to be too big.\n\nIt's not possible for any address format longer than 32 bits to be compatible with v4, because v4 only supports addresses up to 32 bits, no matter how you design the new protocol. We wouldn't have needed a new protocol in the first place otherwise. There _are_ various ways of working around v4's lack of forwards compatibility, but they all involve some kind of compromise or tradeoff -- and v6 is already using basically every workable approach. I've yet to see anybody come up with a method of designing a new protocol that a) is more compatible with v4 than v6 already is, and b) would actually work.\n\n(I've seen plenty of people fail (b), or come up with schemes that are functionally equivalent to an existing method but using different terms to explain everything. 6to4 is a popular one to reinvent, as is \"dual stack but I'm going to explain it weirdly and claim it isn't dual stack\".)",

A reboot fixes it every time. I think it happens since I removed dhcpcd and let the kernel handle RAs, which was necessary because dhcpcd doesn't understand RIOs that are needed for Matter.\n\nIPv6 also has no proper way to assign fixed addresses to clients or to report addresses back to DNS. There are a couple of RFCs but to my knowledge there is currently nothing that would work with Windows, Linux and Android clients.\n\nThere is also nothing in terms of load balancing between internet lines. It's as if the IPv6 people didn't even think about how to solve this. Well, there is NPT with ULAs, but if a hostname resolves to an IPv4 address and a ULA, other hosts will prefer the IPv4 address.",

          "text": "\\> Why do we keep using IPv4?\n\nThis is a great question. The answer is because it costs too much for most organizations (universities, businesses, governments, service providers) to even \\*support\\* IPv6, let alone \\*switch\\* to it. I'll give a practical example.\n\nMy university network is IPv4 only. I asked the IT department what their reasoning was for choosing that route instead of going dual-stack, which would provide a happy medium between feature richness, compatibility with other services, and stability. Their answer was essentially that revising their threat model and security policies and deploying/supporting network gear that supports IPv6 is too costly to justify the benefits. From their perspective, there is no \\*need\\* to support IPv6, so investing time and money into doing so would be wasteful.\n\nThe problem is that if you, a provider of services like Jellyfin or Vaultwarden, want your users (of which you yourself are one) to be able to access your services from anywhere, you are forced by these types of network administrators to provide support for IPv4, which in turn perpetuates their lack of motivation to support IPv6. We have ourselves a catch 22.\n\nI experienced this whole fiasco myself when trying to deploy a similar stack of services exclusively over IPv6, and was met with compatibility hell from all fronts. Many residential networks have it disabled by default, many orgs don't support it at all, and nobody wants to dig around in their router settings or call their ISP to bug them about the lack of support when there is already a working, simple, mature solution: just using IPv4.\n\nIPv6 optimists will tell you it is only a matter of time before the whole world supports IPv6. I am here to tell you that this will not happen. Too much of our infrastructure and network modeling revolves around NAT and IPv4. The dual-stack reality has metastasized, and will likely not go away in our lifetimes.",

It’s the same internet either way and end users simply don’t care, your ISP handles the plumbing and it’s all magic to the user.

In theory your ISP could give you a static ipv6 because there is no shortage of them that's true, but mine does not. In fact my ipv4 is almost static but my ipv6 changes every single day. This is a big problem. Creating Firewall rules for example is complex because you now have devices changing the ip address and you can not control this. Secondly ddns of course now has to run on every device you want to reach, but every device maybe supports different ddns providers. There is a way around that with dynv6, but even that is not plug and play. For every new device manual interaction with the ddns provider is needed.\n\nThe final roadblock however is surprisingly docker. I use dockers MACVLAN network and that is just unable to work with dynamic ipv6 addresses. So I stay with ipv4.",

ISPs need older non-IPv6 gear to retire, or non-IPv6 engineers, and that goes one by one, slowly. \n\nI think people underestimate how fast change goes, a large part of the server landscape is still oldschool Unix for example, even though you’d think it’s all Linux by now.

My self-hosted services are primarily running IPv6, with Jellyfin being a notable exception because the Roku TV in our living room refuses to do IPv6 despite enabling in the stupid secret menu.\n\nAs for how complicated it is, I honestly think the overall protocol suite design is _less_ complicated than the current iteration of IPv4 deployment. CIDR is the same but for more bits and once I wrapped my head around Neighbor Discovery and SLAAC it all gelled for me.\n\nYes there have been a few attempts at various important things but afaict nothing core has changed for at least a decade.

Thus, the question isn't one for users, but for ISPs. The user (e.g. you) has to ask their ISP, \"do you support IPv6?\" If the ISP doesn't support it, the user cannot do anything about it except:\n\n- find a different ISP that does support it; or\n- join an IPv6 network using an IPv4 tunnel (e.g. [Hurricane Electric IPv6 Tunnel Broker](https://tunnelbroker.net/)), but this can be prohibitively slow and/or blocked by various sites/services you might want to visit/use.\n\nAn ISP that does support IPv6 can support IPv4 quite easily by just offering a translation service. The ISP only needs to do any actual IPv4 routing at their network boundary; all internal (non-boundary) infrastructure can exclusively speak IPv6. Translation techniques such as 464XLAT eliminate as much IPv4 as possible whilst still allowing IPv6-only clients to communicate with IPv4 peers.\n\n***\n\nIPv6 prevalence has increased from 10% to 50% globally over the last 10 years, so the future looks good. However, the present is still very much a coin-flip, so for now, if you want your services to be accessible by a random subset of the general public, you'll need to make your services accessible via an IPv4 address too.\n\nIn the case of single NAT, most people are familiar with how to do this: port forwarding.\n\nIn the case of CGNAT, the ISP is responsible for the port forwarding controls, and if multiple customers are behind the same public IP address and want the same port number forwarded to them, this is not possible, so ISPs that use CGNAT do not offer port forwarding. Instead, you can ask your ISP whether they can provide you with a publicly reachable IPv4 address for a fee, or you can rent a server to act as a general-purpose relay by running IP translation software like [Jool](https://nicmx.github.io/Jool) on it (allowing it to receive packets addressed to one of its own IPv4 addresses and forward these to an IPv6 address you specify; and vice-versa).",

Do I use SLAAC, DHCPv6, track the interface? \n\nLike you said port forwarding isn't a concept so everything is down to firewall rules, setting up smart firewall rules gets more complicated when you have entire subnets to think about. \n\nLike for example, imagine you run a teamspeak server, screen sharing is P2P, you have to figure out firewall rules between specific IPv6 addresses, both in and out of the LAN. With IPv4 you really can just do some basic port forwards and it's less complicated. \n\nThe question of security gets complicated there as well. Unfortunately IPv4 has taught a generation to block ports as a means of security where as IPv6 is generally a configuration error instead of a security situation. \n\nThen getting into how addresses are assigned, how NAT isn't the same concept, how most places don't support pure IPv6 without using IPv4 fallback, it just gets chaotic.",

And, unfortunately, the only way around this is with NAT66... but not needing NAT is the main selling point of IPv6.\n\nMy ISP gives me a /60, which allows 16 subnets. There are ISPs that give out a single /64, which allows for one subnet. I currently use 37 IPv4 subnets. Is that excessive? Sure. But the main fun of the Internet, to me, was always that you get the same toys to play with as the biggest companies. With IPv6 that's no longer case - your ISP now decides how many toys you get.\n\nIn the beginning, the idea was to assign at least a /48 to everybody. Unfortunately that was never enforced.\n\nAnd good luck getting more than a /64, or even a /64, for a mobile backup Internet. With IPv4, if my Internet goes down, I can just hook up my phone and everything works again. With IPv6 that would be more difficult to do as you would need to ULA addresses for the backup link and NAT66 on your phone.\n\nIPv6 could have been good but it doesn't have the same freedom as IPv4.",

NAT, which actually originated from a bespoke workaround solution\n\n2. Develop a new IP with a much larger address space\n\nThe biggest problem with IPv6 is that it's not strictly backwards compatible, so the device has to be able to support IPv6 to be able to use it. That shouldn't be so hard, right? Wrong, kiddo. We are still dealing with it today where some websites (like fucking Github, holy crap M$ needs to get their shit together) still don't support IPv6. Because many cloud services don't use IPv6, many ISPs (like fucking Virgin Media, get your shit together) also don't rollout IPv6, leading to a chicken and egg situation. \n\nTo all the people saying IPv6 is \"hard to read\", as a network engineer, you either have no idea what you're talking about, or you're not as good of a network engineer as you think you are.\n\nIPv6 is awesome and everyone should use it if possible.",

A lot of programs still use IP literals for access control, or assume they don’t change. For external access (ex. DNS), this also means each server needs to individually setup a cron job. Internal addressing is solvable via ULAs, but that does require an advanced setup.\n- Managing clients that can behave like routers. By this I mean setups such as a server running VMs or phone WiFi tethering. Neither IPv4 not IPv6 were designed for this, but NAT is a good solution which v6 discourages. The preferred v6 method is DHCPv6-PD, which isn’t commonly deployed outside of ISP<->router (and may not be possible in the home, especially with prefix rotation).\n- You can’t rely on v6 connectivity. My work for example does not provide it, so I make my services available over v4 anyways. Using SIIT-DC can avoid the need for IPv4 inside your network but you lose some of those benefits you listed.\n- Getting NTP to clients. There isn’t a Router Advertisement option for this, and support for DHCPv6 Information Request is not great. I had to use DHCPv4 to bootstrap a Talos machine as an example.",

      "text": "BookLore 2.0 is here.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, BookLore is a self-hosted digital library for ebooks, comics, and now audiobooks, with multi-user support, smart shelves, metadata fetching, Kobo/KOReader sync, OPDS, and built-in readers.\n\nAlso, we just hit 10K stars on GitHub, which is wild. Huge thanks to everyone who's contributed code, bug reports, and feedback over the past year. If you want to support the project, you can sponsor on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/booklore) or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/bookloredev).\n\nHere's what's new:\n\n**Multi-Format & Audiobook Support**\n\n* A single book entry can now hold EPUB, PDF, CBZ, and audiobook formats all under one roof. No more duplicate entries for different formats.\n* Dedicated audiobook player with streaming playback, session tracking, narrator metadata, and sidebar filtering by narrator.\n\n**Reader Upgrades**\n\n* PDF reader: annotations (highlights and notes), dark/light mode, range streaming for large files\n* Ebook reader: fullscreen, keyboard shortcuts, search, go-to-percentage navigation, text copy\n* Comic reader: fullscreen, slideshow mode, RTL reading direction, long strip mode, keyboard navigation\n* Fully bidirectional and user-scoped, reading progress syncs both ways\n\n**And a lot more:**\n\n* 10 new statistics charts (reading pace, distributions, heatmaps, completion tracking, etc.)\n* Dedicated series browser with search, filtering, and sorting\n* Duplicate book detection and merging\n* Shelves and magic shelves sync as Kobo tags\n* Annotation notebook collecting all your highlights in one place\n* Audit logging for admin actions\n* Author bios and images via Audnexus\n* Sidecar metadata file support (`.metadata.json`)\n* Content restrictions (age and content ratings) for magic shelves\n* 15+ languages supported through Weblate\n* Upgraded to Java 25, Spring Boot 4, removed nginx (Angular served directly from Spring Boot)\n* Bookdrop folder polling, login rate limiting, upload progress tracking, multi-field sorting, and a long list of bug fixes\n\n**A note on the v2 launch**\n\nApologies to those who ran into issues during the initial v2.0.0 rollout. Some setups broke due to file permission problems, especially for Portainer, Unraid, and Proxmox users. In v1.x the Docker container ran as root because the embedded nginx required it. In v2 I removed nginx to pave the way for a rootless container, but I overlooked some edge cases in that transition. With 200+ commits and just me doing all the manual regression testing, I missed some critical areas. That's on me.\n\nThings are in a much better place now with v2.0.4. If you're upgrading and still hit permission issues, make sure your data, bookdrop, and book folder permissions match the user/group set in your Docker Compose file. You can also check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/booklore-app/booklore/issues) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/booklore) where others have posted fixes. I'd also really appreciate help with testing before future major releases, so if you're interested, hop over to Discord.\n\nTry it out: [demo.booklore.org](https://demo.booklore.org) (user: `booklore`, pass: `9HC20PGGfitvWaZ1`)\n\nIf you're enjoying BookLore, a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/booklore-app/booklore) helps more people find it.\n\n**FAQ**\n\n**Q: You use a lot of emojis and ship features fast. Is this vibe coded?** No, I just like emojis 😄. BookLore is AI-assisted, not vibe coded. I've been building software for years, going back to early Android (anyone remember Cupcake, Donut, Eclair?) and late Symbian. The project started before AI tooling went mainstream, so all the architecture you see was built by hand. You're in good hands.\n\n**Q: Any plans for mobile apps?** Yes! I've been prototyping iOS and Android apps for a few months and they're getting close. No ETA yet, but actively in the works.\n\n**Q: BookLore uses a lot of RAM, any way to reduce it?** That's a tradeoff of running on the JVM, but I think the benefits outweigh it. Java has also been making strides in memory efficiency lately. In v2 I added a flag that should bring RAM down by roughly 10-15%.\n\n**Q: Any plans to move to PostgreSQL?** Not at this time. BookLore is deeply tied to MariaDB and migrating would be extremely disruptive given the user base we have now.\n\n**Q: What are your future plans for BookLore?** Short term, stabilizing the v2 release. After that, maybe some social features? I'd love to hear what you all want. Come hang out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/booklore) or drop suggestions in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/booklore-app/booklore/issues).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hh6lb7f4m5mg1.png?width=3474&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f7e4d2a28c39baa60689f055a6ced64dc9c3265\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ki8je45m5mg1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=00c37f7b5bc8a72c1763ad8a86c34f9ef9ae9f28\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1qpsri2dn5mg1.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=c63c982cdabf1d4b600a3e839447af5e46414761",

I'm one of those people that jump back and forth between books and audiobooks, but there's no chapter search in the Booklore audiobook function (that I can see anyway), which makes it a non starter for me.\n\nIf it ever gets chapter/track search, I'd be down to try it again. Bonus points if it gets a feature like audible where it will sync progress between ebook and audiobook, but I imagine that would be a pain to implement.",

Sounds weird, but it makes for a bad UI experience.\n\n\\- Please also include a demo PDF book in your demo site so that I can see how PDF's interact\n\n\\- Main top menu while reading a book > Settings (gear icon) > Layout: I wish this had a clearly defined setting for 1 vs 2 pages, feels like this is missing\n\n  \nBecause of these reasons, I'm going with Kavita for now. If you fix those, I'll try it again on the demo page to see if I like it. The above sections aren't demands either, stuff takes time, and features take priority over others. I just have a certain preference for stuff, and if its not up to what I want, I don't have time to pivot these days.\n\nI would also compare your app to others present, and steal ideas or features. I say this because if I'm going to deploy a web based app, it better be good. Hard to explain but I have never been impressed with something like calibre-web since it looks like a janky version of iTunes but worse. At that point, I would probably just roll with a Samba share and figure out a decent reader setup on my local drive. But the minute I use a web app, I want it to be good and rival other good designs.",

The decision to drop nginx and serve Angular directly from Spring Boot is a surprisingly big deal for usability; every dependency you remove is one less thing to configure and one less place something can go wrong, especially for people running this on a Pi or a low-spec VPS. Curious how the Spring Boot static file serving handles cache headers and compression in practice compared to what nginx was doing — that's usually the part that bites you later when you realize assets aren't being gzip'd. Also genuinely excited about the bidirectional Kobo sync. The shelf-to-tag sync in particular is the feature that would actually pull me off Calibre-Web. Any plans for ADE/DRM support, or is that a deliberate non-goal for the project?",

      "text": "Just a question that has been going round my head for a few days.\n\nWhat ever your opinion on it. We need to acknowledge that \"Vibe Coding\" is growing, and its not going to decrease.\n\nThe fact the entry point is so low from a skills perspective, and time required to pump them out, effectively makes them disposable.\n\nMembers here have been concerned for a while about the quality, security, longevity of these apps, and it turning into a flood - and as if on que, over the past few weeks, we've seen exactly this - We've been flooded (this place is unusable on Fridays).  Now, issues are identified in the code, and rather than facing and fixing them, the \"devs\" are running off, shutting down the repositories etc.\n\nThis leads to 2 conflicting issues \n\n1) There is an open hostility to those who share vibe-coded apps - where we see outright hostility and vitriol language. \n\n2) There are going to be some quality vibe-coded apps, where they are properly developed, supported and managed..  as community, they would benefit members.\n\nSo my question is - how do we bridge this? My I've been thinking on this for a few days, and the only solution I can see, we have an associated sub (same mods etc) for these apps to be posted. maybe after a time, once they've proven they are well run and have longevity,  they can \"graduate\"... lets call it SelfHosted-Vibe or VibeHosted.",

That doesn't make the product less usable, just hard to maintain but that's my responsibility. I find it as a legitimate way of creating prototypes of software and seeing if they work, not good for end products but good enough to make something \"just functional\" and see what can be improved. Particularly from a UI/feature perspective and seeing if it's feasible. \n\nI guess labelling them specifically as vibe-coded prototypes or \"learning projects\" or smth would be nice and I don't disagree with OP. It's normal for communities when there's spam of something that just annoys the rest of the userbase to create a new channel or subcommunity (the mlp section on 4Chan comes to mind). Stablishing clear guides/links would help, lots of communities have them even if there's incentives for breaking them.",

It is the exact same reason that so many tools to detect code/IP plagiarism fail: Stack overflow is just too useful and most people can't be bothered to even change the variable names.\n\nBut, with a competent engineer, that isn't a huge issue. They look at the code they are using and then someone else peer reviews it.\n\nSo my view? If the people in charge of a project even know how to hide it is vibe coded, it is probably sufficient. That means not leaving in the config scripts used for claude et al. That means not committing hundreds of randomly generated file names with every commit. That means not having a project with 20k SLOC that is three days old. Hell, that means not having chatgpt generate their marketing copy.\n\nAt which point it is no different than any other project. People SHOULD be reviewing what they run within their LAN. People SHOULD be relying on established projects with a lot of eyes on them.\n\nBecause the slop slinging idiots? They can't defend that. They add Linus Torvalds to their commit history (MS shut THAT down real fast...) and then just keep accusing people of not being engineers.",

You could have someone genuinely learning and coding an app themself and it can also be insecure in many ways and i personally think it would be fine to post it on this subreddit if the person really want to learn stuff, take the criticism and most importantly addresses bugs and security flaws once people report them.

It's can also be great at tracking down bugs or explaining why your code behaves a certain way.\n\nBut all of that relies on someone who knows what they are doing double checking it's work and verifying that the AI did the right thing the right way.\n\nIt can take a skilled programmer and make them faster. Sometimes it can even take a novice programmer and help them do more advanced things, if they take the time to understand everything themselves instead of blindly accepting the AI's output.

I am not here to step on anyone’s toes. But I have great belief in AI as a tool to create great software. It has made the creation of software much more available for much more people.

And once the AI way is matured I am sure this place will also welcome it. But I don’t think we are there yet.\n\nAnd I need a place like this as well. Where the software shared is trusted, it is checked by people who knows their stuff. The vast majority of vibecoded software is experimental and none of us should trust it very much. But how do we get better? By learning from each other and have a positive spin on it.\n\nAt least that is my idea behind it. I think it’s needed. It’s not on me though. I just think we should head in that direction.\n",

I also strongly dislike the demand for AI use to be disclosed. Firstly because not using AI at all in 2026 is a huge handicap, so no good developer will completely eschew its use. Secondly because it just enables the lazy dismissive behaviour and bad actors can just deny it.\n\nI think people creating solutions for problems they have is great, and AI lowering the bar for entry is a good thing.

A solid test framework (including manual) solves that.\n\nIf it’s insecure code I agree that it’s a huge problem. The Huntarr debacle provided that and in general AI code out of the box is insecure. However, there’s no guarantee that someone writing code by hand knows how to secure their code either. To write secure code requires a combination of knowledge and process. Knowledge how to secure your API endpoints, knowledge how to validate that the data is secure at rest, knowledge how to sanitize data to avoid injection attacks and the list goes on. Process for how to validate those assertions, process to test that it actually works the way you think it does. You can absolutely do all that with AI assistance but it’s not enough to say “make my code secure”. And even with all that there can be security issues, in any code. That’s why we have things like responsible disclosure but obviously that only works if the developer is serious and don’t ban people who try to help (Huntarr again).\n\nOne possible option could be that any AI assisted app have to provide a security disclosure. Could be as simple as “show the output from all security code scanners you used” or it could be more comprehensive where the author have to provide detailed information about what steps were taken to secure the app. Maybe combine that with moderation of posts, a pre-approval step if you’d like.\n\nNot sure what to do about the ongoing maintenance issue, I think that problem will sort itself out.

Many noobs use AI as the expert (vibe coding); many expert devs use AI as a flawed subordinate (acceleration). The difference is skill & experience. Both want to help the community by open-sourcing their code. IMHO arrogant vibe coders are the exception (e.g., huntarr, clawdbot) not the rule.\n\n\nAnd easy bot handling e.g. keywords and optionally reddit or repo stats: suggest switching to devnoob.",

Containerization isn't good enough for me, it needs its own isolated system to run off of.\n\nIt was a fun little experiment to see what AI agents can be.

While we’re not open source, we offer a generous free self-hosted plan that many teams in this community can benefit from. Recently we’ve also been investing heavily in AI-driven app building. We believe this approach makes iteration faster and gives more flexibility than drag-and-drop based builders, especially since you can still access and customize the underlying code when needed.\n\nIf anyone is considering migrating from Retool or exploring alternatives, happy to help and answer any questions.\n\nOh, and we're also NOT VC-backed.

Same with the filters text, it is too smol compared to other text on the page, and also filter options are too light for their size. Oh, yeah, \"Read Now\" and \"Details\" have different margins, and \"Read Now\" is bigger in height even so that it has smaller text size.\n\nSecond screenshot now has large base text for some reason, much bigger than on the previous screenshot, icons are once again not the same size, also margins for the buttons are different.\n\nDefine fixed set of text sizes, keep options small so you won't have to second guess which to pick.

What stuff would you download and which services would you self host?\n\nI have a few Raspberry Pi boards and a few terabytes of external HDDs, SSDs and USB flash drives. The goal would be to create an internet replacement that would work off grid. I'd connect them to a bunch of routers and APs to basically connect the whole neighborhood. Things would get powered by power banks, car batteries and solar panels (that's why I'm going with low power devices like Raspberry Pi).\n\nI've been self hosting for over 10 years and I've used a bunch of different services and know how to set up stuff. But I'd like to hear from other people to see if there's more stuff that'd be useful.\n\nSo first I'd need to configure the web server and local domains and somehow create my own local certificate authority so people can add that CA to trusted and automatically trust any new SSL cert I generate.  \n\nThen I'd need to create a local Debian repository with all common software so I can use apt to install software on other devices and servers.\n\nAnd of course other software for local search engine, wiki, DNS, chat, forums, social media, library, maps, maybe basic AI, etc.\n\nWhat else should I look for so I have stuff to learn from and fix programming rleated stuff (can I download entire forums like Stack Overflow, XDA, Arch, etc.)?\n\nSo, what exactly do I need and what would be good to have? Which service is best for each use case? What are the things I should pay attention to so I don't end up with stuff I can't fix without access to the internet?",

Meshtastic obviously isn’t viable long distance, and while digital modes make it easier to get HF comms established, you only learn thru practice. Many people prep by tossing a radio in their kit, but when the time comes, they won’t know how to use it. AX.25 is a good place to start, it’s what backs ipv4 via RF and APRS. (Good ol’ dial up basically)\n\nAlso, yes bring back irc, but you can get on ham networks already established including world wide* store and forward email (winlink) and BBS’s. It’s not linked to wan in many instances (networks/groups) with still continent/world wide reach. So I like to refer it it as ham wan, or a ham internet detached (air-gapped, tho it’s not air-gapped by netsec definition)",

Add Stack Overflow data dump (another ~80GB compressed) and you've basically got the world's technical knowledge offline. The ZIM format is surprisingly efficient for this.\n\nFor the neighborhood network idea, you'd want:\n- dnsmasq for DHCP + local DNS (lightweight, runs on anything)\n- Some kind of file sharing, Samba or even a basic nginx file listing\n- Kiwix-serve for the wiki/SO dumps\n- Maybe Calibre-web if you've got ebooks\n\nThe part most people skip: actually test it with the internet unplugged. I ran my homelab air-gapped for a weekend once and discovered how many containers silently depend on external DNS, NTP, or CDN assets to even start. Half my docker-compose stack wouldn't come up because images referenced external health check endpoints.\n\nAlso worth pre-downloading: the Arch Wiki (better than most official docs for Linux troubleshooting), a local apt/yum mirror for your OS, and honestly just a folder of PDFs for datasheets of your specific hardware.

Run tests where you shut down your internet connection for a few hours (just doing in a few minutes isn't enough, a lot of stuff will be cached) and see if all your services are working properly. I ran into a few issues when setting mine up and running that test.\n\nI also run my own CA. It's a bit of a pain needing to redeploy new the certs when they expire once a year but I just do a wildcard cert so it's easier. Works perfectly fine for 99% of situations. The only issue comes up with images/containers that bundle a list of trusted CAs and don't want to play nice with my own root CA.",

The sound of a sort of generator hhd spinning just anything besides the noise of the world becomes a giant beacon for miles around. When everyone hears it within 100 miles will come knocking at your door. The good the bad and the ugly. People would be fighting for food clean water ammunition basic just survival. The first thing they will do is kill you then take what’s valuable in a world of yesteryear and they will move on quickly. Because in a world where it’s kill or be killed and cannibalism has become fashionable as the worlds population decends into pure nightmare. Anything that makes you stand out from the noise of the world means you will have to fight. Sure some will band doesn’t mean there gonna be nice. Maybe think about how to store it long term so after humanity has literally eaten itself up you can then access the data to start rebuilding. But host neighborhood wide internet is a terrible idea and one that will not end very nicely. There’s plenty of recent disasters in modern recorded history where populations broke down into cannibalism after just a few days of separation from modern amenities. So it’s not outside the realm of reality. Survive first then rebuild. Not the other way around. Also most of the rules you think you know for surviving zero day. They will probably get you killed quickly. Leave the cities leave by means that no one is thinking about and for at least the first couple of years if not first decade trust no one.

Then you need to take instruction in how to use the weapons that you are going to need to buy in order to protect yourself, physically, from those bad people.  Then you need to buy the weapons and start to equip the location that you have purchased to make it as impregnable and survivable as you can against the bad people.  You might want to include a good stock of printed books that explain how to survive without any electricity or electronics, at all. To be able to grow food and make fires to keep yourself warm.  You should  become very well acquainted with those books and that material, and try them out, before the \"apocalyptic scenario\" happens, so that you understand what you are capable of doing and whether/how you need to adjust your plan.\n\nOnce you have done this, you can start to stock up on stuff that you will need.  First of all, ammo, to defend yourself.  Second water to drink.  Third, food with very long storage lives until you become self-sufficient in growing stuff.  Fourth, tools to help you grow food and maintain your shelter and defensable position and water supply.  Fifth, clothing to protect you from the elements while you are growing food.  Sixth, simple iron pots and other cooking equipment - preferably completely unbreakable metal.\n\nNotice that I have not mentioned the internet yet.  I don't think you will need the internet for a VERY long time, given the scenario you specify.\n\nWhen you have re-invented the fundamental civil structure of the 21st century, THEN you can start to think about re-establishing the internet.\n\n  \nYou might also want to practice your survival skills for at least a year, through every season, without any contact from other people, to see how well you do, and what you might want to change.  If you do not practice, when the \"apocalypse\" happens, you will not be prepared, and you will not survive.",

The tool isn’t the core issue  hygiene and common sense is. Non–mission-critical software is usually fine if it’s deployed responsibly, and it’s not that hard to apply basic hardening. AI can significantly speed up development, and that matters. Most FOSS developers have jobs next to their hobby. \n\nI’m not saying AI is the holy grail, and fully vibe-coded projects probably shouldn’t be exposed directly to the open internet without proper review. But if it gets the job done, its ran locally I really don't see the issue.\n\nEven in light of Huntarr, the scale of the issue feels exaggerated. If you didn’t expose the service publicly, you were likely fine.

In my opinion, they’re pretty basic for getting yt-dlp to work with services that are blocked in some countries, not to mention cookies.\n\nIt would also be nice to have instructions for running the app locally (not in docker). I assume it’s just about creating a virtual environment and installing requirements.txt, but where would I set things like THEME_COLOR or change the port?\n\nAnd sorry if this is a dumb question: if I run the .py file locally, do I need to manually update yt-dlp inside the virtual environment, or can the app handle that on its own?\n\nP.S. Personally, I see this more as a video downloader, with the option to just preview sometimes without downloading locally. And if it's also possible to download only audio, that would be just awesome. Either way thanks, I'm always all for new lightweight UIs for yt-dlp.",

      "text": "A big draw of self hosting is the ability to control your own data.\n\nHowever, I've repeatedly run into a problem in self-hosting which I think of as the Gray Box problem. To understand gray boxes, lets first look at black and white boxes.\n\n# Black Box:\n\nIn a black box app, you neither possess or directly manage your files.\n\nYour files live on someone else's hard drive, and you're denied access except via their UI.\n\nWhen you upload your files to a provider (think: google), they effectively enter a black box: getting them out again is difficult, and it's impossible to interact with the raw files themselves - your only access is through their proprietary UI. If you are able to get them out of the Black Box via a takeout procedure, the metadata is often unreliable and the files have no innate organization.\n\nIn contract to a White Box:\n\n# White Box:\n\nIn a white box program, your files live on your hard drive, and you can manage them directly. The program sits on top of your own folder structure, but provides all the additional benefits of a UI for organization and other features.\n\nThe critical White Box criteria: \\*The program picks up changes made to your files both inside AND outside of itself.\\*\n\nThe best example I know of is Digikam, the open source photo management software. It sits over top your photos, and you can organize photos/metadata through the program's UI, but it **also** picks up changes you make directly to the files themselves - changes not made through Digikam.\n\nAnother white box example is Obsidian. Although it's proprietary software and not open source, you barely notice because it's a white box program - it sits atop files on your hard drive, which you can edit freely, but adds incredible management benefits when you use the UI.\n\n# Gray Box:\n\nIn a gray box application, your files live on your hard drive (or NAS), but management is restricted to the program's UI.\n\nExample: Paperless-ngx.\n\nYou can upload your files to Paperless, but if you change, move or edit the files outside of the UI, you will break it.\n\nNOTE: Custom Storage Paths do NOT make an application into a white box program. Simply accessing them in a human readable format is not enough: you must be able to edit them freely outside of the program's UI, and have the program accept those changes without breaking.\n\nThis is the issue I keep wrestling with:\n\nWe're in the digital age now: your files will belong to you for a lifetime. When a program locks your files into a black or even gray box, it's guaranteed to be a short term solution - one day, you will have to recover your files from this program, whether it's self hosted or not.\n\nBetter to have an organization system for your own files and folders (whatever that looks like), and a program that non-destructively accepts and works with/hosts, than to lock your files into any kind of short term box.\n\n**Borderline cases:**\n\nA borderline program is Immich: intrinsically it's a gray box program - if you externally touch photos that have been uploaded to it, both you and Immich are totally screwed.\n\nBut it has the saving grace of accepting external libraries, which means it can function as a white box program. The one feature that would make Immich truly white-box is if it wrote metadata to the photos themselves (as much as possible), instead of keeping it all in a database. There are some write-back workarounds for this people are making, but it's not native.\n\n**Personal case:**\n\nAfter years of working on it, I finally came up with a personal organizational system that works for me. I know where to find anything I need - files, photos, media - on my computer.\n\nI wanted to up the ante last year by self hosting my files for mobile access. However, I started running into gray box issues - many programs demand I sacrifice my hard-won organizational structure for the modest convenience of a custom UI and tagging features.\n\nThis post is my attempt to think through the issue.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the thoughtful responses. \n\nOne nuance I'm getting is that different types of files store metadata in different ways and amounts, and need to be used in different ways. PDFs are used and shared in different ways than photos, so a program might have to do more heavy lifting in terms of meta-access to service PDFs than photos. Like versioning, sharing, tagging, etc. \n\nAlso, that software development is hard. I'm not a dev, but I sincerely appreciate the work that it takes. I support all open source development, even if a particular tool doesn't suit my own needs. Just hoping to add to the conversation with these ideas. \n\n(Fixed typos. Typos do show up when no AI is used)",

          "text": "While I agree withe the sentiment, I think there's two types of gray boxes, and one of them is much nastier than the other.\n\nExample 1, that you just gave, Paperless-ngx. Yes, it's true, changing files externally _is_ going to break things. I'm fine with that - Paperless is what I use to _store_ these files in the first place, and I don't want to care about them as file, but as documents. On the other hand, if I ever want to leave Paperless and adopt another solution, there's a lot of value in its metadata - I spent a lot of time tagging documents, and I don't want to lose that. Paperless has an exporter that gives you access to all of that in a well defined and usable format. I'm all good with that.\n\nExample 2, Booklore. Similarly, I want to think of my ebooks as just that - books. I don't particularly care about where they live on my hard drive or anything. It exposes them over standard protocols (e.g. OPDS), so I can easily access them anywhere. Great. Similarly to Paperless, when I add a new book, I spend a little bit of time making sure the metadata is correct. This adds up. And that's where things are very different - all of this is locked in the Booklore database. If I want to switch to a different software, I'm losing that. And that bothers me.",

They both organize and assign metadata to otherwise simple files, and want to handle storage layout for the data.  For some use cases, you want to use both programs for actually using and consuming the data.  You might pull out one file to use externally but for the files themselves you generally ingest them once and never move them around.  This is true even with the same data in flat folders with no software.",

Or at least only use it for archiving files I don't need to touch, like receipts. \n\nAudiobookshelf is a white box program that's working out very well. (I opted to store the metadata and cover in the books' folders - perfect) In fact, it's an example of a program that actually encouraged me to clean up my cluttered audiobook folder for it to read.

I actually have it import and organize my photos for me because my NAS photo upload app isn't so great, but it can actually work in a \"white box\" mode if you just point it at an organized set of folders. It also will scan and update it's metadata index if you [edit files externally](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/library/metadata/#external-changes). Might be worth a look for you.\n\nI've seen more mention of Audiobookshelf lately. I just recently set up Storyteller to serve books and audio books since it even syncs between the two. The problem is that I manage my books in Calibre, which is very opinionated about it's structure.

I run a home server with Plex, Transmission, and a bunch of other services, and the media side is where I've been luckiest with white box behavior.\n\nMy movie and TV library lives in plain folders on a big drive — Plex reads the structure, but if Plex dies tomorrow, my files are still there, named sensibly, ready for Jellyfin or whatever comes next. That's the white box dream.\n\nBut notes and documents are where it falls apart. Joplin stores everything in a SQLite blob. Notion is a cloud black box. Even Nextcloud gets gray-boxy once you rely on its calendar, contacts, or tasks — that data lives in its database, not on your filesystem.\n\nThe Obsidian example is perfect — plain markdown files on disk, organized however you want. I keep all my notes and project docs as markdown files synced with git, and it's incredibly freeing knowing I could switch editors tomorrow without losing anything.\n\nI think the key insight is that metadata portability matters as much as file portability. Having your photos on disk means nothing if all your tags, albums, and face recognition data are locked in an app-specific database with no export path. The best gray box apps at least give you a solid export — Paperless's exporter is a good example of doing the gray box thing responsibly.",

          "text": "I used to work for a software firm whose product automated web servers. A nice, user-friendly UI offered comprehensible ways of managing server functions, and the gross details of the configuration files were left to our product. When a user requested a change, the relevant config file(s) would be rewritten from scratch, using carefully-wrought templates and a store of data for filling the templates in. It worked beautifully.\n\nExcept, something like 15 years prior, someone decided that a smart admin should be able to edit the config themselves and the templates and data store should be updated automatically.\n\nBy the time I got there, the script doing this magic was around 9000 lines of code, and absolutely nobody in the company wanted to touch it. We took to warning our customers never to actually use this script, but unfortunately, there were parts of the product that would edit the configuration directly and then run this script, because the team writing that feature didn't want to bother thinking about templates and stores of data. Just do a quick s///; and invoke the dreaded 9000-line script, and everything will work.\n\nEverything did not work, but the team doing most of these jobs did not care. It was not theirs to clean up. They could just throw code over the wall, and it became someone else's problem.\n\nIf I'm understanding your thesis correctly, we were trying to be both a gray and a white box. The result was garbage.\n\n\\----\n\nOver the years, several attempts have been made to make operating systems friendlier, or at least more gnostic of the data they're storing. (Microsoft Bob and BeOS/Haiku are the two I know of.) I think it's a good idea, overall. My pipe dream is to have file extensions replaced with MIME types stored in the filesystem's metadata. A set of relational databases would gradually liberate metadata from files, leaving just a pointer to a binary blob. At the OS level, you could run a SELECT statement to find every MP3 file that Alan Parsons helped engineer, or every picture that was taken inside a national park, or every configuration option relevant to programs that use TCP and aren't part of the operating system. Whatever.\n\nI am pretty sure that 99.99% of users would not be smart enough to use this system. Just getting someone's head wrapped around a relational database is hard. I'll be honest; I've never written a JOIN statement myself. I just pile WHERE clauses on the end. I'm a bad DBA.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think the best solution that we can actually sustain is to white-box everything, and have applications do the best they can with the hand we deal them.\n\nThanks for giving me something to read that wasn't written by an AI. It felt good.",

You managed to put into words something that was on my mind for many years but that I couldn't quite describe.\n\nMany applications are web apps nowadays, selfhosted, cloud or smartphone app, they don't have access to some directory structure somewhere, they build their own. They have their database and their files. They are supposed to be sandboxes, but that also means their data lives alone.\n\nI really like \"white box\". I have a folder structure that has grown organically and been re-organized over and over since 1993. I don't want an application that thinks it owns my PDFs. My PDFs belong in the folder structure. Many \"normal\" desktop applications work that way: they edit the file I tell them to and when I close the application, the application is gone and if the file is in an open format, I can use another application tomorrow.\n\nI love Obsidian (you mentioned it) for that reason: I could throw it away tomorrow and my files are still fully usable. I will also transition from Nextcloud to Syncthing this year for this reason.\n\nWhen selecting an application, I often try to find out how it handles this, it is often not described. As a big fan of FOSS I often thought it did not go far enough: I want FOSS + standardized file formats + work on my folder structure. Worst case: if it's FOSS and stores everything in a SQLite database, theoretically I could read the code to find out how that database works, but that's not really my goal.\n\nMaybe we should create a directory specifically of white box applications?\n\nEdit/PS: I think many people don't care or are specifically searching for \"black box\", because their mental model is *not* \"my directory structure, my files\", their mental model is: \"these are the photos, they are in the photos app; and that over there are the PDFs, they are in the PDF app\". \n\nI think white box is superior, especially as one gets older and had to switch apps a couple of times. It's really painful if data is not in a standard format.",

It's really painful if data is not in a standard format. \n\nIn an ideal world, I disagree. If services can register themselves as providers for specific types of documents, the only generation that will prefer white box software are people who grew up with computers before smartphones got popular. Virtually nobody actually _wants_ to manage file - what people want is ensuring sovereignty of their own data (and associated metadata). If on one side you have Immich and on the other side you have your folder structure, and need to find a specific photo, chances are going through Immich will be much faster and much more natural - you can approach this from different angles (\"When was this photo taken?\" \"What was the event?\" \"Who is in this photo?\"), whereas your folder structure would likely give you at most one of those approaches.\n\nSwitching from black box to black box doesn't _have_ to be impossible. It just is because there's rarely a standard allowing to do so. Nothing prevents the maintainers of Immich (to keep that example) to work with the maintainers of e.g. Photoprism and working out an API allowing bi-directional migration - which could in turn become a standard for photo collection import/export.",

In my my experience a file structure organization is the most likely to survive the test of time. \n\nFile structure might be limited but when it comes to a migration you are literately dragging and dropping your files into where ever you want your files to live, and you are done. You have exactly what you had before. That is basically accessible to everyone, my grandma could do that. \n\n \n>Nothing prevents the maintainers of Immich (to keep that example) to work with the maintainers of e.g. Photoprism and working out an API allowing bi-directional migration - which could in turn become a standard for photo collection import/export.\n\nIf that is true then why hasn't it be done yet? \n\nThe reality is migration programs requires someone the write, test and maintain them. That takes time and effort to do. And generally the migration program needs to be specific to the program you are migrating from and program you are migrating two. \n\nThe most standardized way for a migration is for a database system is to export the metadata into a csv file and tweak the file to conform to whatever the new program is expecting for import. But that assumes the program your leaving can export csv and the program you are moving to can import csv. And that isn't exactly user friendly way of doing things. I have done some migrations of database and it can be a project to get all of the data organized and sorted. Not as simple as dragging and dropping some files.",

The design choice to use a database is for speed, indexing, and relational efficiency - not necessarily to keep the data proprietary. I suppose the other thing you may be implying is portability, I.e. the data goes wherever the photos go. And yes that is simpler to maintain. The compromise could be the database files goes with the photos - like a sql lite *.db file stored in the same folder.",

What I have in mind now is importing directly into paperless from my phone scan app and just syncing the media folder (or whichever it was with the nice folder structure paperless creates) into the Drive folder once a day or so with rsync.\n\nSo in the end it should look like Drive -> Documents -> \\[year\\] -> \\[correspondent\\] -> 2026-01-27 Invoice Whatever.pdf. The directories aren't final yet, since I have the feeling that getting rid of the first \\[year\\] level might make manual browsing/searching easier. Thinking about including tags too into the file names...\n\nThat way I can use paperless as long as it works/I've got enough motivation for the hobby but if anything would happen, the files are there and easily accessible. I had phases already were I was kind of burnt out from needing to support everything and minimized stuff down to just some core services (paperless was one of the first to go). Another case which hopefully won't happen soon is me getting run over by a bus or any other way one could die and someone else might need access to documents.\n\nMost if not all people I know aren't even interested in tech enough to use a dedicated password manager... (Thankfully Googles/Apples password vault is used, at least in many cases, if someone asks for some kind of support from time to time... I'd never use them myself but I'm thankful). I try to keep some basic instructions up to date for the case they are needed but I don't trust any of the people in my life in that regard. The filesystem is easy enough though and the most important documents are still on paper too.",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nSo I've been on GitHub for years and it's been fine for individual repos. But lately I feel like I'm fighting it more than using it. I have multiple projects, each with several repos, and I end up creating mirror repos and orgs just to keep things organized. It works, but it feels like duct tape.\n\nI've been reading about GitLab CE, Gitea, Forgejo... and honestly the feature comparison tables are everywhere. What I can't find are real takes from people who actually live with these tools daily.\n\nSome things I'm genuinely curious about:\n\n* **GitLab self-hosted:** Is it worth it for a solo dev / tiny team? Or does it eat too many resources for what you get? I've seen people say it needs 4-8GB RAM minimum and that scares me a bit for a one-person setup.\n* **Gitea vs Forgejo:** Anyone switched from one to the other? Forgejo's non-profit governance sounds great on paper but I care more about \"does it just work day to day.\"\n* **Hybrid setups:** Do any of you keep GitHub for public/open-source stuff and self-host for private work? How annoying is that in practice?\n* **Or just pay GitHub Teams?** Sometimes I wonder if I'm overcomplicating this. At what point did self-hosting actually make sense for you?\n\nA bit about me: full-stack freelancer, comfortable managing my own servers (already on Hetzner). I actually enjoy setting up CI/CD and configuring projects properly from day one — that's not the pain point. The thing is my projects keep growing, more repos, more services, and GitHub's free org model just doesn't scale well for keeping everything tidy. I need something where project organization and repo grouping actually makes sense without hacks.\n\nWould love to hear what actually surprised you after using these tools for a while. Not the marketing pages, the real stuff. Thanks!\n\n\\---\n\n# UPDATE:\n\nWow, this blew up way more than I expected, never had anything like this before! I can't keep up with all the responses today haha, this took way more time than I thought but I've learned SO much. I'll try to reply to more comments later tonight or tomorrow between breaks, but in the meantime here's what I'm taking away from all of this:\n\n\\- Forgejo/Gitea are the clear winners for solo devs and small teams. Almost everyone agrees.\n\n\\- GitLab is powerful but overkill for my case. 4-8GB RAM just to exist is too much when Forgejo runs on 100MB.\n\n\\- Woodpecker seems to be the go-to CI/CD if Gitea/Forgejo Actions don't cut it.\n\n\\- Discovered rclone for automated docker volume backups and gitea-mirror to automatically backup GitHub repos. Both new to me.\n\n\\- Gitea/Forgejo DO support auto-close issues on merge, which was one of my concerns.\n\n\\- The whole thing fits on a single Hetzner box with docker-compose.\n\nMy plan: setting up Forgejo + Woodpecker on my Hetzner server this week. Will probably share how it goes in a follow-up post.\n\nThanks everyone, 236 comments, 303 upvotes and 167K views on my first real post is absolutely insane. This community is incredible. Learned more here than in hours of reading comparison articles. Follow-up post coming soon once I have Forgejo running on my Hetzner box.",

The issue tracking is pretty good with milestones, labels, due dates, time tracking, everything you need. \n\nThey have also implemented Actions now, but didnt have the time to properly test it so far. \n\nOverall, I would easilly recommend it, for its simplicity.

When I push this branch to GitLab, it automatically connects it to the issue and if I make an merge request for it, it will automatically close the issue on merge. I never firgured out how to do this with Gitea/Forgejo.\n\nI also like that GitLab has independent number ranges for  merge requests and issues (and independent ways of linking to them, # for issue, ! for merge request). Thats completely subjective of curse, but for me it is more organized this way.",

For configuration you have the option to use Gitea’s app.ini or env vars if you use Docker.\n\nFor a small/medium business it can be good because it supports OAuth2.0 and SSO, but as a solo dev you can also skip it. I used Authentik and it works, it’s just a pain managing OIDC across a bunch of apps for a single user :(. One observation was importing SSH keys from FreeIPA -> Authentik -> Gitea did not work. Keys get imported but they’re not like…valid or something so I couldn’t use SSH repo cloning without adding keys through the UI\n\nMy pain points were trying to go from a VM install to a docker install, then a rootless docker install. In v1.25.3 the rootless container doesn’t work, something is wrong with the user configuration. Cannot speak to if this is resolved in 1.25.4.\n\nLast , I have heard that the Helm chart works but Gitea was not optimized to be a K8s application, so things like the Gitea cronjobs don’t have a shared state across multiple containers so you end up with a lot of duplicated effort",

                  "text": "Side note should you choose GitLab: go with a full-blown VM and put Docker on it, do NOT use an LXC + Docker combination. While most smaller apps run perfectly fine under LXC + Docker, GitLab is very, very nitpicky about RAM:\n- No ballooning! GitLab (or more specifically Puma and Sidekiq) runs best when it knows that its RAM never changes during runtime\n- Give it enough RAM, but not too much. Start with 2 GB and up it 1 GB at a time (cold OS reboots!) and test each amount until GitLab is happy and behaves as expected. Account for the VM overhead of course \n- Set \"stop_grace_period\" of the Compose to at least 2 minutes, otherwise there will be data corruption happening when Docker kills GitLab midway through some database (finalization) operations \n\nWhy a VM?\n- LXCs do not \"have RAM\", they do not even know what RAM is or how to handle it (in layman's terms). LXCs share the host (Proxmox etc) kernel, and only THAT kernel has knowledge about the actual RAM. All the LXC does is provide a namespaced Linux environment inside of another Linux environment. The LXC and applications running in that environment request RAM directly via the host's kernel.\n- Depending on how the application is written and which mechanism is chosen to get the amount of \"currently free RAM\", it can be a hit or miss with LXCs. In simpler terms it's the output of the \"free\" command versus the output of \"cat /proc/meminfo\" and others. See below\n- In contrast, VMs actually do \"have RAM\" because there's another kernel running that is handling the \"quota\" given by kvm/qemu which only allows that kernel to see whatever quota you have set. The VM only has that amount of RAM set and that's it. It's the upper limit for any application running inside the VM.\n\nWhat does a that have to do with GitLab or generally Docker? Well, LXCs and Docker both share common concepts but handle things quite differently. The kernel stuff gets really weird when it comes to RAM. Try it: Run an LXC and check free memory using \"free\" and \"cat /proc/meminfo\" directly on that LXC. You should see the amount that YOU have set. Then run an interactive Docker container inside that LXC and run the 2 commands again. At least of them will show the wrong value - the WHOLE system RAM.\nMeaning for GitLab: Running GitLab as a Docker container inside an LXC container effectively bypasses the LXC RAM quota thing, because Docker does it differently and also directly talks to the host's kernel in its own way, thus making GitLab believe it having access to the amount of RAM the WHOLE system has, not just the LXC, while at the same time having RAM quotas set.\n\nExample: You have a Proxmox host with 16 GB of RAM. You create an LXC with 6 GB RAM and install Docker in there to run GitLab:\n- LXC sees 6 GB RAM and only allows the Docker engine to consume that much\n- Docker sees 16 GB and does NOT know about the LXC quota of 6 GB, because it doesn't know that it's running on top of LXC and currently there's no way to tell Docker that (kernel stuff)\n- GitLab sees what Docker sees and will happily fill up the LXC until the Out of Memory Killer kicks in and your LXC is left in an undefined state basically.\n\nIn short: both technologies (LXC and Docker) talk to the host's kernel in their own ways, but if you put Docker on top of LXC, there is no way that Docker can check that or is capable of changing its behavior accordingly. Hence nobody (specifically Proxmox) actually officially supports running Docker on top of LXCs.\n\nThat was s long side note xD sry bout that",

It’s very much a “live what you do for work” mentality. It’s complex and a little chunky at 8gb ram. I’m not running it in cloud but on my own cluster so 8gb is nothing to me but very expensive when you’re putting it in cloud. It’s a drawback but it has a lot of cool enterprise features for $0.00. \n\nGitea in a LXC or docker container is so stupid simple and so nice. When I have weird projects that are one offs I use gitea to not turn my gitlab into a trash fire. I also use gitea replicated to my gitlab and a gitea instance in a cloud provider for emergencies so if I need to recover my environments from a total loss it’s cheap and easy.",

So far 143 comments, 25 upvotes and 59K views, thank you all seriously!\n\nAfter reading everything, here's what I'm taking away:\n\n\\- Forgejo/Gitea are the clear winners for solo devs and small teams. Almost everyone agrees.\n\n\\- GitLab is powerful but overkill for my case. 4-8GB RAM just to exist is too much when Forgejo runs on 100MB.\n\n\\- Woodpecker seems to be the go-to CI/CD if Gitea/Forgejo Actions don't cut it.\n\n\\- Discovered rclone for automated docker volume backups and gitea-mirror to automatically backup GitHub repos. Both new to me.\n\n\\- Gitea/Forgejo DO support auto-close issues on merge, which was one of my concerns.\n\n\\- The whole thing fits on a single Hetzner box with docker-compose.\n\nMy plan: setting up Forgejo + Woodpecker on my Hetzner server this week. Will probably share how it goes in a follow-up post.\n\nThanks everyone, this was my first real post and the quality of answers here is incredible. Learned more in one thread than in hours of reading comparison articles.",
