You might change some of that as needed to customise the setup.\n\nSo just imagine it as equivalent to setting up a VM with the app from a single file, except it's a container(a) instead (unless on Windows / macOS, then docker tends to run containers within a VM).",

Granted back then I imagine it was easier to find uncompressed and high quality photo to analyse... Anyway I'm always confused when I see this guy labelled as TPB founder with no solid confirmation when the entire context suggests he's Polish.\n\nYou missed one big obvious clue btw, you can include it for future use... Box branded with Mamut logo (known for their sucharki and other bread products) above Fizjologia book, below the partially disassembled speaker. It's their old logo. For reference: https://dodomku.pl/images/products/full/00045252.jpg\n\nEdit to add: I also remember that the chocolate package between two lower laptops was easily identified, although I can't remember the brand now...",

      "text": "Today, after raising security concerns in a post on r/huntarr regarding the lack of development standards in what looks like a 100% vibe-coded project, I was banned. This made my spidey senses tingle, so I decided to do a security review of the codebase. What I found was... not good. TLDR: If you have Huntarr exposed on your stack, anyone can pull your API keys for Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, and every other connected app without logging in, gaining full control over your media stack.\n\n# The process\n\nI did a security review of Huntarr.io (v9.4.2) and found critical auth bypass vulnerabilities. I'm posting this here because Huntarr sits on top of (and is now trying to replace them as well!) Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, and other *arr apps that have years of security hardening behind them. If you install Huntarr, you're adding an app with zero authentication on its most sensitive endpoints, and that punches a hole through whatever network security you've set up for the rest of your stack.\n\n**The worst one:** `POST /api/settings/general` requires no login, no session, no API key. Nothing. Anyone who can reach your Huntarr instance can rewrite your entire configuration and the response comes back with **every setting for every integrated application** in cleartext. Not just Huntarr's own proxy credentials - the response includes API keys and instance URLs for Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Lidarr, Readarr, Whisparr, and every other connected app. One curl command and an attacker has direct API access to your entire media stack:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST http://your-huntarr:9705/api/settings/general \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"proxy_enabled\": true}'\n```\n\nFull config dump with passwords and API keys for every connected application. If your instance is internet-facing - and it often is, Huntarr incorporates features like Requestarr designed for external access - anyone on the internet can pull your credentials without logging in.\n\n**Other findings (21 total across critical/high/medium):**\n\n- **Unauthenticated 2FA enrollment on the owner account** (Critical, **proven in CI**): `POST /api/user/2fa/setup` with no session returned the actual TOTP secret and QR code for the owner account. An attacker generates a code, calls `/api/user/2fa/verify`, enrolls their own authenticator. Full account takeover, no password needed.\n- **Unauthenticated setup clear enables full account takeover** (Critical, **proven in CI**): `POST /api/setup/clear` requires no auth. Returns 200 \"Setup progress cleared.\" An attacker re-arms the setup flow, creates a new owner account, replaces the legitimate owner entirely.\n- **Unauthenticated recovery key generation** (Critical, **proven in CI**): `POST /auth/recovery-key/generate` with `{\"setup_mode\": true}` reaches business logic with no auth check (returns 400, not 401/403). The endpoint is unauthenticated.\n- **Full cross-app credential exposure** (Critical, **proven in CI**): Writing a single setting returns configuration for 10+ integrated apps. One call, your entire stack's API keys.\n- **Unauthenticated Plex account unlink** - anyone can disconnect your Plex from Huntarr\n- **Auth bypass on Plex account linking** via client-controlled `setup_mode` flag - the server skips session checks if you send `{\"setup_mode\": true}`\n- **Zip Slip arbitrary file write** (High): `zipfile.extractall()` on user-uploaded ZIPs without filename sanitization. The container runs as root.\n- **Path traversal in backup restore/delete** (High): `backup_id` from user input goes straight into filesystem paths. `shutil.rmtree()` makes it a directory deletion primitive.\n- `local_access_bypass` trusts `X-Forwarded-For` headers, which are trivially spoofable - combine with the unauth settings write and you get full access to protected endpoints\n\n**How I found this:** Basic code review and standard automated tools (bandit, pip-audit). The kind of stuff any maintainer should be running. The auth bypass isn't a subtle bug - `auth.py` has an explicit whitelist that skips auth for `/api/settings/general`. It's just not there.\n\n**About the maintainer and the codebase:**\n\nThe maintainer [says](https://i.imgur.com/sjPAT1u.png) they have \"a series of steering documents I generated that does cybersecurity checks and provides additional hardening\" and **\"Note I also work in cybersecurity.\"** They [say](https://i.imgur.com/8AkHZ27.png) they've put in \"120+ hours in the last 4 weeks\" using \"steering documents to advise along the way from cybersecurity, to hardening, and standards\". If that's true, it's not showing in the code.\n\nIf you work in cybersecurity, you should know not to whitelist your most sensitive endpoint as unauthenticated. You should know that returning TOTP secrets to unauthenticated callers is account takeover. You should know `zipfile.extractall()` on untrusted input is textbook Zip Slip. This is introductory stuff. The \"cybersecurity steering documents\" aren't catching what a basic security scan flags in seconds.\n\nLook at the [commit history](https://i.imgur.com/TomsJz0.png): dozens of commits with messages like \"Update\", \"update\", \"Patch\", \"change\", \"Bug Patch\" - hundreds of changed files in commits separated by a few minutes. No PR process, no code review, no second pair of eyes - just raw trunk-based development where 50 features get pushed in a day with zero review. Normal OSS projects are slower for a reason: multiple people look at changes before they go in. Huntarr has none of that.\n\nWhen [called out on this](https://i.imgur.com/dF0Oyst.png), the maintainer said budget constraints: \"With a limited budget, you can only go so far unless you want to spend $1000+. I allot $40 a month in the heaviest of tasks.\" That's just not true - you can use AI-assisted development 8 hours a day for $20/month. The real problem isn't the budget. It's that the maintainer doesn't understand the security architecture they're building and doesn't understand the tools they're using to build it. You can't guide an AI to implement auth if you don't recognize what's wrong when it doesn't.\n\n**They also censor security reports and ban people who raise concerns.** A user posted security concerns on r/huntarr and it was [removed by the moderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/huntarr/comments/1rbtri7/removed_by_moderator/) - the maintainer controls the subreddit. I was banned from r/huntarr after pointing out these issues in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/huntarr/comments/1rccfcd/huntarr_94_released_user_requests_bundling/) where the maintainer was claiming to work in cybersecurity (which they now deleted).\n\nOne more thing - the project's README has a \"Support - Building My Daughter's Future\" section soliciting donations. That's a red flag for me. You're asking people to fund your development while shipping code with 21 unpatched security vulnerabilities, no code review process, and banning people who point out the problems, while doing an appeal to emotion about your daughter. If you need money, that's fine - but you should be transparent about what you're spending it on and you should be shipping code that doesn't put your users at risk.\n\n**Proof repo with automated CI:** https://github.com/rfsbraz/huntarr-security-review\n\nDocker Compose setup that pulls the published Huntarr image and runs a Python script proving each vulnerability. GitHub Actions runs it on every push - check the workflow results yourself or run it locally with `docker compose up -d && python3 scripts/prove_vulns.py`.\n\nFor what it's worth, and to prove I'm not an AI hater, the `prove_vulns` script itself was vibe coded - I identified the vulnerabilities through code review, wrote up the repro steps, and had AI generate the proof script.\n\nFull security review (21 findings): https://github.com/rfsbraz/huntarr-security-review/blob/main/Huntarr.io_SECURITY_REVIEW.md\n\n**What happens next:** The maintainer will most likely prompt these problems away - feed the findings to an AI and ship a patch. But fixing 21 specific findings doesn't fix the process that created them. No code review, no PR process, no automated testing, no one who understands security reviewing what ships. The next batch of features will have the next batch of vulnerabilities. This is only the start. If the community doesn't push for better coding standards, controlled development, and a sensible roadmap, people will keep running code that nobody has reviewed.\n\nIf you're running Huntarr, keep it off any network you don't fully trust until this is sorted. The *arr apps it wraps have their own API key auth - Huntarr bypasses that entirely.\n\nPlease let others know about this. If you have a Huntarr instance, share this with your community. If you know someone who runs one, share it with them. The more people know about the risks, the more pressure there will be on the maintainer to fix them and improve their development process.\n\nEdit: Looks like r/huntarr went private and the repo got deleted or privated https://github.com/plexguide/Huntarr.io . I'm sorry for everyone that donated to this guy's \"Daughter College Fund\".\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the love on the comments, I'll do my best to reach out to everyone I can. People asking me for help on security reviews, believe me when I say I did little more than the basics - the project was _terrible_.",

All while having superficial Go knowledge (my most exp is Java).\n\nBut at the end of the day they're my own images, built for myself, to standards that I have set - distroless, rootless, as few deps as I reasonably can, auto-update for upstream, and with CI and at least some essential tests. They should never be exposed publicly. If anyone else wants to use any of these - more than welcome, but they're built for myself.\n\nAnd hey, if anyone wants to scrutinize, especially the security - I'll appreciate the free feedback.",

Ports from applications aren't exposed to the host but are available to Nginx so all traffic to an application must go through Nginx.\n\n0 - Only exposed to my own VLAN\n1 - Exposed to myself and my family\n2 - Exposed to all network users\n3 - Exposed publicly\n\nJellyfin will be in level 3 but Huntarr is in level 1.

Someone would either have to make Nginx ignore my trusted access list or find a way to get an IP in my VLAN before they could exploit one of these vulnerabilities.\n\nThis is a super simple measure to add to any application to immediately reduce your risk.",

The entire architecture, design decisions, and core foundations were all built without any AI involvement. I only recently began using AI to speed up feature releases and streamline workflows.\n\nI don't blindly accept AI-generated code either. Every line gets reviewed before it's committed. I've got 12+ years of software engineering experience across a wide range of domains, so I'm pretty particular about what makes it into the codebase.\n\nAnd look, AI isn't going anywhere. I genuinely believe it's the future of software development, but only when it's in the hands of experienced engineers who actually understand what they're building.\n\nIf you want to do a security audit, go for it! I'm confident in the app. I believe someone already did a pen test and it came back clean. Always happy to have more eyes on it though!\n\nEdit: Also just curious, what gave you the impression that Booklore is vibe coded?",

I raised a question on Discord and was told that wasn't what Huntarr was meant to do (even though it was literally in the description). So, based off what it was originally meant to do, it only did 2/3rds of that yet spent more time building and connecting new additions and features trying to overtake then entire media server stack as an all in one utility.  If someone wants to build out an all in one, that's fine and dandy,  but IMO if you're going to claim your project does one thing, make sure it does that one thing before adding the bells and whistles. Huntarr's downfall is because the dev wanted to put too much in to it too quickly and left a bunch of doors open in the process. In the short amount of time I knew about it jumped from just being announced to version 9.x.x. Thats a red flag for me. Too fast too quickly. Software typically takes years between versions and here he's versioning up almost twice a month.",

This is a great case study in use of Agentic AI for software development, was he entirely in the wrong, I think not, could he have maybe learned from his mistakes if his ego didn't get the best of him probably.\n\nNow to call out what his tool did well in, his original intentions of solving the gap of the Arr tools relying on RSS feeds and not having support to regularly check for potential upgrades to media.  This brings to light a simple but technically challenging feature set that I my self had on my backlog for my personal tool to replace the Arr stack.  Perhaps this is a feature Seerr or another Arr tool will take notice of and consider solving with the existing foundations in place.\n\nNow I feel even more motivated to continue the work on my side project to get it up to par with existing Arr tools...",

I hold nothing against their business personally and I am always more than happy to comply with reasonable demands (like removing trademarked name parts from project), but I don't think the exporter is against the rules (I have my own logic for fair business practice) and now the CEO wants to meet for a quick call (I hope friendly), to discuss and reason things out. I need to present my points fairly as well and don't want to get pressured/voiced down, just because I am alone with my logic. I am sure as a company with > 1 million $ revenue they have a larger backing.**\n\n⚠️⚠️ I am already in chat with u/Archiver_test4 as a legal representative, but we are in a different time zone. If anyone else in addition would like to take a look to help me, present their view, or get involved, I am more than happy to talk and get some feedback on how can I present my idea (reach out only If you are a lawyer, but please note I am not in a position to pay any fees). It's best if you have knowledge of EU legal rules and data protection policy, GDPR etc. Please reach out to me as this is the right time to make the reasoning and requests. feel free to email me to [contact@opendronelog.com](mailto:contact@opendronelog.com) or send me a chat here. I might not reply until morning, as it's quite late here now.\n\nNone of these would have happened only if they sent me this same email before sending the letter.\n\n[The Unfair competition clause I mentioned.](https://preview.redd.it/pg9lktdte4lg1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5c70d0bc7f404477fab42be7e8aab2cbb32725)\n\n[Some demands](https://preview.redd.it/jo3nz51s0alg1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7a65c260432e94cb1c6c08ea495cce0322f6c06)\n\n💜💜 Thanks to the r/drones and r/selfhosted and r/opensource community we were able to reach to this stage in record time. As in individual, you can voice your opinion. It proved again that what opensource communities can do and this thread is a living proof of that.\n\n\\--------\n\n**TL;DR:** I made an [open-source, local-first dashboard for drone flight logs](https://opendronelog.com) because the biggest corporate player in the space locks your older data behind a paywall. They found my GitHub, tracked my Reddit posts, and hit me with a legal notice for \"unfair competition\" and trademark infringement.\n\n**Long version:** I maintain a few small open-source projects. About two weeks ago, I released a free, self-hostable tool that lets drone pilots collect, map, and analyze their flight logs locally. I didn't think much of it, just a passion project with a few hundred users.\n\nI can’t name the company (let's call them \"Company A\") because their legal team is actively monitoring my Reddit account and cited my past posts in their notice. Company A is the giant in this space. Their business model goes like this:\n\n* You can upload unlimited flight logs for free.\n* BUT you can only view the last 100 flights.\n* If you want to see your older data, you have to pay a monthly subscription *and* a $15 \"retrieval fee.\"\n* Even then, you can't bulk download your own logs. You have to click them one by one. They effectively hold your own data hostage to lock you into their ecosystem. I am not sure if they are even GDPR complaint even in the EU\n\nTo help people transition to my open-source tool, I wrote a simple web-based script that allowed users to log into their own Company A accounts and automate the bulk download of their own files. Company A did not like this. They served me with a highly aggressive, 4-page legal demand (CEASE and DESIST notice). They forced me to:\n\n1. Nuke the automated download tool entirely from GitHub.\n2. Remove any mention of their company name from my main open-source project and website (since it’s trademarked). I originally had my tagline as \"The Free open-source \\[Company A\\] Alternative,\" which they claimed was illegally driving their traffic to my site.\n3. Remove a feature comparison chart I made. (I admittedly messed up here, I only compared my free tool to their paid tier and omitted their limited free tier, which they claimed was misleading and defamatory).\n\nI'm just a solo dev, so I complied with the core of their demands to stay out of trouble. I scrubbed their name, took down the downloader, and sanitized my website. My main open-source logbook lives independent of them.\n\nI admit I was naive about the legal aspects of comparison marketing and using trademarked names. But the irony is that they probably spent thousands of dollars on lawyer fees to draft a threat against my small project that makes close to zero money (I got a few small donations from happy users).\n\nHas anyone else here ever dealt with corporate lawyers coming after your self-hosted/FOSS projects? It’s a crazy initiation :)\n\n**EDIT : Lot of people think the company is DJI, it's NOT DJI. I love their drones and their customer service. It's not them.**",

However, the point of a cease and desist is to effect the company’s goal, regardless of the legal merit of their arguments or whether the lawyer would dare making such a claim in front of a judge.\n\nIt is definitely not in the public interest that this bluster has impeded your ability to compete with their unusual rent-seeking model that is based on throttling their customers’ access to their own personally generated data from flights they commanded. Because it is an open source product that you do for your own enjoyment rather than monetary gain, I don’t know if you can seek damages as a result of them impeding your ability to distribute your product, but their might be similar cases that have occurred with other open source products.",

If the situation were reversed, the company would not hesitate to smear you in the media.  Just look up the McDonalds hot coffee spill case.  They smeared an elderly woman in the media attempting to get off the hook for their intentional endangerment.  At that time, a corporate memo showed McDonalds policy dictating super-heating their coffee under pressure to above boiing temperature's so that customers would be unlikely to ask for a free refill.  Not surprisingly, handing paper cups of super-heated liquid to customers was not very safe.  And the result was 3rd degree burns to an 80 year old woman's labia.  Which had to be amputated and she almost died in the hospital.  But McDonalds spent millions on news propaganda making themselves the victim.  ",

A download tool may be ok but it depends on how it works. The US has vague laws about tools that circumvent security.

But family emergency happened and I had to leave home for a few weeks. Contacted courier and seller to try and arrange alternative collection but courier just left it on my doorstep out in the rain, eventually courier agreed to return to location to retrieve package and hold for me to collect on my return but it's now gone missing. Seller told me to do one as well as courier and eBay\n\nBut after appealing to eBAY UK, I eventually got my refund thankfully, but the prices have shot up again and now its going to cost me at least another additional £100 for the same pair if I can find them in stock. Just bloody marvellous.",

Even just a thought of it makes me noxious. So there should be some amount of freedom given to the kids, so they can learn to navigate the information landscape efficiently and effectively.

Firefox comes default with the Cira DoH [1] that was effectively bypassing my local DNS because the browser never used the system DNS resolver via port 53 instead it directly queried the DoH port 443 which got slipped through the cracks of firewall for good reasons lol (pun intended).\n\nNow when I block DoH servers from the firewall then the browser fell back to the old school DNS \n\nLinks:\n1. https://www.cira.ca/en/canadian-shield/configure/chrome/",

That's not to say there aren't problems with AI solutions. \n\nNamely:\n1. They tend not to scale well - AI is good at beelining for a working solution but doesn't have the human ability to intelligently optimize a design to be easy to work on in the future or performant (necessarily)\n2. They can suffer from deep security issues that you may not even be aware of (similar reasons to above)\n3. Fundamentally, you're missing out on the learning process of creating something and therefore both miss the opportunity to up skill and risk creating something you don't understand and therefore cannot support\n4. It's easy to very quickly pump out crap that looks passable on the surface, making it much harder overall to curate good software.\n\nBUT\n\nIf you're designing a simple app that doesn't need to scale or be secure (it's primarily designed for a simple internal usage and doesn't handle sensitive data), and if you're not interested/don't have time to really learn how to do something but just need a quick solution that doesn't exist already and aren't trying to market it as something that it isn't - *I do not see the issue in using this as a means to an end*. It solves a problem. It does something useful for OP. OP is honest about the use of AI and doesn't promise amazing support or market themselves as a great coder.

The \"approve gate\" approach solves the real problem - it's not about blocking YouTube entirely, it's about being the curator of what gets through during formative years.\n\nWhat strikes me is how much this aligns with the broader self-hosting philosophy: taking back control from systems designed to maximize engagement over wellbeing. YouTube's algorithm isn't malicious, but it IS single-mindedly focused on watch time. Building your own gatekeeping layer is exactly the kind of solution the self-hosted community excels at.\n\nThe Telegram integration for instant approval is smart UX - it keeps the friction low for the parent while maintaining the gate. And the channel allowlisting with time limits by category shows this was built from real parenting experience, not theoretical concerns.\n\nNice work on the security considerations too - non-root container, rate limiting, SSRF prevention. The \"vibe coded\" honesty is refreshing.",

Cheers to you for taking a problem and resolving it. If you do expand this apps capabilities would love to see other notification platforms like discord or signal.

People are acting like software written with AI assistance is somehow tainted, as if the CPU cares how the bytes were emotionally summoned into existence.\n\nNo one yells at a carpenter for using a hammer instead of a rock to drive a nail into a 2×4. No one accuses an electrician of cheating for using a voltage tester instead of licking the wire. Tools exist to remove unnecessary suffering.\n\nVIBE coding is just high-level intent expressed in human language, the same direction we’ve been moving for decades:\n            \n    assembly -> C\n    C -> higher-level languages\n    manual config -> automation\n    docs -> code generators\n            \nBut this is where we draw the line? Sure.\n\nIf the code is readable, auditable, reproducible, and runs locally under your control, then whining about how it was created is just fear of losing a gate to guard.\n\nYou don’t get bonus points for doing things the hard way. You get points for shipping something that works.",

That’s normal.\n\nVibe coding isn’t about avoiding learning — it’s about compressing the discovery phase. If I need something working today, spending a week digging through docs and Stack Overflow isn’t some moral victory. Time is money, and shipping matters.\n\nAlso, this idea that it’s “not faster” just doesn’t line up with reality. Getting a rough but functional implementation in minutes, then reading it, understanding it, and modifying it, is often far quicker than starting from a blank file. I still have to understand the code to maintain it — the learning happens either way.\n\nThe “commissioning an artist” analogy doesn’t really hold up either. Programming isn’t art — it’s engineering. If I specify requirements, constraints, inputs, outputs, and then validate, test, and integrate the result, that’s no different than using:\n\na framework\n\na code generator\n\na compiler\n\na boilerplate template\n\nNobody says you didn’t “really code” because you used requests instead of writing a TCP stack.\n\nAnd yes, learning Python is great — I do that constantly — but pretending the only valid way to learn is the slowest possible one is just romanticizing inefficiency. In the real world, professionals balance learning, tooling, and delivery.",

I was pretty impressed with the speed at which I could make it based on about 15-20 minutes of outline using the Plan mode in Cursor and then several iterations of testing and re-prompting.\n\nWell then I actually looked at the code and was pretty horrified. For example, It had generated two sets of sidebar code, one for the overall view, and one for when I was clicked on an image for display.\n\nI did ask a friend who uses these tools more regularly and he pointed out I needed to direct the AI to reuse code and create templates as often as possible, but I can absolutely see how someone just sleepwalking their way through generating an application could run into these sorts of issues. \n\nIt also is one of those cases where its the most dangerous when you don't know what to add to your outline/prompts to keep it controlled. But if you already know enough to ask that, then wouldn't you already be capable of writing it yourself? I suppose there's some arguments to be made about increasing your speed and then checking back later, but if junior/non-devs are going to use these tools in lieu of learning then they'll never know they'd need to watch out for these issues in the first place! Its a real chicken/egg problem.\n\nI think the best approach is one I've seen other engineers point out, which is to learn it the actual way and only when you're comfortable with writing these things yourself should you really dip into any sort of automated code generation, and even then keep it on a short leash. Its something I'm still struggling with applying, though I've gotten some pretty decent unit testing code out of it, even if I do have to read over each test and make sure they're *actually performing a test that can fail*.",

What AI does is increase code output in return for greatly increased technical debt. Unfortunately *reducing* that technical debt isn't faster than before.\n\n\nThis *feels* much faster at first, but as the technical debt becomes worse and worse the generated code becomes less and less reliable because the terrible code is so badly encapsulated that the AI cannot keep all the necessary parts in its limited context.  \n\n\nAs a result the number of bugs increases and you'll have angry users/customers yelling at you to fix it. At this point you have two options: fix the technical debt or abandon the project.\n\n\nBecause solo AI developers didn't actually have to put much work into building the project they usually end up choosing the latter, which is why so many vibecoded projects end up abandoned after 6-18 months.\n\n\nIf you choose the former you'll slow down *a lot* and in the end need to spend more time fixing the mess left by AI than it would have taken to just do it without AI in the first place.\n\n\nThe only people who are genuinely permanently more productive with it are those in big corporations offloading the technical debt on someone else. The company as a whole still suffers from it, though. Looking at you, Microslop.",

It’s safe enough living on my network but I don’t trust it public facing and it’s not fair to anyone else to even hint that it might be. I don’t understand the code, I only know it does what it supposed to and know that it’s probably one giant security vulnerability. But that’s not what this guy did. \n\nEspecially after misrepresenting themselves as a “security expert”, the whole thing feels scummy. Almost intentionally so. \n\nSo yeah, it’d be nice to have a sub to show off and share vibe coded shit with the understanding that the author has no idea what it’s doing behind the scene, and keep this sub for legit projects. (Not that any of us should be running anything we don’t understand, but at the same time there is peer review and the community does a good job of self policing to someone protect the people here are aren’t as tech savvy) \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",

That looks like a endpoint to exfiltrate data to me. I'm looking at it through the glasses of \"suspected malicious intent\". I just find it suspicious that they pulled the source code after the vulnerability became public instead of addressing the issue, as if they would be hiding something. Even if the app is not explicitly sending telemetry to expose the keys (which would be way more obvious to spot), it wouldn't be the first time that conscious mistakes were added into source code (There was one added to the Linux Kernel not long time ago, I don't have the name of it at hand right now) that came in form of deliberate buffer overflows (Way more sophisticated than this one). In any case, they might have been teenagers who just freaked out after the vibe coding backlash, but I'd still be curious of this strange behavior.",

Usually you will have to separate streams by resolution, so you dont stream 4k to a pc configured to receive 720p, meaning you have to buffer multiple times.

I'm sure if you have a small group of very employed, not that terminally online and non-stubborn people then moving everyone over to a Matrix based client would be fine to use as a group chat where you can get in a group call and play a game once a week. But for the people that use Discord like Discord I (sadly) don't think Element using Matrix is or will be a serious replacement.\n\n  \nI would like some form of decentralised self-host platform to win out though. I am not blindly hating on Matrix and did and still do want it to succeed but after trying to do this months ago it wasn't a fit. I just don't see how anything other than self hosted can be a real replacement for Discord because moving from one centralised service to another is not worth annoying your friends over.",

You can have 320kbps audio and 4k60 fps for free (might be more, depends on your system rigs and internet, Video streaming are p2p)\n\nOverall TeamSpeak 6 is good when you do not care about anything at all but a minimal app to just team and speak with your friends. Good audio and video quality,  file upload sucks, can't have more than 32 people.\n\nThat's it for now I guess, if you want a TRUE DISCORD experience then sadly there're none.

Could have been a library instead of a whole container, but ok. Let's make it a whole lot more complicated.\n\nAlso CORS. The documentation gives you an example nginx config with the whole CORS thing being a simple comment below. \"But Element is a desktop app. It wouldn't need that anyway. Also it's just a comment below and not included as part of the example config. So it's irrelevant. I'll just forget about it.\" So you copy it believing it's complete and end up troubleshooting the whole 3-container config structure ad nauseum until you realize you can just do ctrl+shift+i in the chromium tab that calls itself app to find out it's fucking CORS.\n\nThat CORS thing, and the multi-container config nightmare, and the push notification app requirement thing are three separate blunders that make an otherwise cool and exciting thing a very frustrating experience.",

Things like weight, height, steps etc are per day entries. so whichever is sync last will stay. but things like workout or exercise could become duplicate if same workout or exercise are sync from both fitbit & android app.\n\nLike if you text and email someone same info, it will be received by the receiver twice isn't it . so same issue here as well.

I cannot even find a simple tomato or a banana. All I get is a list of irrelevant things. \n\nAnother example: I want to add something as \"quick food\" because it's a one time meal and if I import the meal by using CSV setting the flag it's not added to my daily food, I cannot search it in the meals to add it manually afterwards, but it's still there because if I want to reimport the CSV it says there is already food with that title.\n\nSo what I want to say: Yes, the idea of a selfhosted MyFitnessPal is super cool and I love it.

Coding is a really important part in it, as everyone can imagine! The 'funny' thing is that coding takes up maybe 60-90% in the first stages (Depending on many many factors). However, after these stages, it can quickly shrink down to only take up 10-30% of the total work.\n\nSoftware Engineering is as much developer stuff, as is coordinating people (which also takes a hefty amount of social skills at a certain point), political stuff with stake holders, and architecturing something that's (according to your foresight) will be able to solve the issues you're facing today and tomorrow.\n\nAI may pose a major shift, like it hasn't happened since the switch from Assembly to higher languages like C. It's going to stay however, because it's actually good writing small-ish pieces of code - Yet again, look above, that's a surprisingly small part of the job.\n\nI'll leave it at that for this sub :)\n\nBut for what you should be concerned about: You're building that project for yourself first, and everyone else second. In fact, having many users in a open source project poses a dilemma many maintainers of major projects would love to be without. So, just continue, if just for yourself. And if someone likes your project, he'll give a star, maybe even contribute. And if not? Who cares, you did solve **your** issue :)",

Context matters, AI has no context. I use it for configuration and often it makes stuff up and when I ask for its sources (critical question) there are none. It often just makes up random syntax. In the wrong hands it's scary.  AI needs guidance. There is a place for mentors like this, both for AI and vibe coders.  Logically, vibe coding is great for prototypes and small use-cases where there is no wide-impact but scaling to something long lasting? It needs help. It's just a tool.

But the smarter crawlers rotate IPs and user agents constantly, so IP-based blocking only catches the lazy ones.\n\n  \nPoison fountains work on a completely different layer. The bot successfully crawls your site, thinks it got useful data, and feeds garbage into its training pipeline. By the time anyone notices, the damage is baked into the model weights.\n\n  \nI run both on my setup. CrowdSec with the community blocklist handles maybe 80% of the noise. The remaining 20% that gets through hits a tarpit with poisoned content served from a hidden path. The Anthropic research someone linked above is exactly why - even small amounts of bad data can wreck a dataset disproportionately.\n\n  \nOne thing worth adding: if you're using nginx, you can also check the robots.txt compliance first and only serve poison to bots that ignore it. That way legitimate crawlers (search engines etc) aren't affected.",

                  "text": "As far as I can tell the study focused on Bitwarden, Lastpass and Dashlane because the source code was (partially) available and they are the most popular password mangers (apart from platform integrated ones from Google, Apple, etc.). They only performed an \"initial analysis\" of 1Password in the appendix. According to the key hierarchy in the paper it uses RSA-OAEP to store the vault key without any authentication of the ciphertext. The study describes a vault substitution attack exploiting this which allows a malicious server to replace your vault with completely attacker controlled data and allows the attacker to obtain any secrets stored in the vault after the attack. The impact of this attack is in my opinion worse than a combination of two attacks on Bitwarden (BW08 and BW11) and is even simpler than the corresponding Bitwarden attacks. The lack of authentication of (public) keys for vault sharing features is the source for a lot of the vulnerabilities in Bitwarden, Lastpass and Dashlane and is also present in 1Password (even ackknowledged in their security whitepaper). So while the study seems to not have investigated this issue in depth like for the other password managers, I think it is very likely that similar attacks are also possible in 1Password since the underlying issue is also present there. While Bitwarden for example has implemented mitigations for these attacks and is working on implementing key authentication, 1Password considers these attacks to be \"arising from already known architectural limitations\" and seems to not be interested in improving this. \n\nSo I think the lack of findings for 1Password is not because their security architecture and key hierarchy is better (imo it is significantly worse due to the use of RSA instead of authenticated AES for your own vault key) but rather because the study did not investigate 1Password in depth like the others because it is closed source, less popular and aware of the issues already (but not fixing it).",

Running it in Docker takes about 5 minutes and uses minimal resources — I've had mine running on a Pi for over a year with zero issues.\n\nThe real security analysis people should be doing isn't \"which cloud provider do I trust more\" but \"what's my actual threat model?\" For most people, the biggest risk isn't a sophisticated attack on their password manager's encryption — it's phishing, credential reuse, and not using 2FA. Any password manager, even a mediocre one, is infinitely better than the sticky note on the monitor approach.\n\nThat said, LastPass's breach response was genuinely terrible and they deserve every bit of criticism. But the lesson isn't \"password managers are unsafe\" — it's \"choose one that doesn't store your vault metadata unencrypted.\"",

If your server gets popped and you log in through the browser, the server can just serve you whatever JS it wants. Doesn't matter how good the crypto is at that point. Native clients and the browser extension don't have this problem since they're not served by the backend.\n\nHonestly for personal use, KeePassXC with the database on Syncthing has always been the simplest threat model. No server to compromise at all — just an encrypted blob that gets synced peer-to-peer. The tradeoff is convenience, but if you're already comfortable with a terminal, it's not much of one.",

This is where things are getting more complicated since \"algorithm's new input\" must be somehow stored/managed.

There are big issues with this approach unfortunately. The biggest is that if you need a way to change passwords that have been compromised the only way to do that is to remember that you have chosen a different input for this particular site or to change the password for every site.\n\nAnother issue I ran into is that different services have different acceptable password criteria. So if the algorithm always generates a 12 character password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters you will run into services that do not accept special characters or have a strict length requirement that your output does not match. I solved this by adding switches to customize the output, but again I needed to remember which sites I enabled those switches for.\n\nMy script used an algorithm salted with a long string of random characters, then required an input of a \"master password\" and an custom input per site. Usually I would use something like \"reddit\" or \"google\" but quickly ran into another issue which was that I have multiple reddit and google accounts, so for some sites I had to use username+site and others just the site - another piece of data to remember.\n\nIn the end I found a password manager to be more flexible and solve all of these problems, while adding the tiny risk that someone could steal my vault.

We are not automatically forcing ID verification for existing users nor are we requiring all new customers to ID verify.\n\nWe have had ID verification in place for some new accounts and for some other limited circumstances for years. \n\nIf you already have an account without verification then you had an experience like the majority of our customers. \n\nIf you are creating a new account and are asked to ID verify then please understand this is not a blanket requirement and we try to make it as limited as possible with the goal of preventing fraud and abuse. Our pricing attracts savvy builders as well as spammers, and we want to keep the spammers out so we can focus on building the world's best registrar.  \n\nSo, to the point of whether you would be asked to ID verify now that you have an account: No, save for very specific and limited edge cases below. There is no business reason to do this en masse.\n\nYou may voluntarily ID verify with us to get access to certain features, like ACH payment, or to regain control of a lost account, or an account owned by a deceased customer, etc. I would consider all of those actions initiated by the customer.\n\nAs far as actions that initiate as a result of our operations, if there is reasonable suspicion that your account is being used for DNS abuse, we may require ID verification. So while I can't say it will never happen to existing accounts, it is very, very rare within the scope of our 500,000 active customers and quite frankly is targeted at illegal or harmful activity. These determinations are made by human experts.",

That attracts the kinds of customers we want to grow with, including builders, developers, and small businesses. It also attracts fraudsters and spammers who make the internet worse for everyone. Selective ID verification is one of the tools we use to tell the difference without making every legitimate user jump through hoops.\n\nImportantly, verification provides a path forward for legitimate customers. Without it, the alternative would often be outright denial or permanent restriction.\n\nWe've used Veriff for selective verification for years. We are frequently revisiting the fraud-centric triggers for ID verification in order to block as many bad actors and let as many good customers in.

You've run out of ideas, what's left is maintenance, and that sucks, so you abandon the project shortly thereafter. \n\n2. You have plenty of \"ideas\" which leads to a vibe coded bloatware of a project that lost site of what it was supposed to be. You constantly chase the validation and dopamine hits of reddit posts for \"new features\" meanwhile the codebase erodes steadily because maintenance, planning, and architecture doesn't get upvotes or tickle your lizard brain.\n\nUltimately something happens, you run out of ideas, the app becomes too much of a parody of itself and it falls out of favor, or some massive hole is found, and you have a huntarr. Either isn't sustainable, one takes slightly longer to implode than the other. \n\nNo one says you can leverage an LLM in development, and a project can't survive with LLM helping. However, projects that are deliberate, have a vision, and are a true passion project aren't going to rely on AI slop \"productivity\" and constantly peddling their 95% LLM garbage can in here.\n\n/soapbox",

The former is way more performant and scalable but the later is far more established and easier to do initial setup. Without doing a reasonably deep dive it'd be hard to know that.\n\nThis is also a broader problem with open source. There's just a lot out there and until you gain a level of expertise it's hard to evaluate.\n\nAnother feature that'd be fun to see is a \"beginner's first services\" list that included things that were easy to set up and maintain with good ROI on effort (things like Plex) that are great gateways into self-hosting.\n\nMaybe one day I'll just build this myself but maintaining it would be really hard, haha.",

Most projects are using AI in some form directly or indirectly so compiling lists of “AI-coded services” feels largely pointless. \n\nI don’t really get the witch-hunt against apps that were built fully or partially with AI. The tool isn’t the core issue  hygiene and common sense is. Non–mission-critical software is usually fine if it’s deployed responsibly, and it’s not that hard to apply basic hardening. AI can significantly speed up development, and that matters. Most FOSS developers have jobs next to their hobby. \n\nI’m not saying AI is the holy grail, and fully vibe-coded projects probably shouldn’t be exposed directly to the open internet without proper review. But if it gets the job done, its ran locally I really don't see the issue.\n\nEven in light of Huntarr, the scale of the issue feels exaggerated. If you didn’t expose the service publicly, you were likely fine. As u/darksoft125 pointed out, the bigger issue was how the maintainer reacted to the reported problems. \n\nThis is my two cents on the whole AI debate. ",

In my opinion, they’re pretty basic for getting yt-dlp to work with services that are blocked in some countries, not to mention cookies.\n\nIt would also be nice to have instructions for running the app locally (not in docker). I assume it’s just about creating a virtual environment and installing requirements.txt, but where would I set things like THEME_COLOR or change the port?\n\nAnd sorry if this is a dumb question: if I run the .py file locally, do I need to manually update yt-dlp inside the virtual environment, or can the app handle that on its own?\n\nP.S. Personally, I see this more as a video downloader, with the option to just preview sometimes without downloading locally. And if it's also possible to download only audio, that would be just awesome. Either way thanks, I'm always all for new lightweight UIs for yt-dlp.",
