      "text": "The recent influx of AI has lowered the barrier to entry to create your own projects. This development in itself is very interesting and we're curious to see how it'll change our world of SelfHosting in the future. \n\nThe negative side of this however is the influx of AI generated posts, vibe-coded projects over a weekend and many others. Normally, the community votes with its voice. But with the high amount of posts flooding in every day, we've noticed a more negative and sometimes even hostile attitude towards these kinds of projects. \n\nThe stance of the SelfHosted moderation team is that the main focus of this sub should be on services that can be selfhosted and their related topics. For example, but not limited to: alternatives to popular services, taking back control over your data and privacy, containerization, networking, security, etc.\n\nIn order to bring back the focus on these main points of SelfHosting, we're introducing \"Vibe code Friday\". This means that anything AI-assisted or vibe-coded in relation to SelfHosting can be posted only on Fridays from here on out. \nThroughout the week, any app or project that falls within the category will be removed. Repeat-offenders will be timed out from posting. \n\nThis is to reduce the flood of these personal projects being posted all the time. And hopefully bring back the focus to more mature projects within the community. \n\nIn order to determine the difference (as going by code & commits alone can be a great indicator but by itself does not make a great case for what constitutes a vibe-coded or AI-assisted project) we've set the following guidelines:\n- Any project younger than a month old\n- With only one real collaborator (known AI persona's do not count, or are an even better indicator)\n- With obvious signs of vibe-coding*\nWill only be allowed on Vibe-code Fridays. \n\nWe'll run this as a trial for at least a month.\n\nSincerely, /r/SelfHosted mod team.",

Not only is it unethical to take credit for someone else's work, but there are still many people trying to decide how they feel about AI in general, so letting people know about its usage should be a baseline.",

              "text": "To be fair even before AI there were a lot of unmaintained projects. I myself wrote quite a few and stopped maintaining them because of time constraints or other reasons. \n\nAnd this is actually where AI can help, by reducing the time investment needed for many tasks it makes it easier to maintain such projects by solo devs or smaller numbers of collaborators.\n\nThat is, of course, not to support pure vibe coding, I am talking more about AI assisted development.\n\nThe definition and the line here is fuzzy though, because AI assisted is a very broad term and technically we've had ML based autocomplete for years. I understand the focus is on particularly LLM based things, but even here, as adoptions grows, the line between a good project and bad project will depend less and less on whether it was written by with assistance of AI or not.\n\nI think AI should be treated as a tool, not as a definitive determining quality factor of a project. That said, current criteria look fair, but I think everyone should understand that it blanket-covers basically any solo project. \n\nI think more indicators and criteria are needed to find a better line between \"sloppy work\" and \"good project written with assistance of AI\". For example, there were a lot of cool self hosted projects coming from university students. They are made by solo devs with no online track record, but theu are innovative and well written. As ofnright now they would fall under the definition.\n\nBut I am glad that the choice was made to funnel it all into fridays, instead of completely banning it. I think its still fair and in time we'll all be able to refine criteria and rules and everything.",

I sincerely hope this new initiative from the mods goes well, I wish you all the best o7 I think this is definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nAlso a sidenote: another thing that irks me is when \"disclosure\" is just one sentence at the top which is a variation of \"I used ___ AI to do a bunch of stuff, but I also used my 30+ year experience in IT and network security to vet the code and make sure it's good 👍🚀\" and then nothing else at all.

The argument against is that it makes it REALLY hard for someone trying to share their idea or project to get it across in that small period of time, which leads to gamification (i.e. posting first to get upvotes).\n\nThe argument for individual threads is that it's more like a regular sub experience, but it could certainly lead to a messier situation. Also, just because you limit the submission to Friday doesn't mean the conversation stops there, so it could be a bit hard to monitor. Maybe if you go this route, at least some flair identifying it as either \"AI-Assisted\" or \"Friday Vibe-Coding\" could be useful?\n\nUltimately, just be transparent that it's an experiment, that the community can see how it goes for a while, and adjust based on feedback.\n\n*EDIT*: It also might be nice to have some guidelines for people posting AI-coded projects. For example, best-practices might include being transparent about the AI-assisted nature of the project, making sure to add info to any README about being careful about hosting it outside a private/protected network, if the project is intended to be maintained or more of a one-off, etc. Most of these are reasonable concerns that people have about AI-assisted projects, so just helping people to be clear about their projects and intentions might help everyone out as well.",

Not saying they're AI generated, but more that it would be unpleasant if some of us deployed something AI written and then the person who released it just vanishes when there's issues. There's also the security viewpoint of are they combing over the code the AI generated carefully enough to make sure there's no chances of data breaching or leaking.. \n\nOn the other hand, as an ex-DJ who saw the migration from vinyl records to CDs to digital djing, there was alot of vinyl DJs that looked down at CD DJs, and then alot of CD DJs that looked down at digital DJs and so on. New technology came around, the older crew would die on their hill of the older media and others adapted. I played on all 3 media, it never bothered me, buuuuut it did (as the mods said) lower the entry point for people to start DJing which in turn lowered the value and quality of DJs in the industry.. Those who adapted continued to play but just specialised more on their art, those who didn't adapt continued to play too, just a bit less often so they moved to other roles in the industry (like promoters or marketing or management rolesbat venues).",

Vibe coding is defined by not looking at or even thinking about the code being produced.  It's usually done for fun, or for throwing together pet projects.\n\nAI-assisted programming, however, is often used for writing test suites, validating outputs, writing commit messages, or even checking logic.  For any code authorship, developers can (and should) validate the output completely.  It's now a standard tool to use in professional development.\n\nAre you making the requirement too broad by including any AI assistance in your partial ban?

Even certain boilerplate tasks make sense to be ‘handed off’ to AI as just a prompt. \n\nAnyway my point is, I think this is only going to lead towards more divisiveness, more AI witch hunts, and less collaboration, communication and community building.\n\nI read all of the responses about looking more for ‘maturity’ and if that’s the case then you need to reword the rules you’ve laid out here. Having ‘new project Fridays’ is way more inclusive than ‘AI Slop Fridays’. This line in the sand is wiggly and unclear and it’s going to hurt the community until it is more clearly defined.",

It's not necessarily a measure of quality or maturity. But the barrier to creating something new has been lowered and more and more people can now create. This is good! But it's also the risk and partially the reason why there's been a flood of new projects almost every hour.\n\nIf your project is new, just aim for the Fridays now. The tools used aren't that important, but do flair correctly. \n\nIf you gain some traction, you'll grow out of the limitations quickly and hopefully the project can become more mature.

          "text": "I've really enjoyed this community as it has introduced me to a number of great projects that I find useful. I also understand that a flood of \"low effort\" clones is frustrating. However, as a developer, I find this decision and the distaste for people using AI to help them develop their projects disappointing. We have to learn how to use these tools to the be able to survive in our industry, and using AI tools in our spare time is the best way to get that practice. I have gone from a bunch of half-baked ideas to being able to create projects that I'd be willing to ship with a bit more time. I don't have the luxury of lots of spare time either, and I would rather finish things that just dream about them. Can absolutely can develop quality code with tools like Claude Code with the right approaches and not \"Build me a clone of X\".\n\nThe \"any project that has existed for less than a month\" is arbitrary, but reasonable. That's enough time for someone putting decent effort into a project to make sure the code isn't half-baked. The other two I can't agree with it. There's a lot of developers who enjoy working alone on projects because its our chance to do something our way. There are plenty of projects that have solo maintainers at the start before they grow a community.\n\nI leave my \"coded with Claude Code\" and Claude contributor enabled for transparency, but it's also been in a number of places, including here, a judgement against people and their projects. Again, as a developer, I find that very discouraging and disappointing. I probably put more thought and work into my code now than I ever have. Now, I just spend more time planning and creating specifications than I do writing code. But getting noses turned up at you in the industry and out in communities is frustrating.\n\nI promise you, what people call \"AI slop\" has existed for far longer than a year or so. Where do you think AIs learned to write code like that? Existing code. There have been open source projects for decades now. Before now, did you go look and people's repositories and review their code before you used it? I'm sure the answer is that there are a number of people who both do and don't. What I used to like about open source software was that it was a way to say \"check out this cool thing I did!\". People would try it out and then make their judgement calls about whether it was good enough. And there's a decent number of free applications with questionably quality code, but people use it because it's free and it works. So where's the line?\n\nI know the intent is to keep the quality of projects shared here high, but what I read between the lines and see in comments is \"if you use AI to help you code your project, it probably sucks\". I can't change people's sentiments, and the rules of this community are certainly out of my control. However, it also feels like inclusive and makes this less of a place I would like to visit.",

We're fighting spam in a certain way.\n\nA month limitation is enough time for people to lose interest, not gain traction and abandon a project. With this we still give people the opportunity to float their ideas and test the waters. If they gain any traction here in that time, some commitment they'll easily grow out of the one month limitation and maybe even gain a few people willing to collaborate. \n\nOf course, this is our hope.

Then, they share it.  This is where it goes wrong with a community.  They're not sure how to describe it accurately and sell their project in a way that isn't accurate.  The community isn't used to the volume. They call it a flood.   And, it's a natural thing in Programming when new tools were made that made it more accessible.   Remember Visual Basic?  It made programming more accessible to many people, and, there were many projects with it, and everyone looked down on it because the programmers were inexperienced. \n\nPeople don't like it.  They say..  it's maintainability, it's security,   it's clanker...  And, in some of them, that's true.  In others, it's just 'the neighbor stole my lawnmower' excuse (for those who don't know the story, the moral is that humans tend to make up an excuse for when they don't like something, even if they don't know, or won't articulate the reason that they don't like the thing.)\n\nThanks for trying something, and, you're right to think of this as a trial.

CBZ files are just ZIP files, and ZIP files are random-access at the file level (though not within files). They contain an index that allows seeking to arbitrary files. I know you know this because you correctly said in your README that both CBZ and your BBF format include an index as a footer. So why are you saying the opposite here? \n\nYou say you observed CPU usage spikes when scrubbing through pages, but why are you attributing that to the file format itself, and not the reader program you're using?\n\nAnyway, I think there's something badly wrong with your benchmark. There's no indication in your repo of how you actually measured performance, but you seem to be overestimating the latency of reading CBZ files by at least 20x.\n\nMy very simple benchmark code:\n\n    import zipfile, random\n    zf = zipfile.ZipFile(\"test.cbz\")\n    filenames = [info.filename for info in zf.infolist() if not info.is_dir()]\n    \n    def random_read():\n        filename = random.choice(filenames)\n        with zf.open(filename) as f:\n            f.read()\n\nThis is what I get when I run it on a real-world archive (about 46MB):\n\n    $ python3 -mtimeit -s \"import cbz_bench\" \"cbz_bench.random_read()\"\n    5000 loops, best of 5: 84.3 usec per loop\n\nWhich is 22x faster than the fastest of your CBZ benchmark results.\n\nI am extremely doubtful that your format is *actually* meaningfully faster than CBZ.",

Like, come on, Kotatsu, the \"Days\" in \"Sakamoto Days\" does not refer to the time budget you have to open the weekly releases.\n\nIt makes no sense to me: indexing into a JPG should be fast. Loading a JPG should be fast. I wonder if modern CBZ readers just lazily include a pre-made zip library to completely decompress the entire archive before loading the images. Or if people creating the CBZ files do not understand ZIP files and turn on maximum compression, expecting to squeeze more bits out JPGs, adding pointless decompression overhead without any real gains.",

People running CLI commands they don't really understand and using file formats they don't really understand. They get a result *that to them* looks correct but is technically broken.

It's meaningless to talk about \"seeking\" in a memory-mapped archive because there's no file pointer to seek.\n\nTo do a meaningful benchmark, you need to actually do something with the data. For a comic archive format, a natural choice is to *decode* a randomly-chosen image file to read its pixel data. And this is a more useful measurement, because it tells you how much speedup you can expect from an actual reader implementation.\n\nSo I wrote another simple benchmark that does exactly that, using Python's Pillow library to decode PNGs:\n\n    $ python3 -mtimeit -s \"import cbz_bench_decode\" \"cbz_bench_decode.random_read()\"\n    100 loops, best of 5: 2.51 msec per loop\n    $ python3 -mtimeit -s \"import bbf_bench_decode\" \"bbf_bench_decode.random_read()\"\n    100 loops, best of 5: 2.41 msec per loop\n\nSo there is a small difference in performance, but in a realistic environment it's only about 4% faster, not 100x as you claimed in your title.\n\nThe *absolute* speedup is only about ~100usec, which is much smaller than the differences between CBZ and BBF that your benchmark claimed to show. And such a small time interval is absolutely imperceptible to humans. So whatever was causing the \"CPU spikes\" that you saw, it almost certainly wasn't due to the file format.\n\nI don't think you're lying. I didn't say that and I didn't mean to imply it. I do think that your benchmark methodology is probably flawed.",

To justify that, you would want to see actual concrete benefits that are specific to the metadata format. And in particular you'd want to see advantages that outweigh the disadvantages of losing XML's extensibility.\n\nThe criticism expressed in the README is that even though CBZ has an XML metadata format, it's not standardized across different reader software. So writing it up as a documented standard (or designing an alternative) that all the reader implementations could agree on, without losing any functionality, *would* be a valuable contribution.

I did the tests using high-resolution scans of One Piece. The benchmarks are as close as you can get to real-world numbers.\n\n\\> But what are the measurable impacts on users experience that justify its existence.  \n1. It's faster on external hard drives by a longshot. If you want to load all of one piece and go to 320, BBF has O(1) random access and scrubbing (except for my HDD trial, which is because of the threading), and it can map directly onto your SSD with mmap.  \n2. Because of this, it consumes significantly less CPU. So if you're on a mobile device, reading in BBF format is better for your battery life.  \n3. Images are also deduplicated, which is great for manhwa. When testing, I downloaded Solo Leveling from mangadex and put it in BBF format. There was nearly 200 deduplicated pages. CBZ doesn't do any deduplication.",

Tar has the advantage of there being plenty of tools to work with it, but also the disadvantage of having features you don't need and having to maintain the index file yourself. Or perhaps an uncompressed zip file...\n\nEven so I can see the vision behind a more optimised file format. I will advise that you should add a bit more metadata on the individual asset files, so if a single page gets corrupted, the image decoder will know how long the buffer is expected to be and will not try to read past it and from the start of the next file. Basically, please use a variation of RIFF.\n\nAside from that, I also question the choice of padding everything to 4kB. You wouldn't store images uncompressed and 4k is a significant portion of the size of a compressed black and white image. Why not keep everything packed in the file and just do 4k-aligned transfers plus an offset into the data to the GPU? You will have to decompress the image on the GPU anyway. At least make the padding optional or configurable.",

          "text": "Appreciate the work, I really do and it might even work well, but CBZ was made to be simple as pie. You can zip up a folder with the images and rename the ZIP extension to CBZ. Done. Comic stored, and lots of readers can read it without having to unzip the darn thing.\n\nCPU spikes? Is that really a problem? You're not flipping though the pages really fast when you read. And most of hardware people use to read comics is powerful enough to deal with the extra CPU usage. Maybe some optimization on the reader program could solve a bit of that too.\n\nThe metadata do need some work. I don't think a simple format like CBZ should use some hard to read XML just because some reader made one. I would go for a more typable INI file or something. That would make it more approachable by people using no software.\n\nThe credits pages should probably be replaced with credits in the metadata. Readers could make that data more proeminent, always showing a resume of the credits at the end for example. Just imagine if using credits metadata the translators could also add links to their sites and forums, and it was easily accessible by the users. I imagine just a simple metadata file could solve this.\n\nIf you're gonna make a new format and is gonna be \"machine-crafted\" instead of \"hand-crafted\", then make sure it can add all sorts of possible features people may want in the future. A translation layer would be great to share manga using original files while still making them readable by non-japanese speakers, for example. \n\nSome comics make references to other comics so having hyperlink support that allow the program to find said file with a click while not knowing exactly the filename could be tricky to program but also a fun project if the program maintains a database of the comic files people have. Kinda like a \"microformats\" that just add a relationship and shows the user if they exist.\n\nAnyways, the idea is not bad. I just think it needs some kind of benefit that would *really* make people wanna use it more than just using the old and trusted method of ZIP renaming. It's similar of when the internet invented JPEGs to see stuff back in the day but is not in a rush to change for a more efficient WEBP format. :P",

You just need a separate file to tell the reader which region is which page, to support different reader modes.\n\n\nThe credits thing is nice but no one outside of a few older anime nerds uses MKV ordered chapters to save 100x the space so I don't think it's a priority for folks.",

I am currently experiencing a critical administrative issue with our official Docker Hub account `bentopdf`\n\nDue to an error during an organization migration, we have temporarily lost control of the `bentopdf` namespace on Docker Hub. **The** `bentopdf` **username/namespace may currently be in a released state, meaning it could potentially be registered by a third party.**  \n  \n**DO NOT** perform a `docker pull bentopdf/...` command at this time.  \n**DO NOT** update your existing containers to `latest`.  \n**If you use BentoPDF in CI/CD pipelines:** Pause your builds or ensure you are using a locally cached version of the image.  \n**If you must deploy:** Please verify that you are using a specific, previously known SHA256 digest that you have already pulled successfully in the past.\n\nI am extremely sorry first of all. While attempting to convert the bentopdf account to an Organization to be verified as a Docker publisher, I renamed the admin to \"alam\"(my name), which I thought would be the new username. I didn't realize that to migrate you need another Docker ID, and this particular docker ID belongs to someone else. We currently do not have access to the \"alam\" account, and the original bentopdf handle is no longer associated with our verified email.\n\nI have already escalated this to Docker Hub Security and Support with \"High Priority\" status to revert the changes and secure the namespace, but they have replied they can't do so. I am in conversation with them to restore our account.\n\nI will update this thread immediately once we have regained control and verified the integrity of the images.\n\nUntil further notice, please consider the Docker Hub `bentopdf` namespace as UNVERIFIED.  \n  \nI am once again very sorry for my negligence and if someone can help me out on this I would be grateful. Thank you.\n\nEDIT: It seems that the new user was last active 5 years ago and hasn't had any activity since. But it's still better to take the necessary precautions \n",

And mine was a personal account. So I read the docs and was converting my personal account to an organizational account during which, I name the new admin username to \"alam\" or so I thought. Turns out this was supposed to be another existing Docker ID, so it was an error on my end. But they didn't ask for any verification so i thought it's just a new username. \n\nNow this particular ID \"alam\" belongs to a third person, which I've no access to and now they have access to our bentopdf Docker image. \n\nNothing suspicious has been done but I believe it's my responsibility to let everyone know until this is resolved and we get back the account.",

      "text": "I've been selfhosting for close to 10 years now. Even longer if you count running a Minecraft server on my PC using Hamachi to share it with friends. I made a lot of mistakes that I want to share to hopefully prevent people from making them as well. Here they are, in no particular order.\n\n# Backups\n\nI had to re-do my whole setup multiple times simply because I was too lazy to do backups. Of course, the 3-2-1 strategy is recommended, but you don't have to do it right from the start. Even storing a copy of the important data on an external hard drive is better than nothing\n\n# Containers or even VMs over bare-metal\n\nThe first server I had was pretty much just an FTP server with a simple php script to do directory listing. For that purpose, running bare metal was more than enough.\n\nThen I started exploring what's possible and wanted to install some actual apps. Nextcloud, Jellyfin, git server, things like that. And boy, was that quickly becoming a nightmare of dependencies, systemd units, and weird \"one off\" commands I had to run every time the server restarted.\n\nEnter Docker. More specifically, Docker Compose. Now I just have a bunch of yaml files that I can push to the server and have Docker take care of running everything, without needing to spend hours on solving missing dependencies and port conflicts\n\n# Infrastructure As Code\n\nBuilding on the previous point, IaC really made managing the server much easier. There are many tools for that, like Ansible or Terraform, but you don't need them.\n\nEven if it's just some `docker-compose.yaml` files and a script that runs `docker compose up -d` over SSH helps immensely. It takes some discipline to not do \"one off\" quickfixes on the server, or at least to sync them up with the IaC.\n\nFor a while I used a Gitlab repo with a pipeline that ran scripts on the server when things changed. That worked surprisingly well, but had the downside of being tied to a specific cloud product. I'm now on Ansible, and TBH I'm only staying with it cause I spent a lot of time setting it up and it's working for me now.\n\n# My OS of choice\n\nOn my desktop, I run Arch btw. It's really good for that use case. It also can be ran on a server, so I gave it a chance. After all, what could go wrong, since I'm only using the OS to run Docker...\n\nZFS. And Wireguard. And constant updates... In short, the updates can cause some things to be just slightly incompatible enough to cause things to break. I've had multiple cases of ZFS kernel module not loading, causing the storage pool to not mount, all the apps failing, and everything dying.\n\nIn short: if you're just running Docker, ZFS and Wireguard, just use Debian, don't be an idiot like me.\n\n# You won't get targeted by hackers; you will get auto-attacked by hundreds of bots every day\n\nHackers are very unlikely to target you specifically. And why would they, there's plenty of better targets for them.\n\nWhat will keep attacking you are the automated bots and port scanners. Nothing unusual, that's just a thing that happens when you're open to the internet.\n\nHowever, you should make sure you're protected. Don't let SSH auth with password, close down ports you don't need, keep everything updated, that sort of things. There are guides about all that, look them up.\n\n# Server at home is nice, but a VPS or a rented root server is just as valid\n\nSo many people here will say that you're not \"actually\" selfhosting if you don't have the server physically in your basement. Fuck every single person who says that.\n\nIt's really fun to own your hardware, it's a one-time investment with upgrades that aren't that expensive. And it also means you can get even a 10Gb/s connection to your server from your computers if you really want.\n\nBut it has several downsides. Noise, power consumption, space, _the price_. Don't let yourself be convinced that those are always worth it, because they're not. I wasted a lot of money on replacement fans cause my server is just too loud.\n\n# 99.999999999% of people won't care\n\nExpect to be the only user of your shit. Maybe with Jellyfin you'd have some people using that, but don't expect to have any users. And if you do - expect to receive complaints whenever things are broken",

I tried to see if my wife could restart it, but it wouldn't boot.  No problem, I ssh'ed into my other server (because everyone has more than one, right?), pulled the restic backup of the plex directory, did a \"docker compose up -d\" and a few minutes later my wife was happily watching Plex again.\n\nHaving all my docker compose files backed up along with their local volumes was a huge lifesaver (or wifesaver).  Also putting all non-temp storage either in a local directory that is backed up or an NFS share makes moving the containers around trivial.",

Same with flooding, earthquakes, accidents, coronal mass ejections.\n\nYour offsite backup shouldn’t be your first restore target, local backups and snapshots are great for that. The remote is disaster recovery.\n\nOh, and test those backups regularly. An untested backup is nothing but a hope. \n\nI’ve personally experienced not being able to restore a backup that was on a remote NAS running RAID1. Everything was fine, backup validated 20% daily, no errors anywhere, until it came time to restore, then nothing worked. I fortunately had other backups so no data was lost.",

          "text": "This is great advice. Backups and virtualization really should be the first things everyone should learn when initially getting into self hosting. \n\nI highly recommend anyone starting out to just get started with Proxmox. It’s very well documented, easy to install, and the built in backup service is great for beginners. LXCs let you have lightweight VMs for most anything you want to run with easy snapshots to roll back to if you bork something. ZFS is built in making shared storage across your virtual systems a breeze.\n\nFor slightly more advanced users setting up PBS on mediocre hardware (or even an LXC on your host) lets you create off site backups, or at the very least, a backup separate from your main host. It has deduplication built in and can be paired to any other Proxmox host letting you easily restore backed up LXCs to any host. For real world example of this, I had PBS running on an old celeron NAS and ended up borking my main Proxmox host’s install by doing dumb zfs things. I wiped the install drive, booted to the Proxmox install iso, paired up PBS, and had all of my services up and running within 20 minutes. The main benefit is keeping the host install of Proxmox clean. The only thing I run on it is NUT for my UPS, so after a fresh install of the hypervisor, I reinstall NUT, copy over the configs, and it’s all set. \n\nI’ve only been doing this hobby for a few years now. I started with a pi4 running docker compose for some services. But switching to proxmox has made my life so much easier. WARNING: you may end up making your life more complicated once you realize how much potential Proxmox has though 😉",

I turned my homelab into a whitelist‑only mesh net and I’m pretty happy with it.  \nI’ve got 3 Raspberry Pis (3B, 4, 5, none uses the sdcard anymore), 6 laptops, 1 desktop, 1 NAS, and a FRITZ!Box holding the DHCP and gate keys to a fixed IPv4 and a /48 public IPv6, while WireGuard handles outside access (phones, road warriors and rental servers). Everything talks back and forth to a small army of LEB VPSs scattered around the globe, and two “beefy” and barely mental bare‑metals in Hetzner and OVH.\n\nMy Technitium cluster runs dockerized on the Pi 5 and on the Pi 3B metal to feed the local domain. Docker NPM manages my local certs and redirects, with a Cloudflare API key for renewals, which then distributes the certs to itself, Portainer, Mailcow, Vaultwarden, Technitium, etc, across the homelab.\n\nWhat really made things click was an iptables‑nft + ipset setup: a “trusted\\_whitelist” (all the servers above + home devices) and a “bad\\_guys” list fed by fail2ban. The bare‑metals call home via WireGuard and only accept traffic from the whitelisted ipset, which conveniently includes VPN clients coming from my home FRITZ!Box.\n\nMy next step is figuring out how to share the bad\\_guys ipset across all hosts so that if one blocks an IP, the others do too. CrowdSec helps with its canned bouncers, but sometimes I like to run my own game.",

[Blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky)  \nDNS Proxy - alternative to Pihole, Adguard Home, ... Can be fully configured using a yaml file which is great for automated deployments.\n\n2. [Davis](https://github.com/tchapi/davis)  \nDAV server based on sabre/dav. It supports LDAP as an authentication backend, so it pairs great with something like LLDAP.  \nI use it as a backend for the great [tasks.org](http://tasks.org) app.\n\n3. [Gatus](https://github.com/TwiN/gatus)  \nUptime-Monitoring. While not super unknown, i feel like it doesn't get nearly as much attention as Uptime Kuma. Can be fully configured using a config file which is (again) great for automated deployments/GitOps, ... I also found the main developer to be very nice and responsive.\n\n4. [Papra](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra)  \nDocument management system. Paperless is one of my most used services and has more functionality than i'll probably ever need.  \nI recently started testing Papra as a more lightweight and minimalistic alternative and i like it a lot so far.\n\nWhat are your favorite lesser known services that don't get mentioned on here often enough?\n\n",

Usually I’m at the two task views and plan out the next few weeks, but when I have a larger task (aka project) I go up to the rough timeline and see where it can go and if I have to shuffle anything around. Then when a projects coming up, I create children tasks in the task view as per the usual task flow. \n\nIt was kind of strange to me how basically no software besides Notion let me do this simply, in one unified timeline. The flow seems so natural: “when can I do this big thing?” (project timeline); “ok, when it’s time to do it, what’s the actual work?” (task timeline); “ok, what’s next?” (task kanban). \n\nAnyway, all of that’s just a long way of saying +1 to OpenProject even though I don’t use it due to Notion accidentally allowing something perfectly tailor made for me haha",

          "text": "I posted it elsewhere yesterday but here it is again:\n\n...But there is a lot of other obscure stuff that isn't talked about, yet it blows all the shitty web apps that try to shove ads, subscriptions and more ads in your face when you are in a pinch.\n\nSo here is a list of stuff that I use quite often, even expose so that the people around me can use too - free of charge and most importantly, safely. A common theme among these is that most of them are just web apps without any storage required - you are just shipping the app to them.\n\n- **lyqht/mini-qr** - This one is a multitool for QR codes - generating and reading. It has lots of features and\n- **withoutbg/app** - Somebody posted it a while ago - it removes backgrounds with AI. That's it. Does a decent job. Stops friends and relatives from using predatory services. **I'm looking for an upscaler and an image expander app as well! Suggestions, please!**\n- **bentopdf/bentopdf** - PDF toolbox. Almost everything you need for PDF editing. I use it interchangeably with striling-pdf but striling have gone a bit intrusive so I recommend bento.\n- **vert-sh/vert** - Universal converter. Converts stuff in a pinch. I actually recommend Tichau/FileConverter which is a windows program (not selfhosted) because it's brilliantly executed. But I use this when on another computer.\n- **iib0011/omni-tools** - a toolbox of stuff. Works well. Jack of all trades but master of none. Still, worth having.\n\nThese aren't public but I use them all the time.\n\n- **chartdb/chartdb** - Visualizes databases. Very helpful if you need to work with databases. I file it under exploratory.\n- **sqlpad/sqlpad** - Web-based SQL editor. I use it daily to run database queries. Just noticed it's been archived which saddens me. A really really handy app.\n- **sharevb/it-tools** - A lot of IT tools that have changed management over the years. It's a huge toolbox with a lot of stuff that 90% of people will never use but it has saved the day several times.\n- **gchq/cyberchef** - More tools for data transformation. Really handy if you aren't sure what you are dealing with and don't want to write a bunch of sacrificial python code to sift through it. Again, filed under exploratory.\n- **lissy93/networking-toolbox** - Lots of networking tools. The few that I used were helpful. Worth having around.\n- **sigoden/dufs** - A very lightweight file server with very simple Web UI AND file serving. You just copy the link to the file and it's served to you raw. I often use it to serve .css files, .js files, scripts. It's just a no-frills solution to multiple problems.\n- **rr-/szurubooru** - This might be weird. It's an image board that has ties to anime/hentai, etc. I use it for SFW stuff, in fact, for work stuff. With the NSFW features stripped. Someone suggested this unorthodox approach a while ago and it turns out, it's an amazing image board with a really nice API that makes automated uploads a breeze. The tagging and categorization engine is what pulled me in initially. IMO, the best approach ever.\n\nThere are also a couple of games I host for friends:\n\n- **massivedecks/server and client** - It's a Cards against Humanity clone. Works well. \n- **biosmarcel/scribble.rs** - Pictionary game. It's very responsive. It's a lot of fun too.\n\n#### If anyone has other nifty little apps that are worth sharing, please do so! I fucking hate the online tools that offer something you desperately need but do a piss-poor job and demand payment/private info.",

For example invidious allows you to have an account on the selfhosted instance to subscribe to channels, create playlists etc., all that without the need for a google account like you would need for youtube. You can basically just browse through all the content like you can with the original website, just readonly (cant upload content etc.).\n\nThe only way for them to track you with privacy frontends is your IP but that shouldn't be a problem for most people with dynamic IP's. Also sharing your instance with other people makes it basically impossible for them to connect any collected data to your identity. \n\nIt's also just nice to be less connected to services like google. FOSS is our best chance at getting our privacy back. There are lots of android companion apps as well for selfhosted services, for invidious I really like [https://github.com/lamarios/clipious](https://github.com/lamarios/clipious)",

For a $25 eufy camera and a docker/lxc container, you can have a local linux webcam you can ssh into to manage, and automatically capture video feed and realtime audio detection/recording of birds by their calls. \n\nBirdnet-go sits in an lxc and listens to thingino webcam over RTSP. All bird calls are identified with a lightweight ML detection model, and recordings with spectrograms are stored. \n\nHome assistant listens for motion detection events on thingino and takes snapshots and sends notifications to me and my wife of motion events detected. I also have an ffmpeg stream onto a different device to record that I enable/disable as needed. Basically an all-around wildlife detection solution for our deck. Endless entertainment with our chipmunks, squirrels, raccoons, borbs, possums, etc.!",

Both thingino/birdnet-go in general, along with their combination. \n\nBiggest annoyance is unstable RTSP streams when trying to record the realtime video stream via an ffmpeg service running on another device. E.g. transiently unstable rtsp streams fucking things up and necessitating restarting my little ffmpeg service...I gave up trying to get it to recognize when the file died and just set a cronjob to kill it and restart 4 times a day lmao. It'd probably be easier on a more normal systemd machine, but I want it to be running on my gentoo box just because of storage and how I have stuff laid out...and I want my gentoo box to continue running openrc because I specifically use it to stay on my toes for personal/professional development haha.\n\nKinda a pain in the ass but not surprising, given the cheap hardware and the fact that it's over my local wifi network using dated unifi APs. If you're not trying to hammer it with video streams and motion/sound detection and the whole rigmarole, you probably won't have any issues tbh.",

From there they can browse, through Tor, without censorship.\n\nThe speeds are typical Tor speeds - it's just another way of connecting to Tor that gets around censorship by hiding Tor within https.\n\nFor my personal use, I treat Tor like an extra layer of private browsing/incognito mode.  I use it when I don't want to see ads for the next few weeks for things that I've searched for. The ISP/VPN company can't see what I'm accessing, and the site I'm accessing can't see my browser/IP. By running the Webtunnel Bridge from my IP, my Tor traffic blends in with thousands of others who also use it. I do see connections to the bridge from countries where censorship is common, so it's nice to know it is getting used.\n\nThe bridge is different from an [exit node](https://community.torproject.org/relay/types-of-relays/). The bridge only provides access to Tor. The actual traffic exits elsewhere. My bridge is only connecting to other Tor relays.",

I used to work at meta and internally we had a tool called bunnylol which serves as kind of a command line for your browser url bar. You configure it as your browsers default search engine. Then setup a bunch of shortcuts and commands. Then you can use your url bar to quickly redirect to your fav sites like “r <subreddit name>” would go to reddit “r” by utself goes to the home page, “g <search term>” for google, etc. your browser already supports some amount of this but bunny gives you way more flexibility. This may not seem like a big deal but i cant really work without it anymore. \n\nThere are quite a few implementations on github but this one is the most complete imo https://github.com/jrodal98/brunnylol",

Need to do this. In the meantime, the tl;dr is you set up all transcription requests to go into a queue. Then you set up the Macs to read requests from the queue, perform the transcription work, and save the results. Then you set up an autoscaler in AWS to monitor the number of messages waiting in the queue. You can have the number of cloud instances idle low (or zero), so then if the Mac cluster were to go offline, the autoscaler fans out and the cloud takes over.   \n  \nSo this way you still have the resiliency of being in the cloud, but the spend only kicks in if your on-prem cluster goes offline.",

          "text": "I had actually tried setting up Koito when you first released it. I had set it up and it was working fine (except the lastfm or maloja imports). The problem that time I faced was that I had been using Maloja + Multiscrobbler + Plex for a very long time. So, I had exported my all time music streaming history from Spotify, Apple Music and Last FM and imported all of that to maloja after lot data preprocessing. So, I did the same with Koito and it didn't process all the imports properly. Same happened with trying to import maloja export.\n\nNow, the tracks which were imported from Spotify, I had no problem importing Spotify history with the number of minutes into Koito. But, for Apple Music I edited the export file to make it look like lastfm import, so it didn't have the minutes information. Same went for last fm import which didn't have any minutes information. So, when these two histories were imported as lastfm import, my import history got completely messed up, where Koito was not fetching anything for the lastfm imports. It was simply showing the artist name and track name in the dashboard (no images and in the logs it kept throwing some error) (I had just tried with a small batch of about 3k songs for the import).\n\nI am planning on trying it out again (this time fresh setup as well), but I had few of questions:\n\n* if I scrobble to Koito directly from say lastfm, how does koito fetch the number of minutes played for each track as lastfm doesn't store that info. Does it fetch the track length from any provider and use it as number of minutes played? If yes, then what happens if Koito is not able to find a particular track in any provider?\n* Also, does Koito by any chance support associations like Maloja does? For example, If I am listening to TWICE and I also separately listen to NAYEON, TZUYU OR MISAMO, Maloja gives me an option to view all these separate artists stats as one under TWICE as an association as they are all members of TWICE.\n* Currently, I moved to Navidrome permanently, so If I setup navidrome with Koito (like you have mentioned in the docs), for a track to be considered as a scrobble, what is the threshold? Does it get scrobbled when 50% of the track is played, or do I need to play the full song for it to get scrobbled to Koito?",

              "text": "Since I first posted about the project I've made improvements to importing, so your imports should hopefully work much better now, especially if you setup the connection with Navidrome before importing so that Koito can just grab the images from Navidrome. Duration information is now fetched and backfilled if Lastfm imports include a MusicBrainz Recording ID as well, so hopefully that will help with some of the problems. One thing that hasn't changed is that Maloja imports still will have no duration information at all, so time played still won't count for any new tracks imported with Maloja.\n\nFor your questions:\n\n- Lastfm doesn't store durations, but does sometimes store MusicBrainz Recording IDs, which Koito will use to get duration info. If an ID isn't provided, Koito will fill in the duration when it receives a listen of the song from Navidrome.\n- I've never used this feature in Maloja, so I don't really know how it works. Koito will just present the artists as they are listed in the track information, so if a song features an artist by name, it will count as a listen for that artist (look at Uncomfortably Numb by American Football ft. Hayley Williams in my public demo to see what I mean).\n- Koito does not determine that threshold at all, it is determined by your music player. For example, I use Feishin with Navidrome, and it has options in the settings to decide when to scrobble the listen back to your music server. I think the default is 4 minutes or 85% of the duration, whichever is sooner.\n\nHope that helps!",

You can even point your music server to Koito, then configure Koito to relay to Maloja so you don't have to give one of them up (I used to do this during Koito's initial development).",

Stuff disappearing, recommendations getting worse, the app turning into a podcast and AI promo machine instead of a music player.\n\nAround a year ago I started reading about Linux. Not installing yet, just reading. I knew I didn’t want to rush it and end up frustrated, so I took my time trying to actually understand how things work.\n\nAt the same time, Windows was starting to feel… weird. AI features everywhere, things changing without asking, more stuff running in the background than I was comfortable with. My computer stopped feeling like a tool and started feeling like a service I didn’t sign up for.\n\nEventually I made the jump.\n\nI’m on Debian now, keeping it simple and stable. Free software only where possible. I also went all in and Librebooted my hardware, which honestly felt great. No opaque BIOS junk, no mystery firmware before the OS loads. It’s boring in the best way.\n\nThe big win for me was music.\n\nI set up Navidrome and pointed it at about 2 TB of music I’ve collected over the years. My files, properly tagged, lyrics embedded, no ads, no algorithms. It just works. I can stream from any device, anywhere, and it feels like having my own private Spotify but without the nonsense.\n\nThis wasn’t a weekend project. I moved slowly, learned the basics, figured out backups and networking first. I wanted something that would still work a year from now without babysitting.\n\nOnce that was running, something clicked. If I can host my own music this easily, why am I outsourcing so much of my digital life?\n\nI’m not trying to be hardcore or preachy about it. This just feels calmer. More in my control.\n\nCurious if anyone else here dropped streaming services or Windows and ended up down the self-hosting rabbit hole too.",

Also buying albums gets very expensive in the long run. I like that I can try some artists on Spotify before I commit and buy their albums on vinyl (usually get a digital download with this too).

Over time the home screen filled up with podcasts, audiobooks, “shows,” promos, and recommendations I didn’t ask for, even when I mainly used it for albums and artists.\n\nIt’s not that podcasts are bad, it just felt like music became secondary and the UI was constantly trying to steer me instead of getting out of the way. That was part of what pushed me to just host my own library and keep things simple.",

I wonder if that was a result of an \"algorithm\" that was being fed contextual data about you from outside the context of spotify that led it to think that was what your preferences were... or if they were simply pumping in more features/content and the volume of new content got pushed onto users intentionally/inadvertently? My question to you, however, is whether you found this offensive because it broke your expectations of how you use/used spotify (ie. I curate spotify heavily, I use spotify to loosely generate playlists for me, I just want noise in the background that matches my preferences, I have certainly general daily routines and will try to seek music that matches my expected energy/mood). I'm just curious because I'm working on an personal project that is kinda trying to address that - at least from my perspective, so getting feedback from someone else is helpful if you don't mind. Especially when you are being so public about it 😂 and, I am a solo dev, not a marketer or whatever person doing market research rest assured fyi.",

I ran some optimization for the over clocking, tried multiple different configs and windows still was acting weird. Shortly after I thought I had the issue resolved, windows  decided it need to ping everything all the time all at once and started sending a dns request every half second or more... and then caused the threads assigned to the pi-hole to overheat and the machine to crash. \n\nI ended up setting up a raspberry pi and a old laptop both with pihole and a docker container to sync them so my wife could have some peace. The raspberry pi is phenomenal. Super stable, very low power draw. \n\n.... she still side eyes me every time google thinks to long.",

Is it better than a single drive with no backup? Yes. Is it something you want to gamble on? No. ",

Unraid has good raid storage options, so does cosmos cloud. You just need 1 parity, maybe one day if your more than 4 drives you can do 2. I use cosmos cloud and unRAID, which both use fundimentally same concept and it's very easy to setup. Basically 1 backup drive, but has to be the largest. \n\nHowever! Recommend setting up something like ironmount, which I think has been renamed? But it's a nice compression style backup, letting you backup to an external hard drive. I recommend an SSD if your putting it in your car due to moving a lot. \n\nThose are my opinions. Hope this helps, two easy steps. Been using jellyfin+immich +70 other containers for years now and have never had an issue. Except cheap sata controllers, don't use them!! \n\nGood luck!",

          "text": "When deciding if you want to use a raid configuration (e.g., mirroring / RAID 1), ask yourself if you need **redundancy**. That is, if the drive failed, how sad would you be? Could you rebuild? Could you endure the downtime? Would the disruption materially impact you? Redundancy in a self-hosting situation at home is often about the convenience of not having to sit down and rebuild everything (be it the OS or data) or restore backups.\n\nRedundancy become more and more important as you add drives. For each drive you add, the more likely it is that one will fail. This can be where we choose more between various configurations (RAID 5, 6, 10, etc.), and it's where you start sacrificing one or more drives worth of space for parity, allowing you to function through the loss of a drive. Different configurations have their own pros and cons, which can include the number of drives they can survive losing as well as read/write performance.\n\nBesides redundancy, also consider your **backup** situation. RAID won't help you to restore a deleted file, for example, or one hit by ransomware. A commonly advocated gold standard is the 3-2-1 rule, in which you have 3 copies of data (the original and two backups), on 2 different media, with 1 copy being in a different physical location (often the cloud, these days, but sometimes a friend or family's house). But at least have a backup somewhere, preferably on a different disk in a different computer. Then you can have the fun of asking yourself how much redundancy your backups need!\n\nHow much you stick to a strategy like 3-2-1 depends on how important the data is to you. Does it need to survive a catastrophic hardware failure (what if both drives in a mirror fail, or what if the entire computer gets fried or stolen)? Does it need to survive the house burning down? That may or may not be a concern.",

I would address this with good practices like not deleting from photo source for a week and copy your\"important stuff\" to a backup drive every day. That way if the HDD did die you lose nothing but time for the RMA. \n\nBackup: external HDD is the easiest, how big depends on the photo count and type you're gonna host. Typical adult with phone camera, 1TB would last a while. Photographer with RAW pictures, videos, teenage kids or selfie obsessed spouse, and many family members using starts pushing towards a higher need. Biggest thing with the backup is if you only do one, I would have a routine to backup each day and unplug it after. Every time I've lost a drive (other than one DOA), I could relate it to a power issue, or dropping it. Since we aren't dropping anything just protect the power by not powering it when not copying. If you want to automate this get a big external that needs power from the wall and plug it into a smart plug just be careful you don't have it cutting power while the drive is actively being written to.",

Of course, you ABSOLUTELY need backups besides RAID (the old saying \"raid is not backup\").\n\n3. Automatic Backups On-site and Off-Site - manually shuffling hard drives and manually performing \"cloning\" between them is not a robust backup solution for a big list of reasons.\n\n4.

      "text": "While working on my own KVM setup, it slowly dawned on me how awkward it is that we still treat BIOS as video. Most firmware screens are clearly text-based, yet we compress and push pixels around just to change a boot option or read an error message. The more I worked on it, the more that approach started to feel fundamentally wrong.\n\nIn an ideal world, everything would have a proper BMC. In practice, a lot of homelab gear - especially small servers, NUCs, and various Chinese or whitebox boards - simply doesn’t. And even when BMC is available, it’s not always something I want to depend on for last-resort recovery.\n\nSo I ended up building a small, dedicated hardware device for headless maintenance that I now keep in the rack as a “break glass” tool.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fz7s735g8rdg1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f7f8950b28cc29811c8aaa554eac9c58b8a6a8d\n\nThe first part is BIOS-to-Text. The device sits inline on HDMI and, instead of treating the signal as a video stream, it reconstructs what’s on the firmware screen and exposes it as an ANSI text interface over SSH. It’s intentionally focused on firmware and pre-OS environments rather than general-purpose graphics. From a terminal, I can navigate BIOS menus, read POST output, copy error messages, or script pre-OS workflows without dealing with video latency or blind keystrokes.\n\n[The output isn’t a framebuffer. It’s a pure ANSI text stream served over SSH](https://preview.redd.it/zid7f1oj8rdg1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bb5f62b6a06c28cdea735054d8782b262954ccf)\n\nThe second part is recovery. I integrated a local storage layer based on Btrfs that presents itself to the host as a normal USB drive, but internally keeps immutable, read-only snapshots. This is not meant for snapshotting an OS or doing live rollbacks. I use it purely as a resilient container for ISOs, rescue environments, and recovery scripts. Even if the host is compromised or wipes the drive, previous snapshots remain intact and readable, so recovery media doesn’t disappear when you need it most.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wec75zv3crdg1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d90c811d8b5c7b39c177ff05331f44158759c25\n\nThe goal wasn’t to replace existing KVMs or BMCs, but to have a reliable last-resort device that works without agents on the host, without relying on the OS, and without assuming the network or firmware stack is in a healthy state. It’s the thing I reach for when everything else has already failed and I just want my weekend back.\n\nI’ve been documenting the build and experiments as a personal devlog over at r/USBridge if anyone is curious about the internals.",

Since my device outputs raw text over SSH, your existing screen reader on the client side should be able to read the BIOS menus perfectly.\n\nI’m planning a small production run and a Kickstarter launch soon. Since this is a use case I really want to support, I'd love to get your input. Here is the pre-launch page:\n\n👉 [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/usbridge/usbridge-offline-kvm-with-bios-automation-and-snapshots](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/usbridge/usbridge-offline-kvm-with-bios-automation-and-snapshots)\n\nAnd genuinely - if you’re open to it, I’d love to hear more about your current workarounds (or lack thereof). Knowing exactly what barriers you face would help me ensure the text output works seamlessly with screen readers. Feel free to DM me if that's easier!",

The ANSI output is rendered from that stable, cached model rather than being re-derived from scratch every frame. That’s what avoids flicker, guessing, and timing issues, and makes it usable over SSH.\n\nIt’s intentionally focused on firmware and pre-OS environments where the UI is deterministic enough to be treated as text, not on general-purpose graphics.",

It touched on everything from running a hetrogenous Docker cluster to how I scanned receipts to automation around lighting.\n\nSo many things needed tweaking that although I noticed about a week later that videos served through Plex were looking kind of grainy, I took a really quick look at the settings, didn't see anything obviously wrong, and chalked it up to \"well, I upgraded both Plex and the Apple TV, there's probably some other setting I need to tweak\".  It went onto my \"todo eventually\" list (so I promptly forgot).  I mainly use Plex for streaming my music to PlexAmp, so video hasn't been a priority for me.  Until I tried to get things set up for my daughter to watch some shows I downloaded for her.  I was like, \"I took extra time to download HQ renditions of this stuff, why does this look like ass?\"  Checked it in VLC, and it looked perfect.   \n  \nThen I looked at Playback settings, and despite the global setting being to \"play original\" locally, once I started the video, it was set to 480p!  I tried checking \"play original\", but it just immediately snapped back to 480p. \n\nSearching this issue led to the suggestion to check the \"Network > Relay\" setting, and to monitor the dashboard while watching and see if it was streaming locally or remotely.  Sure enough, it was remote, and my Relay setting was indeed turned on:  \n  \n*\"The Relay allows connections to the server through a proxy relay when the server is not accessible otherwise. Note: this proxy relay is bandwidth limited.\"*\n\nI disabled the Relay, and then couldn't get to any of my media, which I thought was really weird since the server was local and configured to use the correct IP and port.  Then I remembered...  \n  \nAnother part of my upgrade was to reconfigure the UDM Pro to have a separate \"devices\" VLAN, primarily for IoT devices.  My Apple TV also lives on that network.  My Synology, which hosts the Plex server, lives on the secure VLAN.  My firewall rules explicitly forbid device traffic from hitting the secure network.\n\nIf I had no access to the media from the start, this would have been obvious, but the relay setting hid the mistake from me, and allowed things to seem to \"work\" by streaming everything remotely!\n\nI fixed the firewall rules, but also discovered that Plex still thought that it needed to go remote because of the different networks; Plex lived on 192.168.1.x and the AppleTV was on 192.168.2.x.  So, I also had to change the \"local networks\" setting (to 192.168.0.0/16 in my case).\n\nEverything plays locally again and I'm able to handle HD video from the fairly low-spec Synology fine, although it does seem to struggle a bit adding subtitles.\n\nAnyway, this is a pretty niche misconfiguration, but hopefully it will save someone a few minutes someday.",

This isn't theory - it's battle-tested knowledge that kept our services running through countless deployments.\n\n**What's in V1:**\n- Complete Swarm hierarchy explained\n- VPS requirements and cost planning across providers\n- DNS configuration (the #1 cause of Swarm issues)\n- Production-ready compose files and multi-stage Dockerfiles\n- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack\n- Platform comparison (Portainer, Dokploy, Coolify, CapRover, Dockge)\n- CI/CD versioning and deployment workflows\n- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TheDecipherist/docker-swarm-guide) with all configs\n\n---\n\n## Why Docker Swarm in 2026?\n\nBefore the Kubernetes crowd jumps in - yes, I know K8s exists. But here's the thing: **Docker Swarm is still incredibly relevant in 2026**, especially for small-to-medium teams who want container orchestration without the complexity overhead.\n\nSwarm advantages:\n- Native Docker integration (no YAML hell beyond compose files)\n- Significantly lower learning curve\n- Perfect for 2-20 node clusters\n- Built-in service discovery and load balancing\n- Rolling updates out of the box\n- Works with your existing Docker Compose files (mostly)\n\nIf you're not running thousands of microservices across multiple data centers, Swarm might be exactly what you need.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding the Docker Swarm Hierarchy\n\n```\nSwarm → Nodes → Stacks → Services → Tasks (Containers)\n```\n\n- **Swarm**: Your entire cluster. Only works with **pre-built images** - no `docker build` in production.\n- **Nodes**: Managers (handle state/scheduling) and Workers (run containers). Use 3 or 5 managers for HA.\n- **Stacks**: Groups of related services from a compose file.\n- **Services**: Manage replicas, rolling updates, health monitoring, auto-restart.\n- **Tasks**: A Task = Container. 6 replicas = 6 tasks.\n\n---\n\n## VPS Requirements & Cost Planning\n\nDocker Swarm is lightweight - minimal overhead compared to Kubernetes.\n\n### Infrastructure Presets\n\n| Preset | Nodes | Layout | Min Specs (per node) | Use Case |\n|--------|-------|--------|---------------------|----------|\n| **Minimal** | 1 | 1 manager | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 25GB | Dev/testing only |\n| **Basic** | 2 | 1 manager + 1 worker | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 50GB | Small production |\n| **Standard** | 3 | 1 manager + 2 workers | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB | Standard production |\n| **HA** | 5 | 3 managers + 2 workers | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB | High availability |\n\n### Approximate Monthly Costs (2025/2026)\n\n| Provider | Basic (2 nodes) | Standard (3 nodes) | HA (5 nodes) |\n|----------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| **Hetzner** | ~€8-12 | ~€20-30 | ~€40-60 |\n| **Vultr** | ~$12-20 | ~$30-50 | ~$60-100 |\n| **DigitalOcean** | ~$16-24 | ~$40-60 | ~$80-120 |\n| **Linode** | ~$14-22 | ~$35-55 | ~$70-110 |\n\n**Why these numbers?**\n- **1GB RAM minimum**: Swarm itself uses ~100-200MB, but you need headroom for containers\n- **3 or 5 managers for HA**: Raft consensus requires odd numbers for quorum\n- **2 vCPU for production**: Single core gets bottlenecked during deployments\n\n### My Recommendation\n\nFor most small-to-medium teams:\n1. **Start with Basic (2 nodes)** - 1 manager + 1 worker on Vultr or Hetzner\n2. **Budget ~$20-40/month** for a production-ready setup\n3. **Add nodes as needed** - Swarm makes scaling easy\n\nIf you need HA from day one, the **Standard (3 nodes)** preset gives you redundancy without breaking the bank.\n\n### What About AWS/GCP/Azure?\n\nCloud giants work fine with Swarm, but:\n- **More expensive** for equivalent specs\n- **More complexity** (VPCs, security groups, IAM)\n- **Better if** you need other AWS services (RDS, S3, etc.)\n\nWe run Swarm on AWS EC2 because we're already deep in the AWS ecosystem. If you're starting fresh, a dedicated VPS provider is simpler and cheaper.\n\n---\n\n## Setting Up Your Production Environment\n\n### Install Docker (Ubuntu)\n\n```bash\n# Add Docker's official GPG key and repo\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg\nsudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg\n\necho \"deb [arch=\"$(dpkg --print-architecture)\" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo \"$VERSION_CODENAME\") stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n```\n\n**Important:** Use `docker compose` (space), not `docker-compose` (deprecated).\n\n### Initialize the Swarm\n\n```bash\n# Get your internal IP\nip addr\n\n# Initialize on manager (use YOUR internal IP)\ndocker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.10.1.141:2377 --listen-addr 10.10.1.141:2377\n\n# Join token for workers (save this!)\ndocker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-xxxxx... 10.10.1.141:2377\n```\n\n**Critical:** Use a fixed IP for advertise address. Dynamic IPs will break your cluster on restart.\n\n---\n\n## DNS Configuration (This Will Save You Hours)\n\n**CRITICAL**: DNS issues cause 90% of Swarm networking problems.\n\nEdit `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` on each node:\n\n```ini\n[Resolve]\nDNS=10.10.1.122 8.8.8.8\nDomains=~yourdomain.io\n```\n\nThen reboot. Docker runs its own DNS at `127.0.0.11` for container-to-container resolution.\n\n**Rule:** Never hardcode IPs in Swarm. Use service names - Docker handles routing.\n\n---\n\n## Network Configuration\n\nCreate an overlay network (mandatory for multi-node):\n\n```bash\ndocker network create \\\n  --opt encrypted \\\n  --subnet 172.240.0.0/24 \\\n  --gateway 172.240.0.254 \\\n  --attachable \\\n  --driver overlay \\\n  awsnet\n```\n\n| Flag | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `--opt encrypted` | IPsec encryption. Optional but recommended. **Note:** Can cause issues with NAT - use internal VPC IPs |\n| `--subnet` | Prevents conflicts with VPC ranges |\n| `--attachable` | Allows standalone containers to connect |\n\n### Required Ports\n\n- **TCP 2377**: Cluster management\n- **TCP/UDP 7946**: Node communication\n- **TCP/UDP 4789**: Overlay network traffic\n\n---\n\n## Production Compose File\n\n```yaml\nversion: \"3.8\"\n\nservices:\n  nodeserver:\n    dns:\n      - 10.10.1.122\n    init: true  # Proper signal handling, zombie cleanup\n\n    environment:\n      - NODE_ENV=production\n      - API_KEY=${API_KEY}\n\n    deploy:\n      mode: replicated\n      replicas: 6\n      placement:\n        max_replicas_per_node: 3\n      update_config:\n        parallelism: 2\n        delay: 10s\n        failure_action: rollback\n        order: start-first\n      rollback_config:\n        parallelism: 2\n        delay: 10s\n      restart_policy:\n        condition: on-failure\n        delay: 5s\n        max_attempts: 3\n        window: 120s\n      resources:\n        limits:\n          cpus: '0.50'\n          memory: 400M\n        reservations:\n          cpus: '0.20'\n          memory: 150M\n\n    image: \"yourregistry/nodeserver:latest\"\n    ports:\n      - \"61339\"\n    networks:\n      awsnet:\n    secrets:\n      - app_secrets\n\nsecrets:\n  app_secrets:\n    external: true\n\nnetworks:\n  awsnet:\n    external: true\n```\n\n**Key settings:**\n- `init: true` - Runs tini as PID 1 for proper signal handling\n- `failure_action: rollback` - Auto-rollback on failed deployments\n- `order: start-first` - New containers start before old ones stop (zero downtime)\n- **Always set resource limits** - A runaway container can kill your node\n\n---\n\n## Dockerfile Best Practices\n\n### Multi-Stage Build (Node.js)\n\n```dockerfile\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\nFROM node:20-bookworm-slim AS base\nWORKDIR /app\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3 make g++ && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nCOPY package.json package-lock.json ./\n\nFROM base AS compiled\nRUN npm ci --omit=dev\n\nFROM node:20-bookworm-slim AS final\nRUN ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --from=compiled /app/node_modules /app/node_modules\nCOPY . .\nEXPOSE 3000\nENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"./server.js\"]\n```\n\n**Why multi-stage?** Build tools stay in temp stage. Final image is clean and small.\n\n### Key Rules\n\n1. **Run in foreground** - `CMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]` (official nginx image handles this)\n2. **Pin base images** - `FROM ubuntu:22.04` not `FROM ubuntu:latest`\n3. **Include health checks** - Swarm uses these for rolling updates\n4. **Use .dockerignore** - Exclude `.env`, `node_modules`, `.git`\n\n### Sample .dockerignore\n\n```\n.git\n.gitignore\n.env\n.env.*\nnode_modules\nnpm-debug.log\nDockerfile*\ndocker-compose*\n.dockerignore\n*.md\n.vscode\n.idea\n```\n\nThis keeps your build context small and prevents secrets from accidentally ending up in images.\n\n---\n\n## Monitoring Stack (Prometheus + Grafana)\n\nFull compose file in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TheDecipherist/docker-swarm-guide). Key points:\n\n| Service | Purpose | Mode |\n|---------|---------|------|\n| Grafana | Dashboards | 1 replica on manager |\n| Prometheus | Metrics collection | 1 replica on manager |\n| cAdvisor | Container metrics | Global (all nodes) |\n| Node Exporter | Host metrics | Global (all nodes) |\n\nUse `mode: global` for monitoring agents - runs ONE instance on EVERY node.\n\n**Quick setup tip:** Start with cAdvisor + Node Exporter first. Add Prometheus when you need historical data. Add Grafana when you need pretty dashboards for your team.\n\n---\n\n## Docker Management Platforms\n\nManaging Swarm via CLI is powerful, but GUIs improve visibility significantly.\n\n### Portainer\n\n**Best for:** Teams wanting visual management without changing workflows.\n\n```bash\n# Deploy Portainer agent on each node\ndocker service create --name portainer_agent \\\n  --publish mode=host,target=9001,published=9001 \\\n  --mode global \\\n  --mount type=bind,src=//var/run/docker.sock,dst=/var/run/docker.sock \\\n  --mount type=bind,src=//var/lib/docker/volumes,dst=/var/lib/docker/volumes \\\n  portainer/agent:latest\n\n# Deploy Portainer server on manager\ndocker service create --name portainer \\\n  --publish 9443:9443 --publish 8000:8000 \\\n  --replicas=1 --constraint 'node.role == manager' \\\n  --mount type=volume,src=portainer_data,dst=/data \\\n  portainer/portainer-ce:latest\n```\n\n**Pricing:** CE is completely free with no node limits. Business Edition adds enterprise features.\n\n**Why Portainer?** It shows you container logs, resource usage, network topology, and lets you manage stacks visually. Perfect for teams where not everyone is a CLI wizard.\n\n### Platform Comparison\n\n| Platform | Swarm Support | Git Deploy | Auto SSL | Best For |\n|----------|---------------|------------|----------|----------|\n| **Portainer** | Full | No | No | Visual management |\n| **Dokploy** | Full | Yes | Yes | Heroku-style on Swarm |\n| **Coolify** | Experimental | Yes | Yes | 280+ templates, great UI |\n| **CapRover** | Full (native) | Yes | Yes | Proven Swarm PaaS |\n| **Dockge** | None | No | No | Simple Compose management |\n\n**My setup:** Portainer for visibility + custom CI/CD + Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.\n\n**Note on Coolify:** Their Swarm support is experimental. Works for basic setups but I've hit edge cases. Great project though - watch this space.\n\n---\n\n## Secret Management\n\n**Stop using environment variables for secrets.**\n\n```yaml\nsecrets:\n  app_secrets:\n    external: true  # Created via CLI or Portainer\n\nservices:\n  app:\n    secrets:\n      - app_secrets\n```\n\nCreate secrets:\n```bash\ndocker secret create app_secrets ./secrets.json\n```\n\nSecrets appear as files in `/run/secrets/SECRET_NAME`. They're encrypted at rest, not visible in `docker inspect`, and only sent to nodes that need them.\n\n---\n\n## CI/CD Versioning\n\n```bash\nBUILD_VERSION=$(cat ./buildVersion.txt)\nLONG_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)\n\ndocker compose build --build-arg GIT_COMMIT=$LONG_COMMIT --build-arg BUILD_VERSION=$BUILD_VERSION\ndocker compose push\ndocker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack\n```\n\n**Never use `latest` in production.** Use commit hashes or semantic versions.\n\n**Why versioning matters:**\n- Rollback becomes a one-liner: `docker service update --image yourapp:v1.2.3 mystack_app`\n- You know exactly what's running on each node\n- Audit trails for compliance\n- No more \"but it worked on my machine\" mysteries\n\n---\n\n## Useful Commands\n\n```bash\n# Node management\ndocker node ls                                              # List all nodes\ndocker node update --availability=drain docker2.domain.io   # Maintenance mode\ndocker node update --availability=active docker2.domain.io  # Back to active\ndocker node inspect docker2.domain.io --pretty              # Node details\n\n# Stack operations\ndocker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack   # Deploy/update stack\ndocker stack services mystack                       # List services in stack\ndocker stack ps mystack                             # List tasks (containers)\ndocker stack rm mystack                             # Remove stack\n\n# Service operations\ndocker service scale mystack_web=4                  # Scale to 4 replicas\ndocker service logs -f mystack_web                  # Follow logs\ndocker service logs --tail 100 mystack_web          # Last 100 lines\ndocker service update --force mystack_web           # Force redeploy\ndocker service update --image yourapp:v2 mystack_web  # Update image\n\n# Debugging\ndocker service ps mystack_web --no-trunc            # Full error messages\ndocker inspect $(docker ps -q -f name=mystack_web)  # Container details\n```\n\n**Pro tip:** `docker stack deploy` is idempotent. Run it again to update - no need to `rm` first.\n\n---\n\n## Common Gotchas\n\nThese issues have cost me hours. Learn from my pain.\n\n**Containers can't communicate between nodes:**\n1. Verify overlay network exists: `docker network ls`\n2. Check it's attached to your service in compose file\n3. Verify DNS config in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` on each node\n4. Ensure ports 7946 (TCP/UDP) and 4789 (UDP) are open between nodes\n5. If using `--opt encrypted`, try without it first (NAT issues)\n\n**Service stuck in \"Pending\":**\n```bash\ndocker service ps myservice --no-trunc\n```\nCommon causes:\n- Resource constraints - scheduler can't find a node with enough CPU/memory\n- Image doesn't exist or can't be pulled (check registry auth)\n- Placement constraints can't be satisfied\n- All nodes are drained or paused\n\n**Rolling update hangs:**\nHealth checks are usually the culprit. Your container might be healthy but Swarm doesn't know it.\n\n```yaml\nhealthcheck:\n  test: [\"CMD\", \"curl\", \"-f\", \"http://localhost:3000/health\"]\n  interval: 30s\n  timeout: 10s\n  retries: 3\n  start_period: 60s  # Give your app time to start!\n```\n\n**\"No such network\" errors:**\nCreate networks BEFORE deploying stacks:\n```bash\ndocker network create --driver overlay --attachable mynetwork\ndocker stack deploy -c compose.yml mystack\n```\n\n**Secrets not updating:**\nSecrets are immutable. To update:\n1. Create new secret with different name: `docker secret create app_secrets_v2 ./secrets.json`\n2. Update compose to reference new secret name\n3. Redeploy stack\n\n---\n\n## Final Tips\n\n1. **Use Portainer** - Free and makes Swarm management much easier. Deploy it first.\n2. **Always use external networks** - Create overlay networks before deploying stacks\n3. **Tag images properly** - Never `latest` in production. Use commit hashes or semver.\n4. **Set resource limits** - Always. A runaway container will take down your node.\n5. **Test your rollback** - Deploy a broken image intentionally to verify auto-rollback works\n6. **Monitor from day one** - Prometheus + Grafana is free and catches issues early\n7. **Document your setup** - Future you will thank present you\n8. **Start small** - 2 nodes is enough to learn. Scale when you need it.\n\n---\n\n## Backup Your Swarm State\n\nSwarm state lives on manager nodes. Back it up:\n\n```bash\n# Stop Docker (on manager)\nsudo systemctl stop docker\n\n# Backup the Swarm state\nsudo tar -cvzf swarm-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /var/lib/docker/swarm\n\n# Start Docker\nsudo systemctl start docker\n```\n\nStore backups off-node. If all managers die simultaneously (rare but possible), this is your recovery path.\n\n---\n\n## When NOT to Use Swarm\n\nTo be fair, Swarm isn't always the answer:\n\n- **Need advanced scheduling?** K8s has more sophisticated options\n- **Running 50+ services?** K8s ecosystem is more mature at scale\n- **Need service mesh?** Istio/Linkerd integrate better with K8s\n- **Team already knows K8s?** Stick with what you know\n\nFor everything else - small teams, 2-20 nodes, wanting to move fast - Swarm is hard to beat.\n\n---\n\n## GitHub Repo\n\nAll compose files, Dockerfiles, and configs mentioned in this guide:\n\n**[github.com/TheDecipherist/docker-swarm-guide](https://github.com/TheDecipherist/docker-swarm-guide)**\n\nThe repo includes:\n- Complete monitoring stack compose file\n- Production-ready multi-stage Dockerfiles\n- Network configuration examples\n- Portainer deployment scripts\n\n---\n\n## What's Coming in V2\n\nBased on community feedback, V2 will cover:\n- Deep dive into monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog comparison)\n- Blue-green deployments in Swarm\n- Logging strategies (ELK, Loki, etc.)\n- Traefik integration for automatic SSL\n\n---\n\n*What's your Swarm setup?

Not throwing shades to who clean tables, it's to give a clear example of the difference in background and how that matters. \n\nAlso, some projects have some really strict checks for code quality and, guess what, have AI bots enforce them by doing quick code reviews before a PR is marked for review by the maintainers (see Actual Budget for example).",

It's not true lossless from source, but it's the highest quality YouTube offers, in a container that plays nicely with most music servers\n\nPlease do not do this. I need to you understand that if the *source is lossy*, converting to FLAC does nothing except waste processing power; converting is not magic, you know? The whole point of FLAC storage is that it's a *lossless* format, that you can then transcode to aac/opus/mp3. Not the other way around. This sort of thing is why I have to do frequency analysis of downloaded FLACS to make sure they're... actually FLACs and not mp3s in a trench coat.\n\nThe quality damage (artifacts) from lossy compression is already done if you download from a lossy source like youtube. Just keep it in the original format.",

I want a setup that lets me manage my own library but still keeps some of the *discovery* features I’m used to from streaming services.\n\nFrom what I understand so far, **Navidrome** seems like the best core solution for this. I’ve seen that it supports lyrics (even synced/karaoke-style in some clients) and has a “radio” feature based on my own library.\n\nWhat I’m still not fully clear about is the **recommendation/discovery side**:\n\n* Is there any way to get recommendations *based on my listening habits*, similar to Spotify’s daily mixes or weekly discovery playlists?\n* More specifically: can it suggest **music I don’t already own** (artists/albums/tracks outside my library), so I can then look them up and decide whether to buy or add them?\n* Are there plugins, integrations or external tools that people commonly use alongside Navidrome to cover this gap?\n\nI’m constantly searching for new music, so discovery is important to me. I don’t expect a 1:1 Spotify replacement, but I’d like to know what’s realistically possible in a self-hosted setup and how others handle this.\n\nWould love to hear how you’ve built your workflow and what clients or services you pair with Navidrome.\n\nThanks!",

We all use what works for us and while some of us may use some the purest of pure solution for one thing, we don't necessarily have to do that for everything we host. We do what works for us. Self host is a spectrum not a binary state. It's meaningful to host your own server and your own media, even if plex is handling authentication.\n\nI think your message would land better for more people if you focused more on Jellyfin's genuine strengths and less on what Plex lacks in your mind.",

Those are things families *notice*, and their tolerance for it is *way* lower than the self-hoster.\n\nBoth Plex and Emby passed everyone's sniff tests immediately. Native, consistent, smooth, professional-looking client apps.\n\nJellyfin is basically a great back-end application with a weak set of made-in-mom's-basement-looking front-end clients, which unfortunately makes it a very poor sales piece for both self-hosting and FOSS, as opposed to things like Immich and Home-Assistant, which have family-friendly polish at all layers, or Navidrome and similar which have a lot of good client options out there.\n\nMaybe someday Jellyfin will get there, and I have seen *some* recent movement on the app front, but right now it just feels like a religious movement.\n\n(I also personally care very little whether it's OSS or not.

My media is now harder to find in the UI and it's getting buried in the content they get paid for. I know it's a decision they're making to try to be a successful business, but I like it less and less as time goes on. \n\nI haven't used jellyfin enough to have an informed opinion on it and whether I'm going to like the experience overall, but I can say 100 percent I love the simplicity of the UI.

I will just use Jellyfin until the internet is back up. Also, between Plex server updates my ability to download media to a device has been broken more often than not, so I just use Jellyfin to download media to a device when I travel if I need to.\n\nMost of the users I’ve shared library access to have chosen to use Plex, if that means anything. And I favor the Plex menus and searching over Jellyfin. Media also begins playing faster after I press play in Plex, and I can choose a different quality at which to transcode before the media even fuller buffers in Plex, and struggle to do that in Jellyfin on iOS. After the media is playing, I think Jellyfin is slightly faster when scrubbing through media, but that might just be because of trickplay.\n\nBoth Plex and Jellyfin are on the same server dedicated solely to them, and share the same Intel Arc A310 between them. I can transcode without any issues in either app, and don’t have any issues with multiple transcodes in either app. At the end of the day, I still favor Plex, but wouldn’t mind Jellyfin at all if that’s all I was able to use for some reason.",

However there were playback issues using direct play with 4k content on all of my devices despite being perfectly fine with every other player not to mention the recent update caused general performance issues and stopped me being able to play my book libraries so I started trying Emby; it's my favourite so far! It has everything I liked from Jellyfin in terms of customisation and lack of third party sign-in with the flawless playback from Plex.

My experience with it was not really all that pleasant.\n\nI have a Kobo that I bought originally to work with the sideload mode because I like to have access to my books without any sort of provider account. I set up Booklore only to find out that a Kobo account is mandatory and that users were getting locked out recently because they hadn't accepted some Kobo terms and conditions.\n\nIn addition the UI was super sluggish and the whole project is way too AI-friendly for me to feel comfortable with it. \n\nWhile I don't object to telemetry, default-on, opt-out telemetry that pings on first launch and only has mentions burried in documentation just feels... I dunno, off-putting. Again, no hate against telemetry, as a career dev I understand its importance, the way it was implemented just adds to a layer of papercuts I had attempting to run it.\n\nIn the end I ditched it for a simple Calibre + Calibre-Web stack and I couldn't be happier. It doesn't need a Kobo account to sync and the UI is, imho, a lot simpler and easier to navigate.\n\nJust my experience at least.\n\nedit: to be clear, [Calibre-Web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) is not the same as [Calibre-Web-Automated](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated), and neither are the same as the upstream [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) that they both rely on.

Since then, I haven’t had much time to actually read on it because most of my time has gone into building and improving Booklore. It’s very possible that Kobo firmware updates over time introduced behavior I haven’t been able to keep up with. Booklore has also grown pretty quickly, and as a mostly solo maintainer (with help from the community), it’s been hard to keep every feature perfectly polished.\n\nAbout the UI feeling sluggish, you’re not wrong. If you have a very large library (thousands or tens of thousands of books), things can start to feel heavy. The UI wasn’t originally designed for that scale, and I’m planning backend pagination to address this more properly. For now, you can turn off the right filter bar to reduce the sluggishness many folds.\n\nOn telemetry: I totally get why default-on, opt-out feels uncomfortable. For clarity, Booklore only sends very basic, non-identifiable stats after 24 hours (library size, book types, etc.). No personal or identifiable data is collected, but I understand how the implementation can still feel off-putting.  \nWhat's data is collected is clearly mentioned in the documentation: [https://booklore.org/docs/tools/telemetry](https://booklore.org/docs/tools/telemetry)",

                  "text": "Hey, I appreciate you taking the time to respond to some of my frustrations.\n\nRegarding my Kobo experience, I totally understand resource and development constraints. I have been a lurker in this subreddit for a number of years and have watched your success grow pretty fast; the reason why I started my comment with confusion regarding community opinion was because I've read quite a lot of praise for Booklore here and it was jarring and unfortunate that my experience was very much not the same as what often seems to be the common opinion here.\n\nFor me personally a Kobo mandatory account is a non-starter, but I also already run Audiobookshelf in production for a long time and I have been exploring Calibre/Booklore exclusively for Kobo sync; ultimately I came to the conclusion that I'm just probably not your intended audience at this stage as it's an admittedly narrow use case.\n\nI'm in DevOps by trade so I'm used to thoroughly reading documentation before standing up services. I had a good read of your telemetry page before considering Booklore. While I understand that user analytics and telemetry is a subjective topic, a number of your choices left a sour taste in my mouth regarding implementation.\n\nChiefly, it is both opt-out, *and* cannot be modified by environment variable. This means that functionally an admin has to actively go and flick a switch in a UI after it's already running, by which time unless they have also blocked external network access to Booklore (unlikely), means telemetry would have already been sent potentially without their explicit knowledge.\n\nCompounding on this is the fact there is no mention at all of telemetry in the primary Github README, which itself includes installation instructions, and 'analytics' on that page only refers to the repository itself. Similarly, there is no mention of either in the primary installation instructions of the documentation site, although I do appreciate at least the telemetry page is unfurled by default on the sidebar. I personally still find this unsatisfactory however, as it can be misleading to users who are not as diligent, as seen by users here who've mentioned they were not aware of the analytics prior. The effective flow for an admin who only follows the primary installation instructions regardless of Git or docs is that they finish the instructions, create and log into an admin account, and immediately start using it.\n\nTo me, these choices in combination toe the line between \"just transparent enough\" and \"how much can I get away with\", and that's just not really a game I like to play when hosting services for myself and others. I would have personally felt a lot less put off if:\n\n* it was possible to opt out via environment variable\n* there was any mention of consent in the two primary pages sourced for installation instructions\n\nAnecdotally, I set up all containers by default with no external network access as a security best practice. While I believe more admins here should do the same in general, I do not believe it should be the only effective method of opting out of your analytics at initial runtime if an admin wishes so.\n\nWhile I have been rather critical, I hope you can take the above as constructive and in good faith. I wish you the best of luck and hope Booklore continues to improve. The simple fact that *either* project can effectively hack a Kobo like this is pretty magical stuff on its own. More minds and projects in the open source space only fuels improvement and innovation. While Calibre-Web is the clear solution for me and my users, it's undeniable that Booklore has a pretty passionate and adoring community.\n\nedit: while an env var is still imho the more appropriate implementation for configuring analytics opt-ins/outs, if you are really attached to managing it entirely via the UI then even a small hover text in the initial admin creation screen that says *\"We use analytics to improve Booklore, [learn more](https://booklore.org/docs/tools/telemetry)\"* would be a significant step to improving the informed consent of your admin users.",

              "text": "FWIW I am using both Calibre-Web-Automated and Booklore, and I find Booklore easier to use when you have multiple Kindles with associated email addresses that you're sending to. You can essentially add multiple recipients and choose one, which iirc works fine straight in Calibre, but is different in Calibre Web and its forks. In CWA I needed additional burner accounts just to assign a send-to-kindle email address to it.\n\nUltimately Booklore isn't doing much for a single user that old-school Calibre can't do, at least that I have found. Where it does excel, is ease-of-use for multiple users AND remote access - expose it publicly, configure OIDC / passkey auth / SSO with your other services, and suddenly your users can easily sync their own Kobo shelves or send-to Kindles if they so choose. Just not as simple with Calibre-Web.\n\nIt's still missing a lot of features but I think it has promise. Plus, I think it looks more modern than most of the alternatives, and especially more-so than Calibre. Which is not a requirement, but kind of nice.\n\nETA: I also don't have any performance issues on a low-power machine, but the Booklore DB is on an NVME.",

I have been exploring Booklore/Calibre purely for Kobo support.\n\nWhile I would love for Calibre-Web to have OIDC support, I run everything behind Authentik already so the combination of LDAP + proxy header authentication functionally gives me SSO and easy user management which was not difficult to set up.\n\nI will admit that I did not troubleshoot my UI lag in great detail. Maybe it's a Firefox thing or a PEBCAC thing. Once I learned that a Kobo account was mandatory, Booklore was a non-starter for me and I did not progress with it further",

It's great for carrying around but I usually just read in bed. \n\nMy next e-reader will definitely be a Kobo unless something drastic changes and readers suddenly change for some reason. I've looked at the color versions but they don't appeal to me much as they are quite dark unless the brightness is turned up, which affects battery life a bit. \n\nBeing able to buy books from (pretty much) wherever is great and being able to link to my library is a huge bonus as well. \n\nI just can't see myself going back to a kindle at this point.\n\n\nAs for hooking it up to booklore, I found it quite easy.

I just followed the instructions [here on the booklore docs](https://booklore.org/docs/integration/kobo#%EF%B8%8F-step-1-enable-kobo-sync-in-booklore) I think you can do it by IP but I haven't had to try it. It's worked pretty flawlessly for me.",
