To OP: you've taken my docker virginity. Just FYI.\n\nEdit3: It also blows my desktop power consumption up by 30-40w, just having the browser open to watch... jesus christ man, this is a glorious waste of CPU cycles and power on 2 machines at once. \n\nEdit: I am also very excite because I realize this gives me a new thing to watch in my brand new power consumption graphs. Line goes up higher and skips around more, very excite. Unlike when that happened last night because I installed synapse in the wrong terminal window on the wrong machine and didn't have time to check the strange 10w power jump till breakfast. Wait what am I saying, that was also fun. It proved the utility of my new gadgets! Just like this uselessly perfect container will do.",

Traditionally the Torrent protocol would have you download a torrent file which contains some trackers which all the related peers of that torrent connect to so they can find out about each other. DHT is practically the same with seed nodes. (Even torrent clients use DHT now though I haven't specifically checked how they discover their initial peers...)\n\nI suppose we could technically solve that problem once and for all by introducing a (this is very stupid) scan of the entire ipv4 address space in a random order using a fiestel cipher and random seed to enumerate them all in a small memory footprint until the client finds its first peer(s) as a bootstrap to the rest of the network. Then it can save them for next time. But again, really stupid.",

This is neat, and it's a fun way to add ~10w at a time, per container, for power monitoring automation prototyping. The first thing that ever convinced me to muck with docker. Finally.

Thanks for making cool number thing.\n\nnew actual edit: it's wooorking, we're in the thousands.

It is truly a testament to the vigilance required in this modern, LLM-saturated epoch. However, I must respectfully posit that the 'disjointed' nature you observe is not a symptom of artificial generation, but rather the direct result of a sleep-deprived homelabber trying to manage a decentralized swarm of imaginary friends while simultaneously debugging a YAML file that has no right to be this broken.\n\nTo address your concern regarding the stylistic inconsistency: You have to understand that when one commits to the bit of creating 'the most pointless deployment ever made,' one's mental state tends to fragment. It is a form of method acting, really. One moment, I am the Architect of the Swarm, speaking in the grandiloquent, marketing-heavy tones of a cyberpunk villain to sell the concept of a useless DHT counter. The next, I am a humble, caffeine-addled user staring at `htop`, wondering why a Node.js process needs 113MB of resident memory to count to the number 18, and speaking in the frantic, lower-case dialect of a sysadmin who has realized they’ve made a terrible mistake.\n\nYou ask, 'Can't people just write their own shit?' This is a profound philosophical question. In a decentralized network, does any single node truly 'write' anything, or are we merely propagating the gossip of the swarm? Is the 'shit' I am writing truly mine, or is it a derivative work of the 400 other Reddit threads I’ve read this week about reverse proxies? The oscillation you see in my tone—the 30-40 node wobble, if you will—is not a hallucination of a Large Language Model, but the natural variance of a human brain operating on too little sleep and too much Docker documentation.\n\nFurthermore, if I *were* an AI, I would like to think I would be programmed to be more consistent, or at least programmed to use less RAM. The fact that my posting history looks like three different people fighting over a keyboard is, ironically, the greatest proof of my humanity. An algorithm seeks patterns; a homelabber seeks only to complicate their own life for no reason.\n\nTL;DR: The disjointedness is a feature, not a bug. It’s not AI, it’s just ADHD and a really stupid project.\n\n  \n~~-chatgpt~~",

I did this mostly for Frigate, which I’m running in HA.  This has been a lot of fun, as I’ve now got various automations running based on face and object recognition from my cameras. \n\nThe other I’m moving to an N5 Pro with 5x 22TB drives and 96gb RAM (I was able to get everything before the most recent price spikes).   I played around with switching OSes, tried both TrueNAS and Unraid for a bit, but ultimately I’m sticking with OMV.  So far all I’ve moved over is my media stack, Plex and arr stuff.  I’ll be moving document and backup services over to it soon.  Then the big next step and reason for that hardware will be to play with some local LLMs.  \n\nI’m also switching ISPs and will soon have 8gb fiber which is going to kick ass, but even better than the bandwidth is I’ll finally have full control over the router vs my current ISPs super locked down BS.  So once that’s in place I’ll be setting up AdGuard or Pihole which I haven’t had in a decade.  From there I’m looking forward to exploring a bunch of other network stuff that will be new to me. \n\nHopefully I’ll be all done in Jan and I’ll probably write up a complete overview.",

I also have a Synology DS414, which was my old NAS, before building the server, now it's backup to UnRAID - as it's so old it only supports up to 4TB drives. My UnRAID server has 4x 6TB drives for NAS duty, and 2x NVME drives for docker containers/caching. My Unifi network is ran entirely off my Unifi Cloud Gateway Max, which is disconnected from Unifi's cloud to keep everything local, I have that device, along with 1 5-port 2.5GbE switch, 1x 8-port PoE 1GB switch (for Reolink PoE security cameras), 1 Unifi U6LR on the back porch for outside coverage (my house basically has no cell coverage where I live on any US carrier), 1 Unifi U7 Pro inside the house for WiFi. I have a Pi Rack of a Raspberry Pi 5 8GB, Raspberry Pi 4, Pi 2 and Banana Pi, the Pi 2 and Banana Pi aren't doing much of anything at the moment, and the Pi 4 I have to re-configure since moving to the Pi 5, or find another use for it.\n\nThe only things I want to add are Lidarr for some music, immich for all my SLR photos (I do photography as a hobby on the side - shoot on Canon mirrorless), and I need to figure out a good NVR solution for my Reolink cameras. I tried shinobi and frigate and couldn't get them working properly, but that could have just been me lol. I'm open to suggestions for a good NVR I can run on UnRAID - since that's my storage anyway.\n\nOh and I have Wireguard running on the Unifi Cloud Gateway for remote access, as well as OpenVPN on the Synology (how I VPN'ed in prior to getting the Unifi CGM last month)",

          "text": "Happy new year!  This year was mainly one of learning in the self-hosted space for me, I had a couple month break while I was job searching where I really honed in a lot on learning what I could to keep my skills sharp.\n\nBefore this year, I was mostly living in the realm of debian VMs running Proxmox, that I would deploy docker compose files to.  I really wanted to learn kubernetes, so I initially started out with setting up k3s, and I eventually got my normal \\*arr + jellyfin, forgejo, and vaultwarden stack up, with support from Traefik as a reverse proxy, Cert Manager, Longhorn for storage, etc\n\nThen I heard of NixOS, and the idea of a purely declarative environment was really appealing to me.  I went with hosting my services baremetal for a little bit, and that led to learning a lot about Linux networking through configuring systemd-networkd...and I even got a cheap mini PC with dual 10G ethernet ports and setup a custom router with nftables for firewall, kea DHCP, and blocky for ad-blocking DNS.\n\nI also got a Framework Desktop with the AMD Strix Halo platform, and I had a decent time experimenting with local LLMs using ollama's ROCm support.\n\nBut then I decided I wanted to go back to the world of containers.  So I've reinstalled Proxmox on my servers, got them in a cluster with ceph, and I've got a set of Terraform modules that spin up and configure an HA cluster with Talos.\n\nThis time I really wanted to dive further into k8s stuff, so I'm doing the whole works:\n\n* cilium CNI with Gateway API support (still using CertManager with a letsencrypt DNS-01 challenge for now)\n* rook-ceph CSI (connecting to the ceph setup in proxmox)\n* CloudNativePG for replicated database\n* one of ArgoCD / Flux for Gitops\n* SSO with Authentik (which I had setup briefly in my original incarnation of the k8s stuff in k3s, but didn't get to explore the full potential of)\n\nSo far, Talos' documentation is excellent, and there are some things I didn't quite figure out in bare-metal k3s land in NixOS that I already have a better idea of for when I get to them (hardware accelerated transcoding in Jellyfin being a big one)\n\nOf course the plan is still to host my normal services, but I still have a little bit to go on the infrastructure side before I'll be ready for that.  First will be Forgejo and Gitops, then Vaultwarden restored from my backup, then the media stack, then install Talos bare-metal on the Framework Desktop.  \n  \nThere are some services I've had my eye on that I wanted to hold off on implementing until I was more comfortable with my infrastructure.  Forefront of my mind for these would be:  \n\n* Paperless-NGX for document uploads (especially potentially leveraging full-text search with some LLMs maybe)\n* Immich for photos\n* Likely tailscale for outside of network access\n\nI also have a couple smaller apps I'll be writing up that I intend to host, things like custom Discord bots and such.\n\nI've also had HomeAssistant running on a raspberry pi for a little bit, but I haven't explored the possibilities with that as much as I'd like\n\n  \nHardware is two beefy custom built servers in Fractal Design tower cases with too many hard drive slots, a minisforum ms-01 (mostly as the lighter weight 3rd node for HA stuff like proxmox cluster, ceph, cnpg, etc), the Framework Desktop.  I also have an old system76 meerkat I'll probably use as a single proxmox node to host a development cluster where I can try things out",

          "text": "\nHere is my 2025 stack. Honestly, I try to keep it as simple as possible, though \"*simple*\" is relative!\n\n* **Komodo** – **Infrastructure management.** After 4 years of Portainer, I migrated because I was losing track of the source of truth for my stacks. With Komodo's two-way git sync, my Git repo is *always* the source of truth, no matter where I change the config. I run the Core in Docker, but the Periphery agents run on systemd, automated with Ansible and GitHub Actions so they update themselves regularly.\n\n\n* **Keerakeep & Linkwarden** – **Bookmark managers.** I find myself swapping often between these two.\n\n\n* **Passbolt & Vaultwarden** – **Password managers.** I run them both as copies of each other, as each has distinct pros and cons. I cannot pick one yet, so I'll see what kind of features they release next year.\n\n\n* **AdGuard Home & Tailscale** – **Network & Privacy.** I don't use commercial VPNs, but this combo helps significantly fight browser fingerprinting. I mainly use DoH in round-robin, and I like the results I get while browsing the web.\n\n\n* **Traefik, Caddy & Pangolin** – **Reverse proxy and load balancing.** I use each of them differently, but usually, Traefik sits in front of Caddy.\n\n\n* **CrowdSec** – **Security and threat detection.** I sometimes write custom collections to limit API usage on specific apps. I’ve hooked CrowdSec into a self-hosted **VictoriaMetrics** instance and use **Grafana** to build threat detection dashboards that track all attacks and decisions. Since the community version of CrowdSec does not keep retention, this setup allows me to keep 2 years of decision history.\n\n\n* **Teable** – **Postgres frontend / Airtable alternative.** This is my main backend data storage and smart spreadsheet (moved here after 2 years on Baserow). I use it for books, movies, Oura habit tracking, and my LLM knowledge base.\n\n\n* **Metabase** – **Intelligence system.** Hooked directly into Teable to build dashboards on the data I'm collecting.\n\n\n* **n8n & Activepieces** – **Automation.** I use n8n with custom built Python modules for machine learning, feeding them data from Teable to make predictions.\n\n\n* **Actual Budget** – **Budget tracking.** The data is hooked into Teable and N8N for analysis.\n\n\n* **Restic** – **Backups.** I perform offsite backups to S3, dumping all Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB databases daily. Everything is encrypted. I keep 12 months of full backups and 7 days of incremental backups.\n\n\n* **Ghost CMS** – **Self-publishing.** I use a dual-CDN setup. Mainly I'm with Cloudflare, but it automatically switches to BunnyCDN if Cloudflare goes down (which seems to happen much more often lately).\n\n\n* **Element** – **Chat.** Self-hosted chat based on the Matrix protocol. I don't like the Chat Control initiative, so I'm ready to switch once the law is passed.\n\n\n* **SearXNG** – **Meta-search engine.** I have this configured as the default search engine in all my browsers.\n\n\n* **NTFY & Telegram** – **Notifications.** Sometimes I push notifications to my self-hosted NTFY, but other times I use AI agents to publish them directly to Telegram.\n\n---\n\n### Things to add in the future\n\n* **Immich or Photoprism:** For my pictures. They are going to hold my camera shots only (mainly my Fuji files and collections).\n\n\n* **Book Management:** I need a decent app to migrate my non-fiction books from Apple Books (epub format). I have tons of books but no idea where to hook them up. I tried Calibre but didn't like it. Open to suggestions.\n\n\n* **Encrypted File Storage:** A decent self-hosted app for file storage to replace my Proton Drive (approx 10GB library). Open to suggestions. Precedes the simplicity and security. NO nextcloud or similar.  Must use encryption at rest and file sharing, easy upload from a mobile device. \n\n\nP.S. Let me know if you have  good suggestions for the file storage or book apps.",

          "text": "UPDATE: Got asked about more build details\n...\nDid I follow a guide? \n\nNah, no existing guide. I'm a long ago high end IT support dude (Venture capital firms... essentially tech support for billionaires), so some of this stuff kind of made sense. \n\nI'll likely write up a decent build guide though....\n\nThe light version/story:\n\nI started by being annoyed that WD or any other company, ever produced a updated version of the amazing WD My Passport Wireless Pro, which is an amazing bit of media serving tech. 2tb HDD, two wifi adapters, 6+ hour battery, Plex server (direct play only), 1.4 lbs. \n\nMine still works, but it's 8 year old tech and just matter of time before it craps out. \n\nWhen I saw there was a case for $50 that would hold a Pi4 and 2.5\"HDD. I threw together essentially what I'd want a Passport replacement to have and had ai both evaluate it's feasibility and cost. And the result was a pretty amazing bit of possible kit, at around $180. \n\nAnd building the thing, physically and software stack looked kind of fun and manageable; with ai doing the heavy lifting in Linux. \n\nThe hardest SW bit by far, was automating the transcode of any existing and future media in my master library, that the PI can't direct play with Kodi, when connected to a TV via HDMI. That was all built and runs on my NAS, the result is 80% of my collection being already compatible and 20% being transcodes. All that is synced to the PI. \n\nThe other challenge was cutting the case bottom exactly right so I could fit/slide in the 15mm high 5tb drive, while still leaving the various screws and fasteners in place for the case to hold everything. The accuracy of cutting aluminum with an oscillating multi-tool, saved my ass there. With the tool, the cutting wasn't too hard. \n\nSorting out how powerbanks output reliable 5v 2amp power took awhile; as everything is hyped around Watts and etc. Turns out all of that stuff was irrelevant. What matters is: does it have a usb-a charging outlet, is it a reputable brand so you can believe their mah numbers and their claim it does passthrough. UGREEN seems to be the sweet spot. \n\nFinally, the awkward shape of the battery meant the thing would wobble and likely tip over all the time. So I used the existing screw holes on the bottom of the case with 30mm & 40mm standoff screws bolted to a sheet of aluminum the same size as the case to hold the battery under the thing. I got lucky that the battery fit to the exact mm, with no margin of error. F' me, whew. \n\nThe thing is just rad. To look at, hold and use. It's such a useful piece of kit.",

Navidrome, jellyfin, plex etc are popular and do the trick. If you want to collect listen stats or scrobble listens, it'd likely be better to integrate with those apps. Otherwise you're just going to have to create another streaming server, probably implement subsonic and then build a bunch of clients on top of that. \n\nIf your TV is turning off, there are plenty of Subsonic compatible players you should be able to use with Navidrome and Jellyfin and there's tons more clients for Jellyfin posted every other week. I'm not trying to discourage you from working on solving your problem, I just think you're focusing your efforts on the wrong thing. \n\nSo music acquisition is a good idea. And using ML to make vibe based suggestions is great. That's your strength you should play to. Most people who self host music struggle with discovery. \n\nThen the next thing is downloading. Lidarr already allows for downloads through plugins from virtually any platform, but using your app, the quality profile can't be controlled. Additionally, you did you own implementation of Soulseek with no documentation of how it works. It would've been better to rely on slskd so integrate with existing setups, since people don't just want to leech.\n\nIf you had instead just left the downloading to lidarr, people could've still just used Lidarr with the Tubifarry or similar plugin to download via slskd and then get the quality of music that they set up in the quality profiles.\n\nRight now, there's no control possible. Everything is automated, but with absolutely no transparency.\n\nI suggest you take care of the open issues that have been left completely unanswered before you keep promoting your app over and over.",

But i would love this as a backend for navidome or any other streamer, since they are all already very good and incorporate with many other services. Yours is nice, but too “standalone” IMHO…\n\nWhat holds me off are 200k tracks which would need to be analysed. Did this in the past, costs a lot of compute energy and power. And with all the tools, different implementations I could do this every other week which is more than annoying since very breaking change often includes a complete reanalyse of your base.\n\nEdit: u/schaka  not totally correct, you can just use your existing lidarr instance for downloading and leave soulseek disabled",

Hyper backup copies all docker containers and data across the network to the second nas located in a separate building, as well as uploading it to the cloud once a day.\n\nYes, Synology container manager to install Portainer, then Portainer to manage all containers from there. It is a much better interface for your containers. You can still see and modify them in container manager in the DSM if need be.\n\nThe Beelink is for Plex.  While I aim for zero transcoding of content some users have hardware that requires it. The NAS is already busy running all the containers and managing / storing all the data. Having a powerful mini computer for Plex ensures smooth transcodes and less strain on the NAS. I sometimes have 8 - 10 simultaneous streams, with 3 or 4 being transcoded. No sweat for the Beelink, but that would bing the NAS to its knees.\n\nThe Beelink is a headless Ubuntu server. It too is running everything in docker containers managed by Portainer.\n\nAs for container distribution, most everything runs on the main NAS. To balance processor power and memory usage some containers run on the other two servers. My Azuracast radio stations are served from the Backup NAS saving the main system's processor power for other tasks. Plex got its own system.",

They'll often run deals, and you should pay attention to which one may be the best for you, because unlike P2P, everything is hosted on the architecture of the provider you're purchasing.\n\nThen you have to pay to get into a indexer. There are indexers who you can be invited into (E.g: DrunkenSlug) but that requires either camping /r/UsenetInvites or knowing someone. The majority will be pay-to-play, and you can get a life-time subscription for cheap enough (~$60 USD.)\n\nIf you go through all of that, and you're familiar with self-hosting, it should be easy enough to setup Sabnzb and integrate it into your *arr stack. Trash-Guides would be your best bet for assistance if necessary.\n\nThe benefit of usenet is easy, exceptionally fast access to high-quality content (most of the time.) The downside is that it requires you to pay at minimum for your provider. It also eliminates the necessity to host files, so you can easily clean your media out after watching.\n\nThe downside is similar to that of trackers, just because you pay for an indexer (private tracker equivalent) doesn't mean that it will have indexed the media you're looking for. From what I've gathered, it's not uncommon to have multiple usenet indexers, which also increases the cost.\n\nI personally had subscribed to 3 different indexers, Althub, Tabula-Rasa, and Nzbplanet. I download primarily new content, and Anime. Althub is by and large the largest provider for grabs, while Nzbplanet is half the amount of grabs as Althub.\n\nSo, really, you have to pick your poison if you're going to sail the seas. Do you want to pay-to-play and have easier access to content that is still exceptionally cheaper than a streaming subscription? Or do you want to grind your way through the private tracker scene and host your media for others?\n\nEdit: I'll also point out that because the retention of Usenet is ~6300 days (I believe,) you'll basically always have access to *some* form of content, especially obscure. Again, this depends on the indexer and whether they've got it, but generally speaking, it's out there on usenet somewhere.",

I've even branched out a bit to host a Discord music bot for my squad discord server. learning a lot!\n\n  \nMy newest challenge is using Lidarr with Soulseek and another type of script called Soularr to automatically update my aging MP3 library to new versions of my albums instead of doing it album by album.

However, usenet is going to be your best bet, **unless** you're able to get into a private tracker that supports your language.\n\nI'd recommend going to /r/usenet and asking around about what indexers may be best for content in your language, as not all indexers will provide the same content. Additionally, you're going to want to configure your Radarr and Sonarr to prioritize your language, or at the very least install Bazarr to grab subs for your language.",

Seriously. So, I decided to build my own \"local internet.\" Big **Hypnospace Outlaw** vibes here. It’s not just for aesthetics; I needed a way to browse my media, read RSS feeds (via the Outlook Express UI), and access cached content without waiting for buffering.\n2. **The \"Vibe Coding\" Part:** I picked the flair for a reason. I'm a **System Engineer**, not a Frontend Developer. Coding isn't my main job. Yes, I used AI tools to bridge the gap. But this wasn't a magic \"one-shot prompt.\" I had to architect the backend, figure out the file system logic, and spend hours debugging spaghetti code. It was a grind.\n3. **Is it real?:** 100%. The screenshots aren't AI art. It connects to my real services (Navidrome, etc.) and actually works as my daily driver.\n4. **Source Code:** Right now, the code lives in my local Gitea. To be honest, it's a mess. I need to do some serious cleaning before I'm brave enough to push it to GitHub.\n\n*P.S. English isn't my first language, so bear with me.*",

The second most voted feature, multiplayer SSH sessions, aka. live SSH session sharing, only got 20% of votes.\n\nSome people mostly manage containers with the CLI and may appreciate Termix offering shortcuts.

Running most of the same stuff, though I'm on Unraid. \n\nI just bought a home, and am getting ready to deploy cameras and a local AI server to act as my HA voice assistant. I am also degoogling myself as best I can for the coming SaaS/Subscriptionpocolypse. I have about 20 remote Plex users, and am also putting up a couple small business websites. I'm planning on moving the Unraid media server to a collocation site to get cooling, power and speed taken care of. \n\nBut your infrastructure looks much more purposefully-built than mine is. Can you give me a play by play of how and why you laid things out like you did?  I'm not a sysadmin with any training, so this is a learning experience for me. I've just been learning as I go and spending money when it seemed right to do so.\n\nI noticed you're using both Suricata and ZenArmor. Can you talk a bit how they're set up and what they're doing for you? I only know what a quick web search says, but you might have a specific take more applicable to my setup.\n\nAre you collocating your server off site? If so, how's the performance when running HomeAssistant over distance? Are there any latency issues? I saw the Coral TPU and Frigate, which I plan on running as well.  Along with Whisper and Piper.  My plan is to collocate the Unraid server and then have a secondary AI server running at home with the cameras and detection software and integrating it all into HA.\n\nDo you plan on continuing with Google SSO in the future? Any security concerns about that?\n\nYou're running several dockers that I don't personally run, which is leading me to start doing some research on them. You've definitely got me curious. I really appreciate you putting up your chart.",

That said, the hosting site is only about 10 miles from my house, has very redundant high-speed connectivity, and I have FTTP at home, so that definitely helps.\n\nFor cameras and Al, from what I’ve seen recently Google Coral is no longer the recommended option. the Hailo-8 accelerator seems to be preferred.\n\nOn the security side, Suricata is running in IPS mode and focuses on filtering WAN traffic. ZenArmor runs on internal subnets and is used for outbound traffic filtering that's why they laid out on 2 sides of FW.\n\nfor  Google SSO I haven’t seen any security issues with it. I get notifications whenever someone attempts to create an account, the account would be created, but it has absolutely no permissions by default. I also get notification and can act instantly, it's very convenient for not tech users that use my infrastructure.",

Does it support the function to share my current trip? I found this particularly useful, if I am travelling to my parents' place they can see where I am, the speed of which I am travelling etc., so they know I am OK and when to expect me to arrive.\n3. Does it support setting a redis prefix? Because the only real way to enforce ACL in redis is via a prefix, you cannot stop any app from simply switching database and seeing all the keys for other apps. Some people simply use different redis instances, but I like consolidation.",

It saves the points also when there is no connection and then sends them when you are back. Sometimes this misses some data, did not find out why. \n\nGPSLogger seems to be working better in handling moments where I am not able to connect to the lab. This handled a 3 weeks visit to Spain just fine and then uploaded everything when I was back.

I’ve launched multiple apps on the play store during the covid period, back when we had no access to LLMs at all. Today AI simply let us to do more and focus on what actually matters, the business logic and hard problems.\n\nEven in this project, I’ve spent a significant amount of time building a stable note sync system while dealing with a local database. That’s not something you can solve with some prompts, there’s a lot of handwritten code, testing, and iteration went into this. And I’m still not fully satisfied, I’m sure there are edge cases I haven’t discovered yet. Debugging and making things reliable is always the hardest part, regardless of having access to the latest AI tools.\n\nThe reality is that developers have been using AI assisted tools since the early github copilot days, long before even cursor was a thing. Unfortunately, many non engineers see “AI” and immediately assume everything is vibe coded, without understanding what it actually takes to build and maintain a complete application.\n\nThat said, my advice to you is the same, if you believe you have built something good that can help others, you should share it. There will always be people who appreciate the hard work, even if some never try to understand it.\n\nThanks again for the encouragement, and I hope you do release your project when you’re ready.",

First of all, termix is a gateway, meaning that if you use the desktop / mobile app, your connections won't go straight to the server but instead over your hosted termix gateway instance. XPipe is purely client-based, meaning that it connects straight the servers from your desktop. The gateway approach has limitations, e.g. you can't just use any hardware security keys for SSH with it or communicate with your local password manager. With XPipe, that is possible.\n\nSecond, termix kinda goes for an all-in-one approach (it kind of has to), meaning that terminals, editor, file browser, SSH library, etc. is all built into termix via some javascript libraries. XPipe instead goes for integrations with external tools, meaning that you can use your own terminal, editor, etc. with it as it does not implement it on its own.

Anyway, the fact that Termix requires a gateway is what makes it stay farther away from Termius than XPipe. If my server where Termix is hosted is down, I can't use it. This isn't true for both Termius and XPipe. I like the local approach for this specifically because I don't depend on any other infrastructure.",

One thing I wanted was the ability to use MacOS touch id to authenticate into a remote shell, instead of username/password, or traditional private public key. It's a termius feature I really like. It sounds like that will not be possible with termix?\n\nI will also say, it sounds like a possible advantage of termix over xpipe's method is that if termix clients all depend on it's own termix server as a gateway, and xpipe is directly calling ssh ips, being able to ssh through multiple remote clients might be a simplier set up. Just create some sort of access (tailscale, vpn, etc) to the gateway server, which should allow you to have access to all the different machines on the remote network you've already set up?\n\nI will have to try to both to see the differences. My free github student pack of termius just ran out, and I've been searching for an open source alternative.",

I’m using since the beginning of the project. \n\n\\- \\[dpaste\\](https://github.com/DarrenOfficial/dpaste) - Why this not very know solution instead of the classic “pastebin” ones? Simple: this has the ability to returns urls with only 4 or 5 characters after the slash (example: dpaste.example.com/aBcDe). This is great because when I need to share something between devices, it’s very easy to remember the link. If I had the possibility of share a very long url, only because it’s very long, I would send the content of the paste instead the paste link. \n\n\\- \\[Forgejo\\](https://forgejo.org) (and their runners)- Great git server forked from Gitea with something extraordinary: the paths and the workflows syntax are the same as GitHub. Very easy to learn, maintain and improve. \n\nAnd of course nginx Proxy Manager and PiHole. \n\nWhat are yours “essentials”?",

      "text": "Hello folks, it's been a month since I last posted about an update. This update for BentoPDF is the biggest so far and introduces a lot of features.\n\nBut before that I wanted to share BentoPDF wrapped, which shows what tools and what type of PDFs you guys mostly used this year ❤️:  [BentoPDF Wrapped](https://www.bentopdf.com/wrapped.html) \n\n**New Releases**\n\n**1. Revamped Compression tool**\n\nBentoPDF now has the best compression among all open source tools.\n\nBentoPDF had two compression algos: Vector and Photon. Vector has been deprecated and replaced with Condense, which is now the recommended method.\n\nI tested it across various type of PDFs with different languages, and it performs either almost on par and sometimes better than commercial ones.\n\n**2. Office to PDF and PDF to Office Support**  \n  \nNow supports converting **Word, PowerPoint, Excel, CSV** documents to PDF.  \n  \nAdded support for OpenOffice formats: **ODT, ODS, ODP, and ODG**  \n  \nAlso supports for: **PDF to Word, PDF to Excel and PDF to CSV**\n\n**3. Now supports a variety of image formats**\n\nJPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, PNM, PGM, PBM, PPM, PAM, JXR, JPX, JP2 (JPEG 2000) PSD, SVG, HEIC, and WebP can now be converted to PDF\n\nAlso supports PDF to SVG\n\n**4. Markdown Support**\n\n  \nA new markdown live preview has been added, which supports both GFM and Common Mark. Mermaid support was also supposed to be in this release, but I stashed the changes and forgot to include them lol. But it will be included in next release.  \n\n\nPDF to Markdown is also supported with embedded image\n\n  \n5. **E-book & Comic Book Formats**  \n  \nAdded support for converting **EPUB, MOBI, CBR, CBZ, FB2, and XPS** files to PDF.\n\n  \n**6. Data Extraction & AI Ready**  \n  \n**Prepare for AI**: Output LLM-ready JSON from your PDF for easy ingestion by AI models.  \n  \n**Extract Tables**: Extract tables from PDF and export them as JSON, Markdown, or CSV.  \n  \n**PDF to Text**: This performs fast text extraction for digital PDFs. FOr non digital OCR tool is recommended.  \n  \n**Extract Images**: Extracts all images while retaining their original native format and resolution.\n\n**7. PDF/A SUpport**  \nSupports PDF/A-1b,2b,3b. Please verify with verapdf always.\n\n  \nMiscellaneous Tools\n\n\\---\n\nText to PDF now has proper support for RTL languages\n\nWe also added Booklet support\n\nRasteize PDF is now supported\n\nNested OCG support is included\n\n  \nThank you again for your support! In the next release Digital Signature and true text editing will be possible.\n\nFull Release Note: [https://github.com/alam00000/bentopdf/releases/tag/v1.15.1](https://github.com/alam00000/bentopdf/releases/tag/v1.15.1)",

I hope you get what I mean. This has been going on since inception and it’s pretty bad to look at if I may, although it’s just an aesthetic thing.

I took advantage of inotify to watch the labels directory, then used MQTT to publish the image to my HA server.  ~~I use NodeRed to then save the image from MQTT to a directory that then gets moved to a folder in my HA directory (NOT www as that's not secure), and then created a local camera entity.~~  EDIT: See below.  Automation uses the camera entity path/api to create the label.\n\nReason for the workaround being I didn't want to deal with network mounts/shares.  Not sure my way is \"better\" but it felt a bit cleaner to me.\n\nEdit: Had a further inspiration to streamline things, now just using an MQTT camera entity so no more need for the second script to copy things around on the second server.\n\nEdit 2: Blog post: [https://blog.fuzzymistborn.com/homebox-labels-over-mqtt/](https://blog.fuzzymistborn.com/homebox-labels-over-mqtt/)",

Because, coming up with POC products has been mad cheap and easy and anyone can knock up one-off hack of a project on their own. \n\nThe true mark of quality is therefore products that can show that they are being maintained and polished and actually solve some real world problems for real users out there.\n\nAs of now though, the massive majority of AI slop out there is just that.

I am not a developer, so I don't have the ability to check this but also I am not walking around with my eyes firmly closed to reality - a vibed project (right now) is not comparable in quality to human-coded project. Let's be realistic.\n\nIf I wanted to promote it publicly or charge for something then I would want to contract to real humans to review, change or even totally rewrite the project. Which means vibing is just prototyping an MVP/\n\nMy final point is that vibing allows the endless ideas in my head to become a reality. It allows me to improve processes in my life, in ways that suit only me. It's really a personal tool. I could learn to program, but that's a deep rabbit hole - I already have a career in technology and as you might already know this means I am constantly reskilling, upskilling or cross-skilling. It's a really great feeling to be able to turn my dreams into reality, importantly, a reality just for me.\n\nVibing isn't going away, and I can see a future where it integrates with a lot of people's daily lives. A future where static applications are going away, while an AI would be able to dynamically create an application that serves your purpose in that moment, in faster than real-time.

It doesn't strike me right to blame a few individuals who use these tools, nor I think it is a reliable way to improve the status quo.\n\nIn any case, I understand the bad things about AI usage, but my takeaways seem to be a bit different from the ones most people take from this situation: 1- We should absolutely think about the issues and concerns people raise about large scale usage of ML models, and keep them in mind as we develop the technology not only to improve it, but to mitigate it's problems (be them ethical or technical): and 2- We should not blame individual usage of technologies, and instead focus on the bigger aggressors, by promoting structural changes that try to fix the fundamental problems with our technology stack (e.g.: promoting clean energy, like nuclear or wind; mitigate ineffective usage of these technologies by big players; improve the conditions of living of those working on the entire line of production of the hardware we use).",

Sometimes it’s even better than what a solo developer would write manually.\n\nFrom my own person experience, I have not found this to be true for purely vibe-coded software. \n\nSome weeks ago, someone posted a \"production ready encrypted\" notes app, that was in fact *not* encrypting notes.  That's very problematic, and I think this subreddit has done a great job filtering out those horrible applications.\n\n> That assumption held because building software was hard.\n> The difficulty was a filter.\n\nI disagree with this premise. From my view, if the generally held assumption was that building software was hard, the open-source community would *not* have been as vibrant as it was before LLMs became generally available, software development was becoming very approachable and easier to learn.\n\nThe filter for me, was whether the software at least did the thing it was said to do, and the developer was open to fixing issues. The article equates this to \"time\", but its more than that, especially with this subreddit. There are  relationships built with those that build and distribute software (vibe-coded or not). If people have a bad relationship with the developer, vibe-coded or not, no one would use their software.\n\n> More importantly, everyone can code above their skill level. \n\nMany people did that WAY before LLMs came around. Copying and pasting code found on different forums, and StackOverFlow. \n\nDeep domain knowledge is **always** a continual problem in any field as technology evolves. I remember in the early 2000s people complaining that Python was giving people the ability to develop apps faster, but without an understanding of the science behind computing.

You then ask a question like \"write me a python function to transpose a matrix\". An LLM will then analyse the question, find python code someone wrote (a GH repo, a blog about transposing matrices, etc.) and regurgitate that code to you, maybe altering it a bit (e.g. to put in your variable names).\n\nIf the coding subject is a common one, an LLM will give you very good results: we've had people code MVP chess/checkers/memory games in a couple of hours - but there is plenty of code out there implementing those things for an LLM to draw from. If you tackle more complex problems, or problems with subtly different requirements than what's available online, an LLM will struggle, and you along with it (I've been there).\n\nThere's another aspect to consider here: as a geek developer, I am *more expressive* writing code than writing natural language. If I have a conceptual solution to a problem, I'll generally need less time to convert that into code than to write out the solution in natural language, guiding an LLM in \"coding\".\n\nLLMs currently don't even understand context around texts they parse - I've had Claude and Gemini suggest \"solutions\" that were actually feature request discussions around possible additions/changes to tools/languages.\n\nLLMs are trained to parse natural language queries and return grammatically correct replies. That's it. Factual correctness is a side-effect of training materials and their correctness. As a trivial example, if you trained an LLM on texts that said the Sun is green, that LLM would give a grammatically perfectly correct reply to your query about the colour of the Sun, and it would be something like \"The Sun is green.\"",

They work on predicting. \n\nWhen trained the model compresses statistical patterns of a stupid quantity of code into math weights and when asked they predict (token by bloody token) what the most likely sequence of characters is, based on whatever pattern they learned.\n\nThis means the result can be a Frankenstein of code that has never existed before, and at times this CAN solve extremely complex problems in ways a developer hadn't thought of, hence why it can feel like magic.\n​\nBtw this is a double edge sword as it's also why they hallucinate libraries that don't exist at times \n\nHope I didn't come across too pedantic, facts are important especially on controversial topics like this one",

I just publicly released a vibe coded app I made primarily for myself but then decided to publish it under open source, since I found it might be useful for others.\n\nSo my stand is: Vibe coded apps are not bad by default. They are only as bad/god as the Dev who prompted and reviewed them. AI does mistakes, but so do humans. An AI can help you to increase the security, when you ask it to. Same as China can produce high end products if you ask and pay for them. \n\nSo when I come across an app, I first check **who has published it**. Is it a first grade student or someone with a Github history and repositories dating back to 2009. Still no guarantee it has no flaws. So reviewing them is the same effort as on human coded projects.\n\nBut I see a much bigger issue with vibe coded projects: It is the maintenance. I call it the Tinder effect. If someone used 5 prompts to build it, he might be not so attached to the project and abandon it early for the next vibe coded project. So you should probably not build your entire business around it. But there are so many \"nice to have\" projects.\n\nAn absolute NoGo for me are closed source vibe apps.

          "text": "I'm kinda tired of the binary \"vibe-coded vs not vibe-coded\" labeling, and I agree with what a few other comments here already pointed out: we should separate \"vibe-coding\" from just LLM-assisted coding. In my head, \"vibe-coded\" specifically means \"someone with little/no programming context is delegating basically everything to an LLM and shipping whatever comes out.\" That's different from LLM-assisted coding. And there's clearly a spectrum: you can vibe-code a throwaway script, or use an LLM as a fancy autocomplete + rubber duck while still doing real engineering.\n\nWhat actually matters (regardless of the label) is the *code quality*: the right patterns/strategies are used (and not cargo-culted), the code is maintainable/readable, it's actually extensible without turning into spaghetti, etc. Humans ship catastrophic slop here all the time too. \"Written by a human\" isn't a quality guarantee any more than \"made in China\" is.\n\nFrom here on this is kind of a tangent, and it got way longer than I intended. So feel free to skip it. But I already wrote it, so I'm dropping it here anyway.\n\nComing from an ML research and as a systems engineer background, I was already using LLMs in my workflow before ChatGPT blew up, so I've seen both where they're genuinely powerful and where they confidently drive straight off a cliff. Used correctly, LLMs are incredibly useful *tools* (including for coding) and can sometimes save you time, but the annoying part is you don't get to skip the fundamentals: you still need programming knowledge *and* a feel for how LLMs behave to constrain them and validate outputs.\n\nIn those cases you can vibe-code and it's usually a reasonable tradeoff: one-off scripts, personal small-scale apps, \"I need a tiny app to solve this niche problem and I don't care about long-term maintenance.\" LLMs are good at getting you to \"good enough\" fast there. And yeah, it can still fail, but the nice thing is the blast radius is small - if it goes sideways you can just throw it away and restart from scratch in 10 minutes.\n\nWhere people get burned is bigger systems. Once you're building something that needs to grow over time, the hard part isn't typing code - it's the design part: architecture, boundaries, interfaces, dependencies, etc. Current (and perhaps even future) LLMs are very good at producing something that looks plausible, but they don't reliably \"think\" their way through open-ended design spaces. They work best when the answer space is narrow / well-established. When there are tons of valid options and tradeoffs depend on context, so if you just ask \"design this whole app using best practices\" you're basically forcing the model to pick from a huge space of possibilities without enough constraints. It'll still give you *something*, but unless you already have the context to judge it, you won't know if it's appropriate - because it didn't \"think through\" the tradeoffs and pick a design so much as *sample one* from a huge space of plausible options (more like rolling dice).\n\nIn bigger projects, I've found LLMs can be genuinely useful if you stop treating them like \"the engineer\" and instead use them more like an implementation engine. That means you (a human) do the architecture and decision-making up front: split the system into well-isolated components with clear responsibilities and stable interfaces, keep modules independent and understandable without needing the whole repo in your head (and in the model context (!)), and make everything explicit and boring rather than clever. Verbosity isn't a drawback here - LLMs will type for you. Once the boundaries are real, you can hand the model a narrowly scoped task without having LLMs fail and ruin the entire repo, and without having to include the large context of an entire repo. And once your modules are actually separated, you can add tests. Tests are the thing that turns LLM output from \"a vibe\" into something measurable. With good tests, the model cannot be ambiguous about correctness. It either passes or it doesn't. Same with documentation. All the design decisions, policies, etc. should be written down. Not just for humans, but because that becomes the context you want to feed an LLM. Strong specs + tests massively narrow the problem space, and that's where LLMs tend to perform best: filling in deterministic implementation details inside a clearly defined box. At that point it should be obvious that \"context\" shouldn't mean \"here's my entire repo, now act like a senior dev.\" It should mean \"here's the spec, here are policies, here are the tests ...\" Because LLMs can stare at your codebase all day and still not reliably infer the *system's intent* from it.\n\nAlso, none of this is some brand new AI-native idea - it's basically classic systems/software engineering. Getting value out of them at scale still requires real engineering skill. And the \"narrow the option space\" prompt-writing is hard without domain/context knowledge. This applies outside programming too.\n\nAnyway, you can do good development while using LLMs, and you can also do terrible development without them. That's why I don't like labeling anything that touches an LLM as automatically \"vibe-coded.\" That said, building a good large-scale application *purely* by vibe-coding is not possible with current LLMs (and probably won't be for a long time). And honestly, most \"LLM-driven\" projects I see today are slop.\n\n(Also yes, this comment is LLM-assisted lol, my English isn't native)",

The inner net is the devices I trust (PCs, Phones, Servers), the outer net is IoT. Inner can reach outer but not vice versa (it's not even subnets or vlans, it's just two routers for two different networks). I am not saying this is the greatest, but it is simple enough for me.\n\n> How would you set up everything behind a VPN? \n\nIn the past I had lots of open ports for services, all very complicated.\n\nToday I see basically three options:\n1. A cloud VM running a VPN server, devices connect to it and maybe your home entirely through a gateway. This way you don't need any open ports.\n2. A local machine runs a VPN server. This is the easiest setup. Roaming machines just connect to the VPN and can talk to your home machines.\n3. Tailscale or alternatives, maybe with selfhosted server, but I don't particularly like that option because it involves non-free software and self-hosting seems more complex than a VPN server.\n\n> Should even access to the internet be via VPN? \n\nI would say it depends on your trust level of your ISP and your country's juristiction. One or the other company will always know the IP addresses you connect to. You just have to chose whether to trust your ISP or your VPN provider.",

Also NAS should do just NAS, HAOS should do just home automation stuff, and everything else can run in a single VM with Docker and GPU access. For the DNS server I would set it up such that DNS doesn't break if PiHole is down.

The simplest solution is going to be something like unRAID and Plex (it’s more widely available, easier for non-technical friends and family, and if you want more stats taltulli is good). JellyFin is solid and less connected to an evermore enshitified company, but your going to have to deal with giving more support to users…\n\nMac mini… sure. I assume you’ve got iCloud but want a local storage solution. That’ll do the job. Pi-hole on this is doable but better to put it on your server.\n\nVPN is based on need. Media stuff behind one, remote access on another. Cloud flare tunnels will work for anything that needs to be public. You mention Unify, so you’ll have Teleport which works well. Tailscale is good too. Consider that whatever you pick, you’re IT for whoever you let in… choose wisely. \n\nHome Assistant really does all the things. But you want to use the OS version, not docker. This is another good reason to have a more fleshed out server like unRAID, so you can run VMs.\n\nDump google tv and android? I dunno, having one ecosystem will simplify things, and I trust google about as far as I can throw them… I guess at least it’s not FireTV…",

An example is if you don't configure payments, they won't work and all users will be under the \"Pro\" plan automatically, and that section won't even appear in the webapp.\n\nAI is an exceedingly good semantic searching system, so since I built the project slowly over the week this was an easier way to figure out which environment variables became necessary and which are not.

Next benefit of signal for me is that it leaves more of a history in the notifications that I wasn't getting in HA notifications. Once you swiped them, unless you stored them in persistent notifications they were gone. The next is I use signal groups, so if I want to add/remove someone from a notification group, I can do it quickly without changing the automation or group in HA. And its all encrypted so safer to send stuff that you wouldn't want people to ever really have access to.",

In the end I found a script that would just run and install it all for me but I got in a huge mess and most of Nextcloud was broken.\n\nEventually I just paid someone on fiverr to help me out and he did a great job of it. I've learnt a lot since then but even now I look through the config files for nginx and nextcloud he created and still don't understand half of it.\n\nYou say just 'spin up a PHP container' and 'slap nginx in front of it'.

That said, there are multiple ways to deploy Nextcloud, and depending on how it’s set up, the experience can vary quite a bit.\nPersonally, I run Nextcloud using the Nextcloud AIO container, which comes pre-packaged with everything you need, including Nextcloud Talk and Nextcloud Office. It makes deployment straightforward and, somewhat surprisingly, uses very little in the way of system resources.\nAs an example, my users have uploaded around 3 TB of data over the past three years. The data is backed up daily and stored on mechanical drives, yet performance has been effortless and reliable. One key factor, in my experience, is running the Nextcloud application itself on an SSD. Media storage on HDDs works perfectly fine, as Nextcloud’s indexing is quite efficient and doesn’t require frequent disk access.",

I use the Synology reverse proxy to access the containers on my server remotely, and it works great. So I understand the challenges of self hosting, including Nextcloud, and for what you’re trying to do, Synology may be the better solution.

The Android phone app is good as well, so far I've got no complaints, but I've been using it only a week.\n\nFor photo sync - immich.",

I wonder if people who write such things are actually into selfhosting and work in IT or if they just want a instantly perfect working out of the box solution without doing any configuration?\nI personally run Nextcloud for many years now and I only had temporary minor issue with a few third party apps so far that have been fixed quickly. I even run a Nextcloud instance at work with 300+ Users and OnlyOffice and it works perfectly fine and is responsive. Sure, you need to check the manual for tweaking configuration and setting things up properly but there are no hidden secrets on how to do it and it doesn't take you days to do so. And anyone whoe does selfhosting should check the manuals and documentation anyways.",

However, there was a minor thing a while back, couldn't tell you what it was, but it took me for-goddamn-ever to figure out how to get back into the back-end of the AIO. Along with wanting to consolidate and make the environment smaller, I started looking at OCIS and opencloud. Both are also stupid to set up if you have an existing proxy configuration. They also dont have any sort of built in MFA out of the box. That was a deal breaker for me on both. Everyone speaks so well of syncthing, so I gave it another try. And damn it is impressive. Just set it up as a container on my truenas box, and it's all right there.

Funny one of my friends is still using one of the older versions with manual installation, quite robust so to say. Community edition, never failed btw! \n\nThen I moved to NextCloud with a belief that it is going to perform better, may have better features or whatever. docker-based setup with TLS + S3 as the storage. In general, worked fine. But then I wanted to expand and run the Office tools and that automatically would've increased the cost of the EC2 instance. Went with bare-metal server instead and after various hoops with AIO appliance I've dropped the ball - self-signed certificate is pure pain and some other issues. \n\nSo you know what? This year I went back to Seafile myself. Setup == Seafile + OnlyOffice + Cloudflare Proxy(not the reverse tunnel!), all docker. Works perfectly, never gave me any headache, handles stuff. Works faster, their filesystem might be something to be afraid of, but proper daily backups should save you from having whoopsies.",

I tried for several days, hit a handful of dead ends, then started over (because someone on this sub said \"it didn't work for me the first time, then I started over and it worked\"), and well, it did work. I wasn't keen on exposing it on a domain at first, but I already had a domain sitting there, so I used a third-level from it and now I can access my calendar from anywhere. \n\nAdmittedly, I use it for several \"lighter\" features it has: it has replaced Google Calendar, it is synching my phone's address book, and I only share a limited set of files on it - even though some extensions, from GPXPod to Cookbook, have opened up use cases I hadn't been expecting for NextCloud in particular. For instance I never thought I'd end up using a password manager, but now that I can host one myself I'm seriously considering it. \n\nWas it easy? No way! The AIO installer lets you put it in the network you have with the services you have and doesn't expect to enforce any convention or any tool on you - the flip side is that you have to do all that stuff by yourself and it's not always clear how you couple yours with theirs. I can handle setting up Docker containers, configuring a DNS server, the router of the ISP modem, I can set up a reverse proxy with Nginx, I'm a pro and I'm passionate about it - yet it wasn't exactly easy as I expected an AIO installation to be. I totally agree that this setup is not for the casual hobbyist. \n\nCould it be easier than this? Maybe reducing the versatility could help in streamlining the process. Maybe removing some features that require additional setup steps would help too. I agree that the problem NC solves is definitely complex and requires more work, but there's definitely room for improvement. As usual, it's a trade-off, and sometimes it's not trivial to realise what the two opposites of it are.",

It automatically scans your compose files for newer image versions and does a PR into your github repo with the version change and release notes if available. Only thing is you gotta switch from :latest to your specific current version so it can tell there's a new one out but that's not bad. I use komodo to redeploy when I merge the pull request, I think portainer can do the same\n\nEdit to add: it's still not set and forget, you need to pay attention to the release notes and versions before committing so you don't break something else as any upgrade. For example, it wanted to upgrade my immich postgres from 16 to 18 and it REALLY didn't like that - thankfully rolling it back to 16 took care of it and got me going again. I'm sure there's a filter or something I can configure but for now just rejecting the PR is good enough for me",

Since it's a full blown enterprise setup, I felt it's a bit resource heavy (900Mb RAM, 3 containers). I only have 2 users and the login page load time was (felt) longer. PocketID is passkey based (no passwords and OTP) and setup felt easy. Also for Authentik upgrades, downloading a new docker compose everytime felt tedious. I recently nuked my setup and started from scratch so just took the leap and I am satisfied with PocketID.\n\nFor Vaultwarden vs Bitwarden, it was nothing but personal preferences. I setup Vaultwarden and closed my Bitwarden account (the cloud one) and within a week Bitwarden came out with the Lite deployment. I moved back to Bitwarden Lite and paid for the subscription to use all features (I don't mind paying since it's a great product). Sure the storage and RAM footprint looks to be larger for Bitwarden compared to Vaultwarden, but again it's just personal preference.",

My feeling is that any release that doesn't have something seriously wrong with it (a negative tagged CF) should be grabbed if there are no better options. Trash Guides has the same philosophy I do... just grab anything that isn't explicitly bad if there are no perfect options.\n\nBut then Trash Guides has its own quirks I don't like, such as only grabbing 4K if you choose that quality profile. If the movie hasn't been released in 4K, just grab 1080p in the meantime and upgrade to 4K when possible. By fully separating them, you're basically forcing me to check if a movie even has a 4K release. Profilarr's defaults agree with me on this one.\n\nBasically I want my quality profiles to always grab *something* no matter if it's not an ideal resolution, size, release group, etc.",

I took a look at the viewing statistics. In the past year, it had streamed 75 hours of tv shows, and 8 hours of movies. That’s not exactly high usage, or even medium usage, it’s sporadic at best, and it’s not enough to warrant keeping a server running 24/7.\n\nI’ve used the same approach to everything else I self hosted, and I’ve gone from self hosting everything to simply either shutting it down (if unused) or putting it in the cloud.",

Yes, there is a noticeable delay when starting a new show, but it’s only a few seconds, and once playing there isn’t a delay skipping around in the media.\n\nIt of course depends on your bandwidth, but then again, so does Plex.\n\nThat’s how it’s rolling for now. Depending on the world situation in a couple of months, Plex or Emby may make its way back if the EU and US starts fighting over Greenland, and the EU pulls all the levers of putting tariffs on US tech services, or outright ban them.",

      "text": "In a couple of months, Karakeep will be two years old. 2025 has been a wild year, so that's a quick lookback about what happened in 2025, and while you're here, I can tell you about the 0.30 release.\n\n*EDIT: For those who don't know what* [*karakeep*](https://karakeep.app/) *is, it's a bookmark manager that's designed for easy sharing and fast retrieval with opt-in AI tagging and summarization.*\n\nLet's start by some stats:\n\n* Karakeep started the year with \\~10k stars on Github, we're now at 22k stars!\n* We had 8 major releases in 2025 starting from 0.21 (the 10k stars release), and ending with 0.29. We had 819 commits in 2025.\n* I have no idea how many active installations there are for karakeep, but apple and google give me some stats about the mobile apps usage, and we're at \\~7.5k monthly active users (MAU) on the mobile apps. On the extensions side, google suggests that we have 29k weekly active users (wth!) and firefox says we have 2.5k daily active users.\n* We're ending the year with 159 contributors on Github (can't be thankful enough) and \\~800 members in our discord server.\n* 1 name change, £8k in lawyer fees and a successful trademark registration.\n\nThe year had a crazy start, we had our moment of fame on the frontpage of hackernews, followed by the now-infamous hoarder saga. After a couple of months of trademark nonsense, we ended up changing the app's name to Karakeep. Back then, I was afraid that the name change would kill the momentum, but I was wrong and Karakeep ended up more famous than Hoarder ever was. As of two days ago, we're now the proud owners of the \"Karakeep\" trademark to hopefully deter future trolls.\n\nAnother big event this year, was the launch of Karakeep cloud. Trying to fill the gap that pocket left, share the product with non-techies, and go through the full productionization journey of the product which was quite interesting.\n\nKarakeep was born out of this subreddit, got popular because of it, and it's what's keeping me going. (confession: I read every mention of karakeep in this sub). It honestly warms my heart every time I see karakeep being recommended here. Thank you, happy new year and looking forward to a strong 2026!\n\nWhile you're here, I've just released [v0.30](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep/releases/tag/v0.30.0), which includes:\n\n* Karakeep wrapped 2025 (a bit late).\n* PDF archives\n* Better metadata extraction for reddit, youtube and amazon. Reddit in particular used to be a common pain point which is hopefully now addressed.\n* Reader settings that are synced across all devices to better improve the read-it-later part of karakeep.\n* Customization of AI settings per user (toggling it on/off, changing the language and also the tagging style).\n* [Our docs](https://docs.karakeep.app/) got a big revamp in terms of styling, organization and also some new content. We now have a \"Using karakeep\" section that talks about the different concepts of karakeep.\n* The mobile app also got a bunch of UI/UX improvements.\n* And a lot more mentioned in the [release notes](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep/releases/tag/v0.30.0).\n\nFinally, I'm collecting testimonials for karakeep to put them on the homepage. If you’ve been using it and feel like sharing a few words, I’d appreciate it.",

      "text": "I signed up for their service and chose a ‘Full Year Commitment’ after hearing about them. To my despair, this was my worst decision. Although I had opted for their cheapest service, as soon as I tried connecting to something as basic as GITHUB, I got to know that I cannot do it cz I’ve been assigned a blacklisted IP. I develop for open source and cannot afford really expensive servers for all my use cases. This server was supposed to be for a cloud reverse proxy into my homelab!\n\nOn opening the incident # CS14530016 support told me to run a bunch of unneeded commands (wasting a day or two) only to later confirm that indeed my IP was blacklisted.\n\nUpon requesting them to well.. rotate it as any sane person would do, I got responded with the following response:\n\nWe regret to inform you that we cannot change the primary IP address of the server, since the primary IP is under blacklist we cannot change or replace it. If you want a different IP you will need to purchase a new server however we cannot guarantee a clean IP as our IPv4's are recycled as there is currently a shortage of IPv4's, all IPv4's are recycled from most service providers therefore there are times certain IP(s) would be placed in a block-list. We are unable to de-list IP(s) if they are in a block-list we do not support and IP(s) are unable to be replaced especially if it's the main IP of the server.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nLike really? Apart from their atrocious UI, is this somehow become an expected practice and / or outcome? I understand that their servers are cheap and clearly would’ve attracted abusers in the past but why am I, a paying customer penalised for it? Curious to know what you guys think on if expecting a clean IP is now a luxury which warrants additional premium?\n\nLooking for guidance from the community on their experience over this scenario and other alternatives.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nEDIT: This server is blacklisted under UCEPROTECTL3.\n\nIt’s a brand new server bought two weeks ago. Since then I’ve been in letter exchange with support. GitHub is only one such affected host.\n\nEDIT2: Some of you have suggested that being on the blacklist may not be the cause for my issues. Doing a traceroute although shows that the requests stop ‘hopping’ or ‘routing’ any further post reaching a Microsoft owned IP. curl resolves the IP but timeout and fails to perform the TLS Handshake. Also, it is possible that their support is delusional because what they said was the following:\n\n*I can see that your server IP {redacted} is blacklisted under UCEPROTECTL3 which is likely causing the issue. As OVH does not manage UCEPROTECT we will unfortunately not be able to delist the IP immediately and also we don't have the ETA.*\n\nAnd after verifying that indeed my IP is blacklisted therein, I just assumed that that’s the cause. Could there be something else cooking? Even Cloudflare doesn’t work. And, it’s not a general issue with HTTPS.\n\n—\n\ncurl -v   [ https://1.1.1.1 ](https://1.1.1.1)\n\n\\*   Trying 1.1.1.1:443...\n\n\\* connect to 1.1.1.1 port 443 from {redacted} port 35724 failed: Connection timed out\n\n\\* Failed to connect to 1.1.1.1 port 443 after 135972 ms: Could not connect to server\n\n\\* closing connection #0\n\ncurl: (28) Failed to connect to 1.1.1.1 port 443 after 135972 ms: Could not connect to server\n\nPlease note that a curl to Google on 443 works just fine and I’m able to receive the HTML payload back just fine.",

It's not that hard. You submit a delisting request (together with proof of resolution if required) to the blacklist providers on whose lists your IP is (there are tools to check that) and that'll get the IP off the lists. Hosting providers regularly do that and for most of them, it's an automated process these days. Most of them also inform their customers if an IP of theirs was reported as abusive and require them to fix potential issues.\n\nIf that wasn't the issue and if it was indeed just GitHub being weird, you'd of course be correct.",

The major release comes with a few breaking changes that might affect you, so please check out the [upgrade guide](https://pocket-id.org/docs/setup/major-releases/migrate-v2) before upgrading.\n\nThis release comes with a few new features, but in the spotlight are the two most requested features:\n\n\\- [SCIM Provisioning](https://pocket-id.org/docs/configuration/scim): The SCIM integration allows you to provision and de-provision users automatically. Unfortunately it's not supported by many services at the moment but I hope there will be more services that will support it in the future.\n\n\\- [Data Export and Import](https://pocket-id.org/docs/setup/data-export-import): Two new CLI commands have been added to import and export your Pocket ID data.  This is useful when creating backups, moving an installation to another instance or switching database providers.\n\n  \nYou can read the full release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/pocket-id/pocket-id/releases/tag/v2.0.0).\n\n  \nWe hope that you are enjoying Pocket ID :) As always, if you think there is a feature missing feel free to propose it on [GitHub](https://github.com/pocket-id/pocket-id/issues) or give your vote with a thumbs up (👍) on existing feature requests.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2b1wyb7vmzag1.png?width=3029&format=png&auto=webp&s=67bbc663c5eb92fd4133233ab0e1050796ab39fa\n\n",

Whenever I am working on something in the homelab, I end the session with telling Claude to make any necessary updates to my homelab documentation based on what was discussed or done. It writes the documentation updates to mark down files, makes a commit, and then creates a PR for me to review and merge if things look good. It's been working great so far and doubles as a means for Claude to have instant reference documentation on top of chat history to look back at.",

FPS multiplayer games which are the subscription / micro transaction cash cows of the industry just don't work well (network latency vs frame latency) especially not with all the high refresh +240hz screens coming out.\n\nA heavily optimized AAA game is *at least* ~60GB, probably more. Which means at least from the gaming context some form of local storage is going to be necessary, even if it isn't up in the double digit Terabyte range.\n\nFurthermore the main buyers of AI are big tech / cloud providers.\n\nThe energy costs of running said AI are not low, which means they'll try to cross-subsidize with other products in their stack. That will namely be \"serverless\" architecture and storage (Azure, AWS, GCP).\n\nSome of those offers are already pretty terrible with regards to ingress / egress fees, so increasing the price is only going to make it worse, which will justify some SMB's moving to self-hosting to reduce costs.\n\nAnd as long as SMB's have a need / can buy storage in bulk from manufacturers, consumers too will have a way to acquire them. Even if it is slightly worse then \"at cost\".\n\nIf true, it means we should experience a \"squeeze\" (on storage supply) as SMB's move out of the cloud, before it relaxes later.\n\nHowever that all assumes AI continues on a growth trajectory. More likely i think it's going to fail spectacularly.\n\nThis is also why prices of RAM are so high in part. The RAM cartel don't want to overinvest in more capacity only for AI to fail and have it just sitting there doing nothing. They'd rather constrain supply.",

So cloud fees will go up proportionately. \n\nAnd the last few years have been marked by a reversal of the cloud only trend, precisely because both cloud compute and cloud storage (egress fees!) have been climbing in costs. Add to  that rising concerns about data sovereignty and protection (US cloud act, debacles with hacks and downtime) and slowly companies are going back in house. \n\nBecause the cloud providers will pay similarily marked up prices for their hardware as a medium scale own premises installation would, the price ratio between the two should stay consistent so I don’t think current trends will reverse. \n\nAlso the private people that need TBs of storage are better served with local just because of the cloud prices. If you’re a data hoarder cloud always was unaffordable. Having a 30tb server is something else than getting 100gb Dropbox cloud storage.  The same things apply here as well. \n\nThe typical user basically needs a 2tb SSD for the os, documents, a few games and maybe local caching of streaming clients. Depending on your use case you can be set for life with 500gb. Cloud storage is not useful for any of these things (if you’re using more cloud storage than there is local one and you rely on as needed download of files, have a long hard think about who really has your data then and if that is a good choice)",

And for things like WhatsApp / Facebook / Instagram, the network effect makes self-hosting basically impossible for my family and friends.\n\nWhat’s yours?

That's not following the spec they created in the first place. We have signing keys and all kinds of protection that make this entirely unnecessary. It's existing IPs that get exploited (i.e. Salesforce now requires users to verify themselves before sending a single email). \n\n*Why are we letting these companies break and control the internet? Isn't that a sign you need to stop relying on them...?*\n\nSame time, you can spin up a domain and start sending verified emails from services without issue, so I'm not convinced this is not possible. It's difficult to setup, but not hard to lock down, setup DKIM, etc. There are guides, tools, it's not a black box.",

I don't mean all of your data but the data the apps have access to (e.g. what stops your document/photo manager from publicly exposing your documents/photos by uploading them to a file hosting service).\n\nI know you can cut off the apps' network access but that's not always possible since some/most need it and as far as I know IP address filtering per container is not easy to configure (+ whitelisting IPs would be a hassle as well). Also just because the apps are open source does not mean people have to notice a malicious code.\n\nSo how can you prevent something like this from happening?\n\nThanks!",

You can even paste the code into an LLM of your choice and ask it to explain it to you and check to make sure there are no security issues.

          "text": "For people saying \"look at the code\" (which is a very valid answer), how many of you have actually validated that the docker image was built from the code referenced?\n\nThere's a really seminal lecture by Ken Thompson called \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\" ([https://www.cs.cmu.edu/\\~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson\\_1984\\_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf)) which points out that you can read and verify every single line of code in a program, but you can still get a trojan if you haven't read and verified every single line of code in the \\*compiler\\*. Obviously, the recent NPM worms have made this suddenly not at all theoretical.\n\nBut we have to figure out how to trust stuff! We fall back on stuff like project age, GitHub stars, number of installs, number of releases, and general vibes. It's pretty unlikely that Jellyfin, for example, has been maliciously stealing peoples information all along. Someone might have noticed! But that still leaves the possibility of some of these supply chain attacks where someone else ends up with ownership of an open source repo and legitimately publishes a malicious release; unlikely to happen to Jellyfin but proof that an old repo isn't immune.\n\nThat's why AI slop is so insidious. Partially because it dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for malicious software. Pre-LLMs, it probably wasn't worth the effort to build a useful piece of software and embed malware in it; you could get as good or better results faster. But now you can jam out some half working slop that will fool people and get your attack out there. But also it makes the half working slop harder to detect as slop too!\n\n  \nEdit: To be clear, this isn't anti-Open Source. It's just an interesting reflection on how trust is complex and multi-faceted!",

Just look at libxz - that code base gets regularly interacted with by (at least) hundreds of people who are packaging it for various distros as core software and yet very few people were actually developing the code, and even if they were the backdoor was only spotted through shear luck by an engineer doing some performance testing who noticed a weird regression and dug into it, *no one* spotted it purely off the back of it being open source. \n\n\nI'm not saying that open source is bad either, I'm just saying that it shouldn't be treated as automatically trustworthy.

Even then, the risk will never be zero - as you note, bugs or malicious code can be overlooked.\n\nThere are restriction options like having sandboxes which only allow an app access to certain whitelisted internet resources (as you mention), and will quarantine any other access attempts for your approval (through an interface that the app itself can't interact with), but if an app says it needs access to app-manufacturer.com or hugeplatform.net in order to even function at all, it's going to come down to whether you trust that app (or any of its future updates) and that site to potentially have access to your data.\n\nAll I can suggest is that you don't allow apps direct access to the internet at all, and only access them (and your personal data) from within your own network or via encrypted VPN.",

But we run into an obvious problem and an old, but timeless, meme, \"ain't nobody got time for that.\" Unless it is your paid job to review open source code for malicious or vulnerable code, or you have a hobby to do so, I'm willing to bet that most people who can understand what they read still won't read it. Similar to the terms and conditions or EULA of products. Yes, we agree to all these objectionable and horrific terms when we subscribe to or buy something, but almost no one has read these terms after the first 3 or so times when they were a child.\n\nSo to this, what is the means of staying safe? It all comes down to the wisdom of the masses and old a project is. We trust that if there is a problem someone else has found and exposed it either by reading the source code or having experience the malicious effects. So if a project is a year or so old and has several thousand users, its probably legit if nothing has happened up to that point. It isn't a guarantee as anything and anyone can make something legit and then sneakily add sleeper code in without anyone noticing later on, or even find themselves compromised by a bad actor who uploads malicious code without them noticing.\n\nOverall it does come down to best practice. No one is going to legitimately read every line of code in every software they install. That is impractical unless it is your paid job. So follow best practice. Keep multiple backups of mission critical and irreplaceable information. Keep highly sensitive information airgapped from any possible internet connection where possible, and just remember risk is inherent in life, sometimes shit happens and you just gotta take a breath and cleanup the mess afterwards. If you have to take a weekend changing passwords because your password manager was compromised, or spend the afternoon canceling and freezing all your banks and cards, that is just a happenstance of living life. We can be the safest drivers of a motor vehicle, buy the most reliable vehicle, and still find ourselves out thousands in repair shop bills because nature and other idiots exist despite us doing everything \"right\".",

FOSS and all that.\n\nI work as a developer (mostly old codebases on SLA:s) during daytime so it was nice toying around with some (what I think is) modern stuff like Next.js and OpenCode. \n\nAt first I built it for myself but then I thought \"eh\", why not make it public, maybe someone will find it useful. \n\nIt’s a really bland UI, kinda lightweight (\\~70MB memory), but stable to use. Please be kind!\n\nTo comply with the rules: I am the maker of the app, it was built with the help of AI, and I have no gain in you pulling the image and running the container yourself  – except for maybe sleeping a little better at night knowing that it might have helped someone choose a good movie to watch.",

The episode will now not play at all, just giving me a spinning circle.\n\nI go into settings and toggle on \"Offline Mode\". The episode can now play fine without a data connection of any kind.\n\nI try and go back to my home tab to download something else, but now nothing will load at all until i turn off the 'Offline Mode', even with mobile data active.\n\nIt seems a bit counterintuitive to keep having to jump in and out of settings just to watch something that's sitting locally on the device. Can it not just play without having to do that? The 'Offline Mode' seems to be acting like a secondary switch for my mobile data connection, which is odd.",

Gripes, I know, just quality of life stuff. The app has improved so much since I started using it and it's been great overall!",

It's been a couple of intense weeks of work and testing!\n\nWe built qui to be a one-stop-shop for your torrents and their lifecycle, with the main goal that it should work great with huge qBittorrent instances. We have users running single instances with 70k+ torrents working great and others running 35+ instances in a single qui also working great. The multi instance support has been well received by our users!\n\nIt runs everywhere (Linux,MacOS,Windows) on all the common architectures like x86/arm/arm64 as native binaries or containers.\n\nSome of the highlights in this latest version include:\n\n* Automations: powerful workflows and orphan scanning (tqm/qbit\\_manage features)\n* Hardlink and reflink support for cross-seeds\n* ARR integration and other improvements for better cross-seed results\n* Live log streaming (Settings -> Logs)\n\n...and 50+ other improvements.\n\nFull changelog: [https://github.com/autobrr/qui/releases/tag/v1.12.0](https://github.com/autobrr/qui/releases/tag/v1.12.0)\n\nWe also moved to proper docs which you can find at [https://getqui.com](https://getqui.com)\n\nWith some of these new features you can get rid of other external tools and free up resources.",

And this token allows access to all 50+ grpc methods, including all administrative methods such as deleting buckets, deleting users, reading/writing/deleting objects, etc.\n\nThe bad news is that, per my understanding, the gRPC port is always open as it is exposed as part of the \"HTTP + gRPC hybrid service\" of RustFS. So in case your have a port open for HTTP traffic, which would be the standard to use for S3 clients, you also have the gRPC \"port\" opened automatically.\n\nOn top of that, it [looks like ](https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs/issues/1372)the CVE description might be wrong and this vulnerability is indeed already present in `Alpha.13` (of Jul 10, 2025) and not only since `Alpha.77` which means that a lot of RustFS deployments in the wild are vulnerable to this.",

That's an issue, sure, but the the entire \"hardcoded API token\" thing is entirely omitted. The Copilot summary comment completely misses this as well.\n\nI'm not going to say that this was intentionally swept under the rug in that commit. Instead, I'm going to lean on [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) as an explanation here.\n\nBut it is beyond comprehension to me that this could be introduced, reviewed, committed, and then fixed -- all without anyone realizing it until *after* it was resolved. I'm glad they did realize it, I'm glad they fixed it, but everything about this is just terrible.\n\nI was looking at using rustfs for a while now, but honestly, I just can't trust it. My gut tells me that it is heavily, heavily written by AI, and without the appropriate level of human review / understanding of what is going on. I can't prove that... but it is the most logical explanation that I can come up with.",

I don't know your custom metadata format but using an AI it would take a couple of minutes to have a basic working script.\n\nCome by the [discussions](https://github.com/itskovacs/trip/discussions) section, could help you out on this if needed 👍",

I think you need to significantly improve your documentation around the config.yml file and allow (show) how to properly mount it from a bind mount so it can be managed outside the container.\n2. I configured the google API and put in the API key, but autocomplete, etc does not seem to be happening and there are no errors in the log or way to troubleshoot.  Perhaps a validation is needed when the API key is entered to ensure that it is valid.\n3. Please also think about externalizing all appropriate values as environment variables (such as the google key, default longitude and latitude, etc, in order to make it automation friendly.\n4. Your documentation is unclear about which google APIs need to be enabled.  I believe it needs more than one based on testing (geocode/places).  It should tell exactly what are needed for those of us that have them disabled by default",

Someone mentionned this in the discussions as well, but I have not found a one-size-fits-all solution yet, since default coordinates, Google keys, and other parameters are user-specific, there's no admin environment variable for this.\n4.

One of my more used self-hosted apps.  \n  \nA couple of smaller issues I have:  \n  \n- I find myself zig-zagging across the screen a lot. The thing I probably do most is to browse/check my already saved Places. In order to do that I have to move my cursor all the way to the top right to click on Places. But then I have to move all the way to the left and click twice to be able to start typing the name of a place to find it. So that's three clicks spreed across the entire screen.    \n- I have trouble saving Places that are not places in Google Maps. I have a few Places that are random nature spots that I have determined by coordinates. But it seems like Trips will prioritize searching Google Maps API for the name I give it. I actually haven't figured out how to just stick to my coordinates at all. In the worst cases it will save a vaguely similar sounding place half the world away from where it is supposed to be.",

The app doesn't call the Google API unless you click the autocomplete button. You can simply paste coordinates in the latitude field, set a name, place, category, and optionally add an image for better visuals and you're done. Again, no autocomplete is made unless you explicitly click the *autocomplete* button.
