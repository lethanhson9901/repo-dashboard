Looking at that library now, it seems to have improved significantly, so I may give that another shot. While I did my best to implement within the spec, I would also be more comfortable leveraging a \"battle-tested\" library than a bespoke implementation.\n\n\n> As an update on the status of this PR generally, I am considering closing this and splitting it further into pieces, in hopes that it will be more likely to be reviewed in a timely manner (and also easier for me to keep up-to-date). As part of that work, I may explore a new server implementation using such a library instead of a hand-rolled and likely flawed implementation.\n\n\nSo my best guess is we either see it this year, or in another 4 years with a solid shmaybe",

Now, I would consider it essential\n\nI use jellyseerr (and soon seerr) to manage requests. I tell my users \"hey you have two options to ask for stuff. You are invited to call, text, or IM me asking for stuff. Alternatively, you can use this website.\" If someone makes a jellyseerr request, I have it configured to send a webhook to Home Assistant to instruct my color-changing bulbs to blink a specific pattern. My Philips hue bulbs bring me great joy from prior and them communicating to me there's a request is awesome. Connecting sonarr + radarr for automatic downloads is optional. I don't use this feature but the online userbase loves it\n\nIt is superb at looking at the history of requests. I have two annoying Plex users that make requests but then don't always watch them. I don't like that. When it happens, I want to know about it. It's a superb tool for saying \"hey why are you requesting so much and then not touching it?\" Seerr has a feature to make requests for other people. If one of my Plex users asks me for something offline, I add a jellyseerr request in his name to keep track of it. Super handy.\n\nSeerr is fantastic from existing as a catalog. Remember that time years ago the first time you discovered and interacted with Newegg's or mcmaster's online catalog? It's super organized as hell, is fast, and it feels like it genuinely wants to show you what you're asking. Jellyseerr is fantastic for all things movie and shows. The interface is better than all the online ones for interacting with movie and shows.\n\nIn conclusion, try it. Run it on a Raspberry Pi or a disposable virtual machine. Interact with it. Shut it down if you don't like it.",

But family emergency happened and I had to leave home for a few weeks. Contacted courier and seller to try and arrange alternative collection but courier just left it on my doorstep out in the rain, eventually courier agreed to return to location to retrieve package and hold for me to collect on my return but it's now gone missing. Seller told me to do one as well as courier and eBay\n\nBut after appealing to eBAY UK, I eventually got my refund thankfully, but the prices have shot up again and now its going to cost me at least another additional £100 for the same pair if I can find them in stock.

Let's not forget docker uses the host's kernel.\n\nEither way: kernel update = downtime. Arch updates the kernel pretty often. As is, more than once a week. Sure you don't *have* to update your system that often, but I guess if someone picks arch, then surely that must be something they are after. But then again, they use it as a docker host so that's pretty conflicting.\n\nI too use Arch and I too at some point thought it was simpler to just stick to the one distro I'm the most familiar with but really nothing beats having the right tool for the job. Just go with a stable LTS distro, slap the docker repos on it, configure unattended upgrades to your liking, schedule some periodic reboots and forget about it.",

              "text": "When one of my early servers died, it was basically a nightmare both because i didn't really have any backup of the server install (media was fine) so it took me a couple of days to rebuild it with all of the dependency and installation management, and then all of the configuration for all of the services. At that time, I built it in a VM instead and started snapshotting, but that also had some downsides. Updates could still be fraught and break stuff, and snapshotting took up a lot more backup space than I would have liked.\n\nDocker and docker-compose make that a bajillion times easier. Dependency management is gone and it basically becomes as easy to add services as it is to grab something from the app store. Docker compose also means that I don't need to backup anything other than my docker-compose.yaml and the config directories for the services I use, so that's just a git repo that I push when there are changes. So if I lost my media server today, I could basically install whatever distro (most server distros are going to come out of the box with docker and git) do a ``git pull`` and ``docker-compose up -d`` and I'm off to the races. It would probably take less than a half hour for me to go from bare metal to my server as it runs today. Well, maybe slightly more depending on internet speed. \n\nI'd suggest people check out [Yet Another Media Server](https://yams.media/) if you want to dip your toes in. It's basically a script that sets up docker-compose with the typical *arr stack, plex/emby/jellyfin, and at least torrents with easy integration of VPN.",

You could do the same with a VM, but docker is lighter. The other big one is it's relatively simple to lift and shift things around since docker compartmentalizes it. With a docker compose file, you just copy that file and run the compose up command to pull and start all those containers. If data and paths and environment variables are consistent then you just migrated everything to a new machine.",

Very portable in that you can just copy it over to another system and other than having docker you don't need to set anything else up in the host OS and it will just run... Usually.

It obviously came with Zima OS installed, and after a lot of internal debate I decided to stick with it instead of installing an alternative. So far I have really enjoyed it.

It's federated, and is basically a Discord clone with extra (Actual useful) features that people have asked for for years. While they don't have self-hosted docs up yet, it apparently is self-hostable. \n\nThat being said, I am a bit worried about their monetization. While I think it's pretty neat that they give everything for free on self-hosted (and let you even turn on your own monetization). I feel like it's either going to be one big server on their end, and they won't be able to support the costs. (Discord was upside down until recently, likely due to 'quests') or very disorganized self-hosted severs. The problem is the 'premium' doesn't transfer to other instances. So if you buy it for their instance, won't transfer to community instances. (Which makes sense, don't get me wrong). But for ease-of-use, federated apps are confusing for people. I can already see someone upset they spent 50$ then join a server and they don't have their 'perks' or something. \n\nAdditionally, from looking at other alternatives, it seems the big gatekeeper to self-hosting this stuff is amount of users and processing power/storage/bandwidth. I forget which project it was, but it basically noted that for Discord to host a single server of 100 people, it must be blowing away money hosting the text, images, VOIP encoding/decoding to multiple users, video encoding/decoding, etc. Now if you scale that up to server with even more (One of mine I run is ~5000 users) it's likely out of the realm of actual self-hosting.",

Because it's not about the technology, it's about the user base. No-one cares about privacy when it comes down to it, and we will tolerate a lot of abuse before we make the switch.\n\nIt's something these companies think about every day. Just exactly how much they can get away with turning up the heat without the average user noticing or caring. And they're getting better at it every day.\n\nWe can sit here on Reddit and complain all we want (as is our god given right), but the tech landscape is fundamentally just a lot dumber than it used to be. People just want things to work and they'll sacrifice a lot of agency to get there. It's the flipside of how accessible everything has become.\n\nI don't want to give the impression that I don't think it's good to push for alternatives, I think it's important. Just pointing out there's a fundamental problem at the core here; history has shown you need positive incentives, not just negatives, to migrate users over.

Discord is a Chat/forum platform with calling.\n\nEveryone wants a Discord killer with the same features as discord.

And sadly because of the UK/Australian governments a new \"social\" platform will have to do the exact same thing (eventually).\n\nIf you want to have your privacy, if you want to not have your chats scanned, if you want to not have to age verify yourself. Then it can't be a public company hosting a SAAS!

I didnt decide for a discord alternative yet, looking at XMPP and the development progress of fluxer right now. And maybe mumble for voice chats. For messaging SimpleX seems the best for privacy but the mobile app needs optimization imo, not sure about other platforms.",

Im also unsure how much I trust a furry blog, but thats just me.\n\nThing is that XMPP is absolutely unsuited for providing a discord alternative. Im not aware of any XEP that defines voicechannels - a feature that matrix also lacks - but the worst thing is both the lack of modern clients and the hoops you need to jump through to get a modern chatting experience.\n\nSure, theres Conversations that works very well, but thats about it. The only semi modern UI on desktops im aware of is provided by Gajim - and that UI is still absolutely horrible. There used to be inconsistencies with certain XEPs, but thats in the past by now I think.\n\nBut if you want to enable proper encrypted stanzas, if you want file uploading and so on you need to configure all those things yourself. And its not fun, at all. I also dont remember there being a registration mode that uses tokens, as is offered by matrix, however to be frank at some point I just created the accounts by hand and sent the passwords to the three family members I want to chat with, with the plea to change passwords first.\n\nThe main argument for matrix right now is both the featureset for modern chatting applications that it has integrated, the easy registration of users and the ability to verify new devices with features OOTB.",

Honestly I think that  we need to move away from the old \"1 stop shop\" applications that try to do everything and move back to individual services.\n\nI currently use TeamSpeak / Mumble / Jitsi Meet as my alternative for voice comms with my community if / when Discord has issues and for communication I use services like Telegram but I also have in the past used XMPP (Prosody, and I am looking at self-hosting again) and I have self-hosted Matrix (But I don't like the state of the homeservers and the community drama. Also not sure of the privacy comment), and if I want to actually have a community I'll probably host a web forum like the good old days (although, Valour App looks promising).\n\nI think that changing our attitude back to the KISS principle and having different services for different purposes is a *good thing* and hopefully communities will go back to Wikis and Forums instead of using private Discords for literally everything. Discord unfortunately has deflated the value of voice / text services to the point where everyone expects something for free even though it's costly to maintain and I think that's a shame.",

Discord seems like a home brew app in comparison. \n\nWhat Discord should do is leave the free version as is and not fuck with it, but create a \"Discord Pro\" version and make it more like Teams to attract business customers. As it is right now, there is no competition for Teams and Discord is the closest thing, but an awful alternative. If they make a \"Discord Pro\" and it is good as Teams, it can be very lucrative for them.

Navigating webRTC and STUN/TURN servers can be a nightmare, not to mention going across mobile and home networks.\n\nPersonally, I have a working replacement in Rocketchat and a Jitsi based video backend, including a turnserver. Rocketchat has Jitsi integration in the app store. It has a nice ui that you can customize with CSS. If you have a small server(under 50 people) you can get the \"starter edition\" which you will have to go through their servers to get reliable push notifications on mobile, otherwise they can be spotty. If your server is larger than that, the community edition is up to 500 people, but read receipts and push notifications to mobile probably wont work(Edit I just checked, they do work but are capped at 10 000), as nothing runs through rocketchat main servers. That being said there is E2EE available and with either option.\n\nJitsi can be a bit confusing, its actually 3 modules(videobridge, prosody for auth, 1 more) and you WILL have to edit config files to get proper performance, and security by properly setting shared secrets. That being said I have found it better than zoom once you set it up properly. Jitsi has docker as well but again you will have to know how to edit config files or properly set volumes/bind mounts in docker to make it easy (which you should know if you want to use docker anyways).\n\nSo yes you can, but it might be above the skill level and patience of most people.\n\nEdit: a turnserver can be tricky to set up with reverse proxy. SNI mapping is your friend in that case (at least with nginx).",

This means the app receives only a unique, provider‑generated user ID, no mail, no name, no profile picture, no personal data at all, and then simply choose a nickname inside the app. This keeps onboarding simple, avoids storing sensitive data, and removes the need for admins to manually create accounts.\n\n**2. Zero‑bandwidth media handling through client‑side uploads (integrated in the UI)**  \nBesides the ability to embed any external link directly (classic URL embedding), the app should also support a seamless client‑side upload flow integrated into the UI.  \nWhen a user uploads a file, the app would send it directly from the user’s end to an external hosting service (e.g., Imgur, ImgBB, Catbox), without ever passing through the self‑hosted server.  \nThe external service returns a public URL, and the app automatically embeds it in the message.  \nThis keeps the instance extremely lightweight and avoids both bandwidth and storage costs.\n\nWould something like this be possible or even make sense? Do existing applications already implement features like these?",

But they don't sell a bundle for 1,300 points, they sell one for 1,000 and then one for like 500, or something like that. So there's no way to pay exactly for what you want in that scenario.

I commented on another post of yours asking for a comparison to Ruddarr which I use and this honestly has some ‘small’ differences which stand out as giving a better UX (personally ofc). I particularly like the clear indication to what service you’re viewing and the calendar/schedule view looks great and something I could actually use reliably!\n\nNot sure what extra features I’d like to see other than hopefully some form of customisable notification functionality. I’d also be more than happy to contribute to the product with a (non-subscription) lifetime license if you end up offering one.\n\n>iOS/iPadOS user.",

Level 1 includes 720p60 and Level 2 includes 1080p60. Considering Level 1 is just 2 boosts (meaning anyone with Nitro can add it for free) and Level 2 is 5 boosts (3 people) basically any server that has a dozen active users is likely to have at least that.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's free, but it's basically inconsequential. There's no reason Matrix should be limited to such low video rates in the Year of Our Lord 2026. Now, having a server able to **handle** that kind of streaming is a different question.\n\n  \nThere's no self-hosted option that's going to replace things like our EverQuest guild server that might have 3 channels going at once with \\~50+ in each, with at least a few of them actively streaming to it. This kind of situation is exactly what made Discord popular in the first place, and why it's going to be really hard to get rid-of.",

Streaming and encoding also takes a lot of cpu and you will have some potatoes pc out there. Do you also stream and full hd, but consume in what? Usually you will have to separate streams by resolution, so you dont stream 4k to a pc configured to receive 720p, meaning you have to buffer multiple times. How much you buffer as well, how does the clients catch up with delayed transmissions, what controls the user has when it is receiving transmission. Do you allow people to share the screen? What do you do with the audio of the transmission if the person is sharing the screen. Etc etc",

I'm sure if you have a small group of very employed, not that terminally online and non-stubborn people then moving everyone over to a Matrix based client would be fine to use as a group chat where you can get in a group call and play a game once a week. But for the people that use Discord like Discord I (sadly) don't think Element using Matrix is or will be a serious replacement.\n\n  \nI would like some form of decentralised self-host platform to win out though. I am not blindly hating on Matrix and did and still do want it to succeed but after trying to do this months ago it wasn't a fit. I just don't see how anything other than self hosted can be a real replacement for Discord because moving from one centralised service to another is not worth annoying your friends over.",

You can have 320kbps audio and 4k60 fps for free (might be more, depends on your system rigs and internet, Video streaming are p2p)\n\nOverall TeamSpeak 6 is good when you do not care about anything at all but a minimal app to just team and speak with your friends. Good audio and video quality,  file upload sucks, can't have more than 32 people.\n\nThat's it for now I guess, if you want a TRUE DISCORD experience then sadly there're none.

The documentation gives you an example nginx config with the whole CORS thing being a simple comment below. \"But Element is a desktop app. It wouldn't need that anyway. Also it's just a comment below and not included as part of the example config. So it's irrelevant. I'll just forget about it.\" So you copy it believing it's complete and end up troubleshooting the whole 3-container config structure ad nauseum until you realize you can just do ctrl+shift+i in the chromium tab that calls itself app to find out it's fucking CORS.\n\nThat CORS thing, and the multi-container config nightmare, and the push notification app requirement thing are three separate blunders that make an otherwise cool and exciting thing a very frustrating experience.",

It has a lot of small issues that keep popping up, some of that is client specific, some is server, and some is protocol. Message read indicators are wonky, threads are inconvenient, notifications sometimes just disappear.... None of that is a big deterrent on its own, but it all adds up.\n\nThen there are the big issues. Sometimes the encryption can break and you're left unable to read people's messages. The only fix for that is waiting and hoping it fixes itself. Granted, I haven't had that happen in a while, but who knows if it's actually fixed or just pure luck.\n\nFrom the hosting perspective it's also a nightmare. I'll leave the server setup troubles, there's been plenty said about that. If you enable federation, your users can join a server that has illegal content, that gets cached on your server and suddenly you're hosting illegal materials. Or someone can make a private encrypted room which you as the owner can't moderate, and who knows what can go on in those.\n\nI'll be honest, I've been very optimistic about matrix 5 years ago when it was starting to get popular. But the same issues I've had then are still there, and instead of hearing about fixing those, I'm gearing about the devs getting into more and more dramas",

If you enable federation, your users can join a server that has illegal content, that gets cached on your server and suddenly you're hosting illegal materials. Or someone can make a private encrypted room which you as the owner can't moderate, and who knows what can go on in those.\n\nThis is the biggest thing for me. I'm fine hosting authentication/keys for my users to get access to other servers, but I don't want to have another server's traffic piped to mine. The people I'd have on my server I don't think are going to be doing skeevy stuff, but if they join a server that gets compromised it could cascade to mine.",

If you have a user which joins a naughty groupchat it will be mirrored to your server. I have no clue how to manage keys for users who are not tech savvy.\n\nIt's also a privacy nightmare since everything is mirrored in all locations. I'm quite sure it's actually a honeypot for intelligence agencies. The load on the server is also really high and gets ridiculous if you have a lot of federated users.\n\nIt's explained in detail here : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8KEuAEYjQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8KEuAEYjQ4)",

          "text": "This matrix.org article captures it well?\n\n> Finally: we’re painfully aware that none of the Matrix clients available today provide a full drop-in replacement for Discord yet. All the ingredients are there, and the initial goal for the project was always to provide a decentralised, secure, open platform where communities and organisations could communicate together. However, the reality is that the team at Element who originally created Matrix have had to focus on providing deployments for the public sector (see here or here) to be able to pay developers working on Matrix. **Some of the key features expected by Discord users have yet to be prioritised (game streaming, push-to-talk, voice channels, custom emoji, extensible presence, richer hierarchical moderation, etc).** Meanwhile no other organisation stepped up to focus on the “communication tool for communities” use case and provide a production ready Discord alternative, but clients like Cinny or Commet may feel much closer to Discord. On the other hand, Matrix goes far beyond Discord in other areas: both messages, files and calls are end-to-end-encrypted; we have read receipts; Matrix is an open protocol everyone can extend, and in the end, most Matrix clients are open source; there is nothing stopping developers from starting their own project based on existing ones and adding the missing features themselves. They may even eventually get accepted in the original projects!\n\nhttps://matrix.org/blog/2026/02/welcome-discord/",

I literally have more than 50 open threads I cannot delete, and they come back / are restored when I reflashed even my Android device and installed a new or different client.\n\nI don't understand how the server and protocol implementation can be _this_ buggy. It's just a riddle to me how anybody can be fine with those types of bugs and not throw their smartphones out of the window.\n\nFor now my faith in matrix kinda died out, and I think something like an xmpp server would be more reasonable (if the clients fulfill OMEMO + XEPs for OTR stuff, which is a whole other story of compatibility issues) for most chat related things. If I need a voice chat with friends, I would host a mumble server (which is pretty close to what Teamspeak was at the time).\n\nContact management and contact discovery is also an issue on its own, because most chat clients assume you know all the handles / urls / identifiers which normal people actually never do if they want to contact you.\n\nBriar, for example, is unusable in practice because of that, because you effectively cannot discover contacts. Both contacts at the same time have to know each other's identifier that you have to have sent via third-party communication channel, and on top of that simultaneously have to do a handshake request; which effectively never works when people aren't standing exactly next to each other. Their NAT breaking techniques also never work in normal environments outside of carrier-grade NATs so most people always tell me that Briar never works because it silently fails to connect/discovery peers and contacts without any hint on why it didn't work.\n\nThe drama of revolt (aka stoat chat now until the next ADHD rebrand) is too much for me to get into right now, so I haven't tried that out yet. But from what I've heard it's pretty similar to Slack in how you use it.\n\nWhen thinking about the \"golden days\" of xmpp and jabber and gmail/facebook chat betas and the interoperability of chat clients like Trillian and Pidgin... man, it kinda went straight downhill from there.",

That's not to say there aren't problems with AI solutions. \n\nNamely:\n1. They tend not to scale well - AI is good at beelining for a working solution but doesn't have the human ability to intelligently optimize a design to be easy to work on in the future or performant (necessarily)\n2. They can suffer from deep security issues that you may not even be aware of (similar reasons to above)\n3. Fundamentally, you're missing out on the learning process of creating something and therefore both miss the opportunity to up skill and risk creating something you don't understand and therefore cannot support\n4. It's easy to very quickly pump out crap that looks passable on the surface, making it much harder overall to curate good software.\n\nBUT\n\nIf you're designing a simple app that doesn't need to scale or be secure (it's primarily designed for a simple internal usage and doesn't handle sensitive data), and if you're not interested/don't have time to really learn how to do something but just need a quick solution that doesn't exist already and aren't trying to market it as something that it isn't - *I do not see the issue in using this as a means to an end*. It solves a problem. It does something useful for OP. OP is honest about the use of AI and doesn't promise amazing support or market themselves as a great coder.

Firefox comes default with the Cira DoH [1] that was effectively bypassing my local DNS because the browser never used the system DNS resolver via port 53 instead it directly queried the DoH port 443 which got slipped through the cracks of firewall for good reasons lol (pun intended).\n\nNow when I block DoH servers from the firewall then the browser fell back to the old school DNS \n\nLinks:\n1. https://www.cira.ca/en/canadian-shield/configure/chrome/",

No one accuses an electrician of cheating for using a voltage tester instead of licking the wire. Tools exist to remove unnecessary suffering.\n\nVIBE coding is just high-level intent expressed in human language, the same direction we’ve been moving for decades:\n            \n    assembly -> C\n    C -> higher-level languages\n    manual config -> automation\n    docs -> code generators\n            \nBut this is where we draw the line?

That’s normal.\n\nVibe coding isn’t about avoiding learning — it’s about compressing the discovery phase. If I need something working today, spending a week digging through docs and Stack Overflow isn’t some moral victory. Time is money, and shipping matters.\n\nAlso, this idea that it’s “not faster” just doesn’t line up with reality. Getting a rough but functional implementation in minutes, then reading it, understanding it, and modifying it, is often far quicker than starting from a blank file. I still have to understand the code to maintain it — the learning happens either way.\n\nThe “commissioning an artist” analogy doesn’t really hold up either. Programming isn’t art — it’s engineering. If I specify requirements, constraints, inputs, outputs, and then validate, test, and integrate the result, that’s no different than using:\n\na framework\n\na code generator\n\na compiler\n\na boilerplate template\n\nNobody says you didn’t “really code” because you used requests instead of writing a TCP stack.\n\nAnd yes, learning Python is great — I do that constantly — but pretending the only valid way to learn is the slowest possible one is just romanticizing inefficiency. In the real world, professionals balance learning, tooling, and delivery.",

Coding is a really important part in it, as everyone can imagine! The 'funny' thing is that coding takes up maybe 60-90% in the first stages (Depending on many many factors). However, after these stages, it can quickly shrink down to only take up 10-30% of the total work.\n\nSoftware Engineering is as much developer stuff, as is coordinating people (which also takes a hefty amount of social skills at a certain point), political stuff with stake holders, and architecturing something that's (according to your foresight) will be able to solve the issues you're facing today and tomorrow.\n\nAI may pose a major shift, like it hasn't happened since the switch from Assembly to higher languages like C. It's going to stay however, because it's actually good writing small-ish pieces of code - Yet again, look above, that's a surprisingly small part of the job.\n\nI'll leave it at that for this sub :)\n\nBut for what you should be concerned about: You're building that project for yourself first, and everyone else second. In fact, having many users in a open source project poses a dilemma many maintainers of major projects would love to be without. So, just continue, if just for yourself. And if someone likes your project, he'll give a star, maybe even contribute. And if not? Who cares, you did solve **your** issue :)",

It is \\*not\\* professionally developed to consider all use cases, maintainability, reduce bugs, etc. There should be the expectation that the software developer can read and review all AI code to determine if it's making the right decisions. Context matters, AI has no context. I use it for configuration and often it makes stuff up and when I ask for its sources (critical question) there are none. It often just makes up random syntax. In the wrong hands it's scary.  AI needs guidance. There is a place for mentors like this, both for AI and vibe coders.  Logically, vibe coding is great for prototypes and small use-cases where there is no wide-impact but scaling to something long lasting? It needs help. It's just a tool. We need to understand that tool's strengths and weaknesses.",

When objections were raised he admitted the lack of threads and the near impossibility of finding answers in the history was \"an issue\", but he pressed on regardless.\n\nMy personal theory is that we're seeing a generation of people who grew up with a cell phone in their hand, so their first experience of networked communication was via some sort of text message or chat app. As a result, everything on the internet, including persistent text forums like Reddit, they treat it like a chat portal. Another subreddit I'm on had a meta post suggesting that the subreddit turn off the bot that copies the body of the main post into the first comment  because \"people like to be able to delete their old posts\", completely failing to understand that the great strength and arguably the *purpose* of a persistent text forum is the ability to look back and find information. It certainly explains a lot of the question posts you see everywhere that Google would have returned the exact answer as a top result, if only they'd typed their post title into Google.",

And I was not interested in jumping back into hosting that again either so we moved on to other options. \n\nMatrix ended up not being an option. \nThe people wanted their Emojis, Gifs, and Calls. Of all the matrix clients - none support all 3. We moved on.\n\nWe took a look at Root - but their TOS was a instant pass. We did not even try installing it. It just looks like a trap with a draconian view of users. \n\nWe're leaning on Fluxer for our future space and are currently spending a lot of time there while we see how things move. \n\nSo far - its everything we wanted with a few bugs that are getting worked out. \n\n---\n\nFor your list of wants - here's my experience with Fluxer over the last couple days: \n\n**Hard requirements:**\n\n* Discord-like Onboarding UX \n  * The experience is nearly 1:1 for Discord onboarding\n  * We re-made most of our channels and users just joined without issue. \n* Multiple text and voice chat channels\n  * Supported. \n* Decent Mobile Experience\n  * Currently only available as PWA - Mobile apps expected in 1-2 Months per the Developer chats. \n  * It's not great - but is good enough for now. \n* Self-hostable\n  * Currently yes - although opaque. \n  * Docker based Self Hosted methods are \"coming soon\"\n\n**Nice to have:**\n\n* Free and Open Source (FOSS)\n  * Yes - and public development / PR Opens should begin soon according to the Dev.\n* Minimal Vibecoding\n  * The Developer addressed this in [This blog post](https://blog.fluxer.app/how-i-built-fluxer-a-discord-like-chat-app). \n  * Their response seemed acceptable and believable to me. \n  * Using the app - it does not feel vibe-coded. \n* End-to-end Encryption\n  * Currently no - Opt-in is on the roadmap. \n  * Personal opinion - this is not actually wanted for a service like this. In concept it sounds nice. More encryption == more better right? In practice - you'll see more of the complaints of many people bitten by Matrix-style flubs where their messages disappear, or only some people can see others. For 1:1 messages, this is a good thing to have. But for large public spaces - it offers little benefit and a lot of potential for failures.\n* TTL-ed messages\n  * [Yes - for messages with files](https://fluxer.app/help/en-us/articles/1447193503661555712-how-attachment-expiry-works-on-fluxer)\n  * Semi related - A deletion clause is present in the [Privacy Policy](https://fluxer.app/privacy#7-data-retention)\n* Screensharing and video chat\n  * Yes, and does it well. Some of the larger calls I've been in had dozens of people, and many screenshares. Overall it was stable and clear. The ability to see multiple streams at once was also a nice touch. \n\n\nOur plan at the moment is to use the Fluxer.app main server - and then poll the group about whether or not to self-host once the refactor is complete. Our group is much smaller and more tight-knit so these kinds of moves are pretty easy for us. This is not meant to tell you \"Move all your users to fluxer right nao!\" - just providing some insight on my experience over the last few days, and my overall mood on the project is optimistic. \n\nRight now I'm just following the dev chats and the [Github](https://github.com/fluxerapp/fluxer) and seeing where the ride goes.",

Took a bit of poking around to get it all up and running, and it was definitely not lightweight, as mentioned. I ended up allocating a 8c 16Gb machine to get it stood up - and had some concerns about long-term stability on what's currently available in the github. It was not \"hard\", as most of what you need is in the compose. But some knowledge of initializing the databases is needed to get everything flowing. \n\nI did also chat with the Developer a bit in the Dev channels on their main server, and while they have quite a bit of work to hit the goals they've stated, they do seem achievable, especially with a little help. Overall they seemed competent, if not a little ambitious. \n\nAs far as the licencing goes - it doesn't seem too odd to me off the bat. But I also work in the FOSS space, so licencing like this is not an immediate red flag for me. You aren't wrong to be skeptical, but in my experience there are plenty of projects both small business and big that have free self-hosted models and a paid hosted option, with licences similar or equal to this. But you're correct that some caution is warranted for something so new. \n\nPersonally - I buy the premise of funding early for a \"good enough\" product to avoid external investment and solidify cashflow to develop and expand. I would be very surprised to see this be a rugpull, but I'm also not too concerned as I have very little to lose in that situation. If their plans do come to fruition I expect that I will maintain both a paid account on their main instance and a self-hosted one as well. \n\nI did buy into the membership as a sign of support for the project, and so far I feel good about that. If I end up a fool though... oh well I have made costlier mistakes. \n\nOverall though - so far so good.",

Similar to the blog author I've tried spinning up a lot of the various options and come away unimpressed with most of them, but using Fluxer feels like it's well thought out and very intentional, and doesn't give me the sense it was vibe coded (unlike many of the others).\n\nIn regards to E2EE encryption I agree with you as well, and the blog post you mention covers the developers awareness of the issues that Matrix has had with that very issue. I'd like to see a roadmap for Fluxer include E2EE (opt in) for private messages, but it's not the most pressing issue.\n\n>Our plan at the moment is to use the Fluxer.app main server - and then poll the group about whether or not to self-host once the refactor is complete. Our group is much smaller and more tight-knit so these kinds of moves are pretty easy for us. This is not meant to tell you \"Move all your users to fluxer right nao!\" - just providing some insight on my experience over the last few days, and my overall mood on the project is optimistic. \n\nSame here, spun up a test server and getting people logged into the system to make sure it works, but looking to self host once that update rolls out. The expectation here too is that Discord will still be used in parallel for things like large community servers which take much longer to figure out their move, or may even remain on Discord, but that the information you reveal to Discord is minimized to whatever you're comfortable putting on public servers.",

          "text": "I've got a matrix server that's only two days old but we've already pulled in 40 of our most active discord users and my discord server (700 users) is now a ghost town. Onboarding was relatively painless other than myself not being totally clear in my explanation of how rooms and spaces work and not realizing that users would have trouble finding rooms that aren't auto joined, in some apps. We've been digging in on the privacy and security and access control features quite heavily, and I have to say my users are extremely pleased with that aspect, and don't seem too bothered by the recovery key and multi-device verification hoops. Even the non-techies seem to consider it a completely acceptable trade-off to truly own their data, be able to speak more freely about current events and personal matters without corpo and authorities looking over their shoulder, and have privacy even from me, the admin.\n\nThe various desktop and mobile apps all have their shortcomings. None of them are as comfy and cozy as discord, and in my short hands-on experience so far, each of them seems to be lacking some feature or convenience that one of the others provides. Personally I find fluffy or schildichat the most comfortable mobile experience and element best on desktop. \n\nI have intentionally left voice and video functionality disabled for now, and intend to dig in later this week. So I can't speak to that, but I really hope that it doesn't become the downfall of what seems to be a decent little private server. We rarely use it but when we want it, it needs to be there. I don't mind doing the heavy lifting to figure it out and make it work, I'm not mad if it's extra steps or requires a bit of maintenance. I accepted that when I volunteered to host all this for the community. \n\nIt was an easy deployment overall. I spent 2 months of on and off research and dabbling on a test instance, set up in various ways including some of the docker and Helm approaches, with a non-techie friend. I started fresh about 28 hours before scheduled launch. Straight Debian packages, a lot of googling, and about 16 hours of setup, documentation and onboarding guide, and hands-on user education on a livestream, and we were rocking. I was able to onboard dozens of users in the first couple of hours, technical issues have been far more minimal than I expected, and my dread and anxiety have turned to excitement and hope.\n\nResource usage has been much lower than OP's experience. We are currently running on a 4 vCPU 8gb VPS I pay 6/mo for. I will move everything in-house after I myself have moved house, I didn't want downtime for users or extra steps to temporarily migrate to VPS while I rebuild my lab, when that happens. With 40 users we are sitting at less than 1gb RAM - and it barely budged at all when we went from 0 to 40 so I'm pretty confident it's not going to balloon when a couple hundred lurkers have come over. CPU usage has remained around 10 to 15%, only spiking when new accounts are created, not budging at all even during very active discussions and media shares.\n\nOverall I'm not 100% satisfied but it's more than good enough, to all appearances so far. My users say they feel more comfortable, more respected, less exposed, and more tightly knit than we were before. They also seem to really appreciate the work that went in, saying they feel it demonstrates I value our community, and that this experimental migration has increased our collective trust even more. \n\nSo there we have it, just my own early-days experiences. I hope everyone finds an option that works for them, to create a home for the people and the things they care about.",

I liked Mattermost because of the UI, available apps and ability to expand with the use of plugins.\n\n  \nFluxer - The UI looks very similar to Discord, and as far as I have been able to tell, it looks like it'll function if not the same, very similar to Discord. The devs seem to be very engaged, and as far as I'm concerned - since Discord has announced that they will be doing the BS teen accounts, the devs seemed to have stepped it up with trying to get documentation and refactoring done as quickly as they can. That makes me feel like they care about their community.\n\nBoth are open source and great choices, but I've ran Mattermost and quit as soon as they started paywalling things, or at least the VoIP plugin I think it was. I am now locked in and waiting for Fluxer to have documentation out so that I can make that swap.\n\nMy backup plan is Root chat.",

                  "text": "Going through it I've found a couple of reasons to not use a Matrix frontend for a Discord replacement:\n\n- Ease of use for non-techies/non-power users: setup of your account and server is fairly non-intuitive, and comes with a number of decisions about where you place your home that are potentially difficult to undo or change.\n\n- E2EE failures are highly visible failures: even if they're uncommon, if you've got an active community and suddenly you can't use the space you created you're going to create distrust with the stability and viability of that platform. If you're going to use E2EE it's got to be rock solid or you risk people fleeing the platform for something that \"just works\".\n\n- Federation exposes spaces to risk: Cross contamination of content between spaces means that your hosted space could get illegal content cached on it. While federation is optional to some degree, if you're not doing it then you're missing out on the benefits of the system as a whole and may as well run something else.\n\n- Difficulty in administering federated spaces: tooling and permissions for federated spaces are limited in what you can do for your own space to limit the above risk, not because the tools aren't powerful enough but because by it's nature federation makes it difficult to manage and remove spaces. Some of the more granular settings are also somewhat opaque in what is being shared where (like federated vs. non-federated rooms within a space).\n\n- What happens when a federated space is deleted: There's a [fun blog post](https://blog.erethon.com/blog/2023/06/21/what-happens-when-a-matrix-server-disappears/) on this subject, but in that case they spun it back up and were able to get things running (with some hiccups). It seems like if a homeserver is deleted or removed (and doesn't come back), the users attached to that homeserver no longer exist. Your account is gone and you, as a user, have no way to get it back. This ties back to the first point about decisions that are hard to undo or change, one of which is where you register your homeserver.\n\nThese aren't reasons to pick Fluxer specifically, but they're why I (and my group) decided against going with a Matrix solution after doing some research and testing.",

Because of this slow development people have gotten more engrained in Discord.

We don't ask you to disclose this, since we assume you're acting in good faith: you're the one who signs off on the patch you submit in your own name, and you have the technical understanding to verify that it's accurate.  \nThat said, don't use LLMs on areas of the codebase you don't understand well enough to verify the output.

Reddit-style posts with upvotes and nested comments, and admins can flip a toggle to make individual forums publicly readable and indexable by search engines. Seems like that solves the \"information goes to die in Discord\" problem without needing a separate Discourse instance. Also building real search with operators (from:, in:, has:, before:) because Discord's search being broken is genuinely unforgivable at this point.

I had very frustrating experiences before I understood where Matrix is at in their developments. They have made a ton of changes, and that's why all these new features need Element's web client to work (a weird hybrid atm), and Element X on mobile. That's really how things are right now, but the video chat is impressive when you use the right clients. It wont always be this way.\n\nI disagree that it's \"back where we started with Discord\" because Matrix is nowhere near as mature as Discord, and if it was it wouldn't be the abomination that is.\n\nMatrix has been hard at work trying to implement features to compete with Discord. Yes, you need to use the specific clients right now, but that's no different than Discord.\n\nYou can wait for all these alpha platform projects to develop, but in that same time Matrix will get their game together.\n\nI wish you the best. Unless you shut down the Discord server completely, people will stay there. Those people are Discord people. Most of them.\n\nYou can downvote me for that opinion, I have experience with lots of large communities but I don't care to share my identity openly here.",

I need a clear working voice chat and screen sharing and no, TS6 is not the answer with their ridiculous price package.\n\nThe only real big problem with discourse is that if you start accumulating a big database, it will struggle and you'll need a beefy machine. We have roughly 21GB in the posts table and are in the process of migrating out of a 30GB, 8 Threads, 200GB nvme machine because the RAM is just not enough.\n\nEdit: read it and yeah. agree with the general feeling. Also, great write up anyway. I'd appreciate a follow up if you ever decide to monitor this topic.\n\nI honestly think the FOSS space should focus on a video sharing, group call, voice solution rather than a full discord self hosting one. \n\nModern forums are basically like chats and even have chats included... plus, bonus, you can search what is discussed in a web search, unless you decide to set it to private. \nThey already satisfy PLENTY of the text chat side of discord.",

Guilded (now owned by Roblox) is better for gaming but not self-hosted.\n\n**For tech/dev communities:** Matrix (Element) is the clear winner. Federation is genuinely useful, E2EE works, and the bridge ecosystem means you can connect to Discord/Slack/IRC without abandoning existing users. The UX is improving but still rough.\n\n**For small friend groups:** Rocket.Chat or Mattermost if you want Slack-like. But honestly, a simple XMPP server with Conversations/Dino clients is underrated — rock solid, lightweight, and the protocol is 25+ years battle-tested.\n\n**For voice specifically:** Mumble is still unbeatable for low-latency voice. Nothing self-hosted touches it for quality.\n\nThe hard truth: nothing fully replaces Discord because Discord's moat isn't features — it's network effects. Your friends are there. The biggest challenge with any alternative is convincing people to actually switch.\n\nMy setup: Matrix for persistent chat + Mumble for voice + bridges to everywhere else.

                  "text": "As far as I can tell the study focused on Bitwarden, Lastpass and Dashlane because the source code was (partially) available and they are the most popular password mangers (apart from platform integrated ones from Google, Apple, etc.). They only performed an \"initial analysis\" of 1Password in the appendix. According to the key hierarchy in the paper it uses RSA-OAEP to store the vault key without any authentication of the ciphertext. The study describes a vault substitution attack exploiting this which allows a malicious server to replace your vault with completely attacker controlled data and allows the attacker to obtain any secrets stored in the vault after the attack. The impact of this attack is in my opinion worse than a combination of two attacks on Bitwarden (BW08 and BW11) and is even simpler than the corresponding Bitwarden attacks. The lack of authentication of (public) keys for vault sharing features is the source for a lot of the vulnerabilities in Bitwarden, Lastpass and Dashlane and is also present in 1Password (even ackknowledged in their security whitepaper). So while the study seems to not have investigated this issue in depth like for the other password managers, I think it is very likely that similar attacks are also possible in 1Password since the underlying issue is also present there. While Bitwarden for example has implemented mitigations for these attacks and is working on implementing key authentication, 1Password considers these attacks to be \"arising from already known architectural limitations\" and seems to not be interested in improving this. \n\nSo I think the lack of findings for 1Password is not because their security architecture and key hierarchy is better (imo it is significantly worse due to the use of RSA instead of authenticated AES for your own vault key) but rather because the study did not investigate 1Password in depth like the others because it is closed source, less popular and aware of the issues already (but not fixing it).",

Running it in Docker takes about 5 minutes and uses minimal resources — I've had mine running on a Pi for over a year with zero issues.\n\nThe real security analysis people should be doing isn't \"which cloud provider do I trust more\" but \"what's my actual threat model?\" For most people, the biggest risk isn't a sophisticated attack on their password manager's encryption — it's phishing, credential reuse, and not using 2FA. Any password manager, even a mediocre one, is infinitely better than the sticky note on the monitor approach.\n\nThat said, LastPass's breach response was genuinely terrible and they deserve every bit of criticism. But the lesson isn't \"password managers are unsafe\" — it's \"choose one that doesn't store your vault metadata unencrypted.\"",

If your server gets popped and you log in through the browser, the server can just serve you whatever JS it wants. Doesn't matter how good the crypto is at that point. Native clients and the browser extension don't have this problem since they're not served by the backend.\n\nHonestly for personal use, KeePassXC with the database on Syncthing has always been the simplest threat model. No server to compromise at all — just an encrypted blob that gets synced peer-to-peer. The tradeoff is convenience, but if you're already comfortable with a terminal, it's not much of one.",

Unfortunately it's since rebranded as Spectre and moved to a web app, and the multiplatform aspect of the project appears to be long dead. But I still use the old java app on all my computers. I doubt an unmaintained java app is the gold standard of password manager security, but I've never had to worry about any of these vulnerabilities and it's niche enough that I doubt anybody will target it specifically.\n\nI don't really understand why seemingly nobody else has taken this approach in their password manager, I guess as always everyone wants your data tied to their services.",

This is where things are getting more complicated since \"algorithm's new input\" must be somehow stored/managed.

There are big issues with this approach unfortunately. The biggest is that if you need a way to change passwords that have been compromised the only way to do that is to remember that you have chosen a different input for this particular site or to change the password for every site.\n\nAnother issue I ran into is that different services have different acceptable password criteria. So if the algorithm always generates a 12 character password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters you will run into services that do not accept special characters or have a strict length requirement that your output does not match. I solved this by adding switches to customize the output, but again I needed to remember which sites I enabled those switches for.\n\nMy script used an algorithm salted with a long string of random characters, then required an input of a \"master password\" and an custom input per site. Usually I would use something like \"reddit\" or \"google\" but quickly ran into another issue which was that I have multiple reddit and google accounts, so for some sites I had to use username+site and others just the site - another piece of data to remember.\n\nIn the end I found a password manager to be more flexible and solve all of these problems, while adding the tiny risk that someone could steal my vault. But someone could already steal my script, and discovering my inputs would not be impossible for someone who was targeting me.",

It's a good way to get new music based on your listening history. \n\n  \nIs it possible to make a filter/sorting (for results) or setting toggle for preferring mp3 /m4a, to save some space on hdd? Most of the time I'm okay with \"not the best quality\"-files.\n\n  \nI tried MusicGrabber on desktop and hover to preview is nice. But on phone it is not working and unfortunately the play button doesn't work for hearing preview, right? In my case it started the download but i want to hear a preview on phone too :( ",

Been using this since half a year and will never look back.\n\nToday I looked at the [open PRs on Komodo's GitHub page](https://github.com/moghtech/komodo/pulls) and noticed somebody has opened like 50 PRs within two days tackling various open issues. All the PR descriptions are most likely AI generated (which is perfectly fine) but my assumption is that the code might also be entirely vibecoded given the short time frame of the contributions. I'm not a Rustacean at a professional level but how will we ever be able to ensure quality of FOSS projects if this turns out to be true?\n\nDon't want to step on somebody's toes, maybe there is a hooded guy with an insane amount of ambition and insider knowledge to the project and energy drinks in a darkened room with green characters flying across the display just like a Hollywood hacker movie scene who managed doing this one handed while playing the entire single player campaign mode of Age of Empires 2. If this is the case - all my respect is yours.\n\nEDIT: To all the \"AI is the future\"-people: I got you. Treating AI as a productivity tool is absolutely fine, I do it, you do it, most devs do nowadays. Sure, anyone can vibecode an app in a breeze today that plays music from somewhere. But there are limits when anyone thinks he can become a professional dev engineer without understanding what the software does and why it does it. Applications quickly reach a level of complexity where AI has its limits. Try conjuring up some professional business software from scratch with an LLM. Or peek at regulated markets, such as software in hospitals or aviation. Not to mention the DevOps who set up the infrastructure on which distributed systems run and scale.\n\nIt's us professionals who have to judge whether what comes out of LLMs is good, according to whatever standards. You don't let Gemini make trading decisions for you with full access to your broker. It's no different with programming. And no developer wants to read through pages of hallucinatory source code (here's my problem I wanted to spotlight with my original post implicating risks for the FOSS community) that might somehow does what it's supposed to do, if they have to find a small bug in there that cripples the entire system.\n\nI'm not worried about my job. On the contrary, I'm grateful for the new tools that make us more productive when we know how to use them properly. But a hammer stays a hammer and does not become a carpenter on its own.",

They were usually too large to review sensibly, with a lot of issues and feedback coming out of them. So recently, I've implemented a \"no vibe code\" contributor guideline, which seems to have calmed the submissions a bit. It even spawned a fully vibe-coded fork, which is fine as long as they follow the licence.\n\nIn my opinion, do what feels right for you. It's your project, your standards, and also because you're the one who needs to handle the fallout (issues/bugs) from those submissions. I am personally a lot stricter now, rejected a few, which has its downsides for contributors, but it does keep my project at the level of quality that I envision.",

The other implication of this is that really convincing but not really good code is even harder to review.\n\nSo the effort to produce code by drive by goes down and the barrier of entry goes down, but volume of review goes up and the difficulty of the review goes up. Which means a massive transfer of work from non-maintainers to maintainers. Who are not known for having oodles of spare capacity.\n\nIn other words, vibe coding is a solution to the wrong problem, regardless of how fast it is. And the downsides are exacerbating the actual challenge. So, lose-lose!",

Like... errors aren't useful (error 500 instead of \"your compose file is malformed\"). \n\nYou have to stop an entire stack before you can do an update (used to be able to just make the change and click update, and it'd do the steps of stopping then re-deploying the stack). \n\nMy favourite thing is that you can't \"update\" a stack unless you make a change - makes logical sense, except I used to use this approach to re-pull image updates. Now i have to add or remove a space to the compose file to be able to click update and re-pull. \n\nI requested a new licence code a week ago as I got a notification mine was expiring and I have heard nothing. Last time i had to contact them to follow up on it so this isn't new. \n\nA bit disappointed. I'm giving Komodo a try and it looks pretty good so far.",

If you use IoT devices like cameras, light switches etc., assign them a separate vlan, they should not be on your main network.\n\n\n2. Try to keep your services isolated as much as possible, docker compose is a good start.\n\n\n3. Don't expose anything that doesn't need to be exposed, and even then, try to see if a reverse proxy/vpn tunnel is good enough for your use case. I don't expose anything personally, and use Tailscale for remote access and Playit tunneling for my game servers. A cheap vps for reverse proxy works good as well.\n\n\n4. Run Crowdsec/fail2ban (I personally use Crowdsec for a more active approach).\n\n\n5. Pihole is great!\n\n\n6. It might be obvious, but use strong passwords and 2fa where possible.\n\n\n7. At the end of the day, we aren't a big tech company with millions of credit cards data and a target sign on our forehead. Of course it's a good habit to keep everything safe and secure, but don't forget to enjoy your home server!",

You also want to practise minimal exposure - only absolutely necessary ports are open, firewall blocks by default, services are locked down to unprivileged accounts etc. These are measures that you perhaps do not need in a home setting, but are good to learn about.",

Google needs to defend against human hackers targeting them specifically and have hundreds of employees that can get hacked or bribed. Zero-Trust is essential for big corporations.\n\n> if you do bring malware into your network that just so happens to start scanning for vulnerable services\n\nI would argue that is a pretty big assumption here. \n* The most likely scenario is, that you bring in that malware yourself on your personal PC, which is already the highest value target anyway.\n* Since most networks don't have anything interesting going on, most malware won't bother to even try\n* If the malware tries to scan the network, it's more likely to attack other PCs directly (e.g. SMB, SSH, Remote Desktop) not whatever selfhosted Service you're running\n* Malware that is sophisticated enough to actually pivot inside the network is expensive enough, that it won't be deployed on a large scale and/or those attackers are not interested in your average Joe anyway\n\nThe key assumption here is, that you're only dealing with largely automated attacks. If you work for the CIA, you probably have to deal with targeted attacks. And to a lesser extend if you're just a low level employee in some interesting corporation (e.g. Google)\n\n> it's going to have a harder time spreading. SSL + auth for all internal services is a good baseline, [...] The only thing I skimp on internally is active protection such as F2B.\n\nAssuming the malware is already on your personal PC, can't they just read the unencrypted traffic and use a keylogger to get to the password? What about a supply-chain attack on a popular Service like Jellyfin? Or Notepad++?\n\nSpecifically fail2ban is a nice-to-have, but isn't actually doing that much for security. It reduces the signal-to-noise ratio in the logs and slows down brute-force attacks. However the application should not be brute-forceable anyway\n\n> because it also teaches you how to set such things up\n\nOnly interesting if you work in IT or want to\n\n---\n\nI'm not trying to argue, that you shouldn't do any security. I'm arguing you should understand how the Tools defend you against specific attack vectors and not just implement something because it sounds secure\n\nAnd yes.

A reboot completely killed it.

You're supposed to pay 50€ \\*\\*a month\\*\\* for that? What the hell?\n\n  \nScrolling through the list...yep, OIDC/SSO is behind the paywall. The docs make it seem like Let's Encrypt is free but the blog post introducing it mention it's a paywall feature as well. Let that sink in, a completely free service by Let's Encrypt and you have to pay for it anyway. \n\n  \nCaching? Paywall. Custom HTML pages for sites like /error? Paywall. User Management? Paywall.\n\n  \nIf you actually want someone to even look at your bug reports, you actually have to pay 150€ \\*\\*a month\\*\\*. Because 50€ \\*\\*a month\\*\\* is not enough. They even mention support \\*\\*by the community\\*\\* as a positive in the 50€ a month package.\n\n  \nMaybe its a thing like n8n, where you just get a free license key anyway? NOPE. You gotta pay for it.\n\n  \nI'm sure they're not paying the \\*community\\* to provide support for their 50€ product, or paying the \\*community\\* to write bug reports and make PRs.\n\n  \nI actually really liked the product and am so disappointed now. Genuinely pissed. It's important to make money even in FOSS, but with basic features paywalled like that? No thanks.",

The product suffers from recurring bugs: 2FA settings often reset, unexpected UI logouts are common, and the UI container itself is prone to crashing. From an enterprise perspective, the lack of native outbound proxy support and the inability to import CA certificates without manual Nginx overrides are major deal-breakers.\n\nWhile the core concept is solid (Nginx + ModSecurity + Web UI), the **€150/month** price tag is unrealistic for a product that would likely fail a professional POC within a week. Furthermore, the licensing system is easily bypassed, allowing access to Pro plugins with minimal effort.\n\n**To the Bunkerity team:** Your project has potential, but you need to build a stable power-user base before competing in the professional market. You are still miles away from the standards set by competitors like F5.

      "text": "I've spent the last few weekends building a voice chat server in Go to self-host for my friend group. The news the last few days around Discord and \\[yesterday's post asking for alternatives\\] made me finally document this thing and open-source it, figured others might be interested too.\n\nSo I just released GoSpeak v0.1.0, a privacy-focused voice chat server + desktop client (Windows & Linux).\n\nWhy I built this: I wanted voice chat without trusting Discord or TeamSpeak with our data. GoSpeak encrypts all voice traffic with AES-128-GCM and the server just relays packets without ever decoding audio.\n\nServer runs on two ports: TCP :9600 (TLS control plane) and UDP :9601 (encrypted voice). An admin token prints to stdout on first run.\n\n**Features:**\n\n* Encrypted voice chat (Opus codec, 48 kHz)\n* TLS 1.3 control plane (auto-generates certs, or bring your own)\n* Hierarchical channel system with sub-channels\n* Role-based access control (Admin / Moderator / User)\n* Token-based auth, share tokens with friends, no account system needed\n* Text chat per channel\n* Desktop client for Windows & Linux (native GUI)\n* YAML config for channels\n* Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboard included\n* Single binary per platform, SQLite database\n\nHonest about the crypto: The server generates the encryption key and distributes it to clients over TLS. It chooses not to decrypt, but a compromised server could. The trust model is: you run the server yourself, so you only need to trust yourself. I'll take that over trusting Discord any day.\n\nBuilt in Go, AGPL-3.0 licensed.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/NicolasHaas/gospeak](https://github.com/NicolasHaas/gospeak)  \nExample server you can join with the Client: [gospeak.haas-nicolas.ch](http://gospeak.haas-nicolas.ch)\n\nLet me know what you think! I might add it to the Unraid Community Apps repo too if there's interest.\n\n[Screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/jz6dj3a73jjg1.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=57675ef39a476c553c449ac20fc0b1ea3719c337)",

Opus is the gold standard for voice (low latency, good quality at 24-32kbps), but implementation matters. Are you using opus-go bindings or cgo?\n\n**Group call scaling:** How do you handle multi-party calls? Mesh (everyone sends to everyone) gets expensive above ~4 participants. SFU (selective forwarding unit) is lighter but adds complexity.\n\n**Encryption:** You mention encrypted — is it E2EE (per-participant keys) or server-side TLS? E2EE in group voice is tricky because you need key rotation when people join/leave.\n\nThis is a hard problem space (I've debugged too many WebRTC deployments). Excited to see a Go implementation!",
