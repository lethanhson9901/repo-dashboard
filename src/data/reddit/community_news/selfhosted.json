In the age of spotify, people rather just have an algorithm that keeps suggesting new similar songs, and you pick the ones you like. Whereas if you download music, it's more of an effort to download a single song versus a whole album or artist discography. So, at least for me, I am more selective about finding artists and albums where I like most of the material. I guess physical media is like this too, and those used to CDs/tapes/records etc are after a similar experience.",

Wireguard also supports disabling itself on select WiFi networks, so when you’re on your home WiFi it doesn’t activate.\n\nNext up setup geoip blocking. Don’t do blacklisting, instead do whitelisting, only allowing the countries you expect traffic from. It’s security by obscurity, but it keeps the bots away.\n\nAnd no, it won’t gain you anything over what you have today, other than remove reliance on TailScale.",

We have the proxmox community lxc scripts which are very good but still it does not handle everything, plus doing the upgrade and all. I still use two applications as lxc i.e. pihole and tailscale. For the docker I created an ansible script for handling the upgrade part.\n\nOne mistake that I have done is I have truenas and debian as my VM. I just using truenas for setting up the RAID, backup, storage related. Nothing else I really use in truenas. I could have used truenas for my application setup as well but it was k8 based when I started now they have changed to docker. Or I could have done the other way around to get rid of truenas and just maintain the health checks, raid, backup manually from my debian.",

Helps a lot for transcoding and even for other application.  \nLooking at the RAM prices, DDR4 is enough for a home server atleast for me. But how much it'll depend on your need. I use 32Gb.  \nAlways select the cpu first and then go for the motherboard.  \nAlso before finalising the part, make a reddit post here or in r/homelab and check with other user whether everything seems fine if you are not confident.

Unraid has good raid storage options, so does cosmos cloud. You just need 1 parity, maybe one day if your more than 4 drives you can do 2. I use cosmos cloud and unRAID, which both use fundimentally same concept and it's very easy to setup. Basically 1 backup drive, but has to be the largest. \n\nHowever! Recommend setting up something like ironmount, which I think has been renamed? But it's a nice compression style backup, letting you backup to an external hard drive. I recommend an SSD if your putting it in your car due to moving a lot. \n\nThose are my opinions. Hope this helps, two easy steps. Been using jellyfin+immich +70 other containers for years now and have never had an issue. Except cheap sata controllers, don't use them!! \n\nGood luck!",

Could you rebuild? Could you endure the downtime? Would the disruption materially impact you? Redundancy in a self-hosting situation at home is often about the convenience of not having to sit down and rebuild everything (be it the OS or data) or restore backups.\n\nRedundancy become more and more important as you add drives. For each drive you add, the more likely it is that one will fail. This can be where we choose more between various configurations (RAID 5, 6, 10, etc.), and it's where you start sacrificing one or more drives worth of space for parity, allowing you to function through the loss of a drive. Different configurations have their own pros and cons, which can include the number of drives they can survive losing as well as read/write performance.\n\nBesides redundancy, also consider your **backup** situation. RAID won't help you to restore a deleted file, for example, or one hit by ransomware. A commonly advocated gold standard is the 3-2-1 rule, in which you have 3 copies of data (the original and two backups), on 2 different media, with 1 copy being in a different physical location (often the cloud, these days, but sometimes a friend or family's house). But at least have a backup somewhere, preferably on a different disk in a different computer. Then you can have the fun of asking yourself how much redundancy your backups need!\n\nHow much you stick to a strategy like 3-2-1 depends on how important the data is to you. Does it need to survive a catastrophic hardware failure (what if both drives in a mirror fail, or what if the entire computer gets fried or stolen)? Does it need to survive the house burning down? That may or may not be a concern.",

Photographer with RAW pictures, videos, teenage kids or selfie obsessed spouse, and many family members using starts pushing towards a higher need. Biggest thing with the backup is if you only do one, I would have a routine to backup each day and unplug it after. Every time I've lost a drive (other than one DOA), I could relate it to a power issue, or dropping it. Since we aren't dropping anything just protect the power by not powering it when not copying.

What does that matter to you? \n\nOnce you can understand how important your files are, then folks can make some suggestions. \n\nExample - you take a photo, that file has to be on the source photo taking device. Copy 0. You then send it to a NAS drive. How? Via a computer? \n\nPotentially now you have three copies. Copy 0, the computer’s temporary copy (t1) and the final resting place (s1). \n\nYou can’t really rely on t1. But you have two copies, until something happens to either C0 or S1. \n\nSo ideally you would back up S1 before C0 is purged.\n\n\nThe next thing you want to consider is how quickly do I need those files back. That will drive what the backup solution looks like - full disk copies, file copies etc…. \n\nWhat I’ve badly described here, is RPO and RTO. As others have said 321 rule. But also look at what RTO / RPO is about. It’s in my view missed by many 321 discussions.",

This only syncs the changes so can be quite efficient, plus the snapshot nature gives you point in time recovery if you accidentally delete something.\n\nNow that's quite complicated so depends how comfortable with it all you are.\n\nA NAS with RAID is the easy route but just remember you can sometime lose a whole array.",

You simply CAN'T lose them ... at all !\n\nFor this reason you want a \"resilient\" storage system that will protect you data integrity at rest, takes care of some tasks for you, automate backups etc.\n\nI would suggest looking into a RAID setup based on ZFS (Ex: TrueNas) or any additional system that can offer its features (Ex: Synology with BTRFS).\n\nThe reasons goes way ... waaaay far beyond simple data availability (uptime) :\n\n1. Automatic and periodical data scrubbing with self-healing capability (Bit Rot Protection) - Hence a \"striped\" based RAID on a capable file system (ex: ZFS)\n2. A more resilient \"infrastructure\" for your main archive vault  / \"source of truth\" - go RAID 6 . You want this to be as robust and self-resilient as possible and only rely on backups as disaster recover / worst case scenarios. Some will say RAID is for uptime, true ... but it's also for \"resilience\" aka \"recover from backups only in catastrophic events / total failure\".\n\nRAID 6 will give this \"resilience\" to your main vault, as much as possible without backup restores. Of course, you ABSOLUTELY need backups besides RAID (the old saying \"raid is not backup\").\n\n3. Automatic Backups On-site and Off-Site - manually shuffling hard drives and manually performing \"cloning\" between them is not a robust backup solution for a big list of reasons.\n\n4. Versioning - you want a versioning system in place in case of file deletion, ransomware etc. Ex: Snapshots.\n\n5. Automatic storage related tasks scheduling - Periodic Quick & Full S.M.A.R.T tests for disks , data scrubbing etc.\n\nAll of this ... for your life long, irreplaceable precious memories.\n\nIf it were only for movies or other replaceable media, sure, whatever works for you but family life-long memories deservers all your precautions and care.\n\nThese important precautions can be achieved only on a proper storage system ... something that few independent hard drives with some cloning software between them will not give you.",

Backup your valueable data somewhere else by means of 321 and consider a running media server only as a throwaway item, that may (will) fail some day in the future. \n\nAsk yourself the following questions:\n\nDo I WANT to host locally, oder do I HAVE to?\n\nCloud Storage often is cheaper, more reliable and way, WAY more flexible. Unless you exactly know what you're doing, you will be stuck with whatever drives you throw in a RAID. With RAID-Z you can expand a mirror by just throwing in a larger drive and resilvering. Don't know, if that works with other classical RAID modes, and I only have done it once.\n\nI run a VPS with 10TB Storagebox on Hetzner and it saves me a lot of headaches.\n\nPlaying around with hardware is fun and stuff, but the administrative overhead and costs have to be taken into account. too.\n\nIf you are worried about privacy, rclone can encrypt your stuff. If you are worried about redundancy, put a small nas at home for mirroring.\n\nYou don't have to run a nas with RAID 6 only to backup your family photos.\n\nFamily photos are mostly static and can be frozen on a cold storage or other drives much cheaper. Just don't rely on just one media type. Look up desaster recovery plans and 321 Backup strategy If you constantly add photos, Immich may be something for you. Otherwise, onedrive, google photo etc are your friend for these.\n\nSince you already have a whopping 24TB at hand, I'd buy another one and spin up a TrueNAS, OMV or unraid. You can run \\*arrs on there quiet easily. TrueNAS core only supports BSD Jails, so take this with a grain of salt :D It works, but it's not as fancy as with docker. I'd go with unraid, since you can just add any drives you want. As you mentioned, redundancy for pirated media is not worth the cost. Unless you run a private netflix for paying users, but few do that :D You can always redownload.",

I don't use anything until I look at the code myself and understand it and to be blunt, I don't really care if it uses 'AI' so long as it make sense and works.\n\nSince it will inevitably be asked, yes I do use LLMs. Mostly in private, hobby projects, but I have used it to write documentation for professional work and I have occasionally used it non-agentically to ask questions. My private usage is documentation, testing, frontend work (I'm a backend dev), and bells and whistles (ie. non-core functionality, like in a todo list app, adding email reminders). LLMs are a tool and resisting/rejecting a new tool just makes you a worse craftsman.\n\nIn terms of my other personal views, AI doesn't exist at the moment. LLMs were rebranded as AI to lure in investors and suckers and what is actually AI was rebranded as AGI. LLMs can be tremendously useful for a wide variety of use cases and vastly lower barriers to entry in multiple industries. The environmental and societal impacts of LLMs are hugely detrimental and frankly the whole technology should be abandoned until advances in power generation, storage, and transmission as well as government regulation make them palatable and worthwhile for society as a whole.\n\nThat said, we all know they aren't going away. There is too much money to be made, either legitimately or through grifting. The 'AI' bubble will burst, but it will be like the dotcom burst. 'AI' will be concentrated in a couple companies that made the right/lucky decisions during the pop. 'AI' will become ubiquitous, but the rampant spending and marketing will ramp down. It will just become a part of life. Raging at the sky on a subreddit might feel good, but it will change nothing. Banning 'vibe' coded apps except on Fridays is a half measure that doesn't really solve anything. In a year or two, if not already, nearly everything in tech will have AI in the development toolchain at some point.\n\nOn a more sinister note, LLMs are improving at rates that are faster than communities can adapt. Some of the earliest hallmarks of 'AI' development, like emdashes and overusing emojis or overly commented code, have already been rectified in some models or by user instructions. We are already at a weird point where something like extensive documentation, which is a good practice, points to the app being 'vibed' because no human would do that. The hallmarks of 'AI' assisted or 'vibe' coding are rapidly approaching the point where it will be indistinguishable from human written code. The only way to determine if something is 'vibe' coded will be to use 'AI' itself. Either that or have codebases completely code reviewed by highly trained developers. This will burn mods out.\n\nLLMs are the Eternal September of the selfhosted community and development in general. Banning them completely is what I'd want, but it won't work because it is unsustainable. Vibe Code Friday only works based on the goodwill of the parties you are trying to stop and if they want to, they can adapt quicker and make it more difficult to determine 'AI' usage. For the mod's sanity, you are better off leaving them unbanned completely and crowdsourcing the determination of whether something is 'vibe' coded to community voting. In a year or two, when nearly everything has 'AI', either you'll need to either allow them all the time or the subreddit will start to die and something like /r/realselfhosted will pop up.",

Moreover we also have added Podman Quadlet support. Thank you!  \nThe new updated version is: **v1.16.1**\n\nHello everyone!\n\nOver the past \\~10 days, there have been no new updates or fixes pushed to the repository. This pause was unintentional and caused by an ongoing issue with a lost Docker account that we’ve been waiting on Docker to resolve.\n\nUnfortunately, despite multiple follow ups, the only response I’ve received so far is that there is “no update yet.” The prolonged uncertainty has been frustrating and has started to block our release and CI workflows.\n\nTo avoid further delays, I’ve decided to move forward by switching to a new official Docker account starting tomorrow. The previously referenced Docker account should be considered deprecated going forward.\n\nOnce the new account is live, normal development, updates, and releases will resume as usual.\n\nAlso I am very grateful to the community for your patience and support, especially for choosing trust and understanding instead of frustration during this, which would have also been justified given the situation. It truly means a lot and motivates me to keep moving forward.. I will keep this thread updated once everything is setup",

We were basically forced into supporting DockerHub because some NAS devices make it difficult to get containers from any other non-DockerHub source.\n\nWith that said, we basically treat DockerHub like a second class citizen as we only publish the nightly and actual releases, not the branch level super up to date releases due to rate limit issues. The rate limit issues are also why we clone various docker build components needed by the CI/CD process to GHCR.\n\nThere are unfortunately still reasons to publish to DockerHub (even if it is a PITA for us maintainers)",

The last one is the most expensive because it's a fresher Xeon CPU and I wanted to spend some money to have ECC memory. But if I buy some generic HP EliteDesk or Fujitsu, it again would cost me around €50. Not to mention, that if I had a shortage in money. I could get by with my very first machine alone just fine. \n\nAnd about time, I have a very young daughter additionally to a full time job, and I do not have an infinite amount of time to tinker with my lab. Hence, I treat my HomeLab as a Production environment and rarely spend time on it unless necessary. I touch it only if I want to update some of my apps or add a new one (which doesn't happen often).",

The self-hosted community played a big role in shaping where the project is today.\n\nIf you’ve been running Booklore and finding it useful, I’d really appreciate a ⭐ on GitHub, let’s see if we can push it to **10k stars** as a 1-year milestone.\n\n**v1.18.x highlights**\n\nThis release marks one of the biggest steps forward so far:\n\n* **New ebook reader (Foliate.js** based\\*\\*)\\*\\* Clean, responsive reader with support for EPUB, AZW3, MOBI, and FB2, plus highlights, notes, and bookmarks.\n* **Streaming ebook reading (beta)** Large ebooks (cookbooks, textbooks, etc.) can now be streamed page-by-page instead of loading the entire file.\n* **Optimized PDF & CBZ streaming** PDFs and CBZ/CBX files stream pages directly without full extraction, much faster for large files.\n* **Progressive Web App (PWA) support** Install Booklore as a PWA for a cleaner, app-like reading experience.\n\nMore improvements are already in progress, but I wanted to mark the **1-year point**, share the latest release, and say thanks again to everyone running Booklore at home.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Website: [https://booklore.org](https://booklore.org)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/booklore-app/booklore](https://github.com/booklore-app/booklore)\n* Demo: [https://demo.booklore.org](https://demo.booklore.org) (username: booklore | password: 9HC20PGGfitvWaZ1)\n* Discord: [https://discord.com/invite/Ee5hd458Uz](https://discord.com/invite/Ee5hd458Uz)\n* Support via Open Collective: [https://opencollective.com/booklore](https://opencollective.com/booklore)\n\nFeedback (and stars 😉) always welcome.",

I'm surprised I don't see it mentioned often on here. \n\nFor those that don't know, Storyteller creates epub 3 files (.epub) that syncs your drm-free audiobooks and ebooks. You can listen and read along at the same time as it highlights each sentence. You can listen as an audiobook or read as an ebook and wherever you leave off is synced to the other. It's essentially Amazon's whispersync but for your own files. \n\nThere's 2 parts - the self hosted server you upload your drm-free ebooks and audiobooks to. It then creates a new epub 3 file (.epub) that has both the audio and ebook in one. You can then open that file in the Storyteller Android or iPhone app. There's other apps out there that can read these files with both audiobook and ebook but I've found the Android Storyteller app has worked the best for me. I also like it since when I'm home, it'll connect to the server so I can see my entire library and can download new epub 3's I've already created without switching apps. \n\nI could never find where I left off when doing audiobooks and ebooks but this solves that problem for me. I have ADHD so I can sometimes struggle to sit down and read for long periods but I've found that listening to the audiobook while I read is a game changer. \n\nCurrently read and listen on my phone but am considering something like a Boox Palma which is an ereader but also runs Android.",

I remember that when I did some quick research on them, those files weren't popular, even though they have been around for over a decade. Also, I got the idea that it was some sort of \"smart packaging\" (like a website) because it let you embed video in addition to audio.\n\nBut are you saying that the server takes care of that syncing for you? How well does it handle that? Because I think the main problem was that audio versions are not 1-to-1 with the text versions. For example, not including \"he said\" or \"she responded,\" given that they sometimes have dramatization and different voice castings, etc.\n\nI will try it, though, if you say that it actually works.",

Some notes at the top:\n\n* We know that the web UI is pretty clunky. u/Tommerd and some other collaborators are working on a significant revamp that I think folks are going to be really happy with!\n* There have been some stability issues with the new mobile apps since they were released. I'm working hard on fixes right now, and feeling pretty confident that they'll be in a much better place in the next few weeks. There are some background audio player issues that should be resolved in the next few days, and some performance issues that affect folks with really large libraries that should be resolved in the next week or two.\n* There is a third party app that can sync with ABS and KOSync, but we're also hoping to add those natively to Storyteller by the end of the year\n* We're working on auto-ingestion of metadata from Hardcover!\n\nI'm also seeing a lot of folks talk about having large pre-existing libraries that don't conform to Storyteller's requirements for auto ingestion! That sucks, I'd like to make that better. The reason that Storyteller has these requirements (a single folder for all of the files in a given book) is that:\n\n* Auto-matching on names seemed error prone and frustrating\n* Audiobooks are sometimes multiple files\n\nIf anyone wants to brainstorm some ways to work through these challenges and make auto-ingestion easier for folks that have separate audiobook and ebook directories, let's do it!",

That's not a common outcome, but it does sound like you started with one of the more challenging cases haha.\n\n\nIt doesn't rely on fully matched sentences, all of the matching uses a levenshtein distance-based fuzzy matching algorithm. We use a scanning window to find groups of sentences that match with some threshold.\n\n\nIf you got very bad results, the two likely culprits are:\n\n\n1. The translations are just too different for Storyteller's heuristics to effectively match\n2. The transcription wasn't good enough\n\n\nYou can check if it was #2 by taking a look at the transcriptions in the `/data/assets` directory for your book. Just do some spot checks and see if they line up with your audio. If it has a lot of mistakes, you can almost always improve the transcription quite a bit by increasing the model — the default `tiny` is usually good enough for English language, but if you've got a bunch of non-English terms in there, you may do better with `large-v3-turbo`.\n\n\nNot in any way trying to brush this off, because there are some pathological cases that the alignment algorithm doesn't handle well that we'd like to improve, but there are also users with thousands of books in their libraries that have all been aligned more or less successfully, so I don't think you had a representative experience here!\n\n\nI will say though, Storyteller definitely expects both the text and the audio to be based on the same text. It has to account for differences in spelling, phrasing, etc because of transcription flaws, differing narration word choices, and skipped or additional sections in the narration (like image captions), but it also can't be _too_ lenient or you start just getting bad matches. So it's possible that it just won't be able to handle this particular match — you may need to find the text version of the particular translation used for the audiobook!\n\n\nAnyway, sorry it didn't work on the very first book you tried, that sucks. Hopefully increasing the model size helps, but I might try a different book out, or see if you can find the text of the translation for your audiobook (or vice versa!). ",

No company accidentally making money training vision models on your video. \n\nJust, for the love of god, don’t forward your admin port to the internet when there’s an authentication port meant for that. \n\nEdit: One drawback to self hosting your NVR is the whole “watch your cameras from outside your home” thing becomes your problem. The easiest and absolutely worst way to do this is to go into your router and forward the NVR’s or IP camera’s admin port to the internet. Sure, you can now see your cameras from outside your home, but so can everyone else. Some NVRs don’t have the admin port behind any default user/password authentication to make it easier inside your network. They have dedicated ports which have authentication built in. \n\nSo how do you do it? You can forward the authentication port so Joe Blow only sees a login page. (I dont like this one as you’re connecting directly to your public IP.) Or you can put your NVR behind a reverse proxy and add an authentication layer yourself with something like Authelia or Authentik which also sends Joe Blow to a login page. A reverse proxy can also support other helpful stuff like blocking IPs from certain geographic areas and known malicious IPs. It cuts down on pings from Russia, for example. Also also a reverse proxy uses a domain which you host through Cloudflare or someone else which means you can piggyback off their own security features. \n\nEdit 2: A lot of great discussion around a third option of setting up a VPN, whether it’s a true VPN or something like Tailscale. This is a great option. The only downside is if you have non-techy people accessing it. They’ll forget to turn on Tailscale or the VPN on their phone before accessing it and then you’re getting messages about not being able to connect. The reverse proxy means it looks like a regular webpage login which everyone is familiar with. ",

Why are businesses interested in making their product compatible with third party, independent services? How hard is usually to \"hack\" said products if they are indeed closed?\n\nIn other words, what's the research one has to take to decide which product they can buy with certainty it will work as intended without the proprietary SAAS? Is it like... brand oriented? Or there could be specific products in a compatible brand that are actually locked  down?\n\nMy questions would seem ignorant and ridiculous, but I do not know much about domotics and the protocols behind it. I only know that AWS goes down, your bed will keep burning. I dream of a house where I can buy stuff in my local hardware shop, of known and well established brands (ABB, Bticino, etc) and make them work on my local network. How naive is that?",

                  "text": "I think I understand your question and you’ve probably not gotten a straight answer because “it depends”. They (HomeAssistant) have worked really hard to support many brands and products. There’s a few angles you can look at this: Natively supported integrations in HomeAssistant (cloud Or local) or HomeAssistant Community Store (HACS) where the community has built a tool to connect to a certain brand or product. Varying levels of supported products in both. There’s also the “Works with Home Assistant” program with different rankings of how well a product works with HomeAssistant that is getting more popular as a label on some products.       As far as how to pick going forward, you need to research the product but more so you need to know the technology. Local only protocols such as Zigbee, Zwave, Thread, HomeKit, Matter, and local IP are the most sure fire way to identify products that will work without the SaaS layer behind it because they never leave your network. For instance, Philips Hue light bulbs don’t mention HomeAssistant on their box, sells their own hub, and otherwise doesn’t mention HA - but many of their bulb boxes have the Zigbee wireless protocol logo which means you can pair it to HA via Zigbee without so much as a Philips Hue Account.     Overall market coverage is really good for a lot of the products, but you’ve gotta kind of accept the sliding scale of ability to use in HA or how far you’ll go to integrate it. Wyze cameras are an example of a product that sells a subscription and service but with some effort you can use the cameras in HA with better features and quality than what the company offers.  Some brands are actively moving away from 3rd party integrations, the big one that bit me was Chamberlain / Liftmaster MyQ that removed their API and have started locking down their buttons to not be easily circumvented by blaQ or ratgdo.   A lot of text, happy to answer more. I’m a huge HA fan and have a series on YouTube on how to install it and set up certain tools and automations.",

Some brands, given the popularity of HA, do maintain their own integrations for their products. For the ones that don't, unless you are among the first couple docens owners of a specific device, chances are there's already an undergrad student from the Philippines that has reverse-engineered the API of your specific, say, smart air-freshener, and he has created an integration for it.\n\nI'd go as far as saying that home assistant supports at least an order of magnitude more devices than anything else under the sun. Even makers that actively try to prevent users to reverse engineer their APIs often loose the battle.",

                  "text": "Here's an example. I finally had my first device made useless because they shut down a cloud service:  a handful of smart outlets. They did say HomeKit would still work if you linked it to that, but you had to do the link before they took down the cloud service (because they needed the service to generate HomeKit codes). I was struggling with this and doing a bunch of research until I discovered that I didn't need the cloud service at all. It turns out years ago somebody made a Python library called PyWeMo that does full local control, including discovery. No cloud service required. That's what Home Assistant uses. So I'm totally unaffected.\n\nIn general, I think Home Assistant support is going to be equivalent or better to any of the proprietary ones (HomeKit, Alexa, Google Home). Partly this is because there's a HomeKit interface so all your HomeKit devices will just show up in HA. But partially this is because smart home manufacturers \\*want\\* their stuff to plug into the proprietary things. And I suspect the HA devs are very good at figuring out how to use the same APIs. All my basic lights, sensors, and doors work just fine. (Although I can believe that atypically automated things like robot vacuums and cameras are harder). And HA even found a bunch of stuff I didn't expect like my printer, my Roku, and my humidifier.\n\nBut this is probably a hard question to answer because I'd guess most people who are running their own Home Assistant don't run that many devices requiring cloud connections or proprietary services. Most of their devices are Zigbee and/or Z-Wave; those don't need much if any support from the manufacturer.",

So if I am asking Claude to update a docker container/compose file, making an update to an LXC/VM, whatever, at the end of the session it will summarize the changes, determine if it's worth it/important enough to add to a running homelab-doc, and if it is, it'll create a commit with the explanation of changes and submit a PR for me to manually review.  Then I merge the PR in.\n\nNext time around, I tell Claude to read my homelab-doc repo and it has all the context it needs.",

I haven't touched mine in years. The last time was due to a security vulnerability in the software I was using, although the issue didn't relate to my configuration.\n\nIP reputation plays a big role. If your address is flagged as being within a residential range or you're hosting on a cheap VPS environment along with bad actors, you will struggle to get e-mail delivered. On the other hand, if you have a good ISP that caters to more advanced users or business customers, you shouldn't have a lot of trouble. E.g. I changed ISP recently and found the IP range was listed incorrectly in Spamhaus. It wasn't a major issue as my domains have good reputation, but I contact them and they had it corrected quickly.\n\nI think user expectation plays a role in the perception of e-mail hosting being difficult. I don't run \\_any\\_ spam filters, because I don't trust them (I wrote statistical spam filters in my first job). You will never win if you want to stop all spam, but keep in mind that while GMail and Outlook may stop more spam (with a large degree of arrogance IMO), they will also block more legitimate e-mail in doing so.",

                  "text": "Good news! Your patch fixes the bug. Stingray now start the way it should and shows a proper home screen.\n\nI played with the app and noticed it has real value over existing applications like Swiftfin (my current default Jellyfin client on AppleTV) and Infuse (only use it for the handy built in subtitle down loader, otherwise it nags about paying a monthly fee).In Stingray I like the fact that libraries are in the top menu. Also, browsing shows is very good and having a \"restart\" and \"resume\" button on played shows comes in handy. Once playing, I like the episode selector, audio track selector and even picture-in-picture option.\n\nHowever, it only seems to work well with tv-shows. Here are some of my findings:\n\n\\- When selecting the \"root\" menu from the tabs in the top of the screen and selecting \"root\", I get a small black spinner on a dark blue background that never stops. Back button doesn't work. Only restarting the app gets me back to the home screen\n\n\\- Whenever I select a movie from the home screen, I often get an error saying \"Media not found\". Later more movies played properly. Perhaps the server and client need to synchronize and I am too eager to start? The big posters when selecting a movie are beautiful! However, the black text is not always readable over the movie poster.\n\n\\- The \"Movies\" tab shows me only 1 movie. It is a very old .AVI with no spaces or other special character in the filename. Perhaps the oldest file on the server? It plays properly when selected.\n\n\\- Supporting music might be the biggest value over the other Jellyfin apps, as they can't do it. However, currently music seems to be a problem. My music appears with shows and movies on the home page. When I select an album it doesn't play (\"No media found, it may not have been compatible with Stingray\"). The \"Music\" tab is empty (\"this library appears to be empty\"), even though my music is correctly shown on the home screen. The playlists tab displays a big read error message: \"Unable to decode JSON from... \\[my server\\]. The operation couldn't be completed (Stingray.MediaType.InitError.error(0)\". I tried mp3 and flac files, both are not accepted / found outside the home page. Perhaps I need to wait for everything to be synchronized just like I needed to do with movies?\n\nBy the way, the black error messages on a dark blue background are hard to read.\n\nOtherwise: still a great start and a promising new app to play Jellyfin media! Keep up the good work!\n\nIn case it helps: the home screen mentions Stingray v1.01, Jellyfin server 10.11.6, tvOS 26.2.0",

Just sometimes you need to build your own thing.\n\nFor example, I personally have the mindset and philosophy of going as barebones as possible in dependencies, like 3rd party imported libraries. While sometimes they are fine, often they are some FOTM iteration and a big moving target that forces you to lockin build versions and even worse, have to double check new releases because so much contributor vibe coded slop these days is wrecking various dependencies (not always with good teams but often) and will break your project. Not relying on 3rd party stuff means less pitfalls down the road. Even if all of those are stable, it's sometimes just personal preference to want to control the code bloat of dependencies.\n\nI don't know OP's reasoning for this, but often it's also just a choice of preferring to work in their own dev environment and software architecture design than be forced to learn the many dependencies of an existing project.\n\nOther times it is about control over the project. They want to release something better, or not even better, just different to their own preference. Software devs are notoriously ego maniacs and can be challenging to collaborate with. Probably not the case here if you say they are anxious for additional support, but you open yourself to the risk of putting in a bunch of effort into a project that might not be appreciated and you don't know the owner of the project, so it's just easier to avoid and build your own thing.\n\nAnd sometimes it is just purely a project for yourself because you want to learn how to do something yourself too, which is how most of my projects are. I could just fork something and add to it, send my pull request, but I'd really like to build a project from scratch in that tech stack to really get to learn it.",

So we have the complexity of a stable project, without it being stable. Now Stingray's far from perfect, it *just* v1.0.0 (I haven't even put it in the release page yet because Apple only just approved it), and people are already reporting crashes, which sucks!

              "text": "Indeed the Apple TV does have issues with encoding since it's just not built for it. Encoding on an Apple TV can be problematic because Apple runs these TVs hot. Like really hot. While I'm testing, I have yet to see my Apple TV drop down from a serious thermal state. Not to mention, I don't think they have much for hardware encoders on them to begin with. With that in mind, Stingray relies on the server to do transcoding since Jellyfin already has a great setup for it over the API. This helps with performance, thermals, storage, and memory. The current generation of Apple TVs only have about 4GB of memory available (according to Xcode), and a good 1.2GB or so is typically tied up with \"Other Processes\".",

My biggest issue with Swiftfin is that it doesn’t see my music, I'm really glad yours works work with music.\n\nJust a question, as a total noob when it comes to codecs, when I play pretty much anything from my library via Swiftfin, I see in the Jellyfin control panel that it is using direct play, because the client is fully compatible with the file. I like seeing that, because my server is pretty weak so I like not having to do any kind of live transcoding. However, with Stingray, everything in my library says that it’s being transcoded. Does this mean Swiftfin has better compatibility/supports more codecs than Stingray? Do you have plans to bring that support up to Swiftfin's level?",

But if my email server ever went down, I would not do it again. Too much work.

If so, then your records must be in perfect working order.\n\nAnd if the server IP you are using happens to be on any spam blocklists like Spamhaus, you're in for a difficult ride. Or if you're trying to host email from a home ISP, which blocks certain ports like 25.\n\nLike I said, it was a good learning experience to understand the process and how it all works. But to do it just to get email? No. No way.\n\nMine is still working to this day, and I'm in good standing with the spam companies, and I can send/receive to or from any service.

They were finding loopholes and creative ways to do that back when we had the rule of law. Now we don't, do you really think they aren't going to just do whatever they want with that data regardless of what the law says now? They will vacuum that up in mass to find people to target. Granted I'm not going to use email for anything where security is critical because it's not secure even in my home. Even the mundane stuff has value we've not considered though. My email is also my shared contacts, calendars, tasks....\n\nI self host file syncing services for exactly the same reason. I don't do social media, reuse usernames/passwords, post anything potentially self identifying. I don't have camera's at my house that send anything to the cloud.

I’m happy with the music streaming service I use, the price seems fair, and I get all the music I want to listen to in a single service. Very much like streaming was for years before I started uh… obtaining my TV/Movies elsewhere. \n\n2. E-Mail. Just not worth the headache. \n\n3. Password manager. Too high risk. Plus it gives me a completely separate source of environment variables combined with a private GitHub repository for everything. This creates paranoid levels of separation where both services are needed to re-create my homelab services. But it can still be done with minimal effort if I had a catastrophic failure that necessitated a clean new install of everything. \n\n4. VPN. I could pay for a cheap VPS and run headcale or wireguard. But Tailscale is free and works great. There are solid arguments for self hosting here. But for me, homelab services are all about either saving money, or doing things that cannot practically be done with cloud services. I’m not actually someone who is “opposed” to the cloud. I just don’t want to pay for services that don’t give me value commensurate with the price. So this is an area where Tailscale works just fine so there’s no advantage *for me* to host on my own. Similarly I use another VPN provider to watch blacked out live sports. \n\n5. Cloud storage. I definitely have storage IN my homelab but I pay for cloud storage for an off-site backup rather than hosting my own offsite backup in some other location. I pay for both a bulk storage provider for backups, and iCloud. I absolutely could cut out iCloud and use something like Immich, but it’s $3/mo and super convenient.",

There's just no real advantage of it, for me and my use case, over just using tailscale. Which I have used for a number of years now, haven't paid a dime for; and frankly don't need to touch beyond initial setup on a new machine.\n\nI especially love the subnet router feature. I mean it's practically a single line command on a Raspberry Pi Zero in my RV so that I can access that entire network (including a miniPC and some other components there, too) from my house if things are misbehaving. Yes, that can absolutely be done self-hosted. But why? What's the advantage for me? What's the benefit for me? I haven't come up with one. \n\nIt's basically a \"Why did you do less work when more work was an option?\" question for me.",

A handful of samba shares for various things beyond just media. Photography is a hobby of mine and I use Lightroom for editing. Lightroom has a neat feature where it creates local proxies of files you're editing; so I have that on a local nVME drive but store all of the actual raw photos on a spinning drive ZFS pool.\n\nAnd then there's a few things I've built myself. For example, I live a couple of miles from a theme park that I visit often. But I can literally see it from my house, I can go anytime I want, there's no reason to go when there's a crowd there. There are tools like Queue-times to estimate wait times but it's not very precise. Turns out the parks radio dispatcher transmits their actual attendance numbers once per hour over their two-way radio system. So I setup an SDR and have faster-whisper running in a container to transcribe it, PostgreSQL database setup to store all of those transcriptions, and some scripts in Python to parse the actual attendance counts all so that I can just look at my phone real quick and see if it's busy or not. But with actual numbers. (I'll be the first to admit; that's next to useless. It's more that I wanted to tinker and figure it out.)",

Not that it's particularly difficult, but you don't really gain much by doing it yourself.\n\nEDIT - since we are talking about self-hosting, I'm referring to authoritative DNS, i.e. telling the outside world where your domains are and what machines to use as mail exchanges. I'm not talking about non-authoritative DNS only used for your own clients, e.g. PiHole. It used to be necessary to run your own authoritative DNS to get some types of DNS which the registrar or ISP would not offer, e.g. AAAA, SPF. These days either they are well supported, or the standards have specified ways to encode the information in TXT records. Since you still need to go to the ISP to get rDNS, it's usually easier to get them to do the whole job.",

Spotify pays artists so poorly that I know several bands who have openly stated they would rather people just pirate their music than use Spotify.  That's not to mention, of course, that music also regularly gets removed from Spotify, so you can't rely on anything being on there long-term.\n\nThe answer, as other people have mentioned, is e-mail.

For most people that's a totally reasonable compromise — you get the privacy of not having Google reading your inbox while still having reliable delivery.\n\nI run mailcow with a relay for outbound and it's been rock solid.

Plexamp is awesome. I also kind of \\_like\\_ how this way of cataloguing music enocurages me to listen to full albums again, I forgot how much I liked that when I was younger. I'm also excited to go and browse discs at my local music store again. If I spend 13$ on used discs per month at that store I'll build a respectable collection of music of time and that's 13$ not going to a megacorp that actively supports executives that also run military industrial complex-feeding companies around the world.",

The sweet spot IMO is owning a custom domain for your email and using imap so you have a local backup of your mail.\n\nThe main thing with email is that it’s a two party system, and whoever is hosting email for your correspondents will see the messages, so the privacy angle is much lower than other services. At the same time, spam filters perform better with more data, and deliverability will be more reliable with a major host (yes, there are things you can do to mitigate most deliverability issues so for a lot of people this might not be a huge factor, but if it matters it always favors the existing providers). If you own your domain you minimize the risk of platform fuckery because you can just point your mx record at a different host.\n\nSecurity is a factor too. A lot of big platforms are terrible at privacy but good at security, and far too many services have zero safeguards if your email address is compromised.\n\nOverall: self hosting email is technically feasible, moderately risky, and has very low to negative ROI so it’s not really worth it.",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nOne year ago, in January 2025, we unleashed the very first beta of Pangolin and today, we are thrilled to release Pangolin 1.15.0. This update officially takes Private Access out of beta and introduces some heavy hitters: iOS and Android apps, device fingerprinting, posture tracking, and more. We can't believe it has been 1 year!\n\nFor those who don’t know, Pangolin is an identity-aware VPN and proxy for remote access to anything, anywhere. It’s like an open-source alternative to Cloudflare Tunnels and Twingate.\n\n* Github: [https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin](https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin)\n* Blog and video: [https://pangolin.net/blog/posts/1-15-0-release](https://pangolin.net/blog/posts/1-15-0-release)\n\n# iOS/iPadOS and Android\n\n[iOS app screenshots](https://preview.redd.it/b4mzuhswo5fg1.png?width=3780&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d8ca4c9dbdc269d445de495e210ca090f83990)\n\nDeveloping for mobile is a journey through the seven circles of... well, let’s just call it \"challenging.\" Beyond the technical hurdles, there’s the arduous dance with Apple and Google to get through the App Store gates.\n\nAfter weeks of refreshing our developer dashboards, the wait is over. You can now take your zero-trust network on the road:\n\n* **iPhone and iPad**: Download on the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/kz/app/pangolin-client/id6757407406).\n* **Android**: Download on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.pangolin.Pangolin).\n\n# Device Fingerprint and Posture Collection\n\n[Screenshot of dashboard showing device fingerprint and posture info with pending approval](https://preview.redd.it/vecygwt6m5fg1.png?width=4520&format=png&auto=webp&s=6eecc6978a27650ce0ce694d8f9a0ec442a5bc79)\n\nLong-time users likely remember Olm, our Go-based client (named after the small, cave-dwelling salamander). Olm is the workhorse under the hood, handling all of the networking like holepunching and NAT traversal to websocket enforcement.\n\nWe architected Olm to be as headless and portable as possible, which allowed us to use it as the \"brain\" for all of our clients across Mac, Windows, Linux, and iOS and Android. In addition to the Olm core, now each client can collect specific device data.\n\n**What is fingerprinting?** It’s like a digital ID card for your hardware. We collect identifying info like serial numbers, OS versions, and hostnames. This helps you distinguish between \"My Work Laptop\" and \"My 4th Replacement Laptop,\" and it ensures that if you block a device, it stays blocked.\n\nWhat are posture checks? Fingerprinting tells us who the device is; posture checks tell us if the device is healthy. We look for security vitals like: Disk encryption status, firewall status, and antivirus activity.\n\n# Device Approvals\n\n[Screenshot of dashboard showing pending device approvals feed](https://preview.redd.it/kp6cm5zbm5fg1.png?width=4524&format=png&auto=webp&s=601f22bf7a68a5777ac0631d5c3c515892882af2)\n\nPreviously by default, a user could connect any number of devices as long as they could log in with an approved account. With version 1.15, we are extending zero-trust to the hardware layer by introducing Device Approvals.\n\nWhen enabled on a user’s role, Pangolin shifts to a \"deny by default\" stance for new hardware. Even with valid credentials, a new device is entirely blocked until an admin decisively approves the connection. We’ve also added an Approvals Feed to the sidebar where you can see a running log of pending requests. \n\n# Device Blocking and Archiving\n\nHave a device that’s gone rogue or been lost? You can now officially Block it via the Action Menu (three dots). This moves the device to a restricted list and kills its access immediately.\n\nYou’ll also notice you can’t \"delete\" a device; you can only Archive it so that Pangolin can keep a permanent record of every device that has touched your resources.\n\n# Give it a try!\n\n* Try for for free on [Pangolin Cloud](https://app.pangolin.net/auth/login). \n* Self-host the [Open Source Community or Enterprise Editions](https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin).\n* You can dive into the details in the [Official Documentation](https://docs.pangolin.net).",

I currently run a wireguard vpn on my devices when out of my LAN on my router.  When I activate Pangolin for a private resource it kills my VPN for my LAN access.  Can I add my LAN to the private network to only need the Pangolin VPN?  A few issues that I see though with this is that my VPS is limited to 2000 GB a month so I don't want to route all my traffic through my VPS to get to my LAN.  Also, if Im at home on my LAN it doesnt make sense to have the VPN active but I would still need it for access to the private resource.  Part of the issue is that my home internet only gets 40 mb upload so always running my VPN is quite a bottleneck.",

I also like that it's packaged in the repos for most Linux distros although that's something I can live without.\n\nWould there be any interest in incorporating something like this? Pangolin seems great as an all in one solution but the downside there is that it means there's a single point of attack and being able to have a certificate type setup where nodes can validate each other using some method that's independent of the control plane would be very nice to have.",

I think it's just because it cuts out the cloud middle-man where the web interface runs. Or something like that.\n\nWhen I arrive home, my GPS location triggers my lights to come onto 1%. When I walk in, a motion detector brings them to 30% and resumes the music grouped across the home (at an appropriate volume as determined by time of day). Doing this in HomeKit required a paid 3rd party app and some dirty dirty workarounds. Everything I needed to do this in Home Assistant was there native.

          "text": "As many others have mentioned Home Assistant.\n\nBut more to the point - as soon as you want anything to be tied together. So many services either don't provide APIs, or have shuttered/heavily restricted APIs which they used to have.\n\nThat means if you want to use them you have to leverage backdoors (like reverse engineered APIs) instead of official methods to do something (e.g. download an original activity file from Strava) or everything (download anything from Garmin Connect), and even then that might not be possible.\n\nAs soon as you need to have anything linked together it becomes a delicate stack of cards that's prone to braking at any moment and often seems to be impossible.  Self Hosted isn't perfect, but usually has good enough APIs to support you doing what the hell you want, or simply just picks up changes you make to files/sidecar files anyway (and allows you to directly access those files).\n\nOne example in my stack is the simple operation of Geotagging photos taken on my DSL and uploading to Google Photos.  Without a self hosted stack this would be impossible - Google haven't seen fit to allow externally taken photos to be a) uploaded easily, b) tagged with locations from Google Timeline & Google Health activities. (Let alone anything more exotic like blending Google Timeline with Garmin Connect to improve accuracy).\n\nWith self hosting that functionality has been possible, where all the sketchy limitations come down to the reliance on third parties (oh how I wish Garmin Connect allowed watches/Bike Computers to directly upload to S3-Compatible/Box/Google Drive/OneDrive/SFTP type storage).\n\nFirstly is a self written and hosted platform similar to Dawarich that takes the location data from my phone via Home Assistant (the latter calls a webhook) every 30 seconds/change; imports activities from Garmin Connect (via garmin\\_export, triggered by Home Assistant webhooks in response to Garmin Connect app notifications); and imports GPS Logger logs (car, transit, taxi) - uploaded by Folder Sync which also triggers a webhook to scan.\n\nI call this Dawarich like platform Sainz as that's the VMs name and I'm rubbish at naming stuff - it's not actually Dawarich as it started as a logger for Transit trips and snowballed from their such it now includes location tracking from Forza Horizon too.\n\nThis means I have a record of accurate (GPS Logger, Garmin) and approx. (Home Assistant App) coordinates for where I've been.\n\nSo when I go out with my DSLR, which is usually on a walk being recorded on my watch, I will already have all the locations recorded in a database by the end of the day when I get home/to the hotel.\n\nI am then able to :-\n\n1. Insert Memory Card into Tablet and open Folder Sync - copies photos to my tablet (1st Backup).\n2. A second Folder Sync pair then copies these to my NAS (and when done triggers a webhook on Sainz) - (2nd Backup) which can often take all night and longer\n3. Once those photos are uploaded the webhook it triggers scans for all the files in that scratch folder and logs to a database.\n4. Both 3. and the Activities uploads tasks queue another task to scan photos - all photos with no tagged geodata that have a location recorded within 5 seconds get written to a library folder used by PhotoPrism and then tagged with the Geolocation data (those without any Geolocation are copied anyway).  If the file is over two weeks old it falls back on the Home Assistant App location data if it's within 30 seconds (the two weeks wait is to allow me time to fix garmin\\_export issues which happen while on holiday).\n5. This triggers a library scan in PhotoPrism to pickup all the new photos\n6. Then triggers another task which uploads all GeoTagged photos to Google Photos (using rclone) and to my backup cloud storage (3rd Backup - again using rclone).  The Google Photos limitation is because you can't delete/amend/modify previously uploaded photos using their pathetic API.\n7. I also have a script which writes the PhotoPrism changes (Titles and Descriptions) back to the files, which thanks to using Rclone means those get backed up to the original photo on my cloud storage.\n\nWith all this place it also means all my Forza Horizon screenshots (uploaded to One Drive by the Xbox and pulled down with Rclone) get tagged with their in game location (not that I'm actually doing that with anything yet)",

TLDR: keep a copy of your docker volume AND create a sqlite backup for good measure. \n\nPersonally I have 2 physical copies on an external disk of the whole docker folder i've set up, plus an encrypted offsite backup on a VPS. I should be golden with the 3-2-1 backup strategy rule. (Edit: oh, and I have borgbackup set up, so my backups are actually incremental, deduplicated and compressed. So I could easily roll back to a specific date in the event that my data has been corrupted (say, I get crypto'd))\n\nALSO, as you mentioned, password is rather critical, so I have a monthly calendar reminder where I manually export the Vaultwarden database (from the Web UI under Tools) in a JSON file, and here's the kicker: KeepassXC can create a new password vault USING Bitwarden's exported JSON. So I end up having a Nth backup methode of my main password vault as a good old kdbx file; I keep one copy on my cellphone for example.",

It isn't particularly like invidious, because it's a GUI for your videos that you yourself have downloaded on your machine as opposed to being an alternative GUI for other videos that live on YouTube.\n\nIt doesn't have a recommendation algorithm per se, but it does suggest similar videos based on keywords and tags, which are still available on YouTube but are hidden in the GUI. And it also has subtitle indexing which makes it easier to search for videos based on subtitles. And it has comment saving as well, though that isn't searchable. I actually find the comments much, much easier to search through since they're all loaded in at once on the one page.\n\nYou can set it up to either retain videos forever, which is what I do since I'm in it for the sake of archival and data hoarding. Or you can configure it to automatically delete videos you've watched X days after you watched them. And you also define what channels it should download videos from, how many videos it should download, if you do or do not want shorts/streams, and so on. Pretty much everything is configurable, as you'd probably expect from a foss project.\n\nAlthough it's not invidious at all, I thought I'd mention it because it kind of fits OPs question (I find it considerably more responsive than the laggy mess YouTube's desktop UI is), and in the long term, once I've hoarded enough videos, I plan to begin watching videos exclusively via TA and not on YouTube itself. Sadly I don't think I'll be able to entirely escape YouTube/google, because you do need to supply a cookie if you want to watch age restricted or members only videos (of you have a channel membership). But at least I'll get a say in how and what videos I want to watch\n\nThere's no algorithm though. It does have APIs, so I suppose there's nothing stopping you from making your own, maybe that's the sort of thing a small, locally hosted, AI model would be good for. But nobody has done anything like that as far as I'm aware (truthfully probably intentional - a lot of people want to get away from algorithms anyway)",

Context here matters, so I'll continue. \n\nYou go into features or experiences.\n\nBeing in control; in more ways than one.  My data, my rules. I don't have to worry about strangers (developers, maintainers, random contractors, 'advertising partners') slurping up my information, leaking sensitive information, or selling out to advertisers.  This is a big deal for me, as I've grown up relatively secure with the mindset that the internet is the wild-west and don't carelessly share things with internet strangers. Many of these big cloud services are nothing more than big strangers.\n\nCost savings.  This is hard to always quantify... but some things on the internet are simply too expensive to justify paying someone else to do it. Dropping $300-400CAD on a 'new' mini PC could theoretically pay itself back in less than a year depending on what you run.  Buying 'used' or repurposing old gear really only needs replacement parts and power to be considered... but I'll gladly 'waste' 10-20Watts hosting something myself.   \nThis holds true for me with storage as well... I could self-host 42TB at a rate of $5.16CAD/mo if I want it paid back in 12 months... I could triple this deployment and self-host mirrors at family/friend locations and pay it back over 3 years.\n\nWhere cloud providers excel (in my opinion) .. is where you either \\*can't\\*, or \\*don't\\* want to own your own hardware or service.. Short-term use items are perfect use-cases for cloud.  Use it, pay monthly for a bit, then walk away... be careful though... there's nothing more permanent than that which is supposed to be temporary.  \nEmail is one of those things that can technically be done, but the cloud giants have really made it difficult to do this without ending up on a dozen different block-lists.  Email is a tough one to justify either way... but it's becoming increasingly more important with the trends in the internet... verify your ID / age to participate in chat, social media, etc.. Combine this with the fact that many online services don't have proper sign-in authentication/security and heavily \\*rely\\* on email addresses to send you sign-in codes or magic links... loose your email for whatever reason and you loose more than access to some forums and a couple video games... even if you have credentials for sites, an increasing number will email you anyway when you attempt to sign-in.",

          "text": "At least to me it sounded like you're actually asking for two categories.  Self-hosted FOSS software that's better than proprietary competitors in terms of the quality of software...  And situations where even if it's the same software there's a tangible, non-philisophical, non-hypothetical benefit to self-hosting vs using the paid, external form of a service.\n\nFor me the real standout standout \"I wouldn't even bother with an external service, this is the only way this product works for me\" categories are having a good media server and good password manager.\n\nMedia server:  Selfhosting a media server cuts down on network load since all those bits are flying between server and client on a local network, vs everyone in your house streaming from the internet and clogging up your internet connection.  Plus self-hosted media servers are going to let you install whatever plugins you want for customizing what \\*you\\* want to use a media server for:  Listening to music on the bus or watching movies in 4K glory at home.  Won't inject ads at arbitrary, algorithmically determined but utterly stupid points in the show/movie the way some streaming services do.  Obviously when you compare vs a streaming service like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video there's a huge tradeoff in terms of library size and effort of library curation, but at the same time if the movie I want to watch is on my jellyfin server and on Amazon Prime Video.... Jellyfin is going to be the higher quality, no-ads experience.\n\nPassword manager:  I guess for me this is more about hypothetical situations and peace of mind and less about compared featureset, since I self-host vaultwarden and I could easily just replace it with a free tier bitwarden account with feature parity.  But over the past few years the number of data breaches of password managers has been *daunting*.  And I get that they store everything in encrypted blocks and yay for them, but those encrypted blocks are paired with email addresses that have probably lost a multitude of passwords in *other* data breaches available on the dark web.  I just don't even want to deal with any of this.  My vaultwarden instance and the  internet are completely unaware of eachother.  I tailscale in when I need to access it from the bitwarden app on my phone.  I'm not quite so naive as to think I've built an impenetrable fortress, as so many of those have been breached.  But I've at least raised the difficulty way past what breaching it would be worth, and for a password manager it needs to stay that way.",

Of course self hosting music streaming and subscribing to music streaming are drastically different when it comes to WHAT you listen to, but the fact that my self-hosted library is easier to navigate in an app that has better features than any of the paid ones blows not only my mind but the minds of lots of friends I show it to. And since I control what's on it, I can put my own band on it or anything else I record. I can rip demos and other stuff that local bands from my youth recorded and self-released in tiny quantities, which is a huge plus, because that stuff will never be on any streamer. I have explicit versions of albums that many streamers only have in radio or otherwise censored edits as well. So for me, self-hosting my music and rediscovering albums I bought as a teen is absolutely mind blowing.  \n\nI also love actually just having network shares, which isn't strictly in the same category as other \"proper\" sevices I have, but literally just having folders accessible from the phone, my PC, my laptop, my steam deck and being able to share files with family through a dedicated LAN share blows any cloud storage out of the water.",

      "text": "This little side project of mine launched all the way back in 2021, at the height of the pandemic, and while I counted it to good timing back then, it wouldn't have lasted this long if there wasn't a real need from the community.\n\nSince then, Reactive Resume has helped almost 1 million users create resumes, helped them get the careers they wanted and helped students jump-start their applications.\n\nThis new version has been in the making for months, I try to get time to work on it whenever there's a weekend, whenever I can physically pull an all-nighter after work. It's a culmination of everything I've learned over the years, fixing all the bugs and feature requests I've gotten through GitHub and my emails.\n\nFor those of you who are unaware of this project, and nor should you be, Reactive Resume is a **free and open-source** resume builder that focuses on completely free and untethered access to a tool most people need at some point in their life, without giving up your privacy and money. In a nutshell, it’s just a resume builder, nothing fancy, but no corners have been cut in providing the best user experience possible for the end user.\n\nHere are some features I thought were worth highlighting:\n\n* **Improved user experience,** now easier than ever to keep your resume up-to-date.\n* **Great for single page or multi-page resumes,** or even long-form PDFs.\n* **Easier self-hosting** with examples on how to set it up on your server.\n* **Immensely better documentation**, to help guide users on how to use the project.\n* There’s ***some*** **AI in there too**, where you bring your own key, no subscriptions or paywalls. There's also an **agent skill** for those who want to try it out on their own.\n* **Improved account security** using 2FA or Passkeys, also add your own SSO provider (no more SSO tax!).\n* **13 resume templates**, and many more to come. If you know React/Tailwind CSS, it’s very easy to build you own templates as well. Also **supports Custom CSS**, so you can make any template look exactly the way you like it to.\n* **Available in multiple languages**. If you know a second language and would love to help contribute translations, please head over to the docs to learn more.\n* **Did I mention it’s free?**\n\nI sincerely hope you enjoy using the brand new edition of Reactive Resume almost as much as I had fun building it.\n\n**If you have the time, please check out** [**rxresu.me**](https://rxresu.me)**.**  \n**I'd love to hear what you think ❤️**\n\nOr, if you’d like to know more about the app, head over to the docs at [docs.rxresu.me](https://docs.rxresu.me/)\n\nOr, if you’d like to take a peek at the code, the GitHub Repository is at [amruthpillai/reactive-resume](https://github.com/amruthpillai/reactive-resume).\n\n***Note:*** I do expect a lot of traffic on launch day and I don’t have the most powerful of servers, so if the app is slow or doesn’t load for you right now, please check back in later or the next day.",

I actually like doing bullets, 3 bullets...one to show strategic/critical thinking, one to highlight technical. One to highlight your ethos. \n\nBecause of the layout with 'skills' and 'experience' left justified you massively shrink the width of the area where you write your experience. Which means  it appears way longer than it is.\n\nYour skill section is wild. Like good on you for being familiar with such a broad tech stack, but it overwhelms. Unless they call our a specific technology you can cut tons out of this section. Example: Databases....then you list like a million flavors of SQL. You could simplify it to databases: sql/nosql/graph/whatever. Or even more. Just say database management.\n\nYour bullet points are also too wordy and contain lots unnecessary fluff that dilutes your message. You only include 'impact' as the last bullet when it should be in every bullet. None of it is really tangible...example:\n\n> Acted as a key full-time on-site technical resource, collaborating directly with Tier-1 consulting partners (\"Big 4\" and big consultancy companies) and the client's internal teams to align on solutions and accelerate project delivery.\n\nCan be simplified to:\n\n> Accelerated delivery by x% through technical and functional alignment between Big 4 partners and internal teams.\n\nCaptures hard value. Strips out the fluff. \n\nYour certificate section is kind of crazy. Listing 14 Salesforce certs? Don't do that. Just say something like:\n\n> Salesforce subject matter expert with 14 active certifications, encompassing the full technical stack.\n\nReally its not bad. You have the experience. Tighten it up and make it punchy. Get rid of some whitespace. \n\nMy 2c.",

Plus, having both classes of system around, they're *way* more compact than the SFF models which can only really fit 1-2 3.5 inch drives at best, taking up far more space than a 1L box and 2 external drives.",

For example if you want 4+ TB then it will be cheaper to get one 4 TB than one 4 TB SSD or two 2 TB SSD or four 1 TB SSD. \n\nExternal drives have a low risk of randomly disconnecting. Not sure how true it is nowadays (as it use to happen to me and I moved away from it) but the enclosure would get hot and the USB controller on the external hard drive would disconnect. \n\nHad a corruption because it occurred during a write operation and had to restore from a backup. \n\nPersonally I always recommend a SFF for a person not knowing what they are looking for (especially media) because most likely when they start out they just want to put large storage into a machine with no redundancy and HP eiltedesk SFF works great for that. \n\nThere are also a lot of post of people asking how to expand there storage after a few months of getting a miniPC.\n\nOf course it also depends on how much they cost in OP local market \n\nThanks for the comment/ discussion",

Just check with the following:\n\n1. 16 GB Ram is **more than enough**,\n2. 256 GB NVME might give **some trouble** later since; you will have to install an OS (Please don't install windows. you would have a much better file and space management with Linux... Specially Ubuntu Server) ... so, I would suggest selecting a variant with more space or upgrade it later on. I am saying this **considering that an OS (for example Ubuntu Server, etc) would require around 25 to 30 gb** \\+ the **movies or TV-Series you would keep.**\n3. Processor is great, since it supports the following:\n   1. **H.264**\n   2. **H.265**\n   3. **VP9**\n   4. **MPEG-2**\n   5. **But I would recommend choosing a better processor for \"enhanced support\".**\n4.

Also the I/O over usbc will probably be an issue at some point but I haven’t had issues while not downloading a lot of media. \n\nOverall, I think this was a perfect first home server to learn what I’m doing and get a v1 up and running.

Also no chance to ads pcie cards for a faster/second nic for a router or a pcie to sata adapter for plentyfull storage. b) no because even if you find an ATX refurbished PCs, with full desktop hardware, dell and hp don't make standard parts. You can't replace the MoBo or the PSU and that comes with important limitations. Even if you can physically fit many HDDs (something I've done with 3d printed parts myself) you won't have the power cords to connect them. However the full size case and hardware gives you many more options. \nConclusion: I say buy one of these refurbished PCs, but look for a full desktop. The best tell I can give you is look at the back, if you see pcie expansion card slots then u good.",

I pretty much have to mute everything in the house making sound and consciously make myself over enunciate. Moved whisper to my GPU, which has helped some. And swapped from the \"Hey Jarvis\" command to \"Ok Nabu\" which I don't really like, but it does have a larger training dataset (especially for female voices).

It’s just faster, truly (if you look at the comments on my other post, you’ll see this sentiment echoed from a few other users). \n\nAccuracy issue: Try a larger language model for whisper (would also suggest using “faster whisper”, though some of the comments on my other post said “parakeet” is even faster). What I mean by a larger language model, is changing from “tiny” in whisper to another larger one. I’ve found “small.en” to work great. “Medium.en” worked amazing, but since I’m running it on CPU the extra 1 second of delay was annoying for me (model choices here: https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/blob/master/faster_whisper/utils.py#L12-L31 ). I’ll be trying out parakeet this weekend, because if it’s faster I’m hoping I can go “a model size up” and still get the same speed I currently have (which for locally processed commands that aren’t passed off to the LLM is faster than even Alexa itself). \n\nEDIT: on the accuracy side, I have no idea what you’re using hardware wise for the satellite. I tried the “ATOM echo” first for this project as the voice satellite and it’s a hot pile of dogshit. Terrible device. I thought my setup just didn’t work…as it turns out, it’s a bad microphone and worse speaker. The Jabra does an incredible job, even with background noise. My point here is that even with a great model, if the mic just simply can’t pick up what you’re saying, you’re always going to have bad results. ",

Given that he's using this system to basically replace every possible subscription service he might otherwise be using, that doesn't seem like that high of a cost.\n\n\nMind you, I don't think anyone who's setting up these systems is truly expecting to come out ahead cost wise of tech companies which sell their products at a loss because they make the money on data.

This server costs me about $18 a month in electricity, I pay for a VPN that costs me $100 a year and I switched to a fiber internet provider once I was no longer locked into paying for internet packaged with my cable (since I was able to cancel cable). So electricity usage for the server in a year is $216, plus the VPN brings me to $316. It has quite literally in every sense of the word paid for itself already and will continue to do so, even when I need to replace failed hard drives. \n\nThen on top of all that, even if I ran it and it cost me exactly the same…my data would remain my own (luckily I get cost savings AND privacy).

If you use the arrow keys to quickly switch photos on the Immich demo, you’ll notice a lag of a few seconds before the image changes. \n\nWe're always working on improving this, but it's already pretty good - I think it mainly depends on your connection to the Immich server.
