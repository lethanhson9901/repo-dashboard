I wanted to turn it into a server, but I couldn't enable USB debugging because I couldn't see the screen.\n\n**The Fix:** I used a USB keyboard and blindly typed my PIN, then connected it to Samsung DeX to view the screen and enable USB debugging.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n**OS:** Ubuntu (via Proot-Distro in Termux)  \n**Access:** SSH (automated with Termux:Boot)  \n**Tunnel:** [Playit.gg](http://Playit.gg) (to bypass port forwarding)\n\nIt now sits in my drawer running a MC server for friends. Runs cool and uses almost zero electricity compared to my PC.\n\n**I wrote a full guide on the scripts and the \"blind unlock\" process here:** [Dev.to](https://dev.to/lahiru01/no-screen-no-problem-turning-a-dead-s10-into-a-headless-minecraft-server-3k26) article",

They have better cameras than almost any webcam and even than most IP cameras. \n\nIts ARM which is getting more and more use outside of small mobile devices, and its essentially a full computer with linux. \n\nLack of IO is the only major downside, but you can still use usb hub to expand it.\n\nI mean, NASA clearly knows this, they used an old samsung phone as part of the helicopter drone they sent to Mars. I dont remember the full list of what it was responsible for though, only that they used its gyros ans accelerometer when the dedicated one failed.",

Batteries in a rack, is not a great idea. There's a reason why servers don't have batteries because even one faulty battery can be a big hazard.\nNeed to mod the battery out.\n\nSince each phone company and then even each phone model have their unique hardware layouts and features, it's probably better to use one device of same type than to make a solution that fits all, i.e., to maybe use one specific phone model or maybe just an r-pi or mini pc, or rack etc.",

And i was happy! Upgrading to Ryzen mini-PC brought me way less emotions than getting stuff up on tv box. It's completely silent (literally nothing moves with USB SSD), it eats <10W with a USB 2.5 HDD (or SSD for even less!), and it mostly comes with \"batteries included\" - WiFi, Ethernet, BT, USB 3.0+2.0 out of the box! And it can easily transcode H264\\\\H265 4K with Jellyfin! Ran a whole \\*arr, torrents, Jellyfin, Jackett, etc on that box. \n\nSure , Ryzen mini-PC is way more powerful, has way more RAM and storage, has SATA for additional drive and more USB ports.\n\nBut i still have some warm feelings bound to this box.

That's why many opt for cloud. \n\n\nMy company did an interesting experiment where the base load was handled internally and then any peaks were dynamically scaled with AWS.

Seems like a pretty typical pattern, but I know at least 3 teams here struggled with this for a while\n- The limiting factor at some point became the ingress/egress of our internal server farm (or more accurately, the LB in front of it) and scaling that was nontrivial. As a workaround more workload could be transferred to cloud but meh\n\n\nBut honestly overall the biggest issue was lack of interest unfortunately.

Even exiftool does this when rewriting metadata (see [Exiftool FAQ #13, Why is my file smaller after I use ExifTool to write information?](https://exiftool.org/faq.html#Q13).\n\nIt's also possible that the camera specific MakerNotes will be removed. For example, the old Picasa program was one that would strip away the MakerNotes when it was told to write changes into the file. The only camera that I can recall that Picasa didn't strip MakerNotes from was Canon.\n\nThis is also one thing that is so frustrating about the galleries on DPReview. So many of their \"straight from the camera\" are edited. A straight from the camera file is not going to mention Adobe in any of its metadata, yet many do.",

I've been using Immich for a while and the metadata parsing can definitely be hit-or-miss with some camera models, so this crowdsourced approach makes a lot of sense. \n\nFor anyone considering participating, definitely heed the warning about taking generic photos. EXIF data can contain way more than you might expect - GPS coordinates, device serial numbers, sometimes even thumbnails of other photos. I'd recommend taking some test shots of random objects, landscapes, or your coffee mug rather than anything identifiable. \n\nYou could also use an older phone or camera if you have one lying around, since they're specifically looking for device variety. The more obscure camera models they get data from, the better the parsing will be for everyone. \n\nThanks for sharing this - hadn't seen it posted anywhere else either.",

Something that hindered my interest in hosting it previously which was fixed in 1.21.5 (1.21.11 is current) is that plant growth, mob farms, etc operate normally in force loaded chunks (vanilla server feature) regardless of player presence. I think the idea of making the world, it's mechanisms, and its mob interactions persistent and asynchronous to player interaction is something that really makes the game more engaging. No need to AFK to benefit from the industrialization that naturally accompanies progress in the game, for example. Which is also nice as someone with a full time job 😅\n\nI highly recommend people look into self-hosting a drasl server too. You can set it up so you can have an online world that allows or disallows simultaneous offline play, \"3rd party online\" with accounts authenticated through your drasl instance, and/or passthrough to Mojang servers. Not super valuable to me but nice to make my Minecraft purchase robust to arbitrary decisions regarding accounts by Microsoft, and I can \"merge\" offline and online accounts so I can log into the same \"player\" on the server using both Mojang auth servers or my own, using different credentials if I so choose.",

          "text": "As many others have mentioned Home Assistant.\n\nBut more to the point - as soon as you want anything to be tied together. So many services either don't provide APIs, or have shuttered/heavily restricted APIs which they used to have.\n\nThat means if you want to use them you have to leverage backdoors (like reverse engineered APIs) instead of official methods to do something (e.g. download an original activity file from Strava) or everything (download anything from Garmin Connect), and even then that might not be possible.\n\nAs soon as you need to have anything linked together it becomes a delicate stack of cards that's prone to braking at any moment and often seems to be impossible.  Self Hosted isn't perfect, but usually has good enough APIs to support you doing what the hell you want, or simply just picks up changes you make to files/sidecar files anyway (and allows you to directly access those files).\n\nOne example in my stack is the simple operation of Geotagging photos taken on my DSL and uploading to Google Photos.  Without a self hosted stack this would be impossible - Google haven't seen fit to allow externally taken photos to be a) uploaded easily, b) tagged with locations from Google Timeline & Google Health activities. (Let alone anything more exotic like blending Google Timeline with Garmin Connect to improve accuracy).\n\nWith self hosting that functionality has been possible, where all the sketchy limitations come down to the reliance on third parties (oh how I wish Garmin Connect allowed watches/Bike Computers to directly upload to S3-Compatible/Box/Google Drive/OneDrive/SFTP type storage).\n\nFirstly is a self written and hosted platform similar to Dawarich that takes the location data from my phone via Home Assistant (the latter calls a webhook) every 30 seconds/change; imports activities from Garmin Connect (via garmin\\_export, triggered by Home Assistant webhooks in response to Garmin Connect app notifications); and imports GPS Logger logs (car, transit, taxi) - uploaded by Folder Sync which also triggers a webhook to scan.\n\nI call this Dawarich like platform Sainz as that's the VMs name and I'm rubbish at naming stuff - it's not actually Dawarich as it started as a logger for Transit trips and snowballed from their such it now includes location tracking from Forza Horizon too.\n\nThis means I have a record of accurate (GPS Logger, Garmin) and approx. (Home Assistant App) coordinates for where I've been.\n\nSo when I go out with my DSLR, which is usually on a walk being recorded on my watch, I will already have all the locations recorded in a database by the end of the day when I get home/to the hotel.\n\nI am then able to :-\n\n1. Insert Memory Card into Tablet and open Folder Sync - copies photos to my tablet (1st Backup).\n2. A second Folder Sync pair then copies these to my NAS (and when done triggers a webhook on Sainz) - (2nd Backup) which can often take all night and longer\n3. Once those photos are uploaded the webhook it triggers scans for all the files in that scratch folder and logs to a database.\n4. Both 3. and the Activities uploads tasks queue another task to scan photos - all photos with no tagged geodata that have a location recorded within 5 seconds get written to a library folder used by PhotoPrism and then tagged with the Geolocation data (those without any Geolocation are copied anyway).  If the file is over two weeks old it falls back on the Home Assistant App location data if it's within 30 seconds (the two weeks wait is to allow me time to fix garmin\\_export issues which happen while on holiday).\n5. This triggers a library scan in PhotoPrism to pickup all the new photos\n6. Then triggers another task which uploads all GeoTagged photos to Google Photos (using rclone) and to my backup cloud storage (3rd Backup - again using rclone).  The Google Photos limitation is because you can't delete/amend/modify previously uploaded photos using their pathetic API.\n7. I also have a script which writes the PhotoPrism changes (Titles and Descriptions) back to the files, which thanks to using Rclone means those get backed up to the original photo on my cloud storage.\n\nWith all this place it also means all my Forza Horizon screenshots (uploaded to One Drive by the Xbox and pulled down with Rclone) get tagged with their in game location (not that I'm actually doing that with anything yet)",

I can turn off my laptop, go to a different room, switch to my tablet, or go to a coffee shop. All the coding stuff including my tmux sessions, websites in development, build compiling, etc stays running on the server.\n\nAdditionally, my laptop is not great and so this frees up my laptop resources. My original motivation to even learning how to set it up was so that I could get better FPS while gaming and programming at the same time 😂. I don't do that much anymore but the principal still applies. By offloading work to my server, which has 16gb of ram and a 6-core CPU, my laptop stays running much snappier. Of course this wouldn't be an issue if I owned a really expensive laptop, but alas I do not. Old office towers on the other hand are very cheap on the used market.\n\nI should note I also SSH into the server at the same time, so I have a terminal window open beside Code Server for convenience and running TUIs and whatnot.",

It isn't particularly like invidious, because it's a GUI for your videos that you yourself have downloaded on your machine as opposed to being an alternative GUI for other videos that live on YouTube.\n\nIt doesn't have a recommendation algorithm per se, but it does suggest similar videos based on keywords and tags, which are still available on YouTube but are hidden in the GUI. And it also has subtitle indexing which makes it easier to search for videos based on subtitles. And it has comment saving as well, though that isn't searchable. I actually find the comments much, much easier to search through since they're all loaded in at once on the one page.\n\nYou can set it up to either retain videos forever, which is what I do since I'm in it for the sake of archival and data hoarding. Or you can configure it to automatically delete videos you've watched X days after you watched them. And you also define what channels it should download videos from, how many videos it should download, if you do or do not want shorts/streams, and so on. Pretty much everything is configurable, as you'd probably expect from a foss project.\n\nAlthough it's not invidious at all, I thought I'd mention it because it kind of fits OPs question (I find it considerably more responsive than the laggy mess YouTube's desktop UI is), and in the long term, once I've hoarded enough videos, I plan to begin watching videos exclusively via TA and not on YouTube itself. Sadly I don't think I'll be able to entirely escape YouTube/google, because you do need to supply a cookie if you want to watch age restricted or members only videos (of you have a channel membership). But at least I'll get a say in how and what videos I want to watch\n\nThere's no algorithm though. It does have APIs, so I suppose there's nothing stopping you from making your own, maybe that's the sort of thing a small, locally hosted, AI model would be good for. But nobody has done anything like that as far as I'm aware (truthfully probably intentional - a lot of people want to get away from algorithms anyway)",

Hudu's GUI looked the best, but I'm really the only one looking at it lol so that part didn't matter to me.

If it helps to mention, I used InvoiceNinja (which was also great) before that, but the invoicing alone wasn't enough.\n\nAlso, is it too late to add OPNsense?

TLDR: keep a copy of your docker volume AND create a sqlite backup for good measure. \n\nPersonally I have 2 physical copies on an external disk of the whole docker folder i've set up, plus an encrypted offsite backup on a VPS. I should be golden with the 3-2-1 backup strategy rule. (Edit: oh, and I have borgbackup set up, so my backups are actually incremental, deduplicated and compressed. So I could easily roll back to a specific date in the event that my data has been corrupted (say, I get crypto'd))\n\nALSO, as you mentioned, password is rather critical, so I have a monthly calendar reminder where I manually export the Vaultwarden database (from the Web UI under Tools) in a JSON file, and here's the kicker: KeepassXC can create a new password vault USING Bitwarden's exported JSON. So I end up having a Nth backup methode of my main password vault as a good old kdbx file; I keep one copy on my cellphone for example.",

          "text": "At least to me it sounded like you're actually asking for two categories.  Self-hosted FOSS software that's better than proprietary competitors in terms of the quality of software...  And situations where even if it's the same software there's a tangible, non-philisophical, non-hypothetical benefit to self-hosting vs using the paid, external form of a service.\n\nFor me the real standout standout \"I wouldn't even bother with an external service, this is the only way this product works for me\" categories are having a good media server and good password manager.\n\nMedia server:  Selfhosting a media server cuts down on network load since all those bits are flying between server and client on a local network, vs everyone in your house streaming from the internet and clogging up your internet connection.  Plus self-hosted media servers are going to let you install whatever plugins you want for customizing what \\*you\\* want to use a media server for:  Listening to music on the bus or watching movies in 4K glory at home.  Won't inject ads at arbitrary, algorithmically determined but utterly stupid points in the show/movie the way some streaming services do.  Obviously when you compare vs a streaming service like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video there's a huge tradeoff in terms of library size and effort of library curation, but at the same time if the movie I want to watch is on my jellyfin server and on Amazon Prime Video.... Jellyfin is going to be the higher quality, no-ads experience.\n\nPassword manager:  I guess for me this is more about hypothetical situations and peace of mind and less about compared featureset, since I self-host vaultwarden and I could easily just replace it with a free tier bitwarden account with feature parity.  But over the past few years the number of data breaches of password managers has been *daunting*.  And I get that they store everything in encrypted blocks and yay for them, but those encrypted blocks are paired with email addresses that have probably lost a multitude of passwords in *other* data breaches available on the dark web.  I just don't even want to deal with any of this.  My vaultwarden instance and the  internet are completely unaware of eachother.  I tailscale in when I need to access it from the bitwarden app on my phone.  I'm not quite so naive as to think I've built an impenetrable fortress, as so many of those have been breached.  But I've at least raised the difficulty way past what breaching it would be worth, and for a password manager it needs to stay that way.",

Context here matters, so I'll continue. \n\nYou go into features or experiences.\n\nBeing in control; in more ways than one.  My data, my rules. I don't have to worry about strangers (developers, maintainers, random contractors, 'advertising partners') slurping up my information, leaking sensitive information, or selling out to advertisers.  This is a big deal for me, as I've grown up relatively secure with the mindset that the internet is the wild-west and don't carelessly share things with internet strangers. Many of these big cloud services are nothing more than big strangers.\n\nCost savings.  This is hard to always quantify... but some things on the internet are simply too expensive to justify paying someone else to do it. Dropping $300-400CAD on a 'new' mini PC could theoretically pay itself back in less than a year depending on what you run.  Buying 'used' or repurposing old gear really only needs replacement parts and power to be considered... but I'll gladly 'waste' 10-20Watts hosting something myself.   \nThis holds true for me with storage as well... I could self-host 42TB at a rate of $5.16CAD/mo if I want it paid back in 12 months... I could triple this deployment and self-host mirrors at family/friend locations and pay it back over 3 years.\n\nWhere cloud providers excel (in my opinion) .. is where you either \\*can't\\*, or \\*don't\\* want to own your own hardware or service.. Short-term use items are perfect use-cases for cloud.  Use it, pay monthly for a bit, then walk away... be careful though... there's nothing more permanent than that which is supposed to be temporary.  \nEmail is one of those things that can technically be done, but the cloud giants have really made it difficult to do this without ending up on a dozen different block-lists.  Email is a tough one to justify either way... but it's becoming increasingly more important with the trends in the internet... verify your ID / age to participate in chat, social media, etc.. Combine this with the fact that many online services don't have proper sign-in authentication/security and heavily \\*rely\\* on email addresses to send you sign-in codes or magic links... loose your email for whatever reason and you loose more than access to some forums and a couple video games... even if you have credentials for sites, an increasing number will email you anyway when you attempt to sign-in.",

And since I control what's on it, I can put my own band on it or anything else I record. I can rip demos and other stuff that local bands from my youth recorded and self-released in tiny quantities, which is a huge plus, because that stuff will never be on any streamer. I have explicit versions of albums that many streamers only have in radio or otherwise censored edits as well. So for me, self-hosting my music and rediscovering albums I bought as a teen is absolutely mind blowing.  \n\nI also love actually just having network shares, which isn't strictly in the same category as other \"proper\" sevices I have, but literally just having folders accessible from the phone, my PC, my laptop, my steam deck and being able to share files with family through a dedicated LAN share blows any cloud storage out of the water.",

For example I paid for my 12TB main storage + 12TB offsite backup 500€ (600 USD), meanwhile at Google Cloud I would pay 500€ per month for the same service essentially except for the fact that a NAS in your home network will always be faster and it's easier to make it work with other services you might want to selfhost.\n\nMedia streaming and management. Others already mentioned jellyfin and the *arr stack. I just throw Audiobookshelf in there. It's a selfhosted platform for managing and listening to podcasts. Although podcasts are free (that's also how this server sources the podcasts) apps like Spotify or Apple Podcasts have annoying ads and try to make you listen to stuff you don't want. Also Apple Podcasts is censoring heavily the decription and notes of every podcast without letting you or the hosts know.\n\nSmarthome. Clouddevices are privacy nightmares and security hazards in every private network. Do yourself a favor and don't let them connect to the internet. Just control them via HomeAssistant.\n\nArchive. I'm using Paperless to digitalize, categorize and archiving documents. Extremely helpful at somehow surviving the bureaucratic madness in my country. Just throwing them into folders on google drive or dropbox would insane.\n\nBut most of the time selfhosting is not about receiving a better or cheaper service, most of the time it's about freedom, privacy and knowing they cannot pull the plug tomorrow.",

I am thinking of implementing LUKS encryption on my laptop hard drive, though.\n* I do not have a permanent offsite backup, so if my house burns down (while my laptop is \"home\"), so does my data.

Look forward to trying it.\n\nMy only piece of advice would be to add a disclaimer somewhere in the README that it was developed with Qwen/AI Assistance.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I think every developer should be using AI tools to help with development. I use it myself via Claude Code. They’re a fantastic productivity booster when used under supervision/with manual code review.\n\nBut for the time being I do think it should be disclosed.  AI still makes tons of errors and if your users know ahead of time they can pay a little closer attention.\n\nCheers",

          "text": "Hi there. Very similar to my setup so I have a question because I don't often see Fritzbox routers here:\n\nFritzbox routers (at least my model 7690) has  this NAT problem where you cannot see the network if you are on the network and in the VPN. Its called NAT loopback or NAT hairpin. \n\nThis is the scenario: I am in the city, so I connect to Wireguard because I want to access an internal page, I get home later and the VPN client is still up on my mobile, when I am on the local network, the VPN client ends up blocking all traffic to and from my mobile because it does not know how to handle the NAT when you are with a local address, accessing the public address.\n\nI tried to explain this to Fritzbox support and they didn't know what NAT was, so I gave up with them. Its crazy how somebody can just pretend they have no idea what you are talking about so they can close the ticket as \"delusional customer\" or something like this.\n\nDo you have this problem and are you able to work around it?\n\nMy homelab: In my network, as above but I have a old I5-46xxK processor in an old PC, instead of a Pi. This particular i5 processor support QSV, so I chose it because it can transcode quite well and uses low amount of power when idle. I love the Pi5, have had many Pis in my life, but this PC, although old (DDR3) is really low powered, 32GB RAM and runs Windows Server because I find the block deduplication easy to setup, reliable and efficient. I have a second old PC I use for running docker, Ollama, etc. for my application stack.\n\nEdited to add: I work in a datacenter for a living so from my experience, RAID, anywhere except on RAID specific hardware, in a datacenter, is a bad move. I prefer to have the disks all as stand-alone but I sync my precious folders to multiple devices. This gives me the advantage of lower power, redundant copies and I get to use all the rest of the disk space which would otherwise be used by the RAID.",

Definitely worth it for the learning experience alone.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!",

We've tackled the duplicate book problem once and for all, built a sick stats system that actually shows you how your library is being used, added dynamic/Magic Shelves, and a powerful & robust new OAuth system. The amount of new features and fixes in this release is incredible. This is the biggest, most community-driven update CWA has ever had and I'm very grateful to everyone that helped work on it.\" - **CrocodileStick**\n\n**If you enjoy the project and want to support the coffee fund for v5.0.0, you can do so here:**\n\n[Support the project here on Ko-Fi!](https://ko-fi.com/crocodilestick)\n\n# Release V4.0.0 Changelog\n\n# 🚀 Major Features\n\n# Here is the highlight reel:\n\n* **🔍 Smart Duplicate Detection & Resolution:** A completely rebuilt hybrid SQL/Python engine. It detects 95% of duplicates other systems miss (ignoring articles like \"The\", fuzzy matching, etc.). Includes **Auto-Resolution** to merge books automatically and **Scheduled Scans**.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/udmjcnu2yagg1.gif\n\n* **✨ Magic Shelves:** Dynamic, rules-based collections. Create shelves based on tags, ratings, series, or publication dates (e.g., \"Rated 4+ stars\", \"Published in 2024\"). **Bonus:** These sync directly to Kobo devices!\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z0co4j24yagg1.gif\n\n* **📊 Deep Stats Centre:** A brand new dashboard. Track **User Activity** (reading velocity, top users), **Library Stats** (format distribution, language), and **Peak Usage Hours**. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/i99zx0t4yagg1.gif\n\n* **📧 Auto-Send to eReader:** Set it and forget it. New books can be automatically emailed to your Kindle/Kobo/eReader immediately upon ingest, with smart delays to allow for metadata fetching first.\n* **🛡️ Robust OAuth Rewrite:** Completely rewritten authentication. Now supports **LDAP, Reverse Proxy (Authelia/Authentik), and OIDC** natively with auto-user creation. No more redirect loops.\n* **✅ EPUB Fixer 2.0 (No more E999 Errors):** Specifically targets Amazon's strict rejection criteria. Automatically fixes language tags, XML declarations, and broken CSS so your Send-to-Kindle works reliably.\n* **🏷️ Auto-Metadata Fetching:** CWA can now automatically fetch metadata (Google Books, Kobo, Hardcover, etc.) during ingest or before sending to a device.\n\n# ⚡ Performance & Quality of Life\n\n* **Performance Overhaul:** Search is drastically faster, and we’ve moved to WebP thumbnails which reduces page weight by 97%. Large libraries (50k+ books) load instantly now.\n* **Network Share Mode:** Running on a NAS/Unraid? We added a specific mode to handle NFS/SMB locking issues to prevent database corruption.\n* **Better Kobo Integration:** Improved sync reliability, annotations, and a new \"Featured Products\" endpoint.\n* **Hardcover.app ID Fetch:** Automatically links your library to Hardcover for better tracking.\n* **Enhanced Manual Sending:** Want to send a book to a friend? You can now type in any email address on the fly to send a book without creating a user account.\n\n# 🔗 Links\n\n* **Full Change Log:** [Link to GitHub Release/ Changelog](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/releases/tag/v4.0.0)\n* **Docker Hub:** [Link to DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/crocodilestick/calibre-web-automated)\n* **Repo:** [Link to GitHub Project Page](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated)\n\n# Upcoming changes 🔮\n\nMajor changes are still coming to CWA including:\n\n* A brand new Svelte based Frontend. The days of the current Bootstrap UI are numbers and migrating to Svelte ensures that the new UI will still be easy to edit and add to for as many contributors as possible due to it's very familiar syntax to traditional sites and can be compiled with Capacitor for native mobile apps which is very exiting\n* A new web reader, epub.js is a little dated now and there are now much better alternatives\n* A much more robust & powerful progress syncing system that will be able to have CWA act as a single source of truth for reading progress no matter what device you read from\n* Full Text Search functionality\n* 🐁 is coming very soon, the integration just had to be as sensible & respectful to the 🐁 and it's servers as possible and a good balance has now been reached\n\n**A massive thank you to the 60+ contributors who helped test, translate, and code this release.**\n\n**TLDR: CWA now has a new, robust OAuth system, a new smart Duplicate Detection & Auto-Resolution system, a brand-new & very powerful Stats Dashboard, Auto-Send to eReader functionality as well as Automatic Metadata Fetching, a new and Improved Automatic EPUB Fixer service, a new Network Share mode for increased compatibility & reliability with NFS & SMB shares, a major performance overhaul making the whole service more lightweight than ever and so much more!

That’s the kind of stuff that makes a self hosted library feel like a “real” product instead of just a folder of epubs with a UI stapled on. Also appreciate the Network Share mode callout, feels like half the issues in r/selfhosted are “NFS did me dirty again.”\n\nCurious about the Svelte frontend plans: are you aiming to keep things editable for people who just want to tweak templates and CSS, or will it mostly be for folks comfortable building and compiling the app?\n\nEither way, this is the kind of update that makes me want to blow up my current setup and redo it properly.",

As to Svelte, one of the main reasons for choosing it was that it's the most community friendly modern framework available since all of it's syntax is almost identical to normal html, CSS & JS with a few \"runes\" sprinkled in here and there so it should be easy for people to pick up and keep making changes to.

I use Calibre-Web and Calibre--I use Calibre to manage my books and Calibre-Web just reflects them, I don't use Calibre-Web to administrate--can I use this that way, too, or does it have to be an independent setup from the main Calibre program?  Can it run alongside Calibre-Web while I figure out how it works, or will it replace it?  Thanks!",

You may want to check out online tools or apps like Everplan  (no affiliation) that will walk you through all the different considerations, including passwords.  \n\nIt can get tricky, for example: any passwords stored in an iPhone/iCloud keychain are likely to be unavailable to anyone after your death due to how it’s designed. following a comprehensive, prepared plan can ensure that you don’t miss anything.",

Be extra sure to document anything bank or finance related. \n\n- document day to day chores that break the house if not done properly or get you in trouble with the government that only you do (like how to clear the Central hvac filters or how to do taxes)\n\nTech stuff:\n- regularly backup any important data to preferably ONE external hdd and make use it is stored in a simple file system. That means scanned documents, pictures, perhaps phone backups, documentation and digital instructions. You should not expect your SO to do anything more than plug it in her laptop, browse and double click. Presumably tech and self hosting was your hobby and not hers. \n\n- make it so any custom hardware can be simply unplugged (routers, switches, servers etc). You might think leaving instructions is enough but it never is. Something as simple as a mesh system in addition to the isp gateway can and will confuse your SO when she grieves.",

The advantage of using plain text is that it takes up much less space than formatted text or a database (provided it's easy to read), so I don't have hosting problems (unless Proton, like any commercial company, decides to change its service in the future). I also periodically print a copy and save it in a folder that will be available when I leave. I destroy previous printouts.\nI try to update the text file from a single device, from where I also upload it to Proton and then delete it from the same device where I made the changes.
