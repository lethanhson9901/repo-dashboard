Which means one thing: people are about to dig through dozens of ancient \"what's the best self-hosted Discord alternative?\" threads on here and find antiquated opinions and advice.\n\nWhat are we *actually* using? What are the clients that work well? What are options that pass the \"wife test\" of actually being something you could convince your not-techy friends and family to install on their phones? \n\nLet's get into it. I know I'm already anticipating self-hosting *something* to replace Discord for communities/friend groups who'll naturally slough off when face ID comes along.",

TL;DR became a badge proudly worn by muppets instead of the admission of laziness and stupidity that it actually is.\n\nFolk started to lose the ability to write too - resulting in the crazy idea that an email subject line should match its content slowly drifting into ancient history. A similar thing happened in forums.\n\nWith rapidly diminishing ability remaining to deal with a matching 'Subject' and 'Content' pair - this also made dealing with forums quite tricky for most people - because who wants to deal with a bunch of posts titled:\n\n- help\n- need help\n- help me\n- stuck\n- it all went wrong when i did THIS\n\nIRC also started to struggle when many folk admitted that it was simply too hard to have to find and install an app, and then use multiple pieces of information to connect to a chat room\n\n- nick\n- server\n- port\n\nThis was simply not sustainable. Three pieces of information *and* an app!? No mere human can manage it without the assistance of 2 nearby nerds.\n\nSo now you have folk that can't read much, and can't write much - this pretty well killed the idea of a searchable FAQ - so instead of having a decent FAQ that newbies can read - we need to drag new users into a walled garden chatroom where most of them can ask the same question and get multiple similar but different answers from folk that want to feel important by having flair based on activity metrics.\n\nSo enter the chat providers - with their pretty interfaces and the idea that you can have your very own chat server^*\n\n...and information that should have been free on the internet could now be sponged up by these tech-leeches and sold back to you by surrounding it with adverts and 'boosts' or the like.\n\n^* ^by ^'very ^own' ^we ^mean ^'not ^yours ^at ^all. ^we ^just ^want ^to ^monetise ^you ^and ^your ^friends'",

That has active connected users distribute copies of the content so if it's popular / viral the load gets spread out.\n\nGets a bit tricky with more sensitive / private data, but technically you could safely distribute that in a similar fashion if it's encrypted with a high entropy secret from the client, nobody else would be able to decrypt it then, only help by being a content mirror.",

I've already put in the effort of setting it up so all you have to do is *install a single app on your phone\"* then you have an incredibly high chance of talking people who actually speak a lot in the community into coming over.\n\nAnd if those people come over, you bring the tag-alongs who want to lurk in active communities.\n\nIt's a domino effect, it just requires one or two extroverts to be loudly and proudly into the alternative. I've been through friend groups leaving Skype for Teamspeak, leaving Teamspeak for Mumble, leaving Mumble for Razer Comms, leaving Razer Comms for Discord. Anyone you lose in the process is someone who wasn't really committed to the community anyway.",

Avatars don't come through either. \n\nThe interface is very familiar though and so it has a lot of promise. I think the framework is there. The other advantage is you can setup a bridge not between Stoat and Discord that relays messages between the two instances.

As far as closest feature set to Discord that has \"enough\" polish for Discord familiar users to use (including custom Emoji's), Mattermost checks most of the boxes, though not great if you need extended features like calls and such since even with self host you have to pay for. I don't need that but others have used Jitsi as an alternative or TeamSpeak I guess.\n\nI do like the interface on Matrix better in some cases, but just the pace of improvements (using Schildichat instead of stock Element btw) across the 10+ years I've been using it, the resource bloat, the foundation financial troubles, the crazy install procedures (yes even with the Ansible playbook), and the entire CSAM stuff on the main server, really put me off. Yes, there's a reason why Matrix is used by government agencies, but I'm just not comfortable with the idea of my server possibly being exploited as a distribution node for CSAM. It's unlikely, but I'm not taking that chance.\n\nSo for now, till these other self hosted options like Foscord and such become much more production ready, I'm settling on Mattermost for now. For larger servers, you may run into some limitations, but for my small needs, it's fine.\n\nI have also tried to like XMPP as an alternative, and even though the protocol is solid, the clients just aren't good enough.",

How did we ever let it get so bad!?\n\nThe walled garden aspect of Discord bothers me too; especially for things like Community servers which already offers read only view of channels.\nI used to browse forums for hours back in the day and joined plenty too. I think of all the knowledge and resources lost from the death of message boards due to Discord.\n\nI’ve tried a couple of the replacements listed in the replies here but most are a miss due to over complexity for the average user or lack of feature set.\n\nThe internet needs a FOSS messaging protocol that can deliver Discords feature set in an open accessible way, that takes the best bits of IRC, vBulletin, VoIP and makes it easy to setup in the cloud or self hosted with domain support to expose to the web and search engines for accessibility.",

If someone has less than the required number of parts, they have the equivalent amount of information as having 0 parts. This algorithm does not get weaker with quantum computers. \n\nThe algorithm is based on the idea for how you uniquely define a polynomial. \n\nIf you have 2 points on a line, you can find the equation for that line. You make the secret you’re trying to encrypt the Y value where X=0 for that equation and pick a random slope. Then, you give people points on the graph. You can give out as many points on the graph as you want, and no matter what, no one will be able to find the Y intercept unless they get 2 points. But any 2 points will find it. \n\nThis scales up. If you want 3 people to work together like OP, you use a quadratic equation. Now you need 3 points to uniquely define your equation. \n\nThere are additional steps in the actual algorithm to further obscure the values against other weaknesses, but this is how the core math works. \n\nExtremely clever algorithm. \n\nOp this is a perfect application of this algorithm, great work!",

This allows you to give out the password and link to the vault to everyone that would need it. Because the link will not work until the trigger / switch is activated they cannot peek until you want them to. \n\nYou can also use a e-mail action to send a e-mail or text message to people with the password and link to the vault if you do not want to rely on them remembering where they stuck that password.

I just wanted to avoid that mess entirely.\n\nI didn't want to pay for a VPS to host Vaultwarden, but honestly, the main reason was that I don't trust myself. Managing a Linux server means one bad command or missed backup and my passwords are gone forever. I wanted something maintenance-free where I couldn't accidentally nuke my own vault.\n\nSo, I hacked together a Bitwarden-compatible server that runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers + D1 for free. Deploy once, forget forever.\n\nI called it `warden-worker`. It worked \"good enough\" for me, so I pushed it to GitHub, thought \"maybe I'll post this later,\" and then immediately forgot about it.\n\nFast forward to this week. I was doing some repo cleanup and realized I had turned off my GitHub notifications. I checked the repo and... what??\n\n* 400+ forks\n* Issues threads in Chinese?\n* People writing guides on how to deploy it??\n* Someone explaining how to fix my bugs in the issues\n\nThe best part is that a user named qaz741wsd856 apparently took my abandoned skeleton and turned it into a full-blown project with KV support and the actual Vaultwarden frontend. Their fork is objectively better than mine in every way.\n\nI'm still using my original \"good enough\" version because it’s stable and I’m lazy, but it's wild to see an entire community spin up around a project I thought was dead.\n\nIf you want the original (don't use this): [https://github.com/deep-gaurav/warden-worker](https://github.com/deep-gaurav/warden-worker) \n\nIf you want the one that actually works (use this): [https://github.com/qaz741wsd856/warden-worker](https://github.com/qaz741wsd856/warden-worker)\n\nJust wanted to share because I'm still processing how weird open source can be sometimes.",

I have personally found some incredibly interesting software by Chinese-speaking people & communities just by trawling through search engines for solutions to my extremely dumb self induced problems. [Here's one I remember](https://github.com/mofeng-git/One-KVM) - it's PiKVM style software that first started as a fork of the PiKVM software that was better suited towards cobbling it together out of cheap parts (cheap USB capture cards, CH9329 for keyboard+mouse input rather than Linux USB Gadget capable SBCs, things like that) but looking now to link it here, it looks like they've done a functional rewrite in Rust. I believe the original PiKVM fork is in the 'python' branch, if you'd like to see.\n\nI've seen a few English-speaking Chinese people here and there talking about their side of the community, but the language barrier means there's not a whole lot of crossover - programming languages are languages unto themselves, though, so software sometimes bridges that barrier.",

That works out to be about $4.5 dollars per day since the first donation. A large portion of these donations have come from the last few weeks.\n\n  \nThis includes a mix of one-time donations (largest ever was $50) and monthly donations. Currently, I make about $35 month due to monthly recurring donations.\n\n  \nIt took about 6,000 GitHub stars before I received the first donation through GitHub Sponsors. Termix now sits at just over 10,000 for reference, with \\~4 million Docker pulls.\n\n  \nIn my case, there are no incentives to donate for any reason (no benefit other than a badge on your GitHub profile). The default and smallest donation amount that I have on my donation page is $1/month.\n\n  \nIn a few months (maybe a year), I'll do another post updating everyone who is curious!\n\n  \nThanks,  \nLuke",

I receive maybe 1 donation every 6 months and get about $3-$4 in ad revenue share per day, so $100/month or so. So ya, I feel ya. Overall, I am fine with it. I do it as a hobby because I enjoy it, not to replace my day job.\n\nI post this for context for people to understand that the vast majority of software out there like this that is free cannot in any way be sustainable. That's why I wasn't even surprised when I heard the TailwindCSS team got cut from 4 people to 1, and that they were dropping the few devs they had. The fact they even earned enough to afford even afford multiple developers, even with industry-wide popular software with nearly 100,000 stars on Github is pretty astonishing. At the end of the day, donation-based models just are not really sustainable. If you want to make an income over your free, open source, self-hosted app you create, you better have something that millions wants and then have a premium model people can purchase. The donation model does not work for 99% of devs. The only people making any money from donations is because of gifts from live streaming, or from extraordinarily popular Patreon exclusive projects people can subscribe to.\n\nI once setup a Patreon and got about $40/month in subs. The problem is the whole hassle of doing it all, trying to come up with exclusive stuff for Patreon, or just the weird vibe you now get from some people who sub $5 and now expect special treatment, wasn't really worth it to for me.",

That spits out JSON files that Glance treats as a Custom API.  For those, Glance only ever sees the JSONs.\n\n\\- For the Arcade games, my arcade cab runs EmulationStation-DE as the frontend.  When I start a game, ES-DE runs a script that adds that game to a JSON file which is accessible by Glance.  That populates the \"Last Played Arcade\" section.\n\n\\- For the arcade high scores, I have a button combo on my arcade cab that sends a screenshot to a shared network folder.  I have a locally-run PHP webapp (more AI slop) that looks for new screenshots, and lets me manually tag them and generate another JSON for Glance (and my High Scores webpage).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osf6515wpohg1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=29fa7d6e54018945085f523d7add74dd5854e6cf\n\n  \n\\- For the \"Currently Playing Games\" & \"Recently Finished Games\", I have a scraper setup in Docker. It goes out a couple times a day and pulls the corresponding Shared Widgets (info & example for the widgets is at the bottom of [Grouvee's help page](https://www.grouvee.com/help/)) from [my Grouvee games tracker](https://www.grouvee.com/user/73634-RxBrad/shelves/381115-played/).  Then a script converts that widget into JSON for Glance to use.  Again, this is more AI slop which I assume nobody actually wants shared.",

My Brother laser printer, which only cost $75 in 2008 but has worked like a champ and survived four houses, three time zones, two kids, a university degree, and my entire career to date.\n\nLately however, its struggling. It won't hold a network connection for much longer than 15 minutes, and once it loses it, only a power cycle will bring it back online.\n\nI've tried everything. Wifi, ethernet, dedicated VLAN, static IP, DHCP changes, RTSP on, RTSP off, scripts to ping the printer every 5 minutes.\n\nA normal person would have bought a new printer. A sane person would just decide to turn the printer on when they need it.\n\n**I am apparently too stubborn to be a normal person**\n\nWhy would I spend money on a new printer when I have time I can waste on the problem instead? And why would I resign myself to walking across the room when I can build something to do it for me instead?\n\nSo I built a \"Legacy Hardware Integration Bridge\":\n\n- A CUPS print server running in a docker on my Unraid machine is now the \"printer\" for all my computers. The server stays always on, so the computers never see a \"Printer Offline\" error\n- When a print job hits the CUPS queue, it triggers a state change to a sensor entity on my Home Assistant server using the Internet Printer Protocol integration\n- The state change on that sensor acts as a trigger to an automation, which causes a smart plug to switch on\n- That smart plug is now controlling the power to the printer, so when it switches on, the printer boots up, and gets a fresh connection to the network\n- Once the printer has been idle for 5 minutes, it triggers the smart plug to turn off, and everything is ready for the next print job.\n\nMy wife thinks I could have just turned the printer on whenever I needed it and spent my Sunday doing something more productive.\n \nI'm not a caveman though.

A lot of weird Sonarr/Radarr issues are just mismatched mount paths.\n\nTurn on regular backups early, before you care about the data. At minimum back up your Jellyfin config, *arr configs, and whatever you’re using for auth. Even just a tar of the config folders to that 8 TB drive on a cron is already a win.\n\nWatch your drive spin-down settings with that external. Some USB externals love to sleep aggressively, which can cause stutters in Jellyfin. You can tweak hdparm or vendor tools, or move “cold” stuff to that disk and keep frequently watched stuff on the NVMe.\n\nSince you’re on Tailscale, you can skip exposing ports to the internet and just use that as your “remote access” layer. Much safer while you’re still learning.\n\nIf you get bored and want to add “internal tools” later, that little HP box is also perfect for running stuff like a small dashboard, admin panel for your DB, etc. Things like Retool / Appsmith / UI Bakery style tools can sit in Docker too so you can poke at your data without giving yourself direct DB access all the time.\n\nOtherwise you’re on a solid path. Biggest tip: change one thing at a time, and keep a simple text file with what you did, so future you can undo the chaos.",

They take up less space, draw less power, and you won’t outgrow them as quickly.\n\nAlso, keep an eye on the USB connection. A couple of my external drive enclosures died on me, and I thought the drives were toast. Turned out it was just the USB cases. If one of your drives disappears or isn’t being detected, remove the  external USB enclosure and try directly / buy another external USB enclosure   \n\n\nPS: Always keep a 3-2-1 backup of anything you actually care about.  \nTry not to leave your external drive perched right on the edge of the table. it only takes one drop ... (maybe not one small drop but safer than sorry)",

Losing a docker-compose.yml after you spent hours tweaking it is painful.\n\nAnd if you haven't already, set up Tailscale. Makes remote access way cleaner than messing with port forwarding and dynamic DNS.\n\nYou're off to a great start.

However I'm currently a bit irritated by the Library analysis you're doing - the numbers of movies / TV Show Episodes I have don't really match with any of the statistics I have in Emby itself (only connected Emby so far), and really a bit unsure what it counts as an episode and what as a movie, considering that there are library types like \"mixed content\". \n\nIf I might make a sugguestion, grab all libraries from the server and track the statistics (growth, number of elements, size) for each of them seperately, which will also make it easier to monitor where changes are happening.\n\nAnd if I may add something else - Audiobookshelf would also be a very easy match for what you are doing as a supported server platform.",

It bridges the gap between the \"set it and forget it\" crowd and the data nerds who want to know exactly what’s happening under the hood at all times. Highly recommend giving it a spin...

      "text": "**EDIT:** Some of you think this post was written by an AI/LLM... Thank you, but it's not. I replied this to an earlier comment that got buried because of the downvotes, so I'm gonna paste this here for clarity as I'm pretty self-conscious about my writing and I'm not about to reply to every single negative comment.\n\n> I wrote every single letter of this post myself. You can check the edit history to see how many typos and poorly worded sentences I had in the initial post and how many times I've edited it since then. If you want to expose me for being an LLM, I can give you some consolation and tell you that I have LanguageTools extension installed, but apparently using commas and periods correctly makes me a robot now. Beep boop.\n\nNow I realize that reddit doesn't allow for checking the edit history but fuck it. Next time I write a post (probably never), I'll go out of my way to make it unpolished I guess.\n\nAs for the \"you must have a lot of time\" folks, well, yeah, this post took me 20-25 minutes? It was like 2am, I had time, I bust out my laptop and just started writing it. The initial post had a lot of embarrassing typos, I edited the post a few times.\n\nIf you're about to say \"jesus christ this guy is crashing out over a reddit post\", well, you're right, you won, congrats. I'm an LLM, being enthusiastic is bad, and I should write like an illiterate degenerate. I didn't think I would wake up to a bunch of \"get a load of this guy\" comments... serves me right for thinking I could express my honest feelings on reddit.\n\n**-- ORIGINAL POST BELOW --**\n\nSo a few weeks ago, one of my close friends got into homelabbing and naturally started talking to me about it. I've always wanted to try similar things but never got around to it, so this time I just said what the hell and after some research, I ordered NanoPi R6S. I found it to be a solid upper mid-range device that could satisfy my thirst for knowledge and help me learn the niche.\n\nNow, I'm pretty good with tech, and I'm very enthusiastic about it, but I'm a total noob when it comes to networking. I know what LAN stands for, and I know how to set up a Cloudflare DNS on an ISP modem, but apart from that, I might as well be a boomer. I'm kinda nervous about setting up a new router, messing with its firmware, opening ports, configuring firewall, and so on.\n\nNR6S arrives and I start researching firmware options. OpenWrt just calls my name because I have used it once years ago, and I didn't really find anything wrong with it.\n\nAfter some trial and error, I managed to flash OpenWrt on the eMMC storage of NR6S, thanks to this [absolute chad](https://github.com/StarWhiz/NanoPi-R6S-CPU-Optimization-for-Gigabit-SQM/tree/main/How%20To%20Flash%20Official%20OpenWrt%20To%20R6S%20eMMC).\n\nOkay, I now have NR6S powered by OpenWrt standing between my ISP modem and my Wi-Fi AP. I find a lot of people mentioning bridging the router on forums, so I start looking into what bridging is. OF COURSE, it makes sense, for years both my ISP modem and my Wi-Fi AP have been doing routing, but both are terribly underpowered for that task, so I can now have a dedicated ROUTER for that. I bridge the ISP modem, set my Wi-Fi unit as Dumb AP, and I already feel better about myself. But, I need some more ports... I find Netgear GS308 locally for dirt cheap and for the first time in my life, I have a dedicated network switch. Pretty cool... I guess? WAIT, you're telling me that connecting 2 of my PCs to a single switch allows me to transfer Steam games over LAN? I don't have to wait twice as long for game downloads to play something with my brother? I can just send him game files at gigabit speeds instead of my ISPs shitty 100Mbps? W switch, W Valve, W whoever's reddit comment I came upon about Steam's LAN feature.\n\nOkay, now that I have stable internet, let's Google \"self-hosted projects reddit.\" I find tons of threads, and I find some project names coming up in every single one of these threads. AdGuard Home sounds interesting, it can block ads, trackers, AND help me monitor who and what is using my bandwidth? Let's fucking go. How can I deploy it? Docker, huh? Well hello old friend, you've saved me countless hours deploying my clients' websites on VPSes, let's see how I can set you up on an OpenWrt. Well, that took less than 20 minutes, nice.\n\nI now have Docker, but do I want to ssh into my router every time I want to change a config, see the status of my containers, or restart them? There has to be a solution for that. Huh, there is, and it's called Dockge, cool. Wait, Dockge developer also has this pretty cool project called Uptime Kuma, which will give me a fancy interface for monitoring the status for all of my services. Both of them deployed in less than 10 minutes, just following the official instructions.\n\nOkay, back to AdGuard Home, what can I do here? Holy shit I can just delegate AdGuard Home to be my DNS resolver and configure a bunch of options for it? Count me in. 20 minutes of brokering peace between AGH and OpenWrt over port 80, and now I have redundant DNS resolvers, resolving all of my domain needs using parallel requests to get me to websites ASAP. Oh, and I can see AGH blocking all the TikTok and Google trackers from my family's devices, so I already want to buy a coffee for the developers.\n\nI'm fucking hooked. Let's Google some more interesting projects. Immich? I can take my data back from Google? The app looks just as fancy, and I don't care for some of the features it lacks. What could I use for storage? Maybe this spare Samsung T7 Shield I have lying around? Let's go. Export the whole data from Google Photos, mount my T7 to NR6S with a USB cable, permanently mounted it in OpenWrt, used [Immich-Go](https://github.com/simulot/immich-go) to upload it to Immich, and bob's your uncle. So. fucking. cool.\n\nWait, now I have anxiety about losing years of my photos and videos if I fully migrate to Immich. How can I fix that? Immich recommends 3-2-1 backup strategy, and they link this [article](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/) from Backblaze. Hmm, I've heard that name before. Wait, these guys will give me terabyte of storage for $6/month? Wtf do I pay Google for? But wait, how can I upload there? God bless rclone. Let's also clone to my Windows PC to fully complete the 3-2-1 strategy. Let's automate cloning processes for both local and remote backups, so that all my data gets backed up every night while I'm sleeping. All that work in less than two hours.\n\nBy the way, I thought Immich app was supposed to be inferior to Google Photos? Are you serious? I finally have a reliable search by context, file name, file extension, etc. I can set up auto-moving and archiving with CLI and so much more. Fuck Google Photos. Delete every single byte I have on there, uninstall it from all of my devices, cancel the subscription.\n\nOkay, this post is getting terribly long, so I'll try to fast-forward.\n\nI want to remotely turn on my stupid Samsung monitor without using a remote? Home Assistant.\n\nI want to have a universal note-taking and link-saving solution? Linkwarden.\n\nI want to expose my services to the internet so I can access them remotely? Cloudflared.\n\nI want to stash my fucking porn? Stash.\n\nThere are solutions for literally everything. My post serves two purposes. The first is to push all of you lurking in this subreddit, hesitant to pull the trigger, thinking you need to be Gilfoyle reincarnated to have any success at this stuff. My modest home lab is no Anton, but boy does it make this shitty corpo-ridden internet a much more tolerable place. All I needed to have was a bit of Googling skills, and a bit of patience reading through the official docs, forum threads, and reddit comments. I still have a LOT to learn about networking, but I already feel like this has been one of the most fulfilling hobbies I've had, and I'm already thinking about getting a NAS to host some stuff for my friends.\n\nSecond is to say a massive thank you to the absolute legends behind all the open-source services that we all use and love. I'm sure I will find a lot more in the coming months, and I will try my absolute best to buy all of them a coffee.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone's even going to read all of this, I just felt so good about and so passionate about my new hobby that I wanted to share it with everyone.\n\nP.S: This subreddit desperately needs a \"Discussion\" flair.",

There are a couple of caveats, like it uses musl-gcc instead of \"normal gcc\", and the file system sometimes trips you up. And USB hard drive is not the most performant either. Now I run PVE with openwrt and Xpenology as VM, it works better. ",

Turns out I can just enable SQM and now I can download whatever I want when my brother plays an online game. As for the limitations, yeah, the biggest limitation I found so far is that it uses Ash instead of Bash. It tripped me up quite a few times. Also, after setting up Immich, I found that I cannot use hardware-accelerated ML and hardware transcoding, because some drivers for NanoPi R6S are not upstreamed in OpenWrt. I'm not sure if FriendlyWrt has those drivers, and I'm not sure if I want to try. Needless to say I'll be upgrading to something more powerful down the line. Still figuring out if I'm okay with ARM or if I want to switch to x86.",

Or things break when updating, and you have to get your hands dirty. Or even worse, you're multiple updates behind and the way to get from your old version to latest doesn't work and there's not an easy path forward without doing update by update and hoping for the best. It isn't always so easy. \n\nOne reason for customizing might be you have constrained hardware and don't want to spin up a bespoke database per container and you try to reuse one database for as many as you can. That may be asking for trouble, but sometimes you do what you gotta do. It can eat a lot of time trying to get things to work.\n\nBest of luck, don't stray far off the path and it can stay mostly sunshine and rainbows!",

Make a \"production\" and \"testing\" if you will. Production should be stable, with your integrated upgrade and backup strategy. It should hum along with little to no intervention.\n\nThen have a different environment where when you see a cool new services to spin up you do it there, and don't accidentally break the things you've been using.\n\nOtherwise have fun, it's such a great hobby.

I've been accused of it myself multiple times (it's also a well known fact that neurodivergent people have similarities with how we write prose, that LLM detectors flag us for written exams at university).\n\nI've accused a few people of using LLMs myself, not necessarily in a bad way but from an observation that there was enough similarity I put out that possibility openly and they got deeply offended.\n\nAs your journey progresses you may encounter more exposure to such and likewise understand why this happens or people get triggered by it. Try not to let that get to you, it's not you specifically but just a growing concern as well he use of AI adoption spreads and impairs judgement..

And I don't like the idea of not having a centralized way to see and manage all my devices and services.\n\nSo either I go for a commercial NAS with a power efficient CPU and I use it like yours, or I build my own truenas sff with a N150. \n\nI'd only have services not-relatd to file sharing in a NAS if its cpu is decent enough AND I have the ability to manage them in a centralized way (i.e proxmox cluster) \n\nI'm still deciding before buying any hardware :/",

If you want your adguard/pihole pod to have a LAN IP address there's ways to do that in k8s (look up multus CNI).

It's a slice of cheese with fewer holes.\n\nThe other layers are following the advice of others in this thread and ensuring exe files aren't downloaded; and when they're buried inside archives and detected, they're automatically removed. Which is a good practice \\*anyway\\*, aside from the security issues, because it means the media you were expecting wasn't downloaded so \\*Arr needs to be aware of that.\n\nYet another layer would be running this all on a Linux server.

A program without input is meaningless, just as input without an interpretation is meaningless.\n\nThe intention is for jpgs to only describe images, but if you wanted you could write an interpreter that allowed for a fully turing complete language inside valid jpgs. Some jpg interpreters have done that in the past unintentionally. It's really easy to accidentally make a turing complete system...",

As I recall it's basically just enabling a flag and specifying a path. Don't quote me on this but if you want to use this with a NAS you may need to look into how file changes are detected and potentially do frequent manual or event-driven scans (using your own script).\n\nIn general setting up clamav is just installing it via a package manager, enabling the service/daemon via e.g. systemctl, and then configuring it via the settings file. You probably also want to add some manual scanning as a cronjob. However, it has no built-in actions per se. I personally have it ping me via notify and use a system I set up to include a button to a temporary webhook endpoint to delete the flagged file if I choose, but I haven't ever had to use it, just tested with test signatures. And personally I wouldn't want it to automatically delete things as false positives are common, but if you want a sensible automatic mitigation you could set permissions for all such files to be inaccessible to all but root and not executable.",

I loaded up the compose file, added it to DockerHand, and ran it. First impression was \"Man, this app is bare bones, but everything is exactly as needed, unclutterred and clean\".\n\nThen I looked at who wrote it. Louis Lam. The person who brought you Dockge, Uptime Kuma, RDP Portal.\n\nSometimes you see someone who has the ability to distill usefulness into a pure gold. Louis Lam does this.\n\nSo, no promotion, no AI, no requests for \"what should I do now that I have a server?\", just some appreciation for one of the Rock Stars of the SH/OSS community.\n\nThanks Louis!\n\n[https://github.com/louislam](https://github.com/louislam)",

I personally need something, but I cannot find any free/open-source solution, so I build it for myself, and then share it with you guys.\n\nIt is also a good chance to try new tech/libraries on new projects. For example, It's MyTabs, it was my first time using `better-auth` for auth. And wow! It is amazing. It is easy-to-use and the most powerful auth library that I have ever used.\n\nAlso there are actually many hidden heroes behind the scene. For example, It's MyTabs is using a Score/Tab engine called AlphaTab to render guitar pro files. If no one made this engine, my project would not be possible in the first place.",

Whatever alternative would become popular, it would need to abide by the same laws in UK for people from UK, for example. If not right now, then once the UK government comes after it.

If you add the UI it becomes a slippery slope, users will start expecting EVERYTHING to be editable via the UI and the project maintainer will most definitely take this into consideration.\n\nBy all means please DO try and open a pull request once you're confident with your codebase and functionality but I'm leveling your expectations here. I may be wrong btw, I'm just giving you my 2 cent from the dev side of things. \n\nThis is regardless very cool and if they don't accept it I'd create it as a browser extension and work in tandem with homepage, open source it and make this its own product/tool as an enhancement feature <3",

I did some tests and didn't feel comfortable with just printing rasterized images, I couldn't get it to look the same as native text no matter how hard I tried. \n\nI built a very over-engineered Intermediate Representation pipeline. Basically I have an internal language that represents how things visually will look in the printer, and then translate that to StarPRNT commands, after doing optimization rounds.\n\nIt's quite advanced, you can read more about it here [https://github.com/eljojo/estrella#how-it-works-the-compilation-pipeline](https://github.com/eljojo/estrella#how-it-works-the-compilation-pipeline) \n\nFor markdown specifically, I have a markdown renderer that takes markdown and outputs this \"IR code\" which my app then translates into StarPRNT commands. What's cool is that I also have a PNG renderer that can take that \"IR Code\" and render a PNG showing how the receipt would look like, so for example I can render a markdown to PNG by passing it through that \"IR Code\".\n\nsounds like you have a thermal printer yourself? how do you like it? have you found other usecases beyond morning news?

One or two times, complete with attributions from the original authors that the AI helpfully retained.\n\nPersonally I really would not want to release a project that could potentially have those sorts of legal/PR issues laying in wait without my awareness, because I'm very cognizant that sometimes FOSS projects end up growing so much larger than just the original author and their intentions. I would not want to leave that for somebody else to deal with in the future. Especially if I was specifically sharing it here, for starters.",

Think Overseerr/Jellyseerr + Radarr/Sonarr, but purpose-built for\n  audiobooks. Request a book, and it handles the rest: searches indexers, downloads, organizes files, and triggers a library scan. Done.\n\n## What it does:\n\n  - Plex and Audiobookshelf support (your choice)\n  - Torrents via qBittorrent + Usenet via SABnzbd\n  - Prowlarr for indexer search (torrents + NZBs)\n  - One-click requests with full automation pipeline\n  - Chapter merging - multi-file downloads automatically merged into a single M4B with chapters\n  - E-book sidecar - optional EBook downloads alongside your audiobooks (And file repair for kindle import)\n  - BookDate - AI-powered audiobook recommendations with a Tinder-style swipe interface (OpenAI/Claude/Local)\n  - Request approval workflows for multi-user setups\n  - OIDC authentication support (Authentik, Keycloak, etc.)\n  - Step-by-step setup wizard with connection testing\n  - Single Docker container - just docker compose up -d and go\n\n## Screenshots:\n\n  https://imgur.com/a/2nHmVSk\n\n## What's changed since the beta posts:\n\n  A lot. Usenet support, Audiobookshelf integration, OIDC auth, e-book downloads, chapter merging, admin approval workflows, notification support (Discord/Pushover), and honestly too many\n  fixes and improvements to list. The beta testers put this thing through hell and it's significantly better for it.\n\n## Thank you to the beta community:\n\n  Genuinely - this release wouldn't be what it is without the people who jumped in early, broke things, reported bugs, and gave feedback. You all shaped this project in ways I couldn't have on\n   my own. Thank you.\n\n## Get involved:\n\n  GitHub: https://github.com/kikootwo/readmeabook\n\n  Discord: https://discord.gg/kaw6jKbKts\n\n  The repo is public and contributions are welcome. Whether it's features, bug fixes, or documentation - if you want to get involved, the Discord is the best place to start. It's also where\n  you'll find setup help and general discussion.\n\n## Tech details:\n\n  - Stack: Next.js, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis\n  - Deployment: Single Docker container (embedded PostgreSQL/Redis)\n  - Auth: Plex OAuth, Audiobookshelf OIDC, Local Registration\n  - Integrations: Plex, Audiobookshelf, Prowlarr, qBittorrent, SABnzbd\n  - License: AGPL v3\n\n\n---\n  If you've ever been frustrated trying to get audiobook automation working with tools that weren't built for it, come give this a shot. And if you're not ready to self-host yet, come hang out in the Discord anyway - would love to hear what you'd want from a tool like this.",

Would you consider having the unified image check for these env vars at startup and skip launching the internal Postgres/Redis when they're provided? This is a pretty common pattern in similar self-hosted apps. Immich, Baserow, and others do exactly this, letting users point at external databases without needing a separate image.\n\nSince Prisma already reads DATABASE_URL natively, the main change would just be conditional logic in the entrypoint to skip the internal service startup.",

We start the request knowing the ASIN, then match release names to the given title/author (only unsure part), then the request has the ASIN attached. Then when we organize the files we create a file list hash that we compare against the files reported by ABS which allows us to accurately ASIN match in ABS. \n\nIf we just look at file names and try to match to audiobooks it leaves a lot more room for mismatches",
