Then my family started using these services. My wife relies on the password manager daily and kids stream from plex constantly. Suddenly it's not my hobby anymore, people now depend on it\n\nNow when something breaks at 11pm it's \"dad the internet isn't working\" because pihole crashed. Or my wife's locked out of her accounts because the password thing stopped responding. I spent last weekend fixing stuff instead of relaxing because I realized one hard drive failure would destroy everything.\n\nStill glad I selfhost instead of paying for cloud services but nobody warned me that once other people depend on your setup, it stops being fun and becomes real work. Now I understand why sysadmins drink.",

Do a stupid simple setup, don't tinker with it, manually handle updates instead of doing it automatically, and add very basic monitoring. For super critical things that block your family from doing day to day things (like a password manager, email), go with non-selfhosted options. Ensure your backups work and you can recover quickly.\n\nHA, and everything else is amazing in a work environment where you have a team that also takes care of setting it up, maintaining it, updating it, has enough hardware, redundant network, redundant power supply, etc etc. For a home environment with a single person that does it in their spare time, a simple setup will not only be cheaper and easier to build and run, it'll most likely be just as - if not more, stable.",

It's hard to justify securing some things but not others, especially if those critical things you chose not to selfhost are crucial to keep secret (ex. passwords).\n\nI guess the correct progression would be to practice with something low-risk (I thought I might start with a bookmarks manager), then learn and implement enhanced resiliency for that service. If it's working well and is easy to maintain, decide if/when that's worth doing for a higher-risk service, and repeat 'until done'. This would be a much longer path to freedom, but probably the safest way to avoid accumulating 'tech debt' that you're fixing every couple nights, and/or overextending yourself in supporting too many services.",

But that's a lot of time burning disks if you plan to back everything on your server up, which I'm not suggesting.\n\nEdit: clarification",

Though, the simplicity of Google Photos, and the fact that the entire family knows how to use it, is second to none. I find it worth the annual Drive storage fee just to simplify this. \n\nAlso, if I happen to die, I don't want my wife and family fiddling around trying to figure out how to get access to the pictures. It may work fine initially. But assuming something like a HDD or something will fail at some point, it could render everything useless. And I don't expect them to maintain the HDD's, or make sure everything is running properly. That's my hobby, not theirs. \n\nSure Plex is great and all, but if it quit working, no sentimental family value is lost. They would just have to go back to paying for subscription services again. \n\nI like to think my home lab is fairly resilient. 3 node proxmox cluster, where there is replication and HA for the services I want more available. Ultimately I've had no real downtime issues aside from tinkering / updates, and one minor issue with the network interfaces which I have since learned about and fixed. Things should run for a very long time, but at some point some hardware is going to fail, and if I'm not there to fix it, then it doesn't work. \n\nIt is sort of a fun thought experiment to think about how long things could run if they were never touched or maintained again.

Someone else also mentioned redundancy. Run 2 piholes instead of 1 for primary and secondary DNS along with redundancy.\n\nFor your password manager, I would highly recommend just utilizing a service like bitwarden. It's completely free and has no limitations on how much you can store on their free plans. The only downside is not having control of your actual vault file. However, realistically if someone gets your vault file and also happens to crack your master password, it's no different than someone knowing your email and just mass guessing your login info.

Good luck! PS - I just ran a quick search on the tool and found LinuxInstalll.now which I love, although a .com obviously has some extra weight ....",

          "text": "Well.... Fuck... ive been working on something like this for like 2 months in my spare time, and i was just trying to search for something on reddit and came across this. the version im making is essentially just slapping a bunch of pre-made building blocks together into a downloadable .sh file based on which options are selected, kind of like what yours and nixite does (which i somehow also failed to realize the existence of before now) It can do .jars, .appimages. flatpaks, snaps, apt-installs, .deb's and can install \\*some\\* apps from tarballs.\n\n  \nsome suggestions for improvements based on things i have in my script:\n\n- install wget at the beginning of the script, wget the .deb/other installer file, install it, and then purge wget afterwards (assuming they didnt elect to install wget)\n\n\n- you can also use wget to download .appimage files and .jar files (probably some others but i havent come accross any yet). you can automatically create a .desktop file and a launcher script and put them into the proper folders in $PATH so that they function as if they were installed as a native install. you would also have to download/install dependancies like java for the .jar files, which is pretty easy. You can also automate downloading an icon for each one to use in the .desktop file, which thats usually pretty easy either by doing a wget for a png from the website, or downloading the source in a .zip from github, and extracting the icon file from that before removing the zip file.\n\n  \n- you can do something very similar by downloading tarballs, decompressing them, and then installing its contents, but this is more labor intensive since you need to customize the commands to install each tarball based on its contents and whatnot. \n\n\n- you can automate flatpaks and snaps, since thats the only way some software is officially available, though you should probably put a small little icon next to an option to inform people that a certain program is a snap/flatpak.\n\n  \n- some programs without static links to installation files like .deb's (usually because of timestamped download links) can be easily downloaded by opening the download page in a headless firefox window, then waiting until the file that downloads to the 'downloads' folder by default is finished, killing the firefox instance, and installing the downloaded file.\n\n  \n- automatically adding application-specific repo's and doing a native install from there, since RN it seems like you're relying only on the repos offered by the OS by default.\n\n\nThe points about .DEBs, .jars, .appimages, and tarballs would all greatly increase the time and effort needed to maintain this script being up-to-date, so I could see why you might avoid doing those things.",

Not too sure if I'll ever do that, especially considering there are apparently two existing platforms/services for doing the same function im trying to do, but I'm going to finish it anyways just to prove to myself that I can. Also because I use some software that isn't present/available in either service and Id still like to be able to set up PC's with software without imaging them, so it'll still be useful to me.\n\nMy only other suggestion for your current project: add more lizards. They're my favorite animal and I think a lizard would look really good in the middle of the script. (For legal reasons, this is a joke.)",

But we work in not harsh environment.\n\nThe nylon labels work great - adhesion strong, text stays well even a user sometimes reconnects connectors.\n\nAnd the nylon labels work well on curved cable parts, much better than other tapes.\n\nBut Brady's cartridges are very expensive. Once we bought a replica - its quality was bad.\n\nP.S. I'm talking about an adhesive tape based on nylon **woven fabric**, not an extruded sheet or another similar technology.",

From the days of Claude sonnet 3.0 (1.5 years ago) up till now with the latest and greatest (G3Pro & Opus 4.5 thinking). ALL of them end up using some weird functionality, sometimes they make the code fill or \"simulate\" the data, or use outdated libraries and going as far as pinning the older library versions so their code works (missing a lot of years of improvements and potentially security-related things). Its not good for proper software at all, not even  close, but if you want to do a specific task its great and AWESOME. Note, anything that spans multiple files (i.e. longer than 2k lines) it starts struggling hard. Even with Cline and other \"AI\" IDEs and MCPs.\n\nAnd I noticed, by the time your little project is as you want or works well, you pretty much have spent like %70 of the time required for you to learn the language and do the task yourself many folds better and smoother.\n\nWhere I think it can be nicely used and integrated, is for it to notify you on common oversights (un-accounted for errors/actions), suggest for you better ways to do a task and stuff like that, it can be cool and gives you good insight. Especially when you are in the zone it can be extremely helpful as you might get too laser focused on one thing.\n\nFor example, I asked (and spent 8 hours) Opus+G3pro to create a Rust-based backend and frontend management system to download rotten tomatoes pages, where all the heavy lifting is done by me later (getting the URLs, actually parsing and dumping info) and its only task is to download the HTMLs that are provided in an XML file. It failed massively, every medium change makes the LLM change a good chunk of the code and then it properly doesn't compile/has runtime errors so you have to waste 2 more prompts to fix it. When it later works, you realize it deleted some functionalities here and there. It keeps doing this. There can be things made to mitiagate this but IMO once you need/research that... its time to stop.\n\nI did like 5 apps at this point on all langs and all types of work, all of them suck beyond doing a specific task, some didn't even do the task correctly, and you seriously shouldn't publish anything from them (without big warnings at least) from what I have seen that they do. \n\nI asked a few to create a program to benchmark jxl-rs + jxl-oxide decode speeds, and I provided them both of their complete docs and even the entire codebases, but after 4-6 hours of playing with it the result was still quite bad and unsatisfactory. On other hand, a quick 30m manual work and I was able to pretty much do what I wanted, and with another 30m-1hr it was a lot more detailed and actually had many things that were never considered... it might waste more time instead of the reverse sometimes, even with the best prompting. Though, it did suggest things to help performance that I never considered that were slightly obscure in Rust development which was cool. It also provided so much false information like \"cache-aligned\" decoding block sizes.\n\nNow, the only vibecoded program I published is a Go CLI one that downloads kick vods, I wanted it QUICK and I \"engineered\" a prompt that includes everything it needs (took me like 30 mins to get everything so it doesn't miss) and it turned out fine after like 5 hours of iterating and somewhat repetitive prompting. The tool was made as there were no alternatives to download chat and emotes which are essential for archiving. I tried it just a few days ago and it still works perfectly as I need and I was in a hurry both times, so a great thing. Of course after it was decent enough, I polished it a bit.\n\n\n\nWoah big ass wall text, hopefully helps someone.",

Then, I've deleted the BlueSky account and moved all my subscriptions there in the same RSS reader. It's awesome to have all my YouTube, Nebula, BlueSky creators, along with blog-subscriptions, in the same chronological feed).\n\n---\n\nProTips when subscribing to Youtube channels via FreshRSS:\n\n* When you want to exclude shorts from the feed, select the channel, go to \"Manage\", and in the `Filter actions` section set `Mark an article as read… \"inurl:shorts\"`\n* When you deal with channels which post way more often than others (podcasts, frequent shitposters), you can group all those channels in the same category, and then for each podcast channel go to \"Manage\", and in the `Information` category set `Visibility \"show in its category\"`. Now you have 2 feeds to follow: the \"Main Stream\" and \"Podcasts\".",

I did this mostly for Frigate, which I’m running in HA.  This has been a lot of fun, as I’ve now got various automations running based on face and object recognition from my cameras. \n\nThe other I’m moving to an N5 Pro with 5x 22TB drives and 96gb RAM (I was able to get everything before the most recent price spikes).   I played around with switching OSes, tried both TrueNAS and Unraid for a bit, but ultimately I’m sticking with OMV.  So far all I’ve moved over is my media stack, Plex and arr stuff.  I’ll be moving document and backup services over to it soon.  Then the big next step and reason for that hardware will be to play with some local LLMs.  \n\nI’m also switching ISPs and will soon have 8gb fiber which is going to kick ass, but even better than the bandwidth is I’ll finally have full control over the router vs my current ISPs super locked down BS.  So once that’s in place I’ll be setting up AdGuard or Pihole which I haven’t had in a decade.  From there I’m looking forward to exploring a bunch of other network stuff that will be new to me. \n\nHopefully I’ll be all done in Jan and I’ll probably write up a complete overview.",

          "text": "Happy new year!  This year was mainly one of learning in the self-hosted space for me, I had a couple month break while I was job searching where I really honed in a lot on learning what I could to keep my skills sharp.\n\nBefore this year, I was mostly living in the realm of debian VMs running Proxmox, that I would deploy docker compose files to.  I really wanted to learn kubernetes, so I initially started out with setting up k3s, and I eventually got my normal \\*arr + jellyfin, forgejo, and vaultwarden stack up, with support from Traefik as a reverse proxy, Cert Manager, Longhorn for storage, etc\n\nThen I heard of NixOS, and the idea of a purely declarative environment was really appealing to me.  I went with hosting my services baremetal for a little bit, and that led to learning a lot about Linux networking through configuring systemd-networkd...and I even got a cheap mini PC with dual 10G ethernet ports and setup a custom router with nftables for firewall, kea DHCP, and blocky for ad-blocking DNS.\n\nI also got a Framework Desktop with the AMD Strix Halo platform, and I had a decent time experimenting with local LLMs using ollama's ROCm support.\n\nBut then I decided I wanted to go back to the world of containers.  So I've reinstalled Proxmox on my servers, got them in a cluster with ceph, and I've got a set of Terraform modules that spin up and configure an HA cluster with Talos.\n\nThis time I really wanted to dive further into k8s stuff, so I'm doing the whole works:\n\n* cilium CNI with Gateway API support (still using CertManager with a letsencrypt DNS-01 challenge for now)\n* rook-ceph CSI (connecting to the ceph setup in proxmox)\n* CloudNativePG for replicated database\n* one of ArgoCD / Flux for Gitops\n* SSO with Authentik (which I had setup briefly in my original incarnation of the k8s stuff in k3s, but didn't get to explore the full potential of)\n\nSo far, Talos' documentation is excellent, and there are some things I didn't quite figure out in bare-metal k3s land in NixOS that I already have a better idea of for when I get to them (hardware accelerated transcoding in Jellyfin being a big one)\n\nOf course the plan is still to host my normal services, but I still have a little bit to go on the infrastructure side before I'll be ready for that.  First will be Forgejo and Gitops, then Vaultwarden restored from my backup, then the media stack, then install Talos bare-metal on the Framework Desktop.  \n  \nThere are some services I've had my eye on that I wanted to hold off on implementing until I was more comfortable with my infrastructure.  Forefront of my mind for these would be:  \n\n* Paperless-NGX for document uploads (especially potentially leveraging full-text search with some LLMs maybe)\n* Immich for photos\n* Likely tailscale for outside of network access\n\nI also have a couple smaller apps I'll be writing up that I intend to host, things like custom Discord bots and such.\n\nI've also had HomeAssistant running on a raspberry pi for a little bit, but I haven't explored the possibilities with that as much as I'd like\n\n  \nHardware is two beefy custom built servers in Fractal Design tower cases with too many hard drive slots, a minisforum ms-01 (mostly as the lighter weight 3rd node for HA stuff like proxmox cluster, ceph, cnpg, etc), the Framework Desktop.  I also have an old system76 meerkat I'll probably use as a single proxmox node to host a development cluster where I can try things out",

Hetzner is a dedicated box (Xeon W-2145, 256GB RAM) running Proxmox, and that’s basically my main compute/storage playground. The two sites are tied together with a WireGuard site-to-site tunnel.\n\nIngress is intentional, TLS terminates at the edge on OPNsense/HAProxy, and I forward internally to Traefik over plain HTTP. DNS is split-horizon and centrally managed now using Technitium, because I got tired of clicking and maintaining dozens of entries in Unbound. NFS is served using debian vm‘s with per host ACL. Technitium lives on its own vm. Authoritative for local only domains. PBS is also as a vm on each proxmox host. With remotes to a backup provider and s3 backups via Hetzner S3. Compose lives on my own Forgejo + codeberg as backup. Portainer pulls via git to deploy stuff.\n\nEdit: I ditched plex and moved over to jellyfin on its own VM.\n\nServices are split between docker hosts/vm‘s. docker1 infra stuff, docker2 media pipeline, docker3 still in the works, only stirling-pdf inside.\n\nDocker 1: Infra+little bit of observability\n- Portainer\n- Traefik (infra)\n- Paperless-ngx\n- Gotenberg\n- Apache Tika\n- Valkey\n- Paperless-AI\n- Paperless-AI (wife)\n- Grafana\n- Loki\n- VictoriaMetrics\n- Grafana Alloy\n- Beszel Agent\n- Karakeep\n- Karakeep Chrome\n- Meilisearch\n- Notifiarr\n- Forgejo\n- Glance\n- Draw.io\n- The Lounge (IRC)\n\nDocker2:Media Pipeline\n- Portainer Agent\n- Traefik (services)\n- SABnzbd\n- Prowlarr\n- Sonarr (anime)\n- Sonarr (tv)\n- Sonarr (kids)\n- Radarr (admin)\n- Radarr (kids)\n- Autobrr\n- Autobrr-DB (Postgres)\n- Unpackerr\n- Huntarr\n- StarrProxy\n\nDocker3: recent host/vm + new stuff\n- Stirling PDF\n- Traefik (home)",

          "text": "\nHere is my 2025 stack. Honestly, I try to keep it as simple as possible, though \"*simple*\" is relative!\n\n* **Komodo** – **Infrastructure management.** After 4 years of Portainer, I migrated because I was losing track of the source of truth for my stacks. With Komodo's two-way git sync, my Git repo is *always* the source of truth, no matter where I change the config. I run the Core in Docker, but the Periphery agents run on systemd, automated with Ansible and GitHub Actions so they update themselves regularly.\n\n\n* **Keerakeep & Linkwarden** – **Bookmark managers.** I find myself swapping often between these two.\n\n\n* **Passbolt & Vaultwarden** – **Password managers.** I run them both as copies of each other, as each has distinct pros and cons. I cannot pick one yet, so I'll see what kind of features they release next year.\n\n\n* **AdGuard Home & Tailscale** – **Network & Privacy.** I don't use commercial VPNs, but this combo helps significantly fight browser fingerprinting. I mainly use DoH in round-robin, and I like the results I get while browsing the web.\n\n\n* **Traefik, Caddy & Pangolin** – **Reverse proxy and load balancing.** I use each of them differently, but usually, Traefik sits in front of Caddy.\n\n\n* **CrowdSec** – **Security and threat detection.** I sometimes write custom collections to limit API usage on specific apps. I’ve hooked CrowdSec into a self-hosted **VictoriaMetrics** instance and use **Grafana** to build threat detection dashboards that track all attacks and decisions. Since the community version of CrowdSec does not keep retention, this setup allows me to keep 2 years of decision history.\n\n\n* **Teable** – **Postgres frontend / Airtable alternative.** This is my main backend data storage and smart spreadsheet (moved here after 2 years on Baserow). I use it for books, movies, Oura habit tracking, and my LLM knowledge base.\n\n\n* **Metabase** – **Intelligence system.** Hooked directly into Teable to build dashboards on the data I'm collecting.\n\n\n* **n8n & Activepieces** – **Automation.** I use n8n with custom built Python modules for machine learning, feeding them data from Teable to make predictions.\n\n\n* **Actual Budget** – **Budget tracking.** The data is hooked into Teable and N8N for analysis.\n\n\n* **Restic** – **Backups.** I perform offsite backups to S3, dumping all Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB databases daily. Everything is encrypted. I keep 12 months of full backups and 7 days of incremental backups.\n\n\n* **Ghost CMS** – **Self-publishing.** I use a dual-CDN setup. Mainly I'm with Cloudflare, but it automatically switches to BunnyCDN if Cloudflare goes down (which seems to happen much more often lately).\n\n\n* **Element** – **Chat.** Self-hosted chat based on the Matrix protocol. I don't like the Chat Control initiative, so I'm ready to switch once the law is passed.\n\n\n* **SearXNG** – **Meta-search engine.** I have this configured as the default search engine in all my browsers.\n\n\n* **NTFY & Telegram** – **Notifications.** Sometimes I push notifications to my self-hosted NTFY, but other times I use AI agents to publish them directly to Telegram.\n\n---\n\n### Things to add in the future\n\n* **Immich or Photoprism:** For my pictures. They are going to hold my camera shots only (mainly my Fuji files and collections).\n\n\n* **Book Management:** I need a decent app to migrate my non-fiction books from Apple Books (epub format). I have tons of books but no idea where to hook them up. I tried Calibre but didn't like it. Open to suggestions.\n\n\n* **Encrypted File Storage:** A decent self-hosted app for file storage to replace my Proton Drive (approx 10GB library). Open to suggestions. Precedes the simplicity and security. NO nextcloud or similar.  Must use encryption at rest and file sharing, easy upload from a mobile device. \n\n\nP.S. Let me know if you have  good suggestions for the file storage or book apps.",

It's okay; just two months of work. :)\n\nAnyway, here's my take on it. [https://github.com/jvdillon/netv](https://github.com/jvdillon/netv)\n\nJoking aside, there are some major differences between the two projects. Arguably the biggest difference is that mine does transcoding at the server. This is essential for most IPTV streams. All browsers only support a small subset of audio/video streams meaning a lightweight html/js/css only client necessitates serving on-the-fly transcodings. (This complexity is precisely why there's relatively few browser players and a variety of native apps.) All standard audio/video codecs will work under my project and because it uses ffmpeg to transcode--likely similar to Jellyfin and Emby though I never studied their code (only because I already have a lot of ffmpeg experience). However, unlike those projects, mine builds ffmpeg specifically for your hardware and the server has a probe cache system designed to speed up transcode initiation delay. (They might do this?) Anyway the elephant in the room is actually xtream API; I treat this as a first class citizen.\n\nAdditionally I spent significant effort getting CC and Chromecast working nicely. Though these are unsexy things they are important to me and either worked poorly in alternatives, were brittle, and/or poorly documented. Finally there's a few gems in `tools/` dir, especially tvguide scraping and my custom ffmpeg builder. I tested on: TitanX, 3090, 5090; support for old GPUs was also a motivation for me.\n\nEdit: There's been a lot of discussion about vibecoding. I'm not totally sure why it matters but: Yes, I coded most of this project myself \"by hand\" except for: unit-tests, README, and some of the setup scripts. Although I have been working on this project for two months, in fact some of the code I'm sharing has been a WIP of mine for literal years, going back to my MythTV days in 2013. For example the zap2xml.py (evolved from and for MythTV) and xtream2m3u.py (for Emby IPTV support) are the geological oldest scripts and are the core bits which grew into this project. Feel free to study the code for yourself and pass your own judgement--or even better: make an Issue and/or PR to make it better for us all. :)",

For example, I had to manually debug and install the python packages fastapi, python-multipart and uvicorn. I also had to manually install jinja2.\n\nAnother thing is, your [install-prereqs.sh](http://install-prereqs.sh) only works for debian-based systems, mine is Fedora, so I had to go in manually to pick this piece of code and install uv on the system, since I thought it was required:\n\nif command -v uv &> /dev/null; then  \n    echo \"uv already installed: $(uv --version)\"  \nelse  \n    curl -LsSf [https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh](https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh) | sh  \n    export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"  \nfi\n\nOutside of that,  it looks like it was vibecoded, and because of that some things in the README are misleading. For example, the link in the quick start section points to the repository \"[https://github.com/youruser/netv.git](https://github.com/youruser/netv.git)\" when it clearly should be \"[https://github.com/jvdillon/netv.git](https://github.com/jvdillon/netv.git)\".\n\nThis is my preference and use case, but port 8000 was already in use, and probably will be for a lot of people, I guess. So I had to manually go into the [main.py](http://main.py) file and change that. Maybe some of those configs could be in a .env/json file instead.\n\nThe software looks good and it is working fine for now, I need to test it a bit since I only just finished installing. I'd do some checking on the README and maybe implement a better documentation for the requirements. In the python side, you could just list all the packages needed in a single .txt file and pass that with a pip set up for auto install of everything.\n\nI'm sure there are better ways to handle that and since it was build with debian-based systems in mind, based on some of the commands listed in the scripts, I'd consider turning it into a docker container!\n\n  \nEdit: Just a tip, if possible try setting Hardware Acceleration to software by default, since people do have different hardware on their servers/PCs. I don't have a NVIDIA GPU so I had to take a look at the logs to find out that the stream wasn't  working because of missing codecs. Setting to software solved that!",

      "text": "Hello folks, it's been a month since I last posted about an update. This update for BentoPDF is the biggest so far and introduces a lot of features.\n\nBut before that I wanted to share BentoPDF wrapped, which shows what tools and what type of PDFs you guys mostly used this year ❤️:  [BentoPDF Wrapped](https://www.bentopdf.com/wrapped.html) \n\n**New Releases**\n\n**1. Revamped Compression tool**\n\nBentoPDF now has the best compression among all open source tools.\n\nBentoPDF had two compression algos: Vector and Photon. Vector has been deprecated and replaced with Condense, which is now the recommended method.\n\nI tested it across various type of PDFs with different languages, and it performs either almost on par and sometimes better than commercial ones.\n\n**2. Office to PDF and PDF to Office Support**  \n  \nNow supports converting **Word, PowerPoint, Excel, CSV** documents to PDF.  \n  \nAdded support for OpenOffice formats: **ODT, ODS, ODP, and ODG**  \n  \nAlso supports for: **PDF to Word, PDF to Excel and PDF to CSV**\n\n**3. Now supports a variety of image formats**\n\nJPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, PNM, PGM, PBM, PPM, PAM, JXR, JPX, JP2 (JPEG 2000) PSD, SVG, HEIC, and WebP can now be converted to PDF\n\nAlso supports PDF to SVG\n\n**4. Markdown Support**\n\n  \nA new markdown live preview has been added, which supports both GFM and Common Mark. Mermaid support was also supposed to be in this release, but I stashed the changes and forgot to include them lol. But it will be included in next release.  \n\n\nPDF to Markdown is also supported with embedded image\n\n  \n5. **E-book & Comic Book Formats**  \n  \nAdded support for converting **EPUB, MOBI, CBR, CBZ, FB2, and XPS** files to PDF.\n\n  \n**6. Data Extraction & AI Ready**  \n  \n**Prepare for AI**: Output LLM-ready JSON from your PDF for easy ingestion by AI models.  \n  \n**Extract Tables**: Extract tables from PDF and export them as JSON, Markdown, or CSV.  \n  \n**PDF to Text**: This performs fast text extraction for digital PDFs. FOr non digital OCR tool is recommended.  \n  \n**Extract Images**: Extracts all images while retaining their original native format and resolution.\n\n**7. PDF/A SUpport**  \nSupports PDF/A-1b,2b,3b. Please verify with verapdf always.\n\n  \nMiscellaneous Tools\n\n\\---\n\nText to PDF now has proper support for RTL languages\n\nWe also added Booklet support\n\nRasteize PDF is now supported\n\nNested OCG support is included\n\n  \nThank you again for your support! In the next release Digital Signature and true text editing will be possible.\n\nFull Release Note: [https://github.com/alam00000/bentopdf/releases/tag/v1.15.1](https://github.com/alam00000/bentopdf/releases/tag/v1.15.1)",

I hope you get what I mean. This has been going on since inception and it’s pretty bad to look at if I may, although it’s just an aesthetic thing.

I took advantage of inotify to watch the labels directory, then used MQTT to publish the image to my HA server.  ~~I use NodeRed to then save the image from MQTT to a directory that then gets moved to a folder in my HA directory (NOT www as that's not secure), and then created a local camera entity.~~  EDIT: See below.  Automation uses the camera entity path/api to create the label.\n\nReason for the workaround being I didn't want to deal with network mounts/shares.  Not sure my way is \"better\" but it felt a bit cleaner to me.\n\nEdit: Had a further inspiration to streamline things, now just using an MQTT camera entity so no more need for the second script to copy things around on the second server.",

I’m using since the beginning of the project. \n\n\\- \\[dpaste\\](https://github.com/DarrenOfficial/dpaste) - Why this not very know solution instead of the classic “pastebin” ones? Simple: this has the ability to returns urls with only 4 or 5 characters after the slash (example: dpaste.example.com/aBcDe). This is great because when I need to share something between devices, it’s very easy to remember the link. If I had the possibility of share a very long url, only because it’s very long, I would send the content of the paste instead the paste link. \n\n\\- \\[Forgejo\\](https://forgejo.org) (and their runners)- Great git server forked from Gitea with something extraordinary: the paths and the workflows syntax are the same as GitHub. Very easy to learn, maintain and improve. \n\nAnd of course nginx Proxy Manager and PiHole. \n\nWhat are yours “essentials”?",

An example is if you don't configure payments, they won't work and all users will be under the \"Pro\" plan automatically, and that section won't even appear in the webapp.\n\nAI is an exceedingly good semantic searching system, so since I built the project slowly over the week this was an easier way to figure out which environment variables became necessary and which are not.

Everyone talks about 3-2-1 (you’ll find thousands of talks about it), my take is :\n- Backup to B2 (with encryption to keep privacy) and use something that does dedupkication and keeps history (Kopia for instance)\n- Backup to an external hard drive or something like this. At your parent or friend place is ideal. \n\nGood luck and enjoy the journey",

Are they actually better than Namecheap?**\n\nMy priorities are:\n\n1. Transparent pricing (low renewal fees).\n2. Free WHOIS privacy.\n3. Good security and support.\n\nSince I’m already deep into the Cloudflare ecosystem, should I just move everything there, or is a dedicated registrar like Porkbun better?\n\nThanks for the advice!",

It’s not just way cheaper, it’s easier to use and understand for a hobbyist like me, who doesn’t have any professional experience in web development. If you need or want to do something, they always have a great step-by-step tutorial linked right in the page. I haven’t ever had to google anything or search for answers. They offer all the same features as GoDaddy and then some, but they’re not as predatory about it. I no longer get daily emails trying to scare me into purchasing more expensive products. They also include for free some features that GoDaddy charged extra for.\n\nThe best part of switching for me was that they have an easy to use tool for bulk transfers. You just copy, paste, and send it. It took me about 10 minutes to transfer 30 domains.",

How many hours of frustration and/or more serious problems are you willing to put up with to shave a buck or two a year off your expenditures?  See also:  \n[https://www.wiki.balug.org/wiki/doku.php?id=system:registrars#gandi\\_sas\\_gandinet](https://www.wiki.balug.org/wiki/doku.php?id=system:registrars#gandi_sas_)\n\n>My priorities are:\n\n>Transparent pricing (low renewal fees).\n\nIf your top priority is cheapest, go for that, but it won't be lowest total cost of ownership, and you will get f\\*cked over.\n\n>Good security and support.\n\nGood security should always be the case, but results will vary.  What about reliability and the like, does or doesn't one count that as part of \"security\"?  As results there, will also quite vary.  \nAnd good support will (almost) always cost more, though of course one can also pay lots more for sh\\*t support, but good support generally isn't free.\n\n>Free WHOIS privacy\n\nDanm near everybody offers that for free these days, notably since [GDPR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation).  But note that some registrars they may not allow one to turn *off* such protection/feature and/or publicly list one's data in whois, even if one wants/needs to (it can be an important safeguard, and there are advantages to having it publicly listed).  Likewise, some registrars (notably due to incompetence) make it rather to exceedingly difficult to get one's data publicly listed in whois even when one wants/needs to.  For the more competent, it's typically just a toggle option (and because of GDPR, etc., typically defaults to having WHOIS privacy).  And, for better and/or worse, even without WHOIS privacy, many registrars significantly limit what data is included in whois data - so that might be something to consider if one is concerned about those details.\n\nAnyway, good luck on your selction(s).  And maybe update us in a year or two or so - after you've already had to deal with the registrar(s) for a fair while, and preferably also at least multiple domains - and let us know your findings/thoughts at that time.  The wiki I have linked further above, fair amount of information on registrars in general, and a moderate number in significant detail (notably also including the downsides of many).\n\nNote also some may include an API, whereas others don't - in case that might matter.",

So many of the tools in the self-hosted community are voluntarily maintained and developed by passionate developers, pouring countless hours of time into their projects to make our lives easier and more secure.\n\n \n\nBehind every project is more than just a username, it’s a real person who is often facing a difficult time balance between family, work, or school. I know being a maintainer myself this struggle is hard. At times, the pile of issue/request tickets can be daunting, but seeing people genuinely enjoy my work and provide feedback makes it so fulfilling.\n\n \n\nA common misconception is that you need money to give back. One of the best things about self-hosting and open source is that support comes in many ways, and most of them cost nothing. Here are some ways you can give back going into the new year:\n\n* Financial **support**, if you can: GitHub Sponsors, Buy Me a Coffee, Patreon (often linked in repos or maintainer profiles).\n* **Send a message** to a maintainer describing how you use their software in your daily life. Trust me, we love hearing this‼\n* **Contribute** code to a project written in a language you’re comfortable with.\n* **Improve** documentation or translations in your native language (many projects use platforms like Weblate).\n* **Spread the word**: write blog posts, record videos, or share your favorite self-hosted tools with others.\n\nEven small gestures can have a massive impact on a maintainer’s motivation. A kind message, a small pull request, or simply telling someone their work mattered can be the difference between burnout and renewed energy.\n\n \n\nThank you all for contributing, supporting, and helping make this community thrive over the past year. Here’s to an even brighter, collaborative, and inspiring 2026 together!\n\n \n\nHappy new year,\n\nSean, [AdventureLog](https://github.com/seanmorley15/AdventureLog) maintainer",

Like you described, for many maintainers, this isn't a full-time job, it's a passion project that they're pouring their heart and time into. Getting the feedback from user's is validation that what the maintainer is doing is time well-spent and **impactful**. It breathes more meaning into the project.\n\nThanks for the reminder and what you do, OP! Need to check out AdventureLog now =\\]",

I had my container files and compose files all sorted and organized.... \n\nBut a step forward because unraid has a plugin to make backing up containers easy (stops, starts, custom location, ignore patterns or dies, etc).\n\nAnd now I have a newish NUC kinda sitting doing nothing.

      "text": "**Homebox v0.22.1 released!**\n\nHomebox is proud to announce the release of version v0.22.1!\n\n**But first, what is Homebox?**\n\n[Homebox](https://homebox.software/) is the inventory and organization system built for the Home User! With a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Homebox is the perfect solution for your home inventory, organization, and management needs.\n\n**About the update**\n\nWe have officially released v0.22.1 and at the same time are continuing to make progress towards v1 (stable). This release covers a range of hotly anticipated new features and bug fixes, including:\n\n* Added support for OIDC! (Huge thanks to [JeffResc](https://github.com/JeffResc)) We paid out $298.86 USD to JeffResc for his work thanks to your support.\n* Item Templates. Thanks to [Wrr2216](https://github.com/Wrr2216) for adding Item Templates to Homebox! Once again, we paid out for this feature thanks to OpenCollective contributors (as of writing this it's processing) $172.53 USD.\n* Improved tables - We've made significant improvements to the table layouts giving your even more control over how things get displayed. This makes the table views more powerful and more useful.\n* Markdown previews for descriptions and notes. You can now view a preview of the markdown you write for descriptions and notes. Making it easier than ever to make sure everything is formatted exactly how you like it.\n* Fixed attachments for Windows binaries (Apologies for the issues here!)\n* Clear button for selectors - Drop downs now have a clear button to make it easier to cleanup drop-downs you want to be empty.\n* Documentation fixes\n* ... And much more!\n\nYou can see a full list of changes here: [Changelog](https://github.com/sysadminsmedia/homebox/compare/v0.21.0...v0.22.1)\n\n**Note**\n\nWe are skipping v0.22.0 due to issues with a improperly tagged version previously with an immutable tag. There is no v0.22.0.\n\n**What about V1..?**\n\nGreat news! We're making some solid progress towards a v1 release, and have documented our roadmap update here: [Homebox v1 Roadmap: Update](https://sysadminsjournal.com/homebox-v1-roadmap-update/)\n\n**Follow the Homebox journey**\n\n* On Discord: [https://discord.homebox.software/](https://discord.homebox.software/)\n* On the web: [https://homebox.software/](https://homebox.software/)\n* On Github: [https://git.homebox.software/](https://git.homebox.software/)\n* Demo: [https://demo.homebox.software/](https://demo.homebox.software/)\n* Translate Homebox: [https://translate.sysadminsmedia.com/](https://translate.sysadminsmedia.com/)",

      "text": "Hi everyone, it's been a while since my last update.\n\n**Just a recap:** [**Postiz**](https://postiz.com/) is an open-source social media scheduling tool supporting 25 social media channels/platforms.\n\nYou can craft different posts, schedule them in advance, and cross-post them to multiple platforms, and use various tools to make them better.\n\n  \n[https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app)\n\nAny star would be amazing ❤️\n\n\\---\n\nMy daughter was born 3 months ago, and I felt so burned out that I thought about selling Postiz. But after a while, I suddenly found the energy to go back!\n\nI am struggling today to maintain the open-source side. Most of the PRs I get aren't **\"good enough,\"** and just checking and iterating on them is super hard (time + mentally). Sorry in advance for unanswered PRs.\n\nI do want to say that everything that I develop every day is always open-source, I have no closed-source code.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\nThere was one thing that always hit me as feedback from open-source developers I have read before: **\"Usually open-source is not as good as commercial products.\"**\n\nAnd I kind of agree with the notion. But because of that, I decided to stop adding new features and make the system as good as possible in both UI and UX.\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nI have contacted my designers and redesigned the entire post-creation process\n\n**Before:**\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/rgkw6lp1h4ag1.gif\n\n\n\n**After:**\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fpt6lhskh4ag1.gif\n\n  \n**So here is what's new:**\n\n* Complete redesign, higher quality, it doesn't look \"bootstrappy\" anymore.\n* Schedule post size increase to the size of the screen to fullscreen.\n* First post takes the entire screen; when you add comments, it shrinks.\n* Inner scroll for the posts lists and the preview, before it was scrolling the page, and made it very uncomfortable.\n* Indicator over each social platform if you exited global mode, see the small pink circle.\n* Different previews for all the major platforms.\n* Tons of bug fixes I have found on the way.\n* Indicator about the number of characters in every channel - on the global edit.\n* Remove the option to add comments in platforms that you can't add comments to 🙈\n* Media library design (UI and UX improvement): When you select multiple media items, it will tell you the import order.\n\n\\---\n\nSome other new features:\n\n* Add a new provider: Google My Business.\n* You can disable email notifications for successful / failed posts.\n* Added a new MCP and Agent to schedule posts (AI stuff)\n* Add Listmonk as a provider - yes, you can schedule newsletters :)\n\n\\---\n\nKind of funny, I released Postiz on Reddit in 2024, and this was the highest upvoted comment:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/onu85gzsj4ag1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c46b2a841b539be7801720f0a73274e3b02562c\n\nSince we released the Docker back then, it was downloaded 5.12m times 😳\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sa7gi2kzj4ag1.png?width=289&format=png&auto=webp&s=d409513989d6beb6f8185636d55249fe134291e8\n\nThank you so much for this amazing community. I hope you had a merry Christmas.\n\nAnd I wish you all a Happy New Year!!",

LOVE IT LOVE IT\n\nGetting it running takes a bit of work because of all the keys, but once it’s set up it’s a real powerhouse.\n\nThank you for doing this.\n\nAnd congratulations on becoming a father. Daughters are the best! I have two daughters and a son, and my girls always make me smile.\n\nHave a great New Year, and know that your work is enjoyed and admired around the world; for example, I’m from the south of India.",

The episode will now not play at all, just giving me a spinning circle.\n\nI go into settings and toggle on \"Offline Mode\". The episode can now play fine without a data connection of any kind.\n\nI try and go back to my home tab to download something else, but now nothing will load at all until i turn off the 'Offline Mode', even with mobile data active.\n\nIt seems a bit counterintuitive to keep having to jump in and out of settings just to watch something that's sitting locally on the device. Can it not just play without having to do that? The 'Offline Mode' seems to be acting like a secondary switch for my mobile data connection, which is odd.",

      "text": "Hi guys!  \nI wanted to share a new open-source project I’ve been working on and I’d love to get your feedback\n\n# What is Krawl?\n\nKrawl is a cloud-native deception server designed to detect, delay, and analyze malicious web crawlers and automated scanners.\n\nIt creates realistic fake web applications filled with low-hanging fruit, admin panels, configuration files, and exposed (fake) credentials, to attract and clearly identify suspicious activity.\n\nBy wasting attacker resources, Krawl helps distinguish malicious behavior from legitimate crawlers.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ct3q68txo19g1.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&s=da4f6cab21fa848b2e26c1893014ff21cfbbfd33\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kr6dnwrxo19g1.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=75464264a071d3e7cfc1d713dcb15604c34abb7c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9dcp30sxo19g1.png?width=1816&format=png&auto=webp&s=50391e085bfc569535da3da5401652726d7dc42e\n\n# Features\n\n* **Spider Trap Pages** – Infinite random links to waste crawler resources\n* **Fake Login Pages** – WordPress, phpMyAdmin, generic admin panels\n* **Honeypot Paths** – Advertised via `robots.txt` to catch automated scanners\n* **Fake Credentials** – Realistic-looking usernames, passwords, API keys\n* **Canary Token Integration** – External alert triggering on access\n* **Real-time Dashboard** – Monitor suspicious activity as it happens\n* **Customizable Wordlists** – Simple JSON-based configuration\n* **Random Error Injection** – Mimics real server quirks and misconfigurations\n\n# Real-world results\n\nI’ve been running a self-hosted instance of Krawl in my homelab for about two weeks, and the results are interesting:\n\n* I have a pretty clear distinction between legitimate crawlers (e.g. Meta, Amazon) and malicious ones\n* **250k+** total requests logged\n* Around **30 attempts** to access sensitive paths (presumably used against my server)\n\nThe goal is to make deception realistic enough to fool automated tools, and useful for security teams and researchers to detect and blacklist malicious actors, including their attacks, IPs, and user agents.\n\nIf you’re interested in web security, honeypots, or deception, I’d really love to hear your thoughts or see you contribute.\n\n**Repo Link:** [https://github.com/BlessedRebuS/Krawl](https://github.com/BlessedRebuS/Krawl)\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you for all your suggestions and support <3, join our discord server to send feedbacks / share your dashboards!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/p3WMNYGYZ\n\nI'm adding my simple NGINX configuration to use Krawl to hide real services like Jellyfin (they must support subpath tho)\n\n            location / {\n                    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;\n                    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n                    proxy_pass http://krawl.cluster.home:5000/;\n            }\n    \n            location /secret-path-for-jellyfin/ {\n                    proxy_pass http://jellyfin.home:8096/secret-path-for-jellyfin/;\n            } ",

I have a block of 16 IPs I could throw this on in my spare time OP and I'll get back with you. \n\n\nCyber security is how I pay the bills so I have some insights I can offer if you're interested. I also am a dev so I might be able to give some help there too (I haven't looked at your code just yet) so I'm kinda speaking out of turn here. \n\nI'll have some time over the holiday to throw at this.

It would be nice if for example the /database path on Krawl called the honeypotfs contents on cowrie. This should be useful also to detect advanced malicious bots (eg: a bot that scrapes for credentials and uses it to log-in in the SSH honeypot). I'll think about it.\nIf you can deploy Krawl and make some big tests would be nice, in case you do it let me know your deploy mode / insights and if you meet any performance issues. I'm very interested to improve it because I use it everyday :)",

Plus if you have RAM and/or storage already it could work out similarly priced.\n\nI think at $200-300 (for 8-16GB RAM) the ZimaBoard is good value for money and perhaps a better option than a Pi 5 for homelab use. I'd likely still go for this CWWK board due to the modularity and expansion options. I found it when researching options to make a 2U 2.5\" NAS for a 10\" rack.",

I’m just not sure about its web-facing capabilities, which is why I’m considering switching.

              "text": "TL:DR; I've never used Kavita before. Komga UI is much faster but doesn't touch the original metadata nor fetch metadata like book covers from the Internet. BookLore UI is laggy but it can edit and fetch metadata from providers like Calibre. So I use BookLore to process books for Komga.\n\nI host about 500 books on a 5yo 8th gen Intel laptop with no graphics card, 16GB RAM, and an SSD with LUKS enabled but no RAID. BookLore and Komga are run as Docker containers on Fedora 43 KDE and all books are stored locally with the same folders exposed to both programs. On that hardware:\n\nKomga runs like a 60 fps game, autodetects folders as series, does not edit metadata like Calibre or autoname files/folders or (afaik) easily upload files or directly support fractional series (Book 0.5, Book 1.5, etc.) like BookLore, does not plan to support a gray background dark mode ([workaround](https://github.com/gotson/komga/discussions/2137)). Komga names files cosmetically in the web UI based on their metadata (e.g. Book 0.5 => 1 - Book, Book 1 => 2 - Book, Book 1.5 => 3- Book); it stores changes in databases.\n\nBookLore runs like a 30 fps game. Unlike Komga, it does have the gray background dark mode, does not have black font with sepia background (it's brown for some reason), custom fonts (like Times New Roman), the option to hide all UI buttons, or a non-Docker installer. Both Komga and BookLore will detect book cover images (e.g. downloaded with Calibre) with the same name as the book in the same folder.\n\nUnlike Calibre, BookLore can edit the original metadata in place without creating its own copies of books and then name and move books and generate folders based on that metadata. This is useful if you organize everything with your own folders but struggles with more complex structures like Komga oneshots ([workaround](https://github.com/booklore-app/booklore/issues/2014) in comment). BookLore is better at fetching book covers for books downloaded with Ephemera (and embeds them into the book unlike Calibre or Komga) but can't fix sparse metadata from the upload UI ([workaround](https://github.com/booklore-app/booklore/issues/2025) in comment). \n\nBookLore doesn't save metadata edits of the previous book when moving to the next book. You must click Save manually every time. After selecting multiple books to edit metadata and reaching the end of your selection, it will not keep going like Calibre. You must close the editing window and select other books. There are probably other pros and cons. I'm not an experienced Calibre desktop user and have never tried CWA.",

It requires a separate database (mariadb), and supporting a lightweight option like sqlite would require more effort and maintenance than the developer wants.\n3. It's a resource hog because it uses Java & Spring, easily consuming 500+MB when idle. There's various ways to mitigate this but ultimately it would require more time from the developer and it's reasonable that they don't want to spend it on that.\n\nHonestly for the latter two I'm considering setting up socket activation, so at least when no one is using it, it can go to sleep.",

That's all pangolin is doing, sso aside. I don't trust that users aren't going to expose the pangolin admin interface on the internet and get hacked. Similarly I think people should learn proper nginx and not use the proxy manager, since again another admin interface I'm certain plenty of people expose accidentally.",

Then someone from support needs to fix a status, or change an email, or undo a mistake. At first they ping you on Slack. Then it becomes a daily thing. Then they start asking for access to pgAdmin and that is when my eye starts twitching.\n\nI tried the usual half measures.  \nLittle ad hoc scripts. A very rushed Flask admin. A “temporary” internal page that somehow ended up running in production for a year. Every time I touched it I was convinced I would break something else.\n\nThis year I finally decided to put a proper edit layer in front of the database and self host it like everything else in my lab. I spun up a small internal tool builder in Docker, put it behind my existing reverse proxy and wired it to a couple of views and APIs. In my case that builder is UI Bakery running on prem, but the main idea is that ops now see a simple web UI with a few guarded actions instead of a SQL client.\n\nFrom their side it is just  \n“find user, update flag, save”  \nFrom my side it is  \n“no more raw UPDATEs in random places and I can sleep again”.\n\nCurious how others here handle this:\n\nDo you let trusted users touch the database through something like pgAdmin or Adminer  \nDo you build your own little edit apps per use case  \nOr are you also running a self hosted internal tool builder of some kind in front of your warehouse and OLTP stuff\n\nI am especially interested in how you keep it maintainable over time and avoid creating a second source of truth by accident.",

Two tiers of staging environments are common in enterprises with strict change controls and strict separation of duties - particularly in the most heavily regulated sectors, like finance, healthcare, and aerospace. And frequently, one of those tiers works with sanitized data, and one tier works with as close to the same data as production as reasonably possible, or at least, with a very recent snapshot.\n\nYou have the \"regular\" staging which is the last point developers can push to and troubleshoot and run their own deployments. Here the data is sanitized and might be a smaller data set than production.  \n  \nAnd then you have the the \"QA\" or \"preprod\" staging, which operates as a dress rehearsal for production - same scale, same data, as close to the same state as production as humanly possible. Data sanitization here is a risk factor as it could mask problems that otherwise wouldn't surface until code changes reach production, so if there is any sanitization at all here, it's carefully balanced between the need to save face in a data breach and the need to accurately simulate prod so that problems can't escape testing.  Here, normally, your developers operate with the same rules as end users will on the production environment. This is where the formal hand-off from developers to operations normally happens, where all the deployment  and rollback procedures are tested, sometimes exhaustively. Devs can have limited and closely supervised read only access here under normal circumstances to aid in troubleshooting, and they can have break glass access here to help with preparing manual DB changes or to help prepare and validate a hotfix for an emergency change control mid incident.  \n  \nAnd even if you don't run QA/preprod with real production data normally, you will typically have procedures for doing a production data load when called for as part of your testing plan, or when you need developer input on something you're seeing in prod,, since QA/preprod may be as close to production as devs are ever allowed to go.",

      "text": "[Website](https://romm.app/) | [Github](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/romm) | [Demo](https://demo.romm.app/)\n\n>RomM is a self-hosted app that helps you manage your retro game files (ROMs), play them in the browser, and sync multiple gaming devices.\n\nHey everyone, we're back for another year in review! RomM has grown dramatically this year in features, apps, community, contributors, and stars. What began as a simple web frontend has evolved into a powerful, flexible hub for your ROM collection, enhanced with new metadata providers and accessible from more than a dozen apps and plugins.\n\nLet’s look back at our biggest milestones of 2025, and glimpse what lies ahead.\n\n# Major features\n\n**Hash-based matching**  \n  \nWe've partnered with two friends and members of the community, u/FlibblesHexEyes and u/DevYukine, to build powerful new integrations that validate your ROM files against known-good hashes from databases like No-Intro, Redump, and TOSEC. They've built new public and free APIs—[Hasheous](https://hasheous.org/) and [Playmatch](https://github.com/RetroRealm/playmatch), respectively—that validate the contents of your ROM files against these databases.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yj867hnam9g1.png?width=1872&format=png&auto=webp&s=344d13e84a00beb84e7680eb470dceb2087d3783\n\n**Console Mode**\n\nThe new console interface is designed for big screens and easy navigation with a controller or remote. It features a grid layout, large icons, and a simplified menu structure to level up your gaming experience from the comfort of your couch.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzfs02waam9g1.png?width=3018&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d0a0ebe530a551ddfea2f932d12c76adcd47243\n\n**Netplay**\n\nThe incredibly smart people over at the [EmulatorJS](https://emulatorjs.org/) project have added Netplay support to their client, allowing you to play with your friends on the same instance over the internet. Just set your name, create a room, and other players will have the option to join your room.\n\n# New metadata providers\n\n* Screenscraper: Metadata and artwork with optional 3D/physical cover art\n* RetroAchievements: Display your earned achievements\n* SteamGridDB: Custom cover art for games and collections\n* Hasheous: Matches games with file hashes\n* Flashpoint: Source for Flash and browser-based games\n* Launchbox: Private, local-only matching by filename\n* HowLongToBeat: Provides average game completion times\n* ES-DE: Imports metadata and artwork from `gamelist.xml` files\n\nMore information on supported providers is available in [the documentation](https://docs.romm.app/latest/Getting-Started/Metadata-Providers).\n\n# Sweating the small stuff\n\nWe built so much we can't list it all, so here are a few highlights:\n\n* OIDC authentication for most identity providers\n* UI support for 13 languages\n* DOS & PSP emulation in browser\n* Auto-generated collections based on genre, franchise, or developer\n* Smart collections based on search filters\n* Prioritize artwork from certain metadata sources\n* Alternative box art (3D, physical, miximage)\n* Faster library scans with multi-threading\n* Deeply nested folders (hacks, patches, DLC)\n* Read-only kiosk mode for public instances\n* Redesigned server stats page\n* Multiple public and private notes per game\n\n# Ecosystem of apps\n\nOur third-party developers have stepped up in a big way, extending the project's reach into new communities and building apps that make us even more useful to host:\n\n* [Argosy Launcher](https://github.com/nendotools/argosy-launcher) for Android handhelds by u/kamikazikarl\n* [Grout](https://github.com/rommapp/grout) for NextUI and muOS handhelds by u/K-Wall\n* [RomM for Android](https://github.com/mattsays/romm-mobile) by u/MattSaysProgrammer\n* [RomM for iOS](https://github.com/ilyas-hallak/romm-ios-app) (beta)\n* [RetroArch Sync](https://github.com/Covin90/romm-retroarch-sync) tool on Linux\n* [GG Requestz](https://github.com/XTREEMMAK/ggrequestz): Game discovery and requesting\n* [Rommate](https://github.com/brenoprata10/rommate): Cross-platform desktop app\n* [DeckRommSync](https://github.com/PeriBluGaming/DeckRommSync-Standalone): SteamOS downloader and sync tool\n* [RomM ComM](https://github.com/idio-sync/romm-comm): Discord bot\n\n# Community highlights\n\nThis year, we grew from 2,700 GitHub stars to over **7,200**, and surpassed **4,500** Discord members. We ranked as the 13th favorite self-hosted app in the [selfh.st 2025 survey](https://selfh.st/survey/2025-results/), and were even featured on the [front page](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44247964) of Hacker News!\n\n# What comes next\n\nIf 2025 was the year of metadata providers, 2026 will be all about apps and integrations: more clients, plugins, and supported devices, plus new features across existing platforms. This brings us to the first big project of the year:\n\n**Save synchronization**\n\nWe’re building seamless cross-device save sync so you can pick up and play on any device exactly where you left off. Register once with a predefined device profile to get a unique device ID, and our server-side orchestration and smart sync modes (API, file-transfer, push–pull) will keep your saves in sync between devices. More details are available in [the RFC](https://github.com/rommapp/romm/discussions/2199) (comments are welcome).\n\n# How you can help\n\nHere's a little secret: Console Mode was built end-to-end by an external contributor! If you have web app, database, design, or UI experience and want to contribute to our core app, we're happy to help you get set up and start planning the feature(s) you want to build.\n\nKnow any Swift, Kotlin, C#, Python, Rust, Go, or C++? Check out the third-party projects above, and if any catch your eye, contribute by fixing issues, implementing features, or popping into our Discord to connect with the devs.\n\nWe could always benefit from better documentation, improvements to the marketing site, or financial support through our [software collective](https://opencollective.com/romm).\n\nAbove all, tell your friends about RomM! It's a great way to get the gamers in your life into self-hosting, and give self-hosters a chance to rediscover childhood classics.\n\n# Closing remarks\n\nWhen we look back at everything we've accomplished this year, we recognize that none of it would have been possible without the fantastic community of third-party developers, product experts, beta testers, and users across all platforms. Your passion and love for this project fuel our own, and we thank you wholeheartedly for your unflinching support. ❤️\n\nHappy holidays!  \nThe RomM Team\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vjbp68dwam9g1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7bccf2066885072152c2a1a2e5ea8f2bd1b4c66",

I'm not particularly interested in servers/self-hosting atm (though I'd like to get into it in the future) since I have no idea how that works but you guys seem to be the most knowledgeable on Reddit about all the various Calibre alternatives.\n\nI'm just looking for a simple, streamlined user-experience comparable to iTunes. I mainly just download .epub files, store them on my external SSD, fumble through Calibre to fix relevant metadata (and remove DRM), and sync it to my Kobo. I've tried some alternatives in the past but it seemed like they were mostly designed to be connected to a server. Again my bad if this is the wrong sub, happy holidays.",

Also, it will degrade over time, the more you write on it.\n\nHDDs don't have these issues, however, they are easier to damage (from a fall or shaking for example), they can be noisy and heat up more. Also, they can get damaged with time due to reading/writing, and here lies the double edged sword: HDDs data lasts infinitely, but reading/writing will be a problem over decades. SSDs can have their data 'expire' so to speak, also they get corrupted with time, but, they can be infinitely read with no issues, it's writing that's the problem.\n\nAnd I know, you now have no idea what to think, so, I'll make it easy:\n\nRule of thumb is: HDDs for long term saving, SSDs for active memory (installing programs, games, using for memory when working on projects like video editing, 3D modelling and what not).\n\nThe main reason being the corruption over time, when the drive stays unused. Same issues which plague SSDs, plague USBs and SD cards, it's all chips instead of spinning discs, and those chips have transistors for memory, and those transistors lose charge over time\n\nIt's a heavy simplification, but correct enough.\n\nAlso, to cover CDs/DVDs, they can work, BluRays for example (BRs last longer than regular CDs and DVDs btw, with CDs being the most prone to 'disc rot'), however, they can also degrade with time, since you, at home, burn in an image which gets distorted with time, so to say. A laser burns in 1s and 0s inside a chemical layer. While at factory, when, say, they make a Blu Ray disc for a movie or a disc for a game, they basically print a layer which already has all the information, without any burning or ongoing chemical reaction and that's why, in most cases, home burned discs last a few decades while factory 'burned' can theoretically last for more than a century (as long as you keep it undamaged, of course)\n\nAgain, explanation isn't perfect but close enough for you to get a feel",

It’s: •\tFully free — no per-run costs\n •\tSelf-hosted — runs entirely locally \n•\tPrivate — your data never leaves your machine\n •\tOpen source — built on Playwright with a workflow/task layer\n\nIt supports visual task creation, JSON editing, and JavaScript blocks for Shadow DOM or complex site logic. It’s definitely more setup than managed platforms, but once configured it’s flexible enough to handle iterative scraping and account-based workflows.\n\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/mnemosyne-artificial-intelligence/doppelganger\n\nOfficial Site/Docs: https://doppelganger-site.vercel.app\n\nCurious to hear from the community: \n•\tHow do you handle iterative scraping or logged-in workflows locally? \n•\tAny tips for designing flexible task workflows?",

TL;DR: It's mostly about look and feel.\n\nI migrated from Portainer to Dockhand, and they are similar to the extent that they share common screens, such as Containers, Stacks, Images, Volumes, etc. They both let you manage multiple instances. They both let you do pretty much everything that's management-related from the GUI. \n\nIMHO, Dockhand comes across as being more streamlined and concise. I feel that Portainer has a more \"enterprise\" feel to it in that it is very comprehensive, but also feels more complex to use. Is it? Probably not, it's just a different look and feel.\n\nDockhand comes across as more streamlined, compact, and Spartan in appearance, but it packs a lot in with a logical and thoughtful approach. It has some nice features that are missing from Portainer, such as being able to prune dangling images and Containers, auto-update Containers, and other niceties. \n\nNeither is perfect, but I'm finding Dockhand to be extremely comfortable and comprehensive to use.",

This is a lifesaver if you have services you’re used to accessing via specific IPs or if your containers talk to each other using hostnames.\n2. **Sysctl Support:** Maybe I just missed it, but it doesn't look like there’s a way to add `--sysctl` parameters (like the ones needed for `wg-easy`) when setting up a container.\n3. **Settings Resetting on Edit:** Whenever I try to edit an existing container, some settings (specifically capabilities and network configs) seem to disappear or reset to their defaults.\n4. **Silent Errors:** If a container fails to start (for example, due to an IP conflict), there’s no error message. The notification actually says \"Container started,\" even though it’s not running.",

I updated the compose and tried to save and got a validation error that \"Dash\" wasn't allowed because it was capitalized... but it was already saved as \"Dash\"\n\nThe experience just felt like I was using incomplete software.  It needs way more testing and proofing before being worth any sort of \"enterprise\" monies, imo.

The problem got severely worse when I switched to Linux when the only options were vs code's SQL extension or TUI's that were hard to use. So I built sqlit.\n\nI made it so you can query your database with a user friendly UI without your RAM being eaten alive. It is a lightweight, beautiful, and keyboard-driven TUI designed to make accessing your data enjoyable, fast and easy like it should be-- all from inside your favorite terminal.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* **Docker auto-detect:** it scans your running containers for database images and pulls credentials from env vars. One click to connect.\n* **No cloud, no account:** runs entirely local. Your data stays yours.\n* **SSH tunnels built-in:** connect to remote databases securely.\n* **Security**: Credentials stored in your OS keyring, not plaintext config files.\n* **Database support:** Supports SQLite, Postgres, MariaDB,, MySQL, SQL server, and 10+ more\n* **Easy to use:** All keybindings are shown on the screen. No need for documentation\n\nBuilt with Python/Textual. MIT licensed.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/Maxteabag/sqlit](https://github.com/Maxteabag/sqlit)\n\nRight now I'm working on better auto completion.\n\nHappy to answer questions or take feedback.",

Everything through a gui. We used Chef and other dynamic inventory control to automatically add and remove monitoring targets. Zabbix was bad at that.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was the host-centric model. We already had a dynamic container deploy system. We wanted to support arbitrary numbers of monitored targets per host. This was also a problem for the Nagios/Icinga system in use at the time.\n\nWe also wanted to get away from the lossy statsd push sampling model that we had been using with Graphite.\n\nSo, Prometheus was created to replace both Graphite and Icinga with a single data driven monitoring stack.",

It works great and most things export metrics in Prometheus compatible format. Forget about Uptime Kuma - look into Prometheus' blackbox exporter instead and keep that direction of integrating everything with Prometheus. It's extremely reliable, and you only get one stack to maintain/test for your alerts.\n\nI know you asked for something entirely in your homelab, but there will always be something missing in this context - what if your internet or power goes down at home? A common way to address this part is with an external dead man's switch. Have an alert in Prometheus firing constantly (`vector(1)`) and route this one to a healthchecks.io target. If Alert Manager (or Grafana's equivalent) stops pinging this endpoint, you'll receive an alert from Healthchecks and you know either something is wrong with your observability stack or your internet/power.",

Even the newer Pis are handily beat by just about everything.  The CPU on the Pi Zero is worse.  Not even as good as what what's on the Pi 2 (but a bit better than the original Pi), which makes it very outdated now.  Even the Pi 3 can be frustrating to use these days.\n\nOh and Tailscale is pretty cool.  Have a look at Headscale too.  Headscale makes it possible to do Tailscale, except you control every part of it.  But it's hardly the only way to do VPNs.  The base technology for that is Wireguard, which is part of the Linux kernel these days.  It's fast and very efficient.  Tailscale just makes it a bit easier to access than plain Wireguard.  Do beware that this sort of VPN is kind of different from the kind you see advertised everywhere.  Technologically, they're the same thing, but practically this is more so you remote access your own hardware or internet connection from elsewhere, rather than the various reasons those VPNs offer.",

They had a good reason for it with some information about their cleanup organisation, I cannot recall it anymore but I obviously destroyed the container as soon as I could.\nMy family got pretty annoyed because every time I worked on DNS servers, they had internet issues. Like I couldn't restart a service without anyone noticing or member needing to disable WiFi and re-enable it again to fetch the new server. So for now I just connected every family-members device to either DNS4EU family or ad-block. I'm the only one who really cares about advanced filtering and manual control.

There’s no expectation for a loved one to maintain the interface once you’re gone.\n\nThe app opens up possibilities for things like periodic reminders to update your information or setting up dead man’s switches, but I guess people don’t have much imagination for stuff like that.",

(The ability to pass USB devices, etc.) And they just haven't merged it. There's about 50 comments underneath it being like wtf?!

I used it for about two years extensively before abandoning it. You could follow documentation to the T for some things and it just STILL would not work. This happened on numerous occasions for me. But it does feel much more mature and polished, yet any time you use it you can feel it's made for massive deployments. Not a homelab.\n\nSwarm on the other hand feels so, so much more accessible and easy. When it works it's magic. But it just doesn't feel very well polished and supported in many respects.

      "text": "Hi all. This is probably a fairly nooby question. I've been self-hosting a limited array of applications on Yunohost for about a year now, and I am a software engineer but in a field that is very far removed from hands-on server administration, so I don't have a lot of relevant background knowledge.\n\nMost discussions I read around various self-hosting spaces center on the idea of the home server as a \"NAS with additional capabilities\" and almost always assume some flavor of RAID. I've been puzzled since the beginning why, and whether I am missing out on some benefit from it. \n\nMy current \"specs\" for my setup are:\n\n- Applications: Nextcloud, Jellyfin, Kavita, TT-RSS (and I plan to expand to Joplin and Immich in the future)\n\n- The entire media library is currently under 1TB, I cannot imagine a scenario where it ever grows past 2TB\n\n- I am the only user of the system\n\n- System downtime numbered in hours/days in case of a failure is acceptable, but data loss is not\n\nSo far I've been able to achieve all this with a single used office minipc and a single 1TB SSD drive in it. I follow the 3-2-1 backup protocol quite strictly. \n\nI've been thinking about what benefit RAID brings in general, and what use I would find in it. The only obvious thing I see is that it protects against the physical failure of one of the drives (but not other things that could affect the physical system, e.g. power surge, ransomware, etc)... and in my case, I already have 2 backups, and with my extremely lax \"SLA\" I can afford to go out, buy a new SSD and perform a recovery in case the SSD in my server fails.\n\nSo, am I missing some obvious benefit to RAID in my case? If not - why is it so prevalent in the community and in what way do my specifications differ from typical ones?",

RAID provides uptime, so while you're waiting for a replacement drive things keep working.\n\nFor many, a few days of downtime isn't acceptable, or at least avoiding it is worth the cost of an extra drive for parity. So we use RAID. When you have large arrays of disks, adding 1 more drive ends up being a small portion of the cost anyways. But not everyone needs that, especially on smaller single drive setups where it might nearly double the cost.\n\nAll of us still need backups of any irreplicable files though. RAID doesn't protect from accidentally deleted files, cryptolocker viruses, house burning down, etc. For all of those you need working backups stored offsite.",

This protects against total loss (raid fails, nas fails, fire, etc)\n\n\\- Ransomware / corruption redundancy: Something I need to do better (i used to do this but moved to a cloud backup so have stopped) is a cold backup.

Most RAID setups focus on being able to avoid downtime by having redundant copies of data. If you don't value uptime highly and can accept days of downtime, and you can always access the site of this server within a few days, it seems like backups might be sufficient for you. \n\n\nThe only other reason that might come to mind is read speeds. RAID and cluster file systems can have very high maximum read speeds, even with inexpensive slow spinners for the data, by having multiple copies of the data on multiple disks or hosts.

I use it mainly for media storage (currently about 24TB) and only run docker containers. \n\n* Capacity of all drives in array presented as unified storage space\n* Get 1 or 2 disk resiliency with parity disks\n* Easily expand using any size disks and get their full capacity.\n   * The parity disks have to be as large as the largest data disk in the array.\n* Save power by spinning down disks not currently being read from.\n* Read performance from the array is as fast as the single drive you are reading from.\n* Write performance to the array is slower than writing to a single disk\n   * Write caches are used to improve performance, and a process called a mover will move files from cache to array in the background when the file is not in use.\n* If parity is busted, i.e. 3 disks fail on a system with 2 parity disks, only data on the failed drives is lost. Any files on non-failed drives are retained.\n\nUnRAID doesn't stripe data across disks. Each disk has its own file system. There is an overlay (Linux FUSE filesystem) that combines the folder structures across all drives to present them as a single storage space. Great for providing a lot of storage space, and using all the capacity from different sized drives, but at the expense of raw performance. A lot of unRAID folks are using it for media servers. \n\nI also see a lot of folks using TrueNAS. TrueNAS is still RAID, just done in software. It is done better than the old hardware RAID controllers I worked with years ago and can have even better performance with all the advanced caching it can do. I just don't need that performance, and the ease of upgrading capacity in unRAID is more appealing to me.\n\nIf I wanted to run multiple virtual machines or build out test labs of machines, I would need faster storage and would probably be running some form of RAID.",

All records are retained in the database. Upgrading to a paid version of Mattermost will unlock this and other Entry limitations. Migrating to Team Edition will also unlock full history of channels, but will limit what features are available.\n\nMy understanding based on the phrasing and use of the word \"upgrade\" talking of Entry, is that there is still no messages limit for personal/private instances. The Entry plan is the free business tier.\n\nBasically, it's a nothing burger for almost everyone here.\n\n[https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/faq-general.html#what-happens-if-i-have-more-than-10-000-messages-in-my-database-and-have-upgraded-to-entry](https://docs.mattermost.com/product-overview/faq-general.html#what-happens-if-i-have-more-than-10-000-messages-in-my-database-and-have-upgraded-to-entry)",

It does that every 6 hours. \n\nI have my suspicion as to why it happens but right now i don't have time to investigate. \n\nA better solution would be to have the job run every, let's say, 5 minutes, so you can pinpoint better what is happening across other containers or the host around that time but it's pointless for now due to the lack of time available.\n\nAll this stuff to say: issues are often very specific to each precise situation, it's why platform engineers, sre, etc, are so much in demand all the time.",

Use a separate monitoring container (Recommended for standalone Docker/Compose) \n\nThis is a common and robust approach. A lightweight monitoring container runs in the background, checks the status of other containers, and issues a restart command if it finds any marked unhealthy. \n\nUsing an existing image (e.g., willfarrell/autoheal):\n\nAdd a service like autoheal to your docker-compose.yml file.

Usually you need HA controller nodes and enough worker nodes. Most homelabs cannot guarantee either.\n\nSome ways that k8s itself can fail, for those who have not maintained it:\n\n - k8s cert expiration. when cert expires, k8s components can't talk with each other. You lose auto heal feature for deployments etc.\n - k8s upgrades breaks existing nodes or components. each k8s release is maintained only for about 12 month. Not all upgrades are seamless.\n - varies k8s network plugin issue. pod reachability, load-balancer issues are common. you will learn much more about network if you learn how k8s network works. Some of the best k8s network plugins are very cool and very customizable. But they are complicated and very difficult to debug if they misbehave. KISS if you can.\n - host network/firewall issue\n - stuck containers on worker node\n - sooner or later, you need to maintain k8s native storage (PV/PVC) too, which has no cheap/easy solution yet.\n\nIf you don't already know k8s, don't use k8s in homelab unless you have 3 or more nodes and are comfortable (even enjoy) learning complex things.\n\nIf you already know k8s, don't overuse it.\n\ndocker-compose can go a long way.\n\nWhen you have proper monitoring and know how to use logs, fixing a known problem won't take much time. It is when you can't locate the problem that most time is wasted. k8s won't magically fix all issues that may occur.",
