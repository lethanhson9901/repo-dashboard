I wanted to turn it into a server, but I couldn't enable USB debugging because I couldn't see the screen.\n\n**The Fix:** I used a USB keyboard and blindly typed my PIN, then connected it to Samsung DeX to view the screen and enable USB debugging.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n**OS:** Ubuntu (via Proot-Distro in Termux)  \n**Access:** SSH (automated with Termux:Boot)  \n**Tunnel:** [Playit.gg](http://Playit.gg) (to bypass port forwarding)\n\nIt now sits in my drawer running a MC server for friends.

They have better cameras than almost any webcam and even than most IP cameras. \n\nIts ARM which is getting more and more use outside of small mobile devices, and its essentially a full computer with linux. \n\nLack of IO is the only major downside, but you can still use usb hub to expand it.\n\nI mean, NASA clearly knows this, they used an old samsung phone as part of the helicopter drone they sent to Mars. I dont remember the full list of what it was responsible for though, only that they used its gyros ans accelerometer when the dedicated one failed.",

You don't want to let Li-ion or Li-PO batteries sit around for a prolonged time at either 100 or 0 percent, as both extremes are really hard on the battery if you exceed more than a few days.\n\nIf \"in standby\", modern batteries are usually happiest in the 40-60 percent range, which also makes them less of a fire hazard.\n\nMost phones these days allow for a charge limit.

And i was happy! Upgrading to Ryzen mini-PC brought me way less emotions than getting stuff up on tv box. It's completely silent (literally nothing moves with USB SSD), it eats <10W with a USB 2.5 HDD (or SSD for even less!), and it mostly comes with \"batteries included\" - WiFi, Ethernet, BT, USB 3.0+2.0 out of the box! And it can easily transcode H264\\\\H265 4K with Jellyfin! Ran a whole \\*arr, torrents, Jellyfin, Jackett, etc on that box. \n\nSure , Ryzen mini-PC is way more powerful, has way more RAM and storage, has SATA for additional drive and more USB ports.\n\nBut i still have some warm feelings bound to this box.

That's why many opt for cloud. \n\n\nMy company did an interesting experiment where the base load was handled internally and then any peaks were dynamically scaled with AWS.

Seems like a pretty typical pattern, but I know at least 3 teams here struggled with this for a while\n- The limiting factor at some point became the ingress/egress of our internal server farm (or more accurately, the LB in front of it) and scaling that was nontrivial.

Should have moved to an onprem (or AWS) solution. If you got hit by a bus, fired, etc., that'd bring down that part of production with no support, no fall back, and you could be held liable. \n\nCool as shit, though, from a geek perspective. That's awesome as hell! I love that stuff and love all those types of solutions. But, I've learned that the business is pretty strict and legal when it comes to stuff like that and they'll protect the business at all costs. At that point, they DO need AWS for everything.

If you take it down afterwards and get sued for industrial sabotage?\n\n- What is the plan if the power did stay out but it's on at work? And the execs and/or legal find out?\n\n- What is the plan if the SD card corrupts?\n\n- To add to the above, what is the failover plan if the machine were to suddenly take a power spike and go poof in a puff of smoke? Do you have a way to restore it right away so the company doesn't sue you for lost revenue?\n\n- What is the plan if a cybersecurity incident happens and IT finds out that you're running such a critical piece of infrastructure at your home? It's extremely unlikely that their insurance will cover you. Does your insurance support this?\n\n- What is the plan if your ISP finds out that you're running commercial applications on a home connection? Most do not like that one bit. \n\nPlease take that thing away from your home asap. Either install it at work or get it on a VPS provider (if it can run on a PI, it can run on a $5 VPS without issue) and hand over the credentials to your IT department.\n\nedit: I reworded it to be nicer. :P",

For example, the old Picasa program was one that would strip away the MakerNotes when it was told to write changes into the file. The only camera that I can recall that Picasa didn't strip MakerNotes from was Canon.\n\nThis is also one thing that is so frustrating about the galleries on DPReview.

I've been using Immich for a while and the metadata parsing can definitely be hit-or-miss with some camera models, so this crowdsourced approach makes a lot of sense. \n\nFor anyone considering participating, definitely heed the warning about taking generic photos. EXIF data can contain way more than you might expect - GPS coordinates, device serial numbers, sometimes even thumbnails of other photos. I'd recommend taking some test shots of random objects, landscapes, or your coffee mug rather than anything identifiable. \n\nYou could also use an older phone or camera if you have one lying around, since they're specifically looking for device variety. The more obscure camera models they get data from, the better the parsing will be for everyone. \n\nThanks for sharing this - hadn't seen it posted anywhere else either.",

Moreover we also have added Podman Quadlet support. Thank you!  \nThe new updated version is: **v1.16.1**\n\nHello everyone!\n\nOver the past \\~10 days, there have been no new updates or fixes pushed to the repository. This pause was unintentional and caused by an ongoing issue with a lost Docker account that we’ve been waiting on Docker to resolve.\n\nUnfortunately, despite multiple follow ups, the only response I’ve received so far is that there is “no update yet.” The prolonged uncertainty has been frustrating and has started to block our release and CI workflows.\n\nTo avoid further delays, I’ve decided to move forward by switching to a new official Docker account starting tomorrow. The previously referenced Docker account should be considered deprecated going forward.\n\nOnce the new account is live, normal development, updates, and releases will resume as usual.\n\nAlso I am very grateful to the community for your patience and support, especially for choosing trust and understanding instead of frustration during this, which would have also been justified given the situation. It truly means a lot and motivates me to keep moving forward.. I will keep this thread updated once everything is setup",

The rate limit issues are also why we clone various docker build components needed by the CI/CD process to GHCR.\n\nThere are unfortunately still reasons to publish to DockerHub (even if it is a PITA for us maintainers)",

I have a feeling most people find things on Reddit, GitHub, Hacker News, etc. I don't know anyone who browses random images.\n\nPlus, ghcr will integrate more nicely with your repo and CI. \n\nYou could host both and see which one people use. :)",

Say, you want to watch Lost. You can't possibly binge it each day, all 6 seasons in non stop. But if you won't, series would leave for an undefined amount of time.\n\nOr, say you want Arthur Christmas for a nice Christmas movie night. Fuck you, this movie won't be on the list.\n\nArr stack is epic in that. With good torrent trackers and ndexer(s) it can cover all your language and quality needs. If your main language is English, free streaming sites like myflixerz will cover everything that your inderxers can't. Piracy won once again.",

Something that hindered my interest in hosting it previously which was fixed in 1.21.5 (1.21.11 is current) is that plant growth, mob farms, etc operate normally in force loaded chunks (vanilla server feature) regardless of player presence. I think the idea of making the world, it's mechanisms, and its mob interactions persistent and asynchronous to player interaction is something that really makes the game more engaging. No need to AFK to benefit from the industrialization that naturally accompanies progress in the game, for example. Which is also nice as someone with a full time job 😅\n\nI highly recommend people look into self-hosting a drasl server too. You can set it up so you can have an online world that allows or disallows simultaneous offline play, \"3rd party online\" with accounts authenticated through your drasl instance, and/or passthrough to Mojang servers. Not super valuable to me but nice to make my Minecraft purchase robust to arbitrary decisions regarding accounts by Microsoft, and I can \"merge\" offline and online accounts so I can log into the same \"player\" on the server using both Mojang auth servers or my own, using different credentials if I so choose.",

Though manufacturers are locking things down a little bit (looking at you BMW).\n\nMy recent obsession is putting zigbee power control switches inside things like light switches and lamps, you can get ones that will let you wire in the power and switch separately so the switch still works via hardware (even if there's no network). My desk lamp looks and works like a normal lamp, the switch on the top works the way you'd expect - but I can *also* remote control it via HA, which means I can do things like have it turn on when i want to look at the 3D printer camera from bed.",

          "text": "As many others have mentioned Home Assistant.\n\nBut more to the point - as soon as you want anything to be tied together. So many services either don't provide APIs, or have shuttered/heavily restricted APIs which they used to have.\n\nThat means if you want to use them you have to leverage backdoors (like reverse engineered APIs) instead of official methods to do something (e.g. download an original activity file from Strava) or everything (download anything from Garmin Connect), and even then that might not be possible.\n\nAs soon as you need to have anything linked together it becomes a delicate stack of cards that's prone to braking at any moment and often seems to be impossible.  Self Hosted isn't perfect, but usually has good enough APIs to support you doing what the hell you want, or simply just picks up changes you make to files/sidecar files anyway (and allows you to directly access those files).\n\nOne example in my stack is the simple operation of Geotagging photos taken on my DSL and uploading to Google Photos.  Without a self hosted stack this would be impossible - Google haven't seen fit to allow externally taken photos to be a) uploaded easily, b) tagged with locations from Google Timeline & Google Health activities. (Let alone anything more exotic like blending Google Timeline with Garmin Connect to improve accuracy).\n\nWith self hosting that functionality has been possible, where all the sketchy limitations come down to the reliance on third parties (oh how I wish Garmin Connect allowed watches/Bike Computers to directly upload to S3-Compatible/Box/Google Drive/OneDrive/SFTP type storage).\n\nFirstly is a self written and hosted platform similar to Dawarich that takes the location data from my phone via Home Assistant (the latter calls a webhook) every 30 seconds/change; imports activities from Garmin Connect (via garmin\\_export, triggered by Home Assistant webhooks in response to Garmin Connect app notifications); and imports GPS Logger logs (car, transit, taxi) - uploaded by Folder Sync which also triggers a webhook to scan.\n\nI call this Dawarich like platform Sainz as that's the VMs name and I'm rubbish at naming stuff - it's not actually Dawarich as it started as a logger for Transit trips and snowballed from their such it now includes location tracking from Forza Horizon too.\n\nThis means I have a record of accurate (GPS Logger, Garmin) and approx. (Home Assistant App) coordinates for where I've been.\n\nSo when I go out with my DSLR, which is usually on a walk being recorded on my watch, I will already have all the locations recorded in a database by the end of the day when I get home/to the hotel.\n\nI am then able to :-\n\n1. Insert Memory Card into Tablet and open Folder Sync - copies photos to my tablet (1st Backup).\n2. A second Folder Sync pair then copies these to my NAS (and when done triggers a webhook on Sainz) - (2nd Backup) which can often take all night and longer\n3. Once those photos are uploaded the webhook it triggers scans for all the files in that scratch folder and logs to a database.\n4. Both 3. and the Activities uploads tasks queue another task to scan photos - all photos with no tagged geodata that have a location recorded within 5 seconds get written to a library folder used by PhotoPrism and then tagged with the Geolocation data (those without any Geolocation are copied anyway).  If the file is over two weeks old it falls back on the Home Assistant App location data if it's within 30 seconds (the two weeks wait is to allow me time to fix garmin\\_export issues which happen while on holiday).\n5. This triggers a library scan in PhotoPrism to pickup all the new photos\n6. Then triggers another task which uploads all GeoTagged photos to Google Photos (using rclone) and to my backup cloud storage (3rd Backup - again using rclone).  The Google Photos limitation is because you can't delete/amend/modify previously uploaded photos using their pathetic API.\n7. I also have a script which writes the PhotoPrism changes (Titles and Descriptions) back to the files, which thanks to using Rclone means those get backed up to the original photo on my cloud storage.\n\nWith all this place it also means all my Forza Horizon screenshots (uploaded to One Drive by the Xbox and pulled down with Rclone) get tagged with their in game location (not that I'm actually doing that with anything yet)",

My original motivation to even learning how to set it up was so that I could get better FPS while gaming and programming at the same time 😂. I don't do that much anymore but the principal still applies. By offloading work to my server, which has 16gb of ram and a 6-core CPU, my laptop stays running much snappier. Of course this wouldn't be an issue if I owned a really expensive laptop, but alas I do not. Old office towers on the other hand are very cheap on the used market.\n\nI should note I also SSH into the server at the same time, so I have a terminal window open beside Code Server for convenience and running TUIs and whatnot.",

It isn't particularly like invidious, because it's a GUI for your videos that you yourself have downloaded on your machine as opposed to being an alternative GUI for other videos that live on YouTube.\n\nIt doesn't have a recommendation algorithm per se, but it does suggest similar videos based on keywords and tags, which are still available on YouTube but are hidden in the GUI. And it also has subtitle indexing which makes it easier to search for videos based on subtitles. And it has comment saving as well, though that isn't searchable. I actually find the comments much, much easier to search through since they're all loaded in at once on the one page.\n\nYou can set it up to either retain videos forever, which is what I do since I'm in it for the sake of archival and data hoarding. Or you can configure it to automatically delete videos you've watched X days after you watched them. And you also define what channels it should download videos from, how many videos it should download, if you do or do not want shorts/streams, and so on. Pretty much everything is configurable, as you'd probably expect from a foss project.\n\nAlthough it's not invidious at all, I thought I'd mention it because it kind of fits OPs question (I find it considerably more responsive than the laggy mess YouTube's desktop UI is), and in the long term, once I've hoarded enough videos, I plan to begin watching videos exclusively via TA and not on YouTube itself. Sadly I don't think I'll be able to entirely escape YouTube/google, because you do need to supply a cookie if you want to watch age restricted or members only videos (of you have a channel membership). But at least I'll get a say in how and what videos I want to watch\n\nThere's no algorithm though. It does have APIs, so I suppose there's nothing stopping you from making your own, maybe that's the sort of thing a small, locally hosted, AI model would be good for. But nobody has done anything like that as far as I'm aware (truthfully probably intentional - a lot of people want to get away from algorithms anyway)",

Hudu's GUI looked the best, but I'm really the only one looking at it lol so that part didn't matter to me. Oh, and  IT Flows simplified backend maintenance is great too for troubleshooting quick small problems (like why cron email job didn't fire off, etc).\n\nI've used IT Flow for years for my small IT Firm, supporting many local businesses, their individual assets (you can log notes, IP's, log network layout and passwords etc) and the software does an incredible job as a CRM + way more. If it helps to mention, I used InvoiceNinja (which was also great) before that, but the invoicing alone wasn't enough.\n\nAlso, is it too late to add OPNsense?  It handles all my dns stuff, traffic, and unbound is setup to as my adguard / pihole.  So no need running extra instances of an adblocker. Plugins galore, stable, well maintained, helpful community as long as you don't mention pfsense (lol). Incredible.",

TLDR: keep a copy of your docker volume AND create a sqlite backup for good measure. \n\nPersonally I have 2 physical copies on an external disk of the whole docker folder i've set up, plus an encrypted offsite backup on a VPS. I should be golden with the 3-2-1 backup strategy rule. (Edit: oh, and I have borgbackup set up, so my backups are actually incremental, deduplicated and compressed. So I could easily roll back to a specific date in the event that my data has been corrupted (say, I get crypto'd))\n\nALSO, as you mentioned, password is rather critical, so I have a monthly calendar reminder where I manually export the Vaultwarden database (from the Web UI under Tools) in a JSON file, and here's the kicker: KeepassXC can create a new password vault USING Bitwarden's exported JSON. So I end up having a Nth backup methode of my main password vault as a good old kdbx file; I keep one copy on my cellphone for example.",

          "text": "At least to me it sounded like you're actually asking for two categories.  Self-hosted FOSS software that's better than proprietary competitors in terms of the quality of software...  And situations where even if it's the same software there's a tangible, non-philisophical, non-hypothetical benefit to self-hosting vs using the paid, external form of a service.\n\nFor me the real standout standout \"I wouldn't even bother with an external service, this is the only way this product works for me\" categories are having a good media server and good password manager.\n\nMedia server:  Selfhosting a media server cuts down on network load since all those bits are flying between server and client on a local network, vs everyone in your house streaming from the internet and clogging up your internet connection.  Plus self-hosted media servers are going to let you install whatever plugins you want for customizing what \\*you\\* want to use a media server for:  Listening to music on the bus or watching movies in 4K glory at home.  Won't inject ads at arbitrary, algorithmically determined but utterly stupid points in the show/movie the way some streaming services do.  Obviously when you compare vs a streaming service like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video there's a huge tradeoff in terms of library size and effort of library curation, but at the same time if the movie I want to watch is on my jellyfin server and on Amazon Prime Video.... Jellyfin is going to be the higher quality, no-ads experience.\n\nPassword manager:  I guess for me this is more about hypothetical situations and peace of mind and less about compared featureset, since I self-host vaultwarden and I could easily just replace it with a free tier bitwarden account with feature parity.  But over the past few years the number of data breaches of password managers has been *daunting*.  And I get that they store everything in encrypted blocks and yay for them, but those encrypted blocks are paired with email addresses that have probably lost a multitude of passwords in *other* data breaches available on the dark web.  I just don't even want to deal with any of this.  My vaultwarden instance and the  internet are completely unaware of eachother.  I tailscale in when I need to access it from the bitwarden app on my phone.  I'm not quite so naive as to think I've built an impenetrable fortress, as so many of those have been breached.  But I've at least raised the difficulty way past what breaching it would be worth, and for a password manager it needs to stay that way.",

Context here matters, so I'll continue. \n\nYou go into features or experiences.\n\nBeing in control; in more ways than one.  My data, my rules. I don't have to worry about strangers (developers, maintainers, random contractors, 'advertising partners') slurping up my information, leaking sensitive information, or selling out to advertisers.  This is a big deal for me, as I've grown up relatively secure with the mindset that the internet is the wild-west and don't carelessly share things with internet strangers. Many of these big cloud services are nothing more than big strangers.\n\nCost savings.  This is hard to always quantify... but some things on the internet are simply too expensive to justify paying someone else to do it. Dropping $300-400CAD on a 'new' mini PC could theoretically pay itself back in less than a year depending on what you run.  Buying 'used' or repurposing old gear really only needs replacement parts and power to be considered... but I'll gladly 'waste' 10-20Watts hosting something myself.   \nThis holds true for me with storage as well... I could self-host 42TB at a rate of $5.16CAD/mo if I want it paid back in 12 months... I could triple this deployment and self-host mirrors at family/friend locations and pay it back over 3 years.\n\nWhere cloud providers excel (in my opinion) .. is where you either \\*can't\\*, or \\*don't\\* want to own your own hardware or service.. Short-term use items are perfect use-cases for cloud.  Use it, pay monthly for a bit, then walk away... be careful though... there's nothing more permanent than that which is supposed to be temporary.  \nEmail is one of those things that can technically be done, but the cloud giants have really made it difficult to do this without ending up on a dozen different block-lists.  Email is a tough one to justify either way... but it's becoming increasingly more important with the trends in the internet... verify your ID / age to participate in chat, social media, etc.. Combine this with the fact that many online services don't have proper sign-in authentication/security and heavily \\*rely\\* on email addresses to send you sign-in codes or magic links... loose your email for whatever reason and you loose more than access to some forums and a couple video games... even if you have credentials for sites, an increasing number will email you anyway when you attempt to sign-in.",

          "text": "I have yet to find any music streaming service with a better interface than Plexamp. Of course self hosting music streaming and subscribing to music streaming are drastically different when it comes to WHAT you listen to, but the fact that my self-hosted library is easier to navigate in an app that has better features than any of the paid ones blows not only my mind but the minds of lots of friends I show it to. And since I control what's on it, I can put my own band on it or anything else I record. I can rip demos and other stuff that local bands from my youth recorded and self-released in tiny quantities, which is a huge plus, because that stuff will never be on any streamer. I have explicit versions of albums that many streamers only have in radio or otherwise censored edits as well. So for me, self-hosting my music and rediscovering albums I bought as a teen is absolutely mind blowing.  \n\nI also love actually just having network shares, which isn't strictly in the same category as other \"proper\" sevices I have, but literally just having folders accessible from the phone, my PC, my laptop, my steam deck and being able to share files with family through a dedicated LAN share blows any cloud storage out of the water.",

Others already mentioned jellyfin and the *arr stack. I just throw Audiobookshelf in there. It's a selfhosted platform for managing and listening to podcasts. Although podcasts are free (that's also how this server sources the podcasts) apps like Spotify or Apple Podcasts have annoying ads and try to make you listen to stuff you don't want. Also Apple Podcasts is censoring heavily the decription and notes of every podcast without letting you or the hosts know.\n\nSmarthome. Clouddevices are privacy nightmares and security hazards in every private network. Do yourself a favor and don't let them connect to the internet. Just control them via HomeAssistant.\n\nArchive. I'm using Paperless to digitalize, categorize and archiving documents. Extremely helpful at somehow surviving the bureaucratic madness in my country. Just throwing them into folders on google drive or dropbox would insane.\n\nBut most of the time selfhosting is not about receiving a better or cheaper service, most of the time it's about freedom, privacy and knowing they cannot pull the plug tomorrow.",

This way, they largely function as each other's backup, with only the most recent changes on one machine not yet being present on the other. Furthermore, my desktop contains a second hard drive (an old, slow, rotating one) with a third copy of everything I consider worth backing up.\n\nThere are some ways in which I could improve on my data security, of course; like:  \n* None of my partitions is encrypted, so data can get stolen along with the computer it's on (provided that the thief is a Linux expert).

Look forward to trying it.\n\nMy only piece of advice would be to add a disclaimer somewhere in the README that it was developed with Qwen/AI Assistance.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I think every developer should be using AI tools to help with development. I use it myself via Claude Code. They’re a fantastic productivity booster when used under supervision/with manual code review.\n\nBut for the time being I do think it should be disclosed.  AI still makes tons of errors and if your users know ahead of time they can pay a little closer attention.\n\nCheers",

I did mine with Hetzner (not being paid by them to say this, nor do I have any relationship with them besides being an ordinary customer. Im not endorsing them or implying anything about them other to say that they unblocked port 25 when i asked and that their VPS was able to successfully pass email traffic without issue) and it did work but as all things your mileage may vary. \n\nMail in a box was nice because it was basically just a glorified wizard to install the email server, all the way down to automatically provisioning certs through LE. when it finished it spat out a list of all the weird DNS records that email requires to function securely and properly and from there I was able to throw that list into CloudFl@re (my public DNS provider) and fuhgeddaboudit. \n\nthe two remaining caveats with that is that MiaB has a default 10 minute spam greylist, which makes receiving 2FA codes via email very difficult as they sit in purgatory for 10 minutes before hitting your inbox, and the other caveat was that it took a small amount of convincing to get Gmail to accept email from MiaB without dumping it into the recipient’s spam hole. there was a way i was able to like register myself with gMail or something as a trusted email server but i cannot remember what it is. \n\nall in all, when i did it, MiaB took about two hours of work to go from “just sshed into the VPS for the first time” to having gmail successfully receive mail from my server. \n\nit did work pretty well, was fairly easy for me, and seemed to be secure enough out of the box. that being said, im in agreement with the other users that for personal email it’s better to just register a custom domain and use Google Workspace or Exchange Online or something. self hosting is arguably super worth it for a ton of things but there’s almost nothing that a self hosted email server can offer that an inexpensive commercial business email service cannot. \n\ni still have my MiaB server though and for those of us who frequent r/homelab and rely on Exchange Online, MiaB is super useful for SMTP alerts for your other self hosted things, especially since basic SMTP AUTH is being deprecated far faster than many open source projects are able to implement modern authentication protocols instead",

But if my email server ever went down, I would not do it again. Too much work. Especially when you want your server to be able to send/receive from external email services like Outlook, Proton, and Google Gmail. If so, then your records must be in perfect working order.\n\nAnd if the server IP you are using happens to be on any spam blocklists like Spamhaus, you're in for a difficult ride. Or if you're trying to host email from a home ISP, which blocks certain ports like 25.\n\nLike I said, it was a good learning experience to understand the process and how it all works. But to do it just to get email? No. No way.\n\nMine is still working to this day, and I'm in good standing with the spam companies, and I can send/receive to or from any service.

Now we don't, do you really think they aren't going to just do whatever they want with that data regardless of what the law says now? They will vacuum that up in mass to find people to target. Granted I'm not going to use email for anything where security is critical because it's not secure even in my home. Even the mundane stuff has value we've not considered though. My email is also my shared contacts, calendars, tasks....\n\nI self host file syncing services for exactly the same reason. I don't do social media, reuse usernames/passwords, post anything potentially self identifying. I don't have camera's at my house that send anything to the cloud.

Unlike TV/movie streaming which has become so fragmented and requires either juggling subscriptions or paying for an obscene amount of them to watch all the content I want; Music is still a fair price. I’m happy with the music streaming service I use, the price seems fair, and I get all the music I want to listen to in a single service. Very much like streaming was for years before I started uh… obtaining my TV/Movies elsewhere. \n\n2. E-Mail. Just not worth the headache. \n\n3. Password manager. Too high risk. Plus it gives me a completely separate source of environment variables combined with a private GitHub repository for everything. This creates paranoid levels of separation where both services are needed to re-create my homelab services. But it can still be done with minimal effort if I had a catastrophic failure that necessitated a clean new install of everything. \n\n4. VPN. I could pay for a cheap VPS and run headcale or wireguard. But Tailscale is free and works great. There are solid arguments for self hosting here. But for me, homelab services are all about either saving money, or doing things that cannot practically be done with cloud services. I’m not actually someone who is “opposed” to the cloud. I just don’t want to pay for services that don’t give me value commensurate with the price. So this is an area where Tailscale works just fine so there’s no advantage *for me* to host on my own. Similarly I use another VPN provider to watch blacked out live sports. \n\n5. Cloud storage. I definitely have storage IN my homelab but I pay for cloud storage for an off-site backup rather than hosting my own offsite backup in some other location. I pay for both a bulk storage provider for backups, and iCloud. I absolutely could cut out iCloud and use something like Immich, but it’s $3/mo and super convenient.",

Spotify did not make a profit once until a recent quarter since its existence, and people don't like how they did it - paying artists less, removing content, and raising prices. Fundamentally, the streaming model doesn't make sense, but investors keep shoving billions into it, so we don't know what an actual realistic market environment looks like for it, or that it is viable at all. \n\nMusic streaming is more fragmented now than it was 5 years ago, and I suspect it will get worse as investors stop shoveling into the money furnace. \n\nOne reason why it is becoming more fragmented is that musicians are getting wise to the ploy. They're refusing to put their music on streaming services because it pays almost nothing, and instead opting to sell music digitally on platforms like Bandcamp and Qobuz, or selling physical releases on CDs, vinyl, or cassette direct to consumer.",

And some people are almost morally against using a third party for anything. I completely get, empathize, and appreciate *both* points of view. That's just not the camp I'm in, personally.\n\nWhen things don't make sense, I know enough and have enough tech skills to make it make sense myself. But when things do make sense, it doesn't bother me at all to use them.\n\nA self-hosted VPN is not outside the realm of my abilities but it takes time to setup, it's a bit more fragile, it would add cost, and it would add maintenance/troubleshooting headaches. There's just no real advantage of it, for me and my use case, over just using tailscale. Which I have used for a number of years now, haven't paid a dime for; and frankly don't need to touch beyond initial setup on a new machine.\n\nI especially love the subnet router feature. I mean it's practically a single line command on a Raspberry Pi Zero in my RV so that I can access that entire network (including a miniPC and some other components there, too) from my house if things are misbehaving. Yes, that can absolutely be done self-hosted. But why? What's the advantage for me? What's the benefit for me? I haven't come up with one. \n\nIt's basically a \"Why did you do less work when more work was an option?\" question for me.",

A handful of samba shares for various things beyond just media. Photography is a hobby of mine and I use Lightroom for editing. Lightroom has a neat feature where it creates local proxies of files you're editing; so I have that on a local nVME drive but store all of the actual raw photos on a spinning drive ZFS pool.\n\nAnd then there's a few things I've built myself. For example, I live a couple of miles from a theme park that I visit often. But I can literally see it from my house, I can go anytime I want, there's no reason to go when there's a crowd there. There are tools like Queue-times to estimate wait times but it's not very precise. Turns out the parks radio dispatcher transmits their actual attendance numbers once per hour over their two-way radio system. So I setup an SDR and have faster-whisper running in a container to transcribe it, PostgreSQL database setup to store all of those transcriptions, and some scripts in Python to parse the actual attendance counts all so that I can just look at my phone real quick and see if it's busy or not. But with actual numbers. (I'll be the first to admit; that's next to useless. It's more that I wanted to tinker and figure it out.)",

Another useful thing i did was write a written plan for if my house burns down or if my server explodes one day and how to go abt recovery in those cases. Either way, having redundancy is what makes me rrust that my docs wont let me down. So id say if you dont trust yourself not to nuke it, plan for if you did. Although not having a buddy whose also into self hosting can raise issue, if you drop a sneaky mini pc at a relatives house you could backup to there. But if you dont have anyone uou can trust with a server or who is okay with it, i understand not wanting to self host that",

I'm not talking about non-authoritative DNS only used for your own clients, e.g. PiHole. It used to be necessary to run your own authoritative DNS to get some types of DNS which the registrar or ISP would not offer, e.g. AAAA, SPF. These days either they are well supported, or the standards have specified ways to encode the information in TXT records. Since you still need to go to the ISP to get rDNS, it's usually easier to get them to do the whole job.",

Your outbound mail gets the relay's established IP reputation instead of fighting from scratch with residential/VPS IP ranges that are pre-emptively blacklisted.\n\nThe trade-off is philosophical more than technical: at that point, you're self-hosting the *storage and IMAP/webmail side*, but your outbound path still runs through a third party who can see metadata (and potentially content, depending on your threat model). For most people that's a totally reasonable compromise — you get the privacy of not having Google reading your inbox while still having reliable delivery.\n\nI run mailcow with a relay for outbound and it's been rock solid. The only thing I'd add is that some relays (especially free tiers) will suspend your account quickly if anything looks even slightly spammy, so make sure your DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) is bulletproof and monitor your sending patterns.",

My daughter has discovered so much music over the last 6 months and I don't want to take that away from her. I cannot replicate that unless I have the equvelent library to spotify. All that work is going down the drain but it was fun. I was able to resorect all of my old utunes music. I think I'll send them all over to spotify as a playlist. But in the mean time I'll use plex/plex amp to head down memory lane.",

The sweet spot IMO is owning a custom domain for your email and using imap so you have a local backup of your mail.\n\nThe main thing with email is that it’s a two party system, and whoever is hosting email for your correspondents will see the messages, so the privacy angle is much lower than other services. At the same time, spam filters perform better with more data, and deliverability will be more reliable with a major host (yes, there are things you can do to mitigate most deliverability issues so for a lot of people this might not be a huge factor, but if it matters it always favors the existing providers). If you own your domain you minimize the risk of platform fuckery because you can just point your mx record at a different host.\n\nSecurity is a factor too. A lot of big platforms are terrible at privacy but good at security, and far too many services have zero safeguards if your email address is compromised.\n\nOverall: self hosting email is technically feasible, moderately risky, and has very low to negative ROI so it’s not really worth it.",

We've tackled the duplicate book problem once and for all, built a sick stats system that actually shows you how your library is being used, added dynamic/Magic Shelves, and a powerful & robust new OAuth system. The amount of new features and fixes in this release is incredible. This is the biggest, most community-driven update CWA has ever had and I'm very grateful to everyone that helped work on it.\" - **CrocodileStick**\n\n**If you enjoy the project and want to support the coffee fund for v5.0.0, you can do so here:**\n\n[Support the project here on Ko-Fi!](https://ko-fi.com/crocodilestick)\n\n# Release V4.0.0 Changelog\n\n# 🚀 Major Features\n\n# Here is the highlight reel:\n\n* **🔍 Smart Duplicate Detection & Resolution:** A completely rebuilt hybrid SQL/Python engine. It detects 95% of duplicates other systems miss (ignoring articles like \"The\", fuzzy matching, etc.). Includes **Auto-Resolution** to merge books automatically and **Scheduled Scans**.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/udmjcnu2yagg1.gif\n\n* **✨ Magic Shelves:** Dynamic, rules-based collections. Create shelves based on tags, ratings, series, or publication dates (e.g., \"Rated 4+ stars\", \"Published in 2024\"). **Bonus:** These sync directly to Kobo devices!\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z0co4j24yagg1.gif\n\n* **📊 Deep Stats Centre:** A brand new dashboard. Track **User Activity** (reading velocity, top users), **Library Stats** (format distribution, language), and **Peak Usage Hours**. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/i99zx0t4yagg1.gif\n\n* **📧 Auto-Send to eReader:** Set it and forget it. New books can be automatically emailed to your Kindle/Kobo/eReader immediately upon ingest, with smart delays to allow for metadata fetching first.\n* **🛡️ Robust OAuth Rewrite:** Completely rewritten authentication. Now supports **LDAP, Reverse Proxy (Authelia/Authentik), and OIDC** natively with auto-user creation. No more redirect loops.\n* **✅ EPUB Fixer 2.0 (No more E999 Errors):** Specifically targets Amazon's strict rejection criteria. Automatically fixes language tags, XML declarations, and broken CSS so your Send-to-Kindle works reliably.\n* **🏷️ Auto-Metadata Fetching:** CWA can now automatically fetch metadata (Google Books, Kobo, Hardcover, etc.) during ingest or before sending to a device.\n\n# ⚡ Performance & Quality of Life\n\n* **Performance Overhaul:** Search is drastically faster, and we’ve moved to WebP thumbnails which reduces page weight by 97%. Large libraries (50k+ books) load instantly now.\n* **Network Share Mode:** Running on a NAS/Unraid? We added a specific mode to handle NFS/SMB locking issues to prevent database corruption.\n* **Better Kobo Integration:** Improved sync reliability, annotations, and a new \"Featured Products\" endpoint.\n* **Hardcover.app ID Fetch:** Automatically links your library to Hardcover for better tracking.\n* **Enhanced Manual Sending:** Want to send a book to a friend? You can now type in any email address on the fly to send a book without creating a user account.\n\n# 🔗 Links\n\n* **Full Change Log:** [Link to GitHub Release/ Changelog](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/releases/tag/v4.0.0)\n* **Docker Hub:** [Link to DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/crocodilestick/calibre-web-automated)\n* **Repo:** [Link to GitHub Project Page](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated)\n\n# Upcoming changes 🔮\n\nMajor changes are still coming to CWA including:\n\n* A brand new Svelte based Frontend. The days of the current Bootstrap UI are numbers and migrating to Svelte ensures that the new UI will still be easy to edit and add to for as many contributors as possible due to it's very familiar syntax to traditional sites and can be compiled with Capacitor for native mobile apps which is very exiting\n* A new web reader, epub.js is a little dated now and there are now much better alternatives\n* A much more robust & powerful progress syncing system that will be able to have CWA act as a single source of truth for reading progress no matter what device you read from\n* Full Text Search functionality\n* 🐁 is coming very soon, the integration just had to be as sensible & respectful to the 🐁 and it's servers as possible and a good balance has now been reached\n\n**A massive thank you to the 60+ contributors who helped test, translate, and code this release.**\n\n**TLDR: CWA now has a new, robust OAuth system, a new smart Duplicate Detection & Auto-Resolution system, a brand-new & very powerful Stats Dashboard, Auto-Send to eReader functionality as well as Automatic Metadata Fetching, a new and Improved Automatic EPUB Fixer service, a new Network Share mode for increased compatibility & reliability with NFS & SMB shares, a major performance overhaul making the whole service more lightweight than ever and so much more!

Keeping a big Calibre library clean is usually just pain and vibes, so having something that actually does fuzzy matching and scheduled scans is huge.\n\nReally like the direction with Magic Shelves and the stats centre too. That’s the kind of stuff that makes a self hosted library feel like a “real” product instead of just a folder of epubs with a UI stapled on. Also appreciate the Network Share mode callout, feels like half the issues in r/selfhosted are “NFS did me dirty again.”\n\nCurious about the Svelte frontend plans: are you aiming to keep things editable for people who just want to tweak templates and CSS, or will it mostly be for folks comfortable building and compiling the app?\n\nEither way, this is the kind of update that makes me want to blow up my current setup and redo it properly.",

As to Svelte, one of the main reasons for choosing it was that it's the most community friendly modern framework available since all of it's syntax is almost identical to normal html, CSS & JS with a few \"runes\" sprinkled in here and there so it should be easy for people to pick up and keep making changes to.

      "text": "This little side project of mine launched all the way back in 2021, at the height of the pandemic, and while I counted it to good timing back then, it wouldn't have lasted this long if there wasn't a real need from the community.\n\nSince then, Reactive Resume has helped almost 1 million users create resumes, helped them get the careers they wanted and helped students jump-start their applications.\n\nThis new version has been in the making for months, I try to get time to work on it whenever there's a weekend, whenever I can physically pull an all-nighter after work. It's a culmination of everything I've learned over the years, fixing all the bugs and feature requests I've gotten through GitHub and my emails.\n\nFor those of you who are unaware of this project, and nor should you be, Reactive Resume is a **free and open-source** resume builder that focuses on completely free and untethered access to a tool most people need at some point in their life, without giving up your privacy and money. In a nutshell, it’s just a resume builder, nothing fancy, but no corners have been cut in providing the best user experience possible for the end user.\n\nHere are some features I thought were worth highlighting:\n\n* **Improved user experience,** now easier than ever to keep your resume up-to-date.\n* **Great for single page or multi-page resumes,** or even long-form PDFs.\n* **Easier self-hosting** with examples on how to set it up on your server.\n* **Immensely better documentation**, to help guide users on how to use the project.\n* There’s ***some*** **AI in there too**, where you bring your own key, no subscriptions or paywalls. There's also an **agent skill** for those who want to try it out on their own.\n* **Improved account security** using 2FA or Passkeys, also add your own SSO provider (no more SSO tax!).\n* **13 resume templates**, and many more to come. If you know React/Tailwind CSS, it’s very easy to build you own templates as well. Also **supports Custom CSS**, so you can make any template look exactly the way you like it to.\n* **Available in multiple languages**. If you know a second language and would love to help contribute translations, please head over to the docs to learn more.\n* **Did I mention it’s free?**\n\nI sincerely hope you enjoy using the brand new edition of Reactive Resume almost as much as I had fun building it.\n\n**If you have the time, please check out** [**rxresu.me**](https://rxresu.me)**.**  \n**I'd love to hear what you think ❤️**\n\nOr, if you’d like to know more about the app, head over to the docs at [docs.rxresu.me](https://docs.rxresu.me/)\n\nOr, if you’d like to take a peek at the code, the GitHub Repository is at [amruthpillai/reactive-resume](https://github.com/amruthpillai/reactive-resume).\n\n***Note:*** I do expect a lot of traffic on launch day and I don’t have the most powerful of servers, so if the app is slow or doesn’t load for you right now, please check back in later or the next day.",

I actually like doing bullets, 3 bullets...one to show strategic/critical thinking, one to highlight technical. One to highlight your ethos. \n\nBecause of the layout with 'skills' and 'experience' left justified you massively shrink the width of the area where you write your experience. Which means  it appears way longer than it is.\n\nYour skill section is wild. Like good on you for being familiar with such a broad tech stack, but it overwhelms. Unless they call our a specific technology you can cut tons out of this section. Example: Databases....then you list like a million flavors of SQL. You could simplify it to databases: sql/nosql/graph/whatever. Or even more. Just say database management.\n\nYour bullet points are also too wordy and contain lots unnecessary fluff that dilutes your message. You only include 'impact' as the last bullet when it should be in every bullet. None of it is really tangible...example:\n\n> Acted as a key full-time on-site technical resource, collaborating directly with Tier-1 consulting partners (\"Big 4\" and big consultancy companies) and the client's internal teams to align on solutions and accelerate project delivery.\n\nCan be simplified to:\n\n> Accelerated delivery by x% through technical and functional alignment between Big 4 partners and internal teams.\n\nCaptures hard value. Strips out the fluff. \n\nYour certificate section is kind of crazy. Listing 14 Salesforce certs? Don't do that. Just say something like:\n\n> Salesforce subject matter expert with 14 active certifications, encompassing the full technical stack.\n\nReally its not bad. You have the experience. Tighten it up and make it punchy. Get rid of some whitespace. \n\nMy 2c.",

Be extra sure to document anything bank or finance related. \n\n- document day to day chores that break the house if not done properly or get you in trouble with the government that only you do (like how to clear the Central hvac filters or how to do taxes)\n\nTech stuff:\n- regularly backup any important data to preferably ONE external hdd and make use it is stored in a simple file system. That means scanned documents, pictures, perhaps phone backups, documentation and digital instructions. You should not expect your SO to do anything more than plug it in her laptop, browse and double click. Presumably tech and self hosting was your hobby and not hers. \n\n- make it so any custom hardware can be simply unplugged (routers, switches, servers etc).

          "text": "I'll share my method with you; I'm not sure if it's the best, but it might help: I ​​keep my usernames and passwords in a plain text file so they're easily readable on any system. I periodically make a copy in Proton, which has been less disappointing so far. If something better comes along in the future, I close Proton and continue using the new system. The advantage of using plain text is that it takes up much less space than formatted text or a database (provided it's easy to read), so I don't have hosting problems (unless Proton, like any commercial company, decides to change its service in the future). I also periodically print a copy and save it in a folder that will be available when I leave. I destroy previous printouts.\nI try to update the text file from a single device, from where I also upload it to Proton and then delete it from the same device where I made the changes. This is because, among other problems, I'm losing my memory and I don't want to modify something on one device and then delete it or make it worse on another.\n\nFinally, I made a printed copy of everything I wrote to you (in summary) and laminated it, to remind myself in case I forget, and for my daughters and son when I'm gone.",

Or rather would setting up Usenet help bridge this gap for me? \n\nCurrntly, I will grab the media at the available quality and then use unmanic to re-encode/transcode the file to fit my preferences, but it would be great if I could reduce the frequency of that whole process.",

          "text": "Hi there. Very similar to my setup so I have a question because I don't often see Fritzbox routers here:\n\nFritzbox routers (at least my model 7690) has  this NAT problem where you cannot see the network if you are on the network and in the VPN. Its called NAT loopback or NAT hairpin. \n\nThis is the scenario: I am in the city, so I connect to Wireguard because I want to access an internal page, I get home later and the VPN client is still up on my mobile, when I am on the local network, the VPN client ends up blocking all traffic to and from my mobile because it does not know how to handle the NAT when you are with a local address, accessing the public address.\n\nI tried to explain this to Fritzbox support and they didn't know what NAT was, so I gave up with them. Its crazy how somebody can just pretend they have no idea what you are talking about so they can close the ticket as \"delusional customer\" or something like this.\n\nDo you have this problem and are you able to work around it?\n\nMy homelab: In my network, as above but I have a old I5-46xxK processor in an old PC, instead of a Pi. This particular i5 processor support QSV, so I chose it because it can transcode quite well and uses low amount of power when idle. I love the Pi5, have had many Pis in my life, but this PC, although old (DDR3) is really low powered, 32GB RAM and runs Windows Server because I find the block deduplication easy to setup, reliable and efficient. I have a second old PC I use for running docker, Ollama, etc. for my application stack.\n\nEdited to add: I work in a datacenter for a living so from my experience, RAID, anywhere except on RAID specific hardware, in a datacenter, is a bad move. I prefer to have the disks all as stand-alone but I sync my precious folders to multiple devices. This gives me the advantage of lower power, redundant copies and I get to use all the rest of the disk space which would otherwise be used by the RAID.",

I have only used it for a couple of days, but so far it worked very well for me.\n\nThe app is Android only, but I believe the iOS app has this functionality built in.",

It'd be nice to be able to have some software connect to that API and then play songs that aren't in your library yet (and giving you the ability to like/dislike or not download the song to your library). \n\nListen to a lot of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, AIC, etc. and want to listen to other albums from that era that are similar, deep tracks, smaller labels, etc., you can have that happen. I'd love to have some options in a software to find like artists with those different things.\n\nSpotify raising prices (again), and I'm fully selfhosted now.

She does add music to her Spotify playlist, but I was going to set a script that grabs her Spotify playlist every week and downloads those songs onto the Jellyfin library.",

That maintenance burden killed the project within a year.\n\nIf goal is learning exercise that's valid, if it's for production use you might save months by extending existing player that already handles the hard parts like transcoding and client apps.
