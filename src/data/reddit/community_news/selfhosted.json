      "text": "Today, after raising security concerns in a post on r/huntarr regarding the lack of development standards in what looks like a 100% vibe-coded project, I was banned. This made my spidey senses tingle, so I decided to do a security review of the codebase. What I found was... not good. TLDR: If you have Huntarr exposed on your stack, anyone can pull your API keys for Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, and every other connected app without logging in, gaining full control over your media stack.\n\n# The process\n\nI did a security review of Huntarr.io (v9.4.2) and found critical auth bypass vulnerabilities. I'm posting this here because Huntarr sits on top of (and is now trying to replace them as well!) Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, and other *arr apps that have years of security hardening behind them. If you install Huntarr, you're adding an app with zero authentication on its most sensitive endpoints, and that punches a hole through whatever network security you've set up for the rest of your stack.\n\n**The worst one:** `POST /api/settings/general` requires no login, no session, no API key. Nothing. Anyone who can reach your Huntarr instance can rewrite your entire configuration and the response comes back with **every setting for every integrated application** in cleartext. Not just Huntarr's own proxy credentials - the response includes API keys and instance URLs for Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Lidarr, Readarr, Whisparr, and every other connected app. One curl command and an attacker has direct API access to your entire media stack:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST http://your-huntarr:9705/api/settings/general \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"proxy_enabled\": true}'\n```\n\nFull config dump with passwords and API keys for every connected application. If your instance is internet-facing - and it often is, Huntarr incorporates features like Requestarr designed for external access - anyone on the internet can pull your credentials without logging in.\n\n**Other findings (21 total across critical/high/medium):**\n\n- **Unauthenticated 2FA enrollment on the owner account** (Critical, **proven in CI**): `POST /api/user/2fa/setup` with no session returned the actual TOTP secret and QR code for the owner account. An attacker generates a code, calls `/api/user/2fa/verify`, enrolls their own authenticator. Full account takeover, no password needed.\n- **Unauthenticated setup clear enables full account takeover** (Critical, **proven in CI**): `POST /api/setup/clear` requires no auth. Returns 200 \"Setup progress cleared.\" An attacker re-arms the setup flow, creates a new owner account, replaces the legitimate owner entirely.\n- **Unauthenticated recovery key generation** (Critical, **proven in CI**): `POST /auth/recovery-key/generate` with `{\"setup_mode\": true}` reaches business logic with no auth check (returns 400, not 401/403). The endpoint is unauthenticated.\n- **Full cross-app credential exposure** (Critical, **proven in CI**): Writing a single setting returns configuration for 10+ integrated apps. One call, your entire stack's API keys.\n- **Unauthenticated Plex account unlink** - anyone can disconnect your Plex from Huntarr\n- **Auth bypass on Plex account linking** via client-controlled `setup_mode` flag - the server skips session checks if you send `{\"setup_mode\": true}`\n- **Zip Slip arbitrary file write** (High): `zipfile.extractall()` on user-uploaded ZIPs without filename sanitization. The container runs as root.\n- **Path traversal in backup restore/delete** (High): `backup_id` from user input goes straight into filesystem paths. `shutil.rmtree()` makes it a directory deletion primitive.\n- `local_access_bypass` trusts `X-Forwarded-For` headers, which are trivially spoofable - combine with the unauth settings write and you get full access to protected endpoints\n\n**How I found this:** Basic code review and standard automated tools (bandit, pip-audit). The kind of stuff any maintainer should be running. The auth bypass isn't a subtle bug - `auth.py` has an explicit whitelist that skips auth for `/api/settings/general`. It's just not there.\n\n**About the maintainer and the codebase:**\n\nThe maintainer [says](https://i.imgur.com/sjPAT1u.png) they have \"a series of steering documents I generated that does cybersecurity checks and provides additional hardening\" and **\"Note I also work in cybersecurity.\"** They [say](https://i.imgur.com/8AkHZ27.png) they've put in \"120+ hours in the last 4 weeks\" using \"steering documents to advise along the way from cybersecurity, to hardening, and standards\". If that's true, it's not showing in the code.\n\nIf you work in cybersecurity, you should know not to whitelist your most sensitive endpoint as unauthenticated. You should know that returning TOTP secrets to unauthenticated callers is account takeover. You should know `zipfile.extractall()` on untrusted input is textbook Zip Slip. This is introductory stuff. The \"cybersecurity steering documents\" aren't catching what a basic security scan flags in seconds.\n\nLook at the [commit history](https://i.imgur.com/TomsJz0.png): dozens of commits with messages like \"Update\", \"update\", \"Patch\", \"change\", \"Bug Patch\" - hundreds of changed files in commits separated by a few minutes. No PR process, no code review, no second pair of eyes - just raw trunk-based development where 50 features get pushed in a day with zero review. Normal OSS projects are slower for a reason: multiple people look at changes before they go in. Huntarr has none of that.\n\nWhen [called out on this](https://i.imgur.com/dF0Oyst.png), the maintainer said budget constraints: \"With a limited budget, you can only go so far unless you want to spend $1000+. I allot $40 a month in the heaviest of tasks.\" That's just not true - you can use AI-assisted development 8 hours a day for $20/month. The real problem isn't the budget. It's that the maintainer doesn't understand the security architecture they're building and doesn't understand the tools they're using to build it. You can't guide an AI to implement auth if you don't recognize what's wrong when it doesn't.\n\n**They also censor security reports and ban people who raise concerns.** A user posted security concerns on r/huntarr and it was [removed by the moderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/huntarr/comments/1rbtri7/removed_by_moderator/) - the maintainer controls the subreddit. I was banned from r/huntarr after pointing out these issues in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/huntarr/comments/1rccfcd/huntarr_94_released_user_requests_bundling/) where the maintainer was claiming to work in cybersecurity (which they now deleted).\n\nOne more thing - the project's README has a \"Support - Building My Daughter's Future\" section soliciting donations. That's a red flag for me. You're asking people to fund your development while shipping code with 21 unpatched security vulnerabilities, no code review process, and banning people who point out the problems, while doing an appeal to emotion about your daughter. If you need money, that's fine - but you should be transparent about what you're spending it on and you should be shipping code that doesn't put your users at risk.\n\n**Proof repo with automated CI:** https://github.com/rfsbraz/huntarr-security-review\n\nDocker Compose setup that pulls the published Huntarr image and runs a Python script proving each vulnerability. GitHub Actions runs it on every push - check the workflow results yourself or run it locally with `docker compose up -d && python3 scripts/prove_vulns.py`.\n\nFor what it's worth, and to prove I'm not an AI hater, the `prove_vulns` script itself was vibe coded - I identified the vulnerabilities through code review, wrote up the repro steps, and had AI generate the proof script.\n\nFull security review (21 findings): https://github.com/rfsbraz/huntarr-security-review/blob/main/Huntarr.io_SECURITY_REVIEW.md\n\n**What happens next:** The maintainer will most likely prompt these problems away - feed the findings to an AI and ship a patch. But fixing 21 specific findings doesn't fix the process that created them. No code review, no PR process, no automated testing, no one who understands security reviewing what ships. The next batch of features will have the next batch of vulnerabilities. This is only the start. If the community doesn't push for better coding standards, controlled development, and a sensible roadmap, people will keep running code that nobody has reviewed.\n\nIf you're running Huntarr, keep it off any network you don't fully trust until this is sorted. The *arr apps it wraps have their own API key auth - Huntarr bypasses that entirely.\n\nPlease let others know about this. If you have a Huntarr instance, share this with your community. If you know someone who runs one, share it with them. The more people know about the risks, the more pressure there will be on the maintainer to fix them and improve their development process.\n\nEdit: Looks like r/huntarr went private and the repo got deleted or privated https://github.com/plexguide/Huntarr.io . I'm sorry for everyone that donated to this guy's \"Daughter College Fund\".\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the love on the comments, I'll do my best to reach out to everyone I can. People asking me for help on security reviews, believe me when I say I did little more than the basics - the project was _terrible_.",

It was the new hot thing for a minute and I get it, it was the lack of process, resistance to feedback, and general attitude that led to me to do this deep dive. Not diving into the code and just browsing Cleanuparr tells me this is not the same thing, readable commits, trackable PRs, sustainable rate of development.",

I have had Huntarr installed on my stack for a while, the original (just the Huntarr portion) was exposed to the web for a while, but in the past 2 weeks I've completely rewritten my compose stacks and made it internal only. \n\nA few days ago I noticed the massive integrations (the replacement for sonarr, radarr, nzbget, etc...) and thought \"this is pretty sweet.\" and tested it out, and it worked well. I decided to keep my current setup and disable those for the time being though. I saw HuntarrOS yesterday and was going to set it up for a friend, who isn't tech/docker savvy and figured the \"new\" Huntarr would be perfect for him, instead of teaching him about multiple apps. \n\nI got caught up with other stuff yesterday and didn't get around to it. I went to install it today and was confused when I saw that the Github repos were giving 404s when I just accessed them yesterday. When I googled for Huntarr I found this post, luckily. \n\nYou saved our asses here!",

Ports from applications aren't exposed to the host but are available to Nginx so all traffic to an application must go through Nginx.\n\n0 - Only exposed to my own VLAN\n1 - Exposed to myself and my family\n2 - Exposed to all network users\n3 - Exposed publicly\n\nJellyfin will be in level 3 but Huntarr is in level 1. Because no one on my network except for me can access the services these vulnerabilities are of a lower concern. Someone would either have to make Nginx ignore my trusted access list or find a way to get an IP in my VLAN before they could exploit one of these vulnerabilities.\n\nThis is a super simple measure to add to any application to immediately reduce your risk.",

The entire architecture, design decisions, and core foundations were all built without any AI involvement. I only recently began using AI to speed up feature releases and streamline workflows.\n\nI don't blindly accept AI-generated code either. Every line gets reviewed before it's committed. I've got 12+ years of software engineering experience across a wide range of domains, so I'm pretty particular about what makes it into the codebase.\n\nAnd look, AI isn't going anywhere. I genuinely believe it's the future of software development, but only when it's in the hands of experienced engineers who actually understand what they're building.\n\nIf you want to do a security audit, go for it! I'm confident in the app. I believe someone already did a pen test and it came back clean. Always happy to have more eyes on it though!\n\nEdit: Also just curious, what gave you the impression that Booklore is vibe coded?",

I think I started Cleanuparr just a bit before Huntarr was a thing, or just before it was a vibe coded thing, I'm not sure. The dev was releasing feature after feature, something I couldn't compete with (I was using no AI at the time; now I do), and he joined here to ask if it's cool to basically take my app and port it into his, making the shift from C# to Python. I preferred he didn't, as this is a passion project for me and I didn't want it to be hijacked. So we talked, we agreed it wasn't going to happen, but it could be beneficial for users to promote each other. Cleanuparr was almost always more feature rich and customizable than Swapparr (which Huntarr had), and Huntarr was filling the media gaps for triggering searches organically, at the user's discretion, to replace what has been lost or never found. It was basically like I said in the readme: a very good combination. Seemed like a good opportunity to me and we probably did steer some users to the other one's repo by doing so\"",

I raised a question on Discord and was told that wasn't what Huntarr was meant to do (even though it was literally in the description). So, based off what it was originally meant to do, it only did 2/3rds of that yet spent more time building and connecting new additions and features trying to overtake then entire media server stack as an all in one utility.  If someone wants to build out an all in one, that's fine and dandy,  but IMO if you're going to claim your project does one thing, make sure it does that one thing before adding the bells and whistles. Huntarr's downfall is because the dev wanted to put too much in to it too quickly and left a bunch of doors open in the process. In the short amount of time I knew about it jumped from just being announced to version 9.x.x. Thats a red flag for me. Too fast too quickly. Software typically takes years between versions and here he's versioning up almost twice a month.",

This is a great case study in use of Agentic AI for software development, was he entirely in the wrong, I think not, could he have maybe learned from his mistakes if his ego didn't get the best of him probably.\n\nNow to call out what his tool did well in, his original intentions of solving the gap of the Arr tools relying on RSS feeds and not having support to regularly check for potential upgrades to media.  This brings to light a simple but technically challenging feature set that I my self had on my backlog for my personal tool to replace the Arr stack.  Perhaps this is a feature Seerr or another Arr tool will take notice of and consider solving with the existing foundations in place.\n\nNow I feel even more motivated to continue the work on my side project to get it up to par with existing Arr tools...",

I hold nothing against their business personally and I am always more than happy to comply with reasonable demands (like removing trademarked name parts from project), but I don't think the exporter is against the rules (I have my own logic for fair business practice) and now the CEO wants to meet for a quick call (I hope friendly), to discuss and reason things out. I need to present my points fairly as well and don't want to get pressured/voiced down, just because I am alone with my logic. I am sure as a company with > 1 million $ revenue they have a larger backing.**\n\n⚠️⚠️ I am already in chat with u/Archiver_test4 as a legal representative, but we are in a different time zone. If anyone else in addition would like to take a look to help me, present their view, or get involved, I am more than happy to talk and get some feedback on how can I present my idea (reach out only If you are a lawyer, but please note I am not in a position to pay any fees). It's best if you have knowledge of EU legal rules and data protection policy, GDPR etc. Please reach out to me as this is the right time to make the reasoning and requests. feel free to email me to [contact@opendronelog.com](mailto:contact@opendronelog.com) or send me a chat here. I might not reply until morning, as it's quite late here now.\n\nNone of these would have happened only if they sent me this same email before sending the letter.\n\n[The Unfair competition clause I mentioned.](https://preview.redd.it/pg9lktdte4lg1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5c70d0bc7f404477fab42be7e8aab2cbb32725)\n\n[Some demands](https://preview.redd.it/jo3nz51s0alg1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7a65c260432e94cb1c6c08ea495cce0322f6c06)\n\n💜💜 Thanks to the r/drones and r/selfhosted and r/opensource community we were able to reach to this stage in record time. As in individual, you can voice your opinion. It proved again that what opensource communities can do and this thread is a living proof of that.\n\n\\--------\n\n**TL;DR:** I made an [open-source, local-first dashboard for drone flight logs](https://opendronelog.com) because the biggest corporate player in the space locks your older data behind a paywall. They found my GitHub, tracked my Reddit posts, and hit me with a legal notice for \"unfair competition\" and trademark infringement.\n\n**Long version:** I maintain a few small open-source projects. About two weeks ago, I released a free, self-hostable tool that lets drone pilots collect, map, and analyze their flight logs locally. I didn't think much of it, just a passion project with a few hundred users.\n\nI can’t name the company (let's call them \"Company A\") because their legal team is actively monitoring my Reddit account and cited my past posts in their notice. Company A is the giant in this space. Their business model goes like this:\n\n* You can upload unlimited flight logs for free.\n* BUT you can only view the last 100 flights.\n* If you want to see your older data, you have to pay a monthly subscription *and* a $15 \"retrieval fee.\"\n* Even then, you can't bulk download your own logs. You have to click them one by one. They effectively hold your own data hostage to lock you into their ecosystem. I am not sure if they are even GDPR complaint even in the EU\n\nTo help people transition to my open-source tool, I wrote a simple web-based script that allowed users to log into their own Company A accounts and automate the bulk download of their own files. Company A did not like this. They served me with a highly aggressive, 4-page legal demand (CEASE and DESIST notice). They forced me to:\n\n1. Nuke the automated download tool entirely from GitHub.\n2. Remove any mention of their company name from my main open-source project and website (since it’s trademarked). I originally had my tagline as \"The Free open-source \\[Company A\\] Alternative,\" which they claimed was illegally driving their traffic to my site.\n3. Remove a feature comparison chart I made. (I admittedly messed up here, I only compared my free tool to their paid tier and omitted their limited free tier, which they claimed was misleading and defamatory).\n\nI'm just a solo dev, so I complied with the core of their demands to stay out of trouble. I scrubbed their name, took down the downloader, and sanitized my website. My main open-source logbook lives independent of them.\n\nI admit I was naive about the legal aspects of comparison marketing and using trademarked names. But the irony is that they probably spent thousands of dollars on lawyer fees to draft a threat against my small project that makes close to zero money (I got a few small donations from happy users).\n\nHas anyone else here ever dealt with corporate lawyers coming after your self-hosted/FOSS projects? It’s a crazy initiation :)\n\n**EDIT : Lot of people think the company is DJI, it's NOT DJI. I love their drones and their customer service. It's not them.**",

However, the point of a cease and desist is to effect the company’s goal, regardless of the legal merit of their arguments or whether the lawyer would dare making such a claim in front of a judge.\n\nIt is definitely not in the public interest that this bluster has impeded your ability to compete with their unusual rent-seeking model that is based on throttling their customers’ access to their own personally generated data from flights they commanded. Because it is an open source product that you do for your own enjoyment rather than monetary gain, I don’t know if you can seek damages as a result of them impeding your ability to distribute your product, but their might be similar cases that have occurred with other open source products.",

We measure a company not by the vulnerability, but by their response to it. To us, it is very clear when a company cares more about their bottom line than about it's users.

If the situation were reversed, the company would not hesitate to smear you in the media.  Just look up the McDonalds hot coffee spill case.  They smeared an elderly woman in the media attempting to get off the hook for their intentional endangerment.  At that time, a corporate memo showed McDonalds policy dictating super-heating their coffee under pressure to above boiing temperature's so that customers would be unlikely to ask for a free refill.  Not surprisingly, handing paper cups of super-heated liquid to customers was not very safe.  And the result was 3rd degree burns to an 80 year old woman's labia.  Which had to be amputated and she almost died in the hospital.  But McDonalds spent millions on news propaganda making themselves the victim.  ",

I have some incredible news for the community: the matter is officially resolved in favor of the entire drone community.\n\n**TLDR:** **AirData UAV** has complied with community concerns, implemented a robust data takeout solution, and we have settled the matter gracefully.\n\n**The free OSS project in question :** [**www.opendronelog.com**](https://www.opendronelog.com)\n\n\\---------------\n\nSince the legal threat is no longer active, I can finally name the company. It was **AirData UAV**, a US based drone log analysis and reporting service. Eran said it's my choice to name them or not name them here in this update post, I choose to name, because I don't have anything bad to say anymore.\n\nDespite the first approach was a C&D, the final outcome was actually better than I hoped for (surprised actually!). A massive thank you goes to u/Archiver_test4, who acted as my legal representative pro bono (for free!! and denied donations). He prepared a powerful response and helped me pass this with confidence. He has even started a new subreddit, [r/Opensource\\_legalAid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Opensource_legalAid/), to help other indie devs in similar situations.\n\n# The Meeting with the Airdata UAV CEO Eran Steiner\n\nIn response to the traction the [original post](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1rbkx5e/large_us_community_came_after_me_for_releasing_a/) gained, AirData CEO **Eran Steiner** reached out for a face to face meeting via email within 6 hours of the post going live. He expressed regret over the legal route they initially took (he took the responsibility for that as well as CEO) and personally saw to it that the following changes were made before we even spoke:\n\n* **Official Data Takeout Solution:** This was the **main goal** (and my demand for data portability and fairness, because it's painful to export files one by one, clicking one after another and waiting). **AirData UAV** now provides a **central takeout solution**, making them fully GDPR compliant. You can now download your data in its original format without needing my 3rd party automation \"patch.\". If you are interested, [please check out here](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/open-dronelog#airdata-exports).\n* **Trademark Resolution:** We agreed that fair representation and disclaimers are the way to go. I have already added these to my project, and I am free to use their name when representing truthful facts, as permitted by EU laws. I won't go into more technical/legal aspects than this of what trademark rights they actually hold or not.\n* **Account Restoration:** As a gesture of goodwill, they have **fully restored my account** and all my log files before I asked. ❤️\n* We agreed to drop all allegations and, in the future, talk through any issues personally rather than involving lawyers.\n\nI am just a solo dev working in my free time, and I have no intention of competing with an established company. I am just thrilled that the community now has true data portability as I hoped for, and they are free to choose as they please based on what features/interface they like. Thank you Eran for making this happen so quick without any drama/delay or missed promise. AirData no longer \"holds your data\" to keep you on their platform. To be fair, they do have a functional and data rich toolset that many in the community still enjoy (including myself!) - They also have a very robust data sync solution which works very well. I am not paid or bribed or sponsored by them, I am just giving credit where it's due.\n\nThank you r/selfhosted for all for the support. It made all the difference! Open Source for the WIN!",

I'm sure we account for such a minute amount of market share that it really serves no other purpose than to piss people off, and rile up the masses if it makes it to a large enough audience. Good on the CEO for (I assume) coming to this same conclusion rather than trying to crush even the smallest pockets of market share.",

              "text": "My apartment complex doesn’t allow smart breakers, so I was forced to make an entity that calculated kWh usage, and bill cost based on the amount of time my heater/fan has been running. My electricity provider doesn’t have an API that lets me grab raw data so I used a script utilizing playwright that logins into the portal as me, downloads my most current usage .CSV, and exports the data to Home Assistant with a rest sensor. Cron runs it every 5 minutes, so the data is always fresh. It’s basically a hack to read their meter in real time. As long as you know your providers electricity cost, you should be able to calculate the same based on the specs of your HVAC unit. \n\nThe AC/Heating card is a very customized better thermostat ui card that relies on automations to run. The way I have it setup, is that the HVAC unit will never turn on unless the manual override is triggered. Think of it as a safety trigger. Without the override the HVAC unit will turn off every time, whether it's set to run manually, in Home Assistant, or in the Meross app. I press the custom button to turn on the override, select my temperature, and let the automations do the rest. I also have it integrated into my Stream Deck.\n\nWhen the set temperature has been reached for > 5 minutes, the manual override will turn off and that keeps the unit from running up my bill. I have automations that turn on the manual override and set the temp and mode based on what I need. For example, when I come home after being gone for > 30 minutes, the AC will automatically kick on to 68.\n\nThe Sankey card is very custom and relies on a ton of custom entities that are associated with the .CSV data that my rest sensor collects. If you want to know more about that, it would be easier for me to jut drop a pastebin. \n\nHope this helps, let me know if you need to know anything in specific!\n\nEdit: https://pastebin.com/vYLxvevR This is the thermostat card I use.",

It has no labels.\n - Sleep tracking: what does that graph even mean? Did OP not sleep in days? Weeks? Did they have light _and_ deep _and_ REM sleep at the same time?\n - Upcoming events: well, funnily enough that one looks visually bad but is actually legible...\n - System temps: at least this one has _some_ labels. Making it truly beautiful could involve sharing the colours from the graph with the current values above rather than the current gray.\n - The sankey diagram about power usage is combining billing and power usage, and crosses two lines for absolutely no reason?\n - The online/latency/... table lacks a bit of contrast on the online cells, but I guess there are bigger problems...\n - Similarly the Plex stats have colours that are not accounting for the background at all. That movie count particularly...\n - Oh, we're back to the thermostat! Why is this not underneath the weather?\n\nYeah, at a glance, it looks pretty. But the data presented here is nothing close to beautiful. It's form over function, by a lot. I genuinely like the style, it's its own thing, and some of the visualisations _could_ be very nice. But the missing 10% of work is sorely visible here.",

I was pretty impressed with the speed at which I could make it based on about 15-20 minutes of outline using the Plan mode in Cursor and then several iterations of testing and re-prompting.\n\nWell then I actually looked at the code and was pretty horrified. For example, It had generated two sets of sidebar code, one for the overall view, and one for when I was clicked on an image for display.\n\nI did ask a friend who uses these tools more regularly and he pointed out I needed to direct the AI to reuse code and create templates as often as possible, but I can absolutely see how someone just sleepwalking their way through generating an application could run into these sorts of issues. \n\nIt also is one of those cases where its the most dangerous when you don't know what to add to your outline/prompts to keep it controlled. But if you already know enough to ask that, then wouldn't you already be capable of writing it yourself? I suppose there's some arguments to be made about increasing your speed and then checking back later, but if junior/non-devs are going to use these tools in lieu of learning then they'll never know they'd need to watch out for these issues in the first place! Its a real chicken/egg problem.\n\nI think the best approach is one I've seen other engineers point out, which is to learn it the actual way and only when you're comfortable with writing these things yourself should you really dip into any sort of automated code generation, and even then keep it on a short leash. Its something I'm still struggling with applying, though I've gotten some pretty decent unit testing code out of it, even if I do have to read over each test and make sure they're *actually performing a test that can fail*.",

What AI does is increase code output in return for greatly increased technical debt. Unfortunately *reducing* that technical debt isn't faster than before.\n\n\nThis *feels* much faster at first, but as the technical debt becomes worse and worse the generated code becomes less and less reliable because the terrible code is so badly encapsulated that the AI cannot keep all the necessary parts in its limited context.  \n\n\nAs a result the number of bugs increases and you'll have angry users/customers yelling at you to fix it. At this point you have two options: fix the technical debt or abandon the project.\n\n\nBecause solo AI developers didn't actually have to put much work into building the project they usually end up choosing the latter, which is why so many vibecoded projects end up abandoned after 6-18 months.\n\n\nIf you choose the former you'll slow down *a lot* and in the end need to spend more time fixing the mess left by AI than it would have taken to just do it without AI in the first place.\n\n\nThe only people who are genuinely permanently more productive with it are those in big corporations offloading the technical debt on someone else. The company as a whole still suffers from it, though. Looking at you, Microslop.",

But literally after an hour or so of it being up I decided it wasn’t worth it to have it publicly available. If someone wants it I can give them the code and they can do what they want with it. It’s safe enough living on my network but I don’t trust it public facing and it’s not fair to anyone else to even hint that it might be. I don’t understand the code, I only know it does what it supposed to and know that it’s probably one giant security vulnerability. But that’s not what this guy did. \n\nEspecially after misrepresenting themselves as a “security expert”, the whole thing feels scummy. Almost intentionally so. \n\nSo yeah, it’d be nice to have a sub to show off and share vibe coded shit with the understanding that the author has no idea what it’s doing behind the scene, and keep this sub for legit projects. (Not that any of us should be running anything we don’t understand, but at the same time there is peer review and the community does a good job of self policing to someone protect the people here are aren’t as tech savvy) \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",

That looks like a endpoint to exfiltrate data to me. I'm looking at it through the glasses of \"suspected malicious intent\". I just find it suspicious that they pulled the source code after the vulnerability became public instead of addressing the issue, as if they would be hiding something. Even if the app is not explicitly sending telemetry to expose the keys (which would be way more obvious to spot), it wouldn't be the first time that conscious mistakes were added into source code (There was one added to the Linux Kernel not long time ago, I don't have the name of it at hand right now) that came in form of deliberate buffer overflows (Way more sophisticated than this one). In any case, they might have been teenagers who just freaked out after the vibe coding backlash, but I'd still be curious of this strange behavior.",

I thought of getting a Public IP (costs money + hassle), or employing a VPN (friends outside the network can't use it) or using cloudflare (privacy risk)\n\nThen i stumbled upon using only an IPv6 address. it was a win for sure!\n\n* No port forwarding\n* Avoids bot scans\n* More static than ipv4, no need for ddns (can use dynv6 if needed)\n\nWhy do we keep using IPv4?\n\nHas anyone tried using only IPv6 and come across any limitations?",

I was on the LB and DNS team, and worked with the backbone/transit network team. Overall I'd say the amount of effort was minor (which is good or else management probably wouldn't have let us do it).\n\nGranted that left 40,000+ hosts on ipv4, but with literally only one or two exceptions, none accepted internet traffic. Probably 1/3 had public IPs the rest were either fully private or behind NAT.\n\nAt the time we were rolling out our own cloud, and it had v6 as an experimental option.\n\nThe reality though- all of this was driven by tech geeks, and only allowed to proceed because it didn't cost much. The business certainly didn't give a shit. When amventure capital firm took over, anything that didn't have a _direct_ tie to increasing revenue/reducing costs was killed.\n\nTwo big tech problems that we were facing were: ACLs and geo-location. I honestly can't remember where we left those two things, but they have the same fundamental issue: mapping the IPv6 IP space is _hard_, instead of 4billion routable ips there are 2 quintillion of them. I haven't kept up in that space, but I imagine either: there are new strategies, network appliances have scaled to the point where they can deal with it, or (and most likely) they're still a problem because nobody cares.",

There's an easy test for this: can you use 1.0.0.0/8, 2.0.0.0/8 etc on the network, or would that cause problems? If it would cause problems then congrats, you've discovered why we have v6.\n\nEven when you have a network that would actually be fine with that -- what happens when your company gets bought out and needs to merge networks with somebody else who also figured that keeping everything in 1/8 was fine?\n\nAlso it's easier to keep things logically laid out in v6, because you have more space available and you can mostly do your subnetting on character boundaries. For example, you could use `2001:db8:xxyy:zzzz::` where x, y and z are region/building/VLAN respectively, e.g. `2001:db8:102:3::/64` is VLAN 3 in building 2 in region 1, or however you want to do it. You don't need to mess around with memorizing subnetting tables or doing conversions, or trying to work out if it's .160-191. or .172-191., or spend any time thinking about whether you'll ever need to grow beyond 256 hosts in any given network and if so whether 512 will be enough or if you'll need more. You'll always have enough IPs on every network, and you'll have enough space that if you need to grow to multiple networks you'll generally have room to do it in place rather than needing to fragment or renumber.\n\nOn v4 you'll usually end up with a mess of NAT on any non-trivial network. When you've got a host whose address is 192.168.2.42, but it shows up as 203.0.113.8 to internet hosts, but you had an RFC1918 clash on a few of your acquisitions so some parts of your company access it via 192.168.202.42 and other parts need 172.16.1.42 and your VPN sometimes can't reach it because some home users use 192.168.2.0/24... how is that easier to comprehend than \"the IP is 2001:db8:113:2::42\"?",

NAT and port forwarding might seem a bit clunky but it's also intuitive in a way, in that if I want to send a packet in to a machine inside my network then I just send it to my router's public IP with an appropriate port forward rule, and the router relays it to my machine's v4 address that it uses for pretty much everything, while with IPv6 that same machine will have 2-3 addresses at any one time and you're supposed to use different ones in different contexts, and some of them may or may not work, and the public facing one might keep changing or stay the same, and even though it's public facing it still might get firewalled by the router except it isn't as clear that the router is going to be doing anything other than just relaying the packets because they aren't meant to be for the router. \n\n\nI'm sure it's simple enough to get your head around with the effort but the point is that it's still *some* effort and it's effort that doesn't need to be spent *at all* if you just stick with NAT, at least short term.

A reboot fixes it every time. I think it happens since I removed dhcpcd and let the kernel handle RAs, which was necessary because dhcpcd doesn't understand RIOs that are needed for Matter.\n\nIPv6 also has no proper way to assign fixed addresses to clients or to report addresses back to DNS. There are a couple of RFCs but to my knowledge there is currently nothing that would work with Windows, Linux and Android clients.\n\nThere is also nothing in terms of load balancing between internet lines. It's as if the IPv6 people didn't even think about how to solve this. Well, there is NPT with ULAs, but if a hostname resolves to an IPv4 address and a ULA, other hosts will prefer the IPv4 address.",

          "text": "\\> Why do we keep using IPv4?\n\nThis is a great question. The answer is because it costs too much for most organizations (universities, businesses, governments, service providers) to even \\*support\\* IPv6, let alone \\*switch\\* to it. I'll give a practical example.\n\nMy university network is IPv4 only. I asked the IT department what their reasoning was for choosing that route instead of going dual-stack, which would provide a happy medium between feature richness, compatibility with other services, and stability. Their answer was essentially that revising their threat model and security policies and deploying/supporting network gear that supports IPv6 is too costly to justify the benefits. From their perspective, there is no \\*need\\* to support IPv6, so investing time and money into doing so would be wasteful.\n\nThe problem is that if you, a provider of services like Jellyfin or Vaultwarden, want your users (of which you yourself are one) to be able to access your services from anywhere, you are forced by these types of network administrators to provide support for IPv4, which in turn perpetuates their lack of motivation to support IPv6. We have ourselves a catch 22.\n\nI experienced this whole fiasco myself when trying to deploy a similar stack of services exclusively over IPv6, and was met with compatibility hell from all fronts. Many residential networks have it disabled by default, many orgs don't support it at all, and nobody wants to dig around in their router settings or call their ISP to bug them about the lack of support when there is already a working, simple, mature solution: just using IPv4.\n\nIPv6 optimists will tell you it is only a matter of time before the whole world supports IPv6. I am here to tell you that this will not happen. Too much of our infrastructure and network modeling revolves around NAT and IPv4. The dual-stack reality has metastasized, and will likely not go away in our lifetimes.",

It’s the same internet either way and end users simply don’t care, your ISP handles the plumbing and it’s all magic to the user.

In theory your ISP could give you a static ipv6 because there is no shortage of them that's true, but mine does not. In fact my ipv4 is almost static but my ipv6 changes every single day. This is a big problem. Creating Firewall rules for example is complex because you now have devices changing the ip address and you can not control this. Secondly ddns of course now has to run on every device you want to reach, but every device maybe supports different ddns providers. There is a way around that with dynv6, but even that is not plug and play. For every new device manual interaction with the ddns provider is needed.\n\nThe final roadblock however is surprisingly docker. I use dockers MACVLAN network and that is just unable to work with dynamic ipv6 addresses. So I stay with ipv4.",

My self-hosted services are primarily running IPv6, with Jellyfin being a notable exception because the Roku TV in our living room refuses to do IPv6 despite enabling in the stupid secret menu.\n\nAs for how complicated it is, I honestly think the overall protocol suite design is _less_ complicated than the current iteration of IPv4 deployment. CIDR is the same but for more bits and once I wrapped my head around Neighbor Discovery and SLAAC it all gelled for me.\n\nYes there have been a few attempts at various important things but afaict nothing core has changed for at least a decade. I enjoy the fact that it was all designed to work together rather than haphazardly assembled like with IPv4. \n",

          "text": "Because existing ISPs need to deploy infrastructure to support IPv6, new ISPs need to have staff that understand IPv6 in order to deploy it first (rather than deploying IPv4), and most companies have been too lazy and/or short-sighted to do those things. Thus, the question isn't one for users, but for ISPs. The user (e.g. you) has to ask their ISP, \"do you support IPv6?\" If the ISP doesn't support it, the user cannot do anything about it except:\n\n- find a different ISP that does support it; or\n- join an IPv6 network using an IPv4 tunnel (e.g. [Hurricane Electric IPv6 Tunnel Broker](https://tunnelbroker.net/)), but this can be prohibitively slow and/or blocked by various sites/services you might want to visit/use.\n\nAn ISP that does support IPv6 can support IPv4 quite easily by just offering a translation service. The ISP only needs to do any actual IPv4 routing at their network boundary; all internal (non-boundary) infrastructure can exclusively speak IPv6. Translation techniques such as 464XLAT eliminate as much IPv4 as possible whilst still allowing IPv6-only clients to communicate with IPv4 peers.\n\n***\n\nIPv6 prevalence has increased from 10% to 50% globally over the last 10 years, so the future looks good. However, the present is still very much a coin-flip, so for now, if you want your services to be accessible by a random subset of the general public, you'll need to make your services accessible via an IPv4 address too.\n\nIn the case of single NAT, most people are familiar with how to do this: port forwarding.\n\nIn the case of CGNAT, the ISP is responsible for the port forwarding controls, and if multiple customers are behind the same public IP address and want the same port number forwarded to them, this is not possible, so ISPs that use CGNAT do not offer port forwarding. Instead, you can ask your ISP whether they can provide you with a publicly reachable IPv4 address for a fee, or you can rent a server to act as a general-purpose relay by running IP translation software like [Jool](https://nicmx.github.io/Jool) on it (allowing it to receive packets addressed to one of its own IPv4 addresses and forward these to an IPv6 address you specify; and vice-versa).",

Unfortunately IPv4 has taught a generation to block ports as a means of security where as IPv6 is generally a configuration error instead of a security situation. \n\nThen getting into how addresses are assigned, how NAT isn't the same concept, how most places don't support pure IPv6 without using IPv4 fallback, it just gets chaotic.",

Unfortunately that was never enforced.\n\nAnd good luck getting more than a /64, or even a /64, for a mobile backup Internet.

As the Internet blew up, there was a need to expand the number of devices that could connect, but IPv4 only had a limited number of addresses. So there were two solutions:\n\n1. NAT, which actually originated from a bespoke workaround solution\n\n2. Develop a new IP with a much larger address space\n\nThe biggest problem with IPv6 is that it's not strictly backwards compatible, so the device has to be able to support IPv6 to be able to use it. That shouldn't be so hard, right? Wrong, kiddo. We are still dealing with it today where some websites (like fucking Github, holy crap M$ needs to get their shit together) still don't support IPv6. Because many cloud services don't use IPv6, many ISPs (like fucking Virgin Media, get your shit together) also don't rollout IPv6, leading to a chicken and egg situation. \n\nTo all the people saying IPv6 is \"hard to read\", as a network engineer, you either have no idea what you're talking about, or you're not as good of a network engineer as you think you are.\n\nIPv6 is awesome and everyone should use it if possible.",

A lot of programs still use IP literals for access control, or assume they don’t change. For external access (ex. DNS), this also means each server needs to individually setup a cron job. Internal addressing is solvable via ULAs, but that does require an advanced setup.\n- Managing clients that can behave like routers. By this I mean setups such as a server running VMs or phone WiFi tethering. Neither IPv4 not IPv6 were designed for this, but NAT is a good solution which v6 discourages. The preferred v6 method is DHCPv6-PD, which isn’t commonly deployed outside of ISP<->router (and may not be possible in the home, especially with prefix rotation).\n- You can’t rely on v6 connectivity. My work for example does not provide it, so I make my services available over v4 anyways. Using SIIT-DC can avoid the need for IPv4 inside your network but you lose some of those benefits you listed.\n- Getting NTP to clients. There isn’t a Router Advertisement option for this, and support for DHCPv6 Information Request is not great. I had to use DHCPv4 to bootstrap a Talos machine as an example.",

Tracking fitness and having it sync automagically to sparky is great..\n\nBut you need to overhaul inputting food.  You need to make this easier.\n\nI’d also like to see you come up with a creative way to not to rely on OpenFoodFacts, their food database is super limited..  Nutritionx is a paid for solution and  Fatsecret it not dependable \n\nBut again..  you’re making good progress.  Please keep it going.",

Say 30g and set as serving.  \n\nAlso 100g unit is from OpenFoodFacts, so the app shows their default unit. \n\n  \nYou can import from Mealie or Tandoor if you already setup your food & nutrient database.

Some basic things are not working really well tbh and to be frank I believe this is grounded in using AI too a certain extend. \n\nFor example: If I want to add a new food and search for it \"online\" the results are super bad. I cannot even find a simple tomato or a banana. All I get is a list of irrelevant things. \n\nAnother example: I want to add something as \"quick food\" because it's a one time meal and if I import the meal by using CSV setting the flag it's not added to my daily food, I cannot search it in the meals to add it manually afterwards, but it's still there because if I want to reimport the CSV it says there is already food with that title.\n\nSo what I want to say: Yes, the idea of a selfhosted MyFitnessPal is super cool and I love it. But this app really needs some cleanup regarding the basic functionality before adding another 10 integrations of external services as new features.",

But the smarter crawlers rotate IPs and user agents constantly, so IP-based blocking only catches the lazy ones.\n\n  \nPoison fountains work on a completely different layer. The bot successfully crawls your site, thinks it got useful data, and feeds garbage into its training pipeline. By the time anyone notices, the damage is baked into the model weights.\n\n  \nI run both on my setup. CrowdSec with the community blocklist handles maybe 80% of the noise. The remaining 20% that gets through hits a tarpit with poisoned content served from a hidden path. The Anthropic research someone linked above is exactly why - even small amounts of bad data can wreck a dataset disproportionately.\n\n  \nOne thing worth adding: if you're using nginx, you can also check the robots.txt compliance first and only serve poison to bots that ignore it. That way legitimate crawlers (search engines etc) aren't affected.",

If the company's primary revenue model requires you to NOT self-host, the self-hosted option is always going to be on borrowed time.",

While we’re not open source, we offer a generous free self-hosted plan that many teams in this community can benefit from. Recently we’ve also been investing heavily in AI-driven app building. We believe this approach makes iteration faster and gives more flexibility than drag-and-drop based builders, especially since you can still access and customize the underlying code when needed.\n\nIf anyone is considering migrating from Retool or exploring alternatives, happy to help and answer any questions.\n\nOh, and we're also NOT VC-backed.

We are not automatically forcing ID verification for existing users nor are we requiring all new customers to ID verify.\n\nWe have had ID verification in place for some new accounts and for some other limited circumstances for years. \n\nIf you already have an account without verification then you had an experience like the majority of our customers. \n\nIf you are creating a new account and are asked to ID verify then please understand this is not a blanket requirement and we try to make it as limited as possible with the goal of preventing fraud and abuse. Our pricing attracts savvy builders as well as spammers, and we want to keep the spammers out so we can focus on building the world's best registrar.  \n\nSo, to the point of whether you would be asked to ID verify now that you have an account: No, save for very specific and limited edge cases below. There is no business reason to do this en masse.\n\nYou may voluntarily ID verify with us to get access to certain features, like ACH payment, or to regain control of a lost account, or an account owned by a deceased customer, etc. I would consider all of those actions initiated by the customer.\n\nAs far as actions that initiate as a result of our operations, if there is reasonable suspicion that your account is being used for DNS abuse, we may require ID verification. So while I can't say it will never happen to existing accounts, it is very, very rare within the scope of our 500,000 active customers and quite frankly is targeted at illegal or harmful activity.

Without it, the alternative would often be outright denial or permanent restriction.\n\nWe've used Veriff for selective verification for years. We are frequently revisiting the fraud-centric triggers for ID verification in order to block as many bad actors and let as many good customers in.

You've run out of ideas, what's left is maintenance, and that sucks, so you abandon the project shortly thereafter. \n\n2. You have plenty of \"ideas\" which leads to a vibe coded bloatware of a project that lost site of what it was supposed to be. You constantly chase the validation and dopamine hits of reddit posts for \"new features\" meanwhile the codebase erodes steadily because maintenance, planning, and architecture doesn't get upvotes or tickle your lizard brain.\n\nUltimately something happens, you run out of ideas, the app becomes too much of a parody of itself and it falls out of favor, or some massive hole is found, and you have a huntarr. Either isn't sustainable, one takes slightly longer to implode than the other. \n\nNo one says you can leverage an LLM in development, and a project can't survive with LLM helping.

There's just a lot out there and until you gain a level of expertise it's hard to evaluate.\n\nAnother feature that'd be fun to see is a \"beginner's first services\" list that included things that were easy to set up and maintain with good ROI on effort (things like Plex) that are great gateways into self-hosting.\n\nMaybe one day I'll just build this myself but maintaining it would be really hard, haha.",

Most projects are using AI in some form directly or indirectly so compiling lists of “AI-coded services” feels largely pointless. \n\nI don’t really get the witch-hunt against apps that were built fully or partially with AI. The tool isn’t the core issue  hygiene and common sense is. Non–mission-critical software is usually fine if it’s deployed responsibly, and it’s not that hard to apply basic hardening. AI can significantly speed up development, and that matters. Most FOSS developers have jobs next to their hobby. \n\nI’m not saying AI is the holy grail, and fully vibe-coded projects probably shouldn’t be exposed directly to the open internet without proper review. But if it gets the job done, its ran locally I really don't see the issue.\n\nEven in light of Huntarr, the scale of the issue feels exaggerated. If you didn’t expose the service publicly, you were likely fine.

In my opinion, they’re pretty basic for getting yt-dlp to work with services that are blocked in some countries, not to mention cookies.\n\nIt would also be nice to have instructions for running the app locally (not in docker). I assume it’s just about creating a virtual environment and installing requirements.txt, but where would I set things like THEME_COLOR or change the port?\n\nAnd sorry if this is a dumb question: if I run the .py file locally, do I need to manually update yt-dlp inside the virtual environment, or can the app handle that on its own?\n\nP.S. Personally, I see this more as a video downloader, with the option to just preview sometimes without downloading locally. And if it's also possible to download only audio, that would be just awesome. Either way thanks, I'm always all for new lightweight UIs for yt-dlp.",

What stuff would you download and which services would you self host?\n\nI have a few Raspberry Pi boards and a few terabytes of external HDDs, SSDs and USB flash drives. The goal would be to create an internet replacement that would work off grid. I'd connect them to a bunch of routers and APs to basically connect the whole neighborhood. Things would get powered by power banks, car batteries and solar panels (that's why I'm going with low power devices like Raspberry Pi).\n\nI've been self hosting for over 10 years and I've used a bunch of different services and know how to set up stuff. But I'd like to hear from other people to see if there's more stuff that'd be useful.\n\nSo first I'd need to configure the web server and local domains and somehow create my own local certificate authority so people can add that CA to trusted and automatically trust any new SSL cert I generate.  \n\nThen I'd need to create a local Debian repository with all common software so I can use apt to install software on other devices and servers.\n\nAnd of course other software for local search engine, wiki, DNS, chat, forums, social media, library, maps, maybe basic AI, etc.\n\nWhat else should I look for so I have stuff to learn from and fix programming rleated stuff (can I download entire forums like Stack Overflow, XDA, Arch, etc.)?\n\nSo, what exactly do I need and what would be good to have? Which service is best for each use case? What are the things I should pay attention to so I don't end up with stuff I can't fix without access to the internet?",

Then you need to take instruction in how to use the weapons that you are going to need to buy in order to protect yourself, physically, from those bad people.  Then you need to buy the weapons and start to equip the location that you have purchased to make it as impregnable and survivable as you can against the bad people.  You might want to include a good stock of printed books that explain how to survive without any electricity or electronics, at all. To be able to grow food and make fires to keep yourself warm.  You should  become very well acquainted with those books and that material, and try them out, before the \"apocalyptic scenario\" happens, so that you understand what you are capable of doing and whether/how you need to adjust your plan.\n\nOnce you have done this, you can start to stock up on stuff that you will need.  First of all, ammo, to defend yourself.  Second water to drink.  Third, food with very long storage lives until you become self-sufficient in growing stuff.  Fourth, tools to help you grow food and maintain your shelter and defensable position and water supply.  Fifth, clothing to protect you from the elements while you are growing food.  Sixth, simple iron pots and other cooking equipment - preferably completely unbreakable metal.\n\nNotice that I have not mentioned the internet yet.  I don't think you will need the internet for a VERY long time, given the scenario you specify.\n\nWhen you have re-invented the fundamental civil structure of the 21st century, THEN you can start to think about re-establishing the internet.\n\n  \nYou might also want to practice your survival skills for at least a year, through every season, without any contact from other people, to see how well you do, and what you might want to change.  If you do not practice, when the \"apocalypse\" happens, you will not be prepared, and you will not survive.",

I was checking what happened this morning and it wasn't even showing up in the file manager so I had to completely reboot the nas.\n\nThis then re-launched everything with SABNzbd trying to resume downloading everything that Seerr had requested so in the end I was forced to trash both containers, manually remove every request from Radarr and reload and reconfigure both of them just to get everything running properly again.\n\nSo won't be doing that again ..",

There are several limit controls available in the job scheduling settings (like max requests per run) specifically to prevent flooding Seerr with too many requests at once.\n\nYou can tune those limits so SuggestArr doesn’t generate that many requests in a single run and keeps everything under control.\n\nAlso, the SuggestArr + Seerr setup can absolutely be configured without auto-downloading content. You can disable automatic approval / download on the Seerr side with a new local user, so requests are just created and then manually reviewed instead of immediately triggering Radarr/Sonarr/SABnzbd.",
