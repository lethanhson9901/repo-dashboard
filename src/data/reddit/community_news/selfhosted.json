You might change some of that as needed to customise the setup.\n\nSo just imagine it as equivalent to setting up a VM with the app from a single file, except it's a container(a) instead (unless on Windows / macOS, then docker tends to run containers within a VM).",

Granted back then I imagine it was easier to find uncompressed and high quality photo to analyse... Anyway I'm always confused when I see this guy labelled as TPB founder with no solid confirmation when the entire context suggests he's Polish.\n\nYou missed one big obvious clue btw, you can include it for future use... Box branded with Mamut logo (known for their sucharki and other bread products) above Fizjologia book, below the partially disassembled speaker. It's their old logo. For reference: https://dodomku.pl/images/products/full/00045252.jpg\n\nEdit to add: I also remember that the chocolate package between two lower laptops was easily identified, although I can't remember the brand now...",

I hold nothing against their business personally and I am always more than happy to comply with reasonable demands (like removing trademarked name parts from project), but I don't think the exporter is against the rules (I have my own logic for fair business practice) and now the CEO wants to meet for a quick call (I hope friendly), to discuss and reason things out. I need to present my points fairly as well and don't want to get pressured/voiced down, just because I am alone with my logic. I am sure as a company with > 1 million $ revenue they have a larger backing.**\n\n⚠️⚠️ I am already in chat with u/Archiver_test4 as a legal representative, but we are in a different time zone. If anyone else in addition would like to take a look to help me, present their view, or get involved, I am more than happy to talk and get some feedback on how can I present my idea (reach out only If you are a lawyer, but please note I am not in a position to pay any fees). It's best if you have knowledge of EU legal rules and data protection policy, GDPR etc. Please reach out to me as this is the right time to make the reasoning and requests. feel free to email me to [contact@opendronelog.com](mailto:contact@opendronelog.com) or send me a chat here. I might not reply until morning, as it's quite late here now.\n\nNone of these would have happened only if they sent me this same email before sending the letter.\n\n[The Unfair competition clause I mentioned.](https://preview.redd.it/pg9lktdte4lg1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5c70d0bc7f404477fab42be7e8aab2cbb32725)\n\n[Some demands](https://preview.redd.it/jo3nz51s0alg1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7a65c260432e94cb1c6c08ea495cce0322f6c06)\n\n💜💜 Thanks to the r/drones and r/selfhosted and r/opensource community we were able to reach to this stage in record time. As in individual, you can voice your opinion. It proved again that what opensource communities can do and this thread is a living proof of that.\n\n\\--------\n\n**TL;DR:** I made an [open-source, local-first dashboard for drone flight logs](https://opendronelog.com) because the biggest corporate player in the space locks your older data behind a paywall. They found my GitHub, tracked my Reddit posts, and hit me with a legal notice for \"unfair competition\" and trademark infringement.\n\n**Long version:** I maintain a few small open-source projects. About two weeks ago, I released a free, self-hostable tool that lets drone pilots collect, map, and analyze their flight logs locally. I didn't think much of it, just a passion project with a few hundred users.\n\nI can’t name the company (let's call them \"Company A\") because their legal team is actively monitoring my Reddit account and cited my past posts in their notice. Company A is the giant in this space. Their business model goes like this:\n\n* You can upload unlimited flight logs for free.\n* BUT you can only view the last 100 flights.\n* If you want to see your older data, you have to pay a monthly subscription *and* a $15 \"retrieval fee.\"\n* Even then, you can't bulk download your own logs. You have to click them one by one. They effectively hold your own data hostage to lock you into their ecosystem. I am not sure if they are even GDPR complaint even in the EU\n\nTo help people transition to my open-source tool, I wrote a simple web-based script that allowed users to log into their own Company A accounts and automate the bulk download of their own files. Company A did not like this. They served me with a highly aggressive, 4-page legal demand (CEASE and DESIST notice). They forced me to:\n\n1. Nuke the automated download tool entirely from GitHub.\n2. Remove any mention of their company name from my main open-source project and website (since it’s trademarked). I originally had my tagline as \"The Free open-source \\[Company A\\] Alternative,\" which they claimed was illegally driving their traffic to my site.\n3. Remove a feature comparison chart I made. (I admittedly messed up here, I only compared my free tool to their paid tier and omitted their limited free tier, which they claimed was misleading and defamatory).\n\nI'm just a solo dev, so I complied with the core of their demands to stay out of trouble. I scrubbed their name, took down the downloader, and sanitized my website. My main open-source logbook lives independent of them.\n\nI admit I was naive about the legal aspects of comparison marketing and using trademarked names. But the irony is that they probably spent thousands of dollars on lawyer fees to draft a threat against my small project that makes close to zero money (I got a few small donations from happy users).\n\nHas anyone else here ever dealt with corporate lawyers coming after your self-hosted/FOSS projects? It’s a crazy initiation :)\n\n**EDIT : Lot of people think the company is DJI, it's NOT DJI. I love their drones and their customer service. It's not them.**",

          "text": "why compete on the merits of your product when you can just abuse the legal system to squash competition ensuring the continued enshitification of everything so that some fuckwad executive can pat himself on the back for delivering a fraction of a percent higher investment return to shareholders this quarter. I'm sure these assholes see nothing wrong with their business model too, taking customers hostage and putting a gun to their head is a perfectly reasonable and genuinely honest business model /s.\n\n\nGetting a massive c&d is basically a rite of passage for foss devs tbh. you did the right thing just taking it down, no point bankrupting yourself over a passion project just to fight their soulless lawyer army.\n\nfor the downloader tool, the lawyers always cry about ToS violations and unauthorized access. instead of writing a script that logs in for users, just write a quick guide on how users can pull their own json manually using browser devtools. if the user does it themselves manually they cant really blame your code for hitting their servers.\n\non the trademark stuff just scrub their name completely. stop calling it an alternative to [company] and just say it imports standard drone logs or whatever. same with the comparison chart, corporate lawyers love calling that trade libel if you miss any tiny details like the fact that they did have a free tier (even if its bullshit and unusably restricted, it counts). if you ever put a chart back up just add a massive \"prices as of whatever date, check their site for other tiers\" disclaimer.\n\nthe funniest part is they are 100% violating gdpr in europe if they hold user data hostage behind a $15 retrieval fee or make you click 100 times to export. but yeah, you dont wanna be the one paying to prove that in court.\n\ndefinitely reach out to the electronic frontier foundation, they have a coders rights project for exactly this type of corporate bs. also make sure to scrub your github commit history too, those lawyers are definitely gonna watch you to find anything they can use to nitpick and use against you. don't give them any ammunition and force them to have rationalize their own shittyness and immoral business model without being able to catch you on any technicalities. best way to mic drop on these dicks. keep the project alive man, just make it completely brand agnostic.",

Anyone is able to use “Company A”’s name, *especially* if you are accurately portraying them in a negative light, rather than inaccurately implying you are their business partner.\n\nComparisons to established services is so widespread, that it would be a challenge to find software that does *not* include comparisons to legacy competitors. However, the point of a cease and desist is to effect the company’s goal, regardless of the legal merit of their arguments or whether the lawyer would dare making such a claim in front of a judge.\n\nIt is definitely not in the public interest that this bluster has impeded your ability to compete with their unusual rent-seeking model that is based on throttling their customers’ access to their own personally generated data from flights they commanded. Because it is an open source product that you do for your own enjoyment rather than monetary gain, I don’t know if you can seek damages as a result of them impeding your ability to distribute your product, but their might be similar cases that have occurred with other open source products.",

They smeared an elderly woman in the media attempting to get off the hook for their intentional endangerment.  At that time, a corporate memo showed McDonalds policy dictating super-heating their coffee under pressure to above boiing temperature's so that customers would be unlikely to ask for a free refill.  Not surprisingly, handing paper cups of super-heated liquid to customers was not very safe.  And the result was 3rd degree burns to an 80 year old woman's labia.

A download tool may be ok but it depends on how it works. The US has vague laws about tools that circumvent security. Your use of their company name sounds fine but again it depends on the detail.\n\nRegardless of what you do, I'd create a legal notices directory in the project and add their email in its entirety so anyone who is interested can see how the company operates.",

      "text": "Today, after raising security concerns in a post on r/huntarr regarding the lack of development standards in what looks like a 100% vibe-coded project, I was banned. This made my spidey senses tingle, so I decided to do a security review of the codebase. What I found was... not good. TLDR: If you have Huntarr exposed on your stack, anyone can pull your API keys for Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, and every other connected app without logging in, gaining full control over your media stack.\n\n# The process\n\nI did a security review of Huntarr.io (v9.4.2) and found critical auth bypass vulnerabilities. I'm posting this here because Huntarr sits on top of (and is now trying to replace them as well!) Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, and other *arr apps that have years of security hardening behind them. If you install Huntarr, you're adding an app with zero authentication on its most sensitive endpoints, and that punches a hole through whatever network security you've set up for the rest of your stack.\n\n**The worst one:** `POST /api/settings/general` requires no login, no session, no API key. Nothing. Anyone who can reach your Huntarr instance can rewrite your entire configuration and the response comes back with **every setting for every integrated application** in cleartext. Not just Huntarr's own proxy credentials - the response includes API keys and instance URLs for Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Lidarr, Readarr, Whisparr, and every other connected app. One curl command and an attacker has direct API access to your entire media stack:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST http://your-huntarr:9705/api/settings/general \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"proxy_enabled\": true}'\n```\n\nFull config dump with passwords and API keys for every connected application. If your instance is internet-facing - and it often is, Huntarr incorporates features like Requestarr designed for external access - anyone on the internet can pull your credentials without logging in.\n\n**Other findings (21 total across critical/high/medium):**\n\n- **Unauthenticated 2FA enrollment on the owner account** (Critical, **proven in CI**): `POST /api/user/2fa/setup` with no session returned the actual TOTP secret and QR code for the owner account. An attacker generates a code, calls `/api/user/2fa/verify`, enrolls their own authenticator. Full account takeover, no password needed.\n- **Unauthenticated setup clear enables full account takeover** (Critical, **proven in CI**): `POST /api/setup/clear` requires no auth. Returns 200 \"Setup progress cleared.\" An attacker re-arms the setup flow, creates a new owner account, replaces the legitimate owner entirely.\n- **Unauthenticated recovery key generation** (Critical, **proven in CI**): `POST /auth/recovery-key/generate` with `{\"setup_mode\": true}` reaches business logic with no auth check (returns 400, not 401/403). The endpoint is unauthenticated.\n- **Full cross-app credential exposure** (Critical, **proven in CI**): Writing a single setting returns configuration for 10+ integrated apps. One call, your entire stack's API keys.\n- **Unauthenticated Plex account unlink** - anyone can disconnect your Plex from Huntarr\n- **Auth bypass on Plex account linking** via client-controlled `setup_mode` flag - the server skips session checks if you send `{\"setup_mode\": true}`\n- **Zip Slip arbitrary file write** (High): `zipfile.extractall()` on user-uploaded ZIPs without filename sanitization. The container runs as root.\n- **Path traversal in backup restore/delete** (High): `backup_id` from user input goes straight into filesystem paths. `shutil.rmtree()` makes it a directory deletion primitive.\n- `local_access_bypass` trusts `X-Forwarded-For` headers, which are trivially spoofable - combine with the unauth settings write and you get full access to protected endpoints\n\n**How I found this:** Basic code review and standard automated tools (bandit, pip-audit). The kind of stuff any maintainer should be running. The auth bypass isn't a subtle bug - `auth.py` has an explicit whitelist that skips auth for `/api/settings/general`. It's just not there.\n\n**About the maintainer and the codebase:**\n\nThe maintainer [says](https://i.imgur.com/sjPAT1u.png) they have \"a series of steering documents I generated that does cybersecurity checks and provides additional hardening\" and **\"Note I also work in cybersecurity.\"** They [say](https://i.imgur.com/8AkHZ27.png) they've put in \"120+ hours in the last 4 weeks\" using \"steering documents to advise along the way from cybersecurity, to hardening, and standards\". If that's true, it's not showing in the code.\n\nIf you work in cybersecurity, you should know not to whitelist your most sensitive endpoint as unauthenticated. You should know that returning TOTP secrets to unauthenticated callers is account takeover. You should know `zipfile.extractall()` on untrusted input is textbook Zip Slip. This is introductory stuff. The \"cybersecurity steering documents\" aren't catching what a basic security scan flags in seconds.\n\nLook at the [commit history](https://i.imgur.com/TomsJz0.png): dozens of commits with messages like \"Update\", \"update\", \"Patch\", \"change\", \"Bug Patch\" - hundreds of changed files in commits separated by a few minutes. No PR process, no code review, no second pair of eyes - just raw trunk-based development where 50 features get pushed in a day with zero review. Normal OSS projects are slower for a reason: multiple people look at changes before they go in. Huntarr has none of that.\n\nWhen [called out on this](https://i.imgur.com/dF0Oyst.png), the maintainer said budget constraints: \"With a limited budget, you can only go so far unless you want to spend $1000+. I allot $40 a month in the heaviest of tasks.\" That's just not true - you can use AI-assisted development 8 hours a day for $20/month. The real problem isn't the budget. It's that the maintainer doesn't understand the security architecture they're building and doesn't understand the tools they're using to build it. You can't guide an AI to implement auth if you don't recognize what's wrong when it doesn't.\n\n**They also censor security reports and ban people who raise concerns.** A user posted security concerns on r/huntarr and it was [removed by the moderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/huntarr/comments/1rbtri7/removed_by_moderator/) - the maintainer controls the subreddit. I was banned from r/huntarr after pointing out these issues in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/huntarr/comments/1rccfcd/huntarr_94_released_user_requests_bundling/) where the maintainer was claiming to work in cybersecurity (which they now deleted).\n\nOne more thing - the project's README has a \"Support - Building My Daughter's Future\" section soliciting donations. That's a red flag for me. You're asking people to fund your development while shipping code with 21 unpatched security vulnerabilities, no code review process, and banning people who point out the problems, while doing an appeal to emotion about your daughter. If you need money, that's fine - but you should be transparent about what you're spending it on and you should be shipping code that doesn't put your users at risk.\n\n**Proof repo with automated CI:** https://github.com/rfsbraz/huntarr-security-review\n\nDocker Compose setup that pulls the published Huntarr image and runs a Python script proving each vulnerability. GitHub Actions runs it on every push - check the workflow results yourself or run it locally with `docker compose up -d && python3 scripts/prove_vulns.py`.\n\nFor what it's worth, and to prove I'm not an AI hater, the `prove_vulns` script itself was vibe coded - I identified the vulnerabilities through code review, wrote up the repro steps, and had AI generate the proof script.\n\nFull security review (21 findings): https://github.com/rfsbraz/huntarr-security-review/blob/main/Huntarr.io_SECURITY_REVIEW.md\n\n**What happens next:** The maintainer will most likely prompt these problems away - feed the findings to an AI and ship a patch. But fixing 21 specific findings doesn't fix the process that created them. No code review, no PR process, no automated testing, no one who understands security reviewing what ships. The next batch of features will have the next batch of vulnerabilities. This is only the start. If the community doesn't push for better coding standards, controlled development, and a sensible roadmap, people will keep running code that nobody has reviewed.\n\nIf you're running Huntarr, keep it off any network you don't fully trust until this is sorted. The *arr apps it wraps have their own API key auth - Huntarr bypasses that entirely.\n\nPlease let others know about this. If you have a Huntarr instance, share this with your community. If you know someone who runs one, share it with them. The more people know about the risks, the more pressure there will be on the maintainer to fix them and improve their development process.\n\nEdit: Looks like r/huntarr went private and the repo got deleted or privated https://github.com/plexguide/Huntarr.io . I'm sorry for everyone that donated to this guy's \"Daughter College Fund\".",

I have made 2 lightweight Go containers for qbittorrent - one to give me live updates via ntfy.sh and another to update the port on qbittorrent from gluetun automatically and efficiently, avoiding an ugly infinite loop shell script. All while having superficial Go knowledge (my most exp is Java).\n\nBut at the end of the day they're my own images, built for myself, to standards that I have set - distroless, rootless, as few deps as I reasonably can, auto-update for upstream, and with CI and at least some essential tests. They should never be exposed publicly. If anyone else wants to use any of these - more than welcome, but they're built for myself.\n\nAnd hey, if anyone wants to scrutinize, especially the security - I'll appreciate the free feedback.",

Ports from applications aren't exposed to the host but are available to Nginx so all traffic to an application must go through Nginx.\n\n0 - Only exposed to my own VLAN\n1 - Exposed to myself and my family\n2 - Exposed to all network users\n3 - Exposed publicly\n\nJellyfin will be in level 3 but Huntarr is in level 1. Because no one on my network except for me can access the services these vulnerabilities are of a lower concern. Someone would either have to make Nginx ignore my trusted access list or find a way to get an IP in my VLAN before they could exploit one of these vulnerabilities.\n\nThis is a super simple measure to add to any application to immediately reduce your risk.",

          "text": "Well written, obligatory this is based purely on what OP has written, it'd be nice to hear the other side of the story, my two cents as a SWE:\n\n- I appreciate the time and effort you put into writing this post and validating what are very severe issues. A lot of this is no doubt very easy to get RCE via.\n- Not only is the wrong thing being done, but the correct thing is being aggressively argued against. This is what I call weaponized incompetence and it's the worst position for a developer to be in. \n- Assuming the situation is as written, the developers incompetence is putting users at risk.\n\nThat said:\n\n- A lot of self hosted projects are written by solo developers. Huntarr is no different. Having code review / a second pair of eyes is unattainable because there is nobody to do that.\n- In this case, I think having a second pair of eyes wouldn't have helped. The situation appears to be that the developer is ignoring glaring security issues. They would continue to ignore those security issues regardless of whether they came up in review or on reddit. It's a behavior issue, part of being a good developer is having humility, reading, understanding, and learning from other peoples viewpoints rather than just dismissing them.\n- In general, I would like to not shit on new developers for making security mistakes. Mistakes are something we can repair and learn from. Unfortunately, in this case, the developer appears to be actively refusing to repair and learn from mistakes, so we end up with public disclosure. In an ideal world the developer would learn humility from this and allow more seasoned developers to guide them on how to improve their security practices. This is an opportunity to grow.\n\nMy general recommendations when self hosting:\n\nRemember that these applications are written by solo developers. OP has reviewed this project, but nobody has reviewed any of the others. Developers are often terrible when it comes to security, actively resisting security best practice is common, dunning kruger is also common. I have been banned and or ridiculed in communities while trying to push for reasonable security improvements, just like OP seems to have been. Even big projects that you wouldn't expect. My general recommendations are to run all applications behind and auth proxy and a VPN if you can, with no exposed ports. It's better to assume that the applications are insecure than it is to fall victim to the alternative.",

And I'm not defending the dev's actions nor am I really attacking OP -- he has raised legitimate security concerns that absolutely do make using Huntarr safely impossible.\n\nBut I do think calling the project entirely vibe coded is incorrect and it would piss me off if someone came in with that attitude, even if they shared valid concerns. The pile on in this thread would further frustrate me.\n\nWhat I think happened is this: \n\n\\- Huntarr dev is a legitimate developer who handcoded \"v1\" of Huntarr -- where it was just a file search helper. \n\n\\- The dev started experimenting with Cursor or Claude and realized \"holy shit, I can do so much more so much faster with this work flow\" and didn't have the skills or experience to quality control the code \n\n\\- Rather than taking a beat to quality control and audit the security of the new features that were added on, the dev kept pushing new features, excited by the fact that AI was such a major accellerant to his work flow. This became an additiction, the dopamine rush of each major feature release reinforced by all the attention he got on Reddit and Github with each major release\n\nI think this is much more a cautionary tale about Claude / Cursor than it is a story about a vibecoding grifter who pretended like he knew what he was doing. It doesn't excuse the gaping security holes or the cowardly behavior after the fact, but I do think that potentially a different approach by OP could have yielded a different result on this project.\n\nPersonally, I don't use Huntarr, but I do think its sad that a project ran with the passion that the dev had for it has been bandwagonned to death as if the dev had done something malicious.",

Firefox comes default with the Cira DoH [1] that was effectively bypassing my local DNS because the browser never used the system DNS resolver via port 53 instead it directly queried the DoH port 443 which got slipped through the cracks of firewall for good reasons lol (pun intended).\n\nNow when I block DoH servers from the firewall then the browser fell back to the old school DNS \n\nLinks:\n1. https://www.cira.ca/en/canadian-shield/configure/chrome/",

That's not to say there aren't problems with AI solutions. \n\nNamely:\n1. They tend not to scale well - AI is good at beelining for a working solution but doesn't have the human ability to intelligently optimize a design to be easy to work on in the future or performant (necessarily)\n2. They can suffer from deep security issues that you may not even be aware of (similar reasons to above)\n3. Fundamentally, you're missing out on the learning process of creating something and therefore both miss the opportunity to up skill and risk creating something you don't understand and therefore cannot support\n4. It's easy to very quickly pump out crap that looks passable on the surface, making it much harder overall to curate good software.\n\nBUT\n\nIf you're designing a simple app that doesn't need to scale or be secure (it's primarily designed for a simple internal usage and doesn't handle sensitive data), and if you're not interested/don't have time to really learn how to do something but just need a quick solution that doesn't exist already and aren't trying to market it as something that it isn't - *I do not see the issue in using this as a means to an end*. It solves a problem. It does something useful for OP. OP is honest about the use of AI and doesn't promise amazing support or market themselves as a great coder.

YouTube's algorithm isn't malicious, but it IS single-mindedly focused on watch time. Building your own gatekeeping layer is exactly the kind of solution the self-hosted community excels at.\n\nThe Telegram integration for instant approval is smart UX - it keeps the friction low for the parent while maintaining the gate. And the channel allowlisting with time limits by category shows this was built from real parenting experience, not theoretical concerns.\n\nNice work on the security considerations too - non-root container, rate limiting, SSRF prevention.

That’s normal.\n\nVibe coding isn’t about avoiding learning — it’s about compressing the discovery phase. If I need something working today, spending a week digging through docs and Stack Overflow isn’t some moral victory. Time is money, and shipping matters.\n\nAlso, this idea that it’s “not faster” just doesn’t line up with reality. Getting a rough but functional implementation in minutes, then reading it, understanding it, and modifying it, is often far quicker than starting from a blank file. I still have to understand the code to maintain it — the learning happens either way.\n\nThe “commissioning an artist” analogy doesn’t really hold up either. Programming isn’t art — it’s engineering. If I specify requirements, constraints, inputs, outputs, and then validate, test, and integrate the result, that’s no different than using:\n\na framework\n\na code generator\n\na compiler\n\na boilerplate template\n\nNobody says you didn’t “really code” because you used requests instead of writing a TCP stack.\n\nAnd yes, learning Python is great — I do that constantly — but pretending the only valid way to learn is the slowest possible one is just romanticizing inefficiency. In the real world, professionals balance learning, tooling, and delivery.",

Let's not forget docker uses the host's kernel.\n\nEither way: kernel update = downtime. Arch updates the kernel pretty often. As is, more than once a week. Sure you don't *have* to update your system that often, but I guess if someone picks arch, then surely that must be something they are after. But then again, they use it as a docker host so that's pretty conflicting.\n\nI too use Arch and I too at some point thought it was simpler to just stick to the one distro I'm the most familiar with but really nothing beats having the right tool for the job. Just go with a stable LTS distro, slap the docker repos on it, configure unattended upgrades to your liking, schedule some periodic reboots and forget about it.",

              "text": "When one of my early servers died, it was basically a nightmare both because i didn't really have any backup of the server install (media was fine) so it took me a couple of days to rebuild it with all of the dependency and installation management, and then all of the configuration for all of the services. At that time, I built it in a VM instead and started snapshotting, but that also had some downsides. Updates could still be fraught and break stuff, and snapshotting took up a lot more backup space than I would have liked.\n\nDocker and docker-compose make that a bajillion times easier. Dependency management is gone and it basically becomes as easy to add services as it is to grab something from the app store. Docker compose also means that I don't need to backup anything other than my docker-compose.yaml and the config directories for the services I use, so that's just a git repo that I push when there are changes. So if I lost my media server today, I could basically install whatever distro (most server distros are going to come out of the box with docker and git) do a ``git pull`` and ``docker-compose up -d`` and I'm off to the races. It would probably take less than a half hour for me to go from bare metal to my server as it runs today. Well, maybe slightly more depending on internet speed. \n\nI'd suggest people check out [Yet Another Media Server](https://yams.media/) if you want to dip your toes in. It's basically a script that sets up docker-compose with the typical *arr stack, plex/emby/jellyfin, and at least torrents with easy integration of VPN.",

Very portable in that you can just copy it over to another system and other than having docker you don't need to set anything else up in the host OS and it will just run... Usually. Hardware requirements are still a thing\n\nNot amazing from an efficiency standpoint as you might end up running multiple copies of the same dependency for multiple applications that could all just be using the same underlying software packages.

I had experimented with them in a test environment in the past, and I always found the immutability quite limiting. However, recently I built a new flash-based NAS with a ZimaBoard 2 1664 as the beating heart. It obviously came with Zima OS installed, and after a lot of internal debate I decided to stick with it instead of installing an alternative. So far I have really enjoyed it. There definitely are limitations that I have had to work around, and I have installed Entware to get some packages that are not natively installed. I haven't run into anything I wanted to do and couldn't, though. I have always found a way to make it work.",

I mean there are a lot of literature, but you will still be dealing with buffering, codecs, nat piercing, slow connections. It is just a can of worms, a lot of added complexity that will trigger users whenever it doesnt work correctly. Streaming and encoding also takes a lot of cpu and you will have some potatoes pc out there. Do you also stream and full hd, but consume in what? Usually you will have to separate streams by resolution, so you dont stream 4k to a pc configured to receive 720p, meaning you have to buffer multiple times. How much you buffer as well, how does the clients catch up with delayed transmissions, what controls the user has when it is receiving transmission. Do you allow people to share the screen? What do you do with the audio of the transmission if the person is sharing the screen. Etc etc",

          "text": "No it's more because Element isn't built to replace Discord, it's a more commercial aimed client that also fits some needs of people who use WhatsApp a lot.\n\nMatrix itself may never be able to become a protocol that can support a Discord clone precisely because of Element and the fact that a bunch of security organisations use it and as Element is led by the people that made Matrix I don't think they are going to make crazy changes so Matrix can support more niche Discord features when I am sure a decent portion of the 185M users are corporate.\n\nIf it works for you then that's great. I'm sure if you have a small group of very employed, not that terminally online and non-stubborn people then moving everyone over to a Matrix based client would be fine to use as a group chat where you can get in a group call and play a game once a week. But for the people that use Discord like Discord I (sadly) don't think Element using Matrix is or will be a serious replacement.\n\n  \nI would like some form of decentralised self-host platform to win out though. I am not blindly hating on Matrix and did and still do want it to succeed but after trying to do this months ago it wasn't a fit. I just don't see how anything other than self hosted can be a real replacement for Discord because moving from one centralised service to another is not worth annoying your friends over.",

However you can't cancel single events and deleting an event crashes the app.\n\nIt's the same for a lot of this Matrix or Discord clone stuff, I hope it pops off but has too many small issues to properly switch. Stoat still doesn't have the ability to use push to talk/mute or a key bind to mute and I made a feature request for that in 2021.",

They also have end to end encryption for chat messages. \n\nOverall Matrix is okay if you want a chatting and simple voice call and video streaming.\n\nTeamSpeak 6 is dead simple on both set up and using it. there's no chat room you have to get on a voice call everytime you wanted to use it. \n\nIt only allows 32 people maximum so this might be a problem if you got more than 32 friends (you can't even convince your friends to use Matrix or TeamSpeak anyways lol)\n\nIt's also has file size limited to 10mb and I can not find a way to change it if someone know please tell me.\n\nThe good side is since TeamSpeak is just Team and Speak it's very very lightweight on both server-side and client-side.\n\nAudio and Video streaming is as good as you can get. You can have 320kbps audio and 4k60 fps for free (might be more, depends on your system rigs and internet, Video streaming are p2p)\n\nOverall TeamSpeak 6 is good when you do not care about anything at all but a minimal app to just team and speak with your friends. Good audio and video quality,  file upload sucks, can't have more than 32 people.\n\nThat's it for now I guess, if you want a TRUE DISCORD experience then sadly there're none. Well there're Stoat (formerly Revolt) bur it's kinda sucks for now.",

The documentation gives you an example nginx config with the whole CORS thing being a simple comment below. \"But Element is a desktop app. It wouldn't need that anyway. Also it's just a comment below and not included as part of the example config. So it's irrelevant. I'll just forget about it.\" So you copy it believing it's complete and end up troubleshooting the whole 3-container config structure ad nauseum until you realize you can just do ctrl+shift+i in the chromium tab that calls itself app to find out it's fucking CORS.\n\nThat CORS thing, and the multi-container config nightmare, and the push notification app requirement thing are three separate blunders that make an otherwise cool and exciting thing a very frustrating experience.",

Instead of making each \"add-on\" a specific price, they have a stupid coin system that you have to buy in their pre-determined increments.\n\nI don't remember the exact numbers anymore, but the most common setup for most people would be using the radarr (500 pts), sonarr (500 pts) and torrent downloader (300 pts) add-ons for a total of 1,300 points. But they don't sell a bundle for 1,300 points, they sell one for 1,000 and then one for like 500, or something like that. So there's no way to pay exactly for what you want in that scenario. As soon as I saw that I uninstalled the app.",

So there won't be any duplicates when you use SparkuyFitnessMobile app to sync it.\n\nBut for Fitbit vs android its different.\n\nIf you sync with Fitbit and again with android which is also sync with fitbit, there is some chance you might end up with duplicates based on what data you are sync. Things like weight, height, steps etc are per day entries. so whichever is sync last will stay. but things like workout or exercise could become duplicate if same workout or exercise are sync from both fitbit & android app.\n\nLike if you text and email someone same info, it will be received by the receiver twice isn't it . so same issue here as well.  I need to figure out how to avoid duplicates.\n\nIf fitbit and android shares common ID for the things sync between fitbit and android, we can have a logic to avoid duplicates.\n\nIf you sync your fitbit to android phone and then sync android to sparkyfitness, there wont be any duplicates.",

All I get is a list of irrelevant things. \n\nAnother example: I want to add something as \"quick food\" because it's a one time meal and if I import the meal by using CSV setting the flag it's not added to my daily food, I cannot search it in the meals to add it manually afterwards, but it's still there because if I want to reimport the CSV it says there is already food with that title.\n\nSo what I want to say: Yes, the idea of a selfhosted MyFitnessPal is super cool and I love it.

Except they weren't, all they did is use ready-built tools to bodge together things without even properly learning the coding part. The funny part? They sucked at the analytics part too.\n\nIt's an old problem, just made worse because the industry got popular and a \"lower\" barrier of entry. Same goes with sub-par software and the explosion of uselessness in programming (see 3 bazillions of npm dependencies).\n\nIt'll die out eventually, the market is saturated.

However, after these stages, it can quickly shrink down to only take up 10-30% of the total work.\n\nSoftware Engineering is as much developer stuff, as is coordinating people (which also takes a hefty amount of social skills at a certain point), political stuff with stake holders, and architecturing something that's (according to your foresight) will be able to solve the issues you're facing today and tomorrow.\n\nAI may pose a major shift, like it hasn't happened since the switch from Assembly to higher languages like C. It's going to stay however, because it's actually good writing small-ish pieces of code - Yet again, look above, that's a surprisingly small part of the job.\n\nI'll leave it at that for this sub :)\n\nBut for what you should be concerned about: You're building that project for yourself first, and everyone else second. In fact, having many users in a open source project poses a dilemma many maintainers of major projects would love to be without. So, just continue, if just for yourself. And if someone likes your project, he'll give a star, maybe even contribute. And if not? Who cares, you did solve **your** issue :)",

In the wrong hands it's scary.  AI needs guidance. There is a place for mentors like this, both for AI and vibe coders.

But the smarter crawlers rotate IPs and user agents constantly, so IP-based blocking only catches the lazy ones.\n\n  \nPoison fountains work on a completely different layer. The bot successfully crawls your site, thinks it got useful data, and feeds garbage into its training pipeline. By the time anyone notices, the damage is baked into the model weights.\n\n  \nI run both on my setup. CrowdSec with the community blocklist handles maybe 80% of the noise. The remaining 20% that gets through hits a tarpit with poisoned content served from a hidden path. The Anthropic research someone linked above is exactly why - even small amounts of bad data can wreck a dataset disproportionately.\n\n  \nOne thing worth adding: if you're using nginx, you can also check the robots.txt compliance first and only serve poison to bots that ignore it. That way legitimate crawlers (search engines etc) aren't affected.",

I've noticed a somewhat exasperating trend among younger folks with regard to Discord in that they don't seem to understand the distinction between a \"chat\" platform and a \"text forum\" type. One professional subreddit I'm a member of that's private and requires verification changed mods a couple years ago, and the new mod inexplicably decided he was deprecating the subreddit and replacing it with a Discord server. When objections were raised he admitted the lack of threads and the near impossibility of finding answers in the history was \"an issue\", but he pressed on regardless.\n\nMy personal theory is that we're seeing a generation of people who grew up with a cell phone in their hand, so their first experience of networked communication was via some sort of text message or chat app. As a result, everything on the internet, including persistent text forums like Reddit, they treat it like a chat portal. Another subreddit I'm on had a meta post suggesting that the subreddit turn off the bot that copies the body of the main post into the first comment  because \"people like to be able to delete their old posts\", completely failing to understand that the great strength and arguably the *purpose* of a persistent text forum is the ability to look back and find information. It certainly explains a lot of the question posts you see everywhere that Google would have returned the exact answer as a top result, if only they'd typed their post title into Google.",

          "text": "Our group has basically done the exact same path as yours has, and with similar conclusions. \n\nI used to host a few of Revolt (now Stoat) servers a while ago during The Great Discord Exodus Round 1.  \nThe tech stack was fragile - and looking at it again now - has made almost no visible progress. \nTheir hosted solution was unusable and broken. And I was not interested in jumping back into hosting that again either so we moved on to other options. \n\nMatrix ended up not being an option. \nThe people wanted their Emojis, Gifs, and Calls. Of all the matrix clients - none support all 3. We moved on.\n\nWe took a look at Root - but their TOS was a instant pass. We did not even try installing it. It just looks like a trap with a draconian view of users. \n\nWe're leaning on Fluxer for our future space and are currently spending a lot of time there while we see how things move. \n\nSo far - its everything we wanted with a few bugs that are getting worked out. \n\n---\n\nFor your list of wants - here's my experience with Fluxer over the last couple days: \n\n**Hard requirements:**\n\n* Discord-like Onboarding UX \n  * The experience is nearly 1:1 for Discord onboarding\n  * We re-made most of our channels and users just joined without issue. \n* Multiple text and voice chat channels\n  * Supported. \n* Decent Mobile Experience\n  * Currently only available as PWA - Mobile apps expected in 1-2 Months per the Developer chats. \n  * It's not great - but is good enough for now. \n* Self-hostable\n  * Currently yes - although opaque. \n  * Docker based Self Hosted methods are \"coming soon\"\n\n**Nice to have:**\n\n* Free and Open Source (FOSS)\n  * Yes - and public development / PR Opens should begin soon according to the Dev.\n* Minimal Vibecoding\n  * The Developer addressed this in [This blog post](https://blog.fluxer.app/how-i-built-fluxer-a-discord-like-chat-app). \n  * Their response seemed acceptable and believable to me. \n  * Using the app - it does not feel vibe-coded. \n* End-to-end Encryption\n  * Currently no - Opt-in is on the roadmap. \n  * Personal opinion - this is not actually wanted for a service like this. In concept it sounds nice. More encryption == more better right? In practice - you'll see more of the complaints of many people bitten by Matrix-style flubs where their messages disappear, or only some people can see others. For 1:1 messages, this is a good thing to have. But for large public spaces - it offers little benefit and a lot of potential for failures.\n* TTL-ed messages\n  * [Yes - for messages with files](https://fluxer.app/help/en-us/articles/1447193503661555712-how-attachment-expiry-works-on-fluxer)\n  * Semi related - A deletion clause is present in the [Privacy Policy](https://fluxer.app/privacy#7-data-retention)\n* Screensharing and video chat\n  * Yes, and does it well. Some of the larger calls I've been in had dozens of people, and many screenshares. Overall it was stable and clear. The ability to see multiple streams at once was also a nice touch. \n\n\nOur plan at the moment is to use the Fluxer.app main server - and then poll the group about whether or not to self-host once the refactor is complete. Our group is much smaller and more tight-knit so these kinds of moves are pretty easy for us. This is not meant to tell you \"Move all your users to fluxer right nao!\" - just providing some insight on my experience over the last few days, and my overall mood on the project is optimistic. \n\nRight now I'm just following the dev chats and the [Github](https://github.com/fluxerapp/fluxer) and seeing where the ride goes.",

Took a bit of poking around to get it all up and running, and it was definitely not lightweight, as mentioned. I ended up allocating a 8c 16Gb machine to get it stood up - and had some concerns about long-term stability on what's currently available in the github. It was not \"hard\", as most of what you need is in the compose. But some knowledge of initializing the databases is needed to get everything flowing. \n\nI did also chat with the Developer a bit in the Dev channels on their main server, and while they have quite a bit of work to hit the goals they've stated, they do seem achievable, especially with a little help. Overall they seemed competent, if not a little ambitious. \n\nAs far as the licencing goes - it doesn't seem too odd to me off the bat. But I also work in the FOSS space, so licencing like this is not an immediate red flag for me. You aren't wrong to be skeptical, but in my experience there are plenty of projects both small business and big that have free self-hosted models and a paid hosted option, with licences similar or equal to this. But you're correct that some caution is warranted for something so new. \n\nPersonally - I buy the premise of funding early for a \"good enough\" product to avoid external investment and solidify cashflow to develop and expand. I would be very surprised to see this be a rugpull, but I'm also not too concerned as I have very little to lose in that situation. If their plans do come to fruition I expect that I will maintain both a paid account on their main instance and a self-hosted one as well. \n\nI did buy into the membership as a sign of support for the project, and so far I feel good about that. If I end up a fool though... oh well I have made costlier mistakes. \n\nOverall though - so far so good.",

Similar to the blog author I've tried spinning up a lot of the various options and come away unimpressed with most of them, but using Fluxer feels like it's well thought out and very intentional, and doesn't give me the sense it was vibe coded (unlike many of the others).\n\nIn regards to E2EE encryption I agree with you as well, and the blog post you mention covers the developers awareness of the issues that Matrix has had with that very issue. I'd like to see a roadmap for Fluxer include E2EE (opt in) for private messages, but it's not the most pressing issue.\n\n>Our plan at the moment is to use the Fluxer.app main server - and then poll the group about whether or not to self-host once the refactor is complete. Our group is much smaller and more tight-knit so these kinds of moves are pretty easy for us. This is not meant to tell you \"Move all your users to fluxer right nao!\" - just providing some insight on my experience over the last few days, and my overall mood on the project is optimistic. \n\nSame here, spun up a test server and getting people logged into the system to make sure it works, but looking to self host once that update rolls out. The expectation here too is that Discord will still be used in parallel for things like large community servers which take much longer to figure out their move, or may even remain on Discord, but that the information you reveal to Discord is minimized to whatever you're comfortable putting on public servers.",

          "text": "I've got a matrix server that's only two days old but we've already pulled in 40 of our most active discord users and my discord server (700 users) is now a ghost town. Onboarding was relatively painless other than myself not being totally clear in my explanation of how rooms and spaces work and not realizing that users would have trouble finding rooms that aren't auto joined, in some apps. We've been digging in on the privacy and security and access control features quite heavily, and I have to say my users are extremely pleased with that aspect, and don't seem too bothered by the recovery key and multi-device verification hoops. Even the non-techies seem to consider it a completely acceptable trade-off to truly own their data, be able to speak more freely about current events and personal matters without corpo and authorities looking over their shoulder, and have privacy even from me, the admin.\n\nThe various desktop and mobile apps all have their shortcomings. None of them are as comfy and cozy as discord, and in my short hands-on experience so far, each of them seems to be lacking some feature or convenience that one of the others provides. Personally I find fluffy or schildichat the most comfortable mobile experience and element best on desktop. \n\nI have intentionally left voice and video functionality disabled for now, and intend to dig in later this week. So I can't speak to that, but I really hope that it doesn't become the downfall of what seems to be a decent little private server. We rarely use it but when we want it, it needs to be there. I don't mind doing the heavy lifting to figure it out and make it work, I'm not mad if it's extra steps or requires a bit of maintenance. I accepted that when I volunteered to host all this for the community. \n\nIt was an easy deployment overall. I spent 2 months of on and off research and dabbling on a test instance, set up in various ways including some of the docker and Helm approaches, with a non-techie friend. I started fresh about 28 hours before scheduled launch. Straight Debian packages, a lot of googling, and about 16 hours of setup, documentation and onboarding guide, and hands-on user education on a livestream, and we were rocking. I was able to onboard dozens of users in the first couple of hours, technical issues have been far more minimal than I expected, and my dread and anxiety have turned to excitement and hope.\n\nResource usage has been much lower than OP's experience. We are currently running on a 4 vCPU 8gb VPS I pay 6/mo for. I will move everything in-house after I myself have moved house, I didn't want downtime for users or extra steps to temporarily migrate to VPS while I rebuild my lab, when that happens. With 40 users we are sitting at less than 1gb RAM - and it barely budged at all when we went from 0 to 40 so I'm pretty confident it's not going to balloon when a couple hundred lurkers have come over. CPU usage has remained around 10 to 15%, only spiking when new accounts are created, not budging at all even during very active discussions and media shares.\n\nOverall I'm not 100% satisfied but it's more than good enough, to all appearances so far. My users say they feel more comfortable, more respected, less exposed, and more tightly knit than we were before. They also seem to really appreciate the work that went in, saying they feel it demonstrates I value our community, and that this experimental migration has increased our collective trust even more. \n\nSo there we have it, just my own early-days experiences. I hope everyone finds an option that works for them, to create a home for the people and the things they care about.",

Because of this slow development people have gotten more engrained in Discord.

I liked Mattermost because of the UI, available apps and ability to expand with the use of plugins.\n\n  \nFluxer - The UI looks very similar to Discord, and as far as I have been able to tell, it looks like it'll function if not the same, very similar to Discord. The devs seem to be very engaged, and as far as I'm concerned - since Discord has announced that they will be doing the BS teen accounts, the devs seemed to have stepped it up with trying to get documentation and refactoring done as quickly as they can. That makes me feel like they care about their community.\n\nBoth are open source and great choices, but I've ran Mattermost and quit as soon as they started paywalling things, or at least the VoIP plugin I think it was. I am now locked in and waiting for Fluxer to have documentation out so that I can make that swap.\n\nMy backup plan is Root chat.",

                  "text": "Going through it I've found a couple of reasons to not use a Matrix frontend for a Discord replacement:\n\n- Ease of use for non-techies/non-power users: setup of your account and server is fairly non-intuitive, and comes with a number of decisions about where you place your home that are potentially difficult to undo or change.\n\n- E2EE failures are highly visible failures: even if they're uncommon, if you've got an active community and suddenly you can't use the space you created you're going to create distrust with the stability and viability of that platform. If you're going to use E2EE it's got to be rock solid or you risk people fleeing the platform for something that \"just works\".\n\n- Federation exposes spaces to risk: Cross contamination of content between spaces means that your hosted space could get illegal content cached on it. While federation is optional to some degree, if you're not doing it then you're missing out on the benefits of the system as a whole and may as well run something else.\n\n- Difficulty in administering federated spaces: tooling and permissions for federated spaces are limited in what you can do for your own space to limit the above risk, not because the tools aren't powerful enough but because by it's nature federation makes it difficult to manage and remove spaces. Some of the more granular settings are also somewhat opaque in what is being shared where (like federated vs. non-federated rooms within a space).\n\n- What happens when a federated space is deleted: There's a [fun blog post](https://blog.erethon.com/blog/2023/06/21/what-happens-when-a-matrix-server-disappears/) on this subject, but in that case they spun it back up and were able to get things running (with some hiccups). It seems like if a homeserver is deleted or removed (and doesn't come back), the users attached to that homeserver no longer exist. Your account is gone and you, as a user, have no way to get it back. This ties back to the first point about decisions that are hard to undo or change, one of which is where you register your homeserver.\n\nThese aren't reasons to pick Fluxer specifically, but they're why I (and my group) decided against going with a Matrix solution after doing some research and testing.",

We don't ask you to disclose this, since we assume you're acting in good faith: you're the one who signs off on the patch you submit in your own name, and you have the technical understanding to verify that it's accurate.  \nThat said, don't use LLMs on areas of the codebase you don't understand well enough to verify the output. If part of your change touches code you aren't confident reviewing yourself, say so in the issue you opened beforehand and defer that work to someone else. The maintainers will be happy to help.",

It's much more optimized at this time, with a lightweight server being able to hold upwards of 3000 members, and the new MatrixRTC calling stack scaling to the hundreds easily.\n\nLook at Element Server Suite and also matrix-docker-ansible-deploy.\n\nIf you've tried Element in the past, that's a work/enterprise focused client even though it's historically been the reference client, and yeah, for mainstream adoption the UX just isn't there, but it wasn't designed for that either. This is why I'd recommend Commet now.\n\nFun Fact: [Rocket.Chat](http://Rocket.Chat) is also integrating Matrix-Federated communication.",

Reddit-style posts with upvotes and nested comments, and admins can flip a toggle to make individual forums publicly readable and indexable by search engines. Seems like that solves the \"information goes to die in Discord\" problem without needing a separate Discourse instance. Also building real search with operators (from:, in:, has:, before:) because Discord's search being broken is genuinely unforgivable at this point.

I had very frustrating experiences before I understood where Matrix is at in their developments. They have made a ton of changes, and that's why all these new features need Element's web client to work (a weird hybrid atm), and Element X on mobile. That's really how things are right now, but the video chat is impressive when you use the right clients. It wont always be this way.\n\nI disagree that it's \"back where we started with Discord\" because Matrix is nowhere near as mature as Discord, and if it was it wouldn't be the abomination that is.\n\nMatrix has been hard at work trying to implement features to compete with Discord. Yes, you need to use the specific clients right now, but that's no different than Discord.\n\nYou can wait for all these alpha platform projects to develop, but in that same time Matrix will get their game together.\n\nI wish you the best. Unless you shut down the Discord server completely, people will stay there. Those people are Discord people. Most of them.\n\nYou can downvote me for that opinion, I have experience with lots of large communities but I don't care to share my identity openly here.",

Around 20-30 use discord. \n\nThere isn't a valid alternative for discord. \n\nI tested stout, that project is just waiting to die. I tested matrix, there are underlying issues on matrix and the major client Element has a terrible UI/UX. \n\nI looked into the rest of the lot that floated to the surface, none is mature enough or old enough to be taken seriously at this time. \n\nI heard about fluxxer or whatever and didn't bother going deeper as it's clearly not ready as well. \n\nAfter this discord wake up call, be able to self host is the bare minimum I will look for. I don't give a shit about threads, forum never stopped existing, I don't even need that much the chats, discourse already have those (with link preview, custom emotes and gif) for example. I need a clear working voice chat and screen sharing and no, TS6 is not the answer with their ridiculous price package.\n\nThe only real big problem with discourse is that if you start accumulating a big database, it will struggle and you'll need a beefy machine. We have roughly 21GB in the posts table and are in the process of migrating out of a 30GB, 8 Threads, 200GB nvme machine because the RAM is just not enough.\n\nEdit: read it and yeah. agree with the general feeling. Also, great write up anyway. I'd appreciate a follow up if you ever decide to monitor this topic.\n\nI honestly think the FOSS space should focus on a video sharing, group call, voice solution rather than a full discord self hosting one. \n\nModern forums are basically like chats and even have chats included... plus, bonus, you can search what is discussed in a web search, unless you decide to set it to private. \nThey already satisfy PLENTY of the text chat side of discord.",

Guilded (now owned by Roblox) is better for gaming but not self-hosted.\n\n**For tech/dev communities:** Matrix (Element) is the clear winner. Federation is genuinely useful, E2EE works, and the bridge ecosystem means you can connect to Discord/Slack/IRC without abandoning existing users. The UX is improving but still rough.\n\n**For small friend groups:** Rocket.Chat or Mattermost if you want Slack-like. But honestly, a simple XMPP server with Conversations/Dino clients is underrated — rock solid, lightweight, and the protocol is 25+ years battle-tested.\n\n**For voice specifically:** Mumble is still unbeatable for low-latency voice. Nothing self-hosted touches it for quality.\n\nThe hard truth: nothing fully replaces Discord because Discord's moat isn't features — it's network effects. Your friends are there. The biggest challenge with any alternative is convincing people to actually switch.\n\nMy setup: Matrix for persistent chat + Mumble for voice + bridges to everywhere else. Not pretty, but it works and I own my data.",

                  "text": "As far as I can tell the study focused on Bitwarden, Lastpass and Dashlane because the source code was (partially) available and they are the most popular password mangers (apart from platform integrated ones from Google, Apple, etc.). They only performed an \"initial analysis\" of 1Password in the appendix. According to the key hierarchy in the paper it uses RSA-OAEP to store the vault key without any authentication of the ciphertext. The study describes a vault substitution attack exploiting this which allows a malicious server to replace your vault with completely attacker controlled data and allows the attacker to obtain any secrets stored in the vault after the attack. The impact of this attack is in my opinion worse than a combination of two attacks on Bitwarden (BW08 and BW11) and is even simpler than the corresponding Bitwarden attacks. The lack of authentication of (public) keys for vault sharing features is the source for a lot of the vulnerabilities in Bitwarden, Lastpass and Dashlane and is also present in 1Password (even ackknowledged in their security whitepaper). So while the study seems to not have investigated this issue in depth like for the other password managers, I think it is very likely that similar attacks are also possible in 1Password since the underlying issue is also present there. While Bitwarden for example has implemented mitigations for these attacks and is working on implementing key authentication, 1Password considers these attacks to be \"arising from already known architectural limitations\" and seems to not be interested in improving this. \n\nSo I think the lack of findings for 1Password is not because their security architecture and key hierarchy is better (imo it is significantly worse due to the use of RSA instead of authenticated AES for your own vault key) but rather because the study did not investigate 1Password in depth like the others because it is closed source, less popular and aware of the issues already (but not fixing it).",

Running it in Docker takes about 5 minutes and uses minimal resources — I've had mine running on a Pi for over a year with zero issues.\n\nThe real security analysis people should be doing isn't \"which cloud provider do I trust more\" but \"what's my actual threat model?\" For most people, the biggest risk isn't a sophisticated attack on their password manager's encryption — it's phishing, credential reuse, and not using 2FA. Any password manager, even a mediocre one, is infinitely better than the sticky note on the monitor approach.\n\nThat said, LastPass's breach response was genuinely terrible and they deserve every bit of criticism. But the lesson isn't \"password managers are unsafe\" — it's \"choose one that doesn't store your vault metadata unencrypted.\"",

If you're running Vaultwarden on your own box behind WireGuard and only using it solo, most of these attack vectors just don't apply to you.\n\nThe web client issue is the real takeaway though. If your server gets popped and you log in through the browser, the server can just serve you whatever JS it wants. Doesn't matter how good the crypto is at that point. Native clients and the browser extension don't have this problem since they're not served by the backend.\n\nHonestly for personal use, KeePassXC with the database on Syncthing has always been the simplest threat model. No server to compromise at all — just an encrypted blob that gets synced peer-to-peer. The tradeoff is convenience, but if you're already comfortable with a terminal, it's not much of one.",

              "text": "> I don't really understand why seemingly nobody else has taken this approach in their password manager, I guess as always everyone wants your data tied to their services.\n\nI wrote a script like this ages ago and used it for years. There are big issues with this approach unfortunately. The biggest is that if you need a way to change passwords that have been compromised the only way to do that is to remember that you have chosen a different input for this particular site or to change the password for every site.\n\nAnother issue I ran into is that different services have different acceptable password criteria. So if the algorithm always generates a 12 character password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters you will run into services that do not accept special characters or have a strict length requirement that your output does not match. I solved this by adding switches to customize the output, but again I needed to remember which sites I enabled those switches for.\n\nMy script used an algorithm salted with a long string of random characters, then required an input of a \"master password\" and an custom input per site. Usually I would use something like \"reddit\" or \"google\" but quickly ran into another issue which was that I have multiple reddit and google accounts, so for some sites I had to use username+site and others just the site - another piece of data to remember.\n\nIn the end I found a password manager to be more flexible and solve all of these problems, while adding the tiny risk that someone could steal my vault. But someone could already steal my script, and discovering my inputs would not be impossible for someone who was targeting me.",
