It worked great. I tagged it as “Built with AI” and shared it here.\n\nIt's a basic utility script, and I didn’t think it was a big deal, but I quickly found out otherwise. I was personally attacked and accused of posting “AI slop,” and also by the “Git-stapo” for being lazy and not learning GIT commands (fair enough). Someone mentioned it shouldn't be under /selfhosted.

There's no real review in place either.\n\nUses CalVer instead of semver, so breaking changes are abound, I can't quite recall if there was a change log in place but pretty sure some changes I encountered weren't covered I found them via git blame / history.\n\nIssues aren't available, he decided to delegate to community instead. I reported a bug about a recent change and there's been no interaction for weeks.\n\nHe's been embracing NIH syndrome by vibe coding tools like `fnox` (secrets management or something like that IIRC) instead of integrating with the community and what's well established there.\n\nOne project claims that he stole their own apparently vibe coded project as a base, but IIRC it was previously used and then he had his AI tools create a new alternative from scratch based on the existing integration API and any changes he wanted. There wasn't any forking done, nor attempt to collaborate.\n\nThe dev is quite confident in the security of it and that it's trustworthy, yet given all the other tools he's vibe coding and the PRs that come along to fix regression slop (tests fail but he still merges the PRs), it's not giving much faith.\n\nHe seems to be slowly replacing any of the ecosystem he integrated with and removing those past integrations. Those that have multiple backend options still aren't consistent with some features or lack a global ENV (only offering backend specific ENV for config common between the two), it's also looking like it's trying to do way too much with the feature sprawl.\n\nAnd yet... It technically is one of the few OSS options out there that can do a variety of things you'd want in a tool. I am just conflicted about it because I've seen the development process and find that rather concerning to rely on or trust security wise. There's tonnes of praise  `mise` is popular but is it contribution friendly? How much of it is AI slop?

Then I hit a bug from an update and realised I couldn't raise an issue (I did file a detailed report via discussions, but no engagement for weeks so far).\n\nThen trying to look through the source and git blame to identify the cause I found the PR change and subsequent regression fix, but after seeing the dev process and code base I just did not feel like I even wanted to contribute further and questioned if this was really a tool worth adopting (it is very capable compared to alternatives, but is getting feature sprawl, and vibe coded security tooling when they're not a dev with notable security background to my knowledge so their confidence in it is questionable).\n\nMost vibe coded projects I expect won't survive as long, I think there's a tendency to build but not maintain (boring), so after some time the dev moves on to something new / shiny and abandons it.\n\nNot sure about that being the case with projects like mise which does have a tonne of github stars, but I'm also a bit weary of these kind that do become well established despite their flaws.",

Even if you review and understand every line in your codebase. Or if you use the AI to write the readme/docs.\n\nTo others, vibe coded is a label of poor quality. It has a meaning like slop. The creator doesn't understand what has been created and it is likely filled with quality issues.\n\nIt seems like both meanings are being applied to the same label. But the difference between the two is so vast that it destroys the purpose of the label.\n\nFrom what I can tell, this sub uses the first definition. If you've used AI at any point of your process, you must label your post \"vibe coded\" or else the mods will remove it.\n\nIt is a shame, because in 2026 there is no serious software work being done without the assistance of AI somewhere in the process.\n\nIt also concerns me how many people seem to base their opinion on AI code from their experience with free-tier chatgpt from 2 years ago. The tools have only gotten better, and using chatgpt to code is not how it's done in the industry today. Plus folks have learned to use the AI tools better.\n\nThere is a large influx of slop in this sub (and the internet as a whole). But I think folks are directing their energy in the wrong direction. It isn't AI code that is problematic, it is the quality of the code. It is the attitudes and behaviors of the authors. These things exist with or without AI, and can be concretely addressed.",

That can happen regardless of whether a project is vibe coded or not.\n\nIf I like a project but feel it doesn’t meet my security standards, I can modify it myself.\n\nAnyway, I feel that a lot of this hate(not saying that’s your case) comes from developers who feel that what took them years to achieve can now be done by anyone, of course with limitations. It’s the same thing that happened when Midjourney launched. A lot of artists were really pissed, but many of my developer friends and coworkers thought, “Wow, this is amazing.

At best, they'd only be useful for the niche people in my community anyway, and I'd share with them if they asked for it. On top of that, there's just no reason to share it because the community has made it pretty clear they are openly hostile to it.\n\nPersonally, I think that's good! If you don't have a problem using coding agents, then use them to build the stuff you need, and we'll all have highly self-tailored stacks, which seems like a cool concept to me, instead of everyone running the exact same setup.\n\nIf the sub doesn't want to deal with \"slop\" then either ban it outright or put together some sort of standard that can be applied to any AI app that checks for the things everyone seems to be concerned about: maintainability, readability, security, etc. Something like a linter that can evaluate a repo and spit out a minimum score to allow for posting.",

There are a gazillion tools, many OSS to check your code quality and security, and many “AI coders” don’t use them at all. \nJust because you have a tool that allows you to build a house it doesn’t mean you don’t have to give it a proper foundation.",

Big Tech was also shit since the 80s. \n\nHowever I will run only a stack that will make sense and I understand. And refactor everything to make it less of a hassle. For some metrics I chose QuestDB a while ago but their community edition doesn't really fit in my infrastructure and I will switch to MariaDB coming spring. Since this is only a hobby and not a job. It still must make sense and not sponsor big tech. Mistakes were made and I will need to fix this.\n\nSince Big Tech is now ruining things everywhere and I run this to maintain my own infrastructure, I really want to depend mostly on real Free(dom) Software not Open Source software with some community edition and masking as a corporate freemium stuff.

There's a lot of inexperience as a result and often projects come with certain mindsets / processes that don't jive as well for OSS community.\n\nI do acknowledge AI assistance can be a powerful tool to compliment development when done right though, and that it shouldn't be frowned upon in that case.\n\nHowever I have also been on the receiving end as a maintainer, receiving bug reports and pull requests that are heavily reliant upon AI tools. Some users don't have the technical aptitude to engage in troubleshooting or discussing technical details of their contribution when I ask questions that they use an LLM to respond (and if you know the quirks and patterns those can have, it can be quite frustrating to engage with).\n\nI've seen massive PRs with a single commit that do a bunch of changes that aren't relevant or make any sense. Sometimes they don't even compile. The very least the contributor could do is disclose AI usage.\n\nSuper annoying to get a bug report when their AI assist of choice fails them that shows the user didn't bother to go over the documentation I spent significant time polishing, or search past issues that match their problem with a solution from me there already. Some even get offended when I complain they didn't disclose usage and that it's disrespectful they've been wasting my time when the problem is caused by their laziness (even if they spent hours with an LLM and are frustrated themselves).\n\nI do agree with you that on the bright side it does empower productivity and the ability to flesh out projects that can have capabilities that is lacking elsewhere. That aspect is pretty cool, and for personal use I think that's fine.\n\n`mise-en-place` is a good example of one such project that's very popular and heavily reliant on LLM-driven development. It's not particularly friendly for the OSS community to engage with IMO though and while it's feature set is desirable, it's also got a variety of questionable practices that makes it difficult to trust or rely on in the long term vs the experience with a handcrafted project (unfortunately those lack the developer bandwidth to progress as quickly, time is also taken in reviews or other aspects related to development for quality that can more easily be dismissed by someone using agents).\n\nFwiw I haven't downvoted you btw.",

      "text": "The recent influx of AI has lowered the barrier to entry to create your own projects. This development in itself is very interesting and we're curious to see how it'll change our world of SelfHosting in the future. \n\nThe negative side of this however is the influx of AI generated posts, vibe-coded projects over a weekend and many others. Normally, the community votes with its voice. But with the high amount of posts flooding in every day, we've noticed a more negative and sometimes even hostile attitude towards these kinds of projects. \n\nThe stance of the SelfHosted moderation team is that the main focus of this sub should be on services that can be selfhosted and their related topics. For example, but not limited to: alternatives to popular services, taking back control over your data and privacy, containerization, networking, security, etc.\n\nIn order to bring back the focus on these main points of SelfHosting, we're introducing \"Vibe code Friday\". This means that anything AI-assisted or vibe-coded in relation to SelfHosting can be posted only on Fridays from here on out. \nThroughout the week, any app or project that falls within the category will be removed. Repeat-offenders will be timed out from posting. \n\nThis is to reduce the flood of these personal projects being posted all the time. And hopefully bring back the focus to more mature projects within the community. \n\nIn order to determine the difference (as going by code & commits alone can be a great indicator but by itself does not make a great case for what constitutes a vibe-coded or AI-assisted project) we've set the following guidelines:\n- Any project younger than a month old\n- With only one real collaborator (known AI persona's do not count, or are an even better indicator)\n- With obvious signs of vibe-coding*\nWill only be allowed on Vibe-code Fridays. \n\nWe'll run this as a trial for at least a month.\n\nSincerely, /r/SelfHosted mod team.",

Any form of concern or criticism is met with \"but everyone uses AI now, get with the times\" and then further devolves into unproductive, repetitive arguments.\n\nYes, we know AI is prevalent in 2026. We just want to know _how_ you used it an honest, documented, open manner. It's really not a difficult question to answer.\n\nI think not only are the projects themselves piles of slop, but it just brings down the whole mood here when a good chunk of posts end up repeating the AI debate over and over. I sincerely hope this new initiative from the mods goes well, I wish you all the best o7 I think this is definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nAlso a sidenote: another thing that irks me is when \"disclosure\" is just one sentence at the top which is a variation of \"I used ___ AI to do a bunch of stuff, but I also used my 30+ year experience in IT and network security to vet the code and make sure it's good 👍🚀\" and then nothing else at all.

Not only is it unethical to take credit for someone else's work, but there are still many people trying to decide how they feel about AI in general, so letting people know about its usage should be a baseline.",

I myself wrote quite a few and stopped maintaining them because of time constraints or other reasons. \n\nAnd this is actually where AI can help, by reducing the time investment needed for many tasks it makes it easier to maintain such projects by solo devs or smaller numbers of collaborators.\n\nThat is, of course, not to support pure vibe coding, I am talking more about AI assisted development.\n\nThe definition and the line here is fuzzy though, because AI assisted is a very broad term and technically we've had ML based autocomplete for years. I understand the focus is on particularly LLM based things, but even here, as adoptions grows, the line between a good project and bad project will depend less and less on whether it was written by with assistance of AI or not.\n\nI think AI should be treated as a tool, not as a definitive determining quality factor of a project. That said, current criteria look fair, but I think everyone should understand that it blanket-covers basically any solo project. \n\nI think more indicators and criteria are needed to find a better line between \"sloppy work\" and \"good project written with assistance of AI\". For example, there were a lot of cool self hosted projects coming from university students. They are made by solo devs with no online track record, but theu are innovative and well written. As ofnright now they would fall under the definition.\n\nBut I am glad that the choice was made to funnel it all into fridays, instead of completely banning it. I think its still fair and in time we'll all be able to refine criteria and rules and everything.",

The argument against is that it makes it REALLY hard for someone trying to share their idea or project to get it across in that small period of time, which leads to gamification (i.e. posting first to get upvotes).\n\nThe argument for individual threads is that it's more like a regular sub experience, but it could certainly lead to a messier situation. Also, just because you limit the submission to Friday doesn't mean the conversation stops there, so it could be a bit hard to monitor. Maybe if you go this route, at least some flair identifying it as either \"AI-Assisted\" or \"Friday Vibe-Coding\" could be useful?\n\nUltimately, just be transparent that it's an experiment, that the community can see how it goes for a while, and adjust based on feedback.\n\n*EDIT*: It also might be nice to have some guidelines for people posting AI-coded projects. For example, best-practices might include being transparent about the AI-assisted nature of the project, making sure to add info to any README about being careful about hosting it outside a private/protected network, if the project is intended to be maintained or more of a one-off, etc. Most of these are reasonable concerns that people have about AI-assisted projects, so just helping people to be clear about their projects and intentions might help everyone out as well.",

Not saying they're AI generated, but more that it would be unpleasant if some of us deployed something AI written and then the person who released it just vanishes when there's issues. There's also the security viewpoint of are they combing over the code the AI generated carefully enough to make sure there's no chances of data breaching or leaking.. \n\nOn the other hand, as an ex-DJ who saw the migration from vinyl records to CDs to digital djing, there was alot of vinyl DJs that looked down at CD DJs, and then alot of CD DJs that looked down at digital DJs and so on. New technology came around, the older crew would die on their hill of the older media and others adapted. I played on all 3 media, it never bothered me, buuuuut it did (as the mods said) lower the entry point for people to start DJing which in turn lowered the value and quality of DJs in the industry.. Those who adapted continued to play but just specialised more on their art, those who didn't adapt continued to play too, just a bit less often so they moved to other roles in the industry (like promoters or marketing or management rolesbat venues).",

Implementing clear labeling would help us distinguish between a polished, long-term build and a 'one-time' project, ensuring users know exactly what’s under the hood and/or it is a well sustainable project. I look forward for what's going to happen with this rules👍",

However, as a developer, I find this decision and the distaste for people using AI to help them develop their projects disappointing. We have to learn how to use these tools to the be able to survive in our industry, and using AI tools in our spare time is the best way to get that practice. I have gone from a bunch of half-baked ideas to being able to create projects that I'd be willing to ship with a bit more time. I don't have the luxury of lots of spare time either, and I would rather finish things that just dream about them. Can absolutely can develop quality code with tools like Claude Code with the right approaches and not \"Build me a clone of X\".\n\nThe \"any project that has existed for less than a month\" is arbitrary, but reasonable. That's enough time for someone putting decent effort into a project to make sure the code isn't half-baked. The other two I can't agree with it. There's a lot of developers who enjoy working alone on projects because its our chance to do something our way. There are plenty of projects that have solo maintainers at the start before they grow a community.\n\nI leave my \"coded with Claude Code\" and Claude contributor enabled for transparency, but it's also been in a number of places, including here, a judgement against people and their projects. Again, as a developer, I find that very discouraging and disappointing. I probably put more thought and work into my code now than I ever have. Now, I just spend more time planning and creating specifications than I do writing code. But getting noses turned up at you in the industry and out in communities is frustrating.\n\nI promise you, what people call \"AI slop\" has existed for far longer than a year or so. Where do you think AIs learned to write code like that? Existing code. There have been open source projects for decades now. Before now, did you go look and people's repositories and review their code before you used it? I'm sure the answer is that there are a number of people who both do and don't. What I used to like about open source software was that it was a way to say \"check out this cool thing I did!\". People would try it out and then make their judgement calls about whether it was good enough. And there's a decent number of free applications with questionably quality code, but people use it because it's free and it works. So where's the line?\n\nI know the intent is to keep the quality of projects shared here high, but what I read between the lines and see in comments is \"if you use AI to help you code your project, it probably sucks\". I can't change people's sentiments, and the rules of this community are certainly out of my control. However, it also feels like inclusive and makes this less of a place I would like to visit.",

I am currently experiencing a critical administrative issue with our official Docker Hub account `bentopdf`\n\nDue to an error during an organization migration, we have temporarily lost control of the `bentopdf` namespace on Docker Hub. **The** `bentopdf` **username/namespace may currently be in a released state, meaning it could potentially be registered by a third party.**  \n  \n**DO NOT** perform a `docker pull bentopdf/...` command at this time.  \n**DO NOT** update your existing containers to `latest`.  \n**If you use BentoPDF in CI/CD pipelines:** Pause your builds or ensure you are using a locally cached version of the image.  \n**If you must deploy:** Please verify that you are using a specific, previously known SHA256 digest that you have already pulled successfully in the past.\n\nI am extremely sorry first of all. While attempting to convert the bentopdf account to an Organization to be verified as a Docker publisher, I renamed the admin to \"alam\"(my name), which I thought would be the new username. I didn't realize that to migrate you need another Docker ID, and this particular docker ID belongs to someone else. We currently do not have access to the \"alam\" account, and the original bentopdf handle is no longer associated with our verified email.\n\nI have already escalated this to Docker Hub Security and Support with \"High Priority\" status to revert the changes and secure the namespace, but they have replied they can't do so. I am in conversation with them to restore our account.\n\nI will update this thread immediately once we have regained control and verified the integrity of the images.\n\nUntil further notice, please consider the Docker Hub `bentopdf` namespace as UNVERIFIED.  \n  \nI am once again very sorry for my negligence and if someone can help me out on this I would be grateful. Thank you.\n\nEDIT: It seems that the new user was last active 5 years ago and hasn't had any activity since. But it's still better to take the necessary precautions \n",

And mine was a personal account. So I read the docs and was converting my personal account to an organizational account during which, I name the new admin username to \"alam\" or so I thought. Turns out this was supposed to be another existing Docker ID, so it was an error on my end. But they didn't ask for any verification so i thought it's just a new username. \n\nNow this particular ID \"alam\" belongs to a third person, which I've no access to and now they have access to our bentopdf Docker image. \n\nNothing suspicious has been done but I believe it's my responsibility to let everyone know until this is resolved and we get back the account.",

      "text": "I've been selfhosting for close to 10 years now. Even longer if you count running a Minecraft server on my PC using Hamachi to share it with friends. I made a lot of mistakes that I want to share to hopefully prevent people from making them as well. Here they are, in no particular order.\n\n# Backups\n\nI had to re-do my whole setup multiple times simply because I was too lazy to do backups. Of course, the 3-2-1 strategy is recommended, but you don't have to do it right from the start. Even storing a copy of the important data on an external hard drive is better than nothing\n\n# Containers or even VMs over bare-metal\n\nThe first server I had was pretty much just an FTP server with a simple php script to do directory listing. For that purpose, running bare metal was more than enough.\n\nThen I started exploring what's possible and wanted to install some actual apps. Nextcloud, Jellyfin, git server, things like that. And boy, was that quickly becoming a nightmare of dependencies, systemd units, and weird \"one off\" commands I had to run every time the server restarted.\n\nEnter Docker. More specifically, Docker Compose. Now I just have a bunch of yaml files that I can push to the server and have Docker take care of running everything, without needing to spend hours on solving missing dependencies and port conflicts\n\n# Infrastructure As Code\n\nBuilding on the previous point, IaC really made managing the server much easier. There are many tools for that, like Ansible or Terraform, but you don't need them.\n\nEven if it's just some `docker-compose.yaml` files and a script that runs `docker compose up -d` over SSH helps immensely. It takes some discipline to not do \"one off\" quickfixes on the server, or at least to sync them up with the IaC.\n\nFor a while I used a Gitlab repo with a pipeline that ran scripts on the server when things changed. That worked surprisingly well, but had the downside of being tied to a specific cloud product. I'm now on Ansible, and TBH I'm only staying with it cause I spent a lot of time setting it up and it's working for me now.\n\n# My OS of choice\n\nOn my desktop, I run Arch btw. It's really good for that use case. It also can be ran on a server, so I gave it a chance. After all, what could go wrong, since I'm only using the OS to run Docker...\n\nZFS. And Wireguard. And constant updates... In short, the updates can cause some things to be just slightly incompatible enough to cause things to break. I've had multiple cases of ZFS kernel module not loading, causing the storage pool to not mount, all the apps failing, and everything dying.\n\nIn short: if you're just running Docker, ZFS and Wireguard, just use Debian, don't be an idiot like me.\n\n# You won't get targeted by hackers; you will get auto-attacked by hundreds of bots every day\n\nHackers are very unlikely to target you specifically. And why would they, there's plenty of better targets for them.\n\nWhat will keep attacking you are the automated bots and port scanners. Nothing unusual, that's just a thing that happens when you're open to the internet.\n\nHowever, you should make sure you're protected. Don't let SSH auth with password, close down ports you don't need, keep everything updated, that sort of things. There are guides about all that, look them up.\n\n# Server at home is nice, but a VPS or a rented root server is just as valid\n\nSo many people here will say that you're not \"actually\" selfhosting if you don't have the server physically in your basement. Fuck every single person who says that.\n\nIt's really fun to own your hardware, it's a one-time investment with upgrades that aren't that expensive. And it also means you can get even a 10Gb/s connection to your server from your computers if you really want.\n\nBut it has several downsides. Noise, power consumption, space, _the price_. Don't let yourself be convinced that those are always worth it, because they're not. I wasted a lot of money on replacement fans cause my server is just too loud.\n\n# 99.999999999% of people won't care\n\nExpect to be the only user of your shit. Maybe with Jellyfin you'd have some people using that, but don't expect to have any users. And if you do - expect to receive complaints whenever things are broken",

No problem, I ssh'ed into my other server (because everyone has more than one, right?), pulled the restic backup of the plex directory, did a \"docker compose up -d\" and a few minutes later my wife was happily watching Plex again.\n\nHaving all my docker compose files backed up along with their local volumes was a huge lifesaver (or wifesaver).

The remote is disaster recovery.\n\nOh, and test those backups regularly. An untested backup is nothing but a hope. \n\nI’ve personally experienced not being able to restore a backup that was on a remote NAS running RAID1.

          "text": "This is great advice. Backups and virtualization really should be the first things everyone should learn when initially getting into self hosting. \n\nI highly recommend anyone starting out to just get started with Proxmox. It’s very well documented, easy to install, and the built in backup service is great for beginners. LXCs let you have lightweight VMs for most anything you want to run with easy snapshots to roll back to if you bork something. ZFS is built in making shared storage across your virtual systems a breeze.\n\nFor slightly more advanced users setting up PBS on mediocre hardware (or even an LXC on your host) lets you create off site backups, or at the very least, a backup separate from your main host. It has deduplication built in and can be paired to any other Proxmox host letting you easily restore backed up LXCs to any host. For real world example of this, I had PBS running on an old celeron NAS and ended up borking my main Proxmox host’s install by doing dumb zfs things. I wiped the install drive, booted to the Proxmox install iso, paired up PBS, and had all of my services up and running within 20 minutes. The main benefit is keeping the host install of Proxmox clean. The only thing I run on it is NUT for my UPS, so after a fresh install of the hypervisor, I reinstall NUT, copy over the configs, and it’s all set. \n\nI’ve only been doing this hobby for a few years now. I started with a pi4 running docker compose for some services. But switching to proxmox has made my life so much easier. WARNING: you may end up making your life more complicated once you realize how much potential Proxmox has though 😉",

The bare‑metals call home via WireGuard and only accept traffic from the whitelisted ipset, which conveniently includes VPN clients coming from my home FRITZ!Box.\n\nMy next step is figuring out how to share the bad\\_guys ipset across all hosts so that if one blocks an IP, the others do too.

          "text": "I had actually tried setting up Koito when you first released it. I had set it up and it was working fine (except the lastfm or maloja imports). The problem that time I faced was that I had been using Maloja + Multiscrobbler + Plex for a very long time. So, I had exported my all time music streaming history from Spotify, Apple Music and Last FM and imported all of that to maloja after lot data preprocessing. So, I did the same with Koito and it didn't process all the imports properly. Same happened with trying to import maloja export.\n\nNow, the tracks which were imported from Spotify, I had no problem importing Spotify history with the number of minutes into Koito. But, for Apple Music I edited the export file to make it look like lastfm import, so it didn't have the minutes information. Same went for last fm import which didn't have any minutes information. So, when these two histories were imported as lastfm import, my import history got completely messed up, where Koito was not fetching anything for the lastfm imports. It was simply showing the artist name and track name in the dashboard (no images and in the logs it kept throwing some error) (I had just tried with a small batch of about 3k songs for the import).\n\nI am planning on trying it out again (this time fresh setup as well), but I had few of questions:\n\n* if I scrobble to Koito directly from say lastfm, how does koito fetch the number of minutes played for each track as lastfm doesn't store that info. Does it fetch the track length from any provider and use it as number of minutes played? If yes, then what happens if Koito is not able to find a particular track in any provider?\n* Also, does Koito by any chance support associations like Maloja does? For example, If I am listening to TWICE and I also separately listen to NAYEON, TZUYU OR MISAMO, Maloja gives me an option to view all these separate artists stats as one under TWICE as an association as they are all members of TWICE.\n* Currently, I moved to Navidrome permanently, so If I setup navidrome with Koito (like you have mentioned in the docs), for a track to be considered as a scrobble, what is the threshold? Does it get scrobbled when 50% of the track is played, or do I need to play the full song for it to get scrobbled to Koito?",

              "text": "Since I first posted about the project I've made improvements to importing, so your imports should hopefully work much better now, especially if you setup the connection with Navidrome before importing so that Koito can just grab the images from Navidrome. Duration information is now fetched and backfilled if Lastfm imports include a MusicBrainz Recording ID as well, so hopefully that will help with some of the problems. One thing that hasn't changed is that Maloja imports still will have no duration information at all, so time played still won't count for any new tracks imported with Maloja.\n\nFor your questions:\n\n- Lastfm doesn't store durations, but does sometimes store MusicBrainz Recording IDs, which Koito will use to get duration info. If an ID isn't provided, Koito will fill in the duration when it receives a listen of the song from Navidrome.\n- I've never used this feature in Maloja, so I don't really know how it works. Koito will just present the artists as they are listed in the track information, so if a song features an artist by name, it will count as a listen for that artist (look at Uncomfortably Numb by American Football ft. Hayley Williams in my public demo to see what I mean).\n- Koito does not determine that threshold at all, it is determined by your music player. For example, I use Feishin with Navidrome, and it has options in the settings to decide when to scrobble the listen back to your music server. I think the default is 4 minutes or 85% of the duration, whichever is sooner.\n\nHope that helps!",

You can even point your music server to Koito, then configure Koito to relay to Maloja so you don't have to give one of them up (I used to do this during Koito's initial development).",

Like, this uses a library \"sass\" that's over a year old and there's just no good reason for that.\n\nAnd then you get bugs they don't know how to fix and the AI can't solve because it doesn't have a strong feedback loop.\n\nAnd finally because it was such a quick spontaneous project the dev gets bored and the project dies in 6 months.\n\nThat's why it's an issue.\n\n--------\n\nIt should be taken in context though.

AI is a tool like anything else, and people have used and abused tools since the dawn of time. It's only now that they refuse to learn a new one that they can get on their useless high horse. Congrats, you're so brave and stunning for not being up to date on your tech.",

Only run in an isolated environment. Do not trust it with data.\n\nIt's highly likely that my vibe coded projects contain known security vulnerabilities, will probably not be efficient, and will likely be fairly garbage under the hood. I am not a developer, so I don't have the ability to check this but also I am not walking around with my eyes firmly closed to reality - a vibed project (right now) is not comparable in quality to human-coded project. Let's be realistic.\n\nIf I wanted to promote it publicly or charge for something then I would want to contract to real humans to review, change or even totally rewrite the project. Which means vibing is just prototyping an MVP/\n\nMy final point is that vibing allows the endless ideas in my head to become a reality. It allows me to improve processes in my life, in ways that suit only me. It's really a personal tool. I could learn to program, but that's a deep rabbit hole - I already have a career in technology and as you might already know this means I am constantly reskilling, upskilling or cross-skilling. It's a really great feeling to be able to turn my dreams into reality, importantly, a reality just for me.\n\nVibing isn't going away, and I can see a future where it integrates with a lot of people's daily lives. A future where static applications are going away, while an AI would be able to dynamically create an application that serves your purpose in that moment, in faster than real-time.

It doesn't strike me right to blame a few individuals who use these tools, nor I think it is a reliable way to improve the status quo.\n\nIn any case, I understand the bad things about AI usage, but my takeaways seem to be a bit different from the ones most people take from this situation: 1- We should absolutely think about the issues and concerns people raise about large scale usage of ML models, and keep them in mind as we develop the technology not only to improve it, but to mitigate it's problems (be them ethical or technical): and 2- We should not blame individual usage of technologies, and instead focus on the bigger aggressors, by promoting structural changes that try to fix the fundamental problems with our technology stack (e.g.: promoting clean energy, like nuclear or wind; mitigate ineffective usage of these technologies by big players; improve the conditions of living of those working on the entire line of production of the hardware we use).",

Maybe if it were written using more \"I\" statements and less projection I might have found it more interesting. \n\nFrom the article:\n\n> The code often works fine. Sometimes it’s even better than what a solo developer would write manually.\n\nFrom my own person experience, I have not found this to be true for purely vibe-coded software. \n\nSome weeks ago, someone posted a \"production ready encrypted\" notes app, that was in fact *not* encrypting notes.  That's very problematic, and I think this subreddit has done a great job filtering out those horrible applications.\n\n> That assumption held because building software was hard.\n> The difficulty was a filter.\n\nI disagree with this premise. From my view, if the generally held assumption was that building software was hard, the open-source community would *not* have been as vibrant as it was before LLMs became generally available, software development was becoming very approachable and easier to learn.\n\nThe filter for me, was whether the software at least did the thing it was said to do, and the developer was open to fixing issues. The article equates this to \"time\", but its more than that, especially with this subreddit. There are  relationships built with those that build and distribute software (vibe-coded or not). If people have a bad relationship with the developer, vibe-coded or not, no one would use their software.\n\n> More importantly, everyone can code above their skill level. \n\nMany people did that WAY before LLMs came around. Copying and pasting code found on different forums, and StackOverFlow. \n\nDeep domain knowledge is **always** a continual problem in any field as technology evolves. I remember in the early 2000s people complaining that Python was giving people the ability to develop apps faster, but without an understanding of the science behind computing.

You then ask a question like \"write me a python function to transpose a matrix\". An LLM will then analyse the question, find python code someone wrote (a GH repo, a blog about transposing matrices, etc.) and regurgitate that code to you, maybe altering it a bit (e.g. to put in your variable names).\n\nIf the coding subject is a common one, an LLM will give you very good results: we've had people code MVP chess/checkers/memory games in a couple of hours - but there is plenty of code out there implementing those things for an LLM to draw from. If you tackle more complex problems, or problems with subtly different requirements than what's available online, an LLM will struggle, and you along with it (I've been there).\n\nThere's another aspect to consider here: as a geek developer, I am *more expressive* writing code than writing natural language. If I have a conceptual solution to a problem, I'll generally need less time to convert that into code than to write out the solution in natural language, guiding an LLM in \"coding\".\n\nLLMs currently don't even understand context around texts they parse - I've had Claude and Gemini suggest \"solutions\" that were actually feature request discussions around possible additions/changes to tools/languages.\n\nLLMs are trained to parse natural language queries and return grammatically correct replies. That's it. Factual correctness is a side-effect of training materials and their correctness. As a trivial example, if you trained an LLM on texts that said the Sun is green, that LLM would give a grammatically perfectly correct reply to your query about the colour of the Sun, and it would be something like \"The Sun is green.\"",

They are only as bad/god as the Dev who prompted and reviewed them. AI does mistakes, but so do humans. An AI can help you to increase the security, when you ask it to. Same as China can produce high end products if you ask and pay for them. \n\nSo when I come across an app, I first check **who has published it**. Is it a first grade student or someone with a Github history and repositories dating back to 2009. Still no guarantee it has no flaws. So reviewing them is the same effort as on human coded projects.\n\nBut I see a much bigger issue with vibe coded projects: It is the maintenance. I call it the Tinder effect. If someone used 5 prompts to build it, he might be not so attached to the project and abandon it early for the next vibe coded project. So you should probably not build your entire business around it. But there are so many \"nice to have\" projects.\n\nAn absolute NoGo for me are closed source vibe apps.

Unlike traditional AI-assisted coding or pair programming, the human developer avoids examination of the code, accepts AI-suggested completions without human review, and focuses more on iterative experimentation than on code correctness or structure.\n\nVibe coding is inherently not great.

          "text": "I'm kinda tired of the binary \"vibe-coded vs not vibe-coded\" labeling, and I agree with what a few other comments here already pointed out: we should separate \"vibe-coding\" from just LLM-assisted coding. In my head, \"vibe-coded\" specifically means \"someone with little/no programming context is delegating basically everything to an LLM and shipping whatever comes out.\" That's different from LLM-assisted coding. And there's clearly a spectrum: you can vibe-code a throwaway script, or use an LLM as a fancy autocomplete + rubber duck while still doing real engineering.\n\nWhat actually matters (regardless of the label) is the *code quality*: the right patterns/strategies are used (and not cargo-culted), the code is maintainable/readable, it's actually extensible without turning into spaghetti, etc. Humans ship catastrophic slop here all the time too. \"Written by a human\" isn't a quality guarantee any more than \"made in China\" is.\n\nFrom here on this is kind of a tangent, and it got way longer than I intended. So feel free to skip it. But I already wrote it, so I'm dropping it here anyway.\n\nComing from an ML research and as a systems engineer background, I was already using LLMs in my workflow before ChatGPT blew up, so I've seen both where they're genuinely powerful and where they confidently drive straight off a cliff. Used correctly, LLMs are incredibly useful *tools* (including for coding) and can sometimes save you time, but the annoying part is you don't get to skip the fundamentals: you still need programming knowledge *and* a feel for how LLMs behave to constrain them and validate outputs.\n\nIn those cases you can vibe-code and it's usually a reasonable tradeoff: one-off scripts, personal small-scale apps, \"I need a tiny app to solve this niche problem and I don't care about long-term maintenance.\" LLMs are good at getting you to \"good enough\" fast there. And yeah, it can still fail, but the nice thing is the blast radius is small - if it goes sideways you can just throw it away and restart from scratch in 10 minutes.\n\nWhere people get burned is bigger systems. Once you're building something that needs to grow over time, the hard part isn't typing code - it's the design part: architecture, boundaries, interfaces, dependencies, etc. Current (and perhaps even future) LLMs are very good at producing something that looks plausible, but they don't reliably \"think\" their way through open-ended design spaces. They work best when the answer space is narrow / well-established. When there are tons of valid options and tradeoffs depend on context, so if you just ask \"design this whole app using best practices\" you're basically forcing the model to pick from a huge space of possibilities without enough constraints. It'll still give you *something*, but unless you already have the context to judge it, you won't know if it's appropriate - because it didn't \"think through\" the tradeoffs and pick a design so much as *sample one* from a huge space of plausible options (more like rolling dice).\n\nIn bigger projects, I've found LLMs can be genuinely useful if you stop treating them like \"the engineer\" and instead use them more like an implementation engine. That means you (a human) do the architecture and decision-making up front: split the system into well-isolated components with clear responsibilities and stable interfaces, keep modules independent and understandable without needing the whole repo in your head (and in the model context (!)), and make everything explicit and boring rather than clever. Verbosity isn't a drawback here - LLMs will type for you. Once the boundaries are real, you can hand the model a narrowly scoped task without having LLMs fail and ruin the entire repo, and without having to include the large context of an entire repo. And once your modules are actually separated, you can add tests. Tests are the thing that turns LLM output from \"a vibe\" into something measurable. With good tests, the model cannot be ambiguous about correctness. It either passes or it doesn't. Same with documentation. All the design decisions, policies, etc. should be written down. Not just for humans, but because that becomes the context you want to feed an LLM. Strong specs + tests massively narrow the problem space, and that's where LLMs tend to perform best: filling in deterministic implementation details inside a clearly defined box. At that point it should be obvious that \"context\" shouldn't mean \"here's my entire repo, now act like a senior dev.\" It should mean \"here's the spec, here are policies, here are the tests ...\" Because LLMs can stare at your codebase all day and still not reliably infer the *system's intent* from it.\n\nAlso, none of this is some brand new AI-native idea - it's basically classic systems/software engineering. Getting value out of them at scale still requires real engineering skill. And the \"narrow the option space\" prompt-writing is hard without domain/context knowledge. This applies outside programming too.\n\nAnyway, you can do good development while using LLMs, and you can also do terrible development without them. That's why I don't like labeling anything that touches an LLM as automatically \"vibe-coded.\" That said, building a good large-scale application *purely* by vibe-coding is not possible with current LLMs (and probably won't be for a long time). And honestly, most \"LLM-driven\" projects I see today are slop.\n\n(Also yes, this comment is LLM-assisted lol, my English isn't native)",

It would consistently start over clocking one thread processor and cause my computer to over heat and shut down... which then shut down.... and then I had no dns and a very angry wife.\n\nLong story short. I ran some optimization for the over clocking, tried multiple different configs and windows still was acting weird. Shortly after I thought I had the issue resolved, windows  decided it need to ping everything all the time all at once and started sending a dns request every half second or more... and then caused the threads assigned to the pi-hole to overheat and the machine to crash. \n\nI ended up setting up a raspberry pi and a old laptop both with pihole and a docker container to sync them so my wife could have some peace. The raspberry pi is phenomenal. Super stable, very low power draw. \n\n.... she still side eyes me every time google thinks to long.",

I also looked FolderHost, and it was using only 18 MB of RAM xd. I know that jellyfin is not the right app to compare it with because it's not doing the same thing.

      "text": "While working on my own KVM setup, it slowly dawned on me how awkward it is that we still treat BIOS as video. Most firmware screens are clearly text-based, yet we compress and push pixels around just to change a boot option or read an error message. The more I worked on it, the more that approach started to feel fundamentally wrong.\n\nIn an ideal world, everything would have a proper BMC. In practice, a lot of homelab gear - especially small servers, NUCs, and various Chinese or whitebox boards - simply doesn’t. And even when BMC is available, it’s not always something I want to depend on for last-resort recovery.\n\nSo I ended up building a small, dedicated hardware device for headless maintenance that I now keep in the rack as a “break glass” tool.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fz7s735g8rdg1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f7f8950b28cc29811c8aaa554eac9c58b8a6a8d\n\nThe first part is BIOS-to-Text. The device sits inline on HDMI and, instead of treating the signal as a video stream, it reconstructs what’s on the firmware screen and exposes it as an ANSI text interface over SSH. It’s intentionally focused on firmware and pre-OS environments rather than general-purpose graphics. From a terminal, I can navigate BIOS menus, read POST output, copy error messages, or script pre-OS workflows without dealing with video latency or blind keystrokes.\n\n[The output isn’t a framebuffer. It’s a pure ANSI text stream served over SSH](https://preview.redd.it/zid7f1oj8rdg1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bb5f62b6a06c28cdea735054d8782b262954ccf)\n\nThe second part is recovery. I integrated a local storage layer based on Btrfs that presents itself to the host as a normal USB drive, but internally keeps immutable, read-only snapshots. This is not meant for snapshotting an OS or doing live rollbacks. I use it purely as a resilient container for ISOs, rescue environments, and recovery scripts. Even if the host is compromised or wipes the drive, previous snapshots remain intact and readable, so recovery media doesn’t disappear when you need it most.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wec75zv3crdg1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d90c811d8b5c7b39c177ff05331f44158759c25\n\nThe goal wasn’t to replace existing KVMs or BMCs, but to have a reliable last-resort device that works without agents on the host, without relying on the OS, and without assuming the network or firmware stack is in a healthy state. It’s the thing I reach for when everything else has already failed and I just want my weekend back.\n\nI’ve been documenting the build and experiments as a personal devlog over at r/USBridge if anyone is curious about the internals.",

To be clear: this isn’t trying to turn fully animated GUIs into a terminal movie.

For those (and simpler graphical UEFIs), it works reasonably well.

      "text": "Hello, I'm sure many of you are familiar with **calibre-web-automated-book-downloader**. The name was indeed a mouthful and a little confusing with the mention of calibre-web-automated. This has now been renamed to **Shelfmark** with this latest update :)\n\nStill all the same CWABD features as before, the simple web download tool. In fact, if you don't touch the settings I guarantee you couldn't tell the difference. All new features are optional and configurable, the direct download mode remains the same out-of-the-box experience.\n\nFor more info and the docker compose file, [visit the repo](https://github.com/calibrain/shelfmark).\n\n# What’s new?\n\n* **Torrent, Usenet and IRC download support** \\- Alongside existing web book search, you can now connect your Prowlarr instance to search torrent and usenet downloads, including MAM. Works with qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge, SABnzbd, and NZBGet. Or configure IRC to search ebook channels and use the built-in XDCC downloader.\n* **Audiobook support** \\- Dedicated search and processing for Audiobook downloads. Search and download from popular sources like MAM and deposit directly Audiobookshelf and similar tools\n* **File handling** \\- Template-based renaming (similar to Readarr), custom directory creation and hardlinking for torrents. (E.g. Great for Audiobookshelf). And still works great for moving into an ingest folder for Calibre/CWA/Booklore etc.\n* **Direct download** \\- Rebuilt cloudflare bypasser, hugely optimised download speed and reliability, and full mirror customisation to avoid slow / blocked URLs.\n* **Search improvements** \\- Hardcover search integration now pulls richer metadata, cover art, and series info - great for the search experience and great for custom directory creation.\n\n# Overall experience\n\nThink of Shelfmark like your personal search engine for books. Search and browse book files from multiple sources in the same UI - all with unified preferences, downloads and file processing. Pairs well with any library tool (Calibre, CWA, or Booklore's ingest folders, or Audiobookshelf's file directory setup), and works great for end-users to search and grab books themselves too.\n\n[Home screen](https://preview.redd.it/wz6o5r9niycg1.png?width=3014&format=png&auto=webp&s=847dd6a5e39cc42232144ed2d7c31a9f7f2037e4)\n\n[Search results from API provider of your choice](https://preview.redd.it/6s40akfoiycg1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=207494a40798ba949ef4e1e731e7761412197e1c)\n\n[Access downloads from multiple sources](https://preview.redd.it/t8x2n7aqiycg1.png?width=3012&format=png&auto=webp&s=176758646b562ef5881ccd7d491ee1f684ca329b)\n\n\\---\n\n**Other great features from recent updates:**\n\n* **Full AA support -** the original purpose of the app, now revamped and optimised in a million different ways over the last month. For anyone returning to trying this app, I hope you find the AA downloads to be much faster and more reliable overall.\n* Very overdue - a full **settings UI and config system.** Much easier to adjust and discover all the tools available to get the app working how you like.\n* **Brand new UI** \\- Recently added in December, revamped UI in the style of a search engine. Simple and easy to use, and great for other users e.g. friends and family.\n* **Multi-language support,** when paired with Hardcover is very effective for finding localised / translated books on AA automatically.\n* **RAR / ZIP support -** automatically extracts and uses book / audiobook files.\n\n**Existing CWABD user?**\n\nNo need to change a thing. Installs will continue to get updated, no setup or migration required. All new features are optional in the settings UI.\n\nWould love you to give it a try! Thanks :)\n\n[ https://github.com/calibrain/shelfmark ](https://github.com/calibrain/shelfmark)",

I figured it out through trial and error, but would probably update the compose.yaml to better explain what the 'downloads' and 'books' folders are meant to do.\n* I can't seem to turn off AA, but it looks as if that's not being dumb, just something that's not yet possible. I'd prefer to use other sources (Prowlarr provided), but see bullet #1 above. :-D \n\nAnywho, great app. Well done mate.

      "text": "I went down a bit of a rabbit hole recently trying to justify self-hosting AI for myself and ended up doing some fairly strict dollar for dollar math. Thought this might be useful for others here, even if the conclusion is a bit uncomfortable for a selfhost crowd.\n\nSetup assumptions on my side:\n\n\t•\tAI usage around 4–6 hours a day, mostly interactive\n\n\t•\tStorage needs around 2 TB, but must be accessible 24/7 from anywhere\n\n\t•\tElectricity included properly (idle power + active usage)\n\n\t•\tCost of capital assumed at 17 percent\n\n\t•\tDepreciation over 3 years\n\n\t•\tDisposal value included (GPUs keep value surprisingly wel, if you assume that it will be an upmarket)\n\n\t•\tNo heroic assumptions about free time or zero maintenance\n\nAfter modelling a few common GPU setups and comparing against Google AI Pro, this is what I ended up with on a monthly economic cost basis:\n\nOption\n\nMonthly Cost\n\nGoogle AI Pro\n\n$19.99\n\nRTX 3060\n\n\\~$49\n\nRTX 3090\n\n\\~$67\n\nRTX 4070 Ti Super\n\n\\~$63\n\nRTX A5000 (used)\n\n\\~$69\n\nThis includes hardwar amortization, cost of capital, power (including 24/7 storage uptime), and realistic resale value at the end.\n\nWhat surprised me most is not that self-hosting costs more, but how much Google seems to be eating the cost here. AI Pro is basically giving:\n\n\t•\tFrontier-ish models\n\n\t•\tVery low latency\n\n\t•\tNo maintenance\n\n\t•\t2 TB storage\n\n\t•\tGlobal availability\n\n\t•\tReasonable usage limits (at least for now)\n\nAt $20/month this feels heavily subsidised. Which then brings up the obvious enshittification question. This feels like a classic playbook where pricing is below long-run cost to lock in usage and expectations, and then things tighten later.\n\nFrom a pure selfhost perspective, I still see value if you care about:\n\n\t•\tPrivacy\n\n\t•\tUnlimited usage\n\n\t•\tCustom fine-tuning\n\n\t•\tOffline access\n\nBut for me personally, right now, with my usage level, self-hosting AI does not make economic sense. Even the most efficient GPU setups are roughly 3x the cost of AI Pro once you treat capital properly.\n\nSo for now I’m probably sticking with Google AI Pro and keeping local self-hosting for other services where the economics are clearer. Curious if others have run similar numbers or if I’m missing something obvious here.\n\nWould love to hear counterexamples or cases where this does flip in favour of self-hosting without assuming massive daily usage. Obviously, I know Google has enterprise hardware like their own custom asics or the H200s and economies of scale and stuff... but what obvious points am i missing or it's not just a game not worth doing (from a pure monetary pov) unless you really need it for doing AI related developments and stuff?",

Yes, there's probably some subsidizing going on, but you're one person using it interactively. At scale, they get enough queries that they run it constantly.\n\n\nThe Pro plan is $20 for 100 queries per day. They can run a lot of Pro-level users on one server over the course of the day, so that adds up.\n\n\nBut the deal is even better for them, because of a technical detail: multiple simultaneous queries are basically free. Due to the way GPUs work, they typically have the bandwidth to calculate a bundle of queries all at once, since it's just more multiplication and doing the calculations across one neural network layer simultaneously is ridiculously more efficient than doing it in the layers in sequence. So the efficiency comparison of your individual queries is wasting 20x or more processing power. You can do something similar if you use something like VLLM on your own GPU...but of course, that requires that you actually have that many simultaneous queries. \n\n\nThe real money is in things like coding and agents and batch processing; those subscriptions run you $200+ per month (and still have rate limits) or are billed per-token. You can check Openrouter for a good cross-section of API per-token prices.\n\n\nIf you're just using it interactively as a single user, and the $20 plan works for you, then it's obviously a good deal. If you're automating agents, with many queries every time it does something, the API costs can add up fast.",

That being said, these numbers are going to be significantly off, because the models they are running are actually much more expensive to run. GPT 5.2 won't run on any of these cards, I'd be surprised if the frontier models will even run on a single H100, so we're talking $500k servers to run a model effectively. But I'd think they are slightly profitable on inference, because that server can do inference for hundreds of people. I don't know their numbers but the number of active users/ inference servers is probably significantly higher than you think it is.\n\nWhere they are ABSOLUTELY subsidizing is training, The vast majority of the hardware that these companies are buying is running at 100% load constantly, the best estimates that I've seen are that it's a fairly even split between data ingest, training and inference. So the part that you pay for (and can do yourself) makes up about 1/3 of their hardware costs, it's clear that subscriptions are not covering the entire bill but if the numbers are correct of \\~9B in expenses and 4B in revenue big AI companies aren't really subsidizing inference, but they are heavily subsidizing the models.",

Sell your product cheap to gain users, offset some of the costs by selling user data, slowly increase prices.\n\nIts the same thing with hosting your own media server. You'll need to spend $200-300 on HDDs (for fairly low capacity server with backup disk), ~$150 for a n100 mini PC or a little cheaper with a used computer. At that point youre at ~2 years of monthly netflix payments if there's no price increases.

Don’t block countries, instead block everything by default and allow the country or countries you need access from.\n- Disable password login\n- Never expose administration interfaces to the internet. That includes any web admin tools. One of the things i dislike most about Synology is that everything runs on port 5001, including DSM access, meaning you can’t expose it directly without exposing DSM as well. With QuickConnect you can allow services like drive and photos, and prohibit access to DSM, so use that instead of exposing it directly.\n- Setup something that blocks access from well known bots / malicious IPs.

I run web servers, and yes, of course sometimes bots do annoying sh\\*t.  Last round some months or so back, for years I've been running services where one can check one's source IP as seen by The Internet, via http, https, or ssh.  Well, some sh\\*t folk(s) decided to deploy that to their botnet to check their IPs, so I was getting hit continually with 10 requests  per second.  And IP addresses quite scattered all over too ... but they'd eventually repeat too - at least for the most part.  Yeah, bit more config on fail2ban, and one such request from such bots, and they're then blocked for quite a while - that knocked the volume down by well over an order of magnitude.  And way more efficient than doing it within Apache - as putting it there really didn't cut the load and resource consumption enough by itself.\n\nThere are lots of various things one can do, but if one very intentionally runs public servers/services, well, fail2ban does come in quite handy for majorly knocking down the worst offenders.  Certainly not the only possible approach, but a quite to highly useful tools for many things.  And of course with ssh, having it well hardened may not make the bot annoyance go away, but well keeps 'em from getting in.  Yeah, decades of ssh open to The Internet, so far nothing has passed ssh authentication that wasn't supposed to.  Mostly they just guess common logins and passwords, but I suppose if they get more specific info somewhere they could always do a more targeted attack, but thus far they've never made it in - and that's stretching well over multiple decades now.",

The (VM) host doesn't have tons of resources, so even some aggressive impolite web crawlers cause issues.  First of that I bumped into well over a decade ago - system was \"mysteriously\" crashing (or hard hanging?) semi-regularly.  Eventually found cause - nasty crawler would hammer away with numerous simultaneous connections going full tilt on it, that would exhaust system resources to the point where the host was effectively dead (or crashed).  First step may have been a watchdog, so at least it wouldn't remain stuck/wedged.  Issue happened fast enough when it occurred, didn't easily catch exactly what was happening, but eventually found it.  And the fix for that was also easy enough - in that case I just tuned Apache so it couldn't exhaust the host's resources - that was \"good enough\" for that case.\n\nHave had other bots that grind away registering hundreds to thousands or more accounts on, e.g. wiki, WordPress, etc.  Eventually just do the needed counter-measures to cut that sh\\*t off from the bots.  And alas, there's typically the needed cleanup after that to get rid of the bot accounts.  So far most of 'em are too stupid to even figure out what to do with the accounts after they create 'em - almost never had 'em spam content or lists yet, but alas, that day will probably come ... but mostly the bots are pretty damn stupid ... but alas, make up for it in volume ... ugh.  Heck, even a list where I'm listadmin but have no real control on measures to stop bots, the bots are still pretty stupid and generally only manage to sneak through a few post or so per year - most are stopped before that, or are too stupid to make it that far.  Heck, wish Reddit was that \"smart\" ... way too damn much AI content makes it through ... might not be so bad if it was all flagged as AI and one could opt out of seeing any and all such AI content but ... ugh, yeah, that ... and many other (heck most) \"social media\" platforms.",

This isn't theory - it's battle-tested knowledge that kept our services running through countless deployments.\n\n**What's in V1:**\n- Complete Swarm hierarchy explained\n- VPS requirements and cost planning across providers\n- DNS configuration (the #1 cause of Swarm issues)\n- Production-ready compose files and multi-stage Dockerfiles\n- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack\n- Platform comparison (Portainer, Dokploy, Coolify, CapRover, Dockge)\n- CI/CD versioning and deployment workflows\n- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TheDecipherist/docker-swarm-guide) with all configs\n\n---\n\n## Why Docker Swarm in 2026?\n\nBefore the Kubernetes crowd jumps in - yes, I know K8s exists. But here's the thing: **Docker Swarm is still incredibly relevant in 2026**, especially for small-to-medium teams who want container orchestration without the complexity overhead.\n\nSwarm advantages:\n- Native Docker integration (no YAML hell beyond compose files)\n- Significantly lower learning curve\n- Perfect for 2-20 node clusters\n- Built-in service discovery and load balancing\n- Rolling updates out of the box\n- Works with your existing Docker Compose files (mostly)\n\nIf you're not running thousands of microservices across multiple data centers, Swarm might be exactly what you need.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding the Docker Swarm Hierarchy\n\n```\nSwarm → Nodes → Stacks → Services → Tasks (Containers)\n```\n\n- **Swarm**: Your entire cluster. Only works with **pre-built images** - no `docker build` in production.\n- **Nodes**: Managers (handle state/scheduling) and Workers (run containers). Use 3 or 5 managers for HA.\n- **Stacks**: Groups of related services from a compose file.\n- **Services**: Manage replicas, rolling updates, health monitoring, auto-restart.\n- **Tasks**: A Task = Container. 6 replicas = 6 tasks.\n\n---\n\n## VPS Requirements & Cost Planning\n\nDocker Swarm is lightweight - minimal overhead compared to Kubernetes.\n\n### Infrastructure Presets\n\n| Preset | Nodes | Layout | Min Specs (per node) | Use Case |\n|--------|-------|--------|---------------------|----------|\n| **Minimal** | 1 | 1 manager | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 25GB | Dev/testing only |\n| **Basic** | 2 | 1 manager + 1 worker | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 50GB | Small production |\n| **Standard** | 3 | 1 manager + 2 workers | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB | Standard production |\n| **HA** | 5 | 3 managers + 2 workers | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB | High availability |\n\n### Approximate Monthly Costs (2025/2026)\n\n| Provider | Basic (2 nodes) | Standard (3 nodes) | HA (5 nodes) |\n|----------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| **Hetzner** | ~€8-12 | ~€20-30 | ~€40-60 |\n| **Vultr** | ~$12-20 | ~$30-50 | ~$60-100 |\n| **DigitalOcean** | ~$16-24 | ~$40-60 | ~$80-120 |\n| **Linode** | ~$14-22 | ~$35-55 | ~$70-110 |\n\n**Why these numbers?**\n- **1GB RAM minimum**: Swarm itself uses ~100-200MB, but you need headroom for containers\n- **3 or 5 managers for HA**: Raft consensus requires odd numbers for quorum\n- **2 vCPU for production**: Single core gets bottlenecked during deployments\n\n### My Recommendation\n\nFor most small-to-medium teams:\n1. **Start with Basic (2 nodes)** - 1 manager + 1 worker on Vultr or Hetzner\n2. **Budget ~$20-40/month** for a production-ready setup\n3. **Add nodes as needed** - Swarm makes scaling easy\n\nIf you need HA from day one, the **Standard (3 nodes)** preset gives you redundancy without breaking the bank.\n\n### What About AWS/GCP/Azure?\n\nCloud giants work fine with Swarm, but:\n- **More expensive** for equivalent specs\n- **More complexity** (VPCs, security groups, IAM)\n- **Better if** you need other AWS services (RDS, S3, etc.)\n\nWe run Swarm on AWS EC2 because we're already deep in the AWS ecosystem. If you're starting fresh, a dedicated VPS provider is simpler and cheaper.\n\n---\n\n## Setting Up Your Production Environment\n\n### Install Docker (Ubuntu)\n\n```bash\n# Add Docker's official GPG key and repo\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg\nsudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg\n\necho \"deb [arch=\"$(dpkg --print-architecture)\" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo \"$VERSION_CODENAME\") stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n```\n\n**Important:** Use `docker compose` (space), not `docker-compose` (deprecated).\n\n### Initialize the Swarm\n\n```bash\n# Get your internal IP\nip addr\n\n# Initialize on manager (use YOUR internal IP)\ndocker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.10.1.141:2377 --listen-addr 10.10.1.141:2377\n\n# Join token for workers (save this!)\ndocker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-xxxxx... 10.10.1.141:2377\n```\n\n**Critical:** Use a fixed IP for advertise address. Dynamic IPs will break your cluster on restart.\n\n---\n\n## DNS Configuration (This Will Save You Hours)\n\n**CRITICAL**: DNS issues cause 90% of Swarm networking problems.\n\nEdit `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` on each node:\n\n```ini\n[Resolve]\nDNS=10.10.1.122 8.8.8.8\nDomains=~yourdomain.io\n```\n\nThen reboot. Docker runs its own DNS at `127.0.0.11` for container-to-container resolution.\n\n**Rule:** Never hardcode IPs in Swarm. Use service names - Docker handles routing.\n\n---\n\n## Network Configuration\n\nCreate an overlay network (mandatory for multi-node):\n\n```bash\ndocker network create \\\n  --opt encrypted \\\n  --subnet 172.240.0.0/24 \\\n  --gateway 172.240.0.254 \\\n  --attachable \\\n  --driver overlay \\\n  awsnet\n```\n\n| Flag | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `--opt encrypted` | IPsec encryption. Optional but recommended. **Note:** Can cause issues with NAT - use internal VPC IPs |\n| `--subnet` | Prevents conflicts with VPC ranges |\n| `--attachable` | Allows standalone containers to connect |\n\n### Required Ports\n\n- **TCP 2377**: Cluster management\n- **TCP/UDP 7946**: Node communication\n- **TCP/UDP 4789**: Overlay network traffic\n\n---\n\n## Production Compose File\n\n```yaml\nversion: \"3.8\"\n\nservices:\n  nodeserver:\n    dns:\n      - 10.10.1.122\n    init: true  # Proper signal handling, zombie cleanup\n\n    environment:\n      - NODE_ENV=production\n      - API_KEY=${API_KEY}\n\n    deploy:\n      mode: replicated\n      replicas: 6\n      placement:\n        max_replicas_per_node: 3\n      update_config:\n        parallelism: 2\n        delay: 10s\n        failure_action: rollback\n        order: start-first\n      rollback_config:\n        parallelism: 2\n        delay: 10s\n      restart_policy:\n        condition: on-failure\n        delay: 5s\n        max_attempts: 3\n        window: 120s\n      resources:\n        limits:\n          cpus: '0.50'\n          memory: 400M\n        reservations:\n          cpus: '0.20'\n          memory: 150M\n\n    image: \"yourregistry/nodeserver:latest\"\n    ports:\n      - \"61339\"\n    networks:\n      awsnet:\n    secrets:\n      - app_secrets\n\nsecrets:\n  app_secrets:\n    external: true\n\nnetworks:\n  awsnet:\n    external: true\n```\n\n**Key settings:**\n- `init: true` - Runs tini as PID 1 for proper signal handling\n- `failure_action: rollback` - Auto-rollback on failed deployments\n- `order: start-first` - New containers start before old ones stop (zero downtime)\n- **Always set resource limits** - A runaway container can kill your node\n\n---\n\n## Dockerfile Best Practices\n\n### Multi-Stage Build (Node.js)\n\n```dockerfile\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\nFROM node:20-bookworm-slim AS base\nWORKDIR /app\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3 make g++ && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nCOPY package.json package-lock.json ./\n\nFROM base AS compiled\nRUN npm ci --omit=dev\n\nFROM node:20-bookworm-slim AS final\nRUN ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --from=compiled /app/node_modules /app/node_modules\nCOPY . .\nEXPOSE 3000\nENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"./server.js\"]\n```\n\n**Why multi-stage?** Build tools stay in temp stage. Final image is clean and small.\n\n### Key Rules\n\n1. **Run in foreground** - `CMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]` (official nginx image handles this)\n2. **Pin base images** - `FROM ubuntu:22.04` not `FROM ubuntu:latest`\n3. **Include health checks** - Swarm uses these for rolling updates\n4. **Use .dockerignore** - Exclude `.env`, `node_modules`, `.git`\n\n### Sample .dockerignore\n\n```\n.git\n.gitignore\n.env\n.env.*\nnode_modules\nnpm-debug.log\nDockerfile*\ndocker-compose*\n.dockerignore\n*.md\n.vscode\n.idea\n```\n\nThis keeps your build context small and prevents secrets from accidentally ending up in images.\n\n---\n\n## Monitoring Stack (Prometheus + Grafana)\n\nFull compose file in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TheDecipherist/docker-swarm-guide). Key points:\n\n| Service | Purpose | Mode |\n|---------|---------|------|\n| Grafana | Dashboards | 1 replica on manager |\n| Prometheus | Metrics collection | 1 replica on manager |\n| cAdvisor | Container metrics | Global (all nodes) |\n| Node Exporter | Host metrics | Global (all nodes) |\n\nUse `mode: global` for monitoring agents - runs ONE instance on EVERY node.\n\n**Quick setup tip:** Start with cAdvisor + Node Exporter first. Add Prometheus when you need historical data. Add Grafana when you need pretty dashboards for your team.\n\n---\n\n## Docker Management Platforms\n\nManaging Swarm via CLI is powerful, but GUIs improve visibility significantly.\n\n### Portainer\n\n**Best for:** Teams wanting visual management without changing workflows.\n\n```bash\n# Deploy Portainer agent on each node\ndocker service create --name portainer_agent \\\n  --publish mode=host,target=9001,published=9001 \\\n  --mode global \\\n  --mount type=bind,src=//var/run/docker.sock,dst=/var/run/docker.sock \\\n  --mount type=bind,src=//var/lib/docker/volumes,dst=/var/lib/docker/volumes \\\n  portainer/agent:latest\n\n# Deploy Portainer server on manager\ndocker service create --name portainer \\\n  --publish 9443:9443 --publish 8000:8000 \\\n  --replicas=1 --constraint 'node.role == manager' \\\n  --mount type=volume,src=portainer_data,dst=/data \\\n  portainer/portainer-ce:latest\n```\n\n**Pricing:** CE is completely free with no node limits. Business Edition adds enterprise features.\n\n**Why Portainer?** It shows you container logs, resource usage, network topology, and lets you manage stacks visually. Perfect for teams where not everyone is a CLI wizard.\n\n### Platform Comparison\n\n| Platform | Swarm Support | Git Deploy | Auto SSL | Best For |\n|----------|---------------|------------|----------|----------|\n| **Portainer** | Full | No | No | Visual management |\n| **Dokploy** | Full | Yes | Yes | Heroku-style on Swarm |\n| **Coolify** | Experimental | Yes | Yes | 280+ templates, great UI |\n| **CapRover** | Full (native) | Yes | Yes | Proven Swarm PaaS |\n| **Dockge** | None | No | No | Simple Compose management |\n\n**My setup:** Portainer for visibility + custom CI/CD + Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.\n\n**Note on Coolify:** Their Swarm support is experimental. Works for basic setups but I've hit edge cases. Great project though - watch this space.\n\n---\n\n## Secret Management\n\n**Stop using environment variables for secrets.**\n\n```yaml\nsecrets:\n  app_secrets:\n    external: true  # Created via CLI or Portainer\n\nservices:\n  app:\n    secrets:\n      - app_secrets\n```\n\nCreate secrets:\n```bash\ndocker secret create app_secrets ./secrets.json\n```\n\nSecrets appear as files in `/run/secrets/SECRET_NAME`. They're encrypted at rest, not visible in `docker inspect`, and only sent to nodes that need them.\n\n---\n\n## CI/CD Versioning\n\n```bash\nBUILD_VERSION=$(cat ./buildVersion.txt)\nLONG_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)\n\ndocker compose build --build-arg GIT_COMMIT=$LONG_COMMIT --build-arg BUILD_VERSION=$BUILD_VERSION\ndocker compose push\ndocker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack\n```\n\n**Never use `latest` in production.** Use commit hashes or semantic versions.\n\n**Why versioning matters:**\n- Rollback becomes a one-liner: `docker service update --image yourapp:v1.2.3 mystack_app`\n- You know exactly what's running on each node\n- Audit trails for compliance\n- No more \"but it worked on my machine\" mysteries\n\n---\n\n## Useful Commands\n\n```bash\n# Node management\ndocker node ls                                              # List all nodes\ndocker node update --availability=drain docker2.domain.io   # Maintenance mode\ndocker node update --availability=active docker2.domain.io  # Back to active\ndocker node inspect docker2.domain.io --pretty              # Node details\n\n# Stack operations\ndocker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack   # Deploy/update stack\ndocker stack services mystack                       # List services in stack\ndocker stack ps mystack                             # List tasks (containers)\ndocker stack rm mystack                             # Remove stack\n\n# Service operations\ndocker service scale mystack_web=4                  # Scale to 4 replicas\ndocker service logs -f mystack_web                  # Follow logs\ndocker service logs --tail 100 mystack_web          # Last 100 lines\ndocker service update --force mystack_web           # Force redeploy\ndocker service update --image yourapp:v2 mystack_web  # Update image\n\n# Debugging\ndocker service ps mystack_web --no-trunc            # Full error messages\ndocker inspect $(docker ps -q -f name=mystack_web)  # Container details\n```\n\n**Pro tip:** `docker stack deploy` is idempotent. Run it again to update - no need to `rm` first.\n\n---\n\n## Common Gotchas\n\nThese issues have cost me hours. Learn from my pain.\n\n**Containers can't communicate between nodes:**\n1. Verify overlay network exists: `docker network ls`\n2. Check it's attached to your service in compose file\n3. Verify DNS config in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` on each node\n4. Ensure ports 7946 (TCP/UDP) and 4789 (UDP) are open between nodes\n5. If using `--opt encrypted`, try without it first (NAT issues)\n\n**Service stuck in \"Pending\":**\n```bash\ndocker service ps myservice --no-trunc\n```\nCommon causes:\n- Resource constraints - scheduler can't find a node with enough CPU/memory\n- Image doesn't exist or can't be pulled (check registry auth)\n- Placement constraints can't be satisfied\n- All nodes are drained or paused\n\n**Rolling update hangs:**\nHealth checks are usually the culprit. Your container might be healthy but Swarm doesn't know it.\n\n```yaml\nhealthcheck:\n  test: [\"CMD\", \"curl\", \"-f\", \"http://localhost:3000/health\"]\n  interval: 30s\n  timeout: 10s\n  retries: 3\n  start_period: 60s  # Give your app time to start!\n```\n\n**\"No such network\" errors:**\nCreate networks BEFORE deploying stacks:\n```bash\ndocker network create --driver overlay --attachable mynetwork\ndocker stack deploy -c compose.yml mystack\n```\n\n**Secrets not updating:**\nSecrets are immutable. To update:\n1. Create new secret with different name: `docker secret create app_secrets_v2 ./secrets.json`\n2. Update compose to reference new secret name\n3. Redeploy stack\n\n---\n\n## Final Tips\n\n1. **Use Portainer** - Free and makes Swarm management much easier. Deploy it first.\n2. **Always use external networks** - Create overlay networks before deploying stacks\n3. **Tag images properly** - Never `latest` in production. Use commit hashes or semver.\n4. **Set resource limits** - Always. A runaway container will take down your node.\n5. **Test your rollback** - Deploy a broken image intentionally to verify auto-rollback works\n6. **Monitor from day one** - Prometheus + Grafana is free and catches issues early\n7. **Document your setup** - Future you will thank present you\n8. **Start small** - 2 nodes is enough to learn. Scale when you need it.\n\n---\n\n## Backup Your Swarm State\n\nSwarm state lives on manager nodes. Back it up:\n\n```bash\n# Stop Docker (on manager)\nsudo systemctl stop docker\n\n# Backup the Swarm state\nsudo tar -cvzf swarm-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /var/lib/docker/swarm\n\n# Start Docker\nsudo systemctl start docker\n```\n\nStore backups off-node. If all managers die simultaneously (rare but possible), this is your recovery path.\n\n---\n\n## When NOT to Use Swarm\n\nTo be fair, Swarm isn't always the answer:\n\n- **Need advanced scheduling?** K8s has more sophisticated options\n- **Running 50+ services?** K8s ecosystem is more mature at scale\n- **Need service mesh?** Istio/Linkerd integrate better with K8s\n- **Team already knows K8s?** Stick with what you know\n\nFor everything else - small teams, 2-20 nodes, wanting to move fast - Swarm is hard to beat.\n\n---\n\n## GitHub Repo\n\nAll compose files, Dockerfiles, and configs mentioned in this guide:\n\n**[github.com/TheDecipherist/docker-swarm-guide](https://github.com/TheDecipherist/docker-swarm-guide)**\n\nThe repo includes:\n- Complete monitoring stack compose file\n- Production-ready multi-stage Dockerfiles\n- Network configuration examples\n- Portainer deployment scripts\n\n---\n\n## What's Coming in V2\n\nBased on community feedback, V2 will cover:\n- Deep dive into monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog comparison)\n- Blue-green deployments in Swarm\n- Logging strategies (ELK, Loki, etc.)\n- Traefik integration for automatic SSL\n\n---\n\n*What's your Swarm setup?

I need to you understand that if the *source is lossy*, converting to FLAC does nothing except waste processing power; converting is not magic, you know? The whole point of FLAC storage is that it's a *lossless* format, that you can then transcode to aac/opus/mp3. Not the other way around. This sort of thing is why I have to do frequency analysis of downloaded FLACS to make sure they're... actually FLACs and not mp3s in a trench coat.\n\nThe quality damage (artifacts) from lossy compression is already done if you download from a lossy source like youtube.

Software engineering has been my full time job for the last 20 years, so even though I've used AI for some parts of this projects, it's not fully \"vibe-coded\" and I'd like to think I applied my learnings from all these years to the whole process.\n\nNew features and contributions can be added just like any other app, no difference there.\n\nWe might like it or not (I certainly have mixed feelings myself), but this seems to be the direction the future of software development is taking. The reality is that, with no help from AI, I would not have been able to make Nametag at all because, sadly, I don't have all the free time it would take to build it \"the old way\", as much as I'd like to. So we need to think: What do we prefer? Apps that are created with AI's help, or no apps at all?  \nOn the other hand, this has opened Pandora's box and now everybody and their cousins can spin up a vibe-coded app with no previous knowledge whatsoever. This is a real pain as we are already starting to see hundreds of thousands of barely-working, unmaintained apps.  \nI don't know what to think yet. I'm just hoping for the best.\n\nI'd encourage you to give it a spin and I'd really appreciate you letting me know if there's something that you think could be improved :)",

It would be nice to have an \"add group\" button on the person's page itself, like when adding a relation\n* Add a button on the person page to record the \"last seen\" date (\"I saw this person today\" e.g.)",
