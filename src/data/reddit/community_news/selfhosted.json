Which means one thing: people are about to dig through dozens of ancient \"what's the best self-hosted Discord alternative?\" threads on here and find antiquated opinions and advice.\n\nWhat are we *actually* using? What are the clients that work well? What are options that pass the \"wife test\" of actually being something you could convince your not-techy friends and family to install on their phones? \n\nLet's get into it. I know I'm already anticipating self-hosting *something* to replace Discord for communities/friend groups who'll naturally slough off when face ID comes along.",

TL;DR became a badge proudly worn by muppets instead of the admission of laziness and stupidity that it actually is.\n\nFolk started to lose the ability to write too - resulting in the crazy idea that an email subject line should match its content slowly drifting into ancient history. A similar thing happened in forums.\n\nWith rapidly diminishing ability remaining to deal with a matching 'Subject' and 'Content' pair - this also made dealing with forums quite tricky for most people - because who wants to deal with a bunch of posts titled:\n\n- help\n- need help\n- help me\n- stuck\n- it all went wrong when i did THIS\n\nIRC also started to struggle when many folk admitted that it was simply too hard to have to find and install an app, and then use multiple pieces of information to connect to a chat room\n\n- nick\n- server\n- port\n\nThis was simply not sustainable. Three pieces of information *and* an app!? No mere human can manage it without the assistance of 2 nearby nerds.\n\nSo now you have folk that can't read much, and can't write much - this pretty well killed the idea of a searchable FAQ - so instead of having a decent FAQ that newbies can read - we need to drag new users into a walled garden chatroom where most of them can ask the same question and get multiple similar but different answers from folk that want to feel important by having flair based on activity metrics.\n\nSo enter the chat providers - with their pretty interfaces and the idea that you can have your very own chat server^*\n\n...and information that should have been free on the internet could now be sponged up by these tech-leeches and sold back to you by surrounding it with adverts and 'boosts' or the like.\n\n^* ^by ^'very ^own' ^we ^mean ^'not ^yours ^at ^all. ^we ^just ^want ^to ^monetise ^you ^and ^your ^friends'",

If you manage to add-on an SFU / livekit server for 'Element Call' the best you'll get is a zoom-like conference call experience. Element/matrix has been \"working on it\" for years now. Tbh it's a great alternative to slack/teams for larger organizations / software teams but I wouldn't at all say it's a satisfactory replacement for discord, especially with the custom \"roles\" discord has that element simply doesn't.  \n  \nI also self hosted Stoat Chat (formerly Revolt Chat) since it is aimed to be a discord clone. Sadly the UI is a mess and there's tons of bugs and missing important features. The last bug that made me remove it was no matter what option I picked for creating a voice/text channel it would only make a text channel. An example of 'important feature' missing is there's no mechanism to prevent users from creating servers on your self hosted instance. There's a github issue for it and the dev basically said 'you can disable the server-create API endpoint on your reverse proxy, but given I'm 1 person doing most of the development I can't get to this right now'. I can't blame him that's often how opensource goes, but yeah sucks to see there's no decent alternative I've found yet.",

That has active connected users distribute copies of the content so if it's popular / viral the load gets spread out.\n\nGets a bit tricky with more sensitive / private data, but technically you could safely distribute that in a similar fashion if it's encrypted with a high entropy secret from the client, nobody else would be able to decrypt it then, only help by being a content mirror.",

Video quality is actually way nicer than what discord was giving us, so that's a plus.\n\nI have a bunch of friends trying it out so far, and we like it. Feels like it's trying to be slack and discord at the same time. Once the users get adjusted, I can see this being something we all get a lot of use out of.",

In that case it actually works great.\n\nBut yes, if you don't use the ESS but instead try to just use synapse (the back-end server) directly, installation and maintenance is indeed pain.

That \"I'm the odd one out\" impulse works both ways.\n\nEveryone thought Plex/Jellyfin was just for hyper-nerds and pirates because there was no way in hell people could convince their friends to connect to some sketchy website to watch ripped blurays.\n\nNow there's a Jellyfin client on just about every major device people use to watch movies and TV. I know tons of people who've never touched SSH or know what a seedbox is, yet they regularly watch stuff on Plex and/or Jellyfin servers from people they know.\n\n'cus, more often than not, a lot of people will passively have beef with Discord for one reason or another. If you stand up and say \"here is an alternative. I've already put in the effort of setting it up so all you have to do is *install a single app on your phone\"* then you have an incredibly high chance of talking people who actually speak a lot in the community into coming over.\n\nAnd if those people come over, you bring the tag-alongs who want to lurk in active communities.\n\nIt's a domino effect, it just requires one or two extroverts to be loudly and proudly into the alternative. I've been through friend groups leaving Skype for Teamspeak, leaving Teamspeak for Mumble, leaving Mumble for Razer Comms, leaving Razer Comms for Discord.

As far as closest feature set to Discord that has \"enough\" polish for Discord familiar users to use (including custom Emoji's), Mattermost checks most of the boxes, though not great if you need extended features like calls and such since even with self host you have to pay for. I don't need that but others have used Jitsi as an alternative or TeamSpeak I guess.\n\nI do like the interface on Matrix better in some cases, but just the pace of improvements (using Schildichat instead of stock Element btw) across the 10+ years I've been using it, the resource bloat, the foundation financial troubles, the crazy install procedures (yes even with the Ansible playbook), and the entire CSAM stuff on the main server, really put me off. Yes, there's a reason why Matrix is used by government agencies, but I'm just not comfortable with the idea of my server possibly being exploited as a distribution node for CSAM. It's unlikely, but I'm not taking that chance.\n\nSo for now, till these other self hosted options like Foscord and such become much more production ready, I'm settling on Mattermost for now. For larger servers, you may run into some limitations, but for my small needs, it's fine.\n\nI have also tried to like XMPP as an alternative, and even though the protocol is solid, the clients just aren't good enough.",

If one goes down or gets taken over by assholes, you just switch providers without having to upend the whole ecosystem.\n\nThere are people commercializing a \"modern\" IRC client stack that includes mobile apps, e.g. [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com/), along with FOSS stuff like [The Lounge](https://convos.chat/) and [Convos](https://thelounge.chat/).",

          "text": "I’m building a Discord-style chat app called [Secret](https://secretapp.io/) that’s self-hosted, decentralized and privacy-first.\n\nA few points that might be interesting:\n\n* **Self-hosted / user-hosted** – any user can run a host (server or even from the app) to store and share communities. No central server that everything depends on.\n* **Decentralized** – accounts and communities are spread across many hosts, and clients verify everything locally. It's the most decentralized messenger ever created.\n* **Privacy** – end-to-end encryption (MLS in groups / communities), no PII, minimal metadata, and it can work in local/offline setups too.\n\nRight now I’m looking for people who care about self-hosting and decentralization and are willing to try it early, give feedback, or just say “keep going”. This thing is pretty hard to build and I honestly need support (any kind – even mental) and testers. Eventually it will be open-sourced, of course.\n\nWatch the full app demo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hExvh8m6r4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hExvh8m6r4)\n\nWe’re planning the first alpha next month. If you’re interested, just reply to this comment and I’ll send you a TestFlight / Play Store link directly when it’s ready.",

          "text": "I care a lot about this too, as I'm part of a lot of communities that made their home on Discord and now want to jump ship if they can. But it's not so simple, because Discord, with all of their privacy violating garbage, does a lot under the hood that keeps users there.\n\nThe features I know that many users are looking for are:\n\n- Text channels with the ability to post images and links\n- Voice channels *that just work*\n- Ability to stream at 30 fps or better *that just works*\n- Using bots, both text and audio\n- Stickers\n- Animated emojis\n- Easy onboarding\n\nI know it sounds silly to list animated emojis as a major feature that users care about, but it needs to be said and emphasized. Users are *a lot* about stuff like that, as it lets them express themselves the way they want, and make their communities unique and feel special. If an open source or self-hosted alternative to Discord wants to bring in users, this is what it needs!\n\nThe most obvious candidate seems to be Matrix, but the last time I looked at it, it could do text channels with links and pics just fine. But that's about it. It didn't have the community customization features of Discord that users care about so much. It didn't have dedicated audio channels, and its nearest equivalent were voice calls more geared towards corporate environments and also didn't work out of the box -- I got weird errors that would be an instant turnoff for any non-tech savvy user. The onboarding process had enough friction to drive away a lot of users, which is probably the biggest problem with most of these federated apps.\n\nAlso, Matrix was *not* easy to self-host. It has *a ton* of moving parts, and updating it would frequently cause things to break with inscrutable database errors I had no idea how to fix. I might consider *paying* someone to host and manage Matrix for me, so that I don't have to deal with that, but that's going to be a non-starter for 99% of the communities out there.\n\nSo I'm curious what else is out there. I know that a replacement for Discord is asking a lot, and maybe the best way can do is a service that just has text channels. That would at least work for a lot of communities, but the easy to use voice chat / video chat / streaming / hangout spaces is a *big* part of why Discord won in this space.",

If someone has less than the required number of parts, they have the equivalent amount of information as having 0 parts. This algorithm does not get weaker with quantum computers. \n\nThe algorithm is based on the idea for how you uniquely define a polynomial. \n\nIf you have 2 points on a line, you can find the equation for that line. You make the secret you’re trying to encrypt the Y value where X=0 for that equation and pick a random slope. Then, you give people points on the graph. You can give out as many points on the graph as you want, and no matter what, no one will be able to find the Y intercept unless they get 2 points. But any 2 points will find it. \n\nThis scales up. If you want 3 people to work together like OP, you use a quadratic equation. Now you need 3 points to uniquely define your equation. \n\nThere are additional steps in the actual algorithm to further obscure the values against other weaknesses, but this is how the core math works. \n\nExtremely clever algorithm. \n\nOp this is a perfect application of this algorithm, great work!",

I just wanted to avoid that mess entirely.\n\nI didn't want to pay for a VPS to host Vaultwarden, but honestly, the main reason was that I don't trust myself. Managing a Linux server means one bad command or missed backup and my passwords are gone forever. I wanted something maintenance-free where I couldn't accidentally nuke my own vault.\n\nSo, I hacked together a Bitwarden-compatible server that runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers + D1 for free. Deploy once, forget forever.\n\nI called it `warden-worker`. It worked \"good enough\" for me, so I pushed it to GitHub, thought \"maybe I'll post this later,\" and then immediately forgot about it.\n\nFast forward to this week. I was doing some repo cleanup and realized I had turned off my GitHub notifications. I checked the repo and... what??\n\n* 400+ forks\n* Issues threads in Chinese?\n* People writing guides on how to deploy it??\n* Someone explaining how to fix my bugs in the issues\n\nThe best part is that a user named qaz741wsd856 apparently took my abandoned skeleton and turned it into a full-blown project with KV support and the actual Vaultwarden frontend. Their fork is objectively better than mine in every way.\n\nI'm still using my original \"good enough\" version because it’s stable and I’m lazy, but it's wild to see an entire community spin up around a project I thought was dead.\n\nIf you want the original (don't use this): [https://github.com/deep-gaurav/warden-worker](https://github.com/deep-gaurav/warden-worker) \n\nIf you want the one that actually works (use this): [https://github.com/qaz741wsd856/warden-worker](https://github.com/qaz741wsd856/warden-worker)\n\nJust wanted to share because I'm still processing how weird open source can be sometimes.",

That works out to be about $4.5 dollars per day since the first donation. A large portion of these donations have come from the last few weeks.\n\n  \nThis includes a mix of one-time donations (largest ever was $50) and monthly donations. Currently, I make about $35 month due to monthly recurring donations.\n\n  \nIt took about 6,000 GitHub stars before I received the first donation through GitHub Sponsors. Termix now sits at just over 10,000 for reference, with \\~4 million Docker pulls.\n\n  \nIn my case, there are no incentives to donate for any reason (no benefit other than a badge on your GitHub profile). The default and smallest donation amount that I have on my donation page is $1/month.\n\n  \nIn a few months (maybe a year), I'll do another post updating everyone who is curious!\n\n  \nThanks,  \nLuke",

I receive maybe 1 donation every 6 months and get about $3-$4 in ad revenue share per day, so $100/month or so. So ya, I feel ya. Overall, I am fine with it. I do it as a hobby because I enjoy it, not to replace my day job.\n\nI post this for context for people to understand that the vast majority of software out there like this that is free cannot in any way be sustainable. That's why I wasn't even surprised when I heard the TailwindCSS team got cut from 4 people to 1, and that they were dropping the few devs they had. The fact they even earned enough to afford even afford multiple developers, even with industry-wide popular software with nearly 100,000 stars on Github is pretty astonishing. At the end of the day, donation-based models just are not really sustainable. If you want to make an income over your free, open source, self-hosted app you create, you better have something that millions wants and then have a premium model people can purchase. The donation model does not work for 99% of devs. The only people making any money from donations is because of gifts from live streaming, or from extraordinarily popular Patreon exclusive projects people can subscribe to.\n\nI once setup a Patreon and got about $40/month in subs. The problem is the whole hassle of doing it all, trying to come up with exclusive stuff for Patreon, or just the weird vibe you now get from some people who sub $5 and now expect special treatment, wasn't really worth it to for me.",

I've seen surges destroy everything on a 5V rail, but leave 12V rails alone. I've also seen power supplies have just one rail go bad - producing about 50% of the amperage it should, so the system works fine until a load is put on the rail (like a GPU being pushed hard).

The frequency of the freezes increased over time. Obviously my first thought was, that the GPU is faulty and obviously I was wrong. \n\nThen the BSOD codes changed and did hint to a SSD problem which seemed likely given it was rather old. So swapped, reinstalled Windows and thought that was it. Of course I was wrong again, after a day I got the same errors. Changed RAMs, used a single bar in different slots, still nothing. Then I tried the PSU in another PC and used it a few hours, no freezes once again. \n\nAfter a lot of back and forth I gave up because I didn't need that PC anymore in this configuration and reused the PSU for another mainboard on a benchtable with totally different components and after about a day of useage, boom - same error, again hinting at the GPU drivers. Turns out that this specific PSU is known for instable rails under load. Apparently this caused the GPU driver to crash, which made Windows BSOD after some time but not immediately. Tested with reinstalling the OS on the first PC in it's original configuration and sure enough I had a day of peace until it started to crash every few minutes.\n\nSo yeah, you are right, power issues are hard to diagnose.",

I got a great deal on some double-conversion UPS's, love them much.\n\na normal UPS monitors the power coming from the wall and uses a relay to switch over to battery if there are problems detected with the power. it's all or nothing, it doesn't catch every small problem, and they don't work with non-inverter type generators. if you use a UPS with a generator, and it's not the inverter type generator, the AC frequency will change with the RPM of the motor, and the UPS will see this as a problem and just keep using battery.\n\na double-conversion UPS doesn't have that relay, and instead, it runs the inverter 24/7. this means they use a bit more power, but the electronics inside them are much better built. they take the AC power from the wall, convert it to DC, then convert it back to AC again with a clean and perfect voltage and frequency.\n\nI tried mine on a variac once, I found it doesn't switch over to battery until the power from the wall goes down to around 55 volts. it will happily take 60 volts from the wall at any frequency, boost it back up to 120 volts, and keep my equipment running safely. it's not free energy though. if I'm only giving it 60 volts, it will pull double the current from the wall so it still uses the same watts. they also work with basically any generator.",

I use Plappa to connect to AudioBookShelf. So from the point of downloading something in Shelfmark to it appearing automatically on my phone app it takes only a few seconds to a minute.\n\nOf course, the metadata sometimes can be wrong and the book I download might be something completely different, but it doesn't happen very often. I am pretty much entirely independend now, both with audiobook and ebook management. I can load up my devices on the go. Progress sync works perfectly. It's pretty fantastic.\n\nAnd also, the app itself (Plappa, wich is use on iOS) is very much superior to the Audible app.",

My Brother laser printer, which only cost $75 in 2008 but has worked like a champ and survived four houses, three time zones, two kids, a university degree, and my entire career to date.\n\nLately however, its struggling. It won't hold a network connection for much longer than 15 minutes, and once it loses it, only a power cycle will bring it back online.\n\nI've tried everything. Wifi, ethernet, dedicated VLAN, static IP, DHCP changes, RTSP on, RTSP off, scripts to ping the printer every 5 minutes.\n\nA normal person would have bought a new printer. A sane person would just decide to turn the printer on when they need it.\n\n**I am apparently too stubborn to be a normal person**\n\nWhy would I spend money on a new printer when I have time I can waste on the problem instead? And why would I resign myself to walking across the room when I can build something to do it for me instead?\n\nSo I built a \"Legacy Hardware Integration Bridge\":\n\n- A CUPS print server running in a docker on my Unraid machine is now the \"printer\" for all my computers. The server stays always on, so the computers never see a \"Printer Offline\" error\n- When a print job hits the CUPS queue, it triggers a state change to a sensor entity on my Home Assistant server using the Internet Printer Protocol integration\n- The state change on that sensor acts as a trigger to an automation, which causes a smart plug to switch on\n- That smart plug is now controlling the power to the printer, so when it switches on, the printer boots up, and gets a fresh connection to the network\n- Once the printer has been idle for 5 minutes, it triggers the smart plug to turn off, and everything is ready for the next print job.\n\nMy wife thinks I could have just turned the printer on whenever I needed it and spent my Sunday doing something more productive.\n \nI'm not a caveman though.

Before that I had made my own using the RESTful api. You could do the same if the IPP integration doesn't work for whatever reason. Just add something like this to your configuration.yaml:\n\n```\n    -sensor:\n        - platform: rest\n        name: \"Printer Job Count\"\n        # Replace with your CUPS IP and the EXACT printer name from CUPS resource: http://10.0.1.10:631/printers/HL-2700DW\n        scan_interval: 10\n        # This magic regex counts the number of times \"Process ID\" appears in the queue page\n        value_template: >\n        {{ value | regex_findall('Process ID') | list | length }}\n```\n\nAnd the my automations look like this (you'll have to change the trigger to be \"Printer Job Count\" > 1 if you go that route):\n\n```\nalias: Turn on printer when there's a print job\ndescription: \"\"\ntriggers:\n  - trigger: state\n    entity_id:\n      - sensor.brother_hl_2270dw_series_using_brlaser_v6\n    to:\n      - printing\n    from: null\nconditions:\n  - condition: state\n    entity_id: switch.printer_power\n    state:\n      - \"off\"\nactions:\n  - action: switch.turn_on\n    metadata: {}\n    target:\n      entity_id: switch.printer_power\n    data: {}\nmode: single\n```\n\n```\nalias: Power off printer when there's no print jobs\ndescription: \"\"\ntriggers:\n  - trigger: state\n    entity_id:\n      - sensor.brother_hl_2270dw_series_using_brlaser_v6\n    for:\n      hours: 0\n      minutes: 5\n      seconds: 0\n    to:\n      - idle\nconditions: []\nactions:\n  - action: switch.turn_off\n    metadata: {}\n    target:\n      entity_id: switch.printer_power\n    data: {}\nmode: single\n```",

I replied this to an earlier comment that got buried because of the downvotes, so I'm gonna paste this here for clarity as I'm pretty self-conscious about my writing and I'm not about to reply to every single negative comment.\n\n> I wrote every single letter of this post myself. You can check the edit history to see how many typos and poorly worded sentences I had in the initial post and how many times I've edited it since then. If you want to expose me for being an LLM, I can give you some consolation and tell you that I have LanguageTools extension installed, but apparently using commas and periods correctly makes me a robot now. Beep boop.\n\nNow I realize that reddit doesn't allow for checking the edit history but fuck it. Next time I write a post (probably never), I'll go out of my way to make it unpolished I guess.\n\nAs for the \"you must have a lot of time\" folks, well, yeah, this post took me 20-25 minutes? It was like 2am, I had time, I bust out my laptop and just started writing it. The initial post had a lot of embarrassing typos, I edited the post a few times.\n\nIf you're about to say \"jesus christ this guy is crashing out over a reddit post\", well, you're right, you won, congrats. I'm an LLM, being enthusiastic is bad, and I should write like an illiterate degenerate. I didn't think I would wake up to a bunch of \"get a load of this guy\" comments... serves me right for thinking I could express my honest feelings on reddit.\n\n**-- ORIGINAL POST BELOW --**\n\nSo a few weeks ago, one of my close friends got into homelabbing and naturally started talking to me about it. I've always wanted to try similar things but never got around to it, so this time I just said what the hell and after some research, I ordered NanoPi R6S. I found it to be a solid upper mid-range device that could satisfy my thirst for knowledge and help me learn the niche.\n\nNow, I'm pretty good with tech, and I'm very enthusiastic about it, but I'm a total noob when it comes to networking. I know what LAN stands for, and I know how to set up a Cloudflare DNS on an ISP modem, but apart from that, I might as well be a boomer. I'm kinda nervous about setting up a new router, messing with its firmware, opening ports, configuring firewall, and so on.\n\nNR6S arrives and I start researching firmware options. OpenWrt just calls my name because I have used it once years ago, and I didn't really find anything wrong with it.\n\nAfter some trial and error, I managed to flash OpenWrt on the eMMC storage of NR6S, thanks to this [absolute chad](https://github.com/StarWhiz/NanoPi-R6S-CPU-Optimization-for-Gigabit-SQM/tree/main/How%20To%20Flash%20Official%20OpenWrt%20To%20R6S%20eMMC).\n\nOkay, I now have NR6S powered by OpenWrt standing between my ISP modem and my Wi-Fi AP. I find a lot of people mentioning bridging the router on forums, so I start looking into what bridging is. OF COURSE, it makes sense, for years both my ISP modem and my Wi-Fi AP have been doing routing, but both are terribly underpowered for that task, so I can now have a dedicated ROUTER for that. I bridge the ISP modem, set my Wi-Fi unit as Dumb AP, and I already feel better about myself. But, I need some more ports... I find Netgear GS308 locally for dirt cheap and for the first time in my life, I have a dedicated network switch. Pretty cool... I guess? WAIT, you're telling me that connecting 2 of my PCs to a single switch allows me to transfer Steam games over LAN? I don't have to wait twice as long for game downloads to play something with my brother? I can just send him game files at gigabit speeds instead of my ISPs shitty 100Mbps? W switch, W Valve, W whoever's reddit comment I came upon about Steam's LAN feature.\n\nOkay, now that I have stable internet, let's Google \"self-hosted projects reddit.\" I find tons of threads, and I find some project names coming up in every single one of these threads. AdGuard Home sounds interesting, it can block ads, trackers, AND help me monitor who and what is using my bandwidth? Let's fucking go. How can I deploy it? Docker, huh? Well hello old friend, you've saved me countless hours deploying my clients' websites on VPSes, let's see how I can set you up on an OpenWrt. Well, that took less than 20 minutes, nice.\n\nI now have Docker, but do I want to ssh into my router every time I want to change a config, see the status of my containers, or restart them? There has to be a solution for that. Huh, there is, and it's called Dockge, cool. Wait, Dockge developer also has this pretty cool project called Uptime Kuma, which will give me a fancy interface for monitoring the status for all of my services. Both of them deployed in less than 10 minutes, just following the official instructions.\n\nOkay, back to AdGuard Home, what can I do here? Holy shit I can just delegate AdGuard Home to be my DNS resolver and configure a bunch of options for it? Count me in. 20 minutes of brokering peace between AGH and OpenWrt over port 80, and now I have redundant DNS resolvers, resolving all of my domain needs using parallel requests to get me to websites ASAP. Oh, and I can see AGH blocking all the TikTok and Google trackers from my family's devices, so I already want to buy a coffee for the developers.\n\nI'm fucking hooked. Let's Google some more interesting projects. Immich? I can take my data back from Google? The app looks just as fancy, and I don't care for some of the features it lacks. What could I use for storage? Maybe this spare Samsung T7 Shield I have lying around? Let's go. Export the whole data from Google Photos, mount my T7 to NR6S with a USB cable, permanently mounted it in OpenWrt, used [Immich-Go](https://github.com/simulot/immich-go) to upload it to Immich, and bob's your uncle. So. fucking. cool.\n\nWait, now I have anxiety about losing years of my photos and videos if I fully migrate to Immich. How can I fix that? Immich recommends 3-2-1 backup strategy, and they link this [article](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/) from Backblaze. Hmm, I've heard that name before. Wait, these guys will give me terabyte of storage for $6/month? Wtf do I pay Google for? But wait, how can I upload there? God bless rclone. Let's also clone to my Windows PC to fully complete the 3-2-1 strategy. Let's automate cloning processes for both local and remote backups, so that all my data gets backed up every night while I'm sleeping. All that work in less than two hours.\n\nBy the way, I thought Immich app was supposed to be inferior to Google Photos? Are you serious? I finally have a reliable search by context, file name, file extension, etc. I can set up auto-moving and archiving with CLI and so much more. Fuck Google Photos. Delete every single byte I have on there, uninstall it from all of my devices, cancel the subscription.\n\nOkay, this post is getting terribly long, so I'll try to fast-forward.\n\nI want to remotely turn on my stupid Samsung monitor without using a remote? Home Assistant.\n\nI want to have a universal note-taking and link-saving solution? Linkwarden.\n\nI want to expose my services to the internet so I can access them remotely? Cloudflared.\n\nI want to stash my fucking porn? Stash.\n\nThere are solutions for literally everything. My post serves two purposes. The first is to push all of you lurking in this subreddit, hesitant to pull the trigger, thinking you need to be Gilfoyle reincarnated to have any success at this stuff. My modest home lab is no Anton, but boy does it make this shitty corpo-ridden internet a much more tolerable place. All I needed to have was a bit of Googling skills, and a bit of patience reading through the official docs, forum threads, and reddit comments. I still have a LOT to learn about networking, but I already feel like this has been one of the most fulfilling hobbies I've had, and I'm already thinking about getting a NAS to host some stuff for my friends.\n\nSecond is to say a massive thank you to the absolute legends behind all the open-source services that we all use and love. I'm sure I will find a lot more in the coming months, and I will try my absolute best to buy all of them a coffee.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone's even going to read all of this, I just felt so good about and so passionate about my new hobby that I wanted to share it with everyone.\n\nP.S: This subreddit desperately needs a \"Discussion\" flair.",

Turns out I can just enable SQM and now I can download whatever I want when my brother plays an online game. As for the limitations, yeah, the biggest limitation I found so far is that it uses Ash instead of Bash. It tripped me up quite a few times. Also, after setting up Immich, I found that I cannot use hardware-accelerated ML and hardware transcoding, because some drivers for NanoPi R6S are not upstreamed in OpenWrt. I'm not sure if FriendlyWrt has those drivers, and I'm not sure if I want to try. Needless to say I'll be upgrading to something more powerful down the line.

I've been accused of it myself multiple times (it's also a well known fact that neurodivergent people have similarities with how we write prose, that LLM detectors flag us for written exams at university).\n\nI've accused a few people of using LLMs myself, not necessarily in a bad way but from an observation that there was enough similarity I put out that possibility openly and they got deeply offended.\n\nAs your journey progresses you may encounter more exposure to such and likewise understand why this happens or people get triggered by it. Try not to let that get to you, it's not you specifically but just a growing concern as well he use of AI adoption spreads and impairs judgement.. Verbose communication and a more diverse vocabulary will get stereotyped as an LLM 🙄",

Whatever alternative would become popular, it would need to abide by the same laws in UK for people from UK, for example. If not right now, then once the UK government comes after it.

I did some tests and didn't feel comfortable with just printing rasterized images, I couldn't get it to look the same as native text no matter how hard I tried. \n\nI built a very over-engineered Intermediate Representation pipeline. Basically I have an internal language that represents how things visually will look in the printer, and then translate that to StarPRNT commands, after doing optimization rounds.\n\nIt's quite advanced, you can read more about it here [https://github.com/eljojo/estrella#how-it-works-the-compilation-pipeline](https://github.com/eljojo/estrella#how-it-works-the-compilation-pipeline) \n\nFor markdown specifically, I have a markdown renderer that takes markdown and outputs this \"IR code\" which my app then translates into StarPRNT commands. What's cool is that I also have a PNG renderer that can take that \"IR Code\" and render a PNG showing how the receipt would look like, so for example I can render a markdown to PNG by passing it through that \"IR Code\".\n\nsounds like you have a thermal printer yourself? how do you like it? have you found other usecases beyond morning news?

We can set this up using github actions so it's built automatically. Would you be interested in trying out a PR for this?\n\nAs an alternative, If you happen to be familiar or interested in [NixOS](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/NixOS_Wiki), this might be a good time for it. This is my setup and it's quite comfortable. -- This would require [installing NixOS on the raspberry pi](https://github.com/nvmd/nixos-raspberrypi) and then using flakes to deploy into the pi. I use a free ARM VM in Oracle to build my pi, so it goes fairly fast. I can walk you through some of this if you're willing to go down the rabbit hole.

If you're lucky, the USB one shows up as a serial device in linux and you can just set the path to it and it would work, if not, more work might be required, but I doubt it.\n\nIf you want to play it safe, buy bluetooth. If you're down for tinkering a little, the worst case scenario is likely not much work either way, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. It'd be great to confirm if USB works.\n\nYou can tell apart the bluetooth version because it says PAIR on the back.\n\nif you get one, send me an email (found on my website)",

I assume they run multiple daemons (sharing the same private key) on multiple machines in some sort of load-balanced setup. I'd be interested to know if anyone has info on that.",

Think Overseerr/Jellyseerr + Radarr/Sonarr, but purpose-built for\n  audiobooks. Request a book, and it handles the rest: searches indexers, downloads, organizes files, and triggers a library scan. Done.\n\n## What it does:\n\n  - Plex and Audiobookshelf support (your choice)\n  - Torrents via qBittorrent + Usenet via SABnzbd\n  - Prowlarr for indexer search (torrents + NZBs)\n  - One-click requests with full automation pipeline\n  - Chapter merging - multi-file downloads automatically merged into a single M4B with chapters\n  - E-book sidecar - optional EBook downloads alongside your audiobooks (And file repair for kindle import)\n  - BookDate - AI-powered audiobook recommendations with a Tinder-style swipe interface (OpenAI/Claude/Local)\n  - Request approval workflows for multi-user setups\n  - OIDC authentication support (Authentik, Keycloak, etc.)\n  - Step-by-step setup wizard with connection testing\n  - Single Docker container - just docker compose up -d and go\n\n## Screenshots:\n\n  https://imgur.com/a/2nHmVSk\n\n## What's changed since the beta posts:\n\n  A lot. Usenet support, Audiobookshelf integration, OIDC auth, e-book downloads, chapter merging, admin approval workflows, notification support (Discord/Pushover), and honestly too many\n  fixes and improvements to list. The beta testers put this thing through hell and it's significantly better for it.\n\n## Thank you to the beta community:\n\n  Genuinely - this release wouldn't be what it is without the people who jumped in early, broke things, reported bugs, and gave feedback. You all shaped this project in ways I couldn't have on\n   my own. Thank you.\n\n## Get involved:\n\n  GitHub: https://github.com/kikootwo/readmeabook\n\n  Discord: https://discord.gg/kaw6jKbKts\n\n  The repo is public and contributions are welcome. Whether it's features, bug fixes, or documentation - if you want to get involved, the Discord is the best place to start. It's also where\n  you'll find setup help and general discussion.\n\n## Tech details:\n\n  - Stack: Next.js, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis\n  - Deployment: Single Docker container (embedded PostgreSQL/Redis)\n  - Auth: Plex OAuth, Audiobookshelf OIDC, Local Registration\n  - Integrations: Plex, Audiobookshelf, Prowlarr, qBittorrent, SABnzbd\n  - License: AGPL v3\n\n\n---\n  If you've ever been frustrated trying to get audiobook automation working with tools that weren't built for it, come give this a shot. And if you're not ready to self-host yet, come hang out in the Discord anyway - would love to hear what you'd want from a tool like this.",

Would you consider having the unified image check for these env vars at startup and skip launching the internal Postgres/Redis when they're provided? This is a pretty common pattern in similar self-hosted apps. Immich, Baserow, and others do exactly this, letting users point at external databases without needing a separate image.\n\nSince Prisma already reads DATABASE_URL natively, the main change would just be conditional logic in the entrypoint to skip the internal service startup.",

We start the request knowing the ASIN, then match release names to the given title/author (only unsure part), then the request has the ASIN attached. Then when we organize the files we create a file list hash that we compare against the files reported by ABS which allows us to accurately ASIN match in ABS. \n\nIf we just look at file names and try to match to audiobooks it leaves a lot more room for mismatches",

API keys also allow scoping, so you can create readonly API keys that cannot write data.\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.lubelogger.com/Advanced/API#api-keys)\n\n## Major UI Enhancement\n\nThe UI in LubeLogger is not great, especially on mobile, but we have made some big strides in improving the UI to hopefully make it a more bearable on small screens.\n\n[List of UI changes](https://hargata.github.io/hargata/lubelogger_159_ui_enhancement.pdf)\n\n## There are two versions released a day apart\n\nIf you head over to our GitHub repo right now, you might see that there are two versions(1.5.9 and 1.6.0) released a day apart.\n\n### What version should I upgrade to?\n\nIf you are already running a version of LubeLogger, upgrade to 1.5.9 if you want all of the enhancements listed above but are not in a position to troubleshoot potential breaking changes. The only difference is that 1.6.0 is pointed towards .NET 10 instead of 8 and the docker image is now Ubuntu and no longer Debian-based. There might be some breaking changes that stem from this depending on your set up.\n\n### What version should I install?\n\nIf this is your first time installing LubeLogger, go with the latest version which is 1.6.0 at the time of writing, as we don't plan on rolling back the .NET 10 migration.\n\n## No AI Statement(because it's not Friday)\n\nLubeLogger is not written with the assistance of AI, and is instead written by two very tired people in Eastern Utah. Some external PR's that we have received from third party contributors might have been AI-assisted(there's no way of knowing), but be rest-assured that the code has been thoroughly reviewed and tested before they're merged in.\n\n## Links\n\n[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hargata/lubelog)\n\n[Website](https://lubelogger.com)",

That way if you mess around with versions (1.5.9 vs 1.6.0) you’re not worried about losing anything.\n\nAlso, if you run it in Docker already, going straight to 1.6.0 is probably fine. If it’s on a tiny old box or some weird setup, 1.5.9 is the “sleep better tonight” choice.",

That plus self hosted makes this feel very “trustable” for nerds who don’t want their car history in some random SaaS.\n\nThe honest bit about .NET 10 vs 8 and telling existing users to stick to 1.5.9 if they don’t want to debug stuff is appreciated. Too many projects silently break people’s stacks in the name of “latest everything”.\n\nUI screenshots in the PDF look noticeably less cramped on mobile too.

So while ~$40-$60 upfront is a lot more than free, there’s no need to seed, download speeds are as fast as your ISP speed, and traffic is encrypted over SSL.

Getting caught and having to pay a potential fine of several thousend Euro is a risk i am not willing to take anymore. There are, in total, maybe 5 new Movies a year i really want to watch. If they are big enough i'll choose the cinema experience anyways. For everything else, i either wait for streaming or just buy the movie for 10-20€ depending on how long i want to wait.\n\nWhat i do now, i have bought a UHD Bluray drive for my PC that can properly rip 4k content. So for building my library i just buy the bluray (mostly used) and rip it to disc. Most Discs i keep, some i resell.

You could also say that you didn't have a password on your wifi when the download took place. Now it could be anyone.\n\n\nBut ignoring the problem of pinpointing the specific person, there are also steps people can take to protect them self.\n\n\nThe main thing is to force all your network clients to use encrypted DNS. By doing this your ISP will no longer know which domains you visit.\nMultiple sites can be hosted on a single IP - so just knowing the IP you visit proves nothing.\nCombine that with encrypted traffic (https), and no one will be able to see what you are looking at on those IPs.\nIf you also stop using public trackers, then it significantly decreases the risk of content owners just downloading a torrent file and using the peer IP list to find you. \n\n\nWith a bit of luck and effort a content owner could of course get access to a private tracker and still get a list of peer IPs. But that still leaves the problem of pinpointing specifically who it was that downloaded the file.\n\n\nEven if they manage all that, they can only claim lost money.

So even then people torrent because there's no point paying 10-20$ for Netflix without localization, when you cat torrent for free with full bandwidth of 200-1000 mbits/sec, yeah we have full fiber connection in big cities, not like other European countries (like I heard in Germany most people are using adls💀)",

Not really. But I do like the ideology behind the app. It's just not something that I'd consider an alternative to Discord.

If you’re setting up Spacebar and looking to self-host, make sure you’ve got a solid understanding of Docker or similar containerization tools, as these often simplify deployment. You’ll also want to ensure your server has the necessary resources and security measures in place, like a firewall and SSL certificates for secure connections. \n\nFor a reverse-engineered platform like this, keep an eye on updates from the developers, as alpha versions can be pretty fluid. If you run into specific issues, check out their GitHub repository for any open issues or documentation they might have. Good luck with your setup!",

But I'm repeatedly the only user of them because my friends either don't share the enthusiasm or the need, other than the media server. \n\nBut my partner also doesn't really have an interest. She has no intent or desire to install the HomeAssistant app, despite it providing additional functionality to our home as it also has Device Tracker permissions. Even if they can be disabled, that they exist is a bit of an ick factor. For these things, I poke holes like HomeKit, but that's unfortunately limited.\n\nI've provided her with access to Plex/Jellyfin/Overseerr/Lidarr but because I approve/fulfill the requests and can see a detailed view/listen history of each of my users, I have this weird insight into all of it as if the applications are tattling. \n\nTo be clear, I don't really care about my users' activity unless they have an issue with a piece of media that I need to fix. I don't know that I would care about other users in HomeAssistant, but I can't speak on hypotheticals because I am, again, the only user.\n\nIt's not a trust issue. We've been together nearly 20 years and married just short of a decade. We have shared bank accounts and children. It's more of a surveillance issue.\n\nThis applies to any other service I host. Paperless-ngx, Invidious, Dispatcharr, Immich. All have the issue where the self-hosting user has God Mode over all of it.\n\nHow do you deal with having God Mode over your users? Or do they even care?",

(In fact, it's likely he can spy on that even via the HomeKit integration.)\n\nSo he is somehow conflating \"not installing the app\" with \"god mode\" for no logical reason.\n\nMaybe his friends actually care about God mode -- but to me it could be that they don't *want* a login because it's a hassle, and they don't see any benefits. (i.e. Imagine that he only has a few pirated movies. Sure, exciting for him, but I honestly couldn't be bothered if he offered me an account either.
