It's posting it on Reddit after as a full project. GitHub is supposed to be basically LinkedIn for your software projects.

I spun up a Proxmox LXC container with Gitea to store all the scripts, but instead of referencing Git cheat-sheets, like I’ve done in the past, I used Claude to write a shell script that automated some basic Git commands with a simple menu. It worked great. I tagged it as “Built with AI” and shared it here.\n\nIt's a basic utility script, and I didn’t think it was a big deal, but I quickly found out otherwise. I was personally attacked and accused of posting “AI slop,” and also by the “Git-stapo” for being lazy and not learning GIT commands (fair enough). Someone mentioned it shouldn't be under /selfhosted.  Another user pointed out potential vulnerabilities in the script, rewrote it, and sent it to me in chat (they really did a great job) but I thought it best to just delete the post and move on.

There's no real review in place either.\n\nUses CalVer instead of semver, so breaking changes are abound, I can't quite recall if there was a change log in place but pretty sure some changes I encountered weren't covered I found them via git blame / history.\n\nIssues aren't available, he decided to delegate to community instead. I reported a bug about a recent change and there's been no interaction for weeks.\n\nHe's been embracing NIH syndrome by vibe coding tools like `fnox` (secrets management or something like that IIRC) instead of integrating with the community and what's well established there.\n\nOne project claims that he stole their own apparently vibe coded project as a base, but IIRC it was previously used and then he had his AI tools create a new alternative from scratch based on the existing integration API and any changes he wanted. There wasn't any forking done, nor attempt to collaborate.\n\nThe dev is quite confident in the security of it and that it's trustworthy, yet given all the other tools he's vibe coding and the PRs that come along to fix regression slop (tests fail but he still merges the PRs), it's not giving much faith.\n\nHe seems to be slowly replacing any of the ecosystem he integrated with and removing those past integrations. Those that have multiple backend options still aren't consistent with some features or lack a global ENV (only offering backend specific ENV for config common between the two), it's also looking like it's trying to do way too much with the feature sprawl.\n\nAnd yet... It technically is one of the few OSS options out there that can do a variety of things you'd want in a tool. I am just conflicted about it because I've seen the development process and find that rather concerning to rely on or trust security wise. There's tonnes of praise  `mise` is popular but is it contribution friendly? How much of it is AI slop?

Then I hit a bug from an update and realised I couldn't raise an issue (I did file a detailed report via discussions, but no engagement for weeks so far).\n\nThen trying to look through the source and git blame to identify the cause I found the PR change and subsequent regression fix, but after seeing the dev process and code base I just did not feel like I even wanted to contribute further and questioned if this was really a tool worth adopting (it is very capable compared to alternatives, but is getting feature sprawl, and vibe coded security tooling when they're not a dev with notable security background to my knowledge so their confidence in it is questionable).\n\nMost vibe coded projects I expect won't survive as long, I think there's a tendency to build but not maintain (boring), so after some time the dev moves on to something new / shiny and abandons it.\n\nNot sure about that being the case with projects like mise which does have a tonne of github stars, but I'm also a bit weary of these kind that do become well established despite their flaws.",

Even if you review and understand every line in your codebase. Or if you use the AI to write the readme/docs.\n\nTo others, vibe coded is a label of poor quality. It has a meaning like slop. The creator doesn't understand what has been created and it is likely filled with quality issues.\n\nIt seems like both meanings are being applied to the same label. But the difference between the two is so vast that it destroys the purpose of the label.\n\nFrom what I can tell, this sub uses the first definition. If you've used AI at any point of your process, you must label your post \"vibe coded\" or else the mods will remove it.\n\nIt is a shame, because in 2026 there is no serious software work being done without the assistance of AI somewhere in the process.\n\nIt also concerns me how many people seem to base their opinion on AI code from their experience with free-tier chatgpt from 2 years ago. The tools have only gotten better, and using chatgpt to code is not how it's done in the industry today. Plus folks have learned to use the AI tools better.\n\nThere is a large influx of slop in this sub (and the internet as a whole). But I think folks are directing their energy in the wrong direction. It isn't AI code that is problematic, it is the quality of the code. It is the attitudes and behaviors of the authors. These things exist with or without AI, and can be concretely addressed.",

That can happen regardless of whether a project is vibe coded or not.\n\nIf I like a project but feel it doesn’t meet my security standards, I can modify it myself.\n\nAnyway, I feel that a lot of this hate(not saying that’s your case) comes from developers who feel that what took them years to achieve can now be done by anyone, of course with limitations. It’s the same thing that happened when Midjourney launched. A lot of artists were really pissed, but many of my developer friends and coworkers thought, “Wow, this is amazing.

At best, they'd only be useful for the niche people in my community anyway, and I'd share with them if they asked for it. On top of that, there's just no reason to share it because the community has made it pretty clear they are openly hostile to it.\n\nPersonally, I think that's good! If you don't have a problem using coding agents, then use them to build the stuff you need, and we'll all have highly self-tailored stacks, which seems like a cool concept to me, instead of everyone running the exact same setup.\n\nIf the sub doesn't want to deal with \"slop\" then either ban it outright or put together some sort of standard that can be applied to any AI app that checks for the things everyone seems to be concerned about: maintainability, readability, security, etc. Something like a linter that can evaluate a repo and spit out a minimum score to allow for posting.",

There are a gazillion tools, many OSS to check your code quality and security, and many “AI coders” don’t use them at all. \nJust because you have a tool that allows you to build a house it doesn’t mean you don’t have to give it a proper foundation.",

For some metrics I chose QuestDB a while ago but their community edition doesn't really fit in my infrastructure and I will switch to MariaDB coming spring. Since this is only a hobby and not a job. It still must make sense and not sponsor big tech. Mistakes were made and I will need to fix this.\n\nSince Big Tech is now ruining things everywhere and I run this to maintain my own infrastructure, I really want to depend mostly on real Free(dom) Software not Open Source software with some community edition and masking as a corporate freemium stuff.

There's a lot of inexperience as a result and often projects come with certain mindsets / processes that don't jive as well for OSS community.\n\nI do acknowledge AI assistance can be a powerful tool to compliment development when done right though, and that it shouldn't be frowned upon in that case.\n\nHowever I have also been on the receiving end as a maintainer, receiving bug reports and pull requests that are heavily reliant upon AI tools. Some users don't have the technical aptitude to engage in troubleshooting or discussing technical details of their contribution when I ask questions that they use an LLM to respond (and if you know the quirks and patterns those can have, it can be quite frustrating to engage with).\n\nI've seen massive PRs with a single commit that do a bunch of changes that aren't relevant or make any sense. Sometimes they don't even compile. The very least the contributor could do is disclose AI usage.\n\nSuper annoying to get a bug report when their AI assist of choice fails them that shows the user didn't bother to go over the documentation I spent significant time polishing, or search past issues that match their problem with a solution from me there already. Some even get offended when I complain they didn't disclose usage and that it's disrespectful they've been wasting my time when the problem is caused by their laziness (even if they spent hours with an LLM and are frustrated themselves).\n\nI do agree with you that on the bright side it does empower productivity and the ability to flesh out projects that can have capabilities that is lacking elsewhere. That aspect is pretty cool, and for personal use I think that's fine.\n\n`mise-en-place` is a good example of one such project that's very popular and heavily reliant on LLM-driven development. It's not particularly friendly for the OSS community to engage with IMO though and while it's feature set is desirable, it's also got a variety of questionable practices that makes it difficult to trust or rely on in the long term vs the experience with a handcrafted project (unfortunately those lack the developer bandwidth to progress as quickly, time is also taken in reviews or other aspects related to development for quality that can more easily be dismissed by someone using agents).\n\nFwiw I haven't downvoted you btw.",

It's bad enough forking a project prior to vibe coding and having to get familiar with a large foreign code base or dealing with projects like the kind you could inherit and need to support at a job where it was written a long time ago with various issues that it would be nicer to just rewrite/port (I maintain a project that was built upon many large bash scripts and various quality of community contributions over years, tonnes of cleanup and bug fixing).\n\nI've seen quite a few vibe coded projects source and it's a big ick 😅 (it's only deemed acceptable by vibe coders since they don't have to care so much, so long as they can delegate to tooling to offload that burden)",

There has been more good than bad from the bloom. \n\nNow apply this to AI software, user also have to elevate their skills, meaning you have read the codebase before using any app.\n\nDon’t excuse yourself from understanding code. We are in similar time where driving car is a norm since horse era. All people now have the skill to drive.\n\nSame for code, you may not be able to create code (car). But you must understand code (by actually reading it)",

      "text": "The recent influx of AI has lowered the barrier to entry to create your own projects. This development in itself is very interesting and we're curious to see how it'll change our world of SelfHosting in the future. \n\nThe negative side of this however is the influx of AI generated posts, vibe-coded projects over a weekend and many others. Normally, the community votes with its voice. But with the high amount of posts flooding in every day, we've noticed a more negative and sometimes even hostile attitude towards these kinds of projects. \n\nThe stance of the SelfHosted moderation team is that the main focus of this sub should be on services that can be selfhosted and their related topics. For example, but not limited to: alternatives to popular services, taking back control over your data and privacy, containerization, networking, security, etc.\n\nIn order to bring back the focus on these main points of SelfHosting, we're introducing \"Vibe code Friday\". This means that anything AI-assisted or vibe-coded in relation to SelfHosting can be posted only on Fridays from here on out. \nThroughout the week, any app or project that falls within the category will be removed. Repeat-offenders will be timed out from posting. \n\nThis is to reduce the flood of these personal projects being posted all the time. And hopefully bring back the focus to more mature projects within the community. \n\nIn order to determine the difference (as going by code & commits alone can be a great indicator but by itself does not make a great case for what constitutes a vibe-coded or AI-assisted project) we've set the following guidelines:\n- Any project younger than a month old\n- With only one real collaborator (known AI persona's do not count, or are an even better indicator)\n- With obvious signs of vibe-coding*\nWill only be allowed on Vibe-code Fridays. \n\nWe'll run this as a trial for at least a month.\n\nSincerely, /r/SelfHosted mod team.",

Any form of concern or criticism is met with \"but everyone uses AI now, get with the times\" and then further devolves into unproductive, repetitive arguments.\n\nYes, we know AI is prevalent in 2026. We just want to know _how_ you used it an honest, documented, open manner. It's really not a difficult question to answer.\n\nI think not only are the projects themselves piles of slop, but it just brings down the whole mood here when a good chunk of posts end up repeating the AI debate over and over. I sincerely hope this new initiative from the mods goes well, I wish you all the best o7 I think this is definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nAlso a sidenote: another thing that irks me is when \"disclosure\" is just one sentence at the top which is a variation of \"I used ___ AI to do a bunch of stuff, but I also used my 30+ year experience in IT and network security to vet the code and make sure it's good 👍🚀\" and then nothing else at all.

Not only is it unethical to take credit for someone else's work, but there are still many people trying to decide how they feel about AI in general, so letting people know about its usage should be a baseline.",

I myself wrote quite a few and stopped maintaining them because of time constraints or other reasons. \n\nAnd this is actually where AI can help, by reducing the time investment needed for many tasks it makes it easier to maintain such projects by solo devs or smaller numbers of collaborators.\n\nThat is, of course, not to support pure vibe coding, I am talking more about AI assisted development.\n\nThe definition and the line here is fuzzy though, because AI assisted is a very broad term and technically we've had ML based autocomplete for years. I understand the focus is on particularly LLM based things, but even here, as adoptions grows, the line between a good project and bad project will depend less and less on whether it was written by with assistance of AI or not.\n\nI think AI should be treated as a tool, not as a definitive determining quality factor of a project. That said, current criteria look fair, but I think everyone should understand that it blanket-covers basically any solo project. \n\nI think more indicators and criteria are needed to find a better line between \"sloppy work\" and \"good project written with assistance of AI\". For example, there were a lot of cool self hosted projects coming from university students. They are made by solo devs with no online track record, but theu are innovative and well written. As ofnright now they would fall under the definition.\n\nBut I am glad that the choice was made to funnel it all into fridays, instead of completely banning it. I think its still fair and in time we'll all be able to refine criteria and rules and everything.",

The argument against is that it makes it REALLY hard for someone trying to share their idea or project to get it across in that small period of time, which leads to gamification (i.e. posting first to get upvotes).\n\nThe argument for individual threads is that it's more like a regular sub experience, but it could certainly lead to a messier situation. Also, just because you limit the submission to Friday doesn't mean the conversation stops there, so it could be a bit hard to monitor. Maybe if you go this route, at least some flair identifying it as either \"AI-Assisted\" or \"Friday Vibe-Coding\" could be useful?\n\nUltimately, just be transparent that it's an experiment, that the community can see how it goes for a while, and adjust based on feedback.\n\n*EDIT*: It also might be nice to have some guidelines for people posting AI-coded projects. For example, best-practices might include being transparent about the AI-assisted nature of the project, making sure to add info to any README about being careful about hosting it outside a private/protected network, if the project is intended to be maintained or more of a one-off, etc. Most of these are reasonable concerns that people have about AI-assisted projects, so just helping people to be clear about their projects and intentions might help everyone out as well.",

In my never ending search for things-that-work, I come across so many abandoned projects that could hit the sweet spot but have something not quite right about them and they've since been abandoned. Not saying they're AI generated, but more that it would be unpleasant if some of us deployed something AI written and then the person who released it just vanishes when there's issues. There's also the security viewpoint of are they combing over the code the AI generated carefully enough to make sure there's no chances of data breaching or leaking.. \n\nOn the other hand, as an ex-DJ who saw the migration from vinyl records to CDs to digital djing, there was alot of vinyl DJs that looked down at CD DJs, and then alot of CD DJs that looked down at digital DJs and so on. New technology came around, the older crew would die on their hill of the older media and others adapted. I played on all 3 media, it never bothered me, buuuuut it did (as the mods said) lower the entry point for people to start DJing which in turn lowered the value and quality of DJs in the industry.. Those who adapted continued to play but just specialised more on their art, those who didn't adapt continued to play too, just a bit less often so they moved to other roles in the industry (like promoters or marketing or management rolesbat venues).",

For any code authorship, developers can (and should) validate the output completely.  It's now a standard tool to use in professional development.\n\nAre you making the requirement too broad by including any AI assistance in your partial ban?

Any engineer these days not using AI assistance is at an enormous disadvantage. \n\nI think there is a huge misunderstanding in this sub (and most of the internet in general) about what AI usage looks like for an experienced engineer. Even certain boilerplate tasks make sense to be ‘handed off’ to AI as just a prompt. \n\nAnyway my point is, I think this is only going to lead towards more divisiveness, more AI witch hunts, and less collaboration, communication and community building.\n\nI read all of the responses about looking more for ‘maturity’ and if that’s the case then you need to reword the rules you’ve laid out here. Having ‘new project Fridays’ is way more inclusive than ‘AI Slop Fridays’. This line in the sand is wiggly and unclear and it’s going to hurt the community until it is more clearly defined.",

However, as a developer, I find this decision and the distaste for people using AI to help them develop their projects disappointing. We have to learn how to use these tools to the be able to survive in our industry, and using AI tools in our spare time is the best way to get that practice. I have gone from a bunch of half-baked ideas to being able to create projects that I'd be willing to ship with a bit more time. I don't have the luxury of lots of spare time either, and I would rather finish things that just dream about them. Can absolutely can develop quality code with tools like Claude Code with the right approaches and not \"Build me a clone of X\".\n\nThe \"any project that has existed for less than a month\" is arbitrary, but reasonable. That's enough time for someone putting decent effort into a project to make sure the code isn't half-baked. The other two I can't agree with it. There's a lot of developers who enjoy working alone on projects because its our chance to do something our way. There are plenty of projects that have solo maintainers at the start before they grow a community.\n\nI leave my \"coded with Claude Code\" and Claude contributor enabled for transparency, but it's also been in a number of places, including here, a judgement against people and their projects. Again, as a developer, I find that very discouraging and disappointing. I probably put more thought and work into my code now than I ever have. Now, I just spend more time planning and creating specifications than I do writing code. But getting noses turned up at you in the industry and out in communities is frustrating.\n\nI promise you, what people call \"AI slop\" has existed for far longer than a year or so. Where do you think AIs learned to write code like that? Existing code. There have been open source projects for decades now. Before now, did you go look and people's repositories and review their code before you used it? I'm sure the answer is that there are a number of people who both do and don't. What I used to like about open source software was that it was a way to say \"check out this cool thing I did!\". People would try it out and then make their judgement calls about whether it was good enough. And there's a decent number of free applications with questionably quality code, but people use it because it's free and it works. So where's the line?\n\nI know the intent is to keep the quality of projects shared here high, but what I read between the lines and see in comments is \"if you use AI to help you code your project, it probably sucks\". I can't change people's sentiments, and the rules of this community are certainly out of my control. However, it also feels like inclusive and makes this less of a place I would like to visit.",

With this we still give people the opportunity to float their ideas and test the waters. If they gain any traction here in that time, some commitment they'll easily grow out of the one month limitation and maybe even gain a few people willing to collaborate. \n\nOf course, this is our hope.

Then, they share it.  This is where it goes wrong with a community.  They're not sure how to describe it accurately and sell their project in a way that isn't accurate.  The community isn't used to the volume. They call it a flood.   And, it's a natural thing in Programming when new tools were made that made it more accessible.   Remember Visual Basic?  It made programming more accessible to many people, and, there were many projects with it, and everyone looked down on it because the programmers were inexperienced. \n\nPeople don't like it.  They say..  it's maintainability, it's security,   it's clanker...  And, in some of them, that's true.  In others, it's just 'the neighbor stole my lawnmower' excuse (for those who don't know the story, the moral is that humans tend to make up an excuse for when they don't like something, even if they don't know, or won't articulate the reason that they don't like the thing.)\n\nThanks for trying something, and, you're right to think of this as a trial.

I am currently experiencing a critical administrative issue with our official Docker Hub account `bentopdf`\n\nDue to an error during an organization migration, we have temporarily lost control of the `bentopdf` namespace on Docker Hub. **The** `bentopdf` **username/namespace may currently be in a released state, meaning it could potentially be registered by a third party.**  \n  \n**DO NOT** perform a `docker pull bentopdf/...` command at this time.  \n**DO NOT** update your existing containers to `latest`.  \n**If you use BentoPDF in CI/CD pipelines:** Pause your builds or ensure you are using a locally cached version of the image.  \n**If you must deploy:** Please verify that you are using a specific, previously known SHA256 digest that you have already pulled successfully in the past.\n\nI am extremely sorry first of all. While attempting to convert the bentopdf account to an Organization to be verified as a Docker publisher, I renamed the admin to \"alam\"(my name), which I thought would be the new username. I didn't realize that to migrate you need another Docker ID, and this particular docker ID belongs to someone else. We currently do not have access to the \"alam\" account, and the original bentopdf handle is no longer associated with our verified email.\n\nI have already escalated this to Docker Hub Security and Support with \"High Priority\" status to revert the changes and secure the namespace, but they have replied they can't do so. I am in conversation with them to restore our account.\n\nI will update this thread immediately once we have regained control and verified the integrity of the images.\n\nUntil further notice, please consider the Docker Hub `bentopdf` namespace as UNVERIFIED.  \n  \nI am once again very sorry for my negligence and if someone can help me out on this I would be grateful. Thank you.\n\nEDIT: It seems that the new user was last active 5 years ago and hasn't had any activity since. But it's still better to take the necessary precautions \n",

But they didn't ask for any verification so i thought it's just a new username. \n\nNow this particular ID \"alam\" belongs to a third person, which I've no access to and now they have access to our bentopdf Docker image. \n\nNothing suspicious has been done but I believe it's my responsibility to let everyone know until this is resolved and we get back the account.",

      "text": "I've been selfhosting for close to 10 years now. Even longer if you count running a Minecraft server on my PC using Hamachi to share it with friends. I made a lot of mistakes that I want to share to hopefully prevent people from making them as well. Here they are, in no particular order.\n\n# Backups\n\nI had to re-do my whole setup multiple times simply because I was too lazy to do backups. Of course, the 3-2-1 strategy is recommended, but you don't have to do it right from the start. Even storing a copy of the important data on an external hard drive is better than nothing\n\n# Containers or even VMs over bare-metal\n\nThe first server I had was pretty much just an FTP server with a simple php script to do directory listing. For that purpose, running bare metal was more than enough.\n\nThen I started exploring what's possible and wanted to install some actual apps. Nextcloud, Jellyfin, git server, things like that. And boy, was that quickly becoming a nightmare of dependencies, systemd units, and weird \"one off\" commands I had to run every time the server restarted.\n\nEnter Docker. More specifically, Docker Compose. Now I just have a bunch of yaml files that I can push to the server and have Docker take care of running everything, without needing to spend hours on solving missing dependencies and port conflicts\n\n# Infrastructure As Code\n\nBuilding on the previous point, IaC really made managing the server much easier. There are many tools for that, like Ansible or Terraform, but you don't need them.\n\nEven if it's just some `docker-compose.yaml` files and a script that runs `docker compose up -d` over SSH helps immensely. It takes some discipline to not do \"one off\" quickfixes on the server, or at least to sync them up with the IaC.\n\nFor a while I used a Gitlab repo with a pipeline that ran scripts on the server when things changed. That worked surprisingly well, but had the downside of being tied to a specific cloud product. I'm now on Ansible, and TBH I'm only staying with it cause I spent a lot of time setting it up and it's working for me now.\n\n# My OS of choice\n\nOn my desktop, I run Arch btw. It's really good for that use case. It also can be ran on a server, so I gave it a chance. After all, what could go wrong, since I'm only using the OS to run Docker...\n\nZFS. And Wireguard. And constant updates... In short, the updates can cause some things to be just slightly incompatible enough to cause things to break. I've had multiple cases of ZFS kernel module not loading, causing the storage pool to not mount, all the apps failing, and everything dying.\n\nIn short: if you're just running Docker, ZFS and Wireguard, just use Debian, don't be an idiot like me.\n\n# You won't get targeted by hackers; you will get auto-attacked by hundreds of bots every day\n\nHackers are very unlikely to target you specifically. And why would they, there's plenty of better targets for them.\n\nWhat will keep attacking you are the automated bots and port scanners. Nothing unusual, that's just a thing that happens when you're open to the internet.\n\nHowever, you should make sure you're protected. Don't let SSH auth with password, close down ports you don't need, keep everything updated, that sort of things. There are guides about all that, look them up.\n\n# Server at home is nice, but a VPS or a rented root server is just as valid\n\nSo many people here will say that you're not \"actually\" selfhosting if you don't have the server physically in your basement. Fuck every single person who says that.\n\nIt's really fun to own your hardware, it's a one-time investment with upgrades that aren't that expensive. And it also means you can get even a 10Gb/s connection to your server from your computers if you really want.\n\nBut it has several downsides. Noise, power consumption, space, _the price_. Don't let yourself be convinced that those are always worth it, because they're not. I wasted a lot of money on replacement fans cause my server is just too loud.\n\n# 99.999999999% of people won't care\n\nExpect to be the only user of your shit. Maybe with Jellyfin you'd have some people using that, but don't expect to have any users. And if you do - expect to receive complaints whenever things are broken",

Trust me, things can easily go very bad very fast anyway. It may not have happened to you yet, it may never happen to you, but when it happens you will appreciate that offsite backup. \n\nIf your house burns down, and you don’t have a backup, everything is gone regardless of the level of local backups. Same with flooding, earthquakes, accidents, coronal mass ejections.\n\nYour offsite backup shouldn’t be your first restore target, local backups and snapshots are great for that. The remote is disaster recovery.\n\nOh, and test those backups regularly. An untested backup is nothing but a hope. \n\nI’ve personally experienced not being able to restore a backup that was on a remote NAS running RAID1. Everything was fine, backup validated 20% daily, no errors anywhere, until it came time to restore, then nothing worked. I fortunately had other backups so no data was lost.",

Backups and virtualization really should be the first things everyone should learn when initially getting into self hosting. \n\nI highly recommend anyone starting out to just get started with Proxmox. It’s very well documented, easy to install, and the built in backup service is great for beginners. LXCs let you have lightweight VMs for most anything you want to run with easy snapshots to roll back to if you bork something. ZFS is built in making shared storage across your virtual systems a breeze.\n\nFor slightly more advanced users setting up PBS on mediocre hardware (or even an LXC on your host) lets you create off site backups, or at the very least, a backup separate from your main host. It has deduplication built in and can be paired to any other Proxmox host letting you easily restore backed up LXCs to any host. For real world example of this, I had PBS running on an old celeron NAS and ended up borking my main Proxmox host’s install by doing dumb zfs things. I wiped the install drive, booted to the Proxmox install iso, paired up PBS, and had all of my services up and running within 20 minutes. The main benefit is keeping the host install of Proxmox clean. The only thing I run on it is NUT for my UPS, so after a fresh install of the hypervisor, I reinstall NUT, copy over the configs, and it’s all set. \n\nI’ve only been doing this hobby for a few years now. I started with a pi4 running docker compose for some services. But switching to proxmox has made my life so much easier. WARNING: you may end up making your life more complicated once you realize how much potential Proxmox has though 😉",

[Blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky)  \nDNS Proxy - alternative to Pihole, Adguard Home, ... Can be fully configured using a yaml file which is great for automated deployments.\n\n2. [Davis](https://github.com/tchapi/davis)  \nDAV server based on sabre/dav. It supports LDAP as an authentication backend, so it pairs great with something like LLDAP.  \nI use it as a backend for the great [tasks.org](http://tasks.org) app.\n\n3. [Gatus](https://github.com/TwiN/gatus)  \nUptime-Monitoring. While not super unknown, i feel like it doesn't get nearly as much attention as Uptime Kuma. Can be fully configured using a config file which is (again) great for automated deployments/GitOps, ... I also found the main developer to be very nice and responsive.\n\n4. [Papra](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra)  \nDocument management system. Paperless is one of my most used services and has more functionality than i'll probably ever need.  \nI recently started testing Papra as a more lightweight and minimalistic alternative and i like it a lot so far.\n\nWhat are your favorite lesser known services that don't get mentioned on here often enough?\n\n",

Usually I’m at the two task views and plan out the next few weeks, but when I have a larger task (aka project) I go up to the rough timeline and see where it can go and if I have to shuffle anything around. Then when a projects coming up, I create children tasks in the task view as per the usual task flow. \n\nIt was kind of strange to me how basically no software besides Notion let me do this simply, in one unified timeline. The flow seems so natural: “when can I do this big thing?” (project timeline); “ok, when it’s time to do it, what’s the actual work?” (task timeline); “ok, what’s next?” (task kanban). \n\nAnyway, all of that’s just a long way of saying +1 to OpenProject even though I don’t use it due to Notion accidentally allowing something perfectly tailor made for me haha",

A common theme among these is that most of them are just web apps without any storage required - you are just shipping the app to them.\n\n- **lyqht/mini-qr** - This one is a multitool for QR codes - generating and reading. It has lots of features and\n- **withoutbg/app** - Somebody posted it a while ago - it removes backgrounds with AI. That's it. Does a decent job. Stops friends and relatives from using predatory services. **I'm looking for an upscaler and an image expander app as well! Suggestions, please!**\n- **bentopdf/bentopdf** - PDF toolbox. Almost everything you need for PDF editing. I use it interchangeably with striling-pdf but striling have gone a bit intrusive so I recommend bento.\n- **vert-sh/vert** - Universal converter. Converts stuff in a pinch. I actually recommend Tichau/FileConverter which is a windows program (not selfhosted) because it's brilliantly executed. But I use this when on another computer.\n- **iib0011/omni-tools** - a toolbox of stuff. Works well. Jack of all trades but master of none. Still, worth having.\n\nThese aren't public but I use them all the time.\n\n- **chartdb/chartdb** - Visualizes databases. Very helpful if you need to work with databases. I file it under exploratory.\n- **sqlpad/sqlpad** - Web-based SQL editor. I use it daily to run database queries. Just noticed it's been archived which saddens me. A really really handy app.\n- **sharevb/it-tools** - A lot of IT tools that have changed management over the years. It's a huge toolbox with a lot of stuff that 90% of people will never use but it has saved the day several times.\n- **gchq/cyberchef** - More tools for data transformation. Really handy if you aren't sure what you are dealing with and don't want to write a bunch of sacrificial python code to sift through it. Again, filed under exploratory.\n- **lissy93/networking-toolbox** - Lots of networking tools. The few that I used were helpful. Worth having around.\n- **sigoden/dufs** - A very lightweight file server with very simple Web UI AND file serving. You just copy the link to the file and it's served to you raw. I often use it to serve .css files, .js files, scripts. It's just a no-frills solution to multiple problems.\n- **rr-/szurubooru** - This might be weird. It's an image board that has ties to anime/hentai, etc. I use it for SFW stuff, in fact, for work stuff. With the NSFW features stripped. Someone suggested this unorthodox approach a while ago and it turns out, it's an amazing image board with a really nice API that makes automated uploads a breeze. The tagging and categorization engine is what pulled me in initially. IMO, the best approach ever.\n\nThere are also a couple of games I host for friends:\n\n- **massivedecks/server and client** - It's a Cards against Humanity clone. Works well. \n- **biosmarcel/scribble.rs** - Pictionary game. It's very responsive. It's a lot of fun too.\n\n#### If anyone has other nifty little apps that are worth sharing, please do so! I fucking hate the online tools that offer something you desperately need but do a piss-poor job and demand payment/private info.",

Your Oura Ring still syncs raw data through their official app first.\n\n2. Unfortunately, Oura API access requires active subscription (\\~$6/month) - without Membership, only basic daily scores are available (no detailed metrics, history, or **API access**).\n\nRight now we're focusing on direct API integrations, but we don't rule out adding direct device integrations in the future (tbh haven't analysed Oura Ring feasibility yet).",

Both thingino/birdnet-go in general, along with their combination. \n\nBiggest annoyance is unstable RTSP streams when trying to record the realtime video stream via an ffmpeg service running on another device. E.g. transiently unstable rtsp streams fucking things up and necessitating restarting my little ffmpeg service...I gave up trying to get it to recognize when the file died and just set a cronjob to kill it and restart 4 times a day lmao. It'd probably be easier on a more normal systemd machine, but I want it to be running on my gentoo box just because of storage and how I have stuff laid out...and I want my gentoo box to continue running openrc because I specifically use it to stay on my toes for personal/professional development haha.\n\nKinda a pain in the ass but not surprising, given the cheap hardware and the fact that it's over my local wifi network using dated unifi APs. If you're not trying to hammer it with video streams and motion/sound detection and the whole rigmarole, you probably won't have any issues tbh.",

I use it when I don't want to see ads for the next few weeks for things that I've searched for. The ISP/VPN company can't see what I'm accessing, and the site I'm accessing can't see my browser/IP. By running the Webtunnel Bridge from my IP, my Tor traffic blends in with thousands of others who also use it. I do see connections to the bridge from countries where censorship is common, so it's nice to know it is getting used.\n\nThe bridge is different from an [exit node](https://community.torproject.org/relay/types-of-relays/).

I used to work at meta and internally we had a tool called bunnylol which serves as kind of a command line for your browser url bar. You configure it as your browsers default search engine. Then setup a bunch of shortcuts and commands. Then you can use your url bar to quickly redirect to your fav sites like “r <subreddit name>” would go to reddit “r” by utself goes to the home page, “g <search term>” for google, etc. your browser already supports some amount of this but bunny gives you way more flexibility. This may not seem like a big deal but i cant really work without it anymore. \n\nThere are quite a few implementations on github but this one is the most complete imo https://github.com/jrodal98/brunnylol",

They _surely_ will look in places you never would’ve thought to file that document.\n\nThe benefit of tags is that you can apply all of those terms to the same document, so it’ll be found regardless.\nMost people are bad at naming folders.

          "text": "I had actually tried setting up Koito when you first released it. I had set it up and it was working fine (except the lastfm or maloja imports). The problem that time I faced was that I had been using Maloja + Multiscrobbler + Plex for a very long time. So, I had exported my all time music streaming history from Spotify, Apple Music and Last FM and imported all of that to maloja after lot data preprocessing. So, I did the same with Koito and it didn't process all the imports properly. Same happened with trying to import maloja export.\n\nNow, the tracks which were imported from Spotify, I had no problem importing Spotify history with the number of minutes into Koito. But, for Apple Music I edited the export file to make it look like lastfm import, so it didn't have the minutes information. Same went for last fm import which didn't have any minutes information. So, when these two histories were imported as lastfm import, my import history got completely messed up, where Koito was not fetching anything for the lastfm imports. It was simply showing the artist name and track name in the dashboard (no images and in the logs it kept throwing some error) (I had just tried with a small batch of about 3k songs for the import).\n\nI am planning on trying it out again (this time fresh setup as well), but I had few of questions:\n\n* if I scrobble to Koito directly from say lastfm, how does koito fetch the number of minutes played for each track as lastfm doesn't store that info. Does it fetch the track length from any provider and use it as number of minutes played? If yes, then what happens if Koito is not able to find a particular track in any provider?\n* Also, does Koito by any chance support associations like Maloja does? For example, If I am listening to TWICE and I also separately listen to NAYEON, TZUYU OR MISAMO, Maloja gives me an option to view all these separate artists stats as one under TWICE as an association as they are all members of TWICE.\n* Currently, I moved to Navidrome permanently, so If I setup navidrome with Koito (like you have mentioned in the docs), for a track to be considered as a scrobble, what is the threshold? Does it get scrobbled when 50% of the track is played, or do I need to play the full song for it to get scrobbled to Koito?",

              "text": "Since I first posted about the project I've made improvements to importing, so your imports should hopefully work much better now, especially if you setup the connection with Navidrome before importing so that Koito can just grab the images from Navidrome. Duration information is now fetched and backfilled if Lastfm imports include a MusicBrainz Recording ID as well, so hopefully that will help with some of the problems. One thing that hasn't changed is that Maloja imports still will have no duration information at all, so time played still won't count for any new tracks imported with Maloja.\n\nFor your questions:\n\n- Lastfm doesn't store durations, but does sometimes store MusicBrainz Recording IDs, which Koito will use to get duration info. If an ID isn't provided, Koito will fill in the duration when it receives a listen of the song from Navidrome.\n- I've never used this feature in Maloja, so I don't really know how it works. Koito will just present the artists as they are listed in the track information, so if a song features an artist by name, it will count as a listen for that artist (look at Uncomfortably Numb by American Football ft. Hayley Williams in my public demo to see what I mean).\n- Koito does not determine that threshold at all, it is determined by your music player. For example, I use Feishin with Navidrome, and it has options in the settings to decide when to scrobble the listen back to your music server. I think the default is 4 minutes or 85% of the duration, whichever is sooner.\n\nHope that helps!",

You can even point your music server to Koito, then configure Koito to relay to Maloja so you don't have to give one of them up (I used to do this during Koito's initial development).",

It's incredible what these machines can do.\n\nMy company is ISO 27001 and SOC 2 compliant, so getting the details right to be able to launch this was a bit of a project.\n\nI'm happy to share more and answer any questions folks may have.

Need to do this. In the meantime, the tl;dr is you set up all transcription requests to go into a queue. Then you set up the Macs to read requests from the queue, perform the transcription work, and save the results. Then you set up an autoscaler in AWS to monitor the number of messages waiting in the queue. You can have the number of cloud instances idle low (or zero), so then if the Mac cluster were to go offline, the autoscaler fans out and the cloud takes over.   \n  \nSo this way you still have the resiliency of being in the cloud, but the spend only kicks in if your on-prem cluster goes offline.",

Stuff disappearing, recommendations getting worse, the app turning into a podcast and AI promo machine instead of a music player.\n\nAround a year ago I started reading about Linux. Not installing yet, just reading. I knew I didn’t want to rush it and end up frustrated, so I took my time trying to actually understand how things work.\n\nAt the same time, Windows was starting to feel… weird. AI features everywhere, things changing without asking, more stuff running in the background than I was comfortable with. My computer stopped feeling like a tool and started feeling like a service I didn’t sign up for.\n\nEventually I made the jump.\n\nI’m on Debian now, keeping it simple and stable. Free software only where possible. I also went all in and Librebooted my hardware, which honestly felt great. No opaque BIOS junk, no mystery firmware before the OS loads. It’s boring in the best way.\n\nThe big win for me was music.\n\nI set up Navidrome and pointed it at about 2 TB of music I’ve collected over the years. My files, properly tagged, lyrics embedded, no ads, no algorithms. It just works. I can stream from any device, anywhere, and it feels like having my own private Spotify but without the nonsense.\n\nThis wasn’t a weekend project. I moved slowly, learned the basics, figured out backups and networking first. I wanted something that would still work a year from now without babysitting.\n\nOnce that was running, something clicked. If I can host my own music this easily, why am I outsourcing so much of my digital life?\n\nI’m not trying to be hardcore or preachy about it. This just feels calmer. More in my control.\n\nCurious if anyone else here dropped streaming services or Windows and ended up down the self-hosting rabbit hole too.",

Also buying albums gets very expensive in the long run. I like that I can try some artists on Spotify before I commit and buy their albums on vinyl (usually get a digital download with this too). I also know that’s artists get some money from Spotify as opposed to some users here who “acquire” music from other sources",

Music piracy was ubiquitous throughout society.\n\nMy point being: The cost of music was inevitably going down to near zero. Whether other services are more fair in what they pay is another question, but record labels have also been predatory before the internet. This isn’t some new phenomenon and it is not like listeners have really been informed on how big the cut of a CD they bought was anyway.\n\nSo while I commend you on how you manage your music, the majority of consumers have never been concerned with the topic of fair distribution. From their pov, streaming is good and cheap enough to not start pirating again.\n\nAnd as far as AI content is concerned: I keep reading that argument but I don’t even see anything when I use Spotify myself. There may be some bullshit recommendations on the start page, but mostly it is stuff fitting to what I listen to, or I just stick to my own playlists anyway. And I have never encountered an AI song in automatically appended songs, which can be deactivated anyway\n\nSo I just don’t really get those arguments. They seem to be blown out of proportion.",

I wonder if that was a result of an \"algorithm\" that was being fed contextual data about you from outside the context of spotify that led it to think that was what your preferences were... or if they were simply pumping in more features/content and the volume of new content got pushed onto users intentionally/inadvertently? My question to you, however, is whether you found this offensive because it broke your expectations of how you use/used spotify (ie. I curate spotify heavily, I use spotify to loosely generate playlists for me, I just want noise in the background that matches my preferences, I have certainly general daily routines and will try to seek music that matches my expected energy/mood). I'm just curious because I'm working on an personal project that is kinda trying to address that - at least from my perspective, so getting feedback from someone else is helpful if you don't mind. Especially when you are being so public about it 😂 and, I am a solo dev, not a marketer or whatever person doing market research rest assured fyi.",

I ran some optimization for the over clocking, tried multiple different configs and windows still was acting weird. Shortly after I thought I had the issue resolved, windows  decided it need to ping everything all the time all at once and started sending a dns request every half second or more... and then caused the threads assigned to the pi-hole to overheat and the machine to crash. \n\nI ended up setting up a raspberry pi and a old laptop both with pihole and a docker container to sync them so my wife could have some peace. The raspberry pi is phenomenal. Super stable, very low power draw. \n\n.... she still side eyes me every time google thinks to long.",

      "text": "While working on my own KVM setup, it slowly dawned on me how awkward it is that we still treat BIOS as video. Most firmware screens are clearly text-based, yet we compress and push pixels around just to change a boot option or read an error message. The more I worked on it, the more that approach started to feel fundamentally wrong.\n\nIn an ideal world, everything would have a proper BMC. In practice, a lot of homelab gear - especially small servers, NUCs, and various Chinese or whitebox boards - simply doesn’t. And even when BMC is available, it’s not always something I want to depend on for last-resort recovery.\n\nSo I ended up building a small, dedicated hardware device for headless maintenance that I now keep in the rack as a “break glass” tool.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fz7s735g8rdg1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f7f8950b28cc29811c8aaa554eac9c58b8a6a8d\n\nThe first part is BIOS-to-Text. The device sits inline on HDMI and, instead of treating the signal as a video stream, it reconstructs what’s on the firmware screen and exposes it as an ANSI text interface over SSH. It’s intentionally focused on firmware and pre-OS environments rather than general-purpose graphics. From a terminal, I can navigate BIOS menus, read POST output, copy error messages, or script pre-OS workflows without dealing with video latency or blind keystrokes.\n\n[The output isn’t a framebuffer. It’s a pure ANSI text stream served over SSH](https://preview.redd.it/zid7f1oj8rdg1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bb5f62b6a06c28cdea735054d8782b262954ccf)\n\nThe second part is recovery. I integrated a local storage layer based on Btrfs that presents itself to the host as a normal USB drive, but internally keeps immutable, read-only snapshots. This is not meant for snapshotting an OS or doing live rollbacks. I use it purely as a resilient container for ISOs, rescue environments, and recovery scripts. Even if the host is compromised or wipes the drive, previous snapshots remain intact and readable, so recovery media doesn’t disappear when you need it most.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wec75zv3crdg1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d90c811d8b5c7b39c177ff05331f44158759c25\n\nThe goal wasn’t to replace existing KVMs or BMCs, but to have a reliable last-resort device that works without agents on the host, without relying on the OS, and without assuming the network or firmware stack is in a healthy state. It’s the thing I reach for when everything else has already failed and I just want my weekend back.\n\nI’ve been documenting the build and experiments as a personal devlog over at r/USBridge if anyone is curious about the internals.",

To be clear: this isn’t trying to turn fully animated GUIs into a terminal movie. The focus is on firmware and pre-OS screens where the interface is still structured and deterministic enough to treat as text.\n\nThankfully, most server and workstation boards keep things fairly utilitarian. For those (and simpler graphical UEFIs), it works reasonably well. But you're right - once you get into heavy animations and eye-candy, that’s outside the scope.\n\nThe goal is reliability and control, not recreating the Star Wars crawl in my terminal 🙂",

Thought this might be useful for others here, even if the conclusion is a bit uncomfortable for a selfhost crowd.\n\nSetup assumptions on my side:\n\n\t•\tAI usage around 4–6 hours a day, mostly interactive\n\n\t•\tStorage needs around 2 TB, but must be accessible 24/7 from anywhere\n\n\t•\tElectricity included properly (idle power + active usage)\n\n\t•\tCost of capital assumed at 17 percent\n\n\t•\tDepreciation over 3 years\n\n\t•\tDisposal value included (GPUs keep value surprisingly wel, if you assume that it will be an upmarket)\n\n\t•\tNo heroic assumptions about free time or zero maintenance\n\nAfter modelling a few common GPU setups and comparing against Google AI Pro, this is what I ended up with on a monthly economic cost basis:\n\nOption\n\nMonthly Cost\n\nGoogle AI Pro\n\n$19.99\n\nRTX 3060\n\n\\~$49\n\nRTX 3090\n\n\\~$67\n\nRTX 4070 Ti Super\n\n\\~$63\n\nRTX A5000 (used)\n\n\\~$69\n\nThis includes hardwar amortization, cost of capital, power (including 24/7 storage uptime), and realistic resale value at the end.\n\nWhat surprised me most is not that self-hosting costs more, but how much Google seems to be eating the cost here. AI Pro is basically giving:\n\n\t•\tFrontier-ish models\n\n\t•\tVery low latency\n\n\t•\tNo maintenance\n\n\t•\t2 TB storage\n\n\t•\tGlobal availability\n\n\t•\tReasonable usage limits (at least for now)\n\nAt $20/month this feels heavily subsidised. Which then brings up the obvious enshittification question. This feels like a classic playbook where pricing is below long-run cost to lock in usage and expectations, and then things tighten later.\n\nFrom a pure selfhost perspective, I still see value if you care about:\n\n\t•\tPrivacy\n\n\t•\tUnlimited usage\n\n\t•\tCustom fine-tuning\n\n\t•\tOffline access\n\nBut for me personally, right now, with my usage level, self-hosting AI does not make economic sense. Even the most efficient GPU setups are roughly 3x the cost of AI Pro once you treat capital properly.\n\nSo for now I’m probably sticking with Google AI Pro and keeping local self-hosting for other services where the economics are clearer. Curious if others have run similar numbers or if I’m missing something obvious here.\n\nWould love to hear counterexamples or cases where this does flip in favour of self-hosting without assuming massive daily usage. Obviously, I know Google has enterprise hardware like their own custom asics or the H200s and economies of scale and stuff... but what obvious points am i missing or it's not just a game not worth doing (from a pure monetary pov) unless you really need it for doing AI related developments and stuff?",

Yes, there's probably some subsidizing going on, but you're one person using it interactively. At scale, they get enough queries that they run it constantly.\n\n\nThe Pro plan is $20 for 100 queries per day. They can run a lot of Pro-level users on one server over the course of the day, so that adds up.\n\n\nBut the deal is even better for them, because of a technical detail: multiple simultaneous queries are basically free. Due to the way GPUs work, they typically have the bandwidth to calculate a bundle of queries all at once, since it's just more multiplication and doing the calculations across one neural network layer simultaneously is ridiculously more efficient than doing it in the layers in sequence. So the efficiency comparison of your individual queries is wasting 20x or more processing power. You can do something similar if you use something like VLLM on your own GPU...but of course, that requires that you actually have that many simultaneous queries. \n\n\nThe real money is in things like coding and agents and batch processing; those subscriptions run you $200+ per month (and still have rate limits) or are billed per-token. You can check Openrouter for a good cross-section of API per-token prices.\n\n\nIf you're just using it interactively as a single user, and the $20 plan works for you, then it's obviously a good deal. If you're automating agents, with many queries every time it does something, the API costs can add up fast.",

Same for infrastructure, electricity etc.\n* You are assuming 4-6 hours/day of use, but Google's hardware runs 24x7.\n* They have all sorts of plans (free, $20, $200, pay as you go) and large enterprise contracts, so the revenue is a lot more varied.\n* The average user isn't using their plan for 6 hours a day.

That being said, these numbers are going to be significantly off, because the models they are running are actually much more expensive to run. GPT 5.2 won't run on any of these cards, I'd be surprised if the frontier models will even run on a single H100, so we're talking $500k servers to run a model effectively. But I'd think they are slightly profitable on inference, because that server can do inference for hundreds of people. I don't know their numbers but the number of active users/ inference servers is probably significantly higher than you think it is.\n\nWhere they are ABSOLUTELY subsidizing is training, The vast majority of the hardware that these companies are buying is running at 100% load constantly, the best estimates that I've seen are that it's a fairly even split between data ingest, training and inference. So the part that you pay for (and can do yourself) makes up about 1/3 of their hardware costs, it's clear that subscriptions are not covering the entire bill but if the numbers are correct of \\~9B in expenses and 4B in revenue big AI companies aren't really subsidizing inference, but they are heavily subsidizing the models.",

So they're availability is actually not _really_ 24/7 depending on various factors and your subscription.\n\n\nAnd, Google also has multiple revenue streams so they aren't subsidizing your use - other users, companies and revenue sources could be subsidizing it.\n\n\nBut you shouldn't try to compete with Google or OpenAI, etc. You won't be able to. Buy the hardware if you are actually interested in local AI.",

      "text": "Boy do I feel silly.  About a year ago, I did a substantial rearchitecture and upgrade of my home services and network configuration.  It touched on everything from running a hetrogenous Docker cluster to how I scanned receipts to automation around lighting.\n\nSo many things needed tweaking that although I noticed about a week later that videos served through Plex were looking kind of grainy, I took a really quick look at the settings, didn't see anything obviously wrong, and chalked it up to \"well, I upgraded both Plex and the Apple TV, there's probably some other setting I need to tweak\".  It went onto my \"todo eventually\" list (so I promptly forgot).  I mainly use Plex for streaming my music to PlexAmp, so video hasn't been a priority for me.  Until I tried to get things set up for my daughter to watch some shows I downloaded for her.  I was like, \"I took extra time to download HQ renditions of this stuff, why does this look like ass?\"  Checked it in VLC, and it looked perfect.   \n  \nThen I looked at Playback settings, and despite the global setting being to \"play original\" locally, once I started the video, it was set to 480p!  I tried checking \"play original\", but it just immediately snapped back to 480p. \n\nSearching this issue led to the suggestion to check the \"Network > Relay\" setting, and to monitor the dashboard while watching and see if it was streaming locally or remotely.  Sure enough, it was remote, and my Relay setting was indeed turned on:  \n  \n*\"The Relay allows connections to the server through a proxy relay when the server is not accessible otherwise. Note: this proxy relay is bandwidth limited.\"*\n\nI disabled the Relay, and then couldn't get to any of my media, which I thought was really weird since the server was local and configured to use the correct IP and port.  Then I remembered...  \n  \nAnother part of my upgrade was to reconfigure the UDM Pro to have a separate \"devices\" VLAN, primarily for IoT devices.  My Apple TV also lives on that network.  My Synology, which hosts the Plex server, lives on the secure VLAN.  My firewall rules explicitly forbid device traffic from hitting the secure network.\n\nIf I had no access to the media from the start, this would have been obvious, but the relay setting hid the mistake from me, and allowed things to seem to \"work\" by streaming everything remotely!\n\nI fixed the firewall rules, but also discovered that Plex still thought that it needed to go remote because of the different networks; Plex lived on 192.168.1.x and the AppleTV was on 192.168.2.x.  So, I also had to change the \"local networks\" setting (to 192.168.0.0/16 in my case).\n\nEverything plays locally again and I'm able to handle HD video from the fairly low-spec Synology fine, although it does seem to struggle a bit adding subtitles.\n\nAnyway, this is a pretty niche misconfiguration, but hopefully it will save someone a few minutes someday.",

This isn't theory - it's battle-tested knowledge that kept our services running through countless deployments.\n\n**What's in V1:**\n- Complete Swarm hierarchy explained\n- VPS requirements and cost planning across providers\n- DNS configuration (the #1 cause of Swarm issues)\n- Production-ready compose files and multi-stage Dockerfiles\n- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack\n- Platform comparison (Portainer, Dokploy, Coolify, CapRover, Dockge)\n- CI/CD versioning and deployment workflows\n- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TheDecipherist/docker-swarm-guide) with all configs\n\n---\n\n## Why Docker Swarm in 2026?\n\nBefore the Kubernetes crowd jumps in - yes, I know K8s exists. But here's the thing: **Docker Swarm is still incredibly relevant in 2026**, especially for small-to-medium teams who want container orchestration without the complexity overhead.\n\nSwarm advantages:\n- Native Docker integration (no YAML hell beyond compose files)\n- Significantly lower learning curve\n- Perfect for 2-20 node clusters\n- Built-in service discovery and load balancing\n- Rolling updates out of the box\n- Works with your existing Docker Compose files (mostly)\n\nIf you're not running thousands of microservices across multiple data centers, Swarm might be exactly what you need.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding the Docker Swarm Hierarchy\n\n```\nSwarm → Nodes → Stacks → Services → Tasks (Containers)\n```\n\n- **Swarm**: Your entire cluster. Only works with **pre-built images** - no `docker build` in production.\n- **Nodes**: Managers (handle state/scheduling) and Workers (run containers). Use 3 or 5 managers for HA.\n- **Stacks**: Groups of related services from a compose file.\n- **Services**: Manage replicas, rolling updates, health monitoring, auto-restart.\n- **Tasks**: A Task = Container. 6 replicas = 6 tasks.\n\n---\n\n## VPS Requirements & Cost Planning\n\nDocker Swarm is lightweight - minimal overhead compared to Kubernetes.\n\n### Infrastructure Presets\n\n| Preset | Nodes | Layout | Min Specs (per node) | Use Case |\n|--------|-------|--------|---------------------|----------|\n| **Minimal** | 1 | 1 manager | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 25GB | Dev/testing only |\n| **Basic** | 2 | 1 manager + 1 worker | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 50GB | Small production |\n| **Standard** | 3 | 1 manager + 2 workers | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB | Standard production |\n| **HA** | 5 | 3 managers + 2 workers | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB | High availability |\n\n### Approximate Monthly Costs (2025/2026)\n\n| Provider | Basic (2 nodes) | Standard (3 nodes) | HA (5 nodes) |\n|----------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| **Hetzner** | ~€8-12 | ~€20-30 | ~€40-60 |\n| **Vultr** | ~$12-20 | ~$30-50 | ~$60-100 |\n| **DigitalOcean** | ~$16-24 | ~$40-60 | ~$80-120 |\n| **Linode** | ~$14-22 | ~$35-55 | ~$70-110 |\n\n**Why these numbers?**\n- **1GB RAM minimum**: Swarm itself uses ~100-200MB, but you need headroom for containers\n- **3 or 5 managers for HA**: Raft consensus requires odd numbers for quorum\n- **2 vCPU for production**: Single core gets bottlenecked during deployments\n\n### My Recommendation\n\nFor most small-to-medium teams:\n1. **Start with Basic (2 nodes)** - 1 manager + 1 worker on Vultr or Hetzner\n2. **Budget ~$20-40/month** for a production-ready setup\n3. **Add nodes as needed** - Swarm makes scaling easy\n\nIf you need HA from day one, the **Standard (3 nodes)** preset gives you redundancy without breaking the bank.\n\n### What About AWS/GCP/Azure?\n\nCloud giants work fine with Swarm, but:\n- **More expensive** for equivalent specs\n- **More complexity** (VPCs, security groups, IAM)\n- **Better if** you need other AWS services (RDS, S3, etc.)\n\nWe run Swarm on AWS EC2 because we're already deep in the AWS ecosystem. If you're starting fresh, a dedicated VPS provider is simpler and cheaper.\n\n---\n\n## Setting Up Your Production Environment\n\n### Install Docker (Ubuntu)\n\n```bash\n# Add Docker's official GPG key and repo\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg\nsudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg\n\necho \"deb [arch=\"$(dpkg --print-architecture)\" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo \"$VERSION_CODENAME\") stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n```\n\n**Important:** Use `docker compose` (space), not `docker-compose` (deprecated).\n\n### Initialize the Swarm\n\n```bash\n# Get your internal IP\nip addr\n\n# Initialize on manager (use YOUR internal IP)\ndocker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.10.1.141:2377 --listen-addr 10.10.1.141:2377\n\n# Join token for workers (save this!)\ndocker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-xxxxx... 10.10.1.141:2377\n```\n\n**Critical:** Use a fixed IP for advertise address. Dynamic IPs will break your cluster on restart.\n\n---\n\n## DNS Configuration (This Will Save You Hours)\n\n**CRITICAL**: DNS issues cause 90% of Swarm networking problems.\n\nEdit `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` on each node:\n\n```ini\n[Resolve]\nDNS=10.10.1.122 8.8.8.8\nDomains=~yourdomain.io\n```\n\nThen reboot. Docker runs its own DNS at `127.0.0.11` for container-to-container resolution.\n\n**Rule:** Never hardcode IPs in Swarm. Use service names - Docker handles routing.\n\n---\n\n## Network Configuration\n\nCreate an overlay network (mandatory for multi-node):\n\n```bash\ndocker network create \\\n  --opt encrypted \\\n  --subnet 172.240.0.0/24 \\\n  --gateway 172.240.0.254 \\\n  --attachable \\\n  --driver overlay \\\n  awsnet\n```\n\n| Flag | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `--opt encrypted` | IPsec encryption. Optional but recommended. **Note:** Can cause issues with NAT - use internal VPC IPs |\n| `--subnet` | Prevents conflicts with VPC ranges |\n| `--attachable` | Allows standalone containers to connect |\n\n### Required Ports\n\n- **TCP 2377**: Cluster management\n- **TCP/UDP 7946**: Node communication\n- **TCP/UDP 4789**: Overlay network traffic\n\n---\n\n## Production Compose File\n\n```yaml\nversion: \"3.8\"\n\nservices:\n  nodeserver:\n    dns:\n      - 10.10.1.122\n    init: true  # Proper signal handling, zombie cleanup\n\n    environment:\n      - NODE_ENV=production\n      - API_KEY=${API_KEY}\n\n    deploy:\n      mode: replicated\n      replicas: 6\n      placement:\n        max_replicas_per_node: 3\n      update_config:\n        parallelism: 2\n        delay: 10s\n        failure_action: rollback\n        order: start-first\n      rollback_config:\n        parallelism: 2\n        delay: 10s\n      restart_policy:\n        condition: on-failure\n        delay: 5s\n        max_attempts: 3\n        window: 120s\n      resources:\n        limits:\n          cpus: '0.50'\n          memory: 400M\n        reservations:\n          cpus: '0.20'\n          memory: 150M\n\n    image: \"yourregistry/nodeserver:latest\"\n    ports:\n      - \"61339\"\n    networks:\n      awsnet:\n    secrets:\n      - app_secrets\n\nsecrets:\n  app_secrets:\n    external: true\n\nnetworks:\n  awsnet:\n    external: true\n```\n\n**Key settings:**\n- `init: true` - Runs tini as PID 1 for proper signal handling\n- `failure_action: rollback` - Auto-rollback on failed deployments\n- `order: start-first` - New containers start before old ones stop (zero downtime)\n- **Always set resource limits** - A runaway container can kill your node\n\n---\n\n## Dockerfile Best Practices\n\n### Multi-Stage Build (Node.js)\n\n```dockerfile\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\nFROM node:20-bookworm-slim AS base\nWORKDIR /app\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3 make g++ && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nCOPY package.json package-lock.json ./\n\nFROM base AS compiled\nRUN npm ci --omit=dev\n\nFROM node:20-bookworm-slim AS final\nRUN ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --from=compiled /app/node_modules /app/node_modules\nCOPY . .\nEXPOSE 3000\nENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"./server.js\"]\n```\n\n**Why multi-stage?** Build tools stay in temp stage. Final image is clean and small.\n\n### Key Rules\n\n1. **Run in foreground** - `CMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]` (official nginx image handles this)\n2. **Pin base images** - `FROM ubuntu:22.04` not `FROM ubuntu:latest`\n3. **Include health checks** - Swarm uses these for rolling updates\n4. **Use .dockerignore** - Exclude `.env`, `node_modules`, `.git`\n\n### Sample .dockerignore\n\n```\n.git\n.gitignore\n.env\n.env.*\nnode_modules\nnpm-debug.log\nDockerfile*\ndocker-compose*\n.dockerignore\n*.md\n.vscode\n.idea\n```\n\nThis keeps your build context small and prevents secrets from accidentally ending up in images.\n\n---\n\n## Monitoring Stack (Prometheus + Grafana)\n\nFull compose file in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TheDecipherist/docker-swarm-guide). Key points:\n\n| Service | Purpose | Mode |\n|---------|---------|------|\n| Grafana | Dashboards | 1 replica on manager |\n| Prometheus | Metrics collection | 1 replica on manager |\n| cAdvisor | Container metrics | Global (all nodes) |\n| Node Exporter | Host metrics | Global (all nodes) |\n\nUse `mode: global` for monitoring agents - runs ONE instance on EVERY node.\n\n**Quick setup tip:** Start with cAdvisor + Node Exporter first. Add Prometheus when you need historical data. Add Grafana when you need pretty dashboards for your team.\n\n---\n\n## Docker Management Platforms\n\nManaging Swarm via CLI is powerful, but GUIs improve visibility significantly.\n\n### Portainer\n\n**Best for:** Teams wanting visual management without changing workflows.\n\n```bash\n# Deploy Portainer agent on each node\ndocker service create --name portainer_agent \\\n  --publish mode=host,target=9001,published=9001 \\\n  --mode global \\\n  --mount type=bind,src=//var/run/docker.sock,dst=/var/run/docker.sock \\\n  --mount type=bind,src=//var/lib/docker/volumes,dst=/var/lib/docker/volumes \\\n  portainer/agent:latest\n\n# Deploy Portainer server on manager\ndocker service create --name portainer \\\n  --publish 9443:9443 --publish 8000:8000 \\\n  --replicas=1 --constraint 'node.role == manager' \\\n  --mount type=volume,src=portainer_data,dst=/data \\\n  portainer/portainer-ce:latest\n```\n\n**Pricing:** CE is completely free with no node limits. Business Edition adds enterprise features.\n\n**Why Portainer?** It shows you container logs, resource usage, network topology, and lets you manage stacks visually. Perfect for teams where not everyone is a CLI wizard.\n\n### Platform Comparison\n\n| Platform | Swarm Support | Git Deploy | Auto SSL | Best For |\n|----------|---------------|------------|----------|----------|\n| **Portainer** | Full | No | No | Visual management |\n| **Dokploy** | Full | Yes | Yes | Heroku-style on Swarm |\n| **Coolify** | Experimental | Yes | Yes | 280+ templates, great UI |\n| **CapRover** | Full (native) | Yes | Yes | Proven Swarm PaaS |\n| **Dockge** | None | No | No | Simple Compose management |\n\n**My setup:** Portainer for visibility + custom CI/CD + Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.\n\n**Note on Coolify:** Their Swarm support is experimental. Works for basic setups but I've hit edge cases. Great project though - watch this space.\n\n---\n\n## Secret Management\n\n**Stop using environment variables for secrets.**\n\n```yaml\nsecrets:\n  app_secrets:\n    external: true  # Created via CLI or Portainer\n\nservices:\n  app:\n    secrets:\n      - app_secrets\n```\n\nCreate secrets:\n```bash\ndocker secret create app_secrets ./secrets.json\n```\n\nSecrets appear as files in `/run/secrets/SECRET_NAME`. They're encrypted at rest, not visible in `docker inspect`, and only sent to nodes that need them.\n\n---\n\n## CI/CD Versioning\n\n```bash\nBUILD_VERSION=$(cat ./buildVersion.txt)\nLONG_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)\n\ndocker compose build --build-arg GIT_COMMIT=$LONG_COMMIT --build-arg BUILD_VERSION=$BUILD_VERSION\ndocker compose push\ndocker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack\n```\n\n**Never use `latest` in production.** Use commit hashes or semantic versions.\n\n**Why versioning matters:**\n- Rollback becomes a one-liner: `docker service update --image yourapp:v1.2.3 mystack_app`\n- You know exactly what's running on each node\n- Audit trails for compliance\n- No more \"but it worked on my machine\" mysteries\n\n---\n\n## Useful Commands\n\n```bash\n# Node management\ndocker node ls                                              # List all nodes\ndocker node update --availability=drain docker2.domain.io   # Maintenance mode\ndocker node update --availability=active docker2.domain.io  # Back to active\ndocker node inspect docker2.domain.io --pretty              # Node details\n\n# Stack operations\ndocker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack   # Deploy/update stack\ndocker stack services mystack                       # List services in stack\ndocker stack ps mystack                             # List tasks (containers)\ndocker stack rm mystack                             # Remove stack\n\n# Service operations\ndocker service scale mystack_web=4                  # Scale to 4 replicas\ndocker service logs -f mystack_web                  # Follow logs\ndocker service logs --tail 100 mystack_web          # Last 100 lines\ndocker service update --force mystack_web           # Force redeploy\ndocker service update --image yourapp:v2 mystack_web  # Update image\n\n# Debugging\ndocker service ps mystack_web --no-trunc            # Full error messages\ndocker inspect $(docker ps -q -f name=mystack_web)  # Container details\n```\n\n**Pro tip:** `docker stack deploy` is idempotent. Run it again to update - no need to `rm` first.\n\n---\n\n## Common Gotchas\n\nThese issues have cost me hours. Learn from my pain.\n\n**Containers can't communicate between nodes:**\n1. Verify overlay network exists: `docker network ls`\n2. Check it's attached to your service in compose file\n3. Verify DNS config in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` on each node\n4. Ensure ports 7946 (TCP/UDP) and 4789 (UDP) are open between nodes\n5. If using `--opt encrypted`, try without it first (NAT issues)\n\n**Service stuck in \"Pending\":**\n```bash\ndocker service ps myservice --no-trunc\n```\nCommon causes:\n- Resource constraints - scheduler can't find a node with enough CPU/memory\n- Image doesn't exist or can't be pulled (check registry auth)\n- Placement constraints can't be satisfied\n- All nodes are drained or paused\n\n**Rolling update hangs:**\nHealth checks are usually the culprit. Your container might be healthy but Swarm doesn't know it.\n\n```yaml\nhealthcheck:\n  test: [\"CMD\", \"curl\", \"-f\", \"http://localhost:3000/health\"]\n  interval: 30s\n  timeout: 10s\n  retries: 3\n  start_period: 60s  # Give your app time to start!\n```\n\n**\"No such network\" errors:**\nCreate networks BEFORE deploying stacks:\n```bash\ndocker network create --driver overlay --attachable mynetwork\ndocker stack deploy -c compose.yml mystack\n```\n\n**Secrets not updating:**\nSecrets are immutable. To update:\n1. Create new secret with different name: `docker secret create app_secrets_v2 ./secrets.json`\n2. Update compose to reference new secret name\n3. Redeploy stack\n\n---\n\n## Final Tips\n\n1. **Use Portainer** - Free and makes Swarm management much easier. Deploy it first.\n2. **Always use external networks** - Create overlay networks before deploying stacks\n3. **Tag images properly** - Never `latest` in production. Use commit hashes or semver.\n4. **Set resource limits** - Always. A runaway container will take down your node.\n5. **Test your rollback** - Deploy a broken image intentionally to verify auto-rollback works\n6. **Monitor from day one** - Prometheus + Grafana is free and catches issues early\n7. **Document your setup** - Future you will thank present you\n8. **Start small** - 2 nodes is enough to learn. Scale when you need it.\n\n---\n\n## Backup Your Swarm State\n\nSwarm state lives on manager nodes. Back it up:\n\n```bash\n# Stop Docker (on manager)\nsudo systemctl stop docker\n\n# Backup the Swarm state\nsudo tar -cvzf swarm-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /var/lib/docker/swarm\n\n# Start Docker\nsudo systemctl start docker\n```\n\nStore backups off-node. If all managers die simultaneously (rare but possible), this is your recovery path.\n\n---\n\n## When NOT to Use Swarm\n\nTo be fair, Swarm isn't always the answer:\n\n- **Need advanced scheduling?** K8s has more sophisticated options\n- **Running 50+ services?** K8s ecosystem is more mature at scale\n- **Need service mesh?** Istio/Linkerd integrate better with K8s\n- **Team already knows K8s?** Stick with what you know\n\nFor everything else - small teams, 2-20 nodes, wanting to move fast - Swarm is hard to beat.\n\n---\n\n## GitHub Repo\n\nAll compose files, Dockerfiles, and configs mentioned in this guide:\n\n**[github.com/TheDecipherist/docker-swarm-guide](https://github.com/TheDecipherist/docker-swarm-guide)**\n\nThe repo includes:\n- Complete monitoring stack compose file\n- Production-ready multi-stage Dockerfiles\n- Network configuration examples\n- Portainer deployment scripts\n\n---\n\n## What's Coming in V2\n\nBased on community feedback, V2 will cover:\n- Deep dive into monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog comparison)\n- Blue-green deployments in Swarm\n- Logging strategies (ELK, Loki, etc.)\n- Traefik integration for automatic SSL\n\n---\n\n*What's your Swarm setup?

We all use what works for us and while some of us may use some the purest of pure solution for one thing, we don't necessarily have to do that for everything we host. We do what works for us. Self host is a spectrum not a binary state. It's meaningful to host your own server and your own media, even if plex is handling authentication.\n\nI think your message would land better for more people if you focused more on Jellyfin's genuine strengths and less on what Plex lacks in your mind.",

One day without my media isn't the worst thing in the world, but the principle of having to call out to a cloud server to verify an account to watch content on another computer in my house seems stupid to me. \n\nOn top of that, I feel like the user experience has gotten worse with Plex over time. My media is now harder to find in the UI and it's getting buried in the content they get paid for. I know it's a decision they're making to try to be a successful business, but I like it less and less as time goes on. \n\nI haven't used jellyfin enough to have an informed opinion on it and whether I'm going to like the experience overall, but I can say 100 percent I love the simplicity of the UI. Sounds like it might be some work to get plugins setup for some functionality I'd like, but I'm willing to work through that.",

Love the fact that it runs on our Xboxes, Fire TV sticks, iPhone, etc. With Kodi I had to run a separate MariaDB to sync watch status progress, which was a pain on non-Windows devices. With Emby it just works. Spousal Acceptance Factor is 10/10, which is also a major consideration 😉",

I will just use Jellyfin until the internet is back up. Also, between Plex server updates my ability to download media to a device has been broken more often than not, so I just use Jellyfin to download media to a device when I travel if I need to.\n\nMost of the users I’ve shared library access to have chosen to use Plex, if that means anything. And I favor the Plex menus and searching over Jellyfin. Media also begins playing faster after I press play in Plex, and I can choose a different quality at which to transcode before the media even fuller buffers in Plex, and struggle to do that in Jellyfin on iOS. After the media is playing, I think Jellyfin is slightly faster when scrubbing through media, but that might just be because of trickplay.\n\nBoth Plex and Jellyfin are on the same server dedicated solely to them, and share the same Intel Arc A310 between them. I can transcode without any issues in either app, and don’t have any issues with multiple transcodes in either app. At the end of the day, I still favor Plex, but wouldn’t mind Jellyfin at all if that’s all I was able to use for some reason.",

However there were playback issues using direct play with 4k content on all of my devices despite being perfectly fine with every other player not to mention the recent update caused general performance issues and stopped me being able to play my book libraries so I started trying Emby; it's my favourite so far! It has everything I liked from Jellyfin in terms of customisation and lack of third party sign-in with the flawless playback from Plex.

It wouldn’t kill them to add some images and update it once in a while to clarify steps/processes. I’ve found stuff over the years that is contradictory, which adds unnecessary confusion.\n\n(And it’s wholly confusing how to get Plex working without the internet for when that goes down. Is it possible? Dunno. I’ve seen people say both yes and no, but I could never get it working offline, period.)\n\nHonestly, I wish there was a FOSS fork of Plex.

It's not true lossless from source, but it's the highest quality YouTube offers, in a container that plays nicely with most music servers\n\nPlease do not do this. I need to you understand that if the *source is lossy*, converting to FLAC does nothing except waste processing power; converting is not magic, you know? The whole point of FLAC storage is that it's a *lossless* format, that you can then transcode to aac/opus/mp3. Not the other way around. This sort of thing is why I have to do frequency analysis of downloaded FLACS to make sure they're... actually FLACs and not mp3s in a trench coat.\n\nThe quality damage (artifacts) from lossy compression is already done if you download from a lossy source like youtube. Just keep it in the original format.",

Codecs have come such a long way that the converted studio audio uploaded to YT that YT converts doesn't sound a lot different to a good studio release (which will be a honking great file). I'd need headphones on and listening each back and forth to really hear the difference and since I'm due hearing aids next month due to loosing some high band in my right ear, maybe not even then.\n\nIf it works for people and they're happy, then great. If they don't want to use it, also fine. There's many better projects out there but this fills a gap I required for singles in a quality I'm happy with.",

Software engineering has been my full time job for the last 20 years, so even though I've used AI for some parts of this projects, it's not fully \"vibe-coded\" and I'd like to think I applied my learnings from all these years to the whole process.\n\nNew features and contributions can be added just like any other app, no difference there.\n\nWe might like it or not (I certainly have mixed feelings myself), but this seems to be the direction the future of software development is taking. The reality is that, with no help from AI, I would not have been able to make Nametag at all because, sadly, I don't have all the free time it would take to build it \"the old way\", as much as I'd like to. So we need to think: What do we prefer? Apps that are created with AI's help, or no apps at all?  \nOn the other hand, this has opened Pandora's box and now everybody and their cousins can spin up a vibe-coded app with no previous knowledge whatsoever. This is a real pain as we are already starting to see hundreds of thousands of barely-working, unmaintained apps.  \nI don't know what to think yet. I'm just hoping for the best.\n\nI'd encourage you to give it a spin and I'd really appreciate you letting me know if there's something that you think could be improved :)",
