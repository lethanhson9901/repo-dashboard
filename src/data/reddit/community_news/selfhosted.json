I wanted to turn it into a server, but I couldn't enable USB debugging because I couldn't see the screen.\n\n**The Fix:** I used a USB keyboard and blindly typed my PIN, then connected it to Samsung DeX to view the screen and enable USB debugging.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n**OS:** Ubuntu (via Proot-Distro in Termux)  \n**Access:** SSH (automated with Termux:Boot)  \n**Tunnel:** [Playit.gg](http://Playit.gg) (to bypass port forwarding)\n\nIt now sits in my drawer running a MC server for friends.

They have better cameras than almost any webcam and even than most IP cameras. \n\nIts ARM which is getting more and more use outside of small mobile devices, and its essentially a full computer with linux. \n\nLack of IO is the only major downside, but you can still use usb hub to expand it.\n\nI mean, NASA clearly knows this, they used an old samsung phone as part of the helicopter drone they sent to Mars. I dont remember the full list of what it was responsible for though, only that they used its gyros ans accelerometer when the dedicated one failed.",

Batteries in a rack, is not a great idea. There's a reason why servers don't have batteries because even one faulty battery can be a big hazard.\nNeed to mod the battery out.\n\nSince each phone company and then even each phone model have their unique hardware layouts and features, it's probably better to use one device of same type than to make a solution that fits all, i.e., to maybe use one specific phone model or maybe just an r-pi or mini pc, or rack etc.",

And i was happy! Upgrading to Ryzen mini-PC brought me way less emotions than getting stuff up on tv box. It's completely silent (literally nothing moves with USB SSD), it eats <10W with a USB 2.5 HDD (or SSD for even less!), and it mostly comes with \"batteries included\" - WiFi, Ethernet, BT, USB 3.0+2.0 out of the box! And it can easily transcode H264\\\\H265 4K with Jellyfin! Ran a whole \\*arr, torrents, Jellyfin, Jackett, etc on that box. \n\nSure , Ryzen mini-PC is way more powerful, has way more RAM and storage, has SATA for additional drive and more USB ports.\n\nBut i still have some warm feelings bound to this box.

For example, the old Picasa program was one that would strip away the MakerNotes when it was told to write changes into the file. The only camera that I can recall that Picasa didn't strip MakerNotes from was Canon.\n\nThis is also one thing that is so frustrating about the galleries on DPReview. So many of their \"straight from the camera\" are edited. A straight from the camera file is not going to mention Adobe in any of its metadata, yet many do.",

EXIF data can contain way more than you might expect - GPS coordinates, device serial numbers, sometimes even thumbnails of other photos. I'd recommend taking some test shots of random objects, landscapes, or your coffee mug rather than anything identifiable. \n\nYou could also use an older phone or camera if you have one lying around, since they're specifically looking for device variety. The more obscure camera models they get data from, the better the parsing will be for everyone. \n\nThanks for sharing this - hadn't seen it posted anywhere else either.",

Definitely worth it for the learning experience alone.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!",

(I opened an issue for this like 2 years ago and it keeps getting stale lol)\n\nAnd furthermore, the shuffle functions etc don't work well beyond the scope of one library, so either you get a bad mix of every kind of song in one library, or having to fragment your collection by language/genre etc.\n\nTLDR: subpar handling of id3 metadata.\n\nAny subsonic server like Gonic, etc paired with something like Symfonium is the best for music, imo.

It handles indie releases surprisingly well since artists can submit their own metadata.\n\nHonestly the hardest part isn't finding music, it's the discovery side. Spotify's algorithm was the one thing I actually miss. I've been using last.fm scrobbling + listenbrainz to get recommendations, but it's not quite the same.",

It feels like they have an aggressive firewall with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) set up.\n\nThe Situation:\n\n• Blocked: Tailscale (VPNs don't connect), Cloudflare Tunnels (cannot reach my home lab), Steam/Games (connection timeouts), and even standard remote desktop tools often fail.\n\n• Allowed: Basic web browsing (HTTPS) works fine.\n\nWhat I'm trying to do:\n\nI have a home server (Linux machine) back at my parents' house that I want to access for remote dev work, and I also just want to be able to game occasionally.\n\nWhat I suspect:\n\nSince Tailscale and Cloudflare Tunnels are failing, I assume they are blocking UDP heavily and inspecting traffic signatures. Standard VPNs get flagged immediately.\n\nThe Question:\n\nHas anyone successfully bypassed a network this strict? I’m looking for \"hacky\" solutions or obfuscation techniques.\n\n• Would something like Shadowsocks or V2Ray wrapping the traffic in HTTPS work here?\n\n• Is there a way to tunnel UDP over TCP on port 443 effectively?\n\n• Any specific tools for bypassing DPI specifically for university networks?\n\nAny advice or keywords to research would be appreciated!",

I should also mention openvpn is easy to block as well so for those who are seeing and thinking that they don't have a home server but want a solution try protonvpn, you may also be able to layer vpns but this is something more advanced and often doesn't work on mobile.",

But it works.\n\nEdit: One more thing, the other benefit here is that no deep packet inspection can stop this because websites behave the same way.",

Haproxy can do that. I did that like over 10 years ago to tunnel ssh wihtin TLS.’”\n\nUniversities often block tools like Tailscale (a WireGuard-based mesh VPN) and Cloudflare Tunneling (a secure outbound tunnel for exposing services without public IPs) to restrict unauthorized network access or self-hosted services. The suggested workaround disguises non-web traffic as standard HTTPS to evade firewalls, which rarely block TCP port 443 outbound.[reddit +3]\nKey Jargon Breakdown\n•\tVPN over TCP 443 of your VPS: Configure a VPN (like OpenVPN or WireGuard) to use TCP port 443 instead of UDP, routing through a Virtual Private Server (VPS). Firewalls allow this port for web traffic, bypassing VPN blocks.[ipfire +1]\n•\tSNI: Server Name Indication, a TLS extension where clients specify the target hostname during handshake. Proxies like HAProxy inspect SNI to route traffic without full decryption.[discourse.haproxy +1]\n•\tReverse proxy: A server (e.g., HAProxy) that forwards client requests to backends based on rules like SNI, hiding origins and multiplexing protocols on port 443.[stackoverflow]\n•\tHAProxy: Open-source load balancer/reverse proxy that supports TCP/TLS passthrough, SNI matching, and tunneling non-HTTPS like SSH inside TLS.[calomel +1]\n•\tTunnel SSH within TLS: Wrap SSH (port 22) traffic in TLS on port 443 using tools like HAProxy or stunnel, making it indistinguishable from HTTPS.[isaiahnullbyte.github +1]\nHow It Works\nOn your VPS, HAProxy listens on TCP 443, reads SNI from incoming TLS handshakes, and routes matching traffic (e.g., custom SNI for VPN/SSH) to internal services while passing normal HTTPS elsewhere. Clients connect via tools like `openssl s_client` as a ProxyCommand in SSH config to initiate the tunneled connection. This has bypassed restrictive networks like universities for years by mimicking web traffic.[haproxy +3]",

This was an adult only school (no dual enrollment) but we had the same lockdowns as the primary schoolers.  For example, there was a load balancer software mentioned in the course materials that I got curious about.  I couldn't even look it up because that keyword was blocked..in a tech class..for adults.. Their own material was blocked, wtf?  \n\nSo much technology mentioned in the material was locked that I felt it was actively harming the younger students (things like teams, zoom, any kind of remote access (RDP, VPNs, VNCs)--basically stuff I use almost every day in the real world).  An adult class with the same restrictions as Elementary school..\n\nIt was horrible and beyond annoying.  The teacher encouraged exploration so I'd bring in old systems to show classmates different things like ProxMox but 90+% of the download links were blocked, forget updating, even github was blocked so no tteck repo/scripts (RIP)..  \n\nThe teacher was fully understanding and was a pretty solid teacher.  As I was finishing the class he was able to convince the school board to allow him an unfiltered DSL line for his class under the guise that his cybersecurity class was suffering too much under the strict controls (like 20% of his CompTIA lesson materials were blocked from even researching).\n\nIn situations like that I feel that such rules actively undermine the purpose of the school's intent to educate.  I felt that anyone who succeeded after their class(es) there would  do so in spite of the school not because of the it.",

They can block known VPN providers and servers by IP address and ASN.  They can block the ports commonly associated with VPN (such as TCP 22 for ssh, UDP 1194 for OpenVPN, UDP 51820 for Wireguard, UDP 500, 4500, 4510 & 4511 for IPSec).  They might even block *everything* except TCP 80 & 443 for web browsing (but that would cause many things to break, including YouTube).\n\nWhat this leaves is setting up an ssh tunnel to a home system via TCP 443, or setting up an SSL-VPN such as SoftEther.  But this doesn't guarantee that your college's network team won't detect the VPN.  Standard web browser behavior is to open a connection, transfer a page of data, then close the connection.  So for browsing, the connection only usually stays open for a few seconds or minutes and downloads a few hundred to a few thousand bytes per connection, with delays in between while you read that page of data.  With a VPN the connection will stay open for minutes or hours with a constantly increasing amount of data transferred in both directions.

You could try setting up your own IP address-based OpenZiti overlay network and I would expect that to work.

My next steps are upgrading the RAM to 16gb and a 256gb m.2 SSD because it only came with a 64gb m.2 SSD and I barely have any space left.

A lot of weird Sonarr/Radarr issues are just mismatched mount paths.\n\nTurn on regular backups early, before you care about the data. At minimum back up your Jellyfin config, *arr configs, and whatever you’re using for auth. Even just a tar of the config folders to that 8 TB drive on a cron is already a win.\n\nWatch your drive spin-down settings with that external. Some USB externals love to sleep aggressively, which can cause stutters in Jellyfin. You can tweak hdparm or vendor tools, or move “cold” stuff to that disk and keep frequently watched stuff on the NVMe.\n\nSince you’re on Tailscale, you can skip exposing ports to the internet and just use that as your “remote access” layer. Much safer while you’re still learning.\n\nIf you get bored and want to add “internal tools” later, that little HP box is also perfect for running stuff like a small dashboard, admin panel for your DB, etc. Things like Retool / Appsmith / UI Bakery style tools can sit in Docker too so you can poke at your data without giving yourself direct DB access all the time.\n\nOtherwise you’re on a solid path. Biggest tip: change one thing at a time, and keep a simple text file with what you did, so future you can undo the chaos.",

However I'm currently a bit irritated by the Library analysis you're doing - the numbers of movies / TV Show Episodes I have don't really match with any of the statistics I have in Emby itself (only connected Emby so far), and really a bit unsure what it counts as an episode and what as a movie, considering that there are library types like \"mixed content\". \n\nIf I might make a sugguestion, grab all libraries from the server and track the statistics (growth, number of elements, size) for each of them seperately, which will also make it easier to monitor where changes are happening.\n\nAnd if I may add something else - Audiobookshelf would also be a very easy match for what you are doing as a supported server platform.",

I have a pretty sizable library (about 25TB, ~25,000 episodes and about 2,000 movies so not nothin') so I have to imagine that's part of it.\n\nAny ideas on how I can cut down on resource requirements? It's already better than Jellystat and made me stop missing Tautulli which is great- 2GB of RAM set aside just for a monitoring system feels a lil thicc to me; but if I have to suck it up I will. I'm assuming some of that is Redis caching data though which is just something I'll have to deal with.\n\nedit: looks like this was exclusively initial data import duties and things have chilled out significantly an hour later- everyone can safely ignore my comment but leaving it up for posterity.",

Unfortunately I never used Jellystat before, so I can't import from that.\n\nBut I have installed the jellyfin plugins \"playback reporting\" and \"reports\" which have my activity for the last 1.5 years. I wonder if there will be an import options for either of these some day? (I'd like to backfill when/if that happens)\n\nFor notifications it would be nice if there would be a gotify option. I saw the Apprise one but I don't have a specific Apprise API deployed to redirect to gotify. I can't use the webhook either as I can't control what JSON payload I send so gotify receives it as bad request. I guess I can send the webhook raw to n8n, format it there for gotify and send to gotify from n8n for now.\n\nOverall, I like the app, design is great, was easy to deploy, seems it has a great future ahead.

I use it myself via Claude Code. They’re a fantastic productivity booster when used under supervision/with manual code review.\n\nBut for the time being I do think it should be disclosed.  AI still makes tons of errors and if your users know ahead of time they can pay a little closer attention.\n\nCheers",

And I don't like the idea of not having a centralized way to see and manage all my devices and services.\n\nSo either I go for a commercial NAS with a power efficient CPU and I use it like yours, or I build my own truenas sff with a N150. \n\nI'd only have services not-relatd to file sharing in a NAS if its cpu is decent enough AND I have the ability to manage them in a centralized way (i.e proxmox cluster) \n\nI'm still deciding before buying any hardware :/",

You can kinda infer that they mean AGPL, but some uncertainty remains, and that opens you up to legal trouble.\n\nAn [issue](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/issues/8886#issuecomment-3837091846) was opened about this 7 years ago. After doing nothing for all this time, they've finally went ahead and closed it\n\n>Thank you for the community discussion around this topic. I do recognize that our licensing strategy doesn't offer the clarity the community would like to see, but at this time we are not entertaining any changes as such.\n\nThis is a big fuck you to the open source community.

          "text": "Hi there. Very similar to my setup so I have a question because I don't often see Fritzbox routers here:\n\nFritzbox routers (at least my model 7690) has  this NAT problem where you cannot see the network if you are on the network and in the VPN. Its called NAT loopback or NAT hairpin. \n\nThis is the scenario: I am in the city, so I connect to Wireguard because I want to access an internal page, I get home later and the VPN client is still up on my mobile, when I am on the local network, the VPN client ends up blocking all traffic to and from my mobile because it does not know how to handle the NAT when you are with a local address, accessing the public address.\n\nI tried to explain this to Fritzbox support and they didn't know what NAT was, so I gave up with them. Its crazy how somebody can just pretend they have no idea what you are talking about so they can close the ticket as \"delusional customer\" or something like this.\n\nDo you have this problem and are you able to work around it?\n\nMy homelab: In my network, as above but I have a old I5-46xxK processor in an old PC, instead of a Pi. This particular i5 processor support QSV, so I chose it because it can transcode quite well and uses low amount of power when idle. I love the Pi5, have had many Pis in my life, but this PC, although old (DDR3) is really low powered, 32GB RAM and runs Windows Server because I find the block deduplication easy to setup, reliable and efficient. I have a second old PC I use for running docker, Ollama, etc. for my application stack.\n\nEdited to add: I work in a datacenter for a living so from my experience, RAID, anywhere except on RAID specific hardware, in a datacenter, is a bad move. I prefer to have the disks all as stand-alone but I sync my precious folders to multiple devices. This gives me the advantage of lower power, redundant copies and I get to use all the rest of the disk space which would otherwise be used by the RAID.",

I loaded up the compose file, added it to DockerHand, and ran it. First impression was \"Man, this app is bare bones, but everything is exactly as needed, unclutterred and clean\".\n\nThen I looked at who wrote it. Louis Lam. The person who brought you Dockge, Uptime Kuma, RDP Portal.\n\nSometimes you see someone who has the ability to distill usefulness into a pure gold. Louis Lam does this.\n\nSo, no promotion, no AI, no requests for \"what should I do now that I have a server?\", just some appreciation for one of the Rock Stars of the SH/OSS community.\n\nThanks Louis!\n\n[https://github.com/louislam](https://github.com/louislam)",

I personally need something, but I cannot find any free/open-source solution, so I build it for myself, and then share it with you guys.\n\nIt is also a good chance to try new tech/libraries on new projects. For example, It's MyTabs, it was my first time using `better-auth` for auth. And wow! It is amazing. It is easy-to-use and the most powerful auth library that I have ever used.\n\nAlso there are actually many hidden heroes behind the scene. For example, It's MyTabs is using a Score/Tab engine called AlphaTab to render guitar pro files. If no one made this engine, my project would not be possible in the first place.",

If you add the UI it becomes a slippery slope, users will start expecting EVERYTHING to be editable via the UI and the project maintainer will most definitely take this into consideration.\n\nBy all means please DO try and open a pull request once you're confident with your codebase and functionality but I'm leveling your expectations here. I may be wrong btw, I'm just giving you my 2 cent from the dev side of things. \n\nThis is regardless very cool and if they don't accept it I'd create it as a browser extension and work in tandem with homepage, open source it and make this its own product/tool as an enhancement feature <3",

We've tackled the duplicate book problem once and for all, built a sick stats system that actually shows you how your library is being used, added dynamic/Magic Shelves, and a powerful & robust new OAuth system. The amount of new features and fixes in this release is incredible. This is the biggest, most community-driven update CWA has ever had and I'm very grateful to everyone that helped work on it.\" - **CrocodileStick**\n\n**If you enjoy the project and want to support the coffee fund for v5.0.0, you can do so here:**\n\n[Support the project here on Ko-Fi!](https://ko-fi.com/crocodilestick)\n\n# Release V4.0.0 Changelog\n\n# 🚀 Major Features\n\n# Here is the highlight reel:\n\n* **🔍 Smart Duplicate Detection & Resolution:** A completely rebuilt hybrid SQL/Python engine. It detects 95% of duplicates other systems miss (ignoring articles like \"The\", fuzzy matching, etc.). Includes **Auto-Resolution** to merge books automatically and **Scheduled Scans**.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/udmjcnu2yagg1.gif\n\n* **✨ Magic Shelves:** Dynamic, rules-based collections. Create shelves based on tags, ratings, series, or publication dates (e.g., \"Rated 4+ stars\", \"Published in 2024\"). **Bonus:** These sync directly to Kobo devices!\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z0co4j24yagg1.gif\n\n* **📊 Deep Stats Centre:** A brand new dashboard. Track **User Activity** (reading velocity, top users), **Library Stats** (format distribution, language), and **Peak Usage Hours**. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/i99zx0t4yagg1.gif\n\n* **📧 Auto-Send to eReader:** Set it and forget it. New books can be automatically emailed to your Kindle/Kobo/eReader immediately upon ingest, with smart delays to allow for metadata fetching first.\n* **🛡️ Robust OAuth Rewrite:** Completely rewritten authentication. Now supports **LDAP, Reverse Proxy (Authelia/Authentik), and OIDC** natively with auto-user creation. No more redirect loops.\n* **✅ EPUB Fixer 2.0 (No more E999 Errors):** Specifically targets Amazon's strict rejection criteria. Automatically fixes language tags, XML declarations, and broken CSS so your Send-to-Kindle works reliably.\n* **🏷️ Auto-Metadata Fetching:** CWA can now automatically fetch metadata (Google Books, Kobo, Hardcover, etc.) during ingest or before sending to a device.\n\n# ⚡ Performance & Quality of Life\n\n* **Performance Overhaul:** Search is drastically faster, and we’ve moved to WebP thumbnails which reduces page weight by 97%. Large libraries (50k+ books) load instantly now.\n* **Network Share Mode:** Running on a NAS/Unraid? We added a specific mode to handle NFS/SMB locking issues to prevent database corruption.\n* **Better Kobo Integration:** Improved sync reliability, annotations, and a new \"Featured Products\" endpoint.\n* **Hardcover.app ID Fetch:** Automatically links your library to Hardcover for better tracking.\n* **Enhanced Manual Sending:** Want to send a book to a friend? You can now type in any email address on the fly to send a book without creating a user account.\n\n# 🔗 Links\n\n* **Full Change Log:** [Link to GitHub Release/ Changelog](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/releases/tag/v4.0.0)\n* **Docker Hub:** [Link to DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/crocodilestick/calibre-web-automated)\n* **Repo:** [Link to GitHub Project Page](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated)\n\n# Upcoming changes 🔮\n\nMajor changes are still coming to CWA including:\n\n* A brand new Svelte based Frontend. The days of the current Bootstrap UI are numbers and migrating to Svelte ensures that the new UI will still be easy to edit and add to for as many contributors as possible due to it's very familiar syntax to traditional sites and can be compiled with Capacitor for native mobile apps which is very exiting\n* A new web reader, epub.js is a little dated now and there are now much better alternatives\n* A much more robust & powerful progress syncing system that will be able to have CWA act as a single source of truth for reading progress no matter what device you read from\n* Full Text Search functionality\n* 🐁 is coming very soon, the integration just had to be as sensible & respectful to the 🐁 and it's servers as possible and a good balance has now been reached\n\n**A massive thank you to the 60+ contributors who helped test, translate, and code this release.**\n\n**TLDR: CWA now has a new, robust OAuth system, a new smart Duplicate Detection & Auto-Resolution system, a brand-new & very powerful Stats Dashboard, Auto-Send to eReader functionality as well as Automatic Metadata Fetching, a new and Improved Automatic EPUB Fixer service, a new Network Share mode for increased compatibility & reliability with NFS & SMB shares, a major performance overhaul making the whole service more lightweight than ever and so much more!

That’s the kind of stuff that makes a self hosted library feel like a “real” product instead of just a folder of epubs with a UI stapled on. Also appreciate the Network Share mode callout, feels like half the issues in r/selfhosted are “NFS did me dirty again.”\n\nCurious about the Svelte frontend plans: are you aiming to keep things editable for people who just want to tweak templates and CSS, or will it mostly be for folks comfortable building and compiling the app?\n\nEither way, this is the kind of update that makes me want to blow up my current setup and redo it properly.",

As to Svelte, one of the main reasons for choosing it was that it's the most community friendly modern framework available since all of it's syntax is almost identical to normal html, CSS & JS with a few \"runes\" sprinkled in here and there so it should be easy for people to pick up and keep making changes to.

That’s still network-scoped trust, even if the policies are strong and L7-aware.\n\nStrict Zero Trust (as intended in NIST 800-207) flips this: identity and policy create connectivity itself, per service and per session, with no routable network plane, no inbound listeners, and no ambient reachability. If a service isn’t authorized, there’s literally nothing to connect to.\n\nSo I’d frame this as identity-aware networking / ZTNA done well, useful and practical, but architecturally distinct from identity-first, networkless Zero Trust connectivity.

              "text": "Thank you. As for the architecture, I have to make it clear that access control in Octelium is done on a per-resource, per-request basis, and trust is NOT network-scoped whatsoever. In fact, per-resource AND per-request access control is probably the primary rationale behind the entire architecture used in Octelium when compared to remote access VPNs and other remote access tools and gateways. Maybe the confusion is coming from having a VPN-like \\`octelium connect\\` command in the client-based access mode; however, Octelium's architecture is very different from VPNs, since every request, which is transported over WireGuard/QUIC in the client-based mode and HTTPS+short-lived access token for the clientless mode, is intercepted by an identity-aware proxy in the Cluster, which is running on top of a k8s cluster, that  does authentication/L7-aware authorization via policy-as-code/dynamic routing/visibility and auditing on a per-request basis. Simply every single resource/application that needs to be protected by the Cluster is represented by a Service that's implemented by a L7-aware identity-aware proxy in the Cluster itself, and that identity-aware proxy intercepts every single requests from users to the corresponding protected resource/upstream. In short, \\`octelium connect\\` does not guarantee that you have access to any Service whatsoever unless explicitly set by a CEL/OPA Policy (read more here https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/core/policy) and such Policies can be attached to specific Users, Groups, Sessions, Devices, Services or Service Namespaces. Users simply never have direct access to the protected resources and instead every single request has to be authenticated, authorized and audited by the identity-aware proxy sitting between the user and the corresponding protected resource. You can read more about Octelium's architecture in detail if you are interested [https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/overview/how-octelium-works](https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/overview/how-octelium-works)\n\nAlso, as for the \"non-routability\" issue, while Octelium supports access to internal resources of any type behind NAT like any VPN, I don't think that NIST 800-207 says anything regarding having security through obscurity, in fact, I'd argue that the standard clearly advocates for unification of identity-based access control at the resource level on a per-request basis whether it be via private/client-based mode or via the clientless public mode. The latter case is the whole rationale behind the BeyondCorp architecture championed by Google. In other words, if you could do true identity-based access control at the resource level on a per-request basis, i.e. true zero trust, then it doesn't matter whether the resource is publicly exposed on the internet via an identity-aware proxy or is behind NAT, since the same exact access control mechanism is applied in either case.",

                  "text": "Thanks for the clarification... I think we’re actually closer than it might appear.\n\nI agree that per-resource, per-request authorization at L7 is foundational to Zero Trust, and your proxy-centric model clearly enforces that well. Where I’m drawing the distinction isn’t whether requests are authorized per-request (we agree there), but whether network reachability still exists as a prerequisite.\n\nIn proxy / gateway–based ZTNA models (including BeyondCorp-style), identity and policy are enforced after a resource is reachable... even if that reachability is brokered via NAT, tunnels, or an identity-aware gateway. This works well for many L7 use cases, but it still means a routable address space exists and must be mediated.\n\nThat structural choice is exactly the point raised in [Google’s BeyondCorp essay on the long tail of Zero Trust](https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/beyondcorp-and-long-tail-zero-trust), some protocols and application patterns don’t naturally fit a request/response proxy model (legacy protocols, interactive sessions, UDP/peer models, etc.). In those cases the proxy must terminate and re-originate, adapt semantics, or impose its own constraints, which becomes an application compatibility tradeoff rather than a flaw per se.\n\nIdentity-first overlays take a different approach: there is no routable network plane at all. Identity and policy don’t just authorize traffic - they create the service path itself, per service and per session. If a service isn’t authorized, there is no IP, no port, no listener, and nothing to proxy or scan.\n\nSo the distinction isn’t “per-request vs not,” but:\n\n* Authorize traffic to reachable resources (proxy / ZTNA model)\n* Eliminate reachability and create connectivity only by policy (identity-first model)\n\nBoth fit within NIST 800-207’s Zero Trust architecture, but they make different tradeoffs around exposure, blast radius, protocol compatibility, and operational model, especially as you move beyond HTTP and cloud-native workloads.",

I, personally use that all the time, and have my own VPN by deploying a SOCKS5 server as a managed container (read more about managed contianers in the docs).

In short, I believe Octelium is much more advanced but flexible overall, and it's more comparable to Cloudflare Access or Teleport in terms of architecture.

What's the value add of QUIC support? I am not familiar with it. Looks like it's an improvement against Wireguard censorship?\n\n2. I've been using the ingress controller [Contour](https://projectcontour.io/about/) for many years, and am still using their CRD [projectcontour.io/v1/HTTPProxy](https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.33/config/fundamentals/) for defining ingress. I've thought about moving to the newer Gateway CRDs, but it looks like Octelium also has its own Envoy wrapper and resource definitions for Service so that it can add CEL expressions evaluated by Vigil/Octovigil. Can you clarify the boundary between what Octelium is providing vs what other ingress controllers may provide? Maybe I also have the wrong impression, but I see a lot of common resource names at https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/reference/resources without a link to the specific specs. These are all unrelated to k8s, but just look similar to k8s?\n\n3. I see User and Group resources and using these as part of CEL expressions on the service resource. That seems like it would be very difficult as you grow on the platform. I have been using FreeIPA for awhile, so I'm just curious how something like groups defined in LDAP might work with policy expressions: https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/core/policy. There are some examples with `ctx` but I am still not clear. Do I have to use the group resources?\n\nI guess what I kind of miss is an IDL spec where it just says exactly what the grammar is for these things.\n\nStill, all very interesting. Will definitely keep researching. Thanks!",

As for why QUIC is added, for a few reasons, among which is FIPS-140 compliance, obfuscation since QUIC traffic is simply HTTP3 traffic when inspected by middleboxes, and I honestly believe in QUIC's superiority long term (e.g. AES hardware acceleration, congestion control, good implementations by most top programming languages, etc..). \n\n2. Octelium can indeed operate as a Kubernetes ingress, I'd say a much more advanced and dynamic one, compared to strict K8s ingress controllers using the, I'd say, K8s very primitive Ingress resources. For example, you can dynamically route based request paths, query arguments, even serialized JSON body if you want to, you can manipulate requests and responses including body with Lua scripts and Envoy ext\\_proc. However, you need to know that Octelium comes with its own separate Envoy-based ingress and it has nothing to do with the Kubernetes canonical \"Ingress\" resources, yet Octelium can co-exist with any k8s ingress controller running on the same cluster. Simply Octelium doesn't care about your k8s ingress at all. You need to use Octelium and its own resources to achieve that K8s ingress functionality. Also note that Octelium's resources are not wrappers around k8s CRDs, Octelium has its own resources stored in its own separate postgres database. Again, Octelium resources are NOT k8s CRDs.\n\n3. \\`ctx\\` just means \"context\". It's basically the \"request context\" map that wraps all the request context, including all info about the User, Session, Device if exists, all User's Groups if any, the accessed Service and its Namespace, as well as the request's layer-7 info (e.g. HTTP request path, method, headers, etc..). The docs are full of examples on how to write Policy rules (check out the User, Service pages and the example guides such as [https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/ai/ai-gateway#access-control](https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/ai/ai-gateway#access-control) and [https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/ai/self-hosted-mcp#access-control](https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/ai/self-hosted-mcp#access-control) and https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/guide/service/http/api-gateway#access-control), but this [https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/core/policy](https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/core/policy) should be your main reference.\n\n",

I am guessing no based on a quick read of https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/management/core/identity-providers which means I need to replicate my groups to Octelium configs.",

Bypassing middleboxes is certainly one of the main reasons for supporting QUIC but there many other reasons as I mentioned earlier such as FIPS-140 compliance, hardware acceleration (e.g. AES-NI), seamless addressing to dynamic endpoints, etc... and I am personally a big fan of QUIC overall.",
