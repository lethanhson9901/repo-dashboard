Some users raised concerns about limited spaces (servers) capabilities \n\nElement IS \"corpo-ish\", but it's still free and open-source, [licensed under the Affero General Public License v3](https://element.io/blog/sustainable-licensing-at-element-with-agpl/) and connects to the free, open-source, decentralized and end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Matrix protocol. FluffyChat, which you linked, is just another client that connects to the Matrix protocol like Element - though in the testing I've done, Element remains *by far* the most mature client nearest to Discord feature-parity.\n\nElement works great as a communication app, and works well as a Discord alternative - but some of Discord's more gaming-focused features (streaming, and in-game detection) do not exist in Element and are arguably outside of its scope. It very much is more \"corpo\" in the sense that it is intended as secure business collaboration software rather than as a gaming voice chat client. It would be rad if the community could fork Element and make a more gaming-focused version of it with streaming capabilities at a minimum.\n\nBut the entire Matrix ecosystem of different server software, server instances, and client software, makes it resistant to the bullshit Discord just pulled (and will pull, in the future, as investors demand more \"revenue streams\") and strongly protects user privacy.",

              "text": "XMPP is definitely not a replacement.\n\nI have been looking at XMPP. A lot. So I'm going to write a lot about why XMPP is not a replacement.\n\nThe biggest issue is everything is implemented as extensions (XEPs), all the good ones are marked experimental, nobody implements everything.\n\nNow even if we had a great client and server combo that implemented all the latest XEPs - the biggest missing feature (in my opinion) is video calling that utilizes a selective forwarding unit (SFU) with drop-in features.\n\nThe clients that do calling all do peer-to-peer which just does not scale past like 4-5 people. You really need an SFU so everybody isn't having to push their video out to every other participant and destroying their upload bandwidth.\n\nAnd every client I've tried does \"calls\" - you call up somebody or a group of people and they answer and join. Basically every call is this ephemeral room, Discord has persistent rooms that you just jump into.\n\nJitsi Meet is pretty close - it runs on XMPP, and has the discord-like drop-in but they're doing a bunch of custom, non-XEP stuff. So it doesn't work with any other clients. And all it does is audio/video anyway. \n\nAnd then on top of that - screen sharing with app audio. Discord just does it with no futz. I've got friend groups that will stream things to discord and people just drop in whenever. I think Movim is the only XMPP app that does any kind of screen sharing. But again I'm pretty sure it's all peer to peer so is doesn't scale, and I'm not sure if it captures app audio.\n\nAnd that's just the audio/video stuff.\n\nThere's the lack of emotes. Custom emotes are huge. There's a XEP for stickers but nobody implements it and even if they did - there's no concept of inline images mixed with text in XMPP, so the stickers XEP doesn't get you there.\n\n(There used to be inline images via XHTML-IM but that's deprecated).\n\nSpaces. XMPP has a new experimental XEP for spaces but nobody implements it and the XEP isn't clear at all on what they're supposed to actually do. They clearly intend to mimic discord \"servers\" but the whole thing is just a mess.\n\nGetting people signed up. There's been work for an invites concept but man is it confusing. Every server that has a web+invite registration process uses this same, incredibly confusing webpage that has never been used by a normal person.\n\nIf you get an invite to join a discord you get a webpage. If you don't have an account you sign up. You join their discord. You can start immediately using it in your browser.\n\nIf you get an invite to join an XMPP server you get this page that's like \"hey you need a client!\" with a QR code and overly long descriptions about a few different clients. I think they expect people to do in-app registration? Nobody wants to do that. I've already clicked the link somebody sent me.\n\nWay at the bottom is the \"just let me sign up\" link. It's totally backwards - you should just go straight into making an account, then get taken to a page with links to clients.\n\nGod and the clients. The only really good android clients are paid on Google Play. That alone is a deal breaker for a ton of people. You can get them for free from f-droid but again - normal people don't do that. \n\nConversations for Android is the nicest in terms of UX but I think it's fallen behind a but on features.\n\nMonocles is a conversations fork with some nice features but also tries to be social media with feeds and store and shit. And I think it does something with an optional telephone service? It's weird.\n\nThey all do this thing where logging in presents like 5 options. If you have a properly implemented server with the right DNS records, all you really need is a username/password field. The more options you give to a normal person the more they're going to find it confusing and just quit. \n\nIt should just be - you get an invite link. You make an account. Then you get linked to some apps and a decent web chat to get started right there.\n\nNobody is going to read multiple paragraphs just put out \"use this on Android, use this on iPhone\". The apps should just let you log in and not prompt you to sign up for weirdo phone service or give you this whole menu of \"I don't have an account and need one, I have an account, I'm a snikket user\"\n\nEven the whole \"use this app on iPhone, this app on Android, this app on macOS, this app on Windows\" really loses people. Regular people don't distinguish between a client and a service. It's all just \"discord\". \"Gmail\". \"Reddit\". You lose a lot of people when you say \"use conversions to connect to my XMPP server\".\n\nSnikket is trying to work on that a bit by just making everything \"snikket\". \n\nAnd then yeah, accounts. Try to figure out what to do when you forget your password.\n\nXMPP is great in a closed environment where you control the clients, have an external authentication system. But it is just absolutely terrible for regular people.",

I would always have this issue with the latter two where shit that me and my friends would say 5-10 minutes in the past would suddenly be rebroadcast to everyone, which was frustrating and really confusing especially when we were in the middle of some action. That never happened to me with Mumble.\n\nAlternatively, there's also the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) messaging protocol via applications like [Element](https://element.io/en). Matrix is a free, open-source, decentralized (you can use public Matrix servers like matrix.org or host your own server) and end-to-end encrypted rich text, video, and voice messaging protocol - while Element is arguably the most feature-complete and maturely developed of the available Matrix compatible client applications. It, too, is free and open-source, and is also easy-to-use, nice to look at, and works SIMILARLY to Discord. If you want to use it on your phone, be sure to pick up Element X over Element Classic, as Element X supports voice and video communication on mobile.\n\nI've migrated my entire Discord \"server\" over there, and recreated it as a Matrix \"space\" with \"rooms\" that correspond to my Discord channels - and by and large, it has worked exceptionally well. Discord IS pretty clearly a little more gamer-focused, so the screen-sharing features of Matrix, while they work quite well (and aren't resolution-limited without Nitro or a paid tier), aren't great for streaming and obviously you lack some of the more gamer-centric features (such as Discord's ability to tell your friends what game you're playing).",

Looking at that library now, it seems to have improved significantly, so I may give that another shot. While I did my best to implement within the spec, I would also be more comfortable leveraging a \"battle-tested\" library than a bespoke implementation.\n\n\n> As an update on the status of this PR generally, I am considering closing this and splitting it further into pieces, in hopes that it will be more likely to be reviewed in a timely manner (and also easier for me to keep up-to-date). As part of that work, I may explore a new server implementation using such a library instead of a hand-rolled and likely flawed implementation.\n\n\nSo my best guess is we either see it this year, or in another 4 years with a solid shmaybe",

You are invited to call, text, or IM me asking for stuff. Alternatively, you can use this website.\" If someone makes a jellyseerr request, I have it configured to send a webhook to Home Assistant to instruct my color-changing bulbs to blink a specific pattern. My Philips hue bulbs bring me great joy from prior and them communicating to me there's a request is awesome. Connecting sonarr + radarr for automatic downloads is optional. I don't use this feature but the online userbase loves it\n\nIt is superb at looking at the history of requests. I have two annoying Plex users that make requests but then don't always watch them. I don't like that. When it happens, I want to know about it. It's a superb tool for saying \"hey why are you requesting so much and then not touching it?\" Seerr has a feature to make requests for other people. If one of my Plex users asks me for something offline, I add a jellyseerr request in his name to keep track of it. Super handy.\n\nSeerr is fantastic from existing as a catalog. Remember that time years ago the first time you discovered and interacted with Newegg's or mcmaster's online catalog? It's super organized as hell, is fast, and it feels like it genuinely wants to show you what you're asking. Jellyseerr is fantastic for all things movie and shows. The interface is better than all the online ones for interacting with movie and shows.\n\nIn conclusion, try it. Run it on a Raspberry Pi or a disposable virtual machine. Interact with it. Shut it down if you don't like it.",

The tipping point for me was when I spent 15 minutes SSH'ing into 3 different servers to check why a service was slow, when a single glance at a dashboard would've shown the bottleneck instantly.\n\nWhat makes dashboards actually useful (vs vanity metrics):\n\n1. **Actionable alerts, not just graphs** - Don't just show CPU usage, show \"CPU >80% for 5+ minutes\" with a button to see which process. Context matters more than raw data.\n\n2. **Correlation over isolation** - Putting network I/O + disk I/O + response time on the same view reveals causation. Separate dashboards hide the relationships.\n\n3. **Historical comparison** - Being able to scroll back and see \"oh, this spike happens every Monday at 2am\" turns mysteries into patterns. Log retention + time-series data is the whole point.\n\n4. **Service dependencies** - A map showing which services talk to which, with health indicators, prevents the \"everything is red and I don't know where to start\" panic.\n\nThe key is treating dashboards as operational tools, not vanity projects. If you're not using it during an incident, it's probably not measuring the right things.\n\nWhat dashboard software did you end up settling on? I'm always curious what people find most useful for self-hosted setups.",

It's federated, and is basically a Discord clone with extra (Actual useful) features that people have asked for for years. While they don't have self-hosted docs up yet, it apparently is self-hostable. \n\nThat being said, I am a bit worried about their monetization. While I think it's pretty neat that they give everything for free on self-hosted (and let you even turn on your own monetization). I feel like it's either going to be one big server on their end, and they won't be able to support the costs. (Discord was upside down until recently, likely due to 'quests') or very disorganized self-hosted severs. The problem is the 'premium' doesn't transfer to other instances. So if you buy it for their instance, won't transfer to community instances. (Which makes sense, don't get me wrong). But for ease-of-use, federated apps are confusing for people. I can already see someone upset they spent 50$ then join a server and they don't have their 'perks' or something. \n\nAdditionally, from looking at other alternatives, it seems the big gatekeeper to self-hosting this stuff is amount of users and processing power/storage/bandwidth. I forget which project it was, but it basically noted that for Discord to host a single server of 100 people, it must be blowing away money hosting the text, images, VOIP encoding/decoding to multiple users, video encoding/decoding, etc. Now if you scale that up to server with even more (One of mine I run is ~5000 users) it's likely out of the realm of actual self-hosting.",

Because it's not about the technology, it's about the user base.

Just exactly how much they can get away with turning up the heat without the average user noticing or caring. And they're getting better at it every day.\n\nWe can sit here on Reddit and complain all we want (as is our god given right), but the tech landscape is fundamentally just a lot dumber than it used to be. People just want things to work and they'll sacrifice a lot of agency to get there. It's the flipside of how accessible everything has become.\n\nI don't want to give the impression that I don't think it's good to push for alternatives, I think it's important.

Discord is a Chat/forum platform with calling.\n\nEveryone wants a Discord killer with the same features as discord. But nobody wants that new platform to also do exactly the same things that discord did. And sadly because of the UK/Australian governments a new \"social\" platform will have to do the exact same thing (eventually).\n\nIf you want to have your privacy, if you want to not have your chats scanned, if you want to not have to age verify yourself.

Im not aware of any XEP that defines voicechannels - a feature that matrix also lacks - but the worst thing is both the lack of modern clients and the hoops you need to jump through to get a modern chatting experience.\n\nSure, theres Conversations that works very well, but thats about it. The only semi modern UI on desktops im aware of is provided by Gajim - and that UI is still absolutely horrible. There used to be inconsistencies with certain XEPs, but thats in the past by now I think.\n\nBut if you want to enable proper encrypted stanzas, if you want file uploading and so on you need to configure all those things yourself. And its not fun, at all. I also dont remember there being a registration mode that uses tokens, as is offered by matrix, however to be frank at some point I just created the accounts by hand and sent the passwords to the three family members I want to chat with, with the plea to change passwords first.\n\nThe main argument for matrix right now is both the featureset for modern chatting applications that it has integrated, the easy registration of users and the ability to verify new devices with features OOTB.",

Definitely alpha - web client only, no DMs, mixed browser support (chromium based is rock solid tho), general lack of features. \n\nThat being said, it's really easy to set up, the quality of voice and streams is great, it's lightweight, and it's not trying to do more than I need it to.

Honestly I think that  we need to move away from the old \"1 stop shop\" applications that try to do everything and move back to individual services.\n\nI currently use TeamSpeak / Mumble / Jitsi Meet as my alternative for voice comms with my community if / when Discord has issues and for communication I use services like Telegram but I also have in the past used XMPP (Prosody, and I am looking at self-hosting again) and I have self-hosted Matrix (But I don't like the state of the homeservers and the community drama. Also not sure of the privacy comment), and if I want to actually have a community I'll probably host a web forum like the good old days (although, Valour App looks promising).\n\nI think that changing our attitude back to the KISS principle and having different services for different purposes is a *good thing* and hopefully communities will go back to Wikis and Forums instead of using private Discords for literally everything. Discord unfortunately has deflated the value of voice / text services to the point where everyone expects something for free even though it's costly to maintain and I think that's a shame.",

As it is right now, there is no competition for Teams and Discord is the closest thing, but an awful alternative. If they make a \"Discord Pro\" and it is good as Teams, it can be very lucrative for them.

Navigating webRTC and STUN/TURN servers can be a nightmare, not to mention going across mobile and home networks.\n\nPersonally, I have a working replacement in Rocketchat and a Jitsi based video backend, including a turnserver. Rocketchat has Jitsi integration in the app store. It has a nice ui that you can customize with CSS. If you have a small server(under 50 people) you can get the \"starter edition\" which you will have to go through their servers to get reliable push notifications on mobile, otherwise they can be spotty. If your server is larger than that, the community edition is up to 500 people, but read receipts and push notifications to mobile probably wont work(Edit I just checked, they do work but are capped at 10 000), as nothing runs through rocketchat main servers. That being said there is E2EE available and with either option.\n\nJitsi can be a bit confusing, its actually 3 modules(videobridge, prosody for auth, 1 more) and you WILL have to edit config files to get proper performance, and security by properly setting shared secrets. That being said I have found it better than zoom once you set it up properly. Jitsi has docker as well but again you will have to know how to edit config files or properly set volumes/bind mounts in docker to make it easy (which you should know if you want to use docker anyways).\n\nSo yes you can, but it might be above the skill level and patience of most people.\n\nEdit: a turnserver can be tricky to set up with reverse proxy.

Privacy‑friendly user accounts (no personal data required)**  \nUsers should be able to join a self‑hosted instance without providing any personal information.  \nAuthentication would happen through lightweight third‑party OAuth providers (e.g., Twitch, GitHub, Google), but only requesting the minimal openid scope. This means the app receives only a unique, provider‑generated user ID, no mail, no name, no profile picture, no personal data at all, and then simply choose a nickname inside the app. This keeps onboarding simple, avoids storing sensitive data, and removes the need for admins to manually create accounts.\n\n**2. Zero‑bandwidth media handling through client‑side uploads (integrated in the UI)**  \nBesides the ability to embed any external link directly (classic URL embedding), the app should also support a seamless client‑side upload flow integrated into the UI.  \nWhen a user uploads a file, the app would send it directly from the user’s end to an external hosting service (e.g., Imgur, ImgBB, Catbox), without ever passing through the self‑hosted server.  \nThe external service returns a public URL, and the app automatically embeds it in the message.  \nThis keeps the instance extremely lightweight and avoids both bandwidth and storage costs.\n\nWould something like this be possible or even make sense? Do existing applications already implement features like these?",

          "text": "BueIris and Frigate are probably the two most commonly used software based NVRs.  BlueIris requires a small one time licensing fee and it comes with 12 months of updates.  If you want updates after that initial support period, you simply have to pay another small maintenance fee for another 12 months of updates.  The nice thing is that the original license is perpetual so the software works whether you decide to pay for any future maintenance plans or not.  Your paid maintenance time also does not need to be continuous, which means you can choose not pay the maintenance fee for years and then pay the fee and get 12 months of upgrades starting from the day you make the payment (not the day your support ended previously).  I haven't used Frigate, but BlueIris is 100% worth the cost IMHO.\n\nBoth will save your footage locally and the recommended network setup is to prevent your cameras from being able to access the \"internet\" at all.  There are several ways to accomplish this, but there is ZERO reason to allow you cameras access to the internet.\n\nIt's easy to set up remote access to your local network to view your cameras when you are not home, but that is outside the scope of this post.  It is also easy to make backups of your raw footage should you feel it necessary to do (normally it is not), but again that is outside the scope of this post.\n\nI run BlueIris in a VM on one of my Proxmox machines.  It works great and has all the benefits of other Proxmox VMs (backups, etc)",

Had a bunch of random ONVIF cameras stuck them in blue iris. \n\nBlue iris is ok and not incredibly expensive it looks and acts like dated software. It has some AI detection capabilities built in, but in my experience it needs a lot of setup and trial and error and configuration. It also only runs on Windows. \n\nFargate is more modern and free and has good home assistant integration. Also has AI detection built in but requires a lot of setup and configuration from scratch so there's a learning curve. \n\nUltimately I decided I was tired of tinkering and just wanted cameras and detection to work without constant monitoring and adjustments and went with Unifi. It's a bit costly upfront to get the cameras and NVR but in my experience it's a far better experience. Setup is easy, the cameras are great, detection always just works, and the app is great. I've got no complaints and wouldn't go back to either of the software. \n\nIf you're ok with a bigger upfront cost and want hassle free go with Unifi. If you don't want to spend and have cameras to use already you could go with Frigate if you're ok with learning and tinkering. If you want slightly less tinkering and ok with running a windows server, go with Blue Iris.",

They went so far as to tell me I was misleading in what I was showing is possible. It was very frustrating lol. \n\nThat said, I’m leaving the notifications about all “threat levels” on for the foreseeable future and testing some scenarios (I’m not joking when I say this, I’ll be heading out at about midnight one night holding a bat and pantomiming breaking into one of our cars while my face is covered just to see what happens lol). After I’ve really put everything through its paces I’ll be comfortable having alerts just for higher threat levels (but will leave Frigate to record any/all motion and objects…but it will reduce the mental bandwidth I need to dedicate to notifications).",

Our TV's automatically open Plex when they're powered on.  Have a local voice assistant(s) using Linux Voice Assistant (hence the second smaller LLM that's running) and pulled out all of our alexa devices.

These models are trained locally on your machine using ImageNet via MobileNetV2.\n\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements\n\nObject classification models are lightweight and run very fast on CPU. Inference should be usable on virtually any machine that can run Frigate.\n\nTraining the model does briefly use a high amount of system resources for about 1–3 minutes per training run. On lower-power devices, training may take longer.\n\nA CPU with AVX instructions is required for training and inference.",

It has a lot of small issues that keep popping up, some of that is client specific, some is server, and some is protocol. Message read indicators are wonky, threads are inconvenient, notifications sometimes just disappear.... None of that is a big deterrent on its own, but it all adds up.\n\nThen there are the big issues. Sometimes the encryption can break and you're left unable to read people's messages. The only fix for that is waiting and hoping it fixes itself. Granted, I haven't had that happen in a while, but who knows if it's actually fixed or just pure luck.\n\nFrom the hosting perspective it's also a nightmare. I'll leave the server setup troubles, there's been plenty said about that. If you enable federation, your users can join a server that has illegal content, that gets cached on your server and suddenly you're hosting illegal materials. Or someone can make a private encrypted room which you as the owner can't moderate, and who knows what can go on in those.\n\nI'll be honest, I've been very optimistic about matrix 5 years ago when it was starting to get popular. But the same issues I've had then are still there, and instead of hearing about fixing those, I'm gearing about the devs getting into more and more dramas",

Ran synapse privately for some time but went back to XMPP. The key management is horrible and moderating is even worse. CSAM is distributed through federation and they have a hard time stopping this. If you have a user which joins a naughty groupchat it will be mirrored to your server. I have no clue how to manage keys for users who are not tech savvy.\n\nIt's also a privacy nightmare since everything is mirrored in all locations. I'm quite sure it's actually a honeypot for intelligence agencies. The load on the server is also really high and gets ridiculous if you have a lot of federated users.\n\nIt's explained in detail here : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8KEuAEYjQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8KEuAEYjQ4)",

All the ingredients are there, and the initial goal for the project was always to provide a decentralised, secure, open platform where communities and organisations could communicate together. However, the reality is that the team at Element who originally created Matrix have had to focus on providing deployments for the public sector (see here or here) to be able to pay developers working on Matrix. **Some of the key features expected by Discord users have yet to be prioritised (game streaming, push-to-talk, voice channels, custom emoji, extensible presence, richer hierarchical moderation, etc).** Meanwhile no other organisation stepped up to focus on the “communication tool for communities” use case and provide a production ready Discord alternative, but clients like Cinny or Commet may feel much closer to Discord. On the other hand, Matrix goes far beyond Discord in other areas: both messages, files and calls are end-to-end-encrypted; we have read receipts; Matrix is an open protocol everyone can extend, and in the end, most Matrix clients are open source; there is nothing stopping developers from starting their own project based on existing ones and adding the missing features themselves. They may even eventually get accepted in the original projects!\n\nhttps://matrix.org/blog/2026/02/welcome-discord/",

I literally have more than 50 open threads I cannot delete, and they come back / are restored when I reflashed even my Android device and installed a new or different client.\n\nI don't understand how the server and protocol implementation can be _this_ buggy. It's just a riddle to me how anybody can be fine with those types of bugs and not throw their smartphones out of the window.\n\nFor now my faith in matrix kinda died out, and I think something like an xmpp server would be more reasonable (if the clients fulfill OMEMO + XEPs for OTR stuff, which is a whole other story of compatibility issues) for most chat related things. If I need a voice chat with friends, I would host a mumble server (which is pretty close to what Teamspeak was at the time).\n\nContact management and contact discovery is also an issue on its own, because most chat clients assume you know all the handles / urls / identifiers which normal people actually never do if they want to contact you.\n\nBriar, for example, is unusable in practice because of that, because you effectively cannot discover contacts. Both contacts at the same time have to know each other's identifier that you have to have sent via third-party communication channel, and on top of that simultaneously have to do a handshake request; which effectively never works when people aren't standing exactly next to each other. Their NAT breaking techniques also never work in normal environments outside of carrier-grade NATs so most people always tell me that Briar never works because it silently fails to connect/discovery peers and contacts without any hint on why it didn't work.\n\nThe drama of revolt (aka stoat chat now until the next ADHD rebrand) is too much for me to get into right now, so I haven't tried that out yet. But from what I've heard it's pretty similar to Slack in how you use it.\n\nWhen thinking about the \"golden days\" of xmpp and jabber and gmail/facebook chat betas and the interoperability of chat clients like Trillian and Pidgin... man, it kinda went straight downhill from there.",

I didn't want to trust a random SaaS provider with my private goodbye messages or emergency credentials, so I decided to build my own solution.\n\nIt's called **Aeterna**. It's a simple self-hosted dead man's switch.\n\nThe idea is straightforward: You set a timer (3, 6, or 12 months). If you don't send a \"heartbeat\" to the system before the time runs out, it assumes you're \"offline\" for good and triggers:\n\n* **Emails:** Sends out those final messages you've prepared for family or friends.\n* **Webhooks:** Triggers whatever automation you need (shutting down servers, notifying services, etc.).\n\nI built it because I believe some messages should outlive us, but they should also stay under our own control until the very last moment.\n\n  \nIt’s open source, so I’d love to get your feedback on it!\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/alpyxn/aeterna](https://github.com/alpyxn/aeterna)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ajalnyw1p8jg1.png?width=1417&format=png&auto=webp&s=49dfd0269c3ea7a2dfbf2f3b6c20f28d0fe3c5dc\n\n  \n",

But if you don't restart the docker service, you will run into issues like not being able to create a new stack because it's not able to create a new network. Let's not forget docker uses the host's kernel.\n\nEither way: kernel update = downtime. Arch updates the kernel pretty often. As is, more than once a week. Sure you don't *have* to update your system that often, but I guess if someone picks arch, then surely that must be something they are after. But then again, they use it as a docker host so that's pretty conflicting.\n\nI too use Arch and I too at some point thought it was simpler to just stick to the one distro I'm the most familiar with but really nothing beats having the right tool for the job. Just go with a stable LTS distro, slap the docker repos on it, configure unattended upgrades to your liking, schedule some periodic reboots and forget about it.",

              "text": "When one of my early servers died, it was basically a nightmare both because i didn't really have any backup of the server install (media was fine) so it took me a couple of days to rebuild it with all of the dependency and installation management, and then all of the configuration for all of the services. At that time, I built it in a VM instead and started snapshotting, but that also had some downsides. Updates could still be fraught and break stuff, and snapshotting took up a lot more backup space than I would have liked.\n\nDocker and docker-compose make that a bajillion times easier. Dependency management is gone and it basically becomes as easy to add services as it is to grab something from the app store. Docker compose also means that I don't need to backup anything other than my docker-compose.yaml and the config directories for the services I use, so that's just a git repo that I push when there are changes. So if I lost my media server today, I could basically install whatever distro (most server distros are going to come out of the box with docker and git) do a ``git pull`` and ``docker-compose up -d`` and I'm off to the races. It would probably take less than a half hour for me to go from bare metal to my server as it runs today. Well, maybe slightly more depending on internet speed. \n\nI'd suggest people check out [Yet Another Media Server](https://yams.media/) if you want to dip your toes in. It's basically a script that sets up docker-compose with the typical *arr stack, plex/emby/jellyfin, and at least torrents with easy integration of VPN.",

Been using this since half a year and will never look back.\n\nToday I looked at the [open PRs on Komodo's GitHub page](https://github.com/moghtech/komodo/pulls) and noticed somebody has opened like 50 PRs within two days tackling various open issues. All the PR descriptions are most likely AI generated (which is perfectly fine) but my assumption is that the code might also be entirely vibecoded given the short time frame of the contributions. I'm not a Rustacean at a professional level but how will we ever be able to ensure quality of FOSS projects if this turns out to be true?\n\nDon't want to step on somebody's toes, maybe there is a hooded guy with an insane amount of ambition and insider knowledge to the project and energy drinks in a darkened room with green characters flying across the display just like a Hollywood hacker movie scene who managed doing this one handed while playing the entire single player campaign mode of Age of Empires 2. If this is the case - all my respect is yours.\n\nEDIT: To all the \"AI is the future\"-people: I got you. Treating AI as a productivity tool is absolutely fine, I do it, you do it, most devs do nowadays. Sure, anyone can vibecode an app in a breeze today that plays music from somewhere. But there are limits when anyone thinks he can become a professional dev engineer without understanding what the software does and why it does it. Applications quickly reach a level of complexity where AI has its limits. Try conjuring up some professional business software from scratch with an LLM. Or peek at regulated markets, such as software in hospitals or aviation. Not to mention the DevOps who set up the infrastructure on which distributed systems run and scale.\n\nIt's us professionals who have to judge whether what comes out of LLMs is good, according to whatever standards. You don't let Gemini make trading decisions for you with full access to your broker. It's no different with programming. And no developer wants to read through pages of hallucinatory source code (here's my problem I wanted to spotlight with my original post implicating risks for the FOSS community) that might somehow does what it's supposed to do, if they have to find a small bug in there that cripples the entire system.\n\nI'm not worried about my job. On the contrary, I'm grateful for the new tools that make us more productive when we know how to use them properly. But a hammer stays a hammer and does not become a carpenter on its own.",

              "text": "Hey mbecks, just to share my experience, as I've also experienced vibe coded submissions, looking into them cost a lot of time and wasn't enjoyable, stressful at times, even, I'd say. They were usually too large to review sensibly, with a lot of issues and feedback coming out of them. So recently, I've implemented a \"no vibe code\" contributor guideline, which seems to have calmed the submissions a bit. It even spawned a fully vibe-coded fork, which is fine as long as they follow the licence.\n\nIn my opinion, do what feels right for you. It's your project, your standards, and also because you're the one who needs to handle the fallout (issues/bugs) from those submissions. I am personally a lot stricter now, rejected a few, which has its downsides for contributors, but it does keep my project at the level of quality that I envision.",

              "text": ">Hoping regular old forums make a comeback\n\nHopefully. I've noticed a somewhat exasperating trend among younger folks with regard to Discord in that they don't seem to understand the distinction between a \"chat\" platform and a \"text forum\" type. One professional subreddit I'm a member of that's private and requires verification changed mods a couple years ago, and the new mod inexplicably decided he was deprecating the subreddit and replacing it with a Discord server. When objections were raised he admitted the lack of threads and the near impossibility of finding answers in the history was \"an issue\", but he pressed on regardless.\n\nMy personal theory is that we're seeing a generation of people who grew up with a cell phone in their hand, so their first experience of networked communication was via some sort of text message or chat app. As a result, everything on the internet, including persistent text forums like Reddit, they treat it like a chat portal. Another subreddit I'm on had a meta post suggesting that the subreddit turn off the bot that copies the body of the main post into the first comment  because \"people like to be able to delete their old posts\", completely failing to understand that the great strength and arguably the *purpose* of a persistent text forum is the ability to look back and find information. It certainly explains a lot of the question posts you see everywhere that Google would have returned the exact answer as a top result, if only they'd typed their post title into Google.",

          "text": "Our group has basically done the exact same path as yours has, and with similar conclusions. \n\nI used to host a few of Revolt (now Stoat) servers a while ago during The Great Discord Exodus Round 1.  \nThe tech stack was fragile - and looking at it again now - has made almost no visible progress. \nTheir hosted solution was unusable and broken. And I was not interested in jumping back into hosting that again either so we moved on to other options. \n\nMatrix ended up not being an option. \nThe people wanted their Emojis, Gifs, and Calls. Of all the matrix clients - none support all 3. We moved on.\n\nWe took a look at Root - but their TOS was a instant pass. We did not even try installing it. It just looks like a trap with a draconian view of users. \n\nWe're leaning on Fluxer for our future space and are currently spending a lot of time there while we see how things move. \n\nSo far - its everything we wanted with a few bugs that are getting worked out. \n\n---\n\nFor your list of wants - here's my experience with Fluxer over the last couple days: \n\n**Hard requirements:**\n\n* Discord-like Onboarding UX \n  * The experience is nearly 1:1 for Discord onboarding\n  * We re-made most of our channels and users just joined without issue. \n* Multiple text and voice chat channels\n  * Supported. \n* Decent Mobile Experience\n  * Currently only available as PWA - Mobile apps expected in 1-2 Months per the Developer chats. \n  * It's not great - but is good enough for now. \n* Self-hostable\n  * Currently yes - although opaque. \n  * Docker based Self Hosted methods are \"coming soon\"\n\n**Nice to have:**\n\n* Free and Open Source (FOSS)\n  * Yes - and public development / PR Opens should begin soon according to the Dev.\n* Minimal Vibecoding\n  * The Developer addressed this in [This blog post](https://blog.fluxer.app/how-i-built-fluxer-a-discord-like-chat-app). \n  * Their response seemed acceptable and believable to me. \n  * Using the app - it does not feel vibe-coded. \n* End-to-end Encryption\n  * Currently no - Opt-in is on the roadmap. \n  * Personal opinion - this is not actually wanted for a service like this. In concept it sounds nice. More encryption == more better right? In practice - you'll see more of the complaints of many people bitten by Matrix-style flubs where their messages disappear, or only some people can see others. For 1:1 messages, this is a good thing to have. But for large public spaces - it offers little benefit and a lot of potential for failures.\n* TTL-ed messages\n  * [Yes - for messages with files](https://fluxer.app/help/en-us/articles/1447193503661555712-how-attachment-expiry-works-on-fluxer)\n  * Semi related - A deletion clause is present in the [Privacy Policy](https://fluxer.app/privacy#7-data-retention)\n* Screensharing and video chat\n  * Yes, and does it well. Some of the larger calls I've been in had dozens of people, and many screenshares. Overall it was stable and clear. The ability to see multiple streams at once was also a nice touch. \n\n\nOur plan at the moment is to use the Fluxer.app main server - and then poll the group about whether or not to self-host once the refactor is complete. Our group is much smaller and more tight-knit so these kinds of moves are pretty easy for us. This is not meant to tell you \"Move all your users to fluxer right nao!\" - just providing some insight on my experience over the last few days, and my overall mood on the project is optimistic. \n\nRight now I'm just following the dev chats and the [Github](https://github.com/fluxerapp/fluxer) and seeing where the ride goes.",

Took a bit of poking around to get it all up and running, and it was definitely not lightweight, as mentioned. I ended up allocating a 8c 16Gb machine to get it stood up - and had some concerns about long-term stability on what's currently available in the github. It was not \"hard\", as most of what you need is in the compose. But some knowledge of initializing the databases is needed to get everything flowing. \n\nI did also chat with the Developer a bit in the Dev channels on their main server, and while they have quite a bit of work to hit the goals they've stated, they do seem achievable, especially with a little help. Overall they seemed competent, if not a little ambitious. \n\nAs far as the licencing goes - it doesn't seem too odd to me off the bat. But I also work in the FOSS space, so licencing like this is not an immediate red flag for me. You aren't wrong to be skeptical, but in my experience there are plenty of projects both small business and big that have free self-hosted models and a paid hosted option, with licences similar or equal to this. But you're correct that some caution is warranted for something so new. \n\nPersonally - I buy the premise of funding early for a \"good enough\" product to avoid external investment and solidify cashflow to develop and expand. I would be very surprised to see this be a rugpull, but I'm also not too concerned as I have very little to lose in that situation. If their plans do come to fruition I expect that I will maintain both a paid account on their main instance and a self-hosted one as well. \n\nI did buy into the membership as a sign of support for the project, and so far I feel good about that. If I end up a fool though... oh well I have made costlier mistakes. \n\nOverall though - so far so good.",

Similar to the blog author I've tried spinning up a lot of the various options and come away unimpressed with most of them, but using Fluxer feels like it's well thought out and very intentional, and doesn't give me the sense it was vibe coded (unlike many of the others).\n\nIn regards to E2EE encryption I agree with you as well, and the blog post you mention covers the developers awareness of the issues that Matrix has had with that very issue. I'd like to see a roadmap for Fluxer include E2EE (opt in) for private messages, but it's not the most pressing issue.\n\n>Our plan at the moment is to use the Fluxer.app main server - and then poll the group about whether or not to self-host once the refactor is complete. Our group is much smaller and more tight-knit so these kinds of moves are pretty easy for us. This is not meant to tell you \"Move all your users to fluxer right nao!\" - just providing some insight on my experience over the last few days, and my overall mood on the project is optimistic. \n\nSame here, spun up a test server and getting people logged into the system to make sure it works, but looking to self host once that update rolls out. The expectation here too is that Discord will still be used in parallel for things like large community servers which take much longer to figure out their move, or may even remain on Discord, but that the information you reveal to Discord is minimized to whatever you're comfortable putting on public servers.",

          "text": "I've got a matrix server that's only two days old but we've already pulled in 40 of our most active discord users and my discord server (700 users) is now a ghost town. Onboarding was relatively painless other than myself not being totally clear in my explanation of how rooms and spaces work and not realizing that users would have trouble finding rooms that aren't auto joined, in some apps. We've been digging in on the privacy and security and access control features quite heavily, and I have to say my users are extremely pleased with that aspect, and don't seem too bothered by the recovery key and multi-device verification hoops. Even the non-techies seem to consider it a completely acceptable trade-off to truly own their data, be able to speak more freely about current events and personal matters without corpo and authorities looking over their shoulder, and have privacy even from me, the admin.\n\nThe various desktop and mobile apps all have their shortcomings. None of them are as comfy and cozy as discord, and in my short hands-on experience so far, each of them seems to be lacking some feature or convenience that one of the others provides. Personally I find fluffy or schildichat the most comfortable mobile experience and element best on desktop. \n\nI have intentionally left voice and video functionality disabled for now, and intend to dig in later this week. So I can't speak to that, but I really hope that it doesn't become the downfall of what seems to be a decent little private server. We rarely use it but when we want it, it needs to be there. I don't mind doing the heavy lifting to figure it out and make it work, I'm not mad if it's extra steps or requires a bit of maintenance. I accepted that when I volunteered to host all this for the community. \n\nIt was an easy deployment overall. I spent 2 months of on and off research and dabbling on a test instance, set up in various ways including some of the docker and Helm approaches, with a non-techie friend. I started fresh about 28 hours before scheduled launch. Straight Debian packages, a lot of googling, and about 16 hours of setup, documentation and onboarding guide, and hands-on user education on a livestream, and we were rocking. I was able to onboard dozens of users in the first couple of hours, technical issues have been far more minimal than I expected, and my dread and anxiety have turned to excitement and hope.\n\nResource usage has been much lower than OP's experience. We are currently running on a 4 vCPU 8gb VPS I pay 6/mo for. I will move everything in-house after I myself have moved house, I didn't want downtime for users or extra steps to temporarily migrate to VPS while I rebuild my lab, when that happens. With 40 users we are sitting at less than 1gb RAM - and it barely budged at all when we went from 0 to 40 so I'm pretty confident it's not going to balloon when a couple hundred lurkers have come over. CPU usage has remained around 10 to 15%, only spiking when new accounts are created, not budging at all even during very active discussions and media shares.\n\nOverall I'm not 100% satisfied but it's more than good enough, to all appearances so far. My users say they feel more comfortable, more respected, less exposed, and more tightly knit than we were before. They also seem to really appreciate the work that went in, saying they feel it demonstrates I value our community, and that this experimental migration has increased our collective trust even more. \n\nSo there we have it, just my own early-days experiences. I hope everyone finds an option that works for them, to create a home for the people and the things they care about.",

It's going to be personal preference for me.\n\n\n\nMatrix - the only setup I have found that I personally like, was Mattermost. They eventually started implementing paywalls into some of their plugins that were needed for basic functioning. I liked Mattermost because of the UI, available apps and ability to expand with the use of plugins.\n\n  \nFluxer - The UI looks very similar to Discord, and as far as I have been able to tell, it looks like it'll function if not the same, very similar to Discord. The devs seem to be very engaged, and as far as I'm concerned - since Discord has announced that they will be doing the BS teen accounts, the devs seemed to have stepped it up with trying to get documentation and refactoring done as quickly as they can. That makes me feel like they care about their community.\n\nBoth are open source and great choices, but I've ran Mattermost and quit as soon as they started paywalling things, or at least the VoIP plugin I think it was. I am now locked in and waiting for Fluxer to have documentation out so that I can make that swap.\n\nMy backup plan is Root chat.",

                  "text": "Going through it I've found a couple of reasons to not use a Matrix frontend for a Discord replacement:\n\n- Ease of use for non-techies/non-power users: setup of your account and server is fairly non-intuitive, and comes with a number of decisions about where you place your home that are potentially difficult to undo or change.\n\n- E2EE failures are highly visible failures: even if they're uncommon, if you've got an active community and suddenly you can't use the space you created you're going to create distrust with the stability and viability of that platform. If you're going to use E2EE it's got to be rock solid or you risk people fleeing the platform for something that \"just works\".\n\n- Federation exposes spaces to risk: Cross contamination of content between spaces means that your hosted space could get illegal content cached on it. While federation is optional to some degree, if you're not doing it then you're missing out on the benefits of the system as a whole and may as well run something else.\n\n- Difficulty in administering federated spaces: tooling and permissions for federated spaces are limited in what you can do for your own space to limit the above risk, not because the tools aren't powerful enough but because by it's nature federation makes it difficult to manage and remove spaces. Some of the more granular settings are also somewhat opaque in what is being shared where (like federated vs. non-federated rooms within a space).\n\n- What happens when a federated space is deleted: There's a [fun blog post](https://blog.erethon.com/blog/2023/06/21/what-happens-when-a-matrix-server-disappears/) on this subject, but in that case they spun it back up and were able to get things running (with some hiccups). It seems like if a homeserver is deleted or removed (and doesn't come back), the users attached to that homeserver no longer exist. Your account is gone and you, as a user, have no way to get it back. This ties back to the first point about decisions that are hard to undo or change, one of which is where you register your homeserver.\n\nThese aren't reasons to pick Fluxer specifically, but they're why I (and my group) decided against going with a Matrix solution after doing some research and testing.",

It's much more optimized at this time, with a lightweight server being able to hold upwards of 3000 members, and the new MatrixRTC calling stack scaling to the hundreds easily.\n\nLook at Element Server Suite and also matrix-docker-ansible-deploy.\n\nIf you've tried Element in the past, that's a work/enterprise focused client even though it's historically been the reference client, and yeah, for mainstream adoption the UX just isn't there, but it wasn't designed for that either. This is why I'd recommend Commet now.\n\nFun Fact: [Rocket.Chat](http://Rocket.Chat) is also integrating Matrix-Federated communication.",

Reddit-style posts with upvotes and nested comments, and admins can flip a toggle to make individual forums publicly readable and indexable by search engines. Seems like that solves the \"information goes to die in Discord\" problem without needing a separate Discourse instance. Also building real search with operators (from:, in:, has:, before:) because Discord's search being broken is genuinely unforgivable at this point.

I had very frustrating experiences before I understood where Matrix is at in their developments. They have made a ton of changes, and that's why all these new features need Element's web client to work (a weird hybrid atm), and Element X on mobile. That's really how things are right now, but the video chat is impressive when you use the right clients. It wont always be this way.\n\nI disagree that it's \"back where we started with Discord\" because Matrix is nowhere near as mature as Discord, and if it was it wouldn't be the abomination that is.\n\nMatrix has been hard at work trying to implement features to compete with Discord. Yes, you need to use the specific clients right now, but that's no different than Discord.\n\nYou can wait for all these alpha platform projects to develop, but in that same time Matrix will get their game together.\n\nI wish you the best. Unless you shut down the Discord server completely, people will stay there. Those people are Discord people. Most of them.\n\nYou can downvote me for that opinion, I have experience with lots of large communities but I don't care to share my identity openly here.",

On the frontend, SWR handles data fetching with auto-refresh intervals.\n\nConfiguration: It's a mix. Service URLs, API keys and tokens.\n\nResources: Very lightweight. The Next.js app runs in a Docker container and sits around 80-100 MB RAM, basically no CPU unless you're loading a page.",

Sliding sync was a huge perf boost for app load times. I’ve decided it’s only good for text chat, but even with that I've self-hosted a matrix server for going on 6 years now.\n\nWould I want to deal with getting a larger group of people onto this platform? Not really. But I do like the ideology behind the app. It's just not something that I'd consider an alternative to Discord. It just checks different boxes since for me Discord is used for voice calls and screensharing.\n\nFrontends for matrix are at differing levels of parity with the backend as well so it's just a challenge to be able to bring non-technical friends into the fold.",

If you’re setting up Spacebar and looking to self-host, make sure you’ve got a solid understanding of Docker or similar containerization tools, as these often simplify deployment.

Ever since they took over a week to update for a breaking change in the last docker update (with very little communication), then they clearly rushed the update out. \n\nIt's broken in annoying ways. Like... errors aren't useful (error 500 instead of \"your compose file is malformed\"). \n\nYou have to stop an entire stack before you can do an update (used to be able to just make the change and click update, and it'd do the steps of stopping then re-deploying the stack). \n\nMy favourite thing is that you can't \"update\" a stack unless you make a change - makes logical sense, except I used to use this approach to re-pull image updates. Now i have to add or remove a space to the compose file to be able to click update and re-pull. \n\nI requested a new licence code a week ago as I got a notification mine was expiring and I have heard nothing. Last time i had to contact them to follow up on it so this isn't new. \n\nA bit disappointed. I'm giving Komodo a try and it looks pretty good so far.",
