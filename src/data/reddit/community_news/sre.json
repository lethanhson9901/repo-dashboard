If you know someone who was part of a layoff, or is anxious about future layoffs, we’re organizing a call this Sunday and we hope you can join.\n\nThe Tech Workers Coalition is hosting a mass call for laid-off workers, students, and allies on **Sunday, February 22, 11am PST / 2pm EST.**\n\nYou’ll hear from workers at Amazon and the Washington Post Tech Guild talk about their recent experiences, and share information about organizing mutual aid for vulnerable workers (including H-1B visa holders). We’ll also talk with Andrew Stettner from the National Employment Law Project about how to prepare for a layoff, with know-your rights guidance, to help navigate severance and unemployment benefits.\n\nWe’re organizing for urgent policy changes around AI and unemployment protections. The time is now to mobilize. Workers deserve to share in the prosperity that AI creates, not just bear the costs.\n\nWe hope you can join the call:\n\n[https://www.wwwrise.org](https://www.wwwrise.org/) \n\nPlease pass this forward to other people you know who might be interested! Thank you for your solidarity and support.",

Nobody really thought through what this meant for the team managing it.\nHalf our stuff runs on aws api gateway, half on gcp api gateway and they work completely differently, aws does resource policies, gcp does iam, keeping security consistent across both is genuinely impossible. When something breaks we're checking cloudwatch and cloud monitoring separately trying to figure out which platform is the problem and our devs are pissed because they had to learn two completely different systems that do the exact same thing.\nWe've probably spent more time dealing with this mess than we ever would've spent migrating off aws if we actually needed to. The ironic part is now we're stuck with both platforms instead of one so... mission accomplished I guess?\nDid anyone else do this and actually make it work or did we just completely botch the implementation?",

              "text": "Good point! And yes, synthetic monitoring is already in the list! But I think the real value isn't in synthetic monitoring by itself. It's in what feeds it.\n\nIn my experience, the workflow that actually works is: performance testing first, synthetics second. Load and stress tests are where you build your understanding of the system: you discover the breaking points, identify which components degrade first, and establish the boundary between \"this works\" and \"this doesn't.\" That knowledge is what makes synthetic monitoring useful: it tells you what to monitor and what thresholds actually matter.\n\nWithout that foundation, synthetic checks tend to be shallow: \"is the homepage responding under 2s?\" is fine, but it misses the real value. When you've done the performance testing work, you know that your checkout flow degrades when the catalog service slows down, and that the first visible symptom is the cart page taking 800ms longer to render. That's what you encode into your synthetics: a Playwright scenario that walks through browse -> add to cart -> checkout every 5 minutes, measuring each step. When that cart step drifts from 1.2s to 2s, you know something is brewing, before any user complains and before your internal metrics even cross an alerting threshold. The synthetic caught the user-facing degradation, not just the infrastructure symptom.\n\nPut differently: setting up synthetics without performance testing is an empirical approach: you pick thresholds based on intuition and hope they're meaningful. Running performance tests first turns it into a proper engineering practice: you observe, measure, understand the system's behavior under stress, and then instrument your production monitoring based on validated knowledge. Synthetics are how you operationalize what you've learned.\n\nSo I'd frame it this way: synthetic monitoring is a great operational tool for sustaining performance awareness in production, but it's not the starting point: it's downstream of a deeper performance engineering practice. The tests build the knowledge, the synthetics keep watch based on that knowledge.\n\nDoes that match how you've been thinking about it, or are you using synthetics differently?",

It can query your monitoring, pull logs, check deploy history, read runbooks, but it can't take any action. That single decision eliminates most of the trust problems people worry about.\n\nThe other thing that helps is scoping it tightly. It's not a general-purpose agent roaming your infra. It gets triggered by an alert or ticket, investigates that specific thing, and produces a summary. Fixed input, fixed output, predictable token budget.\n\nWe open sourced it if you want to poke at the approach: https://github.com/incidentfox/incidentfox",
