Fairly easy to spot due to the cluster throwing IAM errors. \n\nThey somehow ended up submitting a PR changing the OICD for EVERY SERVICE ACCOUNT in there org. SRE blocked the PR and spent the next hour trying to figure out what the hell this engineer was actually trying to do. \n\nOn of the SRE's described it as goaltending which I thought was apt. \n\nStay safe our there buddies , shits getting weird. \n\nSide note, mods we need a horror story flare .

          "text": "In my experience- Datadog has been an amazing observability tool. \n\nThe event correlation was a big deal and difference maker when reviewing their stack against others like new relic, app lnsights, signalfx and even dynatrace.  Dynatrace was actually a pretty close second imo but where they lost me is they failed to remove unused or empty data selectors from selection scope. For example - if im an Azure shop - i dont want to have to scroll past empty non-used AWS metrics and features just to find data I am ingesting and needing to filter down to. (Atleast 3ish years ago it was this way, not sure about now) + a few other small things. \nAnyway - back to the question: that quick data isolation moment in time saves time when needing to jump in quick if you didnt do the firedrill work to make those correlations or build the visibility before hand\n\nOne other piece that im quite impressed with Datadog tooling before and during an issue is how light their continuous profiler is.  Super cheap on resources and just seems to work in most cases - making it more comfortable to turn it on, let it ride in a close lower and curve some of that production inefficiency or spotting edge case bugs in production based on conditions that may not have been possible to reproduce in a lower (vendors didnt offer sandbox or test envs so production is your testing bed for feature with live traffic, not just mock data)\n\nI'm not a super huge fan of their RUM though and their syntetics could be a little more flexible. - that product suite just feels a bit clunky imo.\n\nLastly - npm has been a life saver in a k8s environment- it builds huge context into what's talking to what and can filter down pretty nicely to isolate traffic patterns so let's say \"podx is in imagepullbackoff\" - why? Well typically first thing you think is it not being able to pull its image from whatever container registry. Well I've actually caught an issue in scenarios like this where the pod was trying to hit the ACR at its public endpoint and not its private connection endpoint configure - forcing us to open up to public with restrictions to satisfy the incident, open ticket with msft and better understand the conditions which turned out to be msft side issue. - without npm in our pocket, looking at DNS queries and outbound connection attempts would have been a lot tough/slower.\n\nOthers may disagree with a few points here but they have all helped myself and my teams in their journey for reliability and they seem to win the race mostly every time. \nThey are pricey a f though nonetheless lol",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on an open-source Python tool I decided to call the **Observability Testing Tool** for Google Cloud, and I’m at a point where I’d love some community feedback before I sink more time into it.\n\n**The Problem the tool aims to solve:** I am a Google Cloud trainer and I was writing course material for an advanced observability querying/alerting course. I needed to be able to easily generate great amounts of logs and metrics for the labs. I started writing this Python tool and then realised it could probably be useful more widely. I'm thinking when needing to validate complex LQL / Log Analytics SQL / PromQL queries or when testing PagerDuty/email alerting policies for systems where \"waiting for an error\" isn't a strategy, and manually inserting log entries via the Console is tedious.\n\nI looked at tools like `flog` (which is great), but I needed something that could natively talk to the Google Cloud API, handle authentication, and generate **metrics** (Time Series data) alongside logs.\n\n**What I built:** It's a CLI tool where you define \"Jobs\" in a YAML file. It has two main modes:\n\n1. **Historical Backfill:** \"Fill the last 24 hours with error logs.\" Great for testing dashboards and retrospective queries.\n2. **Live Mode:** \"Generate a Critical error every 10 seconds for the next 5 minutes.\" Great for testing live alert triggers.\n\nIt supports variables, so you can randomize IPs or fetch real GCE metadata (like instance IDs) to make the logs look realistic.\n\n**A simple config looks like this:**\n\n    loggingJobs:\n      - frequency: \"30s ~ 1m\"\n        startTime: \"2025-01-01T00:00:00\"\n        endOffset: \"5m\"\n        logName: \"application.log\"\n        level: \"ERROR\"\n        textPayload: \"An error has occurred\"\n\nBut things can get way more complex.\n\n**My questions for you:**\n\n1. **Does this already exist?** Is there a standard tool for \"observability seeding\" on GCP that I missed? If there’s an industry standard that does this better, I’d rather contribute to that than maintain a separate tool.\n2. **Is this a real pain point?** Do you find yourselves wishing you had a way to \"generate noise\" on demand? Or is the standard \"deploy and tune later\" approach usually good enough for your teams?\n3. **How would you actually use it?** Where would a tool like this fit in your workflow? Would you use it manually, or would you expect to put it in a CI pipeline to \"smoke test\" your monitoring stack before a rollout?\n\n**Repo is here:** [https://github.com/fmestrone/observability-testing-tool](https://github.com/fmestrone/observability-testing-tool)\n\n**Overview article on medium.com:** [https://blog.federicomestrone.com/dont-wait-for-an-outage-stress-test-your-google-cloud-observability-setup-today-a987166fcd68](https://blog.federicomestrone.com/dont-wait-for-an-outage-stress-test-your-google-cloud-observability-setup-today-a987166fcd68)\n\nThanks for roasting my code (or the idea)! 😀",

We can be surprised by a sudden uptick in unique values used on already approved tags.  (side note, in QA/test environments tags/labels are essentially unique value rate limited so they can be actively developed without approval).\n\nSo our causes tend to be new services launching using existing tags/labels that increase cardinality.  Sudden spikes on logs for services that don't use sampling (we have a few.. it's usually actually loadtests, not production, that have gone sideways/spiraled out of control).\n\nWe do use some host based vendor monitoring as well, and someone accidentally deploying/activating hosts for monitoring can be another cause.\n\nIn all cases we have monitors/alerts that catch unexpected rate changes within minutes to hours depending on the type of cost and within 24/48 hours we've worked out containment. Our team has authority to immediately block/disable any high cost monitoring that lacks approval or we can't find the owner of as well. \n\nBy catching all cost issues within 12-24 hours we rarely have a surprise bill/cost.",

As such, we're creating a survey to see how you feel about modifying the rules around there.\n\nAdditionally, we're seeing *lots* of reports on promotional content and posts that seem to be farming for feedback to improve products. The survey will cover these as well.\n\nPlease see that here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds751nKsP3nb1lFOiAdkwXVtmAO2e4rzuPGNJ9y9gZ-ksZ7A/viewform?usp=dialog](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds751nKsP3nb1lFOiAdkwXVtmAO2e4rzuPGNJ9y9gZ-ksZ7A/viewform?usp=dialog)\n\n# What Topics Would You Like to See More?\n\nWe’re always looking to make the subreddit more useful and relevant to you. Let us know what topics you’d like to see more of.

I wouldn't say the community is completely dead, but organic posts get drowned in noise. I'm not even talking about quality posts (which, frankly, I don't remember seeing many of), just something that isn't generated by an LLM or fishing for engagement with low-effort slop. I don't know how this sub became a bot honeypot considering it's not even that active, but logic clearly isn't a constraint for people engaging in such practices.\n\nThe user/post/comment statistics are misleading and could be (and probably are) bots. Out of ten random posts at least five will be bots talking to each other trying to sell something (revolutionary idea of an incident management platform with AI insights).\n\nKarma/account age requirements should at least put out the fire.\n\n> Although against the rules, there seems to be a lot of engagement with posts asking for interview prep advice and how to get into SRE.\n\nI don't want to be rude, but this is a bad thing and a clear failure on the moderation side.

That is presumably why the rule exists in the first place.\n\n> What Topics Would You Like to See More?\n\nI would like to see anything that's not breaking rule #2.

Recruiting outside of American time zones is quite difficult.\n\nRelying primarily on user reports feels analogous to relying on customer complaints instead of implementing monitoring. Given a churn of 5–6 posts per day, options like scheduled posting freezes or manual approval seem ok to me.\n\nI don't follow the sub extremely closely (though probably more than most, since I follow only a small set of smaller subs), but I don't recall seeing a call for additional moderators; may explain the recruiting difficulty.

The posts I listed above are still up - I don't know whether that was a conscious decision or simply a matter of time, but I would have removed them regardless of engagement, even if it resulted in a completely empty feed. Likewise, I wouldn't [have added a \"HORROR STORY\" flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/1qbd255/new_term_claude_hole/nzduuvb/) to honor a shitpost.\n\nSRE is a technical discipline. It's reasonable to expect that people are interested in anything that helps them do that job better. Your proposed topic list is good, and everything in the Google workbooks clearly belongs. I also think \"reliability engineering\" is already a sufficiently precise framing - e.g. it's far narrower than DevOps. At its core, SRE is about measuring reliability and doing the work required to bring it to an acceptable standard. Anything that supports that goal belongs; anything that doesn't probably doesn't.",

I was basically an SRE but didn't have the title.  \n\nBefore I separated from the company I was working on implementing istio/opentelemetry/prometheus/graphana/tempo and integrating with JIRA and Gitlab \n\nIt was just in the design phase but the systems where there GKE/AWS test clusters running our platform so I had plenty of data to build this out.\n\nSo now all I have is my home lab and I want to build it out so I can test and improve my design.  Also buff up on my Python as we didn't really use it.  \n\nIs there such a thing that just runs in the cluster and produces logs, simulates issues including OOMs/pod restarts/etc so you can test/rate your design?\n\nThanks for any info.",
