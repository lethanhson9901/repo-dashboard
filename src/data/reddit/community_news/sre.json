(K8S, GCP, GH Actions, ArgoCD, APIs and proxies, as well as decent amount of Java).\n\nMy question for you is: how do I know whether I’d be a good candidate for this kind of job?

Ops, or just Sysadmin.\n\nthis role is heavily focused on SWE, so you must have software development experience because you will be working with Devs constantly, and building solutions for them. You need to know how production grade apps should be built and how the code should be written, tested, published and deployed.\n\nwhat you described seems like a good fit for the role.

There would be random situations where the service scaled up to max pods, and then magically recover a few minutes later. So instead of 3 of a thing with autoscaling up and down as customer demand rose and fell over a day we were running 50 minimum just to reduce the odds of sympathetic failures. With my fix in place the service stopped doing that and I was able to lower min back to a sane level.\n\nThese settings had been in place for years, after being repeatedly copypasta'd from a proof of concept; when I first asked our staff+ engineer about it he insisted the settings were mandatory to achieve a 100% latency SLO and closed the PR. I had to wait for him to quit to revisit this. Now the monthly operational review metrics look better, costs are down and paging events are down.\n\nOh, and also my manager got promoted and reassigned me to another team, who immediately put me on loan to a third team.

                  "text": "> Good job! If you don't mind, how did you find the root cause?\n\nI'd been looking at it for a long time, and then one of the core committers on our OSS load-balancer tech mentioned that retry config was really request hedging, and that had me looking at the settings:\n\n1. 4 simultaneous retries\n2. The smallest possible exponential backoff\n3. A request hedging deadline of like 10 percent more than average request time\n\nAll those seemed bad and wrong for the particular service in question. In particular exponential backoff with jitter is intended to cure the exact problem we encountered. I'd also been studying facebook engineering's metastable failure concepts and retry logic was one of the examples I'd seen in the literature, so it was on my radar to review.\n\nWhen I went looking for the PR & associated analysis for the settings was when I realized they hadn't changed since pure guesswork was used in demo / proof of concept. So with the most senior engineer leaving the company to start his own, and the second most out on paternity leave, I was able to push through the change as an experiment to prove it doesn't impact latency SLOs and in fact improves reliability outcomes. \"Science progresses one funeral at a time.\"\n\n> Regarding the team changes, does that occur a lot in FAANG? Is that much of a pain or are you happy working on different stuff with different people? \n\nIn my observations it happens every time a manager leaves or gets promoted. There is no succession planning, only succession emergency responses. I was actually pretty lucky to join the company right as a manager got promoted into his new job, so the time under one manager was longer than typical. My new team has had like 5 managers in 8 years.\n\nBut it's a huge pain, because of how promotions work. I've been asking for a promotion for years now, and knew getting reassigned was a death knell in the first year; getting me a promotion would come at the cost of his other staff he started the year with. But the real pain was the annual review: \"I agree you're already performing at the next level, but unfortunately the next level promotion requires upper management approval and a cross-functional project and I don't have any of those, so don't expect a promotion.\"\n\nWorse, my last cross functional project fell apart. The first month I joined, the SWE leading the project took a month off work. When she came back the ML engineer we needed announced his retirement in two months. The EPM technically assigned was a no-show (\"focused on other high priority projects\"), and the aforementioned SWE was clearly underwater from the number of new technologies the project was adopting. So I had basically no usable system to evaluate as an SRE. Even the junior engineer assigned to implement Prometheus metrics quit the company.\n\n> Also, are people mostly excellent, with good mindset, or is it like in any company with plenty of cruise-along folks?\n\nAbout half of my peers seem to be rest-and-vest. It's so bad in some places that some managers responded to the \"3 day return to office\" mandate by requiring monday and friday to be in office just to stop people from doing stealth 4 day weekends. But given that I appear to be permanently sidelined, I might join their cause. Or just retire on all the money I've already made, and catch up on my steam backlog.\n\nThere are plenty of good people doing good work. One or two of them might even be able to do good work and maintain work-life balance. And for key \"an executive will be fired if this doesn't ship\" initiatives, there's plenty of work being done.",

The person most directly responsible for budgeting and cost reporting appears to have been fired without a replacement, and upper leadership is more concerned about AI training costs and deliverables. My new manager was impressed but not too impressed since it's not his budget.\n\nThe new group I'm supporting is an internal tool, so it has an annual cloud spend so low that it would take a 100% cost reduction to match the result. So I've mostly been focused on improving their alerting, outage detection and CI situation. They are also rudderless when it comes to finops; but due to reorgs that happened last month at the highest level I'm not about to press the issue.",

SRE-SWE takes the same interviews as SWE do, and can transfer between SRE and SWE without technical interviews, something that SE-SRE, i.e. Systems Engineer SRE can't do.\n\nI've been invited to interview for a Meta PE role, but I'm not sure if it's a good fit: it looks like there's a lot of low-level Linux / kernel / networking questions asked, whereas I'm more of a software person. I'm interested in the low-level stuff too and I'm happy to learn it, it's just not where I excel at, and at Google, unless you're working on a team that's specifically dealing the network, disk servers, or low-level Borg teams, you're going to be doing things at the application layer. I can't remember a time when I SSH'ed into a production server once in my whole time there.\n\nAre there different kinds of Production Engineers at Meta? Do they all take the same kind of interview?\n\n  \nEDIT: Thanks everyone for the replies. Looks like I won't be applying to Meta :).",

The role has to fit into the culture and org to be effective. Facebook/Meta was more adhoc and flexible, Google has always been structured and organized (and mired in process).\n\nNeither is better than the other, it's ultimately about whether you're optimizing for rate of change and failing fast, or optimizing for slower, methodical, higher quality change (that may never actually ship).\n\nOn the systems and network interviews: this may be the gray beard talking, but IMO if you can't pass them, you probably shouldn't be an SRE at Google.

What the day-to-day looks like depends on the team and the individual. Personally, I spend a large percentage of my time writing design docs and code, and I don't think that is going to change anytime soon. I have been able to avoid teams that view PE as SRE because I want to work on big problems—not just reliability and scalability. This has allowed me to build new services, work on product features, and generally operate as a member of the SWE team. All of this is a long way of saying that many PE teams don’t actually work on low-level systems (or really need to be low-level experts); they only need to be able to function higher in the stack.",

Some ex-Googlers love it, others bounce because the role is closer to “systems engineer with software skills” than “software engineer with reliability focus.” If low-level systems isn’t where you naturally shine or want to spend most of your energy, trusting your instinct to pass is reasonable.",

          "text": "I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately (and I’ve talked about it on Ship It Weekly a few times if you want the longer version).\n\nMy take: AI is going to change SRE/DevOps work a ton, but it’s not going to “replace SRE” in the way people imagine.\n\nWhat I think actually happens over the next 5 years… AI becomes a force multiplier for the parts of the job that are already semi-repeatable: writing Terraform/Helm boilerplate, generating runbooks, summarizing incidents, translating logs into hypotheses, suggesting mitigations, spotting patterns across metrics/traces/logs, even drafting postmortems and PRs.\nBut the hard parts don’t go away… deciding what’s safe, what’s actually happening in prod, what to roll back vs roll forward, how to limit blast radius, how to design guardrails, how to handle weird edge cases, and how to balance risk/cost/latency/business tradeoffs. That’s still human accountability, especially during an incident when “kinda right” is still wrong.\n\nSo I don’t expect a big reduction in SRE/DevOps jobs. I expect job expectations to shift… Less time spent on grunt work, more time spent on judgment, architecture, incident command, and making systems “AI-operable” (good telemetry, clean deploy patterns, strong rollback, safe automation).\nProbably fewer entry-level roles, because AI covers a lot of what juniors used to do. But that creates a pipeline problem later if companies stop training people up.\n\nIf you want my longer ramble, I covered it here:\n\nhttps://www.tellerstech.com/ship-it-weekly/ship-it-interviews-the-why-behind-devops-upskilling-and-agentic-ai-with-maz-islam/\n\nand a few weekly episodes:\n\nhttps://www.tellerstech.com/ship-it-weekly/fail-small-iac-control-planes-and-automated-rca/\n\nhttps://www.tellerstech.com/ship-it-weekly/github-runner-pricing-pause-terraform-cloud-limits-and-ai-in-ci/\n\nhttps://www.tellerstech.com/ship-it-weekly/kubernetes-shake-ups-platform-reality-and-ai-native-sre/\n\nEdit: Also Matt Garman (AWS CEO) weighed in on this: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/uncanny-valley-wired/id266391367?i=1000741507040",

Took about an hour to build, even with manual style changes. \n\nI could have built it by hand, but it would have taken considerably longer and been more frustrating.\n\nI don’t see actual jobs being replaced just yet, as it just cannot make decisions like humans can, but as an augment to my job, it’s pretty amazing.\n\nI reckon the hype will die down a bit and all the companies that have a hard on for AI will realise it ain’t gonna solve all their problems, so it’ll just end up being another tool to add to our collective arsenal.

In some companies coding is more around tooling and observability, in others they want you to do IaC, and lastly some want SRE to fix bad app code. I believe its just too broad of a spectrum. But definitely SRE knows coding and its best practices for reliability, and should be involved in design, and at least review so developers know where to focus and why so their app is more reliable. Another big role is to guard error budget so delivery speed moves with customer experience. But again.. I believe it's just a bit too much for one role and I would prefer if it split, even if it's more expensive.",

The real understanding of how our systems work lives in tribal knowledge, scattered runbooks, and disconnected blog posts.\n\nWe talk about concepts like continuous deployment, reliability, and platforms, but rarely write down the actual mechanisms. What is really happening, why it works, and where it breaks.\n\nI started building The Practitioner as a forcing function to make myself explain these systems clearly. You cannot hand wave through ideas like deployment or reliability when you have to describe the full chain from git init to production traffic.\n\nThe site combines a knowledge base, coding tutorials, and a blog. It focuses on first principles and system behavior rather than specific tools.\n\nIt is early and still evolving, but if you are interested in production engineering mental models, I would appreciate any feedback.\n\n[https://thepractitioner.cloud](https://thepractitioner.cloud)",

In some tickets and PRs we associate the application name to the change which makes it really easy to identify an ongoing alert related to an app to a recent change. \n\nIf we can’t find recent anything in recent changes, then we fallback to tools like APM (opentelemetry) to understand what’s happening and investigate from there.",

In my personal opinion, the only things you can basically do is either reduce the number of hops or invest into preventative measures. Reducing the number of hops is often not necessarily something under your control or makes economical sense, so the thing that remains is preventative stuff, like:\n\n - Automatic canarying + rollback  \n - Client throttling + Load shedding  \n - Graceful degradation  \n - Autoscaling  \n - etc...\n\nAll this of course also carries a cost but I'd argue it's more future-proof and sustainable and investing time in reactive stuff.",

Say you want to build something that hooks into your deployment mechanism to log actions in some place you an then show in oncall response. Now the fractal of problems starts to open up, because it could also be in a dependent service, or it could be a bad config change or similar. So you have to go figure those out and how to present them while still preserving a good signal to noise ratio (Like what's the point of showing deployments and config changes across everything, that's just going to lead to more confusion).\n\nSo instead of doing that work and getting a dashboard as a result, build the canary and auto rollback based on the metrics you would otherwise alert on into those rollouts and config update mechanisms you're investigating for this.\n\nWhat you built now is something that avoids getting paged in the first place and instead you have to deal with an autorollback where it tells you what metric went bad, and you can investigate in peace and quiet.",

Someone gets paged, they ack it, and then they're staring at an alert that says \"high error rate on checkout service\" with no idea if its a new deploy, a dependency issue, or just Black Friday traffic patterns doing something weird. We'd lose 10-15 minutes just getting oriented.\n\nWhat actually moved the needle for us was investing heavily in runbooks that are linked directly from alerts, not living in some separate wiki nobody remembers to check at 3am. The key was making them specific enough to be useful but not so detailed they become outdated instantly. Like instead of \"investigate checkout errors\" we'd have \"checkout error rate > 2% - first check payment gateway status page, then recent deploys in last 2hrs, then db connection pool metrics.\" Giving the on-call person a clear first three places to look saved so much fumbling around.\n\nThe other thing that helped way more than I expected was having strong service ownership. When everyone knows exactly who owns what, you're not wasting time in Slack asking \"hey does anyone know about the inventory sync service\" while customers are getting errors. Its like mise en place in cooking honestly, all that boring prep work of documenting ownership and keeping it current pays off massively when things go sideways.",

I'd like something my team can use that has:\n\n\\- Reasonable and transparent pricing\n\n\\- Runbook automation included (PagerDuty makes you have an Business/Enterprise account to have the privilege of paying an additional $130+ per user/month)\n\n\\- Preferably built in integrations with UptimeRobot and Zabbix\n\n\\- Auto alert resolution\n\n\\- De duplication of alerts / incident merging\n\nI have scheduled demos with Alertops and Rootly as they seem promising. I have also seen SquadCast and Pagertree but would like to hear thoughts.",

          "text": "not sure if anyone that used Pagerduty knows it, but here is a VERY frustrating bug that was driving us crazy (and was one of the triggers that made us to move out after the conversation with them, see that bellow):  \n\\- **If your service in Pagerduty is not covered by oncall 24/7 and an alert arrives - Pagerduty does a \"preflight\" check and if the service does not have anyone currently oncall, then the incoming event/alert is just dropped on their end without ANY information on the service page.** So literally, if for example you have oncall configured 9-5 for some small subset of services and the alert for that service comes in at 5:01, then NOTHING on Pagerduty will say that there was an alert triggered. Not the next day. Not even a message on the service page to say that it was dropped because nobody was on-call. Not in settings. Not anywhere. Just NOTHING.  \nAnd the shittiest part - after we communicated this issue to Pagerduty, they said that it is not a bug, but a feature and they are not gonna change that, but \"here is another paid tool that can inform you when you dont have 24/7 oncall coverage for a service\". Oh.. so nice of you! No, thanks! One of the examples why we need it working - In Europe (at least in our company) you cant just randomly put people 24/7 oncall for everything you want. Whenever some new team that owns a microservice joins the 24/7 oncall, then there are legal steps that should be involved for each person that joins 24/7 oncall - smth called \"work contract addendum\", therefore we leverage office hours oncall for lower service tiers and microservices that are on the early stage of development and leaving 24/7 oncall only for the highest tier critical services (customer facing). I know that we can use second/third/fourth level in the escalation path that can keep the oncall for any service, but NONE of our lowest tier services should page anyone during the night (that is the internal rule and I totally agree with it). The development team should handle any errors the next business day and also have the possibility to be paged directly if the issue happens only during office hours.",

It also allows fixed script execution for the responders, so they can run the Automation from within PagerDuty or sometimes your ITSM tooling i think. \nYou can do most of it by doing what you suggest but it would require logins to rundeck as well and relying on manual intervention",

It just helps you stay calm and systematic when things are broken.\n\nWhat it does\n\n\t•\tGuides you through incident triage step by step\n\n\t•\tSuggests common checks and commands for typical production issues\n\n\t•\tHelps capture notes and timelines during incidents\n\n\t•\tWorks locally, no cloud dependency\n\nI built it mainly for myself, then cleaned it up and open sourced it in case others find it useful.\n\nGitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/malikyawar/incident-helper\n\nFeedback, issues, or ideas are welcome.

Because Google is anti-remote you will need to be near one of those offices.\n\n3) Very flexible. SRE-SWE is on the SWE ladder. You can move around teams reasonably easily.\n\nI don't know about transfer to India. Remember that Google will reset your pay to local pay levels if you move to a new office.",

The first 3 were at a startup where I had to do a little bit of everything: data, fullstack, infra, product, etc etc.\n\nI found infra interesting, so I took an SRE position at a more mature startup where the infra team was also doing production code for both internal and external capabilities. However, earlier last year there was some restructuring at the VP/lead level, and shortly thereafter our team basically stopped doing any software engineering or coding. The services and tools we maintained were transferred to other teams or changed to third party vendors.\n\nNowadays we mostly just do ClickOps, write YAML files, and bash scripts for GHA, and I’ve recently realized I’m bored out of my mind and have no interest in any of the upcoming projects for our team's roadmap.\n\nSo what I wanted to ask y'all was: is coding common in SRE roles and I just had bad luck, or is this the current state of SRE?  Should I just go back to backend/fullstack roles if i want to keep on coding?",

I move up from being help desk, to tier 3, to junior ops then new management came in and got prompted to SRE. Now my entire IT background was customer support rather it be general IT, to networking (physically running network cables, install network access) to software support to now this. \n\nHowever I want to be the best i can and right now im just a very good troubleshooter but when it comes down to serious issues im useless. I only know basic level of linux, getting better at AWS and doing minor code changes to help me learn coding and software engineering.\n\nI been looking into lookimg into getting a degree in computer science but neither my boss or my two very good senior SRE coworkers have any degree. So I dont know what I should do. Focus on learning linux, git, python, typescript as self taught or go pay thousands to get a degree. \n\nI been doing a little bit of boot.dev and it pretty good but not sure if that that best place to start. I cannot read code fluently as we use many languages at my company. Php, typescript, bash, JS, python. Now what got me to this position is im very good on the software were creating. Troubleshooting issues with our customers, fixing complex issue (customer side and backend side) but I almost feel like I get lucky.\n\nSo for those who are an SRE I would love to know your opinions on where I should start and best course to help me in the long run.\n\nThank you for your time.",

As someone who actually keeps up with ai unlike my colleagues I’ve come to the realisation my role is pretty much automated using Claude code. The new browser plugin can manually go through apps and has complete access to network traffic allowing it to generate non trivial performance test scripts in any language. \n\nI pointed this out on the QA subreddit and got pretty negative reaction. Personally my job is only safe for few years due to archaic practises and adoption lag at my bloated f500 company. \n\nWhat would you do in my situation? I’m attempting to move into the SRE team now.

These become top priority since whatever upper-management wants done is always top priority.\n* There's also usually some triage done to determine what's actually an \"action item\" and what's a \"project\"\n   * It's really easy for someone to say \"we need to do/fix X\" during a post-mortem. But doing/fixing X might be months of work for one or more teams\n   * In those cases they stop being action items and become projects put on a roadmap and prioritized like anything else\n\nThe reality of course is that smaller action items tend to slip into the backlog until/unless they cause another incident. Most teams are under-staffed and over-burdened so it's generally expected that most things that hit a team's backlog will probably never get done until there's some forcing function to do them.",
