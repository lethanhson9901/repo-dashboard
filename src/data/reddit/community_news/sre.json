If you know someone who was part of a layoff, or is anxious about future layoffs, we’re organizing a call this Sunday and we hope you can join.\n\nThe Tech Workers Coalition is hosting a mass call for laid-off workers, students, and allies on **Sunday, February 22, 11am PST / 2pm EST.**\n\nYou’ll hear from workers at Amazon and the Washington Post Tech Guild talk about their recent experiences, and share information about organizing mutual aid for vulnerable workers (including H-1B visa holders). We’ll also talk with Andrew Stettner from the National Employment Law Project about how to prepare for a layoff, with know-your rights guidance, to help navigate severance and unemployment benefits.\n\nWe’re organizing for urgent policy changes around AI and unemployment protections. The time is now to mobilize. Workers deserve to share in the prosperity that AI creates, not just bear the costs.\n\nWe hope you can join the call:\n\n[https://www.wwwrise.org](https://www.wwwrise.org/) \n\nPlease pass this forward to other people you know who might be interested! Thank you for your solidarity and support.",

Nobody really thought through what this meant for the team managing it.\nHalf our stuff runs on aws api gateway, half on gcp api gateway and they work completely differently, aws does resource policies, gcp does iam, keeping security consistent across both is genuinely impossible. When something breaks we're checking cloudwatch and cloud monitoring separately trying to figure out which platform is the problem and our devs are pissed because they had to learn two completely different systems that do the exact same thing.\nWe've probably spent more time dealing with this mess than we ever would've spent migrating off aws if we actually needed to. The ironic part is now we're stuck with both platforms instead of one so... mission accomplished I guess?\nDid anyone else do this and actually make it work or did we just completely botch the implementation?",

      "text": "Saw a team recently share a breakdown of a 47-minute checkout outage that could have been caught much earlier. Thought it was worth summarizing because a lot of people here ask what application monitoring metrics actually matter. The issue started with checkout services returning 500s around 2am. Initial investigation focused on CPU and memory at the pod level. Everything looked healthy from an infrastructure perspective, which ended up being a distraction. Once traces were reviewed, it became clear that payment gateway calls were timing out at the default 30s. The root cause turned out to be an expired certificate on an upstream dependency.\n\n\n\nWhat reportedly helped identify the issue:\n\n\\- A service map that immediately showed the payment gateway dependency in a degraded or red state\n\n\\- A p99 latency dashboard that spiked from about 200ms to 30s\n\n\\- Distributed traces showing the exact span where requests were hanging\n\n\n\nWhat did not help:\n\n\\- Basic infra metrics. CPU and memory looked fine throughout\n\n\\- Alerting configured only around error rates crossing 5%\n\n\n\nOne takeaway from the discussion was that infrastructure level health can look completely normal while user-facing latency is collapsing because of a dependency. The team is now adding dependency-specific health checks, defining SLOs for upstream services, and lowering error rate alert thresholds. Curious what others keep on their war room dashboards during incidents. Are you prioritizing latency percentiles, dependency maps, synthetic checks, something else? It seems like a lot of monitoring setups still focus heavily on infrastructure signals rather than service-to-service behavior.\n\n",

Also curious how you define error budgets when the platform owner controls most dependencies.",

They have all the way up to the big enterprise organizations that just don’t understand what they’re doing with AI and they don’t have the right talent in place to help them do it in a safe way.\n\n",
