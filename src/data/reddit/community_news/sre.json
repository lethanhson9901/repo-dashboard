      "text": "I’m looking at our current on-call process and realized how much time we’re losing to manual triage.\n\nThe biggest issue is when an incident hits after-hours. Usually, someone has to wake up, and they have to check if a Slack alert matches an email from a high-priority client, look up the service owner, and then decide whether to escalate it or let it wait until morning.\n\nIt feels like most of this logic is straightforward (Severity + Client Tier + Service Impact), yet we’re still using a person to do the routing.\n\nHas anyone successfully automated the \"decision layer\" between the incoming signal (Email/Slack/PagerDuty) and the actual response (Jira ticket/Escalation)? Or is the risk of an automated system mis-categorizing a P0 issue still too high to trust?\n\nAm I missing some tool, or do other people feel this pain too?",

If you are unable to resolve the issue, create a slack channel for the incident and invite those who need to be in there and be sure to keep all conversations in that channel, this will help when you write up your RCA.",

How long a client can wait an answer.\n\nBasically, key in this is having a general view in a single location and trust in the systems deployed and configured. Of course, this trust is based on many years of monitoring systems (network, servers, private and public cloud services, etc.) and we found in checkmk the flexibility to monitor and alert properly since it's begginings (more than 16 years ago).\n\n",

It’s an AI-driven pager with an orchestrator that sits across Slack, email, Jira, monitoring tools, etc., and decides *who* to page and *when* based on severity, service impact, customer tier, and past incidents.\n\nThe big thing for us was keeping everything dead simple for on-call. No new dashboard - the AI agent lives in Slack. It acks alerts, explains why it’s paging (or not), escalates if there’s no response, spins up the incident channel, and keeps Jira updated. Humans can override anytime, but most teams start by letting it handle after-hours triage and go from there.\n\nSo yeah, this pain is real, and the logic really is straightforward - it just shouldn’t require a half-awake human anymore",

The solution is **data enrichment** via service labels and tags: the key is to stop treating every host the same way.\n\nInstead of forcing an operator to decide if a client is 'High Priority' in the middle of the night, you should store that information directly in Checkmk using **labels**. This allows you to build extremely granular notification rules: if the system already knows the client tier and service criticality, the notification is triggered (or suppressed) with the correct escalation level automatically.\n\nAdditionally, you can use Checkmk’s **Business Intelligence (BI)** to map dependencies. This way, if a database goes down, the system automatically understands that 'Customer Service X' is impacted. The result? You get a single high-priority notification focused on the service availability, rather than 10 separate technical alerts that someone has to manually correlate.",

Oh look, the cache entry expiration time is one hour, there's a single entry that accounts for 50% of all queries, and that particular entry takes 500msec to compute on a cache miss. So when that entry expires, 50% of all queries are cache misses for half a second. If we precompute that one entry and stuff it into the cache before it expires, we can get rid of that weird traffic spike on the backends. More generally, we should do that for the top N queries anyway; there's no point in ever having those be a cache miss.\"",
