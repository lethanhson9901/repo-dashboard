Or is the risk of an automated system mis-categorizing a P0 issue still too high to trust?\n\nAm I missing some tool, or do other people feel this pain too?",

It’s an AI-driven pager with an orchestrator that sits across Slack, email, Jira, monitoring tools, etc., and decides *who* to page and *when* based on severity, service impact, customer tier, and past incidents.\n\nThe big thing for us was keeping everything dead simple for on-call. No new dashboard - the AI agent lives in Slack. It acks alerts, explains why it’s paging (or not), escalates if there’s no response, spins up the incident channel, and keeps Jira updated. Humans can override anytime, but most teams start by letting it handle after-hours triage and go from there.\n\nSo yeah, this pain is real, and the logic really is straightforward - it just shouldn’t require a half-awake human anymore",

How long a client can wait an answer.\n\nBasically, key in this is having a general view in a single location and trust in the systems deployed and configured. Of course, this trust is based on many years of monitoring systems (network, servers, private and public cloud services, etc.) and we found in checkmk the flexibility to monitor and alert properly since it's begginings (more than 16 years ago).\n\n",

The solution is **data enrichment** via service labels and tags: the key is to stop treating every host the same way.\n\nInstead of forcing an operator to decide if a client is 'High Priority' in the middle of the night, you should store that information directly in Checkmk using **labels**. This allows you to build extremely granular notification rules: if the system already knows the client tier and service criticality, the notification is triggered (or suppressed) with the correct escalation level automatically.\n\nAdditionally, you can use Checkmk’s **Business Intelligence (BI)** to map dependencies. This way, if a database goes down, the system automatically understands that 'Customer Service X' is impacted. The result? You get a single high-priority notification focused on the service availability, rather than 10 separate technical alerts that someone has to manually correlate.",

Orgs I worked for did not have any SLO defined and the idea around monitoring a service was that it \"should be up as much as possible\". Things usually were driven by dev and what they wanted to do and SRE was more of the Ops team of old days with fancy tooling and new designations. For the most part I have seen titles like \"devops engineer\" and \"SRE\" used interchangeably for the person who does everything, you are the guy who gets the pager, you are the guy who has to deal with whims and fancies of devs, you are the guy with too much responsibility and almost always low autonomy. \n\nI have been applying for jobs lately and every company I have interviewed with do not have a dedicated release team, SREs are supposed to be doing everything, I don't see the practice of error budgets being applied for release. Most of these \"SRE\" roles do not do any value add but simply do reactive response work and firefighting, babysitting systems instead of changing things, needless to say such places get political in no time.\n\nI'd like to hear from others in the industry, do you have release work and reliability work divided in your org? How much autonomy does your org provide? Does SRE have technical say? Do devs listen? Can SRE negotiate?\n\nIs this the \"industry norm\" or I'm just unlucky?",

With duplicated I mean that I see 50+ spans coming in with the identical timestamp, trace id, span id, endpoint ...\n\nI am trying to figure out where that duplication might come from. I can only imagine that it has to do with a strange OTel Collector setup where the collector is resending the same span - or - where the OTel setup is load balancing data and multiple OTel collectors therefore end up sending the same data. Whats still odd though that I have so many duplicated spans\n\nHere a screenshot of my query that shows the number of duplicated spans.\n\nBesides my two reasons above - is there any other scenario where duplicated spans would be sent?

Most companies fundamentally, SRE is still software engineering. You’re writing production code, building tooling, automating systems, and dealing with real scale and failure modes. The main shift is what you optimize for. SWE is usually feature velocity and product, SRE is reliability, uptime, performance, and making sure things don’t fall over at 3am.\n\nI’ve seen plenty of people go both directions without issue. Honestly, having SRE experience can make you uniquely positioned as a SWE if you do decide to transition due to AI as well. \n\nFun fact - this experience is what led to what I do now in AI SRE space.",

We installed Acunetix for this and we run it once a day on all our critical apps. \n\nWe integrated the checks directly into our deployment pipeline. If there has been a successful scan in the last 30 days, the deployment is authorized to go up to production, if not it’s blocked after the preproduction deployment. At this step, it shows the developer the results and they can work on fixing it and retriggering a scan.",
