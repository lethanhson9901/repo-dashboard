Fairly easy to spot due to the cluster throwing IAM errors. \n\nThey somehow ended up submitting a PR changing the OICD for EVERY SERVICE ACCOUNT in there org. SRE blocked the PR and spent the next hour trying to figure out what the hell this engineer was actually trying to do. \n\nOn of the SRE's described it as goaltending which I thought was apt. \n\nStay safe our there buddies , shits getting weird. \n\nSide note, mods we need a horror story flare .

I’m no longer getting meaningful salary increases, and my role feels more like “keeping things running” than moving forward in my career. I did some scripting early in my career, but for the past 8 years it’s mostly been operational and platform work.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation ,hitting a salary ceiling?\n\nWhat did you do to break out of it?\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing how others navigated this stage of their career.",

It gets annoying, particularly as a father. It forces my wife to have to do even more work during my on-call shifts, as it makes me unreliable. I can't commit to picking up the kid from school or activities because I can't be sure I won't be in the middle of an incident.\n\n\nWeirdly I enjoy actually handling pages. I don't dread finding out what has paged me, I get excited to go figure it out.  I'm very strongly problem motivated, if you throw a set of problems at me that I've got the skills to start tackling, I'm happy as can be. Doubly so if it means I get a chance to learn something.  A page is just a fresh challenge.  The flip side of that is I get extremely pissed off by false positive alarms, because I go in to the situation expecting a problem only to find nothing!\n\n\nI've been on-call in one form or another for approaching 20 years now, so it's not like the experience is new or novel either. ",

I wouldn't say the community is completely dead, but organic posts get drowned in noise. I'm not even talking about quality posts (which, frankly, I don't remember seeing many of), just something that isn't generated by an LLM or fishing for engagement with low-effort slop. I don't know how this sub became a bot honeypot considering it's not even that active, but logic clearly isn't a constraint for people engaging in such practices.\n\nThe user/post/comment statistics are misleading and could be (and probably are) bots. Out of ten random posts at least five will be bots talking to each other trying to sell something (revolutionary idea of an incident management platform with AI insights).\n\nKarma/account age requirements should at least put out the fire.\n\n> Although against the rules, there seems to be a lot of engagement with posts asking for interview prep advice and how to get into SRE.\n\nI don't want to be rude, but this is a bad thing and a clear failure on the moderation side. Of course these posts get engagement - anyone can chime in with generic advice, and they are broadly relevant for everyone. That is presumably why the rule exists in the first place.\n\n> What Topics Would You Like to See More?\n\nI would like to see anything that's not breaking rule #2.

The posts I listed above are still up - I don't know whether that was a conscious decision or simply a matter of time, but I would have removed them regardless of engagement, even if it resulted in a completely empty feed. Likewise, I wouldn't [have added a \"HORROR STORY\" flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/1qbd255/new_term_claude_hole/nzduuvb/) to honor a shitpost.\n\nSRE is a technical discipline. It's reasonable to expect that people are interested in anything that helps them do that job better. Your proposed topic list is good, and everything in the Google workbooks clearly belongs. I also think \"reliability engineering\" is already a sufficiently precise framing - e.g. it's far narrower than DevOps. At its core, SRE is about measuring reliability and doing the work required to bring it to an acceptable standard. Anything that supports that goal belongs; anything that doesn't probably doesn't.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on an open-source Python tool I decided to call the **Observability Testing Tool** for Google Cloud, and I’m at a point where I’d love some community feedback before I sink more time into it.\n\n**The Problem the tool aims to solve:** I am a Google Cloud trainer and I was writing course material for an advanced observability querying/alerting course. I needed to be able to easily generate great amounts of logs and metrics for the labs. I started writing this Python tool and then realised it could probably be useful more widely. I'm thinking when needing to validate complex LQL / Log Analytics SQL / PromQL queries or when testing PagerDuty/email alerting policies for systems where \"waiting for an error\" isn't a strategy, and manually inserting log entries via the Console is tedious.\n\nI looked at tools like `flog` (which is great), but I needed something that could natively talk to the Google Cloud API, handle authentication, and generate **metrics** (Time Series data) alongside logs.\n\n**What I built:** It's a CLI tool where you define \"Jobs\" in a YAML file. It has two main modes:\n\n1. **Historical Backfill:** \"Fill the last 24 hours with error logs.\" Great for testing dashboards and retrospective queries.\n2. **Live Mode:** \"Generate a Critical error every 10 seconds for the next 5 minutes.\" Great for testing live alert triggers.\n\nIt supports variables, so you can randomize IPs or fetch real GCE metadata (like instance IDs) to make the logs look realistic.\n\n**A simple config looks like this:**\n\n    loggingJobs:\n      - frequency: \"30s ~ 1m\"\n        startTime: \"2025-01-01T00:00:00\"\n        endOffset: \"5m\"\n        logName: \"application.log\"\n        level: \"ERROR\"\n        textPayload: \"An error has occurred\"\n\nBut things can get way more complex.\n\n**My questions for you:**\n\n1. **Does this already exist?** Is there a standard tool for \"observability seeding\" on GCP that I missed? If there’s an industry standard that does this better, I’d rather contribute to that than maintain a separate tool.\n2. **Is this a real pain point?** Do you find yourselves wishing you had a way to \"generate noise\" on demand? Or is the standard \"deploy and tune later\" approach usually good enough for your teams?\n3. **How would you actually use it?** Where would a tool like this fit in your workflow? Would you use it manually, or would you expect to put it in a CI pipeline to \"smoke test\" your monitoring stack before a rollout?\n\n**Repo is here:** [https://github.com/fmestrone/observability-testing-tool](https://github.com/fmestrone/observability-testing-tool)\n\n**Overview article on medium.com:** [https://blog.federicomestrone.com/dont-wait-for-an-outage-stress-test-your-google-cloud-observability-setup-today-a987166fcd68](https://blog.federicomestrone.com/dont-wait-for-an-outage-stress-test-your-google-cloud-observability-setup-today-a987166fcd68)\n\nThanks for roasting my code (or the idea)! 😀",

Frankly, the whole thing feels like something made to look slick and sell to execs.\n\nNow, as to my evidence as to why I think they are 90% swindle by volume:\n\n* They have no available documentation on their website. That's insane. Especially for an operations focused company. No honest tech product hides their docs. No honest engineer trusts a product that isn't documented.\n* Their \"get precise answers\" portion of their website is hot nonsense. They've leveraged the word \"graph\" and \"engine\" and a few company logos to imply that they're showing us how something works. They objectively don't understand how their own AI product works. This is just glitter to distract people from that fact.\n* Their blog (read: self-promoting sloppaganda) is the most robust part of their site. They have six blog posts across four categories. One category has nothing in it.\n\nWhat really gets me about this kind of bullshit company is that these goobers clearly have some talented people working for them. Or, enough that a decent idea creeps in every once in a while. In their [November 25th blog post](https://www.deductive.ai/blogs/introducing-deductive-the-ai-sre-for-fast-moving-teams), they mention that \"Reliability is a Reasoning Problem\". They're right! We need to understand our systems in order to make sure we know how they work. Then, we learn how they fail and make them better.\n\nInstead, they go on to talk about how we don't actually need to understand our systems. Because that's hard. Instead, we should give them a sack of money. Then they go on to glaze Sameer and Rakesh, the authors of said article. We get it. They think they're hot, cute, and funny. It's cuter to be humble, but go off kings?\n\nFurthermore, the [deductive.ai](http://deductive.ai) team isn't able to deliver key features on their basic-ass website. Stuff like docs and not having empty blog categories is the absolute basics. Why the fuck would I trust their opinion on Datadog or migrations? They can't get the basic details right.\n\nMore critically on the topic of their migration, they don't talk about setting up alerting, dashboards, or any other other useful human-readable tools. Nope, instead you should just use their AI nonsense.\n\nFrankly, if my company were looking at this \"solution\" i'd advice them in a professional capacity to stay the fuck away.\n\nMaybe their stuff kicks ass, and they wrote it in good faith. But I feel like this is more likely a cover up of getting caught red handed stealing from Datadog. I think we need to see a lot more from the company before we trust anything they have to say about observability or migrations.",
