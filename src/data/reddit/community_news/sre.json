          "text": "I saved the company a million dollars by fixing some load balancer retry timeout configs that were making things much much worse rather than better. There would be random situations where the service scaled up to max pods, and then magically recover a few minutes later. So instead of 3 of a thing with autoscaling up and down as customer demand rose and fell over a day we were running 50 minimum just to reduce the odds of sympathetic failures. With my fix in place the service stopped doing that and I was able to lower min back to a sane level.\n\nThese settings had been in place for years, after being repeatedly copypasta'd from a proof of concept; when I first asked our staff+ engineer about it he insisted the settings were mandatory to achieve a 100% latency SLO and closed the PR. I had to wait for him to quit to revisit this. Now the monthly operational review metrics look better, costs are down and paging events are down.\n\nOh, and also my manager got promoted and reassigned me to another team, who immediately put me on loan to a third team.

                  "text": "> Good job! If you don't mind, how did you find the root cause?\n\nI'd been looking at it for a long time, and then one of the core committers on our OSS load-balancer tech mentioned that retry config was really request hedging, and that had me looking at the settings:\n\n1. 4 simultaneous retries\n2. The smallest possible exponential backoff\n3. A request hedging deadline of like 10 percent more than average request time\n\nAll those seemed bad and wrong for the particular service in question. In particular exponential backoff with jitter is intended to cure the exact problem we encountered. I'd also been studying facebook engineering's metastable failure concepts and retry logic was one of the examples I'd seen in the literature, so it was on my radar to review.\n\nWhen I went looking for the PR & associated analysis for the settings was when I realized they hadn't changed since pure guesswork was used in demo / proof of concept. So with the most senior engineer leaving the company to start his own, and the second most out on paternity leave, I was able to push through the change as an experiment to prove it doesn't impact latency SLOs and in fact improves reliability outcomes. \"Science progresses one funeral at a time.\"\n\n> Regarding the team changes, does that occur a lot in FAANG? Is that much of a pain or are you happy working on different stuff with different people? \n\nIn my observations it happens every time a manager leaves or gets promoted. There is no succession planning, only succession emergency responses. I was actually pretty lucky to join the company right as a manager got promoted into his new job, so the time under one manager was longer than typical. My new team has had like 5 managers in 8 years.\n\nBut it's a huge pain, because of how promotions work. I've been asking for a promotion for years now, and knew getting reassigned was a death knell in the first year; getting me a promotion would come at the cost of his other staff he started the year with. But the real pain was the annual review: \"I agree you're already performing at the next level, but unfortunately the next level promotion requires upper management approval and a cross-functional project and I don't have any of those, so don't expect a promotion.\"\n\nWorse, my last cross functional project fell apart. The first month I joined, the SWE leading the project took a month off work. When she came back the ML engineer we needed announced his retirement in two months. The EPM technically assigned was a no-show (\"focused on other high priority projects\"), and the aforementioned SWE was clearly underwater from the number of new technologies the project was adopting. So I had basically no usable system to evaluate as an SRE. Even the junior engineer assigned to implement Prometheus metrics quit the company.\n\n> Also, are people mostly excellent, with good mindset, or is it like in any company with plenty of cruise-along folks?\n\nAbout half of my peers seem to be rest-and-vest. It's so bad in some places that some managers responded to the \"3 day return to office\" mandate by requiring monday and friday to be in office just to stop people from doing stealth 4 day weekends. But given that I appear to be permanently sidelined, I might join their cause. Or just retire on all the money I've already made, and catch up on my steam backlog.\n\nThere are plenty of good people doing good work. One or two of them might even be able to do good work and maintain work-life balance. And for key \"an executive will be fired if this doesn't ship\" initiatives, there's plenty of work being done.",

Trouble is there's like a zillion metrics being collected and you never know which ones are important until you solve the problem.\n\n> did people give you the appropriate amount of kudos for the money saved?\n\nNope! The person most directly responsible for budgeting and cost reporting appears to have been fired without a replacement, and upper leadership is more concerned about AI training costs and deliverables. My new manager was impressed but not too impressed since it's not his budget.\n\nThe new group I'm supporting is an internal tool, so it has an annual cloud spend so low that it would take a 100% cost reduction to match the result. So I've mostly been focused on improving their alerting, outage detection and CI situation. They are also rudderless when it comes to finops; but due to reorgs that happened last month at the highest level I'm not about to press the issue.",

      "text": "Looking for feedback from Meta Production Engineers, current or former.\n\nTo add context, I was an SRE-SWE at Google for a while, oncall for large-scale mission-critical services. SRE-SWE takes the same interviews as SWE do, and can transfer between SRE and SWE without technical interviews, something that SE-SRE, i.e. Systems Engineer SRE can't do.\n\nI've been invited to interview for a Meta PE role, but I'm not sure if it's a good fit: it looks like there's a lot of low-level Linux / kernel / networking questions asked, whereas I'm more of a software person. I'm interested in the low-level stuff too and I'm happy to learn it, it's just not where I excel at, and at Google, unless you're working on a team that's specifically dealing the network, disk servers, or low-level Borg teams, you're going to be doing things at the application layer. I can't remember a time when I SSH'ed into a production server once in my whole time there.\n\nAre there different kinds of Production Engineers at Meta? Do they all take the same kind of interview?\n\n  \nEDIT: Thanks everyone for the replies. Looks like I won't be applying to Meta :).",

The role has to fit into the culture and org to be effective. Facebook/Meta was more adhoc and flexible, Google has always been structured and organized (and mired in process).\n\nNeither is better than the other, it's ultimately about whether you're optimizing for rate of change and failing fast, or optimizing for slower, methodical, higher quality change (that may never actually ship).\n\nOn the systems and network interviews: this may be the gray beard talking, but IMO if you can't pass them, you probably shouldn't be an SRE at Google.

Personally, I spend a large percentage of my time writing design docs and code, and I don't think that is going to change anytime soon. I have been able to avoid teams that view PE as SRE because I want to work on big problems—not just reliability and scalability. This has allowed me to build new services, work on product features, and generally operate as a member of the SWE team.

In my personal opinion, the only things you can basically do is either reduce the number of hops or invest into preventative measures. Reducing the number of hops is often not necessarily something under your control or makes economical sense, so the thing that remains is preventative stuff, like:\n\n - Automatic canarying + rollback  \n - Client throttling + Load shedding  \n - Graceful degradation  \n - Autoscaling  \n - etc...\n\nAll this of course also carries a cost but I'd argue it's more future-proof and sustainable and investing time in reactive stuff.",

So you have to go figure those out and how to present them while still preserving a good signal to noise ratio (Like what's the point of showing deployments and config changes across everything, that's just going to lead to more confusion).\n\nSo instead of doing that work and getting a dashboard as a result, build the canary and auto rollback based on the metrics you would otherwise alert on into those rollouts and config update mechanisms you're investigating for this.\n\nWhat you built now is something that avoids getting paged in the first place and instead you have to deal with an autorollback where it tells you what metric went bad, and you can investigate in peace and quiet.",

Someone gets paged, they ack it, and then they're staring at an alert that says \"high error rate on checkout service\" with no idea if its a new deploy, a dependency issue, or just Black Friday traffic patterns doing something weird. We'd lose 10-15 minutes just getting oriented.\n\nWhat actually moved the needle for us was investing heavily in runbooks that are linked directly from alerts, not living in some separate wiki nobody remembers to check at 3am. The key was making them specific enough to be useful but not so detailed they become outdated instantly. Like instead of \"investigate checkout errors\" we'd have \"checkout error rate > 2% - first check payment gateway status page, then recent deploys in last 2hrs, then db connection pool metrics.\" Giving the on-call person a clear first three places to look saved so much fumbling around.\n\nThe other thing that helped way more than I expected was having strong service ownership. When everyone knows exactly who owns what, you're not wasting time in Slack asking \"hey does anyone know about the inventory sync service\" while customers are getting errors. Its like mise en place in cooking honestly, all that boring prep work of documenting ownership and keeping it current pays off massively when things go sideways.",

The first 3 were at a startup where I had to do a little bit of everything: data, fullstack, infra, product, etc etc.\n\nI found infra interesting, so I took an SRE position at a more mature startup where the infra team was also doing production code for both internal and external capabilities. However, earlier last year there was some restructuring at the VP/lead level, and shortly thereafter our team basically stopped doing any software engineering or coding. The services and tools we maintained were transferred to other teams or changed to third party vendors.\n\nNowadays we mostly just do ClickOps, write YAML files, and bash scripts for GHA, and I’ve recently realized I’m bored out of my mind and have no interest in any of the upcoming projects for our team's roadmap.\n\nSo what I wanted to ask y'all was: is coding common in SRE roles and I just had bad luck, or is this the current state of SRE?  Should I just go back to backend/fullstack roles if i want to keep on coding?",

So if you have some of those niggly repeat action workarounds like \"we know the server runs out of space every so often and most of the time we fix it by deleting old logs\", you can have rundeck do that automatically when a space incident is created, fixing the issue without raising an incident. \nIts a bad example in that we can probably agree that it should be fixed permanently but most places have a bunch of these things on the todo list. It also allows fixed script execution for the responders, so they can run the Automation from within PagerDuty or sometimes your ITSM tooling i think. \nYou can do most of it by doing what you suggest but it would require logins to rundeck as well and relying on manual intervention",

I’m genuinely trying to understand whether this pain exists outside my bubble.\n\nCheers!",

These become top priority since whatever upper-management wants done is always top priority.\n* There's also usually some triage done to determine what's actually an \"action item\" and what's a \"project\"\n   * It's really easy for someone to say \"we need to do/fix X\" during a post-mortem. But doing/fixing X might be months of work for one or more teams\n   * In those cases they stop being action items and become projects put on a roadmap and prioritized like anything else\n\nThe reality of course is that smaller action items tend to slip into the backlog until/unless they cause another incident. Most teams are under-staffed and over-burdened so it's generally expected that most things that hit a team's backlog will probably never get done until there's some forcing function to do them.",
