          "text": "In my experience- Datadog has been an amazing observability tool. \n\nThe event correlation was a big deal and difference maker when reviewing their stack against others like new relic, app lnsights, signalfx and even dynatrace.  Dynatrace was actually a pretty close second imo but where they lost me is they failed to remove unused or empty data selectors from selection scope. For example - if im an Azure shop - i dont want to have to scroll past empty non-used AWS metrics and features just to find data I am ingesting and needing to filter down to. (Atleast 3ish years ago it was this way, not sure about now) + a few other small things. \nAnyway - back to the question: that quick data isolation moment in time saves time when needing to jump in quick if you didnt do the firedrill work to make those correlations or build the visibility before hand\n\nOne other piece that im quite impressed with Datadog tooling before and during an issue is how light their continuous profiler is.  Super cheap on resources and just seems to work in most cases - making it more comfortable to turn it on, let it ride in a close lower and curve some of that production inefficiency or spotting edge case bugs in production based on conditions that may not have been possible to reproduce in a lower (vendors didnt offer sandbox or test envs so production is your testing bed for feature with live traffic, not just mock data)\n\nI'm not a super huge fan of their RUM though and their syntetics could be a little more flexible. - that product suite just feels a bit clunky imo.\n\nLastly - npm has been a life saver in a k8s environment- it builds huge context into what's talking to what and can filter down pretty nicely to isolate traffic patterns so let's say \"podx is in imagepullbackoff\" - why? Well typically first thing you think is it not being able to pull its image from whatever container registry. Well I've actually caught an issue in scenarios like this where the pod was trying to hit the ACR at its public endpoint and not its private connection endpoint configure - forcing us to open up to public with restrictions to satisfy the incident, open ticket with msft and better understand the conditions which turned out to be msft side issue. - without npm in our pocket, looking at DNS queries and outbound connection attempts would have been a lot tough/slower.\n\nOthers may disagree with a few points here but they have all helped myself and my teams in their journey for reliability and they seem to win the race mostly every time. \nThey are pricey a f though nonetheless lol",

I can't commit to picking up the kid from school or activities because I can't be sure I won't be in the middle of an incident.\n\n\nWeirdly I enjoy actually handling pages. I don't dread finding out what has paged me, I get excited to go figure it out.  I'm very strongly problem motivated, if you throw a set of problems at me that I've got the skills to start tackling, I'm happy as can be. Doubly so if it means I get a chance to learn something.  A page is just a fresh challenge.  The flip side of that is I get extremely pissed off by false positive alarms, because I go in to the situation expecting a problem only to find nothing!\n\n\nI've been on-call in one form or another for approaching 20 years now, so it's not like the experience is new or novel either. ",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on an open-source Python tool I decided to call the **Observability Testing Tool** for Google Cloud, and I’m at a point where I’d love some community feedback before I sink more time into it.\n\n**The Problem the tool aims to solve:** I am a Google Cloud trainer and I was writing course material for an advanced observability querying/alerting course. I needed to be able to easily generate great amounts of logs and metrics for the labs. I started writing this Python tool and then realised it could probably be useful more widely. I'm thinking when needing to validate complex LQL / Log Analytics SQL / PromQL queries or when testing PagerDuty/email alerting policies for systems where \"waiting for an error\" isn't a strategy, and manually inserting log entries via the Console is tedious.\n\nI looked at tools like `flog` (which is great), but I needed something that could natively talk to the Google Cloud API, handle authentication, and generate **metrics** (Time Series data) alongside logs.\n\n**What I built:** It's a CLI tool where you define \"Jobs\" in a YAML file. It has two main modes:\n\n1. **Historical Backfill:** \"Fill the last 24 hours with error logs.\" Great for testing dashboards and retrospective queries.\n2. **Live Mode:** \"Generate a Critical error every 10 seconds for the next 5 minutes.\" Great for testing live alert triggers.\n\nIt supports variables, so you can randomize IPs or fetch real GCE metadata (like instance IDs) to make the logs look realistic.\n\n**A simple config looks like this:**\n\n    loggingJobs:\n      - frequency: \"30s ~ 1m\"\n        startTime: \"2025-01-01T00:00:00\"\n        endOffset: \"5m\"\n        logName: \"application.log\"\n        level: \"ERROR\"\n        textPayload: \"An error has occurred\"\n\nBut things can get way more complex.\n\n**My questions for you:**\n\n1. **Does this already exist?** Is there a standard tool for \"observability seeding\" on GCP that I missed? If there’s an industry standard that does this better, I’d rather contribute to that than maintain a separate tool.\n2. **Is this a real pain point?** Do you find yourselves wishing you had a way to \"generate noise\" on demand? Or is the standard \"deploy and tune later\" approach usually good enough for your teams?\n3. **How would you actually use it?** Where would a tool like this fit in your workflow? Would you use it manually, or would you expect to put it in a CI pipeline to \"smoke test\" your monitoring stack before a rollout?\n\n**Repo is here:** [https://github.com/fmestrone/observability-testing-tool](https://github.com/fmestrone/observability-testing-tool)\n\n**Overview article on medium.com:** [https://blog.federicomestrone.com/dont-wait-for-an-outage-stress-test-your-google-cloud-observability-setup-today-a987166fcd68](https://blog.federicomestrone.com/dont-wait-for-an-outage-stress-test-your-google-cloud-observability-setup-today-a987166fcd68)\n\nThanks for roasting my code (or the idea)! 😀",

But ultimately participate in enabling good process design, be the change.",

Where folks are adding process, it's usually because really improving things can't be conceived of by non-technical people, or because it's not considered worth the cost, so process is the plan B.\n\nIt has all the costs you mention, but typically is either neutral or more commonly actually makes things worse.",

      "text": "Hi,\n\nWeird question I know, but the reason is I was laid off end of last month after 27yrs as an Architect/Platform Engineer.   I was basically an SRE but didn't have the title.  \n\nBefore I separated from the company I was working on implementing istio/opentelemetry/prometheus/graphana/tempo and integrating with JIRA and Gitlab \n\nIt was just in the design phase but the systems where there GKE/AWS test clusters running our platform so I had plenty of data to build this out.\n\nSo now all I have is my home lab and I want to build it out so I can test and improve my design.  Also buff up on my Python as we didn't really use it.  \n\nIs there such a thing that just runs in the cluster and produces logs, simulates issues including OOMs/pod restarts/etc so you can test/rate your design?\n\nThanks for any info.",

I started to collect those [in this repository](https://github.com/causely-oss/awesome-synthetic-apps), here are a few you might be the most interested in:\n\n* [https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo), official OpenTelemetry demo, has some feature flags to simulate issues (most of them are application related, not infra)\n* [https://github.com/causely-oss/chaosmania](https://github.com/causely-oss/chaosmania), has some mocks for CPU and Memory issues, which you can use to create OOms etc.\n\nThere are a lot more, and the list on that repo is most likely incomplete, so if you find more or anyone knows more, I am happy to build it out.\n\nAdditionally, what you can do is run any of those demo apps and combine it with some chaos testing solutions, I used pumba (https://github.com/alexei-led/pumba/) in the past, since it fit my needs and was easy to get started, but there are also solutions like Litmus or ChaosMesh, but I have not a lot of experience with them.",
