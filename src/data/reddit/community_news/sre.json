      "text": "I've held the title of an \"SRE\" for around 5 years yet have never felt like one. Orgs I worked for did not have any SLO defined and the idea around monitoring a service was that it \"should be up as much as possible\". Things usually were driven by dev and what they wanted to do and SRE was more of the Ops team of old days with fancy tooling and new designations. For the most part I have seen titles like \"devops engineer\" and \"SRE\" used interchangeably for the person who does everything, you are the guy who gets the pager, you are the guy who has to deal with whims and fancies of devs, you are the guy with too much responsibility and almost always low autonomy. \n\nI have been applying for jobs lately and every company I have interviewed with do not have a dedicated release team, SREs are supposed to be doing everything, I don't see the practice of error budgets being applied for release. Most of these \"SRE\" roles do not do any value add but simply do reactive response work and firefighting, babysitting systems instead of changing things, needless to say such places get political in no time.\n\nI'd like to hear from others in the industry, do you have release work and reliability work divided in your org? How much autonomy does your org provide? Does SRE have technical say? Do devs listen? Can SRE negotiate?\n\nIs this the \"industry norm\" or I'm just unlucky?",

      "text": "I built a small interactive simulation to explore routing decisions based on continuous signals instead of binary thresholds.\n\nThe simulation biases traffic continuously using health, load, and capacity signals.\n\nThe goal was to see how routing behaves during:\n\n\\- gradual performance degradation\n\n\\- latency brownouts with low error rates\n\n\\- recovery after stress\n\nThis is not production software. It’s a simulated system meant to make the dynamics visible.\n\nLive demo (simulated): [https://gradiente-mocha.vercel.app/](https://gradiente-mocha.vercel.app/)\n\nI’m mainly looking for feedback on whether this matches real-world failure patterns or feels misleading in any way.",
