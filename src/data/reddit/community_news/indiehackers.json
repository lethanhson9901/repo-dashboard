More money = more validation. If no one's buying it, refine it.

Almost every mistake founders make is doing the right thing at the wrong time: ads before pull, investors before users, polish before proof, scale before fit.\n\nThe “do things that don’t scale” + staying employed while bootstrapping combo is especially underrated. It buys you patience, and patience is basically a superpower in the early stage. Most people don’t fail because the idea is bad, they fail because they run out of emotional or financial runway.\n\nAlso +1 on refunds and free early access. Trust compounds faster than revenue at the beginning, and people who feel treated fairly come back later. Congrats on $12k/mo, and thanks for sharing the unglamorous parts instead of a victory lap.",

But if I made it fully free, would they even value it enough to give real feedback? Classic chicken-and-egg.\n\n\\#5 and #8 also feel spot-on. I'm posting daily across TikTok, Reddit, LinkedIn, X - testing what actually converts. Zero paid ads yet because I haven't cracked organic. Feels like I'm throwing spaghetti at the wall but at least I'm learning what sticks haha.\n\nQuestion: when you kept it free at the start, how long until you switched to paid? And did you grandfather the free users or convert them?\n\nAlso curious - did you build aicofounder solo or with a co-founder (given #14)? 😄",

After getting feedback, I focused on simplifying the navigation and adding clear calls-to-action.\n\nThe outcome? User engagement shot up by 40% and conversion rates doubled! Key takeaway:\n\n**always prioritize user experience , it really pays off**. Now I'm applying these lessons to my new project, FakeSniff [https://fakesniff.vercel.app](https://fakesniff.vercel.app), and can’t wait to see how it turns out!\n\nPlease give a feedback",

I’ve had the privilege of helping him shape it using my psychology expertise, testing it firsthand, and helping ensure it’s safe, user-led, and trauma-informed.\n\n\nPrivacy is built-in: nothing you share is sold or exposed, and even Adonis does not see your data.\n\n\nHe is adding a gentle, optional user assessment. It’s not a test, it’s not diagnostic, it simply helps Haven adapt to the user’s needs while fully respecting boundaries.\n\n\nYou can find Haven by searching for “Haven by Prometheus Systems” in your browser. For now, it works best on a Windows laptop or desktop, but an app is coming soon!\n\n\nHaven is always evolving. Any feedback you share would mean the world to Adonis, and me. Thank you for helping us make Haven even better.\n\n\n— Logan",

      "text": "I've been building software for over 15 years. Worked at Bloomberg and Shopify as an engineer, started a few companies. So when I started vibe coding with Lovable, I figured I'd skip most of the beginner mistakes. I was wrong about that.\n\nHere's what actually caught me off guard across 8 builds (affirmations app, pomodoro timer, cat of the day, dating bio rewriter, cancel plans generator, recipe app, workout timer, astrology app):\n\n**Auth is where most vibe-coded apps silently break.** Every AI tool will give you a login screen that works when you type in the right email and password. That's the happy path. But try entering wrong credentials, or sign up with a password that doesn't meet requirements, or test the Google OAuth flow when consent gets denied. Most of the time the error handling is either missing or the messages are gibberish. I spent more time fixing auth edge cases than building actual features on several of these apps. And here's the real kicker: I added a major feature to one of my apps and Lovable's model went and rewrote parts of my auth flow in the process. Suddenly nobody could log in. That regression cost me more time than the feature itself.\n\n**Meta-prompting changed my output quality overnight.** Instead of going straight to Lovable with \"build me an affirmations app,\" I started describing my product vision to Claude first and asking it to generate the Lovable prompt for me. Claude adds structure, specificity, visual design direction, page-by-page breakdowns. The difference in what Lovable produces from a meta-prompt vs. a cold prompt is dramatic. I do this for every build now.\n\n**The 90/90 problem is real.** AI gets you 90% of the way in about 90 seconds. The last 10%, error states, edge cases, polish, that's where 90% of your actual time goes. Most tutorials skip this part entirely, which is why so many people hit a wall after their first build looks great but doesn't actually hold up.\n\n**Niche apps outperform \"big idea\" apps every time.** I built a generic pomodoro timer and a pomodoro timer specifically for writers. The writer-specific one got more interest by a wide margin. Same with the workout timer. I didn't build it for gym people. I built it for people who hate the gym. The more specific your audience, the less competition you have and the more your users feel like you built it for them. Because you did.\n\n**Meme apps get traction that serious apps don't.** The cancel plans excuse generator got more attention than apps I spent significantly longer on. My take: we're in a moment where anyone can build an app in 20 minutes, so the ones that break through are the ones that make people laugh and hit share. Big companies can't afford to look ridiculous. Their brand won't let them. That makes silly apps surprisingly safe territory.\n\nThose were the big ones. Happy to get into specifics on any of these if people have questions. I've been documenting my builds so I have a lot of the details fresh.",

I spend a lot of time going through periodic code reviews and then focus sessions on removing technical debt, ensuring patters are followed etc. This is particularly important as when you go back to feature development - consistent code patterns helps the AI understand the and interact with the code structure in a predictable way. Everything has units tests that get run all the time. However now that I am well past MVP (and it's the building side I enjoy the most) - more and more time is spent on generating interest, running betas, social media, etc. I suspect this will become more and more the case as it becomes easier to build very application software.

For example, I’m teaching a workshop on agentic AI today and instead of preparing a google doc with notes, i threw it together on lovable: \n\nhttps://sunny.expert/2026-02-cbs-ai-club-workshop",

Not an impressive number by startup-Twitter standards, but it covers my devops costs, AI tools, and about half of my car payment. More importantly, it’s stable and still growing month over month.\n\nWhat surprised me most is that none of this came from TikTok hype, Instagram reels, or viral launches. No big audience. No “growth hacks.” Just a boring combination of shipping consistently, fixing UX friction, listening to user complaints, and iterating for months.\n\nPeople keep saying the app market is dead, SaaS is saturated, hardware is impossible, etc. From what I’m seeing, that’s mostly noise. Revenue still compounds if you keep improving something real. Whether you’re building a mobile app, a SaaS, or even a physical product: if users are getting value and you keep showing up, the curve eventually bends upward. It’s not glamorous, but it works.\n\nI’m still iterating on my app daily, and I expect it to keep growing and not because of hype, but because people actually use it.\n\n**If you’re in a slump right now: don’t stop. This is probably the best time in history to keep building.**",

The barrier to entry has never been lower, which means more problems are getting solved by people who actually understand them firsthand.

No viral moment, no big audience. What's working: posting in Facebook groups with a genuine \"here's a problem I solved\" angle. Got 44 downloads in one day from that. Total around 85 now. No paying customers yet, but people are trying it.\n\nThe hardest part isn't building - it's the gap between \"people download it\" and \"people actually use it and pay.\" Right now I'm trying to figure out where users drop off in the setup process. Classic activation problem.\n\nYour point about \"fixing UX friction and listening to user complaints\" hits hard. That's exactly where I am - the product works, now I need to make onboarding so smooth that non-technical store owners can set it up without thinking.\n\nWhat was the turning point for you between \"people download it\" and \"people actually pay\"?",

Got 2 paying customers, even had meetings with directors of global companies, but ultimately it is too much work to try to get customers and big companies are turned off from working with a solo founder.\n\n  \n2nd product: \"Strava for everything\". It was a social network where you can link all your APIs, e.g. Stripe, Steam, GitHub, YouTube, Chess etc and share your updates with friends. Still running, but I've stopped working on it, got about 50 signups.\n\n  \n3rd product: Helps people reduce their carbon emissions and save money. You can scan a product and it tells you lower carbon alternatives and the price difference. I did a startup programme for this at a university, got about 200 signups, some daily active users, but hard to increase retention and haven't implemented monetisation.\n\n  \n4th product: Filters your raw notification feed from X to only tell you replies that are relevant, based on your instructions. E.g. \"Only send me replies where people are asking about my product\". Saves time and prevents doomscrolling after you only went on X because someone liked your post. Started building it on Saturday, launched it on Sunday (last night). Link: [https://www.raw-bot.com/](https://www.raw-bot.com/)\n\nAfter the 3rd product, I decided that if I make another app it will have monetisation as the core feature and have it built in right away. Not \"build an app, get users and then hope you can monetise them later.\" I'd rather have 5 paying users than 200 free ones. So, that's what I've built, it's super basic but it provides value with the core feature. Let's see how it goes!  \n",

That's a pretty big shift from your first 3 which all came from personal pain points. I wonder if the monetization-first mindset accidentally pushed you away from the \"build for yourself\" instinct that generated your best ideas.\n\n\n\nNot saying it's wrong — plenty of successful products were built for other people's problems. But there's a weird middle ground where you end up optimizing for \"what could someone pay for\" instead of \"what do I desperately need\" and the product ends up kinda lukewarm. You know the problem intellectually but you don't feel it in your gut, so you make slightly off decisions about what matters.\n\n\n\nYour B2B review tool had paying customers and you walked away from it because distribution was painful. That's the one I'd go back to honestly. The product-market fit was there, you just hated the sales process. Finding a cofounder who loves cold outreach might be easier than finding product-market fit from scratch again.",

(I took as invisible launches <10 upvotes)\n\nThe main reason I found was because of the tagline/headline/short description call it whatever. Let’s break down what winners do, because yes, there is a pattern identified not just ‘sounds cool’.\n\n1. What never worked in my sample:\n\n* “The #1 platform for modern teams.”\n* “Reinventing how you work.”\n* “Supercharge your business with AI.”\n\n1. Cut the crap\n\nYou maybe get half a second to get that attention so let’s remove the crap :\n\n* The sweet spot is 7–9 words & around 40–55 characters.\n* One clear sentence, no buzzwords, no “revolutionizing X with AI”.\n* No random emojis, no ALL CAPS, no “best-in-class” type claims.\n\n1. Be clear\n\nIf your tagline doesn’t answer “what does this do, and for who?” in that half second, they scroll past.\n\nThe best-performing taglines all did one of these two things:\n\n* Outcome-first: “Turn abandoned carts into revenue for Shopify stores.” (more demos booked, fewer bugs, faster support.)\n* Audience-first: “Analytics that non-technical founders actually understand.” (SaaS founders, agencies, solopreneurs, Shopify stores, recruiters.)\n\n1. Link with an action verb\n\nTo make a proper tagline, you need a clear verb: turn, track, collect, launch, ship.\n\nIt will connect the feature to the audience, or to the outcome or the audience to the outcome, your choice.\n\nI reverse‑engineered patterns from standout vs invisible launches and [turned it into a small playbook.](https://startuphunt.io/before-you-launch)\n\nIt breaks down:\n\n* How they picked categories that actually sent traffic\n* How they timed launches across directories\n* How they wrote one‑line pitches people clicked\n* What failed launches looked like on the same sites\n\nA fun exercise to prove how good it is : Give me your current tagline (and website) and I’ll recraft your tagline",

Especially when you're just trying to get a quick webhook → Slack flow or AI agent that summarizes emails running locally or on a VPS.\n\nI got fed up with it, so I open-sourced the full backend that powers **a2n.io** and made it ridiculously easy to self-host. Repo: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nTry this one-liner right now:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nOpen http://localhost:8080, create your admin account, and you're building flows. Embedded DB + Redis mean **zero** external dependencies for dev, testing, or small personal use. (For production, swap in your own DATABASE\\_URL and REDIS\\_URL – still simple.)\n\nWhat you actually get in that container:\n\n\\- Drag-and-drop canvas (React Flow style – feels familiar if you've used n8n)\n\n\\- 30+ built-in nodes: Webhook/Schedule triggers, Google Sheets/Slack/Notion/Telegram/Gmail/Discord/GitHub/Twilio/OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok, HTTP/GraphQL/SQL, JS/Python code, filters/loops/if-else, file handling, and more\n\n\\- Real AI agent nodes that reason, call tools, and chain LLMs – no extra setup\n\n\\- Live execution monitoring + logs so you see runs happen in real time\n\n\\- MIT license – completely yours, **no white-label forced branding**, no phoning home, unlimited workflows/executions\n\nIt's MIT, so fork it, strip it, brand it, whatever. Your data never leaves your server.\n\nTrade-offs (being straight up):\n\n\\- Node library is smaller than n8n's massive ecosystem (growing, but focused on practical 80/20 stuff)\n\n\\- No ultra-advanced custom scripting depth yet (though JS/Python nodes exist)\n\n\\- Embedded mode is great for quick spins but use external DB/Redis + reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy/Traefik) for anything exposed or high-traffic\n\n\\- Project is new – repo just went public, so community is tiny and battle-testing is early\n\nI've got mine humming on a cheap VPS for daily drivers (Sheet syncs, notification bots, AI summaries) – deploys fast, runs stable, feels light compared to heavier stacks.\n\nIf the usual self-host setup tax has kept you from running more automations privately, pull the image and mess around for 5 minutes. Worst case, you delete the container.\n\nWhat usually stops you from self-hosting workflow tools like this? The multi-service compose files, worrying about updates breaking things, missing niche nodes, or just \"hosted is easier for now\"? Real talk appreciated – this is meant to scratch that exact itch.",

How many are paying? Is this thing growing?\n\nIndie Panel fixes that. You connect your PostgreSQL databases (works with Neon, Supabase, or any standard Postgres) and immediately get a clean dashboard with:\n\n\\- Total users and paid user counts\n\n\\- Growth trends and daily snapshots\n\n\\- Charts that track your metrics over time\n\n\\- AES-256 encrypted database connections\n\nIt's one dashboard for all your projects, so you can stop context-switching between databases and focus on building.\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback! What metrics do you wish you had better visibility into across your projects? \n\n  \nP.S. I'm launching on ProductHunt, where you'll find a 30% off coupon!\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/indie-panel?launch=indie-panel](https://www.producthunt.com/products/indie-panel?launch=indie-panel)",

Repo here: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nOne-liner to spin it up:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nHit http://localhost:8080 and you're in. Built-in embedded DB + Redis so no external services needed for quick tests. For real use, just pass your own Postgres/Redis URLs and secrets.\n\nWhat you get out of the box:\n\n\\- Same visual builder: nodes, connections, real-time execution/logs\n\n\\- 30+ integrations: Google Sheets/Slack/Notion/Telegram/Gmail/GitHub/Discord/OpenAI/Twilio/etc.\n\n\\- Built-in AI agent nodes (supports OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Grok – tool use and all)\n\n\\- No white-label restrictions or forced branding – it's MIT licensed, your instance, your rules\n\n\\- Unlimited executions/workflows when self-hosted (no artificial caps)\n\nIt's not a 1:1 n8n clone—node library is smaller (growing), no ultra-deep custom code nodes yet, but for the 80% of practical flows that actually ship? This cuts the deployment pain to almost zero.\n\nI've been running it locally and on a cheap VPS—feels snappy, data stays private, and no more \"update broke my instance\" surprises.\n\nIf you're tired of heavy orchestration for simple things, give the Docker image a spin and tell me what breaks first (or what you'd want added). What's stopping you from self-hosting more automations right now—setup complexity, missing nodes, or just not worth the hassle? Genuinely want to hear.",

Build something useful, get users, make money. Turns out the internet being \"huge\" doesn't mean people automatically find you.\n\nBut I'm still using KironX every day.\n\nNot on LinkedIn's Jobs section. On my actual feed.\n\nI filter posts from my network:\n\n* founders mentioning problems\n* recruiters posting roles before they go public\n* CTOs talking about their roadmap\n* companies I'm connected to announcing growth\n\nI'm looking for off-market opportunities, the kind you can't find scrolling job boards.\n\nYesterday someone asked if I'd tried raising funds or reaching out to VCs. Honestly, that feels like a longer, more uncertain road right now and my anxiety is already high enough.\n\nSo I'm at a crossroads:\n\n1. Stop everything. Close the experiment, focus on getting hired.\n2. Keep going. Use my own product to find opportunities and see what happens even if it's risky.\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nI'll post Day 28 tomorrow and share whether this actually led anywhere.",

Before that, I had been doing some indie hacking on and off, but I never planned to quit my job for it.\n\nGetting laid off changed things. Even if I found a new job, the anxiety of “I could be let go again anytime” really stuck with me. That’s when I started taking indie hacking more seriously, while still consistently applying for jobs in parallel.\n\nTo be honest about the results so far: there haven’t been many. I haven’t been able to land a job for months (and the developer job market is extremely tough globally right now). On top of that, I’m in a situation where I don’t have enough savings to cover living expenses much longer, so if I don’t get a job soon, things get very difficult.\n\nBecause of that, I’ve decided to pause indie hacking for now and focus fully on job hunting. It’s been about two weeks already.\n\nI’ve completely stopped building, although I’m still doing some promotion and sharing what I’ve built. but there’s no clear signal of when (or if) that will lead anywhere. There’s also no guarantee that users would actually pay for the product I made.\n\nPersonally, unless I’m in a stable financial situation, I wouldn’t walk away from a job.",

Didn’t market it, didn’t monetize it, didn’t even tweet about it.\n\nNow it’s just sitting there.\n\nRather than half-assing it, I’d rather pass it to someone who actually wants to grow it.\n\n**Current state:**\n\n* Pre-revenue\n* Zero promotion\n* Lots of room to experiment\n\nFeels like a perfect playground for ads, affiliates, or viral short-form content. Happy to share more info if this sounds like your kind of project.\n\n\n\n***Update: It's the keyword \"Spanglish Translator\" that has 700k search volume according to a keyword research tool called Ubersuggest, not my site that's getting 700k search traffic!***",

          "text": "This is actually a fascinating starting point. 700k monthly searches is substantial traffic just waiting to be captured.\n\nA few thoughts on potential paths forward:\n\n1. Affiliate model with translation services - there is huge intent behind Spanglish searches, people actually want to communicate across languages\n\n2. Ad revenue on the translation queries - this is high-volume, low-intent traffic which works well for display ads\n\n3. Language learning angle - Spanglish users are often people trying to improve their English or Spanish, could upsell courses\n\nThe smart move might be validating one monetization angle quickly before handing it off. Set up Google AdSense for a week, see what CPM you get. Run one affiliate link test. That data makes the asset way more valuable to a buyer.\n\nWhat kind of traffic are you seeing right now even without any SEO work?\n\n",

One Adsense placement. One affiliate link. One 'best Spanglish books' Amazon link. Literally anything that proves the traffic can convert.\n\nA site with 700k searches and $0 revenue looks like a hobby. A site with 700k searches and $50/month looks like a business.

One time the backups didn't even exist. Recently tested a Postgres backup from Supabase — it was there but incomplete. Missing tables, truncated data.\n\nLooked for solutions: Veeam and Commvault do backup validation, but only inside their own ecosystem at enterprise pricing. Nothing vendor-agnostic for SMBs.\n\nSo I'm building it. The concept:\n→ Deploy a runner on your infra\n→ It restores your backup in an isolated container\n→ Runs verification (SQL queries, file checks, archive integrity)\n→ Signs the report cryptographically\n→ Destroys everything — zero data leaves your network\n\nDashboard for CTOs and auditors (ISO 27001 / SOC 2).\n\nSolo founder, Go + Vue.js, MVP nearly done. Landing page is live to gauge interest.\n\nhttps://restoreproof.io \n\nAnyone dealt with this problem? Would love to hear your take.",

      "text": "Alright, here is a quick tutorial on how to be better with AI as I see some comments made here and people take all this effort to set up the bot and then just f off into the distance.\n\nWe run a social media API. No account limits. Which means I see an absurd amount of content go through our system.\n\nSome of it is bad. Like objectively bad. I’ll chalk some of that up to cultural differences and move on. Some of it is actually decent. Sometimes even looks human.\n\nI talk to our clients a lot because thats how you build partnerships and just asked around what they are doing and how. They understand that If I were to steal their busisnes I woudl did that already.\n\nRoughly:\n\n* \\~25% of the good stuff is written by actual humans\n* the rest is AI, but conditioned on the user\n* about half uses custom-trained models\n* the other half is just GPT behind a decent wrapper\n\nThe common thing for the GPT wrappers is that they all pass a brand voice file  at the start of each session.\n\nNot a “tone: friendly” prompt.  \nAn actual config that tells the model how the brand talks, what it avoids, how it structures things, what words are banned, etc.\n\nI asked a few clients how they do it, merged a couple of their setups, and cleaned it up so it’s reusable. You can pick what you want and delete the rest.\n\nHow to use it?  \nI’m not your mom. Play with it.\n\nIf you’re an agency, the obvious move is:  \ntalk to the client, steal their stories, weird phrases, strong opinions, dump that into the XML. Output improves immediately.\n\nThere’s a smaller version below.  \nFull version is on the blog. No signup, no paywall, just copy-paste.\n\nLink:  \n[https://info.bundle.social/blog/how-to-create-ai-brand-voice-xml](https://info.bundle.social/blog/how-to-create-ai-brand-voice-xml)\n\nIf you want to give something back, click around the blog and read something.

The fix that actually works is validation at generation time... run each output through a lightweight check against your banned list and structure rules before it hits the user, then re-generate on failure.

You can write 50 rules and the model will still drift, but give it 3-4 real samples of how you actually write and it picks up on rhythm and word choice way better than any rule can describe.\n\n  \nOne thing I'd add to this template though — negative examples specific to YOUR brand, not just generic AI slop. Like \"here's a draft I rejected and why\" next to the good ones. That contrast teaches the model more than banned words alone. Banned words catch the obvious tells but they won't fix the deeper problem of everything sounding like it came from the same slightly-too-polished voice.\n\n  \nAlso +1 to what pbalIII said about drift. Even with a perfect config, by message 4 or 5 the model starts echoing itself. We ended up just re-injecting the voice file every few messages instead of trusting the context window to hold it.",

When you write out explicit rules about what your brand sounds like, it becomes clear where your actual content drifts from your ideal voice.\n\n  \nA practical approach I've used - take your best performing posts or emails, paste them into Claude with a prompt like 'extract the patterns that make this sound like our brand' and let it identify the common threads. Then formalize those into the config.\n\n  \nThe banned words list is underrated. Removing 'delve' and 'tapestry' alone makes such a difference. Have you experimented with industry-specific banned words? For developer tools, banning phrases like 'revolutionary' or 'disrupt' has been more impactful than I expected.\n\n",

Takes seconds to test.\n\nWhat usually stops you from self-hosting workflow tools? The dependency pile-up, security worries, missing nodes, or just the time sink? Real answers appreciated – this is built to cut exactly those barriers. 🚀",

Influencer marketing hit $24B in 2025, but it's getting saturated. Meanwhile, 86% of consumers say brands are most trustworthy when they co-create with customers.\n\n(I’m not saying these ‘4’ types are dead, no, just the MOAT is evolving)\n\nAnd companies that personalize through co-creation see 40% more revenue growth than competitors.\n\nLEGO proved this at scale. They let fans submit and vote on product ideas. Result: 2.8 million community members, 135,000+ ideas submitted, and a $90M business line with 40% profit margins. It incentive:\n\n* cross-selling among satisfied users\n* free user acquisition\n* constant feedback\n\nNow here's what's changed: with AI, anyone can build anything. Products are a commodity. The only real moat is your audience. And the strongest audiences aren't followers. They're these active users.\n\n**So how do you actually do this?**\n\nStep 1: Own your audience through email. Not social. Not algorithms (example : a newsletter you control or just gathering email with your project)\n\nStep 2: Feature the people who engage. Interview them. Showcase them. Make them the content. Any original idea is welcomed.\n\nStep 3: Build the product that matches the value you're already giving.\n\nI'm running this with two projects right now:\n\n[StartupHunt.io](http://StartupHunt.io) that started as a newsletter. I feature founders who reply to my emails. I interview them, spotlight their projects. Now I'm building a product on top that matches the value I already bring them (not live but the principle is here)\n\n[TrustViews.io](http://TrustViews.io)**, a** directory ranking people by views. I'm launching a newsletter where I break down the strategies behind each person's traffic curve from listed people. The directory feeds the newsletter. The newsletter feeds the directory.\n\nThe framework in 3 words: **feature your users.**\n\nHave reviews? Showcase them in the newsletter.\n\nHave top performers? Interview them.\n\nHave case studies? Tell their stories.\n\nWhen your users ARE the content, you don't have a distribution problem. They share because they're in it. That’s today’s MOAT.",

      "text": "Hey Indie Hackers,\n\nI wanted to share a real experiment I didn’t fully expect to work this well.\n\nI built a macOS AI app called **Asogenie**. Instead of marketing it, I used it internally to generate **all App Store screenshots and metadata** for another app of mine, **VideAI**.\n\nHere’s the important part:  \nAsogenie doesn’t just “generate text or images.”\n\nIt takes:\n\n* **Raw App Store screenshots**\n* **Country-specific keywords I select**\n\nAnd then generates:\n\n* **ASO-optimized metadata per country**\n* **Localized screenshots adapted to each country’s language**\n* Copy and visuals aligned with local App Store behavior\n\nNo ads.  \nNo social posts.  \nNo influencer marketing.\n\nJust country-based ASO assets generated with Asogenie.\n\nAfter 30 days, VideAI made **$1,100+**.\n\nA lot of people say *“ASO is dead”*.\n\nI’m not claiming this is massive revenue — but this felt like solid proof that **ASO still works**, especially when it’s:\n\n* country-aware\n* keyword-driven\n* adapted to local language & intent\n\nNow I’m trying to figure out how to position Asogenie itself.\n\nIf you’re building apps:\n\n* Would a tool focused purely on **country-level ASO generation** be valuable?\n* What would make you actually pay for something like this?\n\n**If you’re interested, here’s the App Store link:** [Asogenie](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/asogenie-ai-ekran-g%C3%B6r%C3%BCnt%C3%BCs%C3%BC/id6757458571)\n\nYou can try it for free.  \n*Quick note:* until the latest update is approved, please make sure to tap the **English** button in the country selector when testing — otherwise generation won’t start. This is already fixed and waiting for App Store review.\n\nI’d really appreciate any **honest feedback**.\n\nThanks 🙏",

If you make a manual design or copy adjustment, you can choose to **propagate that change to the same screenshot index across all other languages automatically**, so you don’t have to redo the same tweak per locale.This way you get full auto generation by default, but still keep global consistency when you need to step in manually.",

A lightweight app that lives in your menu bar fits the indie mindset.\n\nPricing: $49/year for unlimited projects. That is low enough to feel like a no-brainer but still meaningful.

They need something that removes the painful part: adapting visual assets per market.the macOS angle is intentional. I didn’t want another heavy web dashboard. Something lightweight, native, and always available felt more aligned with how indie builders actually work.\n\nThe $49/year positioning as a “day one install” tool is interesting — that framing might be stronger than marketing it as a generic AI utility.\n\nReally appreciate the thoughtful breakdown.

They’re not huge, not revenue machines, but they have unlocked potential — decent domains, some SEO groundwork, a bit of structure. Feels wasteful to just let them rot.\n\nHas anyone here successfully sold a small side project for cheap just to pass the torch?\n\nIf yes:\n\n* Where did you list it?\n* Is there a subreddit for this?\n* A marketplace for tiny indie projects?\n* Or do people just DM each other and figure it out?\n\nWould love to hear real experiences, the good, the bad, and the ugly. \n\nFeels like there should be a better “second life” ecosystem for abandoned indie projects. \n\nHappy to share what I have for liquidation for those who are interested in expanding their portfolio.",

Here is what worked for me.\n\n  \nFor the ones I sold, I listed them on SideProjectors and got a buyer within a couple weeks for both. The key was being transparent about what the project actually had (some SEO juice, a working codebase, a decent domain) vs what it needed (marketing, time, maybe a pivot). Buyers appreciated honesty over hype.\n\n  \nOther places worth checking: [Acquire.com](http://Acquire.com) if the project has any revenue at all, even small. 1KProjects for stuff under $1k. Flippa works but its noisy, you will get a lot of tire kickers. Indiemaker is newer but specifically built for this.\n\n  \nFor the projects I let die, my biggest regret is not open sourcing them. If you cant sell it, throwing it on GitHub with a good README at least gives it a second life and sometimes drives traffic back to your other stuff.\n\n  \nOne thing I learned the hard way: the longer you wait, the less a project is worth. Domains expire, dependencies get outdated, whatever small SEO you had decays. If you know you are not coming back to it, list it now even if the price is embarrassingly low. Someone paying $200 for your abandoned project is better than it sitting there costing you renewal fees.",
