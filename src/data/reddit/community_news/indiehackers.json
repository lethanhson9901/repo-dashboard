      "text": "Hear me out! I kept noticing that every knowledge/notes tool that I used eventually became its own project (in that the tool I chose to reduce overhead started creating overhead).\n\nMy short project inception story is that my dog got on some medication and I realized I needed to keep track of it. My mind immediately went to Notion, but then I realized I'd be signing myself up for an hour of tinkering to build the \"perfect\" medicine tracker. My OTHER option was to grab a medication tracking app from the app store, but I knew it'd be a hassle to find one that looked nice, worked well and didn't try to charge me a subscription fee.\n\nMy solution was to spend 100x as much time and 100x as much money (lol) on a tool to solve both of those problems.\n\nSo I built [Midline.com](http://Midline.com)\n\n* No blank databases. No custom properties. No templates.\n* Small, purpose-built modules with structure/function already decided.\n* Open it, capture something, leave.\n* Less flexible than Notion or Obsidian, but that's the point!\n\nThe bet is that most people don't actually want the sandbox environment. Not everyone wants open-world minecraft...some people want something more linear.\n\nRight now it's browser-first (mobile+desktop) but native apps with offline mode are coming in 30 days.\n\nVery early (12 hours), but hoping to get some testing eyes on it ASAP!\n\nHere are some invite codes if you want to give it a shot, please share your 3 codes for others to grab!\n\n* NU3ETYLF\n* WMK98BYR\n* UQC3TQGP\n* 4ZZ5WQH3\n* N9VURVF9\n* 9L4FYZ37\n* T3W86M8C\n* NZDASCB5\n* PEEG2KSH\n* ZUT8PSDN",

My gut says a lot of these will be structurally similar so once we’ve got a solid foundation of modules if someone makes a request that seems reasonable we can more or less just clone existing modules and adjust them as needed. \n\nBut the truth is that here before too long we will open up a little developer kit where developers can build their own modules, either just for themselves or for others to use.

The constraint of zero customization is actually a feature because it removes the decision fatigue loop.\n\nThe risk is that \"no customization\" sounds like a bug to the power users who write about productivity tools online. Your actual audience is the silent majority who just want to write stuff down. Marketing to them is harder because they don't hang out in productivity forums.",

So if I'm a project manager pre-build me a dashboard with the modules that I'm likely to need. \nIf I'm a contractor then show me a dashboard where I can track my hours etc.\n\nConnect it to specific use cases instead of just giving me a bunch of modules to add.\n\nGood luck!",

Huge congrats on launching this and putting it out there; spending 100x the time and money to avoid a $5 subscription is the most indie hacker origin story ever haha. I will leave the invite code's for others as I just paid my annual Notion renewal haha and don't want to take from another possible new customer of yours. ;) This is obviously just my opinion but I think you have a real winner here. :) Hope the launch goes great & congrats mate!",

Timestamp based notes taking for video, like we do on udemy or any other learning platform. Notes are organised per video basis. Clicking on the timestamp attached to the note will jump to that part of the video. You can also take general ideas as notes.\n\n2. Single timestamp bookmark so you can start watching a long form video from where you left like a bookmark in a novel. Even though yt provides this feature through history but what if a user turned off their history and also searching in old videos would be tedious.\n\n3. You can simply manage your notes and bookmarks through a dedicated dashboard and extension popup.\n\n4. Auto pause yt video when you change tab/window and auto play video when you come back to yt video. This will save your time when doing things like code along and following tutorials.\n\n5. Hide distraction parts like the recommended section and comments on a video so that you can focus on one video at a time.\n\n6. Extension is local first meaning it works without internet and data will be in your hand so you don't have to worry about privacy.\n\n7. No authentication is needed so try it out for free and give your feedback.",

No SaaS layer. Except inference via openai compatible provider\n\nRight now it’s mainly for power users / technical builders. I’m exploring:\n- Whether this stays personal tooling\n- Or becomes a product for people who want a “bring your own server” agent or integrate with corporate flows.\n\nCurious if anyone else here is building self-hosted AI tools, and whether you see demand beyond hackers messing with openclaw.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/kvyb/opentulpa",

Pair it with Descript for cleanup and you can produce professional-looking demos without paying anything.\n\nThe paid tool worth the money eventually: Riverside.fm if you start doing interviews or podcasts.",

I am thinking of curating it weekly depending on how much people want this kinda stuff. Though I made a post across 20+ subs, it barely received any engagement which made me question if doing this is worth my time. At the moment, it is only free services because we can put millions under free products and besides there are 1000s of lists with free products on them. I ll add tagging next to make it easier to identify offers quickly. 2 tags I can think of would be free-forever and free-limited. The rest of the tags such as webdesign, seo etc would require some kind of automation as manually this would be an impossible task not to mention error prone and not easily updatable. Any suggestions on how to go about doing this?",

Keeping it in their head as they go.\n\n**What makes it different:** It's not just an analysis tool. It's a workspace that gets smarter over time:\n\n* Paste customer feedback, interviews, metrics, anything\n* Get ranked recommendations with evidence links in \\~60 seconds\n* Generate briefs/prds/specs where every claim traces back to source quotes\n* The more context you add, the better it gets at understanding your product and making recommendations\n\nIt's also a chat-first interface. Works like a second brain that compounds knowledge as you use it.\n\n**Where I'm stuck:** I'm a senior PM/former founder. I built this for myself and it genuinely solves problems I have. But every channel is saturated with \"I built a PM tool\" posts. I can't break through the noise.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Is this a distribution problem (right product, wrong audience) or positioning problem (they see it but don't understand why they need it)?\n2. How do you get initial users when every community ignores tool announcements?\n3. Should I stop posting publicly and focus on direct outreach to PMs who write about workflows?\n\nLink: [mimir.build](http://mimir.build)\n\nLooking for honest takes.

Here's what I'd do: stop posting in broad communities where tool announcements get ignored. Instead, find 5-10 PMs who actively write about their workflow on Twitter or in niche PM communities.\n\nSend them direct, personalized messages explaining you built this for yourself as a senior PM and want feedback from people who think publicly about their process. Offer them free lifetime access in exchange for a 20 min call where they try it live with you. Those conversations will either validate your positioning or show you what's actually missing.\n\nAlso, Reddit matters more than you probably realize right now for discoverability. When someone searches Google for best PM tools for customer feedback or how to organize user interviews, Reddit threads rank top 3. The problem is you can't just post about your tool without getting downvoted.\n\nSome B2B companies handle this by using a done-for-you service like Community Mentions (https:// communitymentions .com) that gets them mentioned in the right threads without the spam risk. They do the research and posting so you show up where people are actively asking for solutions. Worth considering if you don't have bandwidth to monitor Reddit yourself while you're doing direct outreach.\n\nYour conversion isssue is likely that people see it as another AI wrapper when the real value is the compounding context engine.

Maybe even set up a newsletter similar to Lenny, just nicher targeting and all about helping first timers. \n\nAll these things take time to generate users but it's easier when you're targeting a small group and providing them with value.",

      "text": "Still here. update time.\n\n9 days ago I posted about using KironX to filter LinkedIn and skip the job boards. It worked and I got 10 interviews. But the market is brutal right now. Either they want to pay me junior rates for senior/CTO experience, or... silence. The classic “we'll call you soon.” \n\nSo I went back to plan A.\n\nIn January I entered the AWS 10,000 AIdeas Competition without expecting much. Just threw my idea in and forgot about it. Last Thursday I got an email: top 1,000 semifinalists out of 10,000.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ute5arx6p9kg1.png?width=2638&format=png&auto=webp&s=6412c1ba1f4bad29467f37efc92acac5f933aa23\n\nThat changed everything.\n\nI spent days going back and forth. Keep grinding interviews that lead nowhere, or go all-in on my own project with 12 days left to ship a prototype? And the stakes aren't just the prize, winning means AWS puts their stamp on your idea. That kind of validation changes how customers see you.\n\nYou can guess what I chose.\n\n**What I'm creating (Cirrondly):**\n\nIt's not a dashboard. It's an AI agent that connects to your AWS account, detects where you're losing money, and fixes it automatically. No charts to interpret. No action required on your part. Just a lower bill.\n\nBuilt for founders who open Cost Explorer once, get confused, and close it immediately. Indie hackers and early startups get destroyed by AWS costs. They can't afford a DevOps engineer. Cirrondly is that engineer, without the salary\n\n**Why I think I can pull this off in 12 days:**\n\nI shipped KironX fast enough to get paying customers and a CSS Winner award. I learned how to ship. I know how to distribute. And this time the mission is simple: h**elp people save money on AWS.**\n\nSimple missions ship faster.\n\nThe math is what it is: 20 days of runway, 12 days to demo. If this doesn't work, I'm back to the job boards with even less leverage. If it does, maybe I've built something real.\n\nOne phase of the competition involves public voting. I'll share the link here when the prototype is ready. A few days out.\n\nHas anyone else made a bet like this? All-in on your own thing when the \"safe\" option wasn't really safe either?  \n  \n",

Over the past few weeks, I’ve had several interviews, and I even have another one scheduled for tomorrow.\n\nBut honestly, regardless of the country I live in, the developer market feels completely broken worldwide right now. It’s so bad that it doesn’t even feel like a “should I accept junior pay or not” kind of situation anymore. It just feels collapsed.\n\nFor me, survival comes first at the moment. Getting a job is the top priority. Once I regain some stability, I plan to return to indie hacking.\n\nThe only problem is even if I do land a job, there’s still this huge anxiety that I could get laid off again at any time.

It was actually the opposite.\n\nIn the first 5 months, we gained more than 200 users. For first-time founders, that was a solid result.\n\nWe acquired them organically without spending money on ads. We sent direct messages, launched on Product Hunt, used Twitter, and explored many different channels.\n\nWe scaled traffic. We got users.\n\nBut we scaled too early.\n\nWe target more segment, instead focus to only one\n\nI scale platform with add more features\n\nThese all lead me to\n\n\\- loss focus\n\n\\- build feature that only request by 1-2 users, aftee i built they churn anyway\n\n\\- loss time build feature that not use\n\nWe loss time, loss money and end up with run out cash\n\nScaling without a strong foundation killed the startup. Later, I read several articles about this mistake and realized this is what people call premature scaling.\n\nScaling without strong product-market fit led us to build a product that people did not truly need.\n\nThat experience taught me an important lesson. Before product-market fit, a founder’s main job is to find PMF, not to scale.\n\nCurrently, I am building an SEO reporting tool that makes SEO work visible. Unlike before, I am now focused on finding product-market fit first.\n\nI am actively talking with SEO consultants to get as much feedback as possible.\n\nIf you are an SEO professional, I would love to connect and discuss how we can shape this product to better meet your needs.\n\n(Updated realted scaling in this case)",

So things like, no ads spends till we reach 100 users or a feature would only be built out once the existing users start asking for it and the threshold for that is defined as well.

If you need something a bit more custom or want to bridge the gap between web and mobile without writing tons of native code, maybe look into something like Runable for generating the initial structure or even a landing page that links to a PWA. It's not a magic bullet for a full-blown native app, but it can help get you started faster. \n\nHonestly, for a full-featured mobile app, you might eventually need some dev help, but starting with a PWA or a simpler no-code tool could be a good first step.

Validate demand first by shipping the PWA and measuring retention, then invest in native only if users need sensors or heavy offline processing. btw, I used a starter kit that already had auth, payments and design-to-code bits wired up which let me wrap and ship in days (Vibe Coding Starter Kit).",

      "text": "\"The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant.\" That's Einstein. And I think we need to start treating AI more like the faithful servant it is and less like the gift. Here's what I mean.\n\nRunning a business is just making decisions over and over. Every decision comes down to context, what do you have, what's missing, and then making the call anyway. That's it.\n\nBuilding with ai for a few years has made me see where the ceiling is. It's fast at processing information. But that's not the same as having instinct or intuition.\n\nYou hear this from people who've done deals for decades. Gut feel. Walking into a room and knowing something's off before anyone's said a word. That's pattern recognition from years of being wrong and recalibrating. AI doesn't have that layer. It can tell you what the data says. It can't tell you this deal feels wrong even though the numbers look right. That stuff lives somewhere else.\n\nHere's what I've started doing: I open fresh AI sessions constantly. Not because the old one was bad, but because I want to come at the same problem without prior context dragging me in one direction. It's like going for a walk. You step away, come back 20 minutes later, and your brain has reorganized everything. AI doesn't have an equivalent of that. It doesn't forget on purpose. So I do it manually. New session, same problem, see what comes back different.\n\nThe people I know who use AI well aren't handing it decisions. They're using it to surface information faster so they can spend more time on the part that actually matters... making the call with incomplete information. That's what business is.\nAnyone else thinking about this? Where are you drawing the line between what you hand to AI and what you keep for yourself?",

AI possesses pattern recognition abilities but lacks the fundamental human experience that drives our decision-making processes. AI systems do not have this particular ability because they cannot experience real-world consequences.\n\nYour observation about creating new sessions for research purposes is important to me. I use a similar method to test different ways of presenting my ideas to others. The same prompt leads to different results when tested in different situations. The process involves using intuition to eliminate the tendency of people to base their judgments on initial information.\n\nThe division between the two fields becomes clear to me through this statement. The use of artificial intelligence serves to create new knowledge, which helps organisations assess various choices while testing their logical frameworks. Humans should decide between different options, which require them to consider both time-related factors and human relationships.\n\nThe moment a decision has an asymmetric downside, I don’t outsource it.

So technically, each decision you make comes from the context window of your entire life/all your experiences and visual cues, without you even being aware what exactly is driving it. \n\nSo for AI to be able to mimic instinct at a level similar to ours, it would need a massive context window, which it wouldn't even be able to process because of its vulnerability to infinite loops.\n\nI mostly use AI for data gathering and/or processing, by giving it as much project/situation context as possible, like - what's important, what I'm trying to achieve, etc. And from this a really clear task or questions about the data. Only problem with research, even when telling it to cite sources to prevent hallucination, it presents a source link which looks amazingly real (nasa .gov/articlerelevanttome), but the page doesn't exist and never have, it's basically like it's going \"oh if this article existed it would be exactly what she's looking for\" lol.\n\nWe'll probably start seeing some really custom models trained on a massive context for a very specific situation but true human intuition is too complex to translate into an algorithm in my opinion.",

The type of name that makes people stop scrolling.\n\nWhy I’m selling:\n\nI’m no tech guy, but a marketing dude! I hired someone to build me this but scaling LLM-heavy products properly requires deeper technical expertise. There are some minor AI inconsistencies that a stronger operator could optimize quickly.\n\nAlso, building, scaling, and exiting online businesses is literally what I’ve been doing for the past 10 years. I enjoy the early-stage game.\n\nGrowth angles I didn’t fully execute:\n\n* Mobile app (huge opportunity)\n* Programmatic SEO at scale\n* TikTok/UGC content loops\n* Fitness influencer partnerships\n* B2B (coaches, nutritionists)\n\nThis would be ideal for:\n\n* A technical founder who wants an existing base\n* Someone bullish on AI + health\n* An indie hacker who prefers improving vs starting from zero\n\n**Costs**: Supabase database $25/m and Gemini API per call \\~$3.5/m\n\nI’m happy to share Stripe screenshots, analytics, and walk through everything transparently.\n\nNot desperate to sell, just looking for the right operator who can take it further.\n\nIf interested, comment or DM.",

I’d also document churn reasons + feature requests (even a scrappy Google Sheet or using something like InsightLab for cancel flows) so the next owner isn’t guessing why people bounce and can iterate faster instead of treating WTFood like a mysterious protein bar they found in the gym parking lot.",

      "text": "As a solo founder, I kept hitting the same wall: I wanted quick, private automations to handle repetitive stuff (like syncing leads from Sheets to CRM, queuing daily posts to X, or AI agents summarizing feedback to Slack). \n\nThese could save me hours every week, but the setup for self-hosted tools always turned into its own massive chore.\n\nI'd get excited, spin up a container, then spend evenings fighting compose files, external DB configs, volumes that wouldn't persist properly, and updates that broke things silently. The **automation solution** ended up creating more overhead than the manual work I was trying to escape. Ideas piled up in \"someday\" tabs, and I stayed stuck doing things by hand.\n\nThe insight that hit me: most of us don't need infinite customization in the hosting layer. We need something reliable, private, and low-friction – so the focus stays on building flows, not babysitting servers.\n\nThat's why I started shaping a2n.io into a self-host friendly version: one pre-built Docker image with everything embedded (Postgres + Redis), no extras required to get going. Kept it MIT licensed, no forced white-label or branding – deploy it anywhere (local machine, VPS, your choice).\n\n**Repo with the latest docs**: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\n**The deploy step that made it feel simple**:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\n**Docker pulls the image, starts the container, persists your data in the volume**.  \n\nOpen http://localhost:8080, set your admin password – drag-and-drop builder ready in under a minute.\n\n**Upgrades are seamless**:  \n\n```bash\n\ndocker pull sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\ndocker stop a2n && docker rm a2n\n\n# re-run the docker run command above\n\n```\n\nYour workflows, credentials, and history stay safe in the volume – no data wipe, no manual migrations for most updates. Takes 20 seconds, zero surprises.\n\nWhat I'm running now:\n\n\\- Visual drag-and-drop canvas  \n\n\\- **110+ nodes** covering everyday needs: Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok agents with tool calling, HTTP/SQL, JS/Python code, webhooks, schedules, files  \n\n\\- Real-time execution logs & monitoring  \n\n\\- Unlimited workflows and executions (no caps)  \n\n\\- One-click n8n flow migration (paste your JSON export – converts and runs with warnings for adaptations)  \n\n\\- Horizontal scaling (main + worker containers via compose, auto-discovery in cluster)  \n\n\\- Vertical scaling (CPU/mem limits, concurrent executions, pool sizes adjustable from UI System Monitor)  \n\n\\- Auto schema upgrades and migrations on pull  \n\nIt's not about matching every niche node out there – it's focused on the practical 80/20 that lets indie founders ship fast without the tinkering tax turning into its own project. Less overhead, more shipping.\n\nVery early days for the self-host side (repo got recent updates with scaling and migration features), but if you've felt that \"tool to save time creates more time sink\" loop, give that one command a quick test. Low risk, quick to spin up.\n\nAnyone else been in that cycle where the automation tool itself becomes the bottleneck? What's your biggest self-host frustration right now – setup complexity, upgrade pains, or something else? Sharing because those exact issues pushed me to keep simplifying. 🚀",

      "text": "I've been on this journey with **self-hosting** for a while now, trying to get private automations running for my side projects without the SaaS fee buildup or data worries. Things like pulling leads from Sheets to my CRM, auto-queuing daily posts to X, or AI agents summarizing customer feedback and pinging Slack – all ideas that could save me hours weekly, but they always stalled at the infra stage.\n\nEvery attempt started with excitement, then devolved into battling compose files, external Postgres and Redis configs, volume glitches, and updates that broke everything. I'd end up spending way too much time just getting the thing to boot, only to abandon it when scaling or migrations became a hassle. \n\nThe **tool to automate my life** was turning into its own endless side project, and my motivation would tank.\n\nThe turning point was realizing I needed something simpler – not a full enterprise beast, but something focused on the **80/20** that actually ships for solo founders. So I reworked the engine behind a2n.io into a Docker-friendly version, embedding Postgres 16 and Redis so no external services are needed upfront. Added practical stuff like one-click n8n flow migration (paste your JSON export, it converts and runs with warnings for any adaptations), horizontal scaling (main instance + worker containers via compose, auto-discovery in cluster), vertical scaling (adjust CPU/mem limits, concurrent executions, pool sizes directly from the UI System Monitor), automatic schema upgrades and migrations on pull (DB tools handle changes seamlessly), and a free lifetime license key (head to the updated GitHub page or a2n.io/signup → Settings → Docker License to generate it) to unlock those features like custom nodes, DB backup/restore/migrate, and advanced monitoring.\n\n**Repo with all the updated details (check the horizontal.yml template, license activation guide, changelog for scaling/migration deets):** https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nThe deploy step that finally let me move past the frustration:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nDocker pulls the image, starts it up, persists everything in the volume. Hit http://localhost:8080, set your admin password – drag-drop builder ready in seconds. No compose yaml required at the start.\n\n**Upgrades are seamless now**:  \n\n```bash\n\ndocker pull sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\ndocker stop a2n && docker rm a2n\n\n# re-run the docker run command above\n\n```\n\nYour flows, credentials, and history stay safe in the volume. Schema upgrades and migrations happen automatically (free license unlocks the full DB tools if needed). I've done this a bunch – 20 seconds, no surprises or data loss.\n\nWhat it's been like since:\n\n\\- Familiar visual canvas  \n\n\\- **110+ nodes** for real workflows: Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok agents with tool calling, HTTP/SQL, JS/Python code, webhooks, schedules, files, and more  \n\n\\- Real-time logs & monitoring – failures show immediately  \n\n\\- No white-label requirements – deploy anywhere (local, VPS), it's fully yours  \n\n\\- Unlimited workflows/executions (hosted free tier caps at 100/mo, self-run none)  \n\n\\- One-click n8n import – no rebuild hassle  \n\n\\- Horizontal & vertical scaling from UI  \n\n\\- Auto schema upgrades/migrations  \n\nIt's not chasing thousands of niche nodes – honed for the high-ROI stuff that saves time without the overhead. For bigger loads, external DB/Redis + proxy is easy to layer on.\n\nThe real unlock? I actually finish and run automations now, instead of letting setup kill the vibe. Less stalled ideas, more focus on building.\n\nIf you've been in a similar self-host loop, that one command is worth testing. Super low-risk.\n\nWhat's been your biggest self-host roadblock lately – compose complexity, scaling pains, migration rework, upgrade fears, or something else? Sharing because those exact frustrations pushed me to keep simplifying this. The free license on the GitHub page unlocks a ton if you check it out. 🚀",

      "text": "A couple months back I was deep in the **self-host everything** phase for my side hustles. Wanted private automations: lead pulls from Sheets to CRM, daily X post queues, AI agents summarizing feedback straight to Slack. No recurring SaaS fees, full data control, unlimited runs – the dream.\n\nBut the execution was a nightmare. \nFriday night: full energy, **This weekend I nail it.** \nSaturday: compose up → connection refused, auth fails.  \nHours configuring external Postgres, Redis, volumes, secrets.  \nSunday: one flow sorta works, update breaks queue, deep in **n8n docker volume** searches at 4 PM. Motivation crashes, tab closes. Ideas stay half-baked.\n\nThe hidden cost was brutal – those unfinished automations kept costing me hours weekly. Setup friction beat any subscription I was trying to escape.\n\nAfter enough ruined weekends, I got tired of it and reworked the engine behind **a2n.io** (the hosted version I use daily) into a single Docker image. Embedded Postgres 16 + Redis, pre-built, zero extras for starters. Added a one-click n8n flow migration – paste your JSON export, it converts and runs (with minor tweaks if needed). Game-changer for anyone tired of rebuilding from scratch.\n\nRepo with steps/docs: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nThe command that finally worked:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n```\n\nDocker pulls, starts, persists data in the volume. Hit http://localhost:8080, set admin password – drag-drop builder ready in under a minute. No compose file, no separate containers.\n\nUpgrades turned out smoother than expected:  \n```bash\ndocker pull sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\ndocker stop a2n && docker rm a2n\n# re-run the docker run command\n```\nFlows, credentials, history stay safe in the volume. No schema migrations for patches, no data loss. I've done this 10+ times – 20 seconds, no surprises.\n\nWhat it's been delivering since:\n\n- Visual canvas that feels intuitive  \n- **110+ nodes** covering high-value stuff: Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok agents with tool calling, HTTP/SQL, JS/Python code, webhooks, schedules, files  \n- Real-time logs & monitoring – failures don't hide  \n- No forced white-label/branding – deploy local or on a cheap VPS, fully yours  \n- Unlimited workflows/executions (hosted free tier caps at 100/mo, self-run has none)  \n- One-click n8n import – massive time-saver for existing flows  \n\nIt's not an enterprise node monster yet – focused on practical 80/20 for indie use. For heavy scale, external DB/Redis + proxy is easy to add.\n\nThe shift? I actually complete and run automations now instead of abandoning them. Less unfinished-tab guilt, more time on growth.\n\nIf self-host setup or n8n migration pain has kept you from owning your stack, that one command is worth a quick test. Low-risk to try.\n\nWhat's your biggest self-host blocker lately – compose hell, upgrade anxiety, migration rework, or weekend burnout? Sharing because those exact pains drove me to keep simplifying this. 🚀",

So here it is.\n\nThis is the design. Not a mockup of a wishlist, these are the actual screens I'm shipping for the AWS Competition prototype.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3t57kx5pu8lg1.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=3abe9d76afb08a0c086c5d08de87a4a9e36fc309\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/avg69zhru8lg1.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b7366ac3ec332894f751f6f347c93f9accb6b38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2d7x7hnsu8lg1.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f7cdb8ba1479066079b7ab99321ebd99b74f7b\n\nThe core idea: you ask Cirrondly a question about your AWS costs in plain English. It connects to your account, finds exactly what's wasting money, and lets you fix it in one click.\n\nNo Cost Explorer. No charts. No DevOps degree required.\n\nThe diagnosis screen above? That's an AI agent that found $1,120/month in savings across 3 services in under a minute. Idle EC2 instances running at 2% CPU. 1.5TB of unattached EBS storage. Outdated snapshots. All real waste, all fixable.\n\nThe \"Shut down instance / Keep running\" screen is my favorite. Because that's the moment that matters: the agent found something, explained it clearly, and now you decide. No meetings, no graph that explains everything and nothing, no need for a tutorial or an expert. No digging through consoles. For me, this is the disconnect button the cloud always needed.\n\n17 days left. The product isn't live yet but the waitlist is open: [cirrondly.com](http://cirrondly.com).\n\nIf you're burning money on AWS and want early access, drop a comment or DM me. I'm giving the first 10 people free access when I ship\n\n",

I was the CTO who had to do everything. Then, when I was CTO, I saw the founder who wanted to make an investment call and didn't know how to calculate how much he would spend on 10 clients.\nThen there's the axis of personal experience: how painful it is to spend a lot of money because you left something connected and forgot about it, or simply don't know how to set up cost alerts.\nThen there's the question of asking. I created an account on X, posted for several months, and someone told me they had that pain when they logged into AWS Cost. I found it understandable. I was building something and wanted to spend less.\nThe last two are validation by searching how many people have complained about surprise bills.",

Don’t sell the product, sell the outcome (“I’ll find you wasted spend in 20 mins”). Record objections. That feedback will sharpen both the product and the landing page fast.\n\nAlso, be careful with the “one-click fix” promise, trust is everything when you’re touching infra. The UX needs to scream safety and reversibility.\n\nRunway at this stage isn’t about shipping more features. It’s about getting 3 people to say, “I’d pay for this right now.”",

      "text": "I was in that classic indie trap for a while: I had all these automations I wanted to run privately – pulling leads from Sheets to my CRM, auto-posting daily content to X from a queue, AI agents summarizing customer replies and dropping them in Slack. Self-hosting was the goal – no SaaS creep, full data control, unlimited everything.\n\nBut every time I tried, it fell apart fast. Compose files exploding, external Postgres and Redis refusing to connect, volumes getting messed up on restart, then an update wiping my progress. I'd spend hours (sometimes days) just getting the UI to load, only to abandon it when something broke. The **I'll fix it tomorrow** pile grew, and so did the manual work I hated.\n\nThe irony? I was building tools to save time, but the infra overhead was eating more than any subscription. I realized the setup was the real blocker – not the ideas.\n\nSo I started stripping down the engine I use for **a2n.io** (my hosted playground) to remove every pain point. Embedded Postgres and Redis so no external services needed at first. Pre-built the image. Added one-click n8n flow migration (paste your JSON export – it converts, adapts unsupported nodes with warnings, and runs). Then layered in horizontal scaling (main + worker containers via compose, auto-discovery in cluster), vertical scaling (tune CPU/mem limits, concurrent executions, pool sizes right from the UI System Monitor), automatic schema upgrades/migrations on pull (DB tools handle schema changes), and a free lifetime license key (generate at a2n.io/signup → Settings → Docker License) to unlock those self-hosted tools like custom nodes, DB backup/restore/migration, and monitoring.\n\nRepo with all the updated docs (check the horizontal.yml template, license activation guide, changelog): https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\n**The deploy that finally broke the cycle for me**:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n```\n\nDocker pulls it, starts up, persists everything in the volume. Hit http://localhost:8080, set your admin – drag-drop canvas ready in under a minute. No compose yaml upfront, no separate containers.\n\n**Upgrades are now seamless**:  \n```bash\ndocker pull sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\ndocker stop a2n && docker rm a2n\n# re-run the docker run command\n```\nData stays safe in the volume. Schema upgrades happen automatically (license unlocks DB tools for any manual tweaks), no wipe-outs. I've done it multiple times – 20 seconds, no surprises.\n\n**What it's been like since**:\n\n- Visual builder with the feel I like  \n- **110+ nodes** for real workflows: Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok agents with tool calling, HTTP/SQL, JS/Python code, webhooks, schedules, files, and more  \n- Real-time logs & monitoring – failures show up immediately  \n- No white-label forced – deploy local, VPS, anywhere, it's yours  \n- Unlimited workflows/executions (hosted free tier caps at 100/mo, self-run none)  \n- One-click n8n import – huge for switching without rebuild  \n- Horizontal scaling: 1 main + N workers, shared DB/Redis  \n- Vertical scaling: UI sliders for resources/concurrent limits  \n- Auto schema upgrades/migrations – license unlocks full DB tools  \n\nIt's not trying to out-node-count enterprise tools yet – focused on the 80/20 that saves time for solo founders. For bigger loads, external DB/Redis + proxy is straightforward.\n\nThe change has been night and day: I finish automations instead of abandoning them. More shipped value, less infra guilt.\n\nIf setup hell or migration rework has kept your workflows stuck in \"someday,\" that one command is worth a spin. Low stakes to test.\n\nWhat's your current self-host blocker – compose complexity, scaling pains, migration hassle, upgrade fears, or something else? Your stories are why I kept cutting the fat on this. Check the repo for the free license unlock – it's helped a lot. 🚀",
