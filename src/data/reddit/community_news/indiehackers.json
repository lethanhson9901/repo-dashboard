It works like a public leaderboard of startups and directories, but only with real, validated views that update live.\n\nNo edited screenshots, no made‑up metrics. The numbers on each public page come from the same script (or GA4) that powers the site’s own analytics, so what you see is what actually happened.\n\nThe main reason this exists is that founders constantly struggle with proof: some oversell their traction with nice‑looking dashboards, while others undersell it because they have no simple, credible way to showcase their real traffic. (I did)\n\nMy dream long term is to have blogs and directories listed there, since **views** are literally their business model, and hosting those numbers on a neutral third‑party page would be insanely OP for transparency and trust with their users.\n\nWould love ideas on things like:  \n– Should there be space for founder notes or context around spikes and dips?  \n– As a founder, would you feel comfortable linking to a public traffic page from your landing, newsletter, or launch post?\n\nOpen to any feedback. Right now, TrustViews is already being used in the wild: \n\n**82 Websites Verifying A Total Of 156,517 Views.**",

This could lead to a bias since only the successful ones will verify.\n\nI’m not trying to find flaws; I'm genuinely interested in your thoughts on this.\n\nAdditionally, the GA4 integration is clever.

If the idea is good, we can learn from it! \n\nI think this will be great for newsletters or product platforms who are looking for sponsorships can verify their \"views\" or \"reads\" to their potential advertisers - one way for you to explore revenue on this too.  \n  \nBut one thing maybe you can consider - perhaps change the UI or layout abit? So people don't really relate it too much to trustmrr.  \n  \nGood luck!",

Here's how I approach balancing product development and SEO as a solo founder:\n\nProduct first:  Always prioritize building a valuable product.  That's the foundation.\n\nLaser focus SEO: Don't try to rank for everything. Pick 1-2 highly relevant keywords.\n\nBatch content: Dedicate specific blocks of time (e.g., weekends) for content creation.\n\nAI as research: Use AI tools (like Jasper or ChatGPT) for keyword research, competitor analysis, and outlining. Don't rely on them for writing the core content - that's still your expertise.\n\nLow-effort SEO: Focus on foundational SEO: title tags, meta descriptions, internal linking.\n\nDon't strive for perfection:  \"Good enough\" is often better than \"perfect\" when you're a solo founder.\n\nTrack & iterate: Monitor your traffic and adjust your strategy based on what's working.\n\nEssentially, treat SEO as a supporting function, not the primary focus.",

But your FluidCalendar win came from being in the right place at the right time with something people actually wanted.  \n  \nWith 20+ products, you're sitting on a goldmine of solutions to real problems. The challenge is connecting them to the people who need them RIGHT NOW. Some ideas: Double down on what worked - that FluidCalendar post worked, can you do more posts like it sharing the story, the tech, the journey? Pick your top 3 products and really focus distribution there since 20 products means scattered attention. Find the watering holes - for FluidCalendar it might be productivity Twitter, , indie hacker communities. Build in public more - your story is genuinely interesting, 20+ products, a viral moment, still grinding. People root for that.  \n  \nI'd love to dig into your products and help you figure out which ones have the most distribution potential. DM me if you want to chat!",

It’s not just “use the tools.” There’s an upfront tax. You have to mess around with prompts, figure out a workflow that doesn’t fight you, decide what’s worth automating and what’s better left manual. Once it clicks though, it starts compounding fast.\n\nMy setup is honestly pretty basic: Perplexity when I need quick research or a sanity check, ChatGPT for outlines and reshaping drafts, Cursor while I’m building so the product and the content move together, and n8n for the glue stuff (publishing, syncing drafts, tracking ideas, all the boring admin).\n\nSo I don’t really “balance” product vs content anymore. I try to smash them into the same loop. Build something, write as I go, ship, let automation mop up the rest.\n\nThe tools help, sure. But the real unlock was treating it like a system you design, not a pile of apps you install and hope works out.",

You can use AI tools to handle the heavy lifting of keyword research and initial drafting. The key is to provide the unique insights yourself while letting the AI manage the SEO formatting and internal linking. This can cut your 4 hours down to 45 minutes.

      "text": "**Note: FOCUS is mobile apps not web.**\n\nMy post about finding an exposed OpenAI key got a lot of responses asking \"okay but how do I actually fix this?\"\n\nHere's the simplest setup that works.\n\n**The problem:** Your app needs to call OpenAI. If you put the API key in your app code, anyone can extract it. Doesn't matter if it's in .env files or environment variables. Once it's in the bundle, it's public.\n\n**The fix:** Your app calls YOUR server. Your server calls OpenAI. The key never leaves your server.\n\n    App → Your Backend → OpenAI\n            (key lives here)\n\n**What you need:**\n\n1. A cheap VPS (Hetzner €3.29/month, DigitalOcean $4/month, or free tier from Railway/Render)\n2. A simple proxy that forwards requests\n\n**The code (Go, \\~50 lines):**\n\n    func proxyOpenAI(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        // Your key stays on the server\n        apiKey := os.Getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n        \n        // Forward the request to OpenAI\n        req, _ := http.NewRequest(r.Method, \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\", r.Body)\n        req.Header.Set(\"Authorization\", \"Bearer \"+apiKey)\n        req.Header.Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n        \n        resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)\n        if err != nil {\n            http.Error(w, \"API error\", 500)\n            return\n        }\n        defer resp.Body.Close()\n        \n        // Return response to your app\n        w.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n        io.Copy(w, resp.Body)\n    }\n\n**Your app calls:**\n\n    fetch('https://your-server.com/api/chat', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + userToken },\n      body: JSON.stringify({ \n        app_id: 'my-fitness-app',  // identifies your app\n        message: userInput \n      })\n    })\n\n**Add basic auth so random people can't use your proxy:**\n\nYour app authenticates users (Supabase, Firebase, whatever). Your backend verifies that token before proxying. Now only your logged-in users can make requests.\n\n**Scaling to multiple apps:**\n\nI run one backend that serves multiple apps. Each app gets its own isolated SQLite database based on the app\\_id:\n\n    /data/\n    ├── noteapp/\n    │   └── cache.db\n    ├── fitness-app/\n    │   └── cache.db\n    └── recipe-app/\n        └── cache.db\n\nThe backend routes requests to the right database:\n\n    func getDB(appID string) (*DB, error) {\n        dbPath := fmt.Sprintf(\"./data/%s/cache.db\", appID)\n        return sql.Open(\"sqlite3\", dbPath)\n    }\n\nOne server. Multiple apps. Complete data isolation. If one app has a bug, it can't touch another app's data.\n\n**Cost:** I run this on a €3.29/month Hetzner VPS. Uses 10% CPU, under 500MB RAM.

A lot of top-of-funnel searches are getting answered directly by AI, so generic SEO content is getting squeezed.

Last time i tried, I'd end up spending 100 and only getting 10 in return.  It just didn't stack up.  \n\nOrganic SEO on the other hand has been the engine that has driven all of our growth for past 5 years.  People searching for the phases we target are already warm and conversion rates are about 6% (new users landing to paid subscribers).  In contrast Ads never went above 1%.\n\nThat said, things have shifted since September last year, that is impacting organic  and causing us headaches.  We have been seeing a steady decline in traffic volumes, especially from google (down about 40%).  In google search console our impressions are growing, our average position is staying level, but our clicks are declining rapidly.  I can only think that this is because of the AI overviews and search users relying more and more on those.  That is making the Organic SEO even more competitive!  Rather than having to get in to the top 5 on google, now you have to be in the top 1 as that seems to be all the AI search results seem to be including in their responses.  \n\nTimes are a changing!",

What counts as “successful”\n\nLet's go straigth to the numbers, concretly: \n\n* get 2 upvotes and you are better than 50%\n* get 8 upvotes and you are better than 90%\n\nAsk your friends to support you you get to that top 10% !\n\n2. What winners have in common\n\nAcross categories, the successful ones share:\n\n* A very specific “do this one job” promise in the tagline. (in the tagline)\n* Clear audience and use case you can understand in three seconds. (in the tagline, if not description)\n* Their categories reinforce the positioning instead of trying to cover everything (max 3)\n\nIf you want more breakdowns like this, that is exactly what the newsletter goes into each week, using fresh data from startuphunt.io.​\n\n3. What the failed ones share\n\nThe low‑traction launches also share patterns, just in the opposite direction.​\n\n* Vague promises like “platform”, “solution”, or “experience” without accuracy.\n* Taglines that describe features or tech, not the outcome for a real person.​\n* Numerous categories...\n\nMany of them are not bad ideas, they are just impossible to “get” fast enough for someone scrolling past.​\n\nIf this kind of data‑driven teardown helps, this post is part of a newsletter series powered by [startuphunt.io](http://startuphunt.io), where more datasets and patterns are shared for founders.​",

Would you personally pay for something like this?\n2. What would make it worth paying for vs not?\n3. If you wouldn’t pay, what’s the main reason?\n\nNot launching or selling anything, just validating whether this solves a real enough problem before building.\n\nThanks for the honest feedback 🙏\n\n",

I'd consider paying if it consistently saved me 30+ minutes daily and led to quality job matches\n\n2. Worth paying if the conversion rate from alert to actual gig is notably higher than manual searching\n\n3. Main hesitation would be whether the filters can truly capture nuanced requirements vs just keyword matching\n\n\n\nOne suggestion: maybe offer a free tier with basic filters to let people test the accuracy before committing?

Upwork provides basic filtering on keywords, pay range & skills only and they’re slow, not always instant and it is very costly, you need to buy $20/mo plan.\n2. Most third-party tools sit around $8–$20 and are often unreliable. The idea here is pocket friendly + more reliability.\n3. It looks easy to clone, but running this at scale is actually infra-heavy (proxies, etc.), which is why many bots die.\n4.

So offline wins for small/medium datasets, but longer training (big CSV or Pro with NAS) heats up the phone more – that's why Lite limits epochs and we plan checkpointing + early stopping.\n\n\n\nSuper curious – what phone do you have? If you want to test the beta (APK + Docker backend) and share your battery numbers, I'd love to hear! DM me for the link.\n\n\n\nThanks again! 🚀",

I’m specifically looking for examples with a real backend, since token management becomes tricky when client and server are separate.\n\nIf you know any good reference projects or repos, please share.
