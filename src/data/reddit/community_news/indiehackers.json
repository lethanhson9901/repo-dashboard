A platform where you can prompt to generate motion graphics videos. You can upload assets, drop in image references for inspiration, and it generates the video. Planning to add video to video generation later.\n\nI actually use this myself. I could never crack motion graphics with traditional tools. This finally works for me. So I know the problem is real, at least for people like me.\n\nBut here's where I'm stuck again.\n\nHow do I find the right channels this time? I don't want to just spray and pray on Twitter again. I want to be more intentional about where I show up.\n\nHow do I know when I've actually found my ICP? With my last products I thought I knew who I was building for but the people who signed up were completely different from who I expected.\n\nFor those who figured out distribution as an indie hacker, what actually worked? Not the stuff that sounds good in theory but what actually moved the needle for you?\n\nAppreciate any honest takes.",

Shipping was never my problem either, it was always getting clarity on why people didn’t convert once they landed.\n\nOne thing I learned the hard way is that distribution and ICP get a lot clearer when you watch real people use the product cold. In my case, I thought I knew who it was for, but first-time users kept getting stuck, hitting edge cases, or interpreting things differently than I expected. That mismatch killed conversion way more than channel choice.\n\nLately I’ve been doing short product vibe tests for founders to surface trust issues, UX friction, and early edge cases before trying to scale distribution. It’s helped sanity-check ICP assumptions without spray-and-pray posting.\n\nIf it’s useful, happy to take a quick look at yours. This is what I’m working on: [breakmy.app](http://breakmy.app)\n\nCurious though, who actually used your last products versus who you thought you were building for?",

You should still create lower-effort \"build in public\" posts on X so that you can engage with a couple of other builders on X, but this is not where your traffic will come from. When you're early, you should fully focus on cold outreach. Find your target audience (either X, Reddit, LinkedIn etc.) and send them cold DMs. This starts 1:1 conversations which help you build relationships, validate your message and offer, get qualitative feedback and ask for testimonials. This is how you get your first paying customers and how you get real signals that you can use to improve your product and offer, and narrow down your ICP.\n\nIf you're having trouble finding your ideal ICP, you can use Bazzly which will find and reach out to your target audience on Reddit.",

I found that joining those spots and just listening first helped me spot who was actually frustrated with tools like After Effects. Then, when I shared, it felt more like helping than selling.

Most gave lukewarm responses or said they'd stick with what they use now.\n\nBut 8 people got visibly excited. Started asking when they could use it. One guy asked if he could pay to get early access.\n\nThat's when it clicked. My first two products failed because nobody actually wanted them badly enough. I was solving problems that weren't painful enough to pay for.\n\nDistribution didn't matter because the product didn't matter.\n\nHere's what I'd do: talk to 20-30 potential users before you build more. Ask what they use now, what frustrates them, if they'd pay for your solution. If most don't care or give vague answers, you're building the wrong thing again.\n\nOnce you have people pulling the product out of your hands, distribution becomes easy. They tell their friends. They post about it. You don't need to spray and pray.\n\nBuild something people desperately want first. Channels come after.",

It's a testing volume problem. the algorithm updates constantly and if you post once a day for a few weeks you will only see minimal traction and conclude distribution is hard. But that is because people underestimate the volume required to stay relevant in 2026. most founders our team has worked with have never run enough experiments to actually learn what works for their specific product and audience.\n\nFor a motion graphics tool, TikTok, Instagram Reels, and Facebook are where I'd focus. Short before/after transformations perform extremely well for creative tools. Something like \"I can't use After Effects so I built this\" grabs attention.\n\nYour founder story is great for building connection and getting people to care about you BUT what actually drives conversions is other people showing up on camera talking about your product. Real users explaining how it solved their problem. That's what gets people to buy. (of course you love your product, youre the founder! people want to see what everyday users have to say)\n\nThink about it this way. Research shows it takes somewhere between 7 to 13 touchpoints before someone makes a purchase decision. Most people see your product once, think \"that's cool,\" and forget about it. You need to keep showing up in their feed through multiple pieces of content from multiple angles before they actually convert. Same for sales systems are founded upon this as a lead goes through the funnel. \n\nStop guessing and start tracking. When you get signups, ask two questions. What do you do? And what were you trying to solve when you found us? The patterns will emerge fast.\n\nYou said the people who signed up for your last products were different than expected. That's actually useful data. What were they? That might tell you something about where to look now.\n\n**We have worked with over 50+ brands and the only thing that will turn your socials into revenue is UGC in mass VOLUME and ITERATION**. The founders we work with see a huge increase in MRR because  our distribution isn't running 10 experiments: we're running 600-1500 experiments monthly. of course, that is alot for a founder to do but you can take the lesson:\n\nyou want to be making as much diversified content as possible: Different hooks, different formats, different creators, different audiences. You need to treat marketing as systematic testing until you find what converts, then you double down hard on the winners.\n\nThe hook piece is especially important. You can have the same product, same creator, same platform, but swap the hook and get completely different results. \"Watch me make a logo animation\" versus \"I failed at After Effects for 3 years until I tried this\" will perform totally differently even if they show the same thing.\n\nAnd when something works, don't move on. Scale it. If a certain angle or format or creator style is getting traction, run more variations of that. Most people find one thing that works and then go try something new instead of milking the winner.\n\nGet real users making content about your tool. Even just 5 or 10 people posting honest reviews about how they use it will outperform you posting founder updates every day. That social proof stacks up and hits people multiple times from different voices.\n\nWhat's your current content output look like? And who were those unexpected signups from your previous products?",

For motion graphics, that’s often Discords, subreddits, YouTube comments, Gumroad audiences, Notion/Canva power users — not “startup Twitter.”\n* **ICP clarity usually shows up in behavior, not demographics.** When someone signs up and *immediately* uses it without hand-holding, that’s a signal. Double down on those people, even if they’re not who you imagined.\n* **One channel > many.** Pick one place where you can be genuinely useful (sharing workflows, tearing down videos, recreating effects) and show up consistently. If it converts even a little, you’re onto something.\n\nAlso: the fact that *you* use it is a good start — now find 5–10 people who look nothing like founders and see if they stick. Distribution gets easier once usage is obvious.\n\nCurious to see how this evolves.",

Find 10-15 accounts with 20k+ followers who talk to your audience. Turn on notifications. Reply early with genuine insight. One good reply can get more eyeballs than a month of your own posts.\n\nYour posts are for credibility when people click your profile. Replies are for reach.\n\n**2. You find your ICP through conversations, not assumptions.**\n\nYou said the people who signed up were different from who you expected. That's actually useful data. Go talk to them. Ask why they signed up, what problem they were trying to solve, where they hang out online.\n\nYour ICP isn't who you imagine. It's who actually shows up. Then you go find more of those people.\n\nFor motion graphics, I'd start by asking: who makes motion graphics today and hates it? Marketers? YouTubers? Agencies?

The \"free work\" offers are usually win-win when approached correctly - the person offering gets portfolio pieces and real-world experience, the person receiving gets free help with something they'd otherwise pay for or skip entirely.\n\nThe catch most people miss: you get what you scope. If you approach these with \"can you review my landing page,\" you'll get surface-level feedback. If you approach with \"here's my landing page, my target customer is X, my main CTA is Y, I'm seeing Z% bounce rate - what's not working?\" you'll get actionable insights.\n\nThe other pattern I've noticed: the people offering free work often become paid service providers later. If someone does a great job on a free automation for you, they're now a known quantity when you need paid work done. Relationship building works both ways.\n\nOne thing to watch out for - some of these offers are lead gen funnels disguised as free help. Nothing wrong with that, but worth knowing going in.",

More money = more validation. If no one's buying it, refine it. Cuz it's even a smaller chance a random will find you and buy it online.\n\nIf you are not comfortable doing in-person sales, time to learn.

Probably worthless. Most will bounce.\n\n40k verified emails of startup founders from the last 6 months who opted in? That's gold if you're selling to founders.\n\nAlso be careful with how you use them. Sending cold emails to scraped lists can get you blacklisted fast. Most email providers will shut you down if your bounce rate or spam complaints are too high.\n\nWhat are you planning to do with them?",

      "text": "I see a lot of people struggling with moving past the $100 MRR milestone, so I’m sharing the exact sequence I used to go from $0 to $600 without an audience or paid ads.\n\n**1) Getting the first customers**\n\nI didn’t create content or try to build an audience first. This is too slow. I didn’t even launch on Product Hunt (in fact I still haven’t launched there). Instead, I reached out directly to people who were clearly my target audience and offered them to try out my tool for free.\n\nThose conversations did two things at once:\n\n* I got people to try out my tool even tho I didn’t have any social proof\n* I got to understand exactly what kind of solution are they looking for\n\nOnce their free trial would end, I’d see if they convert. If not, I’d reach out again and ask why. All this feedback made me understand in which direction to take the product, how to position, and how to price. Whenever I’d get an insight, I’d implement it, and continue with reaching out to people. And eventually, I got my first couple of paying customers.\n\n**2) Getting to $100 MRR**\n\nThe approach above is how I got to $100 MRR and my first testimonials I could put on my landing page. But once I hit the $100 mark, I noticed something important: users were churning.\n\nSo instead of doing more outreach, I paused and switched focus to talking to people who canceled to understand why. Based on what they’d tell me, I’d implement changes, then go back to doing outreach to see if those changes actually made a difference. This loop of feedback + reiteration lasted 3 months.\n\nBy the end of it, I had:\n\n* better offer\n* better landing page\n* better activation\n* higher signups\n* lower churn\n\nAt this point, my funnel finally felt healthy, so it made sense to go all-in on marketing again.\n\n**3) Growing to $600 MRR**\n\nOnce the funnel felt healthy and users were actually sticking around, I went back to doing cold outreach and that alone got me to around $200 MRR.\n\nAt this point, I had a solid product, a working outreach system and had learned valuable strategies and insights I could share with my target audience. That’s when creating content started to make sense.\n\nI took real lessons and wins and started sharing them on X and Reddit. Since these lessons were based on my real experience, they were actually valuable and resonated with my audience. Those posts brought in more traffic and customers, which would give me new lessons and insights, which I could use to create new content. And this loop helped add $100 MRR every week.\n\nSo long story short, keep talking to your ideal customers, keep iterating on your offer, and keep repeating this until things click. Once they do, that’s when you start stacking other marketing channels.\n\nIf you want to see proof and the actual timeline of my growth, you can [see it here.](https://trustmrr.com/startup/bazzly)\n\nHappy to answer any questions or go deeper so you can apply this to your SaaS!",

Most people try to do content first because it feels safer than cold outreach, but you end up writing content without understanding what actually resonates because you haven't talked to enough customers yet.\n\n  \nOne thing i'd add: the transition from outreach to content works because you've earned the insights. When you share \"lessons learned\" without the learning, it reads like generic advice. When you share lessons that cost you 3 months of churn conversations, people can tell the difference.\n\n  \nSolid playbook.",

The part about pausing outreach to fix churn is something most people skip, and it's probably the most important step.\n\nI'm building a native Mac/iOS app right now and went through a similar loop. My first version had decent signups but terrible retention because I built what I *thought* users wanted instead of what they actually needed. Spent two months just doing calls with churned users and realized the core problem was completely different from what I assumed.\n\nThe content flywheel you describe in step 3 is real. Once you have genuine stories from building and iterating, the content basically writes itself. I started sharing little workflow tips related to my app's problem space on Reddit and Twitter, and it brings in way more qualified leads than any cold outreach I've done.\n\nOne thing I'd add: for mobile/desktop apps specifically, App Store optimization compounds nicely alongside the content strategy. Good reviews from your early feedback-loop users give you a foundation that keeps working even when you're not actively marketing.",

Plus custom commission rates, with a simple dashboard so creators can track earnings themselve, and yes it's stripe-native tracking, so it scales past spreadsheets without becoming a mess as you scale.

If you don't have that flow yet, build it first before worrying about affiliate software.\n\nFor actual install attribution (knowing which creator drove which download), you'd need something like Branch or AppsFlyer — neither are free. But honestly, at early stage just ask users \"how did you hear about us?\" during signup and manually match it. Works fine when you're dealing with <50 creators.",

      "text": "I have a theory about why so many founders get stuck in the \"False Start.\"\n\nIt’s not because we aren't smart. It’s because we are chemically addicted to the Yellow Hat.\n\nIn the 1980s, Dr. Edward de Bono invented a framework called \"Six Thinking Hats.\" The idea is that the human brain (and now, the AI brain) struggles to do everything at once.\n\nYou can’t be creative and critical at the exact same time.\n\nSo, he separated thinking into six distinct modes:\n\n* ⚪ The White Hat: Data & Facts. \"What do the numbers say?\"\n* 🔴 The Red Hat: Emotion & Intuition. \"Does this feel exciting?\"\n* 🟡 The Yellow Hat: Optimism. \"Why will this work?\"\n* 🟢 The Green Hat: Creativity. \"What are the alternatives?\"\n* ⚫ The Black Hat: Judgment & Caution. \"Why will this fail?\"\n* 🔵 The Blue Hat: Control. \"Are we following the process?\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0l99fnz8ghhg1.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=2697ea5d56fff7c0f706da5f68883278a16a6b03\n\n**Here's the problem**:\n\nWhen you come up with a startup idea, you are usually wearing the Red Hat (Excitement).\n\nWhen you pitch an idea to ChatGPT (or a supportive friend), they instantly put on the Yellow Hat (Support) and the Green Hat (Ideation). They tell you it’s a \"great initiative.\" They list the benefits and 10 more features you could build. They feed your excitement.\n\nYou feel good. So you start building.\n\nBut nobody put on the Black Hat.\n\nNobody asked: \"What happens if the API costs triple?\" or \"Why would a user switch from Excel to this?\"\n\nYou build a product based on Yellow Hat energy, only to get crushed by Black Hat reality three months later.\n\n**Why ChatGPT can't help you here:**\n\nChatGPT is trained to be helpful and agreeable. It's optimized for user satisfaction. When you're excited about an idea, it mirrors that excitement because that's what makes you happy.\n\nIt's not being malicious. It's doing exactly what it was trained to do: support you.\n\nBut support isn't what you need on Day 1. You need someone to attack your idea. You need the Black Hat.\n\n**What I do now:**\n\nBefore I build anything, I force myself to spend 10 minutes in pure Black Hat mode.\n\nI pretend I'm a hater trying to destroy my idea. I ask:\n\n* What's the fatal flaw I'm ignoring?\n* What assumption will break me?\n* Why would this fail even if I execute perfectly?\n\nIt's uncomfortable. My brain fights it. But 2 out of 3 ideas collapse under Black Hat pressure.\n\nAnd that's good. Better to kill a fragile idea in 10 minutes than after 4 months of building.\n\n**Try this today:**\n\nLook at the project you're working on right now. You've probably spent weeks in Yellow Hat mode (thinking about launch, revenue, growth).\n\nPut on the Black Hat for 10 minutes. Be ruthless. If you were a skeptical investor or a competitor, where would you strike?\n\nIf your idea survives 10 minutes of the Black Hat, you might actually have something.",

Tear this apart.\" Works surprisingly well. The key is making the persona specific — vague instructions like \"be critical\" get softened by its training, but a defined character with motivation holds up better.\n\nThat said, your 10-minute solo Black Hat exercise is probably still more valuable. There's something about your own brain generating the objections that makes them stick. When ChatGPT does it, it feels like reading criticism. When you do it yourself, you actually feel the uncomfortable \"oh shit\" moment where an assumption crumbles.\n\nThe Yellow Hat addiction thing is real though.

Repo here: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nOne-liner to spin it up:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nHit http://localhost:8080 and you're in. Built-in embedded DB + Redis so no external services needed for quick tests. For real use, just pass your own Postgres/Redis URLs and secrets.\n\nWhat you get out of the box:\n\n\\- Same visual builder: nodes, connections, real-time execution/logs\n\n\\- 30+ integrations: Google Sheets/Slack/Notion/Telegram/Gmail/GitHub/Discord/OpenAI/Twilio/etc.\n\n\\- Built-in AI agent nodes (supports OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Grok – tool use and all)\n\n\\- No white-label restrictions or forced branding – it's MIT licensed, your instance, your rules\n\n\\- Unlimited executions/workflows when self-hosted (no artificial caps)\n\nIt's not a 1:1 n8n clone—node library is smaller (growing), no ultra-deep custom code nodes yet, but for the 80% of practical flows that actually ship? This cuts the deployment pain to almost zero.\n\nI've been running it locally and on a cheap VPS—feels snappy, data stays private, and no more \"update broke my instance\" surprises.\n\nIf you're tired of heavy orchestration for simple things, give the Docker image a spin and tell me what breaks first (or what you'd want added). What's stopping you from self-hosting more automations right now—setup complexity, missing nodes, or just not worth the hassle? Genuinely want to hear.",

The setup tax is usually what kills experimentation, not the automation logic itself.\n\nWe’ve seen a similar pattern while working with visual automation tools like Origami Tech on the hosted side. Most people don’t mind limited power at first, but they bounce fast if getting to a first working flow feels like infrastructure work instead of problem-solving.\n\nThe one-command Docker approach makes a lot of sense for that 80 percent use case you mentioned. Curious how you’re thinking about the tradeoff between keeping the surface area small and letting advanced users extend things without reintroducing setup pain.",

Be clear\n\nIf your tagline doesn’t answer “what does this do, and for who?” in that half second, they scroll past.\n\nThe best-performing taglines all did one of these two things:\n\n* Outcome-first: “Turn abandoned carts into revenue for Shopify stores.” (more demos booked, fewer bugs, faster support.)\n* Audience-first: “Analytics that non-technical founders actually understand.” (SaaS founders, agencies, solopreneurs, Shopify stores, recruiters.)\n\n1. Link with an action verb\n\nTo make a proper tagline, you need a clear verb: turn, track, collect, launch, ship.\n\nIt will connect the feature to the audience, or to the outcome or the audience to the outcome, your choice.\n\nI reverse‑engineered patterns from standout vs invisible launches and [turned it into a small playbook.](https://startuphunt.io/before-you-launch)\n\nIt breaks down:\n\n* How they picked categories that actually sent traffic\n* How they timed launches across directories\n* How they wrote one‑line pitches people clicked\n* What failed launches looked like on the same sites\n\nA fun exercise to prove how good it is : Give me your current tagline (and website) and I’ll recraft your tagline",
