It got me some initial eyeballs but never converted into real traction. Maybe I was doing it wrong. Maybe I was talking to the wrong people. Not sure.\n\nNow I'm building something new. A platform where you can prompt to generate motion graphics videos. You can upload assets, drop in image references for inspiration, and it generates the video. Planning to add video to video generation later.\n\nI actually use this myself. I could never crack motion graphics with traditional tools. This finally works for me. So I know the problem is real, at least for people like me.\n\nBut here's where I'm stuck again.\n\nHow do I find the right channels this time? I don't want to just spray and pray on Twitter again. I want to be more intentional about where I show up.\n\nHow do I know when I've actually found my ICP? With my last products I thought I knew who I was building for but the people who signed up were completely different from who I expected.\n\nFor those who figured out distribution as an indie hacker, what actually worked? Not the stuff that sounds good in theory but what actually moved the needle for you?\n\nAppreciate any honest takes.",

Shipping was never my problem either, it was always getting clarity on why people didn’t convert once they landed.\n\nOne thing I learned the hard way is that distribution and ICP get a lot clearer when you watch real people use the product cold. In my case, I thought I knew who it was for, but first-time users kept getting stuck, hitting edge cases, or interpreting things differently than I expected. That mismatch killed conversion way more than channel choice.\n\nLately I’ve been doing short product vibe tests for founders to surface trust issues, UX friction, and early edge cases before trying to scale distribution. It’s helped sanity-check ICP assumptions without spray-and-pray posting.\n\nIf it’s useful, happy to take a quick look at yours. This is what I’m working on: [breakmy.app](http://breakmy.app)\n\nCurious though, who actually used your last products versus who you thought you were building for?",

You should still create lower-effort \"build in public\" posts on X so that you can engage with a couple of other builders on X, but this is not where your traffic will come from. When you're early, you should fully focus on cold outreach. Find your target audience (either X, Reddit, LinkedIn etc.) and send them cold DMs. This starts 1:1 conversations which help you build relationships, validate your message and offer, get qualitative feedback and ask for testimonials. This is how you get your first paying customers and how you get real signals that you can use to improve your product and offer, and narrow down your ICP.\n\nIf you're having trouble finding your ideal ICP, you can use Bazzly which will find and reach out to your target audience on Reddit.",

Distribution is tough because it's not just about posting updates, it's about showing up where people are already looking for solutions. For your motion graphics thing, maybe start with communities around video editing or content creation. Places like r/videography or even forums for marketers who need quick visuals. I found that joining those spots and just listening first helped me spot who was actually frustrated with tools like After Effects. Then, when I shared, it felt more like helping than selling. Also, tracking who engages with your posts can reveal your real ICP over time. Mine turned out to be way different too. Hang in there, sounds like you're onto something useful.",

Before worrying about channels, worth validating if that segment exists at all.\n\nOne thing that worked for me: instead of posting about what I'm building, I'd ask specific questions about the problem in the subreddits/discords where my target users hang out.

          "text": "Distribution, for many teams, isn't a channel problem. It's a testing volume problem. the algorithm updates constantly and if you post once a day for a few weeks you will only see minimal traction and conclude distribution is hard. But that is because people underestimate the volume required to stay relevant in 2026. most founders our team has worked with have never run enough experiments to actually learn what works for their specific product and audience.\n\nFor a motion graphics tool, TikTok, Instagram Reels, and Facebook are where I'd focus. Short before/after transformations perform extremely well for creative tools. Something like \"I can't use After Effects so I built this\" grabs attention.\n\nYour founder story is great for building connection and getting people to care about you BUT what actually drives conversions is other people showing up on camera talking about your product. Real users explaining how it solved their problem. That's what gets people to buy. (of course you love your product, youre the founder! people want to see what everyday users have to say)\n\nThink about it this way. Research shows it takes somewhere between 7 to 13 touchpoints before someone makes a purchase decision. Most people see your product once, think \"that's cool,\" and forget about it. You need to keep showing up in their feed through multiple pieces of content from multiple angles before they actually convert. Same for sales systems are founded upon this as a lead goes through the funnel. \n\nStop guessing and start tracking. When you get signups, ask two questions. What do you do? And what were you trying to solve when you found us? The patterns will emerge fast.\n\nYou said the people who signed up for your last products were different than expected. That's actually useful data. What were they? That might tell you something about where to look now.\n\n**We have worked with over 50+ brands and the only thing that will turn your socials into revenue is UGC in mass VOLUME and ITERATION**. The founders we work with see a huge increase in MRR because  our distribution isn't running 10 experiments: we're running 600-1500 experiments monthly. of course, that is alot for a founder to do but you can take the lesson:\n\nyou want to be making as much diversified content as possible: Different hooks, different formats, different creators, different audiences. You need to treat marketing as systematic testing until you find what converts, then you double down hard on the winners.\n\nThe hook piece is especially important. You can have the same product, same creator, same platform, but swap the hook and get completely different results. \"Watch me make a logo animation\" versus \"I failed at After Effects for 3 years until I tried this\" will perform totally differently even if they show the same thing.\n\nAnd when something works, don't move on. Scale it. If a certain angle or format or creator style is getting traction, run more variations of that. Most people find one thing that works and then go try something new instead of milking the winner.\n\nGet real users making content about your tool. Even just 5 or 10 people posting honest reviews about how they use it will outperform you posting founder updates every day. That social proof stacks up and hits people multiple times from different voices.\n\nWhat's your current content output look like? And who were those unexpected signups from your previous products?",

Offer: “I’ll generate your motion graphic for free if I can watch and ask 5 questions.” That’s user research + UGC + case study in one.\n\nThen run micro-experiments: 20–30 short before/after clips with 5 different hooks, not 2 “perfect” ones. Track: hook, audience, watch time, clicks, signups. Kill fast, double down on what moves signups, not views.\n\nMain point: pick a painfully specific buyer, live where they hang out, and treat content as experiments tied to one clear outcome, not random posts.\n\nOn tools: I’ve used TweetHunter and Sparktoro to find where people hang out, and Pulse for Reddit to catch real-time threads where people literally ask for motion graphics help so you can jump in with real examples instead of shouting into the void.",

What helped was tracking where my first 10-20 signups came from and what they had in common - job titles, company size, the specific pain they mentioned. Usually a pattern emerges that's different from your assumptions.\n\nFor motion graphics specifically, I'd go narrow: find communities where people actively complain about After Effects or traditional tools being overkill for what they need. Reddit niche subs, Discord servers for content creators, maybe even Loom/video tool communities. One engaged niche beats spraying across Twitter.",

Great for support and accountability, terrible for actual distribution. Your motion graphics users aren't scrolling #buildinpublic hashtags.\n\n  \nFor your specific product (motion graphics video generation), here's where I'd look:\n\n  \n\\*\\*Go where the pain is visible:\\*\\*\n\n\\- After Effects subreddits where people post \"how do I do X\" questions\n\n\\- YouTube tutorials for motion graphics - the comments are full of struggling creators\n\n\\- TikTok/Reels creators who want motion graphics but can't afford/learn professional tools\n\n\\- Discord servers for content creators, not developers\n\n  \n\\*\\*On finding ICP:\\*\\*\n\nStop trying to define your ICP before launch. Launch, see who actually converts, then talk to those specific people. The people who pay tell you who your customer is - you don't get to decide in advance.\n\n  \nThe gap between \"signed up\" and \"who I expected\" is actually useful data. Those unexpected users found something valuable enough to sign up. Figure out why.\n\n  \nDistribution for tools like this is less about \"spray and pray\" and more about showing up in one specific place, repeatedly, with genuinely helpful content. Pick the one channel where your users already complain about this problem.",

It's a content strategy.**\n\nPosting updates to your 200 followers won't move the needle. What works is strategic replies on bigger accounts in your space. Find 10-15 accounts with 20k+ followers who talk to your audience. Turn on notifications. Reply early with genuine insight. One good reply can get more eyeballs than a month of your own posts.\n\nYour posts are for credibility when people click your profile. Replies are for reach.\n\n**2. You find your ICP through conversations, not assumptions.**\n\nYou said the people who signed up were different from who you expected. That's actually useful data. Go talk to them. Ask why they signed up, what problem they were trying to solve, where they hang out online.\n\nYour ICP isn't who you imagine. It's who actually shows up. Then you go find more of those people.\n\nFor motion graphics, I'd start by asking: who makes motion graphics today and hates it? Marketers? YouTubers? Agencies? Find where they complain about their current tools and show up there with value first, pitch later.",

Then found 10 more like them. That told me where to show up.  \n  \nThe sign you found your ICP isn't that they sign up. It's that they tell you what's broken without you asking. If people sign up but stay silent, you haven't found your ICP yet. You've found people who are curious but not desperate.  \n  \nI started searching Reddit for people complaining about the exact problem my tool solved, then DMed them (not pitching, just \"hey building this, curious about your workflow\"). 60% responded, 40% asked for early access without me mentioning it.  \n  \nFor your motion graphics tool - search for \"motion graphics too hard\" or \"can't afford motion designer for my demo.\" That's your ICP screaming for a solution.  \n  \nThe people who signed up for your last products - did they tell you what they were trying to accomplish?

The \"free work\" offers are usually win-win when approached correctly - the person offering gets portfolio pieces and real-world experience, the person receiving gets free help with something they'd otherwise pay for or skip entirely.\n\nThe catch most people miss: you get what you scope. If you approach these with \"can you review my landing page,\" you'll get surface-level feedback. If you approach with \"here's my landing page, my target customer is X, my main CTA is Y, I'm seeing Z% bounce rate - what's not working?\" you'll get actionable insights.\n\nThe other pattern I've noticed: the people offering free work often become paid service providers later. If someone does a great job on a free automation for you, they're now a known quantity when you need paid work done. Relationship building works both ways.\n\nOne thing to watch out for - some of these offers are lead gen funnels disguised as free help. Nothing wrong with that, but worth knowing going in.",

Probably worthless. Most will bounce.\n\n40k verified emails of startup founders from the last 6 months who opted in? That's gold if you're selling to founders.\n\nAlso be careful with how you use them. Sending cold emails to scraped lists can get you blacklisted fast. Most email providers will shut you down if your bounce rate or spam complaints are too high.\n\nWhat are you planning to do with them?",

I scrap daily 400+ startup data on [startuphunt.io](http://startuphunt.io) for my newsletter.\n\nEach idea follows that exact structure so you get distribution, clarity, and a built-in positioning story from day one.\n\n(app ideas purely invented feel free to copy that, if they do ... my bad).\n\n* **Email | Marketing | SaaS:** A B2B tool that scores every email campaign by revenue generated per segment and recommends the next campaign to send.\n* **Analytics | SaaS | Tech:** A unified dashboard that connects to your SaaS stack (billing, product, CRM) and highlights which features and cohorts drive MRR and retention.\n* **Marketing | SEO | Search:** A planner that clusters keywords by user intent and suggests landing page structures and internal links to own each cluster.\n* **Chrome Extensions | Design Tools | Developer Tools:** A browser extension that lets you point‑and‑click live UIs, extract styles/components, and export them into your design system.\n* **Social Media | Marketing | Growth Hacking:** A tool that turns each post into a mini funnel (hook, lead magnet, DM script) and auto‑tests variants to grow followers and leads.\n* **Design Tools | User Experience | Icons:** An icon system that adapts automatically to your product’s tone (playful, serious, fintech, health) and exports ready‑to‑ship sets.\n* **Productivity | Meetings | Calendar:** A calendar companion that scores every meeting on cost vs outcome, auto‑suggests cancellations, and enforces agendas and time boxes.\n* **Health & Fitness | Artificial Intelligence | Fitness:** A training app that adjusts workouts in real time based on past sessions, sleep, and soreness instead of a static program.\n* **Productivity | Writing | Notes:** A notes app that turns raw notes into clean outlines, tweets, and blog post drafts grouped by topic.\n* **iOS | Health & Fitness | Productivity:** An iOS app that embeds 10‑second wellness actions into existing routines like unlocking your phone or opening certain apps.\n* **SaaS | Artificial Intelligence | No-Code:** A no‑code builder where ops teams design workflows and an AI layer generates the logic, integrations, and error handling.\n* **Fintech | Investing | Artificial Intelligence:** An investing copilot that summarizes portfolio risk, proposes small weekly rebalances, and blocks emotional trades with behavioral nudges.\n* **Productivity | Task Management | Calendar:** A planner where you define time budgets for goals (build, sell, learn) and the calendar dynamically enforces those allocations.\n* **Chrome Extensions | Productivity | Notion:** A browser extension that saves pages, highlights, and screenshots directly into structured Notion databases with tags and relations.\n* **Web App | Productivity | Artificial Intelligence:** A browser‑based workspace that pulls tasks from multiple tools and uses an assistant to propose the single next best task per focus block.\n* **Mac | Productivity | Artificial Intelligence:** A Mac menu bar assistant that watches window/app usage and suggests automations (shortcuts, scripts, focus modes) proactively.\n* **API | Payments | Developer Tools:** A unified payments API that normalizes Stripe, Paddle, PayPal, and app stores so developers query “MRR, churn, LTV” with one schema.\n* **Privacy | Developer Tools | Security:** A dev tool that scans code, logs, and configs in CI/CD to prevent secret leakage and enforce privacy/security policies automatically.\n* **Android | iOS | Productivity:** A mobile hub that aggregates metrics (revenue, analytics, socials) and lets founders trigger key actions like refunds, replies, and deploys from one place.\n* **Chrome Extensions | Productivity | Social Media:** A browser extension to draft, schedule, and repurpose threads across multiple networks from any tab, with performance stats inline.\n\nOpen for criticism on my technique or any questions!",

Wise transfers. No invoices. No trace.\n\nI stopped there.\n\nI decided to fight with bare hands.\n\nI kept replying on Reddit, Discord, and X.  \nI even used KironX itself to reply to live posts and say I was launching.\n\nThat part actually worked.\n\n# Real results (no hype)\n\n* Finished 35th\n* 11 installs\n* New users completed onboarding\n* Real feedback\n* A new Chrome Store review\n* \\~9 visitors came directly from Product Hunt\n\nMost DMs were either:\n\n* vote sellers\n* “security disclosures”\n\nMy real distribution still comes from X, Google, CSS Winner, and TechTrendin.\n\n  \n**What I learned**\n\nThe market is saturated. What worked 1–2 years ago doesn’t work the same today.\n\n*Mass distribution is overcrowded.*\n\nWhat *does* work:\n\n* smaller, trusted communities\n* being where your users already are\n* earning trust over time\n\nUsers who try KironX like it.  \nIt works. It helps. It doesn’t disappoint.\n\nNow the mission is clear:  \n**find the nest where your users already live.**\n\nFor KironX, that place is X itself.\n\n# Open question\n\nI’d genuinely love to hear from founders who launched on Product Hunt this year. Tell me,  \nHow did it go for you?\n\nI finished **35th**, which honestly isn’t bad given my distribution.  \nFor those planning to launch soon, these were my signals and my reality.\n\n[9 visitors from PH](https://preview.redd.it/wn8k0se9s2gg1.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=00c95df8140978230e21910e45e757c7e1a2ae30)\n\n",

      "text": "I see a lot of people struggling with moving past the $100 MRR milestone, so I’m sharing the exact sequence I used to go from $0 to $600 without an audience or paid ads.\n\n**1) Getting the first customers**\n\nI didn’t create content or try to build an audience first. This is too slow. I didn’t even launch on Product Hunt (in fact I still haven’t launched there). Instead, I reached out directly to people who were clearly my target audience and offered them to try out my tool for free.\n\nThose conversations did two things at once:\n\n* I got people to try out my tool even tho I didn’t have any social proof\n* I got to understand exactly what kind of solution are they looking for\n\nOnce their free trial would end, I’d see if they convert. If not, I’d reach out again and ask why. All this feedback made me understand in which direction to take the product, how to position, and how to price. Whenever I’d get an insight, I’d implement it, and continue with reaching out to people. And eventually, I got my first couple of paying customers.\n\n**2) Getting to $100 MRR**\n\nThe approach above is how I got to $100 MRR and my first testimonials I could put on my landing page. But once I hit the $100 mark, I noticed something important: users were churning.\n\nSo instead of doing more outreach, I paused and switched focus to talking to people who canceled to understand why. Based on what they’d tell me, I’d implement changes, then go back to doing outreach to see if those changes actually made a difference. This loop of feedback + reiteration lasted 3 months.\n\nBy the end of it, I had:\n\n* better offer\n* better landing page\n* better activation\n* higher signups\n* lower churn\n\nAt this point, my funnel finally felt healthy, so it made sense to go all-in on marketing again.\n\n**3) Growing to $600 MRR**\n\nOnce the funnel felt healthy and users were actually sticking around, I went back to doing cold outreach and that alone got me to around $200 MRR.\n\nAt this point, I had a solid product, a working outreach system and had learned valuable strategies and insights I could share with my target audience. That’s when creating content started to make sense.\n\nI took real lessons and wins and started sharing them on X and Reddit. Since these lessons were based on my real experience, they were actually valuable and resonated with my audience. Those posts brought in more traffic and customers, which would give me new lessons and insights, which I could use to create new content. And this loop helped add $100 MRR every week.\n\nSo long story short, keep talking to your ideal customers, keep iterating on your offer, and keep repeating this until things click. Once they do, that’s when you start stacking other marketing channels.\n\nIf you want to see proof and the actual timeline of my growth, you can [see it here.](https://trustmrr.com/startup/bazzly)\n\nHappy to answer any questions or go deeper so you can apply this to your SaaS!",

Most people try to do content first because it feels safer than cold outreach, but you end up writing content without understanding what actually resonates because you haven't talked to enough customers yet.\n\n  \nOne thing i'd add: the transition from outreach to content works because you've earned the insights. When you share \"lessons learned\" without the learning, it reads like generic advice. When you share lessons that cost you 3 months of churn conversations, people can tell the difference.\n\n  \nSolid playbook.",

The \"pause marketing to fix churn\" phase is the part most founders skip, and it's the reason they stay stuck at $100.\n\n  \nOne thing I'd add: the type of outreach matters. I've found that replying to people actively complaining about a problem (on Twitter, Reddit, forums) converts 5-10x better than cold DMs to people who fit a demographic. They've already admitted they have the pain.\n\n  \nThe content flywheel you described is real. Once you have actual wins to share, the content writes itself. Before that, most \"build in public\" content is just noise.\n\n  \nQuestion: when you were doing the initial outreach, how did you find the people to reach out to? Manual search or any tools/filters?",

Did they act on it? That feedback loop was way reminded faster than analytics dashboards.\n\nAnd with Suippy (still validating), I’m deliberately staying in that “talk to people + watch intent” phase. I’m less interested in whether someone likes the idea and more in whether they try to sell something, set a price, or share a link.\n\nTotally agree that once the funnel feels healthy, content and broader distribution finally make sense.

      "text": "Here's something that's been bothering me.\n\nWhen big tech teams launch a new feature (even a small one), they spend at least a week in strategy sessions. Multiple people. War rooms. Whiteboards. Proven frameworks like SWOT analysis, Six Thinking Hats, assumption reversal. They stress-test every angle before writing a single line of code.\n\nThat's 40 hours minimum. Multiply that by 6-8 people on the team, and you're looking at 240-320 person-hours of structured thinking before execution begins.\n\nNow here's what a solo founder does (and yes, I'm guilty of this):\n\nWe get an idea. We think about it in the shower. Maybe we write down a few notes. Then we open ChatGPT: \"Is this a good idea?\" ChatGPT: \"Yes! Great market opportunity!\"\n\nTotal time invested: 30 minutes.\n\nThen we start coding. Because that feels productive. Planning feels like procrastination.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tlskaq2jkagg1.png?width=2752&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f564ccb029592939f142b422d1cb4b652ab7c06\n\n**Here's the backwards part:**\n\nBig tech can afford to fail. If a project flops, they write it off as R&D. Their risk tolerance is infinite.\n\nSolo founders cannot afford to fail. If you spend 4 months building the wrong thing, that's 4 months of savings, energy, and opportunity cost you'll never get back.\n\nYet big tech teams spend 40 hours planning. We spend 30 minutes.\n\n**The pattern I keep seeing:**\n\nBig tech borrowed startup execution speed (\"move fast and break things\"). But they kept their planning rigor.\n\nSolo founders copied the execution speed (\"just ship it\"). But we skipped the planning rigor.\n\nWe took the wrong lesson.\n\nWhen someone at a big tech company says \"just ship it,\" they're saying it AFTER a week of brainstorming with a cross-functional team. When a solo founder says \"just ship it,\" they're saying it after a shower thought and a ChatGPT chat.\n\n**\"But shouldn't I just talk to customers instead of planning?\"**\n\nYes. You absolutely should talk to customers. But here's the thing: you should do the hard thinking BEFORE those conversations, not after.\n\nIf you go into customer interviews without a clear hypothesis, without having challenged your own assumptions, you'll waste those early conversations. You won't know what questions to ask. You won't recognize when someone is being polite versus genuinely interested. And if you seem uncertain or confused about your own idea, they won't take you seriously enough to give you real feedback.\n\nThose first 10-20 potential customers are precious. They're your most valuable data source. Don't burn them by showing up unprepared.\n\nStructured thinking makes customer conversations 10x more valuable. It doesn't replace them.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\nI'm not saying you need to spend a week planning. You don't have a team of 8. You don't have infinite runway.\n\nBut you need more than 30 minutes.\n\nYou need to borrow their frameworks, not their budgets. You need to simulate the pushback a team would give you. You need to challenge your own assumptions before the market does.\n\nBecause the irony is brutal: Those who can afford to fail plan the most. Those who can't afford to fail don't plan at all.\n\n**What I do now:**\n\nI force myself to spend 2-3 days on structured brainstorming before writing code. I use the same frameworks big tech uses (Six Thinking Hats, SCAMPER, assumption reversal..).\n\nIt feels slow. It feels unproductive. But it's the only effective way I've found to avoid wasting months on the wrong thing.",

It still takes time to develop an MVP. If you blow two weeks building and learn it's the wrong thing, that's still slower than one week of research and planning.\n2. Whatever you decide to \"just ship\" will have a ton of assumptions built-in, and customer feedback won't necessarily help you. For example, if you build a mobile app, but your ICP really would have preferred a white-glove service, it's almost impossible to get that feedback once your mobile app has users, because they think of your product as an app.\n3. It assumes you have or can easily get customers. If you just ship and it's crickets, it's hard to figure out what you did wrong. But it's avoidable. Research and planning are the key.\n4. Brand takes years to build, but it can be destroyed in days. If you ship something that breaks or pisses off customers, word will spread. You may not care, and if the product is young enough you can even quickly rebrand. But I do think there are real long-term consequences to shipping a half-baked product.\n\nThe middle ground between \"corporate\" and \"YOLO\" is actually pretty doable. If you talk to exactly five potential users or current customers, you're getting 90% of the value of a full research project. You don't even really need frameworks to move forward from research; you will naturally identify themes, and if you discuss the feedback for a day or two, you will pull out some insights. From there you can brainstorm based on the research, and either do a second round of interviews to refine the concept, or just go ahead with one. Either way, you've significantly improved your starting point.\n\nEven in the age of vibe coding it still takes time to bang out a product, so it's a good investment.",

Here's my current process:\nI split planning into two phases: brainstorming and synthesis.\n\nPhase 1: Structured brainstorming (Day 1-2)\nI use proven frameworks to look at the idea from multiple angles. Not random thinking, but systematic:\nSix Thinking Hats: I force myself to wear each hat separately. White Hat (just the facts), Red Hat (gut feeling), Yellow Hat (why it could work), Black Hat (why it will fail), Green Hat (alternatives), Blue Hat (process check). The Black Hat is where most people skip, but it's the most valuable.\nSCAMPER: I run the idea through modification prompts. Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse. This surfaces variations I'd never think of otherwise.\nAssumption Reversal: I list every assumption the idea depends on, then flip each one backwards and defend the opposite. Half my assumptions collapse under this test.\nAs I go through these, I take structured notes. Not scattered thoughts, but organized by framework. I'm building a living document that captures the thinking process.\n\nPhase 2: Synthesis (Day 2-3)\nI take all those insights and compile them into a project brief. This has:\nProblem statement (validated, not assumed)\nProposed solution (with alternatives considered)\nTarget users (specific, not vague)\nRisks and fatal flaws (identified upfront)\nUnit economics (rough, but realistic)\nSuccess metrics (defined before building)\nThe brief becomes my source of truth. When I use Cursor or Claude or any AI tool, I paste this brief in first. It gives them context so they stop hallucinating generic solutions.\nTotal time: 4 to 6 hours spread over 2 to 3 days. Not continuous. I do a session, sleep on it, come back fresh.\nThe hard part is forcing yourself through the Black Hat when you're excited. But that's the whole point. Challenge assumptions BEFORE you're emotionally invested.\n\nDoes this help? Happy to go deeper on any specific framework.",
