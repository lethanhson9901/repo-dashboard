I’ve had the privilege of helping him shape it using my psychology expertise, testing it firsthand, and helping ensure it’s safe, user-led, and trauma-informed.\n\n\nPrivacy is built-in: nothing you share is sold or exposed, and even Adonis does not see your data.\n\n\nHe is adding a gentle, optional user assessment. It’s not a test, it’s not diagnostic, it simply helps Haven adapt to the user’s needs while fully respecting boundaries.\n\n\nYou can find Haven by searching for “Haven by Prometheus Systems” in your browser. For now, it works best on a Windows laptop or desktop, but an app is coming soon!\n\n\nHaven is always evolving. Any feedback you share would mean the world to Adonis, and me. Thank you for helping us make Haven even better.\n\n\n— Logan",

Massive system prompts don't scale when you have 50 different templates.\n\nThe solution I built is a SaaS that treats Markdown as the source of truth for agentic logic. Instead of a 2,000-word prompt, domain experts (lawyers, engineers, auditors) define the \"workflow\" in Markdown. The agent then runs this server-side via RPC, using the Markdown structure to maintain state and conduct a guided dialogue with the user.",

It doesn't mean it's bad. It means you haven't tested it against reality yet, and more building won't change that.\n\nThe \"should I give up\" question gets a lot easier when you reframe it as \"do I have any external evidence that this matters to anyone other than me.\"",

Here is what worked for me.\n\n  \nFor the ones I sold, I listed them on SideProjectors and got a buyer within a couple weeks for both. The key was being transparent about what the project actually had (some SEO juice, a working codebase, a decent domain) vs what it needed (marketing, time, maybe a pivot). Buyers appreciated honesty over hype.\n\n  \nOther places worth checking: [Acquire.com](http://Acquire.com) if the project has any revenue at all, even small. 1KProjects for stuff under $1k. Flippa works but its noisy, you will get a lot of tire kickers. Indiemaker is newer but specifically built for this.\n\n  \nFor the projects I let die, my biggest regret is not open sourcing them. If you cant sell it, throwing it on GitHub with a good README at least gives it a second life and sometimes drives traffic back to your other stuff.\n\n  \nOne thing I learned the hard way: the longer you wait, the less a project is worth. Domains expire, dependencies get outdated, whatever small SEO you had decays. If you know you are not coming back to it, list it now even if the price is embarrassingly low. Someone paying $200 for your abandoned project is better than it sitting there costing you renewal fees.",

Flippa was a waste of time, just lowballers and tire kickers. The thing that actually worked best was posting in niche communities related to the projects problem space, not as a sales pitch but more like \"hey i built this thing and dont have time for it, anyone want it?\" Got way more genuine interest that way than any marketplace.",

          "text": "I keep most of mine running if the hosting cost is negligible. Hetzner servers are cheap enough that a few abandoned projects sitting idle don't matter. That's one of the main reasons I switched to Hetzner + Kamal 2 for my projects — the cost of running multiple projects and keeping them running on PaaS like Render is too high.\n\nThe ones I actually value get cannibalised for parts — auth flows, email templates, API patterns. A dead project with a working Stripe integration saves me a day on the next one.\n\nFor selling, I've never had luck with no-revenue projects. The buyer knows you couldn't make it work and prices accordingly. Open sourcing tends to generate more value (traffic, goodwill, potential contributors) than the $50 Flippa offers.",

At first I was affraid of telling people so no one would steal my idea! After telling few friends, they made me realise I had something great. I then tried pushing it further and got 2 devs to join and help me, but this project was so massive and time consuming for us all we abandonned it about 2 years ago. Last november tho, I saw a tik tok video about what AI could now do with developping website... oh well, that awakened a kraken in me!! hahahahaha  \nSince november I have spent close to 300 hours on my project, all by myself and massive AI help!! I invested few thousands into hardware and AI production tools, mostly Claude AI and I have built from scratch my whole idea! This whole thing is getting crazy and NOW for once in my life I feel like I am going somewhere with this!  \nAfter doubts, fears and lack of knowledge I decided to surpasse them and go all in no matter what! And there it is, the website is 100% fonctionnal and online. more than 100 pages, live video feeds, live chats, internal messaging system, AI monitoring and content generating, fully scalable for a worldwide launch. Did it all myself, just because I decided to try and see. Oh, did I mention, i'm a accounting technician lolll but had an idea and figured out how to do it with Claude AI helping me every step of the way to build [elbo.world](http://elbo.world) which I trully believe might one day become more than a simple side project for me. :)",

Lead with that.\nSomething like “I built a dashboard that tells indie devs which of their side projects are actually making money and which ones they should kill.” Way punchier.\n\nFor finding customers, you’re literally in the right place. r/indiehackers, r/SideProject, r/microsaas are full of people juggling multiple projects who have no idea which one is worth their time. That’s your exact customer.\n\nHave you tried just answering questions in those subs about project management or revenue tracking? Don’t pitch, just help.

You can find people actively describing problems in real time and jump into conversations. The downside is you cant really build a following here, every post starts from zero. But the quality of feedback you get is way higher because people on Reddit will tell you what they actually think.\n\n  \nX is better for compounding over time. Your posts build on each other, followers accumulate, and eventually your reach grows without extra effort. But it takes months of consistent posting before it clicks. And yeah the content quality in most niches has tanked.\n\n  \nWhat worked for me: start on Reddit to find your first 10-20 users and validate that people actually want what you are building. Not by posting \"check out my thing\" but by genuinely helping people who have the problem you solve. Once you have real users and real feedback, switch to X and share what you are learning. Actual lessons from building and talking to customers perform 10x better than generic advice threads.\n\n  \nThe mistake most people make is treating both platforms like billboards. Neither works if you are just broadcasting. Reddit rewards being useful in conversations. X rewards being interesting over time.\n\n  \nAlso worth considering where your specific audience hangs out. If you are B2B, LinkedIn might actually beat both. If you are targeting developers, Hacker News and specific subreddits will outperform X easily.",

Search for people already complaining about the problem you solve. Their thread, their words. Helping in those comments converts way better than any content post.\n- X compounds, but slowly. It only starts working after months of consistency, and even then only if you have real stories to share. Early on it’s basically shouting into a void.\n- Reddit’s brutal honesty is the feature. Yeah it’s hard to build a following here, but the feedback is real. People will tell you your idea sucks to your face, and that’s worth more than 50 polite likes on X.\n\nIf you hate X’s vibe (I do too), skip it for now. Focus on being useful in 2-3 subreddits where your people hang out. You’ll learn more about your customers in a week of that than a month of posting content on either platform.",

Affiliate model with translation services - there is huge intent behind Spanglish searches, people actually want to communicate across languages\n\n2. Ad revenue on the translation queries - this is high-volume, low-intent traffic which works well for display ads\n\n3. Language learning angle - Spanglish users are often people trying to improve their English or Spanish, could upsell courses\n\nThe smart move might be validating one monetization angle quickly before handing it off. Set up Google AdSense for a week, see what CPM you get. Run one affiliate link test. That data makes the asset way more valuable to a buyer.\n\nWhat kind of traffic are you seeing right now even without any SEO work?\n\n",

A few weeks ago, I made \"[Honest PMM](https://thehonestpmm.com),\" a satirical landing page mocking SaaS tropes, specifically to drive traffic to Oden.\n\nIt was a marketing experiment. That's it.\n\nDid it work?\n\nKind of. The satirical page got way more attention than my actual product:\n\n\\- 756 users, 4K events on Honest PMM\n\n\\- Peaked around Jan 25 with \\~600 users in a day\n\n\\- Decent engagement, people actually played around with it\n\n\\- Traffic to Oden from it? Modest. Signups? 2\n\nSo the experiment was fun, got some laughs, sparked a few good DMs from PMMs venting about their actual problems. But it didn't convert the way I hoped.\n\nThe mistake I made:\n\nI should have launched Oden on Product Hunt when Honest PMM was peaking. I didn't. I was still tweaking things. Now the traffic is basically gone and I'm launching anyway.\n\nBut I am doing that now, Tell me how you would have capitalised the momentum?\n\nWould love of you could support the [PH launch](https://www.producthunt.com/products/oden?launch=oden)",

That audience mismatch is the core issue, not just timing.\n\n  \nWhat I would have done differently:\n\n  \n1) Put a sticky banner on Honest PMM that says something like \"This is satire. The real tool that does this properly is Oden\" with a one-click demo. You had 756 people on the page and almost no bridge between the joke and the product.\n\n  \n2) Captured emails on the satire page itself. Even a simple \"Want more PMM roasts? Drop your email\" would have given you a list to nurture. Those 756 users are gone forever now.\n\n  \n3) The PH launch timing you mentioned is correct but I would have gone further. Cross-post the satire to Twitter and LinkedIn tagging product marketing people, then launch Oden on PH the next day while the conversation is still warm. You want people seeing the joke and the real product within the same 48 hour window.\n\n  \n4) Turn the satirical content into a series. One viral page is a spike. A weekly roast of SaaS landing page tropes builds an audience that eventually becomes your funnel.\n\n  \nThe good news is the experiment proved something valuable: you can create content that gets attention. Most people cant do that at all. The missing piece is just the conversion infrastructure between the attention and the product.",

Every joke should have led into a sharp “this is the real pain, here’s how Oden fixes it” moment: a short story, 1–2 killer screenshots, then a dead simple CTA (“Get a teardown of your competitor’s launch in 24h” instead of generic signup).\n\nNext time I’d line up a mini launch stack before flipping the switch: Product Hunt, a pinned X/LinkedIn thread breaking down the joke + real lessons, and 3–5 PMM communities where you share the satire first, then follow up with “here’s the tool I actually built to fix this.” Tools like SparkToro and Clay are solid for finding PMMs by company/role, and Pulse for Reddit is handy for catching threads where marketers are already ranting about bad SaaS positioning so you can drop both the satire and Oden at the right moment.\n\nMain point: design the joke as a guided path into one painfully specific use case, not a general brand billboard.",

Especially if the numbers move.\n\nWhat has worked well in usage SaaS: \n\n* Show clear usage metrics in the API and dashboard\n* Show effective blended rate on the invoice\n* Lock pricing tiers contractually for a period\n* Keep geo level cost mechanics internal\n\nTransparency builds trust when it helps customers forecast. It hurts when it creates volatility they can’t control.\n\nIf a single user is asking, that’s usually a signal they’re cost sensitive or building internal chargebacks. I’d ask what problem they’re trying to solve before committing to exposing raw unit fees.",

      "text": "I run TubeScout, a solo project that sends daily email digests with summaries of new YouTube videos from channels you follow. You pick the channels, and every morning you get an email with the key takeaways so you don't have to watch everything.\n\nRight now I have about 40 users total. 6 of them are paying founding members at $3/mo ($18 MRR). The rest are on a free tier that gives them 3 channels and 30 summaries per day.\n\nHere's what I'm planning to do and I'd love a gut check, especially on the pricing and whether the free trial will eat my margins.\n\n**The change:**\n\nI want to move from \"free forever + one paid tier\" to a 3-tier system with a 7-day free trial:\n\n* Basic: $3/mo (20 channels, 3 summaries/day)\n* Pro: $7/mo (60 channels, 20 summaries/day)\n* Premium: $12/mo (150 channels, 40 summaries/day)\n\nNew users get a 7-day trial with Pro-level access (60 channels, 20 summaries). After that they either subscribe or lose access to summaries (their channel selections stay saved).\n\nExisting free users get 1 week notice, then they're moved to the expired state too. Founding members ($3/mo) stay grandfathered.\n\n**The cost situation:**\n\nEach summary costs me about $0.006-0.007 in Gemini API fees. So the per-user monthly cost at full daily usage:\n\n* Basic (3 summaries/day x 30 days): \\~$0.63/mo. Margin: 79%\n* Pro (20/day): \\~$4.20/mo. Margin: 40%\n* Premium (40/day): \\~$8.40/mo. Margin: 30%\n\nThose margins assume every user maxes out their quota every single day, which won't happen in practice. But Premium at 30% margin feels tight.\n\n**What I'm worried about:**\n\n1. **Trial abuse eating margin.** Every new signup gets 7 days of Pro-level access for free. If people sign up, use it for a week, then bounce, I'm paying for their summaries and getting nothing. Is a 7-day trial too generous for a $3-12/mo product?\n2. **Are the limits right?** 3 summaries/day on Basic feels low but the price is also low ($3). 20 on Pro feels solid. 40 on Premium... is anyone actually going to need 150 channels and 40 summaries per day?\n3. **Killing the free tier.** Right now free users get 3 channels with full summaries. After the switch, there's no free option at all (just the 7-day trial). Part of me thinks free users are a waste since they cost money and rarely convert. But another part thinks removing free entirely might hurt discoverability and word of mouth.\n\nFor context, my founding members have been paying $3/mo for what's essentially the current Pro tier (100 channels, 30 summaries). So the new Basic tier at $3/mo is actually less than what founders get, which makes me think $3 is fair for the entry point.\n\nHas anyone here gone through a similar pricing change? Especially curious about:\n\n* Is 7-day trial the right length for this type of product?\n* Should I keep a limited free tier instead of killing it entirely?\n* Do the margins look healthy enough or am I underpricing?\n\nThanks for reading this far. Happy to answer any questions about the setup.",

Your real risk right now is obscurity, not margin erosion from free riders.\n\n  \nThat said, a few things jumped out:\n\n  \nYour Premium tier is underpriced. 30% margin at full usage is basically break-even once you factor in infrastructure, support time, and any API price changes. Either bump it to $15-18/mo or lower the limits. You want at least 50% margin on your most expensive tier because your heaviest users are also the ones who email you the most.\n\n  \n7 days is the right trial length for a daily habit product. Your value compounds over time (the more channels someone adds, the stickier it gets). 7 days gives them enough mornings to build the routine. Shorter trials work for tools you use once and decide, but yours needs repeated use to click.\n\n  \nKilling the free tier is fine at your scale. With 34 free users who havent converted after however long theyve been on, the odds they ever will are close to zero. The one thing I would keep is a degraded free experience after the trial ends, something like letting them see channel names and titles but not summaries. That way they still get the reminder of what they are missing every day without costing you API calls.\n\n  \nOne thing to watch: dont grandfather your founding members forever. $3/mo for what is now Pro-level access will feel increasingly wrong as you grow. Give them a generous runway (6 months, a year) then migrate them to whatever tier matches their usage at a discount. They will understand.",

There’s no real push to upgrade. You end up supporting a lot of free users without clear upside.\n\nI’ve personally found that a time-limited trial tends to work better, especially if users get real access to the core value. It creates urgency, and more importantly, it forces them to actually try the product properly. Whether it’s 7 days or 14 days really depends on how long it takes someone to hit that “aha” moment. For some tools, 7 days feels rushed. If your product needs usage time to show value, 14 days might convert better from a pure probability standpoint.\n\nSo I don’t think it’s about free vs no free. It’s about design. Free only works if it’s structured to lead people toward becoming paying customers. Otherwise it just becomes a parking lot for non-paying users.",

On your positioning question, what would make me pay is a tool that does ONE thing exceptionally well: localized screenshots at scale.\n\nMost indie devs have 2-10 apps across different markets. Manually adapting screenshots for German, Japanese, Korean etc is painful.\n\nThe macOS desktop angle is actually a differentiator. Most ASO tools are web-based which feels overkill. A lightweight app that lives in your menu bar fits the indie mindset.\n\nPricing: $49/year for unlimited projects. That is low enough to feel like a no-brainer but still meaningful. Position it as the tool you install on day one of app development.",

I think I tried to explain Asogenie too broadly instead of leaning hard into localized screenshots at scale.and you’re right — most indie devs don’t need a full ASO suite. They need something that removes the painful part: adapting visual assets per market.the macOS angle is intentional. I didn’t want another heavy web dashboard. Something lightweight, native, and always available felt more aligned with how indie builders actually work.\n\nThe $49/year positioning as a “day one install” tool is interesting — that framing might be stronger than marketing it as a generic AI utility.\n\nReally appreciate the thoughtful breakdown. This gives me a lot to refine. 🙏",

      "text": "Alright, here is a quick tutorial on how to be better with AI as I see some comments made here and people take all this effort to set up the bot and then just f off into the distance.\n\nWe run a social media API. No account limits. Which means I see an absurd amount of content go through our system.\n\nSome of it is bad. Like objectively bad. I’ll chalk some of that up to cultural differences and move on. Some of it is actually decent. Sometimes even looks human.\n\nI talk to our clients a lot because thats how you build partnerships and just asked around what they are doing and how. They understand that If I were to steal their busisnes I woudl did that already.\n\nRoughly:\n\n* \\~25% of the good stuff is written by actual humans\n* the rest is AI, but conditioned on the user\n* about half uses custom-trained models\n* the other half is just GPT behind a decent wrapper\n\nThe common thing for the GPT wrappers is that they all pass a brand voice file  at the start of each session.\n\nNot a “tone: friendly” prompt.  \nAn actual config that tells the model how the brand talks, what it avoids, how it structures things, what words are banned, etc.\n\nI asked a few clients how they do it, merged a couple of their setups, and cleaned it up so it’s reusable. You can pick what you want and delete the rest.\n\nHow to use it?  \nI’m not your mom. Play with it.\n\nIf you’re an agency, the obvious move is:  \ntalk to the client, steal their stories, weird phrases, strong opinions, dump that into the XML. Output improves immediately.\n\nThere’s a smaller version below.  \nFull version is on the blog. No signup, no paywall, just copy-paste.\n\nLink:  \n[https://info.bundle.social/blog/how-to-create-ai-brand-voice-xml](https://info.bundle.social/blog/how-to-create-ai-brand-voice-xml)\n\nIf you want to give something back, click around the blog and read something.

The fix that actually works is validation at generation time... run each output through a lightweight check against your banned list and structure rules before it hits the user, then re-generate on failure.

Most “AI slop” starts with vague prompts, not bad models.\n\n\n\nWhat worked for me was treating voice as a real spec:\n\n\\- worldview/opinions (what this brand strongly believes)\n\n\\- language fingerprints (favorite phrases, banned words, punctuation habits)\n\n\\- structure rules (how hooks/openings/CTAs are typically written)\n\n\\- anti-patterns (what this brand never sounds like)\n\n\n\nI’m building a tool for X creators, and once we forced this step before generation, output quality improved immediately and edit time dropped a lot. Custom models help, but a solid voice file + tight constraints gets most ROI energy wise.\n\nIt actually also has a free trial for everyone to try and checkout if you think it actually sounds like you or just another AI slop.

You can write 50 rules and the model will still drift, but give it 3-4 real samples of how you actually write and it picks up on rhythm and word choice way better than any rule can describe.\n\n  \nOne thing I'd add to this template though — negative examples specific to YOUR brand, not just generic AI slop. Like \"here's a draft I rejected and why\" next to the good ones. That contrast teaches the model more than banned words alone. Banned words catch the obvious tells but they won't fix the deeper problem of everything sounding like it came from the same slightly-too-polished voice.\n\n  \nAlso +1 to what pbalIII said about drift. Even with a perfect config, by message 4 or 5 the model starts echoing itself. We ended up just re-injecting the voice file every few messages instead of trusting the context window to hold it.",

When you write out explicit rules about what your brand sounds like, it becomes clear where your actual content drifts from your ideal voice.\n\n  \nA practical approach I've used - take your best performing posts or emails, paste them into Claude with a prompt like 'extract the patterns that make this sound like our brand' and let it identify the common threads. Then formalize those into the config.\n\n  \nThe banned words list is underrated. Removing 'delve' and 'tapestry' alone makes such a difference. Have you experimented with industry-specific banned words? For developer tools, banning phrases like 'revolutionary' or 'disrupt' has been more impactful than I expected.\n\n",

Takes seconds to test.\n\nWhat usually stops you from self-hosting workflow tools? The dependency pile-up, security worries, missing nodes, or just the time sink? Real answers appreciated – this is built to cut exactly those barriers. 🚀",

If you’re technical, ship a free tool\n\nTechnical founders overthink marketing, build more… ship small tools fast.\n\nThese tools give real value, build your email list, and justify relaunching when you improve them.\n\n1. Win the first two hours\n\nThe first hours decide if you hit the homepage or sink to “show more.”\n\nYou can’t improvise this; you need a list before launch day:\n\n* Friends and existing users who know you’re launching and exactly when\n* A short, direct message ready: “We’re live, here’s the link, a comment would help a ton”\n\nThe goal isn’t fake hype. It’s a visible, real spike early so Product Hunt’s algorithm takes you seriously.\n\nThank you for reading !",

      "text": "For months I was chasing the dream: private, unlimited automations for my side projects – no monthly fees, no data leaving my server, full control over AI agents and flows. But every time I tried self-hosting something like n8n or similar, it turned into this soul-crushing ritual.\n\nSpin up Postgres.  \n\nConfigure Redis.  \n\nFight compose files that break on restart.  \n\nSpend a whole evening just to get the UI loading.  \n\nThen one update later, something silently dies and I’m back debugging at 2 AM.\n\nI kept thinking: **This should not be this hard for the 80% of stuff I actually need – daily Sheet pulls, Slack notifications, AI content queues, lead bots.** The friction was higher than the value, so most ideas stayed in **someday** tabs forever.\n\nAfter too many failed attempts, I decided to strip it down. I took the same engine I use for a2n.io (the hosted version) and packaged it into a single, pre-built Docker image that embeds everything – Postgres, Redis, the React frontend, NestJS backend – no extras required for quick runs.\n\nRepo with all the details: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nThe deploy step that changed everything for me:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nThat's it. Docker pulls the image, starts the container, maps the port, creates a persistent volume for your data. Hit http://localhost:8080, set up your account, and you're building flows. No compose yaml, no external DBs for starters.\n\nUpgrades are just as painless (this part surprised me most):  \n\n```bash\n\ndocker pull sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\ndocker stop a2n && docker rm a2n\n\n# re-run the original docker run command\n\n```\n\nYour workflows, credentials, and history stay untouched in the volume. No migrations to worry about for patch updates; it's been smooth every time I've done it.\n\nWhat it's given me in practice:\n\n\\- Drag-and-drop builder that feels familiar  \n\n\\- 30+ nodes covering Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio, various LLMs (OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok) with real AI agent tool calling  \n\n\\- Real-time logs and monitoring so flows don't ghost-fail  \n\n\\- No forced branding/white-label crap – deploy on my local machine or cheap VPS, it's mine  \n\n\\- Unlimited everything when self-run  \n\nOf course it's not perfect yet – node library is practical but growing, custom code nodes are basic compared to some heavyweights, and for big traffic I'd add external DB/Redis + proxy anyway. But for indie-scale stuff? It's cut my procrastination by a ton. I actually ship automations now instead of dreaming about them.\n\nIf you've ever felt that same setup wall blocking you from owning more of your tools, give that command a spin. Takes under a minute to test. No commitment.\n\nWhat's the one thing that's stopped you from self-hosting more workflows lately – the multi-service setup, upgrade paranoia, or just not worth the weekend? Genuinely curious – your pain points are probably why I kept iterating on this. 🚀",

The gap between \"I just want a couple agents and workflows\" and \"I am now running half of a data platform\" is real.\n\nOne thing I have found helpful is making tool calling a first class concept (permissions, dry run, logs) because otherwise agents + automations get spooky fast when something breaks at 2am.\n\nCurious, do you have any guardrails for agent tool calls out of the box (confirmations, allowlists, rate limits)?

One command to run locally.\n\n**What you traded:** Debuggability.

I'm trying to solve the same thing but for the agent side - we deploy, train, and manage OpenClaw agents for people so they get a working agent in 24 hours without touching a terminal. Early days, running a waitlist at [clawhost-wine.vercel.app](https://clawhost-wine.vercel.app/) if anyone's curious.\n\nDifferent tools but same philosophy - the setup tax shouldn't be higher than the value you get from the thing.",

I run Claude Code locally and it handles everything on the server over SSH — compose files, debugging, volume configs, networking. When something breaks I just describe the problem and it fixes it.\n\nWent from spending weekends fighting YAML to spinning up new services in hours — browser automation, monitoring bots, APIs. And I'm not a devops person. The AI handles the stuff I'd normally get stuck on (permissions, container health checks, proxy configs) while I focus on what I actually want to build.\n\nThe one-liner Docker approach is cool for getting started, but real self-hosting always ends up needing tweaks. Having something that can just SSH in, read the logs, and fix the issue is a different level of productivity.",

      "text": "Sharing this because it genuinely surprised me how approachable this is.\n\n**The Problem:** Need marketing videos, hate video editing, can't justify hiring someone yet.\n\n**The Solution:** Remotion (programmatic video) + AI for code generation.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Describe your video concept conversationally to Claude/GPT\n2. Get React components that define animations, timing, layouts\n3. Run `npm run build` and get an MP4\n4. Iterate by tweaking the code (not fighting a timeline)\n\n**Why this clicked for me:**\n\n* If you know React/JS, the learning curve is basically zero\n* AI handles the \"how do I animate this\" questions\n* Version control for videos (it's just code)\n* Way faster than After Effects for simple stuff\n\nI'm not saying this replaces professional motion design, but for indie hackers making App Store previews, product demos, or social content? Game changer.\n\nThe video I made isn't going to win awards, but it's professional enough and I made it myself in an afternoon.\n\nDrop a comment if you want to know more about the specific prompts/setup. Happy to share what worked.\n\nP.S: if u are curious about the application, u can find details here: [www.photo2calendar.it](http://www.photo2calendar.it)",

No migration pain, no downtime surprises.\n\nWhat you actually get in that single container:\n\n\\- Drag-and-drop canvas (React Flow style – very similar to n8n feel)  \n\n\\- 30+ practical nodes: Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok, webhooks, schedules, HTTP, SQL, JS/Python code, AI agents with real tool calling  \n\n\\- Real-time run logs & monitoring (see exactly what fails and why)  \n\n\\- No forced white-label or branding – deploy anywhere, it’s your instance  \n\n\\- Unlimited workflows & executions (no artificial caps)  \n\nTrade-offs to keep expectations real: node count is focused on high-ROI stuff (growing fast, but not 1000+ yet), custom scripting depth is lighter, and for heavy traffic you’ll eventually want external DB/Redis + reverse proxy. But for 90% of indie use cases? This has been a massive unlock.\n\nI’ve got mine running on a $5/mo VPS handling content queues, lead bots, and daily reports — zero monthly tool bills, full control, and upgrades take 30 seconds.\n\nIf the self-host tax (or freelancer tax) has kept you from automating more of your business, try that one command tonight. Worst case you \\`docker rm\\` and move on.\n\nWhat’s the one automation you’ve been delaying because setup cost or ongoing fees felt too high?

      "text": "A few months back I hit a wall that felt way too familiar for solo builders. I had this list of automations I desperately wanted for my own projects: auto-pull leads from Sheets to CRM, daily content queues posting to X, AI agents summarizing customer feedback into Slack. Self-hosting was the obvious choice – own the data, no $50/mo SaaS creep, unlimited runs.\n\nBut every attempt ended the same way.  \n\nFriday night: **Tonight's the night.**\n\nSaturday morning: compose up → errors about connection refused.  \n\nSaturday afternoon: install external Postgres, tweak volumes, set secrets.  \n\nSunday: one flow works, but the next update breaks Redis queue, and I'm googling **n8n docker volume migration** at 3 PM. Motivation gone. Tab closed. **Later.**\n\nThe real cost wasn't the hours – it was the ideas that never shipped. I realized the setup tax was higher than any subscription I'd avoided.\n\nAfter enough frustration, I decided to hack together a version of the a2n engine (the one running my hosted side at a2n.io) that removed every unnecessary step. Embedded DBs, no external services needed for starters, pre-built image. The goal: deploy in one line, upgrade without fear, focus on building flows not babysitting infra.\n\nRepo guide here: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nThe moment that clicked for me – the single command:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nDocker pulls everything, starts it, persists data in a volume. Hit http://localhost:8080, set admin password, and I'm dragging nodes. No yaml compose, no separate containers.\n\nUpgrades turned out even better than expected (this was the biggest win):  \n\n```bash\n\ndocker pull sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\ndocker stop a2n && docker rm a2n\n\n# re-run the docker run line above\n\n```\n\nFlows, credentials, history stay in the volume. No schema migrations for patches, no data wipe. I've done it a dozen times now – takes 20 seconds, zero surprises.\n\nWhat it's unlocked since then:\n\n\\- Visual builder with the drag-drop feel I like  \n\n\\- 30+ nodes hitting the stuff I actually use: Sheets/Slack/Notion/Telegram/Gmail/Discord/GitHub/Twilio + LLMs (OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok) with agent tool calling  \n\n\\- Live execution logs so I see failures immediately  \n\n\\- No branding/white-label forced – runs local or on a $5 VPS, looks/feels like mine  \n\n\\- Unlimited scale without caps  \n\nIt's not competing with enterprise beasts on node count or ultra-custom code yet – focused on practical indie flows. For high-traffic, external DB/Redis + proxy makes sense. But for my scale? The \"deploy and forget\" part has been huge. More ideas shipped, less guilt over unfinished tabs.\n\nIf you've ever felt that same infra friction blocking your own automations, try the command sometime. It's low-stakes to poke at.\n\nWhat's been your biggest self-host blocker lately – the compose complexity, upgrade anxiety, or just the weekend time sink? Sharing because your stories probably mirror why I kept simplifying this thing. 🚀",

      "text": "You spot a repetitive task that begs for automation – like Sheet syncs or Slack pings – and think \"I'll self-host this for privacy and no limits.\" But then the reality bites: wrestling with compose files, spinning up Postgres and Redis, chasing env vars... it turns a quick win into a weekend sinkhole, and you bail back to hosted options or manual drudgery.\n\nThat setup tax has derailed too many of my projects. For the lighter, everyday flows that actually get used, I needed something that deploys without the drama.\n\nSo I made the engine behind \\*\\***a2n.io**\\*\\* available to run locally via Docker, with full steps in the repo: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio  \n\n(It's your guide to pulling and running the pre-built image – plug-and-play style.)\n\n**Just one step to deploy and run:**\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nDocker handles the pull automatically, starts it up, and you're at http://localhost:8080 setting up your admin in seconds. Embedded Postgres + Redis mean no extra services or config for dev/small setups – seamless upgrades too (just pull the latest image and restart, your data stays safe in the volume).\n\nWhat you get firing on all cylinders:\n\n\\- Drag-and-drop canvas for building flows (nodes, connections – feels familiar)\n\n\\- 30+ solid integrations: Google Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok, webhooks, schedules, HTTP/SQL, JS/Python code, AI agents with tool calling\n\n\\- Real-time monitoring and logs – watch executions live, catch issues fast\n\n\\- No white-label restrictions or forced branding – deploy anywhere (local, VPS, whatever), your instance is yours\n\n\\- Unlimited workflows/executions (no caps like hosted free tiers)\n\nHonest trade-offs: Node library focuses on practical 80/20 stuff (growing, but not massive yet), custom scripting is lighter, and for big/exposed prod, add external DB/Redis + proxy for scale/security. Community's small since it's fresh.\n\nI've got mine on a basic VPS handling daily bots and summaries – upgrades are painless, no breakage surprises.\n\nIf that initial Docker friction has kept you from more self-hosted wins, try the command. It's low-risk to test.\n\nWhat's the biggest setup blocker for you with self-host tools? Dependencies, upgrade fears, or something else? Spill it – this is aimed at fixing those exact pains. 🚀",

What stack are you running this on?\n\nMy main question would be around updates/migrations - how does it handle upgrading the underlying containers without nuking data? That's usually where the pain lives for me with self-hosted stuff. Initial setup is annoying but survivable, its the 6-months-later \"I need to update this and I forgot how everything connects\" that kills projects.",

          "text": "Embedded postgres and redis in a single container is nice for the initial setup, but that's also what makes me nervous long term. If the container dies and your volume gets corrupted you lose everything - your workflows, your execution history, all of it. At least with compose you can back up postgres independently.\n\nHonest question though, how does this compare to just running n8n with sqlite? That's already a single docker run command and has way more integrations.",
