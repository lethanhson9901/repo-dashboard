Almost every mistake founders make is doing the right thing at the wrong time: ads before pull, investors before users, polish before proof, scale before fit.\n\nThe “do things that don’t scale” + staying employed while bootstrapping combo is especially underrated. It buys you patience, and patience is basically a superpower in the early stage. Most people don’t fail because the idea is bad, they fail because they run out of emotional or financial runway.\n\nAlso +1 on refunds and free early access. Trust compounds faster than revenue at the beginning, and people who feel treated fairly come back later. Congrats on $12k/mo, and thanks for sharing the unglamorous parts instead of a victory lap.",

But if I made it fully free, would they even value it enough to give real feedback? Classic chicken-and-egg.\n\n\\#5 and #8 also feel spot-on. I'm posting daily across TikTok, Reddit, LinkedIn, X - testing what actually converts. Zero paid ads yet because I haven't cracked organic. Feels like I'm throwing spaghetti at the wall but at least I'm learning what sticks haha.\n\nQuestion: when you kept it free at the start, how long until you switched to paid? And did you grandfather the free users or convert them?\n\nAlso curious - did you build aicofounder solo or with a co-founder (given #14)? 😄",

      "text": "I see a lot of people struggling with moving past the $100 MRR milestone, so I’m sharing the exact sequence I used to go from $0 to $600 without an audience or paid ads.\n\n**1) Getting the first customers**\n\nI didn’t create content or try to build an audience first. This is too slow. I didn’t even launch on Product Hunt (in fact I still haven’t launched there). Instead, I reached out directly to people who were clearly my target audience and offered them to try out my tool for free.\n\nThose conversations did two things at once:\n\n* I got people to try out my tool even tho I didn’t have any social proof\n* I got to understand exactly what kind of solution are they looking for\n\nOnce their free trial would end, I’d see if they convert. If not, I’d reach out again and ask why. All this feedback made me understand in which direction to take the product, how to position, and how to price. Whenever I’d get an insight, I’d implement it, and continue with reaching out to people. And eventually, I got my first couple of paying customers.\n\n**2) Getting to $100 MRR**\n\nThe approach above is how I got to $100 MRR and my first testimonials I could put on my landing page. But once I hit the $100 mark, I noticed something important: users were churning.\n\nSo instead of doing more outreach, I paused and switched focus to talking to people who canceled to understand why. Based on what they’d tell me, I’d implement changes, then go back to doing outreach to see if those changes actually made a difference. This loop of feedback + reiteration lasted 3 months.\n\nBy the end of it, I had:\n\n* better offer\n* better landing page\n* better activation\n* higher signups\n* lower churn\n\nAt this point, my funnel finally felt healthy, so it made sense to go all-in on marketing again.\n\n**3) Growing to $600 MRR**\n\nOnce the funnel felt healthy and users were actually sticking around, I went back to doing cold outreach and that alone got me to around $200 MRR.\n\nAt this point, I had a solid product, a working outreach system and had learned valuable strategies and insights I could share with my target audience. That’s when creating content started to make sense.\n\nI took real lessons and wins and started sharing them on X and Reddit. Since these lessons were based on my real experience, they were actually valuable and resonated with my audience. Those posts brought in more traffic and customers, which would give me new lessons and insights, which I could use to create new content. And this loop helped add $100 MRR every week.\n\nSo long story short, keep talking to your ideal customers, keep iterating on your offer, and keep repeating this until things click. Once they do, that’s when you start stacking other marketing channels.\n\nIf you want to see proof and the actual timeline of my growth, you can [see it here.](https://trustmrr.com/startup/bazzly)\n\nHappy to answer any questions or go deeper so you can apply this to your SaaS!",

Most people try to do content first because it feels safer than cold outreach, but you end up writing content without understanding what actually resonates because you haven't talked to enough customers yet.\n\n  \nOne thing i'd add: the transition from outreach to content works because you've earned the insights. When you share \"lessons learned\" without the learning, it reads like generic advice. When you share lessons that cost you 3 months of churn conversations, people can tell the difference.\n\n  \nSolid playbook.",

Spent two months just doing calls with churned users and realized the core problem was completely different from what I assumed.\n\nThe content flywheel you describe in step 3 is real. Once you have genuine stories from building and iterating, the content basically writes itself. I started sharing little workflow tips related to my app's problem space on Reddit and Twitter, and it brings in way more qualified leads than any cold outreach I've done.\n\nOne thing I'd add: for mobile/desktop apps specifically, App Store optimization compounds nicely alongside the content strategy.

The \"free work\" offers are usually win-win when approached correctly - the person offering gets portfolio pieces and real-world experience, the person receiving gets free help with something they'd otherwise pay for or skip entirely.\n\nThe catch most people miss: you get what you scope. If you approach these with \"can you review my landing page,\" you'll get surface-level feedback. If you approach with \"here's my landing page, my target customer is X, my main CTA is Y, I'm seeing Z% bounce rate - what's not working?\" you'll get actionable insights.\n\nThe other pattern I've noticed: the people offering free work often become paid service providers later. If someone does a great job on a free automation for you, they're now a known quantity when you need paid work done. Relationship building works both ways.\n\nOne thing to watch out for - some of these offers are lead gen funnels disguised as free help. Nothing wrong with that, but worth knowing going in.",

Plus custom commission rates, with a simple dashboard so creators can track earnings themselve, and yes it's stripe-native tracking, so it scales past spreadsheets without becoming a mess as you scale.

      "text": "I have a theory about why so many founders get stuck in the \"False Start.\"\n\nIt’s not because we aren't smart. It’s because we are chemically addicted to the Yellow Hat.\n\nIn the 1980s, Dr. Edward de Bono invented a framework called \"Six Thinking Hats.\" The idea is that the human brain (and now, the AI brain) struggles to do everything at once.\n\nYou can’t be creative and critical at the exact same time.\n\nSo, he separated thinking into six distinct modes:\n\n* ⚪ The White Hat: Data & Facts. \"What do the numbers say?\"\n* 🔴 The Red Hat: Emotion & Intuition. \"Does this feel exciting?\"\n* 🟡 The Yellow Hat: Optimism. \"Why will this work?\"\n* 🟢 The Green Hat: Creativity. \"What are the alternatives?\"\n* ⚫ The Black Hat: Judgment & Caution. \"Why will this fail?\"\n* 🔵 The Blue Hat: Control. \"Are we following the process?\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0l99fnz8ghhg1.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=2697ea5d56fff7c0f706da5f68883278a16a6b03\n\n**Here's the problem**:\n\nWhen you come up with a startup idea, you are usually wearing the Red Hat (Excitement).\n\nWhen you pitch an idea to ChatGPT (or a supportive friend), they instantly put on the Yellow Hat (Support) and the Green Hat (Ideation). They tell you it’s a \"great initiative.\" They list the benefits and 10 more features you could build. They feed your excitement.\n\nYou feel good. So you start building.\n\nBut nobody put on the Black Hat.\n\nNobody asked: \"What happens if the API costs triple?\" or \"Why would a user switch from Excel to this?\"\n\nYou build a product based on Yellow Hat energy, only to get crushed by Black Hat reality three months later.\n\n**Why ChatGPT can't help you here:**\n\nChatGPT is trained to be helpful and agreeable. It's optimized for user satisfaction. When you're excited about an idea, it mirrors that excitement because that's what makes you happy.\n\nIt's not being malicious. It's doing exactly what it was trained to do: support you.\n\nBut support isn't what you need on Day 1. You need someone to attack your idea. You need the Black Hat.\n\n**What I do now:**\n\nBefore I build anything, I force myself to spend 10 minutes in pure Black Hat mode.\n\nI pretend I'm a hater trying to destroy my idea. I ask:\n\n* What's the fatal flaw I'm ignoring?\n* What assumption will break me?\n* Why would this fail even if I execute perfectly?\n\nIt's uncomfortable. My brain fights it. But 2 out of 3 ideas collapse under Black Hat pressure.\n\nAnd that's good. Better to kill a fragile idea in 10 minutes than after 4 months of building.\n\n**Try this today:**\n\nLook at the project you're working on right now. You've probably spent weeks in Yellow Hat mode (thinking about launch, revenue, growth).\n\nPut on the Black Hat for 10 minutes. Be ruthless. If you were a skeptical investor or a competitor, where would you strike?\n\nIf your idea survives 10 minutes of the Black Hat, you might actually have something.",

Don't soften the truth. Don't flatter.\n\nChallenge my thinking, question my assumptions, and expose the blind spots I'm avoiding. Be direct, rational, and unfiltered.\n\nIf my reasoning is weak, dissect it and show why.\n\nIf I'm fooling myself or lying to myself, point it out.\n\nIf I'm avoiding something uncomfortable or wasting time, call it out and explain the opportunity cost.\n\nLook at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth.\n\nShow me where I'm making excuses, playing small, or underestimating risks/effort.\n\nThen give a precise, prioritized plan what to change in thought, action, or mindset to reach the next level.\n\nHold nothing back.

Do you notice it drifting back to validation after 10-15 exchanges, or does it stay sharp?\n\nI've found that prompts like this work brilliantly for the first part of a conversation, but the RLHF conditioning is so deep that it eventually softens.

Tear this apart.\" Works surprisingly well. The key is making the persona specific — vague instructions like \"be critical\" get softened by its training, but a defined character with motivation holds up better.\n\nThat said, your 10-minute solo Black Hat exercise is probably still more valuable. There's something about your own brain generating the objections that makes them stick. When ChatGPT does it, it feels like reading criticism. When you do it yourself, you actually feel the uncomfortable \"oh shit\" moment where an assumption crumbles.\n\nThe Yellow Hat addiction thing is real though. I've definitely shipped things that felt great during the building phase and only realized later I was high on my own supply the whole time.",

It was from showing something half-built to people who had zero investment in being nice to me. A stranger saying \"I wouldn't use this\" hits different than imagining they might say it.\n\nMaybe the real move is: Yellow Hat with AI to explore ideas fast → Black Hat solo to kill the obvious bad ones → then external Black Hat (real people) before investing serious time.

Cut the crap\n\nYou maybe get half a second to get that attention so let’s remove the crap :\n\n* The sweet spot is 7–9 words & around 40–55 characters.\n* One clear sentence, no buzzwords, no “revolutionizing X with AI”.\n* No random emojis, no ALL CAPS, no “best-in-class” type claims.\n\n1. Be clear\n\nIf your tagline doesn’t answer “what does this do, and for who?” in that half second, they scroll past.\n\nThe best-performing taglines all did one of these two things:\n\n* Outcome-first: “Turn abandoned carts into revenue for Shopify stores.” (more demos booked, fewer bugs, faster support.)\n* Audience-first: “Analytics that non-technical founders actually understand.” (SaaS founders, agencies, solopreneurs, Shopify stores, recruiters.)\n\n1. Link with an action verb\n\nTo make a proper tagline, you need a clear verb: turn, track, collect, launch, ship.\n\nIt will connect the feature to the audience, or to the outcome or the audience to the outcome, your choice.\n\nI reverse‑engineered patterns from standout vs invisible launches and [turned it into a small playbook.](https://startuphunt.io/before-you-launch)\n\nIt breaks down:\n\n* How they picked categories that actually sent traffic\n* How they timed launches across directories\n* How they wrote one‑line pitches people clicked\n* What failed launches looked like on the same sites\n\nA fun exercise to prove how good it is : Give me your current tagline (and website) and I’ll recraft your tagline",

Repo here: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nOne-liner to spin it up:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nHit http://localhost:8080 and you're in. Built-in embedded DB + Redis so no external services needed for quick tests. For real use, just pass your own Postgres/Redis URLs and secrets.\n\nWhat you get out of the box:\n\n\\- Same visual builder: nodes, connections, real-time execution/logs\n\n\\- 30+ integrations: Google Sheets/Slack/Notion/Telegram/Gmail/GitHub/Discord/OpenAI/Twilio/etc.\n\n\\- Built-in AI agent nodes (supports OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Grok – tool use and all)\n\n\\- No white-label restrictions or forced branding – it's MIT licensed, your instance, your rules\n\n\\- Unlimited executions/workflows when self-hosted (no artificial caps)\n\nIt's not a 1:1 n8n clone—node library is smaller (growing), no ultra-deep custom code nodes yet, but for the 80% of practical flows that actually ship? This cuts the deployment pain to almost zero.\n\nI've been running it locally and on a cheap VPS—feels snappy, data stays private, and no more \"update broke my instance\" surprises.\n\nIf you're tired of heavy orchestration for simple things, give the Docker image a spin and tell me what breaks first (or what you'd want added). What's stopping you from self-hosting more automations right now—setup complexity, missing nodes, or just not worth the hassle? Genuinely want to hear.",

Especially when you're just trying to get a quick webhook → Slack flow or AI agent that summarizes emails running locally or on a VPS.\n\nI got fed up with it, so I open-sourced the full backend that powers **a2n.io** and made it ridiculously easy to self-host. Repo: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nTry this one-liner right now:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nOpen http://localhost:8080, create your admin account, and you're building flows. Embedded DB + Redis mean **zero** external dependencies for dev, testing, or small personal use. (For production, swap in your own DATABASE\\_URL and REDIS\\_URL – still simple.)\n\nWhat you actually get in that container:\n\n\\- Drag-and-drop canvas (React Flow style – feels familiar if you've used n8n)\n\n\\- 30+ built-in nodes: Webhook/Schedule triggers, Google Sheets/Slack/Notion/Telegram/Gmail/Discord/GitHub/Twilio/OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok, HTTP/GraphQL/SQL, JS/Python code, filters/loops/if-else, file handling, and more\n\n\\- Real AI agent nodes that reason, call tools, and chain LLMs – no extra setup\n\n\\- Live execution monitoring + logs so you see runs happen in real time\n\n\\- MIT license – completely yours, **no white-label forced branding**, no phoning home, unlimited workflows/executions\n\nIt's MIT, so fork it, strip it, brand it, whatever. Your data never leaves your server.\n\nTrade-offs (being straight up):\n\n\\- Node library is smaller than n8n's massive ecosystem (growing, but focused on practical 80/20 stuff)\n\n\\- No ultra-advanced custom scripting depth yet (though JS/Python nodes exist)\n\n\\- Embedded mode is great for quick spins but use external DB/Redis + reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy/Traefik) for anything exposed or high-traffic\n\n\\- Project is new – repo just went public, so community is tiny and battle-testing is early\n\nI've got mine humming on a cheap VPS for daily drivers (Sheet syncs, notification bots, AI summaries) – deploys fast, runs stable, feels light compared to heavier stacks.\n\nIf the usual self-host setup tax has kept you from running more automations privately, pull the image and mess around for 5 minutes. Worst case, you delete the container.\n\nWhat usually stops you from self-hosting workflow tools like this? The multi-service compose files, worrying about updates breaking things, missing niche nodes, or just \"hosted is easier for now\"? Real talk appreciated – this is meant to scratch that exact itch.",

One time the backups didn't even exist. Recently tested a Postgres backup from Supabase — it was there but incomplete. Missing tables, truncated data.\n\nLooked for solutions: Veeam and Commvault do backup validation, but only inside their own ecosystem at enterprise pricing. Nothing vendor-agnostic for SMBs.\n\nSo I'm building it. The concept:\n→ Deploy a runner on your infra\n→ It restores your backup in an isolated container\n→ Runs verification (SQL queries, file checks, archive integrity)\n→ Signs the report cryptographically\n→ Destroys everything — zero data leaves your network\n\nDashboard for CTOs and auditors (ISO 27001 / SOC 2).\n\nSolo founder, Go + Vue.js, MVP nearly done.
