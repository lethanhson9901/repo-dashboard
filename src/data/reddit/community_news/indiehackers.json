Aye Chat is intentionally CLI-first and stays close to the traditional terminal experience.  \n  \nAlso, the main difference from other similar tools like Claude Code or GitHub Copilot is the workflow: instead of asking permission to apply changes that AI generates, it writes to files automatically but provides a way to immediately undo those changes. This tends to work well for experiments and prototyping.",

They produce offspring or kill each other either for fun or ressources. They build factions and their own structures. You can’t control any of that just observe and hand them the tools. \n\nThe game is a whooping 750KB file that basically lives and breathes your CPU as if it finally can express itself. \n\nTry it and let me know what you think!",

It works like a public leaderboard of startups and directories, but only with real, validated views that update live.\n\nNo edited screenshots, no made‑up metrics. The numbers on each public page come from the same script (or GA4) that powers the site’s own analytics, so what you see is what actually happened.\n\nThe main reason this exists is that founders constantly struggle with proof: some oversell their traction with nice‑looking dashboards, while others undersell it because they have no simple, credible way to showcase their real traffic. (I did)\n\nMy dream long term is to have blogs and directories listed there, since **views** are literally their business model, and hosting those numbers on a neutral third‑party page would be insanely OP for transparency and trust with their users.\n\nWould love ideas on things like:  \n– Should there be space for founder notes or context around spikes and dips?  \n– As a founder, would you feel comfortable linking to a public traffic page from your landing, newsletter, or launch post?\n\nOpen to any feedback. Right now, TrustViews is already being used in the wild: \n\n**82 Websites Verifying A Total Of 156,517 Views.**",

I built things that were too complicated, based on \"stupid\" unique ideas, or had zero plan for distribution. I thought the product had to be revolutionary to work.\n\nThen I launched my last two projects. They were simpler. They weren't trying to change the world, just solve a problem. And guess what? They’re the only ones that actually made money and are growing right now.\n\nThat’s when it clicked.\n\nI spend hours every day looking at new startups, and I’m honestly shocked at what I see. People are building incredibly simple tools—stuff you could clone in a weekend with AI—and making real money because they nailed the audience, not the code.\n\nSo I’m pivoting.\n\nI’m launching Startup Hunt, a weekly deep dive where I break down these simple, money-making products and exactly how they’re getting users. No fluff, just the \"boring\" stuff that actually pays the bills.\n\nI’m sending the very first issue this Monday. It’s fully free, and I’m just excited to share what I’m finding.\n\nCheck it out here:  \n[startuphunt.io](https://startuphunt.io/)",

I tried to find out how to fix the days but got tired of trying bc I couldn’t figure it out. \n\nAlso when i subscribed… it took arbout 5-10 mins to register that I paid for a membership”\n\nOuch, felt the user’s pain point immediately and  was embarrassed about the app. I explained how to use the app, but ultimately linked them to apples refund page as I wasn’t going to try and trick them out of their money.\n\nI then followed up when they got their refund and gave them 3 months free. No reply, not been active since. Bummer\n\nBut I got some extremely useful feedback! I improved the onboarding flow to show how dates could be added to workouts and opened a ticket to investigate the delayed membership result on their account\n\nSo always reach out immediately I caught this guy when he was still frustrated enough to give me his opinion\n\nFor any wondering my app is: https://www.gymnoteplus.com",

And then follow up again a few days later asking for feedback again. That way you can build the relationship and open the line of communication with them. \n\nWe do this at Dreamlit and it's fantastic for getting feedback / meetings on the cal with customers. And we see many of our own customers using us to do the same (we're an AI email automation platform)",

That's the foundation.\n\nLaser focus SEO: Don't try to rank for everything. Pick 1-2 highly relevant keywords.\n\nBatch content: Dedicate specific blocks of time (e.g., weekends) for content creation.\n\nAI as research: Use AI tools (like Jasper or ChatGPT) for keyword research, competitor analysis, and outlining. Don't rely on them for writing the core content - that's still your expertise.\n\nLow-effort SEO: Focus on foundational SEO: title tags, meta descriptions, internal linking.\n\nDon't strive for perfection:  \"Good enough\" is often better than \"perfect\" when you're a solo founder.\n\nTrack & iterate: Monitor your traffic and adjust your strategy based on what's working.\n\nEssentially, treat SEO as a supporting function, not the primary focus.",

But your FluidCalendar win came from being in the right place at the right time with something people actually wanted.  \n  \nWith 20+ products, you're sitting on a goldmine of solutions to real problems. The challenge is connecting them to the people who need them RIGHT NOW. Some ideas: Double down on what worked - that FluidCalendar post worked, can you do more posts like it sharing the story, the tech, the journey? Pick your top 3 products and really focus distribution there since 20 products means scattered attention. Find the watering holes - for FluidCalendar it might be productivity Twitter, , indie hacker communities. Build in public more - your story is genuinely interesting, 20+ products, a viral moment, still grinding. People root for that.  \n  \nI'd love to dig into your products and help you figure out which ones have the most distribution potential. DM me if you want to chat!",

You have to mess around with prompts, figure out a workflow that doesn’t fight you, decide what’s worth automating and what’s better left manual. Once it clicks though, it starts compounding fast.\n\nMy setup is honestly pretty basic: Perplexity when I need quick research or a sanity check, ChatGPT for outlines and reshaping drafts, Cursor while I’m building so the product and the content move together, and n8n for the glue stuff (publishing, syncing drafts, tracking ideas, all the boring admin).\n\nSo I don’t really “balance” product vs content anymore. I try to smash them into the same loop. Build something, write as I go, ship, let automation mop up the rest.\n\nThe tools help, sure.

      "text": "**Note: FOCUS is mobile apps not web.**\n\nMy post about finding an exposed OpenAI key got a lot of responses asking \"okay but how do I actually fix this?\"\n\nHere's the simplest setup that works.\n\n**The problem:** Your app needs to call OpenAI. If you put the API key in your app code, anyone can extract it. Doesn't matter if it's in .env files or environment variables. Once it's in the bundle, it's public.\n\n**The fix:** Your app calls YOUR server. Your server calls OpenAI. The key never leaves your server.\n\n    App → Your Backend → OpenAI\n            (key lives here)\n\n**What you need:**\n\n1. A cheap VPS (Hetzner €3.29/month, DigitalOcean $4/month, or free tier from Railway/Render)\n2. A simple proxy that forwards requests\n\n**The code (Go, \\~50 lines):**\n\n    func proxyOpenAI(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        // Your key stays on the server\n        apiKey := os.Getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n        \n        // Forward the request to OpenAI\n        req, _ := http.NewRequest(r.Method, \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\", r.Body)\n        req.Header.Set(\"Authorization\", \"Bearer \"+apiKey)\n        req.Header.Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n        \n        resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)\n        if err != nil {\n            http.Error(w, \"API error\", 500)\n            return\n        }\n        defer resp.Body.Close()\n        \n        // Return response to your app\n        w.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n        io.Copy(w, resp.Body)\n    }\n\n**Your app calls:**\n\n    fetch('https://your-server.com/api/chat', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + userToken },\n      body: JSON.stringify({ \n        app_id: 'my-fitness-app',  // identifies your app\n        message: userInput \n      })\n    })\n\n**Add basic auth so random people can't use your proxy:**\n\nYour app authenticates users (Supabase, Firebase, whatever). Your backend verifies that token before proxying. Now only your logged-in users can make requests.\n\n**Scaling to multiple apps:**\n\nI run one backend that serves multiple apps. Each app gets its own isolated SQLite database based on the app\\_id:\n\n    /data/\n    ├── noteapp/\n    │   └── cache.db\n    ├── fitness-app/\n    │   └── cache.db\n    └── recipe-app/\n        └── cache.db\n\nThe backend routes requests to the right database:\n\n    func getDB(appID string) (*DB, error) {\n        dbPath := fmt.Sprintf(\"./data/%s/cache.db\", appID)\n        return sql.Open(\"sqlite3\", dbPath)\n    }\n\nOne server. Multiple apps. Complete data isolation. If one app has a bug, it can't touch another app's data.\n\n**Cost:** I run this on a €3.29/month Hetzner VPS. Uses 10% CPU, under 500MB RAM. Handles 10-15 apps easily.\n\n**If you don't want to manage a server:**\n\n* Vercel Edge Functions (free tier)\n* Supabase Edge Functions (free tier)\n* Cloudflare Workers (free tier)\n\nAll let you store secrets as environment variables on their platform.\n\n**The point:**\n\nYour app should never know the real API key. It only knows how to talk to your backend. Your backend handles the secret.\n\n2 hours of setup. Saves you from a $XXXX OpenAI bill because someone found your key.",

Would you personally pay for something like this?\n2. What would make it worth paying for vs not?\n3. If you wouldn’t pay, what’s the main reason?\n\nNot launching or selling anything, just validating whether this solves a real enough problem before building.\n\nThanks for the honest feedback 🙏\n\n",

I'd consider paying if it consistently saved me 30+ minutes daily and led to quality job matches\n\n2. Worth paying if the conversion rate from alert to actual gig is notably higher than manual searching\n\n3.

The key isn’t install count, but whether **people’s behavior starts to change because others around them are using it**.\n\nEarly signals I’d consider meaningful:\n\n* People **mentioning or inviting others without being prompted**\n* Usage emerging in specific contexts (“this would be useful here”) rather than generic exploration\n* Feature requests that assume **group interaction**, not just individual convenience\n\nOn the flip side, my personal kill signals would be:\n\n* Usage staying purely event-driven even after achieving reasonable local density\n* Repeated feedback along the lines of “there’s no real reason to use this alone”\n* The product only staying alive when **external energy is constantly injected**\n\nI also relate to the discomfort around promotion. I’ve tried to approach it less as “please use this” and more as **showing how I’m trying to solve a shared problem**. That feels like the cleanest line between experimentation and self-promotion.\n\nIn the end, I think local network effects are less about scalability upfront and more about whether **natural social friction actually emerges**.",

Who is the first person you approach in practice? What is the actual opener that gets you access to 15–30 people without turning it into awkward self-promotion?

Can the tool solve a single person's friction within that local context before the network kicks in? If it requires 50 people to be useful, the coordination will always feel like noisy self-promotion because you're essentially asking people to invest in a future value that doesn't exist yet.\n\nThe most meaningful signal isn't the install, it's the unprompted \"invite\" or \"share\" within that micro-bubble. if you have to push every single new user in a campus or community, the organic loop isn't there.\n\nI'm currently building something to helo founders filter for these kinds of specific intent signals in online communities, and the biggest lesson so far is that the local density doesn't start solving a specific, loud pain for the first 5 people, it's usually not worth the manual grind to get to 50.",

So offline wins for small/medium datasets, but longer training (big CSV or Pro with NAS) heats up the phone more – that's why Lite limits epochs and we plan checkpointing + early stopping.\n\n\n\nSuper curious – what phone do you have? If you want to test the beta (APK + Docker backend) and share your battery numbers, I'd love to hear! DM me for the link.\n\n\n\nThanks again! 🚀",
