I’ve had the privilege of helping him shape it using my psychology expertise, testing it firsthand, and helping ensure it’s safe, user-led, and trauma-informed.\n\n\nPrivacy is built-in: nothing you share is sold or exposed, and even Adonis does not see your data.\n\n\nHe is adding a gentle, optional user assessment. It’s not a test, it’s not diagnostic, it simply helps Haven adapt to the user’s needs while fully respecting boundaries.\n\n\nYou can find Haven by searching for “Haven by Prometheus Systems” in your browser. For now, it works best on a Windows laptop or desktop, but an app is coming soon!\n\n\nHaven is always evolving. Any feedback you share would mean the world to Adonis, and me. Thank you for helping us make Haven even better.\n\n\n— Logan",

Massive system prompts don't scale when you have 50 different templates.\n\nThe solution I built is a SaaS that treats Markdown as the source of truth for agentic logic. Instead of a 2,000-word prompt, domain experts (lawyers, engineers, auditors) define the \"workflow\" in Markdown. The agent then runs this server-side via RPC, using the Markdown structure to maintain state and conduct a guided dialogue with the user.",

      "text": "I've been building software for over 15 years. Worked at Bloomberg and Shopify as an engineer, started a few companies. So when I started vibe coding with Lovable, I figured I'd skip most of the beginner mistakes. I was wrong about that.\n\nHere's what actually caught me off guard across 8 builds (affirmations app, pomodoro timer, cat of the day, dating bio rewriter, cancel plans generator, recipe app, workout timer, astrology app):\n\n**Auth is where most vibe-coded apps silently break.** Every AI tool will give you a login screen that works when you type in the right email and password. That's the happy path. But try entering wrong credentials, or sign up with a password that doesn't meet requirements, or test the Google OAuth flow when consent gets denied. Most of the time the error handling is either missing or the messages are gibberish. I spent more time fixing auth edge cases than building actual features on several of these apps. And here's the real kicker: I added a major feature to one of my apps and Lovable's model went and rewrote parts of my auth flow in the process. Suddenly nobody could log in. That regression cost me more time than the feature itself.\n\n**Meta-prompting changed my output quality overnight.** Instead of going straight to Lovable with \"build me an affirmations app,\" I started describing my product vision to Claude first and asking it to generate the Lovable prompt for me. Claude adds structure, specificity, visual design direction, page-by-page breakdowns. The difference in what Lovable produces from a meta-prompt vs. a cold prompt is dramatic. I do this for every build now.\n\n**The 90/90 problem is real.** AI gets you 90% of the way in about 90 seconds. The last 10%, error states, edge cases, polish, that's where 90% of your actual time goes. Most tutorials skip this part entirely, which is why so many people hit a wall after their first build looks great but doesn't actually hold up.\n\n**Niche apps outperform \"big idea\" apps every time.** I built a generic pomodoro timer and a pomodoro timer specifically for writers. The writer-specific one got more interest by a wide margin. Same with the workout timer. I didn't build it for gym people. I built it for people who hate the gym. The more specific your audience, the less competition you have and the more your users feel like you built it for them. Because you did.\n\n**Meme apps get traction that serious apps don't.** The cancel plans excuse generator got more attention than apps I spent significantly longer on. My take: we're in a moment where anyone can build an app in 20 minutes, so the ones that break through are the ones that make people laugh and hit share. Big companies can't afford to look ridiculous. Their brand won't let them. That makes silly apps surprisingly safe territory.\n\nThose were the big ones. Happy to get into specifics on any of these if people have questions. I've been documenting my builds so I have a lot of the details fresh.",

You know have to play the role of Database, IOS, Android, QA, Architect - is it's essential you understand how to architect software yourself to guide the AI conversations. I spend a lot of time going through periodic code reviews and then focus sessions on removing technical debt, ensuring patters are followed etc. This is particularly important as when you go back to feature development - consistent code patterns helps the AI understand the and interact with the code structure in a predictable way. Everything has units tests that get run all the time. However now that I am well past MVP (and it's the building side I enjoy the most) - more and more time is spent on generating interest, running betas, social media, etc. I suspect this will become more and more the case as it becomes easier to build very application software.

Not an impressive number by startup-Twitter standards, but it covers my devops costs, AI tools, and about half of my car payment. More importantly, it’s stable and still growing month over month.\n\nWhat surprised me most is that none of this came from TikTok hype, Instagram reels, or viral launches. No big audience. No “growth hacks.” Just a boring combination of shipping consistently, fixing UX friction, listening to user complaints, and iterating for months.\n\nPeople keep saying the app market is dead, SaaS is saturated, hardware is impossible, etc. From what I’m seeing, that’s mostly noise. Revenue still compounds if you keep improving something real. Whether you’re building a mobile app, a SaaS, or even a physical product: if users are getting value and you keep showing up, the curve eventually bends upward. It’s not glamorous, but it works.\n\nI’m still iterating on my app daily, and I expect it to keep growing and not because of hype, but because people actually use it.\n\n**If you’re in a slump right now: don’t stop.

Five years ago you needed a massive team to build something meaningful, now a solo founder can ship a full SaaS product using AI, no code platforms, and cloud infrastructure that scales automatically. The barrier to entry has never been lower, which means more problems are getting solved by people who actually understand them firsthand. Are you working on anything that takes advantage of these new capabilities?",

The problem is simple: default WooCommerce search is keyword-only, so when someone types \"gift for dad who likes gardening\" they get 0 results even if the store sells garden gloves and seed kits.\n\nJust launched on [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org) about a week ago. No viral moment, no big audience. What's working: posting in Facebook groups with a genuine \"here's a problem I solved\" angle. Got 44 downloads in one day from that. Total around 85 now. No paying customers yet, but people are trying it.\n\nThe hardest part isn't building - it's the gap between \"people download it\" and \"people actually use it and pay.\" Right now I'm trying to figure out where users drop off in the setup process. Classic activation problem.\n\nYour point about \"fixing UX friction and listening to user complaints\" hits hard. That's exactly where I am - the product works, now I need to make onboarding so smooth that non-technical store owners can set it up without thinking.\n\nWhat was the turning point for you between \"people download it\" and \"people actually pay\"?",

Here is what worked for me.\n\n  \nFor the ones I sold, I listed them on SideProjectors and got a buyer within a couple weeks for both. The key was being transparent about what the project actually had (some SEO juice, a working codebase, a decent domain) vs what it needed (marketing, time, maybe a pivot). Buyers appreciated honesty over hype.\n\n  \nOther places worth checking: [Acquire.com](http://Acquire.com) if the project has any revenue at all, even small. 1KProjects for stuff under $1k. Flippa works but its noisy, you will get a lot of tire kickers. Indiemaker is newer but specifically built for this.\n\n  \nFor the projects I let die, my biggest regret is not open sourcing them. If you cant sell it, throwing it on GitHub with a good README at least gives it a second life and sometimes drives traffic back to your other stuff.\n\n  \nOne thing I learned the hard way: the longer you wait, the less a project is worth. Domains expire, dependencies get outdated, whatever small SEO you had decays. If you know you are not coming back to it, list it now even if the price is embarrassingly low. Someone paying $200 for your abandoned project is better than it sitting there costing you renewal fees.",

Flippa was a waste of time, just lowballers and tire kickers. The thing that actually worked best was posting in niche communities related to the projects problem space, not as a sales pitch but more like \"hey i built this thing and dont have time for it, anyone want it?\" Got way more genuine interest that way than any marketplace.",

Got 2 paying customers, even had meetings with directors of global companies, but ultimately it is too much work to try to get customers and big companies are turned off from working with a solo founder.\n\n  \n2nd product: \"Strava for everything\". It was a social network where you can link all your APIs, e.g. Stripe, Steam, GitHub, YouTube, Chess etc and share your updates with friends. Still running, but I've stopped working on it, got about 50 signups.\n\n  \n3rd product: Helps people reduce their carbon emissions and save money. You can scan a product and it tells you lower carbon alternatives and the price difference. I did a startup programme for this at a university, got about 200 signups, some daily active users, but hard to increase retention and haven't implemented monetisation.\n\n  \n4th product: Filters your raw notification feed from X to only tell you replies that are relevant, based on your instructions. E.g. \"Only send me replies where people are asking about my product\". Saves time and prevents doomscrolling after you only went on X because someone liked your post. Started building it on Saturday, launched it on Sunday (last night). Link: [https://www.raw-bot.com/](https://www.raw-bot.com/)\n\nAfter the 3rd product, I decided that if I make another app it will have monetisation as the core feature and have it built in right away. Not \"build an app, get users and then hope you can monetise them later.\" I'd rather have 5 paying users than 200 free ones. So, that's what I've built, it's super basic but it provides value with the core feature. Let's see how it goes!  \n",

You know the problem intellectually but you don't feel it in your gut, so you make slightly off decisions about what matters.\n\n\n\nYour B2B review tool had paying customers and you walked away from it because distribution was painful.

It's a database of newly registered businesses, so you can reach out to fresh leads before everyone else piles on.\n\nSince you're already doing manual outreach, having access to contacts who literally just opened their doors could be huge for your timing. For what it's worth, most founders I've seen in your spot say their first real clients come from either direct outreach (like what you're doing) or being active in communities where their buyers hang out. The LinkedIn filter thing is smart because you're finding intent signals, but pairing that with a steady stream of brand new businesses to contact might give you more at-bats before runway hits zero.\n\nrooting for you, 30 days is tight but not impossible if you can get a few conversations going this week.",

A few weeks ago, I made \"[Honest PMM](https://thehonestpmm.com),\" a satirical landing page mocking SaaS tropes, specifically to drive traffic to Oden.\n\nIt was a marketing experiment. That's it.\n\nDid it work?\n\nKind of. The satirical page got way more attention than my actual product:\n\n\\- 756 users, 4K events on Honest PMM\n\n\\- Peaked around Jan 25 with \\~600 users in a day\n\n\\- Decent engagement, people actually played around with it\n\n\\- Traffic to Oden from it? Modest. Signups? 2\n\nSo the experiment was fun, got some laughs, sparked a few good DMs from PMMs venting about their actual problems. But it didn't convert the way I hoped.\n\nThe mistake I made:\n\nI should have launched Oden on Product Hunt when Honest PMM was peaking. I didn't. I was still tweaking things. Now the traffic is basically gone and I'm launching anyway.\n\nBut I am doing that now, Tell me how you would have capitalised the momentum?\n\nWould love of you could support the [PH launch](https://www.producthunt.com/products/oden?launch=oden)",

The real tool that does this properly is Oden\" with a one-click demo. You had 756 people on the page and almost no bridge between the joke and the product.\n\n  \n2) Captured emails on the satire page itself. Even a simple \"Want more PMM roasts? Drop your email\" would have given you a list to nurture. Those 756 users are gone forever now.\n\n  \n3) The PH launch timing you mentioned is correct but I would have gone further. Cross-post the satire to Twitter and LinkedIn tagging product marketing people, then launch Oden on PH the next day while the conversation is still warm. You want people seeing the joke and the real product within the same 48 hour window.\n\n  \n4) Turn the satirical content into a series. One viral page is a spike. A weekly roast of SaaS landing page tropes builds an audience that eventually becomes your funnel.\n\n  \nThe good news is the experiment proved something valuable: you can create content that gets attention. Most people cant do that at all. The missing piece is just the conversion infrastructure between the attention and the product.",

Especially when you're just trying to get a quick webhook → Slack flow or AI agent that summarizes emails running locally or on a VPS.\n\nI got fed up with it, so I open-sourced the full backend that powers **a2n.io** and made it ridiculously easy to self-host. Repo: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nTry this one-liner right now:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nOpen http://localhost:8080, create your admin account, and you're building flows. Embedded DB + Redis mean **zero** external dependencies for dev, testing, or small personal use. (For production, swap in your own DATABASE\\_URL and REDIS\\_URL – still simple.)\n\nWhat you actually get in that container:\n\n\\- Drag-and-drop canvas (React Flow style – feels familiar if you've used n8n)\n\n\\- 30+ built-in nodes: Webhook/Schedule triggers, Google Sheets/Slack/Notion/Telegram/Gmail/Discord/GitHub/Twilio/OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok, HTTP/GraphQL/SQL, JS/Python code, filters/loops/if-else, file handling, and more\n\n\\- Real AI agent nodes that reason, call tools, and chain LLMs – no extra setup\n\n\\- Live execution monitoring + logs so you see runs happen in real time\n\n\\- MIT license – completely yours, **no white-label forced branding**, no phoning home, unlimited workflows/executions\n\nIt's MIT, so fork it, strip it, brand it, whatever. Your data never leaves your server.\n\nTrade-offs (being straight up):\n\n\\- Node library is smaller than n8n's massive ecosystem (growing, but focused on practical 80/20 stuff)\n\n\\- No ultra-advanced custom scripting depth yet (though JS/Python nodes exist)\n\n\\- Embedded mode is great for quick spins but use external DB/Redis + reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy/Traefik) for anything exposed or high-traffic\n\n\\- Project is new – repo just went public, so community is tiny and battle-testing is early\n\nI've got mine humming on a cheap VPS for daily drivers (Sheet syncs, notification bots, AI summaries) – deploys fast, runs stable, feels light compared to heavier stacks.\n\nIf the usual self-host setup tax has kept you from running more automations privately, pull the image and mess around for 5 minutes. Worst case, you delete the container.\n\nWhat usually stops you from self-hosting workflow tools like this? The multi-service compose files, worrying about updates breaking things, missing niche nodes, or just \"hosted is easier for now\"? Real talk appreciated – this is meant to scratch that exact itch.",

On my actual feed.\n\nI filter posts from my network:\n\n* founders mentioning problems\n* recruiters posting roles before they go public\n* CTOs talking about their roadmap\n* companies I'm connected to announcing growth\n\nI'm looking for off-market opportunities, the kind you can't find scrolling job boards.\n\nYesterday someone asked if I'd tried raising funds or reaching out to VCs. Honestly, that feels like a longer, more uncertain road right now and my anxiety is already high enough.\n\nSo I'm at a crossroads:\n\n1. Stop everything. Close the experiment, focus on getting hired.\n2. Keep going. Use my own product to find opportunities and see what happens even if it's risky.\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nI'll post Day 28 tomorrow and share whether this actually led anywhere.",

Before that, I had been doing some indie hacking on and off, but I never planned to quit my job for it.\n\nGetting laid off changed things. Even if I found a new job, the anxiety of “I could be let go again anytime” really stuck with me. That’s when I started taking indie hacking more seriously, while still consistently applying for jobs in parallel.\n\nTo be honest about the results so far: there haven’t been many. I haven’t been able to land a job for months (and the developer job market is extremely tough globally right now). On top of that, I’m in a situation where I don’t have enough savings to cover living expenses much longer, so if I don’t get a job soon, things get very difficult.\n\nBecause of that, I’ve decided to pause indie hacking for now and focus fully on job hunting. It’s been about two weeks already.\n\nI’ve completely stopped building, although I’m still doing some promotion and sharing what I’ve built. but there’s no clear signal of when (or if) that will lead anywhere. There’s also no guarantee that users would actually pay for the product I made.\n\nPersonally, unless I’m in a stable financial situation, I wouldn’t walk away from a job.",

Affiliate model with translation services - there is huge intent behind Spanglish searches, people actually want to communicate across languages\n\n2. Ad revenue on the translation queries - this is high-volume, low-intent traffic which works well for display ads\n\n3. Language learning angle - Spanglish users are often people trying to improve their English or Spanish, could upsell courses\n\nThe smart move might be validating one monetization angle quickly before handing it off. Set up Google AdSense for a week, see what CPM you get. Run one affiliate link test. That data makes the asset way more valuable to a buyer.\n\nWhat kind of traffic are you seeing right now even without any SEO work?\n\n",

The \"setup tax\" before hitting record is real.  \n  \nThe 700k/month search volume is wild though. That's way more demand than most indie projects start with. Even if you're not marketing it hard, SEO alone could get you some natural traction if the on-page stuff is optimized.  \n  \nWhat's the current traffic like?

How many are paying? Is this thing growing?\n\nIndie Panel fixes that. You connect your PostgreSQL databases (works with Neon, Supabase, or any standard Postgres) and immediately get a clean dashboard with:\n\n\\- Total users and paid user counts\n\n\\- Growth trends and daily snapshots\n\n\\- Charts that track your metrics over time\n\n\\- AES-256 encrypted database connections\n\nIt's one dashboard for all your projects, so you can stop context-switching between databases and focus on building.\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback! What metrics do you wish you had better visibility into across your projects? \n\n  \nP.S. I'm launching on ProductHunt, where you'll find a 30% off coupon!\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/indie-panel?launch=indie-panel](https://www.producthunt.com/products/indie-panel?launch=indie-panel)",

One time the backups didn't even exist. Recently tested a Postgres backup from Supabase — it was there but incomplete. Missing tables, truncated data.\n\nLooked for solutions: Veeam and Commvault do backup validation, but only inside their own ecosystem at enterprise pricing. Nothing vendor-agnostic for SMBs.\n\nSo I'm building it. The concept:\n→ Deploy a runner on your infra\n→ It restores your backup in an isolated container\n→ Runs verification (SQL queries, file checks, archive integrity)\n→ Signs the report cryptographically\n→ Destroys everything — zero data leaves your network\n\nDashboard for CTOs and auditors (ISO 27001 / SOC 2).\n\nSolo founder, Go + Vue.js, MVP nearly done. Landing page is live to gauge interest.\n\nhttps://restoreproof.io \n\nAnyone dealt with this problem? Would love to hear your take.",

No account limits. Which means I see an absurd amount of content go through our system.\n\nSome of it is bad. Like objectively bad. I’ll chalk some of that up to cultural differences and move on. Some of it is actually decent. Sometimes even looks human.\n\nI talk to our clients a lot because thats how you build partnerships and just asked around what they are doing and how. They understand that If I were to steal their busisnes I woudl did that already.\n\nRoughly:\n\n* \\~25% of the good stuff is written by actual humans\n* the rest is AI, but conditioned on the user\n* about half uses custom-trained models\n* the other half is just GPT behind a decent wrapper\n\nThe common thing for the GPT wrappers is that they all pass a brand voice file  at the start of each session.\n\nNot a “tone: friendly” prompt.  \nAn actual config that tells the model how the brand talks, what it avoids, how it structures things, what words are banned, etc.\n\nI asked a few clients how they do it, merged a couple of their setups, and cleaned it up so it’s reusable. You can pick what you want and delete the rest.\n\nHow to use it?  \nI’m not your mom. Play with it.\n\nIf you’re an agency, the obvious move is:  \ntalk to the client, steal their stories, weird phrases, strong opinions, dump that into the XML.

The fix that actually works is validation at generation time... run each output through a lightweight check against your banned list and structure rules before it hits the user, then re-generate on failure.

You can write 50 rules and the model will still drift, but give it 3-4 real samples of how you actually write and it picks up on rhythm and word choice way better than any rule can describe.\n\n  \nOne thing I'd add to this template though — negative examples specific to YOUR brand, not just generic AI slop. Like \"here's a draft I rejected and why\" next to the good ones. That contrast teaches the model more than banned words alone. Banned words catch the obvious tells but they won't fix the deeper problem of everything sounding like it came from the same slightly-too-polished voice.\n\n  \nAlso +1 to what pbalIII said about drift. Even with a perfect config, by message 4 or 5 the model starts echoing itself. We ended up just re-injecting the voice file every few messages instead of trusting the context window to hold it.",

When you write out explicit rules about what your brand sounds like, it becomes clear where your actual content drifts from your ideal voice.\n\n  \nA practical approach I've used - take your best performing posts or emails, paste them into Claude with a prompt like 'extract the patterns that make this sound like our brand' and let it identify the common threads. Then formalize those into the config.\n\n  \nThe banned words list is underrated. Removing 'delve' and 'tapestry' alone makes such a difference. Have you experimented with industry-specific banned words? For developer tools, banning phrases like 'revolutionary' or 'disrupt' has been more impactful than I expected.\n\n",

Scheduling tools solve the \"when\" but still require you to go open another app, which is where the friction actually is.\n\nCurious: do you also use it to figure out WHERE to post? That's the other half I've been thinking about a lot. I built [beampost.app](http://beampost.app) to help find the right communities for a product, but the posting/scheduling part is still manual. Your approach + something like that could be a pretty solid combo.\n\nHow's the PostFast API to work with?

      "text": "You want the privacy and unlimited runs of self-hosting your automations, but the usual setup feels like signing up for extra chores: spinning up Postgres, configuring Redis, writing a compose file that might break on the next pull, tweaking secrets... it's exhausting when all you need is a quick drag-and-drop flow for Sheet updates or Slack alerts.\n\nFor the everyday stuff that should \"just work\" privately on your machine or VPS, I wanted zero excuses.\n\nSo I put together a dead-simple way to run the same engine that powers **a2n.io** locally via Docker.  \n\nRepo with full steps/docs: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio  \n\n(The repo is your guide to pulling and running the pre-built image – not source code.)\n\n**One single step to deploy and run:**\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nThat's literally it.  \n\nDocker pulls the image, starts the container, maps the port, and persists your data in a volume.  \n\nOpen http://localhost:8080 (or your server's IP:8080), set up your admin account, and you're building workflows in under a minute.\n\nEverything embedded by default (Postgres + Redis included) – no extra services or config for testing/dev/small use.  \n\nFor production scale, add your own DATABASE\\_URL and REDIS\\_URL env vars later (still straightforward).\n\nWhat lands ready to use:\n\n\\- Drag-and-drop visual builder (nodes, connections – familiar feel)\n\n\\- 30+ integrations: Google Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok, webhooks, schedules, HTTP/SQL, code nodes (JS/Python), AI agents with real tool calling/reasoning\n\n\\- Real-time execution monitoring and logs – no more guessing why something failed\n\n\\- No forced white-label or branding – your instance looks and feels like yours\n\n\\- Unlimited workflows and executions (hosted free tier has limits, self-run doesn't)\n\nTrade-offs to keep it real:\n\n\\- Node count is focused on practical everyday hits (growing, but not n8n's thousands yet)\n\n\\- Heavy custom scripting is lighter here\n\n\\- For exposed/high-traffic setups, add a reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) for HTTPS + security\n\n\\- It's a newer setup – community small, so feedback helps shape it\n\nI've been running it on my local machine and a low-end VPS for notification bots and AI summaries – deploys fast, no drama, data stays locked down.\n\nIf self-host setup pain has kept you from running more private automations, try that one command. Takes seconds to test.\n\nWhat usually stops you from self-hosting workflow tools? The dependency pile-up, security worries, missing nodes, or just the time sink? Real answers appreciated – this is built to cut exactly those barriers. 🚀",

Influencer marketing hit $24B in 2025, but it's getting saturated. Meanwhile, 86% of consumers say brands are most trustworthy when they co-create with customers.\n\n(I’m not saying these ‘4’ types are dead, no, just the MOAT is evolving)\n\nAnd companies that personalize through co-creation see 40% more revenue growth than competitors.\n\nLEGO proved this at scale. They let fans submit and vote on product ideas. Result: 2.8 million community members, 135,000+ ideas submitted, and a $90M business line with 40% profit margins. It incentive:\n\n* cross-selling among satisfied users\n* free user acquisition\n* constant feedback\n\nNow here's what's changed: with AI, anyone can build anything. Products are a commodity. The only real moat is your audience. And the strongest audiences aren't followers. They're these active users.\n\n**So how do you actually do this?**\n\nStep 1: Own your audience through email. Not social. Not algorithms (example : a newsletter you control or just gathering email with your project)\n\nStep 2: Feature the people who engage. Interview them. Showcase them. Make them the content. Any original idea is welcomed.\n\nStep 3: Build the product that matches the value you're already giving.\n\nI'm running this with two projects right now:\n\n[StartupHunt.io](http://StartupHunt.io) that started as a newsletter. I feature founders who reply to my emails. I interview them, spotlight their projects. Now I'm building a product on top that matches the value I already bring them (not live but the principle is here)\n\n[TrustViews.io](http://TrustViews.io)**, a** directory ranking people by views. I'm launching a newsletter where I break down the strategies behind each person's traffic curve from listed people. The directory feeds the newsletter. The newsletter feeds the directory.\n\nThe framework in 3 words: **feature your users.**\n\nHave reviews? Showcase them in the newsletter.\n\nHave top performers? Interview them.\n\nHave case studies? Tell their stories.\n\nWhen your users ARE the content, you don't have a distribution problem. They share because they're in it. That’s today’s MOAT.",

Still easy.)\n\nWhat you get right away:\n\n\\- Familiar drag-and-drop canvas (nodes, connections, like n8n but lighter)\n\n\\- 30+ practical nodes: Webhook/Schedule triggers, Google Sheets/Slack/Notion/Telegram/Gmail/Discord/GitHub/Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok + built-in AI agents with real tool calling\n\n\\- JS/Python code nodes, HTTP/SQL, filters, loops, file handling\n\n\\- Real-time execution logs and monitoring — see exactly what's happening\n\n\\- Unlimited workflows/executions when self-hosted (no caps)\n\n\\- Data stays 100% on your machine/VPS — perfect for sensitive stuff\n\nIt's not trying to match n8n's 1000+ node ecosystem yet (growing, focused on 80/20 hits), and heavy custom scripting is lighter here. But for the flows most people actually build and run daily? This deploys fast, stays stable, and doesn't make you dread updates.\n\nI've got mine running on a cheap VPS for notification bots and AI summaries — one pull and it's up, no drama.\n\nIf you've been waiting for a self-hosted workflow tool that doesn't punish you for wanting privacy and simplicity, try that one command. Takes 30 seconds.\n\nWhat usually kills self-hosting for you — the multi-container setup, worrying about dependencies, or missing key integrations? Drop it below — this is built to fix exactly those pains. 🚀",

Instead of marketing it, I used it internally to generate **all App Store screenshots and metadata** for another app of mine, **VideAI**.\n\nHere’s the important part:  \nAsogenie doesn’t just “generate text or images.”\n\nIt takes:\n\n* **Raw App Store screenshots**\n* **Country-specific keywords I select**\n\nAnd then generates:\n\n* **ASO-optimized metadata per country**\n* **Localized screenshots adapted to each country’s language**\n* Copy and visuals aligned with local App Store behavior\n\nNo ads.  \nNo social posts.  \nNo influencer marketing.\n\nJust country-based ASO assets generated with Asogenie.\n\nAfter 30 days, VideAI made **$1,100+**.\n\nA lot of people say *“ASO is dead”*.\n\nI’m not claiming this is massive revenue — but this felt like solid proof that **ASO still works**, especially when it’s:\n\n* country-aware\n* keyword-driven\n* adapted to local language & intent\n\nNow I’m trying to figure out how to position Asogenie itself.\n\nIf you’re building apps:\n\n* Would a tool focused purely on **country-level ASO generation** be valuable?\n* What would make you actually pay for something like this?\n\n**If you’re interested, here’s the App Store link:** [Asogenie](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/asogenie-ai-ekran-g%C3%B6r%C3%BCnt%C3%BCs%C3%BC/id6757458571)\n\nYou can try it for free.  \n*Quick note:* until the latest update is approved, please make sure to tap the **English** button in the country selector when testing — otherwise generation won’t start. This is already fixed and waiting for App Store review.\n\nI’d really appreciate any **honest feedback**.\n\nThanks 🙏",
