It's just HTML.\"\n* \"Security Theater — We put a lock icon next to the URL bar. That means we're SOC-2 compliant, right? (Don't check).\"\n\nLogo strip: \"TRUSTED BY COMPANIES WHO IGNORED OUR RED FLAGS\" — Scripe, Airbnble, Verchell, Curved, Raycrash\n\nThe pricing tier names are \"Decoy Tier,\" \"VC Trap,\" and \"Enterprise.\"\n\nNo product.

In general, traction is driven by a real need and genuine interest in a service; only a small group of people tend to have that early-stage, support-oriented mindset.\n\nThat said, I hope your experiment succeeds.

      "text": "Hi everyone,  \nI’m writing this mostly to vent, but also to ask for honest feedback.\n\nA few months ago, I decided to go solo and try entrepreneurship again.  \nI spent more than 9 years climbing the technical ladder (full-stack dev, senior, lead, head of engineering, CTO). I’ve seen startups from the inside: how they grow, how they break, how people burn out (including myself).\n\nI thought that experience would count for something.\n\nMy first big mistake:  \nI believed the internet rewards experience, honesty, and good intentions.\n\nI’ve asked for feedback hundreds of times.\n\nI can count the real responses I got on one hand and still have fingers left.\n\nI gave away my experience for free.  \nI built an open-source library. The reactions? Mostly criticism:  \n“this already exists”, “why reinvent the wheel”, “this is useless”.\n\nI even open-sourced the landing page of a project that won a CSS Winner Star.  \nInstead of curiosity, I got mockery:  \n“How did this even win?”, “they give awards to anyone now”.\n\nThat hurt more than I expected.\n\nMy second mistake was validation.  \nI honestly thought validation meant people saying:  \n“Wow, great idea”, “cool product”, “nice angle”.\n\nNow I understand that’s just noise.  \nValidation is when someone actually pays and nobody did.\n\nAnother lesson: words matter more than logic.  \nI started using terms like “growth” and “engagement”, until a few people helped me realize those words trigger distrust and scam vibes for many.\n\nWhat I’m still struggling to understand is this:\n\nWhy does it feel like I only get extremes?  \nEither **silence**… or **rejection**.  \nEither **no response at all**… or **negativity**.\n\nI don’t think I’m entitled to success.  \nBut I genuinely want to understand:\n\n**What am I doing wrong?**  \n**How do you find the** ***right*** **people instead of shouting into the void?**\n\nIf you’ve been there, I’d really appreciate your perspective.\n\n",

Most public spaces online aren’t built for thoughtful feedback, they’re built for fast reactions, and negativity is easier than curiosity.\n\nThe silence or rejection pattern is really common when you’re sharing things broadly without a very specific audience. Most people ignore what doesn’t speak directly to their problem, and the few who engage often do so defensively. That’s not a reflection of your experience or the quality of your work.\n\nA lot of builders hit this stage before things start to click.",

So, just have a vision firstly,of what you want to do, have conviction of where you want to go with your product and then parse serious constructive criticism from thoughtless, envious, pull you down, don’t care trash. Know in your heart that if other people can achieve their goals, you can too. There’s no difference. Lastly, focus on helping the people you were meant to help. Financial rewards will follow. Oh, and being sensitive is a good thing but not re the internet. It’s too big and broad. Narrow down what you’re asking. Forget comments like ‘this is crap’. That doesn’t mean anything. It’s not specific and it pulls down without a solution to how something could be improved. Anybody can do that. What’s the other comment? Oh yeah , it’s been done before. Really? So, there’s only one make of TV? Or only one song? Or only one make of car?  Of course it’s been done before. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel just do it in your own unique way for the people you are trying to attract. That’s competition. And btw there’s more than enough for everyone to have more than enough and there’ll be more than enough left over. That’s my 2 cents. Hope it helps.",

The people who comment publicly are often those with the least to lose by being critical - they're procrastinating, venting, or just looking to feel smart.\n\nFor open source specifically, the \"this already exists\" crowd is loud but irrelevant. Every useful project started as a \"reinvention\" of something. The question isn't whether alternatives exist, it's whether yours solves a specific problem better for specific people.\n\nOn finding the right people: stop broadcasting to forums and start having conversations with individuals. DM 10 people who've complained about the exact problem you're solving. Most won't reply, but the 2-3 who do will give you more signal than 100 Reddit comments.\n\nYour validation lesson is spot on though. Compliments cost nothing. Payments reveal truth.",

It's literally the wild west, people want you off their property, you're that sleezy salesman guy that nobody wants to interact with.\n\nI was introverted and personally also thought these salesmen are the worst, until I become one.

We learned this tactic called feature vs benefits. \"My app has XYZ features, e.g. AI implementation\" when it should have been \"You'll be able to spend more time with your kids now\". \n\nJust seeing how you write your post, I can't help but noticed you wrote \"I\" like a bijillion times. The goal we are all working towards should be that our products will provide value to people. It's not the \"I thought the internet rewards experience, honesty, and good intentions. but I was wrong\" it's \"why can't I convey myself more authentically and genuinely \".

If you're going to be on someone's property who obviously knows you're there to sleezy salesman them, even offering something free will cause suspicion. They won't think \"wow he's being nice\". Their guard is already up, most of the internet already is like that.\n\nI mentioned those guys in the office who constantly kept making sales, we sold the same product with the same features but yet they made so much more. I spoke with them and learnt a lot which helped me get better. I thought they would be pushy, sleezy and cunning but those guys were the complete opposite. They were incredibly likeable.\n\nSorry to spew what I was taught, but basically how you write your post is more important than what you're posting/offering. Someone could take the same ideas from your post, reword it, (with understanding the context of the audience they are posting to), and be able to sound completely different to you. I wholehearted can guarantee this is fact.\n\nHow is that possible? Its not so simple, one way is he becomes a valuable member of that community first, then people trust what he's saying. Whenever I made a sale, the chances of me closing his neighbour was higher because if I sold to John, the chances his neighbour would trust me would go up. Life works in the same way, and so does the internet. Sorry again, this doesn't give an exact to-do but I hope you can view it with a different perspective at least.",

You can turn those logs into structured reports on usage metrics to see where free users are, or aren't spending their time. This gives you 2 more options than you have now. 1, make sure the pages getting attention keep it, there's stuff working there. The pages that aren't will get deep assessments of why. 2, you have users who may not even notice a feature, create a login pop-up that brings the unused features up so they know it exists and how to use it. Make this an opt in thing where the DB logs the user response so they're not flagged on every log in.\n\nYou can't do anything on my project without me knowing, generally speaking. I log everything, but that's part of my security and compliance posture, and it's all spelled out in ToS and Privacy Policy.\n\nAdd a request feature form that can voted on publicly, after you review it. Then advertise you're doing that on your pages. Maybe you start to get some hits on why pages aren't working from that. Do the same with a bug report, have it capture appropriate details automatically from the page for debugging. Maybe you don't know a feature is buggy, people will gladly tell you.",

It just didn't stack up.  \n\nOrganic SEO on the other hand has been the engine that has driven all of our growth for past 5 years.  People searching for the phases we target are already warm and conversion rates are about 6% (new users landing to paid subscribers).  In contrast Ads never went above 1%.\n\nThat said, things have shifted since September last year, that is impacting organic  and causing us headaches.  We have been seeing a steady decline in traffic volumes, especially from google (down about 40%).  In google search console our impressions are growing, our average position is staying level, but our clicks are declining rapidly.  I can only think that this is because of the AI overviews and search users relying more and more on those.  That is making the Organic SEO even more competitive!  Rather than having to get in to the top 5 on google, now you have to be in the top 1 as that seems to be all the AI search results seem to be including in their responses.  \n\nTimes are a changing!",

What winners have in common\n\nAcross categories, the successful ones share:\n\n* A very specific “do this one job” promise in the tagline. (in the tagline)\n* Clear audience and use case you can understand in three seconds. (in the tagline, if not description)\n* Their categories reinforce the positioning instead of trying to cover everything (max 3)\n\nIf you want more breakdowns like this, that is exactly what the newsletter goes into each week, using fresh data from startuphunt.io.​\n\n3. What the failed ones share\n\nThe low‑traction launches also share patterns, just in the opposite direction.​\n\n* Vague promises like “platform”, “solution”, or “experience” without accuracy.\n* Taglines that describe features or tech, not the outcome for a real person.​\n* Numerous categories...\n\nMany of them are not bad ideas, they are just impossible to “get” fast enough for someone scrolling past.​\n\nIf this kind of data‑driven teardown helps, this post is part of a newsletter series powered by [startuphunt.io](http://startuphunt.io), where more datasets and patterns are shared for founders.​",

The \"do this one job\" angle is so true. People are scrolling fast, if they can't understand what you're offering in 3 seconds, they're gone. One thing I'd add - even the best tagline won't convert if your landing page looks sketch or takes forever to load. First impressions are everything. I help indie hackers build clean, fast websites with Framer that match the quality of their product. If anyone's launching soon and wants their online presence to not suck, hit me up.

Ignore the noise. Some people criticize just to feel smart. That’s not signal.\n2. Build smaller circles instead of shouting into the void. This thread proved that real conversations still exist.\n3. Validation is not “this is a great product”. Validation is **“I’m paying for this.”**\n4. Focus on benefits, not features. Nobody buys features.\n\nAnd today something small but important happened:  \n**my first user entered their card.**  \nIt’s just one person, but it feels more real than a thousand compliments.\n\nSo today, I’m shipping.  \nI’m launching **KironX** on Product Hunt with a much clearer mentality: listen, validate, repeat.\n\nIf anyone here feels like checking it out or supporting, I’d really appreciate it.  \nI’ll share the Product Hunt link in the comments.\n\nThanks again to everyone who took the time to reply to my previous post.  \nThis community genuinely helped me move forward.\n\nTime to face the world.",

The noise there is unreal.\n\nSome new launches had 60–70 upvotes within minutes, which honestly felt off. My launch dropped past position 50 almost immediately, so it wasn't even visible anymore. At that point, it feels less like discovery and more like a popularity/farming game.\n\nWhat I did take away though aligns a lot with what you said:\n- One real user > hundreds of anonymous upvotes  \n- Conversations and feedback matter way more than leaderboard position  \n- PH can help, but it's not the signal people think it is - especially early on\n\nSo yeah, even if PH didn't work out for me, shipping still mattered. Learning still mattered.

I've always built things that I wanted and hoped that other people would as well, and so far it has worked out. I'm trying to do things differently this time:  \n1. Validate first or at least early in the process  \n2. Focus on marketing/distribution. I used to believe that just making a great product was enough. I thought it would speak for itself, but in this crowded world, if you don't help people find it, it's like it doesn't even exist.\n\nDo you have any hard-won advice on how to validate?

      "text": "When I launched my directory, I made the classic mistake.\n\nI thought: “If the product is useful, people will just show up.”\n\nThey… did at my scale but it paid me $0.\n\nDirectories look simple from the outside.\n\n* Visibility (Traffic)\n* Backlinks (SEO)\n* Social proof via scores and rankings\n\nI started by ranking sites by their monthly views, inspired by [trustmrr.com](http://trustmrr.com), but about views/traffic : [trustviews.io](http://trustviews.io) (yes I copied it)\n\nThe first idea: charge for detailed analytics.\n\nOn paper, it made sense.\n\nIn practice, it failed.\n\nAnalytics only get valuable when you you go in details and are cheap. I was cheap but not detailed.\n\nSo I shifted.\n\nInstead of selling analytics, I turned Trustviews into a “classical” directory business model with ad slots on the side.\n\nZero meaningful clicks.\n\nSo for now, I’ve filled most of the space with affiliate links, and I’m leaving 3 out of 10 slots open.\n\nThose will be for actual sponsors later, when the traffic justifies it.\n\nThen, I talked to someone running multiple successful directories and making money out of it.\n\nHe told me everything I was doing wrong. So I’ll turn my directory into something I did not truly understood at first : paid listing.\n\nTo me it’s just slowing down growth, as less people would come in. But here is the trick :\n\n* If you want a dofollow backlink, you pay. (= I earn money & you win SEO & visibility)\n* If you don’t want to pay, you can still get listed, but you install the badge on your landing page to get that dofollow backlink. (= I earn SEO & you get visibility).\n\nThat one idea changed how I think about directories. Because indeed it’s all about what everyone get and it’s quite healthy if you ask me.\n\nThis is the other lesson:\n\nMost monetization ideas only work once you have real traction.\n\nUntil then, they’re just decoration.\n\nTo make Trustviews actually unique, I’m leaning into something different.\n\nA weekly newsletter.\n\nNot a “here are 10 tools” list.\n\nMore like:\n\n* How these projects get consistent views\n* Why traffic spikes happen\n* What strategies caused them\n* Interviews with founders behind the listings\n\nThe goal is to make the directory feel alive.\n\nNot just a wall of logos, but a community and a learning engine.\n\nIf I do this right, Trustviews becomes more than a place to dump your link.\n\nIt becomes a place where:\n\n* You understand how people actually got attention\n* Your project gets ongoing visibility, not a one-time launch\n* Readers learn distribution by watching real examples\n\nA few lessons from this whole experiment so far:\n\n1. A directory without a clear edge is just another list.\n2. Monetization has to line up with what founders actually value: backlinks, traffic, and proof they can show.\n3. Turning a directory into a media product newsletter, interviews, insights might be the real moat.\n\nThis is all still in motion.\n\nI’m earning nothing, but learning a lot, and adjusting as I go.\n\nNone of this is theory.\n\nIt’s just what I’ve tried, what failed (no actual fail), and what seems to be working.\n\nIf you run a directory, buy listings, or have ideas on better models, I’d love to hear them.\n\nReply and tell me what you’ve seen work.",

To put all my bets in newsletter before I actually see any signal of it working. \nWhat I wouldn’t do: if you see people are even signing up to the newsletter, track link clicks and time on page for the newsletter click. If you see some people who are actually clicking more than once in a defined time period, try to understand who they are and double down on that type of user. They might be just the segment that will join a community.\n\nMind also that retention problems usually are engagement problems - this leads to habit formation loops. If you see people joining but not engaging, check that.\n\nBottomline, I guess you need to state well what kind of product and business problem you are trying to solve.

Most founders obsess over feature churn when payment recovery is lower-hanging fruit.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Beta strategy suggestions:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Get testimonials fast\\*\\*: Since it's free now, make getting case studies/testimonials a priority. \"Recovered $X in failed payments in 48 hours\" is powerful social proof for when you launch paid tiers.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Data collection\\*\\*: Track recovery rates by industry, payment method, timing. This data becomes your moat and helps you price intelligently later.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Find your pricing sweet spot\\*\\*: Don't go from free to $2,500/user. Consider:\n\n   \\- Usage-based: % of recovered revenue (e.g., 10-15%)\n\n   \\- Flat monthly: $49-99/month for <1000 customers\n\n   \\- You only win when they win = easier sell\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Technical considerations:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- How are you handling email deliverability? That's often the hidden complexity\n\n\\- Are you doing dunning sequences or just one-off emails?\n\n\\- What about webhook reliability from Stripe?\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Competitive advantage:\\*\\*\n\nYour simplicity IS the feature. Gainsight/ChurnZero are bloated because they try to solve everything. Stay focused on payment recovery - do one thing exceptionally well.\n\n\n\nCurious: what's your tech stack?

      "text": "Hello everyone! I am Jst Tan, currently taking a few gap months until college, and looking to make something meaningful in life, as well as make some money for college. \n\nI noticed that vibe coding is very popular at the moment. Why wouldn't it? People with non-technical skills or people with technical skills can sit back, prompt and get a website quickly and with low cost, since they do not need to hire a developer. Personally, I used it myself frequently too. \n\nHowever, many people here know that vibe coding has many disadvantages, from security vulnerabilities, a ton of bugs, AI hallucinating and much more. These can be very troublesome when they are deployed. However, although this is AI fault, it is also caused by the lack of constraints set by us. \n\n  \nWhich is why I am thinking of building a project/product where there will be: \n\n* Agent Rules \n* Agent Skills \n* AI Agents (sub-agent)\n* Website starter kit (authentication, payment, newsletter, database, analytics, premium UI components, to avoid AI creating hallucinating code) \n* Security checklist \n* Launch checklist \n* Affiliate program list \n* Website builder agent \n* Terms of Services & Privacy Policy agent \n* MCP list to enhance the AI\n\nWith all of these, we can create constraints onto AI, and enforce it to create a ready to launch website quickly without too much worries, while ensuring that AI can produce better codes together.  \n  \nI am currently considering in whether I should make this into a premium paid offering or offer it open source. I would love the opinion of the community. For those who recommended open source, I would love to hear your thoughts on how I can make a little money for college.   \n  \nI am not looking to sell or anything, just planning everything out, and I believe that with community feedback, I can make a better decision and shape a better product. Love to hear the opinion of everyone here. ",

But the list of features you mentioned is massive. Authentication, payments, UI components, legal docs, security checklists, affiliate programs... that's a lot of scope for a gap-year project.\n\nMy suggestion: pick one thing and nail it. What's the single most painful part of going from \"vibe coded prototype\" to \"actually deployed product\"? Start there. You can always expand later.\n\nOn open source vs paid: you could do both. Open source the core (builds trust, gets adoption), charge for hosted version or premium templates. Lots of indie hackers do this successfully.\n\nOne more thing: before building, talk to 10-15 people who vibe code regularly. Ask them what actually breaks for them. You might find the biggest pain point isn't what you expect.\n\nGood luck with it and props for building instead of just consuming during your gap months.",
