      "text": "I hit 60+ paid customers for my [SaaS](https://depost.ai/) in about 90 days.\n\nNot a “woke up to 5,000 signups” thing. More like steady accumulation from a few channels that compound if you show up daily.\n\nI’m posting this because when I started, I kept searching for *the* channel. Turns out it was the boring combo of 4–5 things done consistently.\n\n**1) SEO still works (but only if you write for problems, not keywords)**\n\nWhat worked for me wasn’t “10 blogs a week.” It was a small set of pages that match buying intent.\n\nA few strategies that moved the needle:\n\n* **Problem-first posts:** “how to do X without Y” where X is the job-to-be-done your product helps with.\n* **Comparison pages:** “Tool A vs Tool B for \\[use case\\]” (people search this when they’re close to buying).\n* **Alternatives pages:** “best alternatives to X” (again, very high intent).\n* **Integration/workflow pages:** “How to \\[workflow\\] with \\[platform\\]” if your product plugs into a real workflow.\n* **Refresh, don’t spam:** updating 5 posts that already rank beat publishing 50 new ones for me.\n\nSEO wasn’t explosive, but it is the one channel that keeps giving even when you’re busy.\n\n**2) Reddit: be present, not promotional**\n\nReddit was huge, but only when I treated it like community, not distribution.\n\nMy rule: I only reply where I can add something genuinely useful.\n\n* Find threads where people are already asking for help (pain is explicit).\n* Reply with specifics: steps, examples, what I tried, what failed.\n* If my product fits, I mention it **once at the end** as an option, not the whole point of the reply.\n* I don’t drop links unless someone asks (filters + downvotes are real).\n\nThis channel brought some of the best users because the context is already “I have a problem.”\n\n**3) LinkedIn: the**  [workflow](https://far-bunny-4e1.notion.site/The-7-Step-LinkedIn-Growth-Lead-Nurturing-System-2aa023c5601a80d69508c2a14ab7b1c9) **mattered more than posting**\n\nI used to think posting more = more customers.\n\nWhat actually worked was a small daily routine:\n\n* targeted engagement (I focus on a shortlist, not the main feed)\n* thoughtful comments\n* DMs only after some signal (reply/like/repeated interaction)\n* follow-ups tracked like a pipeline (most conversions came after the 2nd or 3rd touch)\n\nPosting helped, but the daily relationship-building loop helped more.\n\n**4) Personal onboarding: I personally contacted “worthy” signups**\n\nThis sounds obvious, but it changed retention and conversions.\n\nIf someone looked like a real fit, I’d message personally (email or LinkedIn):  \n“Hey, what are you trying to do with it? Want a quick walkthrough?”\n\nThose short convos did three things:\n\n* reduced churn (people churn when they’re confused)\n* gave me copy/positioning insight\n* turned some trials into paid faster\n\n**5) Partnerships: small influencer deals beat “big launch energy”**\n\nI partnered with a few creators who have the right audience.  \nSome were paid, some got free access and posted twice a month.\n\nThis wasn’t magic either, but it was consistent traffic + trust transfer, which is hard to buy elsewhere.\n\n**What I’m doubling down on next**\n\nSEO + Reddit presence + the LinkedIn workflow + personal onboarding.\n\nIt’s not glamorous, but it’s the first time growth has felt repeatable for me.\n\nCurious: if you had to pick **one** channel to double down on for the next 90 days, which would it be and why?\n\nHere is my LinkedIn [workflow](https://far-bunny-4e1.notion.site/The-7-Step-LinkedIn-Growth-Lead-Nurturing-System-2aa023c5601a80d69508c2a14ab7b1c9), which I run daily to book demos...",

SEO = buying intent, Reddit = explicit pain, LinkedIn = relationship signal, onboarding = confusion removal, partnerships = trust borrowing.\n\nI’ve seen teams do the opposite (optimize channels, not intent) and then wonder why nothing compounds.",

Log every convo in a simple sheet: subreddit, problem, what you answered, whether they engaged, and whether you nudged them to a landing page or trial. Treat comments → DMs → demos like stages.\nTools like F5bot or Mailbrew plus something like GummySearch help with keyword discovery; Pulse just helps keep replies from sounding spammy and makes it easier to scale without burning hours.",

Aye Chat is intentionally CLI-first and stays close to the traditional terminal experience.  \n  \nAlso, the main difference from other similar tools like Claude Code or GitHub Copilot is the workflow: instead of asking permission to apply changes that AI generates, it writes to files automatically but provides a way to immediately undo those changes. This tends to work well for experiments and prototyping.",

They produce offspring or kill each other either for fun or ressources. They build factions and their own structures. You can’t control any of that just observe and hand them the tools. \n\nThe game is a whooping 750KB file that basically lives and breathes your CPU as if it finally can express itself. \n\nTry it and let me know what you think!",

I built things that were too complicated, based on \"stupid\" unique ideas, or had zero plan for distribution. I thought the product had to be revolutionary to work.\n\nThen I launched my last two projects. They were simpler. They weren't trying to change the world, just solve a problem. And guess what? They’re the only ones that actually made money and are growing right now.\n\nThat’s when it clicked.\n\nI spend hours every day looking at new startups, and I’m honestly shocked at what I see. People are building incredibly simple tools—stuff you could clone in a weekend with AI—and making real money because they nailed the audience, not the code.\n\nSo I’m pivoting.\n\nI’m launching Startup Hunt, a weekly deep dive where I break down these simple, money-making products and exactly how they’re getting users. No fluff, just the \"boring\" stuff that actually pays the bills.\n\nI’m sending the very first issue this Monday. It’s fully free, and I’m just excited to share what I’m finding.\n\nCheck it out here:  \n[startuphunt.io](https://startuphunt.io/)",

Simple products force you to be sharp on positioning and distribution, which is uncomfortable but effective.\n\nOne thing I’m curious about: when you analyze these “simple but profitable” tools, do you usually see founders validating demand *before* building, or are they mostly iterating fast after launch based on early traction?",

I tried to find out how to fix the days but got tired of trying bc I couldn’t figure it out. \n\nAlso when i subscribed… it took arbout 5-10 mins to register that I paid for a membership”\n\nOuch, felt the user’s pain point immediately and  was embarrassed about the app. I explained how to use the app, but ultimately linked them to apples refund page as I wasn’t going to try and trick them out of their money.\n\nI then followed up when they got their refund and gave them 3 months free. No reply, not been active since. Bummer\n\nBut I got some extremely useful feedback! I improved the onboarding flow to show how dates could be added to workouts and opened a ticket to investigate the delayed membership result on their account\n\nSo always reach out immediately I caught this guy when he was still frustrated enough to give me his opinion\n\nFor any wondering my app is: https://www.gymnoteplus.com",

And then follow up again a few days later asking for feedback again. That way you can build the relationship and open the line of communication with them. \n\nWe do this at Dreamlit and it's fantastic for getting feedback / meetings on the cal with customers.

Even if the user never came back, that kind of response compounds long-term trust and reputation — and the onboarding + billing fixes you made probably paid for themselves already.\n\nEarly churn feedback hurts, but it’s some of the highest ROI work you can do.",

It works like a public leaderboard of startups and directories, but only with real, validated views that update live.\n\nNo edited screenshots, no made‑up metrics. The numbers on each public page come from the same script (or GA4) that powers the site’s own analytics, so what you see is what actually happened.\n\nThe main reason this exists is that founders constantly struggle with proof: some oversell their traction with nice‑looking dashboards, while others undersell it because they have no simple, credible way to showcase their real traffic. (I did)\n\nMy dream long term is to have blogs and directories listed there, since **views** are literally their business model, and hosting those numbers on a neutral third‑party page would be insanely OP for transparency and trust with their users.\n\nWould love ideas on things like:  \n– Should there be space for founder notes or context around spikes and dips?  \n– As a founder, would you feel comfortable linking to a public traffic page from your landing, newsletter, or launch post?\n\nOpen to any feedback.

Would you personally pay for something like this?\n2. What would make it worth paying for vs not?\n3. If you wouldn’t pay, what’s the main reason?\n\nNot launching or selling anything, just validating whether this solves a real enough problem before building.\n\nThanks for the honest feedback 🙏\n\n",

As someone who's explored various platforms for finding opportunities, I think the key value would be in the filtering accuracy and speed of notifications.\n\n\n\nFor your questions:\n\n1. I'd consider paying if it consistently saved me 30+ minutes daily and led to quality job matches\n\n2. Worth paying if the conversion rate from alert to actual gig is notably higher than manual searching\n\n3. Main hesitation would be whether the filters can truly capture nuanced requirements vs just keyword matching\n\n\n\nOne suggestion: maybe offer a free tier with basic filters to let people test the accuracy before committing? Good luck with validation!",

      "text": "**Note: FOCUS is mobile apps not web.**\n\nMy post about finding an exposed OpenAI key got a lot of responses asking \"okay but how do I actually fix this?\"\n\nHere's the simplest setup that works.\n\n**The problem:** Your app needs to call OpenAI. If you put the API key in your app code, anyone can extract it. Doesn't matter if it's in .env files or environment variables. Once it's in the bundle, it's public.\n\n**The fix:** Your app calls YOUR server. Your server calls OpenAI. The key never leaves your server.\n\n    App → Your Backend → OpenAI\n            (key lives here)\n\n**What you need:**\n\n1. A cheap VPS (Hetzner €3.29/month, DigitalOcean $4/month, or free tier from Railway/Render)\n2. A simple proxy that forwards requests\n\n**The code (Go, \\~50 lines):**\n\n    func proxyOpenAI(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        // Your key stays on the server\n        apiKey := os.Getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n        \n        // Forward the request to OpenAI\n        req, _ := http.NewRequest(r.Method, \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\", r.Body)\n        req.Header.Set(\"Authorization\", \"Bearer \"+apiKey)\n        req.Header.Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n        \n        resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)\n        if err != nil {\n            http.Error(w, \"API error\", 500)\n            return\n        }\n        defer resp.Body.Close()\n        \n        // Return response to your app\n        w.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n        io.Copy(w, resp.Body)\n    }\n\n**Your app calls:**\n\n    fetch('https://your-server.com/api/chat', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + userToken },\n      body: JSON.stringify({ \n        app_id: 'my-fitness-app',  // identifies your app\n        message: userInput \n      })\n    })\n\n**Add basic auth so random people can't use your proxy:**\n\nYour app authenticates users (Supabase, Firebase, whatever). Your backend verifies that token before proxying. Now only your logged-in users can make requests.\n\n**Scaling to multiple apps:**\n\nI run one backend that serves multiple apps. Each app gets its own isolated SQLite database based on the app\\_id:\n\n    /data/\n    ├── noteapp/\n    │   └── cache.db\n    ├── fitness-app/\n    │   └── cache.db\n    └── recipe-app/\n        └── cache.db\n\nThe backend routes requests to the right database:\n\n    func getDB(appID string) (*DB, error) {\n        dbPath := fmt.Sprintf(\"./data/%s/cache.db\", appID)\n        return sql.Open(\"sqlite3\", dbPath)\n    }\n\nOne server. Multiple apps. Complete data isolation. If one app has a bug, it can't touch another app's data.\n\n**Cost:** I run this on a €3.29/month Hetzner VPS. Uses 10% CPU, under 500MB RAM. Handles 10-15 apps easily.\n\n**If you don't want to manage a server:**\n\n* Vercel Edge Functions (free tier)\n* Supabase Edge Functions (free tier)\n* Cloudflare Workers (free tier)\n\nAll let you store secrets as environment variables on their platform.\n\n**The point:**\n\nYour app should never know the real API key. It only knows how to talk to your backend. Your backend handles the secret.\n\n2 hours of setup. Saves you from a $XXXX OpenAI bill because someone found your key.",
