We're talking thousands of dollars before they even notice.\n\nThis is the hidden cost of shipping fast without understanding the basics.\n\nSimple rule: your app should never hold secrets. API keys, database credentials, anything sensitive - keep it on your backend. App talks to your server, server talks to OpenAI.\n\nYou're not saving time by skipping this. You're gambling your runway on nobody looking.\n\nShip fast, but don't ship broke.",

Identify dead or legacy code from past implementations that are no longer needed, opportunities to make the code more DRY and maintainable, and identify code smell and bad patterns. Identify areas where code can be made more deterministic. Identify security risks. Make a plan to address these issues, ranked by order of importance with risk and value assessments for each item. Do not implement anything until I have manually reviewed.\"\n\nThis technique has let me push large code bases pretty far and has caught some stupid mistakes I've made before I push anything live. Sometimes I'll note that I'm building an MVP and can be more lax in certain areas, other times I ask for a production ready review.\n\nDo y'all do something similar?",

      "text": "Solo indie hacker building workflow automation tool. Started with $1600 savings and zero budget for advertising. Had to figure out customer acquisition through purely organic channels. Five months later at $5400 monthly recurring revenue with 92% from organic search.​ The indie hacker constraint of no ad budget forced focusing entirely on organic from day one. Strategy was building SEO foundation that compounds over time rather than paid ads that stop when money runs out. Everyone said SEO takes forever but I needed sustainable acquisition without burning limited savings.​ \n\nMonth one was pure foundation with zero revenue. Submitted site to 200+ directories through [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org) saving me 12+ hours of manual work I needed for product. Got listed on Product Hunt, Indie Hackers showcase, BetaList, every startup directory. Set up Search Console, researched 35 keywords. Published 4 posts. Hours invested: 45.​ Month two focused on content with DA climbing to 13. Published 3 posts weekly targeting longtail problem keywords. Created comparison pages even though product had gaps. Started appearing pages 3-4 in search results. Hours invested: 42. Revenue: $0.​ Month three showed first traction. Domain authority hit 19. Published 2 posts weekly plus updated 4 older posts. Got first organic signups. Hours invested: 38. Revenue: $780 MRR from 10 customers.​ Month four accelerated. Domain authority 24. Content from months 1-2 ranking page one. Published 2 posts weekly. Hours invested: 32. Revenue: $2340 MRR from 30 customers.​ Month five crossed $5K threshold. Domain authority 27. Ranking for 38 keywords. Getting 720 monthly organic visitors. Hours invested: 28. Revenue: $5400 MRR from 69 customers at $78 average monthly.​\n\nTotal investment over 5 months was minimal. Directory service $127 one-time, hosting $15 monthly, email tool $22 monthly, SEO tools $38 monthly. Total under $500 to reach $5400 MRR. The time investment totaled 185 hours over 5 months averaging 37 hours monthly dropping from 45 to 28 as efficiency improved.​ What worked for indie hackers was directory submissions for instant DA boost saving 12+ hours of manual work, publishing 2-3x weekly targeting problems not products, creating comparison content that converts searchers, optimizing conversion hard since traffic was limited, asking happy customers for testimonials, and being patient through first 60 days when revenue was zero.​\n\nThe economics for indie hackers show organic advantage. Customer acquisition cost essentially zero beyond initial $500 investment. Competitors paying $200-350 per customer on ads need higher revenue to break even. I'm profitable at $5400 MRR while they need $25K+ MRR to justify ad spend.​ For other indie hackers the playbook is invest in SEO foundation week one using automation to save time, publish consistently targeting buyer-intent keywords, optimize conversion ruthlessly, be patient through months 1-2 with zero revenue, track hours invested to see efficiency improving, and reinvest early revenue into more content not ads.​ The lesson is indie hacking success isn't about clever hacks but consistent execution of boring fundamentals. The compound effect of content from month one still bringing customers in month five is exactly why organic beats paid for bootstrapped builders. Patience and consistency win.\n",

It has a strict 10-minute timer and requires no phone numbers/downloads. Designed to stop catfishing and awkward dates.\n\n**The Win:** After 30 days of building and hearing crickets, I got my first paying subscriber (£4.99/mo) on Dec 31st while I was away from my keyboard.\n\n**How:** I stopped spamming social media and focused entirely on \"boring\" SEO (directories like SaaSHub and AlternativeTo). It took 3 weeks, but the organic traffic finally converted.\n\nCongrats on Beatable, looks cool!",

          "text": "So if I understood correctly, you want to be an entrepreneur by copying others?\n\nUnless you have this underserved market segment (what google did against Microsoft) then you're shooting in the void by copy pasting an existing product. Basically, if u want to copy an existing product, do not compete head-on, especially if they are already in a high position (Microsoft DOMINATED with 90% market share before google was google. There was many many other search engines before google. Search engines was a mature market at that time)\n\nYou need a different angle to hit the iron, not just copy paste the exact SaaS and say \"here you go, there's X, we are cheaper than X\" it doesn't work. Living with price will only get you far enough to die with it.\n\nHere are the existing angles to hammer on for an existing product:\n\n- **Unpopular Segment Angle:** Segments no one is designing for, only around? (Who complains that tools “aren’t built for us”? Google played here, Microsoft DOMINATED the Enterprise level but didn't look at consumers, google played here with the new business model they introduced. Free in core and paid ads as revenue stream)\n- **Risk Removal Angle:** What scares users about the existing solutions?\n- **Cognitive Load Angle:** Where are users mentally exhausted? (reduce thinking instead of adding features)\n- **Workflow Position Angle:** Where does pain spike the hardest in the workflow?\n- **Behavior Angle:** What are users actually doing when no one is watching?\n- **Outcome Ownership Angle:** What result do users actually want, not what they say they want? (I want more visibility doesn't mean they want more SaaS visibility, they want users, feedback, testers, etc)\n- **Operator Knowledge Angle:** What mistakes did you already make that users shouldn’t? (If you went through a wrong process using the tool you want to copy and your audience ALSO goes through that pain, scratch that itch with the new feature.) \n- **Trust & Legitimacy Angle:** Why are users afraid to trust existing tools?\n- **Learning Curve Angle:** Who is failing silently with current tools? (Make beginners succeed fast)\n- **Distribution Angle:** Where can this live so users don’t need to “open” it? (productivity tools fail because you have to remember they exist)\n- **Opinionated Constraint Angle:** What could you intentionally refuse to support? (deliberately stupidly simple, no extra features)\n\nAnyway, I hate giving free stuff bcs ppl rarely use or give an importance to free stuff, most just say \"Thank you so much, this is what I was looking for\" 10 days later u ask \"so? Have u used what I taught you?\" 90% will say no. Free lowers the value of everything. Remember that, not just because it's free or that you made your tool cheaper it means people will jump off the bed to swipe a credit card in your website. \n\nAgain, just bcs it's free or cheap doesn't mean people will care. Free stuff lowers the value and cheap stuff makes you look like u didn't find what to add so u made it cheap. And people who do not buy unless it's 99% discounted or it's free those are the worst people ever bcs you'll never satisfy them and they'll leave u the moment they see another cheaper alt. \n\nLet that sink in\n\n\nRen",

                  "text": "If you check my profile, you can find me talking about this multiple times. But let me summarize it. \n\nAt an early stage, you need 2 things:\n- feedback\n- validation\n\nContent as you said is just noise, ads are expensive, SEO takes time and posting on subs hoping for feedback just doesn't work. So, what's left? Outbound. Basically, inbound is you wait for the traction to come to you (SEO, content, etc) outbound is YOU go to them. (Cold outreach) \n\nEmails are tough for beginners, so u only have cold DMing as your own leverage to validate. (Unless your audience is physically reachable like dog trainers, groomers, cafes, restaurants, etc. If your audience is physically reachable then give them a visit. HIGHER trust. Start locally, your goal is to make every facility or target audience in your local town know or use your product, then scans nationally or internationally but start local if you can reach your audience) if u can't reach your audience in real life then you'd need to reach them online with cold DMing. \n\nYou'll need to find your target audience's habitat, which platform has your target audience? If your target audience uses IG the most then DM them on IG. Make sure your profile is well taken care of to look credible enough and worthy of trust bcs they WILL check your profile. I personally use reddit since most people are segmented in subs so finding them is easier (I have my own tool now) then you'd DM every single person that fits your target audience. What you'll do is find comments where they talk about you or the pain you solve and then scan their profile for a background check, copy the entire profile and put in ChatGPT and ask it to analyze it and tell you if they fit your target or not and give a score. Make a list of these until you reach 1,000 in your list (apologies for the self-promo but my tool also does this in a couple of mins) \n\nOnce u have your 1,000 list, start small, start with 50 people using a script and get a rough estimate of the conversions, then test another script. The winner is the control. Then another script then another script. Aim for nothing less than 3% conversions (mine was 6% made 414 sign ups in 3 weeks btw just cold DMing on Reddit and I did it again and got paid many times for a service I offer. Just last night I got paid again) \n\nOnce u have your scripts, start scaling up and sending more and more (when I say scripts I mean the entire conversation flow, not just the first DM, the role of the first DM is not to sell but make them reply to u so u can sell later. That's most cold DMing attempts fall flat, they sell hard on the first message)  \n\nSo, basically, your first few weeks you'll spend time optimizing instead of selling. Once your reach your KPI goals (aim for 30% reply rate and 3% conversions. 2% is average) \n\nIf you exhaust the 1,000 list with 3% conversions, you'll get 30 sign ups. With 30% reply rate, you'll be making 300 conversations with potential clients so a lot of feedback as well. \n\nSo with cold DMing, you've hit both goals:\n1. Speaking with the audience for feedback (300 conversations will uncover a lot of blind spots u didn't see)\n2. Make early users (30 active users is not a joke. Since u can talk to those users through DMs they'll give VALUABLE insights and you can make a connection with them for retention) \n\nThat's it on paper, you just need to apply it now. Yes, there are many many many other things to consider as well like the safety limits, DM structure, opener structure, closing tactics but those come with practice (be ready to blow up some accounts if u have no idea about security limits which is why I made them integrated in our platform bcs u don't just find leads u DM as well. My apologies for the self-promo btw.)\n\nNow, here's an extra tip to do while DMing:\n1. Always post content: whether you like it or not, you need to post and comment as well (that's why I'm engaging in communities now) bcs u need to get people to notice u. Never sell on posts, never share links, even the name is shady in some subs. Your goal is to educate, not sell. For example: my tool finds the leads, makes a background check, score, and DMs them your opener so you only reply to whoever replies to u and close (we'll add closing support features as well based on my experience selling) but the issue is not many people know how good cold DMing is so I need to educate first then DM them to sell. That's what I'm doing with this comment btw\n2. Backlink building: SEO is your growth engine not validation engine. DMing validates your idea and gets the early traction but SEO scales the business. So start building your domain authority WHILE DMing. No random directory backlinks, you need to find quality backlinks, 90% of those directories are pron to be spam links which hurts your DR. Make sure to post HIGH quality posts that doesn't sell but help the target audience.\n3. Commenting and helping in communities: yes, just like content, you need to engage with people. Why? Bcs when u DM them, you already had some trust points. When I was working on the old SaaS, a lot of people told me this \"yeh, we saw you talking about the tool before, looks cool\" the selling was easy from that point. So make sure to build reputation but NEVER sell on comments or posts. I didn't tell you the name of the tool I just explained the bigger picture of the tool so if I DMed u about it. You may say \"oh, yeh, I remember that, thx for the detailed response btw\" that's the role of content and engaging, NEVER sell on the posts, educate.\n4. Test post variations: speaking about reddit, test multiple posts and the one that brings engagement? Turn it to an ad and add a CTA. Never sell in the organic, your goal is to tell a story or make people you sell engage with the post like any other post. When a post brings good results, copy paste the exact format and remix it to have a small CTA with the link. This is optimizing your ads before spending a single dime.\n\nLooks like a lot? IT IS A LOT. But that's business, your building a business, not a Lego toy. I'm still staying up till 4AM working and waking up at 8AM to work again bcs it's hard to build a business. It's not a game for snowflakes which is why 90% fail bcs 90% never put the necessary work or take the necessary sacrifices. \n\n\nThat's it. Sorry for the long post btw 😅",

The biggest wins came when I, personally, felt a pain point.\n\nI used to hire a service provider and she sold business to her partner who had no idea how to run the company. I was so frustrated that I put my foot down and I said I will do this my own damn self. I pulled out my only credit card and maxed it out on the hope that others were looking for the same thing. And they were.\n\nMy friends all had the same pain point and when I executed, the clients were already to give me money. It was literally that easy. Just lots of work on my end. LOL\n\nAt that moment I didn't know it but it would lead me on the path to making more money than I have ever made.

          "text": "What you’re running into is very normal, and honestly it’s one of the hardest mental walls in indie hacking. The “X already exists” feedback feels crushing, but it’s also misleading. Almost every successful indie product is a copy with a different angle, timing, or audience. Stripe wasn’t the first payments tool. Notion wasn’t the first notes app. Screen Studio itself wasn’t the first screen recorder.\n\nThe mistake most first-time builders make isn’t copying, it’s copying the product instead of copying the customer pain. When people say “this already exists,” they’re usually talking about features, not outcomes. Your job isn’t to beat legacy tools, it’s to serve a very specific group better than they’re currently served.\n\nAlso, X is not a validation platform, it’s a commentary platform. People dunk on ideas there because it costs them nothing. The builders who win don’t ask “should I build this?” publicly. They quietly ship, find 5–10 users with a real problem, and iterate with them.\n\nWith $0, organic growth is possible, but not through “support.” It comes from distribution baked into the product or content that solves a problem people are actively searching for. Think SEO, niche communities, or tools that create shareable outputs. Money doesn’t create customers, clarity does.\n\nSince you’re a tech student, your edge is speed and learning. Build something tiny that solves one annoying problem for one type of user. Launch ugly. Get one paying customer. Then another. Indie hacking isn’t about the big idea, it’s about surviving long enough to find the right angle",

That’s usually where people freeze, procrastinate, or invent workarounds.\n\nAnother important lens: how close is that pain to money or outcomes people are measured on? What’s the actual job-to-be-done for that person?\n\nFor context, I haven’t launched anything independently yet, only products in work environments where things are safer, the market is known, and feedback is built-in. But thinking this way has helped me a lot.\n\nI’m on the same journey as you, and it’s encouraging to see others pushing through the same doubts. If I had one piece of advice: keep it so simple you’re almost embarrassed to launch it, be consistent about talking to people, and reach out directly. There are more people willing to help than it feels like at the start",

If they're satisfied, move on.\n\nThe $0 budget move: search Reddit, Twitter, and forums for complaints about the tools you want to compete with. Find the gaps the incumbents ignore. Build for those people specifically, then DM them when you ship.\n\nYou don't need an audience. You need 10 people with a problem who know you're solving it for them.\n\nThe trap isn't money it's building before you know someone's waiting for it.",
