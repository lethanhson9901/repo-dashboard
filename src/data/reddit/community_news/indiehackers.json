Our entire roadmap is 'figure it out after the Series A'.\"\n\nFeatures include:\n\n* \"Zero Latency — Our dashboard loads instantly because there is absolutely zero data processing happening. It's just HTML.\"\n* \"Security Theater — We put a lock icon next to the URL bar. That means we're SOC-2 compliant, right? (Don't check).\"\n\nLogo strip: \"TRUSTED BY COMPANIES WHO IGNORED OUR RED FLAGS\" — Scripe, Airbnble, Verchell, Curved, Raycrash\n\nThe pricing tier names are \"Decoy Tier,\" \"VC Trap,\" and \"Enterprise.\"\n\nNo product.

      "text": "Hi everyone,  \nI’m writing this mostly to vent, but also to ask for honest feedback.\n\nA few months ago, I decided to go solo and try entrepreneurship again.  \nI spent more than 9 years climbing the technical ladder (full-stack dev, senior, lead, head of engineering, CTO). I’ve seen startups from the inside: how they grow, how they break, how people burn out (including myself).\n\nI thought that experience would count for something.\n\nMy first big mistake:  \nI believed the internet rewards experience, honesty, and good intentions.\n\nI’ve asked for feedback hundreds of times.\n\nI can count the real responses I got on one hand and still have fingers left.\n\nI gave away my experience for free.  \nI built an open-source library. The reactions? Mostly criticism:  \n“this already exists”, “why reinvent the wheel”, “this is useless”.\n\nI even open-sourced the landing page of a project that won a CSS Winner Star.  \nInstead of curiosity, I got mockery:  \n“How did this even win?”, “they give awards to anyone now”.\n\nThat hurt more than I expected.\n\nMy second mistake was validation.  \nI honestly thought validation meant people saying:  \n“Wow, great idea”, “cool product”, “nice angle”.\n\nNow I understand that’s just noise.  \nValidation is when someone actually pays and nobody did.\n\nAnother lesson: words matter more than logic.  \nI started using terms like “growth” and “engagement”, until a few people helped me realize those words trigger distrust and scam vibes for many.\n\nWhat I’m still struggling to understand is this:\n\nWhy does it feel like I only get extremes?  \nEither **silence**… or **rejection**.  \nEither **no response at all**… or **negativity**.\n\nI don’t think I’m entitled to success.  \nBut I genuinely want to understand:\n\n**What am I doing wrong?**  \n**How do you find the** ***right*** **people instead of shouting into the void?**\n\nIf you’ve been there, I’d really appreciate your perspective.\n\n",

Most public spaces online aren’t built for thoughtful feedback, they’re built for fast reactions, and negativity is easier than curiosity.\n\nThe silence or rejection pattern is really common when you’re sharing things broadly without a very specific audience. Most people ignore what doesn’t speak directly to their problem, and the few who engage often do so defensively. That’s not a reflection of your experience or the quality of your work.\n\nA lot of builders hit this stage before things start to click.",

Know in your heart that if other people can achieve their goals, you can too. There’s no difference. Lastly, focus on helping the people you were meant to help. Financial rewards will follow. Oh, and being sensitive is a good thing but not re the internet. It’s too big and broad. Narrow down what you’re asking. Forget comments like ‘this is crap’. That doesn’t mean anything. It’s not specific and it pulls down without a solution to how something could be improved. Anybody can do that. What’s the other comment? Oh yeah , it’s been done before. Really? So, there’s only one make of TV? Or only one song? Or only one make of car?  Of course it’s been done before. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel just do it in your own unique way for the people you are trying to attract. That’s competition. And btw there’s more than enough for everyone to have more than enough and there’ll be more than enough left over. That’s my 2 cents. Hope it helps.",

I built it for myself so I don't really stress about whether the world likes it or not because I am already finding my own tool useful. \n\nTo find the right people - there are 2 main methods I use:-  \n1) I share my project on a niched subreddit. I think of a subreddit as an individual who has his own problems. My tool happens to help me and that person with a problem we both have. I share my tool.   \n2) I monitor for keywords on Reddit. When someone makes a post for specific keywords, I receive a notification and I DM them with my product.\n\nI am still testing method 2 but I have some success with method 1. \n\nAlso, take everything i said with a grain of salt. I am self-taught, and been doing this for 2.5 years or so only. not as experienced as you. \n\nBut best of luck to you, friend. Don't give up. You are not alone.",

You can turn those logs into structured reports on usage metrics to see where free users are, or aren't spending their time.

The pages that aren't will get deep assessments of why. 2, you have users who may not even notice a feature, create a login pop-up that brings the unused features up so they know it exists and how to use it. Make this an opt in thing where the DB logs the user response so they're not flagged on every log in.\n\nYou can't do anything on my project without me knowing, generally speaking. I log everything, but that's part of my security and compliance posture, and it's all spelled out in ToS and Privacy Policy.\n\nAdd a request feature form that can voted on publicly, after you review it. Then advertise you're doing that on your pages. Maybe you start to get some hits on why pages aren't working from that. Do the same with a bug report, have it capture appropriate details automatically from the page for debugging. Maybe you don't know a feature is buggy, people will gladly tell you.",

Every useful project started as a \"reinvention\" of something. The question isn't whether alternatives exist, it's whether yours solves a specific problem better for specific people.\n\nOn finding the right people: stop broadcasting to forums and start having conversations with individuals. DM 10 people who've complained about the exact problem you're solving. Most won't reply, but the 2-3 who do will give you more signal than 100 Reddit comments.\n\nYour validation lesson is spot on though. Compliments cost nothing. Payments reveal truth.",

It's literally the wild west, people want you off their property, you're that sleezy salesman guy that nobody wants to interact with.\n\nI was introverted and personally also thought these salesmen are the worst, until I become one. It's cut throat and no one is going to give you a free handout. The only thing I knew was that there were a few guys in the office constantly making sales and I was like \"wtf how do these guys constantly do it.\". \n\nAgain, I'm not at your stage yet so I am prepared to get the burn later on, but what I learned was that you're not going to get better if you keep blaming the void. We learned this tactic called feature vs benefits. \"My app has XYZ features, e.g. AI implementation\" when it should have been \"You'll be able to spend more time with your kids now\". \n\nJust seeing how you write your post, I can't help but noticed you wrote \"I\" like a bijillion times. The goal we are all working towards should be that our products will provide value to people. It's not the \"I thought the internet rewards experience, honesty, and good intentions. but I was wrong\" it's \"why can't I convey myself more authentically and genuinely \". People blow up online for being genuine, its just we need to work on how can we convey that to the void better.",

They want to know how it benefits them.\n\nYou're also right about being authentic and genuine, and I've tried, I won't deny it. Every time I give something away or post something, I give 100%, but I feel like I'm on someone's property who doesn't want visitors and is in a bad mood. They not only want me to leave, but they also want my head on a platter. \n\nBut like you say, I have that question of how to be more, I don't say authentic, nor genuine, I think it's nice, because it's a matter of someone reading and saying I like this, I feel like people read and say I have to burn it.",

If you're going to be on someone's property who obviously knows you're there to sleezy salesman them, even offering something free will cause suspicion. They won't think \"wow he's being nice\". Their guard is already up, most of the internet already is like that.\n\nI mentioned those guys in the office who constantly kept making sales, we sold the same product with the same features but yet they made so much more. I spoke with them and learnt a lot which helped me get better. I thought they would be pushy, sleezy and cunning but those guys were the complete opposite. They were incredibly likeable.\n\nSorry to spew what I was taught, but basically how you write your post is more important than what you're posting/offering. Someone could take the same ideas from your post, reword it, (with understanding the context of the audience they are posting to), and be able to sound completely different to you. I wholehearted can guarantee this is fact.\n\nHow is that possible? Its not so simple, one way is he becomes a valuable member of that community first, then people trust what he's saying. Whenever I made a sale, the chances of me closing his neighbour was higher because if I sold to John, the chances his neighbour would trust me would go up. Life works in the same way, and so does the internet. Sorry again, this doesn't give an exact to-do but I hope you can view it with a different perspective at least.",

Ignore the noise. Some people criticize just to feel smart. That’s not signal.\n2. Build smaller circles instead of shouting into the void. This thread proved that real conversations still exist.\n3. Validation is not “this is a great product”. Validation is **“I’m paying for this.”**\n4. Focus on benefits, not features. Nobody buys features.\n\nAnd today something small but important happened:  \n**my first user entered their card.**  \nIt’s just one person, but it feels more real than a thousand compliments.\n\nSo today, I’m shipping.  \nI’m launching **KironX** on Product Hunt with a much clearer mentality: listen, validate, repeat.\n\nIf anyone here feels like checking it out or supporting, I’d really appreciate it.  \nI’ll share the Product Hunt link in the comments.\n\nThanks again to everyone who took the time to reply to my previous post.  \nThis community genuinely helped me move forward.\n\nTime to face the world.",

The noise there is unreal.\n\nSome new launches had 60–70 upvotes within minutes, which honestly felt off. My launch dropped past position 50 almost immediately, so it wasn't even visible anymore. At that point, it feels less like discovery and more like a popularity/farming game.\n\nWhat I did take away though aligns a lot with what you said:\n- One real user > hundreds of anonymous upvotes  \n- Conversations and feedback matter way more than leaderboard position  \n- PH can help, but it's not the signal people think it is - especially early on\n\nSo yeah, even if PH didn't work out for me, shipping still mattered. Learning still mattered. And that one person willing to pay is worth more than trending for an hour.\n\nRooting for your launch - and your mindset here is 100% the right one.  \nListen -> validate -> repeat",

Validate first or at least early in the process\n2. Focus on marketing/distribution. I used to believe that just making a great product was enough. I thought it would speak for itself, but in this crowded world, if you don't help people find it, it's like it doesn't even exist.\n\nDo you have any hard-won advice on how to validate? Especially if the product isn't far enough along to have people use it yet?",

You know I have two features on hold because I don't know if they'll sell or not.",

It's so hard to try to figure out if people will use something that doesn't exist, and once it exists, if no one is using it, it's hard to know if that's because no one wants it, the price is too high, or if the people who need it, and are willing to pay for it, don't know it exists.\n\nWere you able to find small circles of people who have the pain your product solves?

I lost because Product Hunt is no longer a distribution channel for founders without an audience.\n\nI’ve spent weeks thinking about distribution for **KironX**, a small Chrome extension that helps filter noise on X and highlights which posts are actually worth replying to especially if you don’t have a big account.\n\nAfter days posting on Reddit and X, I had visits, installs… and **one actual conversion**.  \nSo I decided to launch on Product Hunt.  \nNot to validate the market, just to get visibility and feedback.\n\nThat’s how I *thought* Product Hunt worked.\n\n# What launch day really felt like\n\nVotes opened at 12:00 a.m. US time (≈9 a.m. in France).\n\nFour minutes in:\n\n* I had 1 vote (mine)\n* Several products already had 60+ votes\n\nThat was the first punch.\n\nI posted on LinkedIn.  \nWithin minutes, I got DMs selling upvotes:  \n“$50 for 100 votes.”\n\nThat’s when it clicked.\n\nProduct Hunt isn’t:\n\n* the best product wins\n* the best distribution wins\n\nIt’s closer to a beauty contest + paid amplification.\n\n  \n**The part people don’t talk about**\n\nI did consider cheating.  \nCrypto only. Wise transfers. No invoices. No trace.\n\nI stopped there.\n\nI decided to fight with bare hands.\n\nI kept replying on Reddit, Discord, and X.  \nI even used KironX itself to reply to live posts and say I was launching.\n\nThat part actually worked.\n\n# Real results (no hype)\n\n* Finished 35th\n* 11 installs\n* New users completed onboarding\n* Real feedback\n* A new Chrome Store review\n* \\~9 visitors came directly from Product Hunt\n\nMost DMs were either:\n\n* vote sellers\n* “security disclosures”\n\nMy real distribution still comes from X, Google, CSS Winner, and TechTrendin.\n\n  \n**What I learned**\n\nThe market is saturated. What worked 1–2 years ago doesn’t work the same today.\n\n*Mass distribution is overcrowded.*\n\nWhat *does* work:\n\n* smaller, trusted communities\n* being where your users already are\n* earning trust over time\n\nUsers who try KironX like it.  \nIt works. It helps. It doesn’t disappoint.\n\nNow the mission is clear:  \n**find the nest where your users already live.**\n\nFor KironX, that place is X itself.\n\n# Open question\n\nI’d genuinely love to hear from founders who launched on Product Hunt this year. Tell me,  \nHow did it go for you?\n\nI finished **35th**, which honestly isn’t bad given my distribution.  \nFor those planning to launch soon, these were my signals and my reality.\n\n[9 visitors from PH](https://preview.redd.it/wn8k0se9s2gg1.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=00c95df8140978230e21910e45e757c7e1a2ae30)\n\n",

You bring your own audience to show \"social proof\" to the next set of users. You did the right thing by fighting bare-handed. That feedback you got is worth more than a vanity ranking.",

All of them are way too complex for early-stage SaaS.\n\nMeanwhile, 40% of churn is just failed payments that nobody followed up on.\n\nSo I built something stupid simple: Connect Stripe, we send recovery emails, you see results in 48 hours. Free while in beta.\n\nLooking for 5 beta testers to validate this works. Free for a month.\n\nIf you're tired of paying enterprise pricing for a simple problem, let me know.\n\nComment or DM.\n\n",

      "text": "When I launched my directory, I made the classic mistake.\n\nI thought: “If the product is useful, people will just show up.”\n\nThey… did at my scale but it paid me $0.\n\nDirectories look simple from the outside.\n\n* Visibility (Traffic)\n* Backlinks (SEO)\n* Social proof via scores and rankings\n\nI started by ranking sites by their monthly views, inspired by [trustmrr.com](http://trustmrr.com), but about views/traffic : [trustviews.io](http://trustviews.io) (yes I copied it)\n\nThe first idea: charge for detailed analytics.\n\nOn paper, it made sense.\n\nIn practice, it failed.\n\nAnalytics only get valuable when you you go in details and are cheap. I was cheap but not detailed.\n\nSo I shifted.\n\nInstead of selling analytics, I turned Trustviews into a “classical” directory business model with ad slots on the side.\n\nZero meaningful clicks.\n\nSo for now, I’ve filled most of the space with affiliate links, and I’m leaving 3 out of 10 slots open.\n\nThose will be for actual sponsors later, when the traffic justifies it.\n\nThen, I talked to someone running multiple successful directories and making money out of it.\n\nHe told me everything I was doing wrong. So I’ll turn my directory into something I did not truly understood at first : paid listing.\n\nTo me it’s just slowing down growth, as less people would come in. But here is the trick :\n\n* If you want a dofollow backlink, you pay. (= I earn money & you win SEO & visibility)\n* If you don’t want to pay, you can still get listed, but you install the badge on your landing page to get that dofollow backlink. (= I earn SEO & you get visibility).\n\nThat one idea changed how I think about directories. Because indeed it’s all about what everyone get and it’s quite healthy if you ask me.\n\nThis is the other lesson:\n\nMost monetization ideas only work once you have real traction.\n\nUntil then, they’re just decoration.\n\nTo make Trustviews actually unique, I’m leaning into something different.\n\nA weekly newsletter.\n\nNot a “here are 10 tools” list.\n\nMore like:\n\n* How these projects get consistent views\n* Why traffic spikes happen\n* What strategies caused them\n* Interviews with founders behind the listings\n\nThe goal is to make the directory feel alive.\n\nNot just a wall of logos, but a community and a learning engine.\n\nIf I do this right, Trustviews becomes more than a place to dump your link.\n\nIt becomes a place where:\n\n* You understand how people actually got attention\n* Your project gets ongoing visibility, not a one-time launch\n* Readers learn distribution by watching real examples\n\nA few lessons from this whole experiment so far:\n\n1. A directory without a clear edge is just another list.\n2. Monetization has to line up with what founders actually value: backlinks, traffic, and proof they can show.\n3. Turning a directory into a media product newsletter, interviews, insights might be the real moat.\n\nThis is all still in motion.\n\nI’m earning nothing, but learning a lot, and adjusting as I go.\n\nNone of this is theory.\n\nIt’s just what I’ve tried, what failed (no actual fail), and what seems to be working.\n\nIf you run a directory, buy listings, or have ideas on better models, I’d love to hear them.\n\nReply and tell me what you’ve seen work.",

In that case newsletter is one of the hypothesis. If that’s the case, I’d first look for a signal to validate that it’s the right way to go. \nThe challenge might be to get people to sign up to your newsletter first but that’s fine if you see acquisition happening top of the funnel. \nWhat I wouldn’t do is the following. To put all my bets in newsletter before I actually see any signal of it working. \nWhat I wouldn’t do: if you see people are even signing up to the newsletter, track link clicks and time on page for the newsletter click. If you see some people who are actually clicking more than once in a defined time period, try to understand who they are and double down on that type of user. They might be just the segment that will join a community.\n\nMind also that retention problems usually are engagement problems - this leads to habit formation loops. If you see people joining but not engaging, check that.\n\nBottomline, I guess you need to state well what kind of product and business problem you are trying to solve. Start there and reverse engineer towards the goal depending on what you’re trying to do.",

Whiteboards. Proven frameworks like SWOT analysis, Six Thinking Hats, assumption reversal. They stress-test every angle before writing a single line of code.\n\nThat's 40 hours minimum. Multiply that by 6-8 people on the team, and you're looking at 240-320 person-hours of structured thinking before execution begins.\n\nNow here's what a solo founder does (and yes, I'm guilty of this):\n\nWe get an idea. We think about it in the shower. Maybe we write down a few notes. Then we open ChatGPT: \"Is this a good idea?\" ChatGPT: \"Yes! Great market opportunity!\"\n\nTotal time invested: 30 minutes.\n\nThen we start coding. Because that feels productive. Planning feels like procrastination.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tlskaq2jkagg1.png?width=2752&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f564ccb029592939f142b422d1cb4b652ab7c06\n\n**Here's the backwards part:**\n\nBig tech can afford to fail. If a project flops, they write it off as R&D. Their risk tolerance is infinite.\n\nSolo founders cannot afford to fail. If you spend 4 months building the wrong thing, that's 4 months of savings, energy, and opportunity cost you'll never get back.\n\nYet big tech teams spend 40 hours planning. We spend 30 minutes.\n\n**The pattern I keep seeing:**\n\nBig tech borrowed startup execution speed (\"move fast and break things\"). But they kept their planning rigor.\n\nSolo founders copied the execution speed (\"just ship it\"). But we skipped the planning rigor.\n\nWe took the wrong lesson.\n\nWhen someone at a big tech company says \"just ship it,\" they're saying it AFTER a week of brainstorming with a cross-functional team. When a solo founder says \"just ship it,\" they're saying it after a shower thought and a ChatGPT chat.\n\n**\"But shouldn't I just talk to customers instead of planning?\"**\n\nYes. You absolutely should talk to customers. But here's the thing: you should do the hard thinking BEFORE those conversations, not after.\n\nIf you go into customer interviews without a clear hypothesis, without having challenged your own assumptions, you'll waste those early conversations. You won't know what questions to ask. You won't recognize when someone is being polite versus genuinely interested. And if you seem uncertain or confused about your own idea, they won't take you seriously enough to give you real feedback.\n\nThose first 10-20 potential customers are precious. They're your most valuable data source. Don't burn them by showing up unprepared.\n\nStructured thinking makes customer conversations 10x more valuable. It doesn't replace them.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\nI'm not saying you need to spend a week planning. You don't have a team of 8. You don't have infinite runway.\n\nBut you need more than 30 minutes.\n\nYou need to borrow their frameworks, not their budgets. You need to simulate the pushback a team would give you. You need to challenge your own assumptions before the market does.\n\nBecause the irony is brutal: Those who can afford to fail plan the most. Those who can't afford to fail don't plan at all.\n\n**What I do now:**\n\nI force myself to spend 2-3 days on structured brainstorming before writing code. I use the same frameworks big tech uses (Six Thinking Hats, SCAMPER, assumption reversal..).\n\nIt feels slow. It feels unproductive. But it's the only effective way I've found to avoid wasting months on the wrong thing.",

It still takes time to develop an MVP. If you blow two weeks building and learn it's the wrong thing, that's still slower than one week of research and planning.\n2. Whatever you decide to \"just ship\" will have a ton of assumptions built-in, and customer feedback won't necessarily help you. For example, if you build a mobile app, but your ICP really would have preferred a white-glove service, it's almost impossible to get that feedback once your mobile app has users, because they think of your product as an app.\n3. It assumes you have or can easily get customers. If you just ship and it's crickets, it's hard to figure out what you did wrong. But it's avoidable. Research and planning are the key.\n4. Brand takes years to build, but it can be destroyed in days. If you ship something that breaks or pisses off customers, word will spread. You may not care, and if the product is young enough you can even quickly rebrand. But I do think there are real long-term consequences to shipping a half-baked product.\n\nThe middle ground between \"corporate\" and \"YOLO\" is actually pretty doable. If you talk to exactly five potential users or current customers, you're getting 90% of the value of a full research project. You don't even really need frameworks to move forward from research; you will naturally identify themes, and if you discuss the feedback for a day or two, you will pull out some insights. From there you can brainstorm based on the research, and either do a second round of interviews to refine the concept, or just go ahead with one. Either way, you've significantly improved your starting point.\n\nEven in the age of vibe coding it still takes time to bang out a product, so it's a good investment.",

But something we are VERY conscious of across our SaaS portfolio (wildfront.co/#portfolio) and with our founder community, is:\n\nBig tech co's spend forever planning... maybe sometimes TOO much time... because a shit ton rests on that planning. Indie hackers, bless us, with 20-50 customers, can ship stuff fast because the stakes are low.\n\nThat's not a luxury that big tech has, if millions or hundreds of millions are relying on your service to be consistent. So while there's definitely a lot of 'meeting bloat' and BS going on, big tech are \\*CASH COWS\\* and having a bootstrapper mentality if you're Google, doesn't work\n\nIn the same way, you'll die of overbuilding and handwringing if you try to act like an enterprise tech team when you're a tiny bootstrapped co... since you don't have that luxury :)\n\nSo it's more a matter of self assessing: \"**how much time should we spend planning and prepping and researching, based on how much we have to lose vs to gain from this?**\"\n\nThat's my heuristic from being on the receiving end of a FLOOD of bug related support tickets, because we once shipped something with a bug that hundreds of people used every day, whereas on the other hand with our apps that have 5-10 DAUs, we can afford to deploy things a little quicker\n\nOpen to disagreement from y'all here though for sure",

              "text": "Happy to break it down. Here's my current process:\nI split planning into two phases: brainstorming and synthesis.\n\nPhase 1: Structured brainstorming (Day 1-2)\nI use proven frameworks to look at the idea from multiple angles. Not random thinking, but systematic:\nSix Thinking Hats: I force myself to wear each hat separately. White Hat (just the facts), Red Hat (gut feeling), Yellow Hat (why it could work), Black Hat (why it will fail), Green Hat (alternatives), Blue Hat (process check). The Black Hat is where most people skip, but it's the most valuable.\nSCAMPER: I run the idea through modification prompts. Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse. This surfaces variations I'd never think of otherwise.\nAssumption Reversal: I list every assumption the idea depends on, then flip each one backwards and defend the opposite. Half my assumptions collapse under this test.\nAs I go through these, I take structured notes. Not scattered thoughts, but organized by framework. I'm building a living document that captures the thinking process.\n\nPhase 2: Synthesis (Day 2-3)\nI take all those insights and compile them into a project brief. This has:\nProblem statement (validated, not assumed)\nProposed solution (with alternatives considered)\nTarget users (specific, not vague)\nRisks and fatal flaws (identified upfront)\nUnit economics (rough, but realistic)\nSuccess metrics (defined before building)\nThe brief becomes my source of truth. When I use Cursor or Claude or any AI tool, I paste this brief in first. It gives them context so they stop hallucinating generic solutions.\nTotal time: 4 to 6 hours spread over 2 to 3 days. Not continuous. I do a session, sleep on it, come back fresh.\nThe hard part is forcing yourself through the Black Hat when you're excited. But that's the whole point. Challenge assumptions BEFORE you're emotionally invested.\n\nDoes this help? Happy to go deeper on any specific framework.",

Companies struggle to say “we don’t know” out loud, so they replace uncertainty with frameworks, workshops, and slide decks.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: in most successful products, the clean story is written *after* the outcome. We retro-fit meaning to what happened. You can’t do that upfront with real accuracy.\n\nFor solo founders, copying big-tech planning rituals is often a trap. You don’t need to convince 12 stakeholders. You need to make a reasonable bet, ship something testable, and stay flexible enough to change course fast when reality disagrees.\n\nAlso, instinct isn’t “guessing”. It’s compressed experience: pattern recognition built from years of context. The catch is that you can’t always translate it into a deck that convinces a room, but it can still be valid.\n\nSo yeah: think seriously, but don’t fetishize planning.

I am Jst Tan, currently taking a few gap months until college, and looking to make something meaningful in life, as well as make some money for college. \n\nI noticed that vibe coding is very popular at the moment. Why wouldn't it? People with non-technical skills or people with technical skills can sit back, prompt and get a website quickly and with low cost, since they do not need to hire a developer. Personally, I used it myself frequently too. \n\nHowever, many people here know that vibe coding has many disadvantages, from security vulnerabilities, a ton of bugs, AI hallucinating and much more. These can be very troublesome when they are deployed. However, although this is AI fault, it is also caused by the lack of constraints set by us. \n\n  \nWhich is why I am thinking of building a project/product where there will be: \n\n* Agent Rules \n* Agent Skills \n* AI Agents (sub-agent)\n* Website starter kit (authentication, payment, newsletter, database, analytics, premium UI components, to avoid AI creating hallucinating code) \n* Security checklist \n* Launch checklist \n* Affiliate program list \n* Website builder agent \n* Terms of Services & Privacy Policy agent \n* MCP list to enhance the AI\n\nWith all of these, we can create constraints onto AI, and enforce it to create a ready to launch website quickly without too much worries, while ensuring that AI can produce better codes together.  \n  \nI am currently considering in whether I should make this into a premium paid offering or offer it open source. I would love the opinion of the community. For those who recommended open source, I would love to hear your thoughts on how I can make a little money for college.   \n  \nI am not looking to sell or anything, just planning everything out, and I believe that with community feedback, I can make a better decision and shape a better product. Love to hear the opinion of everyone here. ",

In order to polish the prompts I always mention the folder structure/relevant files to change in the prompt and a well defined markdown files (product idea, architecture, positioning etc.).\nSomething you should look into.",

          "text": "Interesting idea. A few thoughts:\n\nThe problem you're solving is real – vibe coding outputs are often messy and not production-ready. But the list of features you mentioned is massive. Authentication, payments, UI components, legal docs, security checklists, affiliate programs... that's a lot of scope for a gap-year project.\n\nMy suggestion: pick one thing and nail it. What's the single most painful part of going from \"vibe coded prototype\" to \"actually deployed product\"? Start there. You can always expand later.\n\nOn open source vs paid: you could do both. Open source the core (builds trust, gets adoption), charge for hosted version or premium templates. Lots of indie hackers do this successfully.\n\nOne more thing: before building, talk to 10-15 people who vibe code regularly. Ask them what actually breaks for them. You might find the biggest pain point isn't what you expect.\n\nGood luck with it and props for building instead of just consuming during your gap months.",

          "text": "First off, love the hustle, using gap months to build is the best education you'll ever get. Here’s the reality: you are building a \"monster\" product. You listed 10+ major features. If you try to build all of them at once, you’ll never launch. My advice? Pick ONE.   \n  \nIf you want money for college, the \"Website starter kit\" is the fastest path. Look at ShipFast, it’s a multi-million dollar business that is essentially a high-quality starter kit. Don't build the \"AI Agent\" suite yet, build the rock-solid base that prevents the AI from hallucinating. Go for a paid offering. Open source is great for your resume, but if the goal is college funds, you need to capture value from day one.",
