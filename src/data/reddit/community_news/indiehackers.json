I’ve had the privilege of helping him shape it using my psychology expertise, testing it firsthand, and helping ensure it’s safe, user-led, and trauma-informed.\n\n\nPrivacy is built-in: nothing you share is sold or exposed, and even Adonis does not see your data.\n\n\nHe is adding a gentle, optional user assessment. It’s not a test, it’s not diagnostic, it simply helps Haven adapt to the user’s needs while fully respecting boundaries.\n\n\nYou can find Haven by searching for “Haven by Prometheus Systems” in your browser. For now, it works best on a Windows laptop or desktop, but an app is coming soon!\n\n\nHaven is always evolving. Any feedback you share would mean the world to Adonis, and me. Thank you for helping us make Haven even better.\n\n\n— Logan",

Massive system prompts don't scale when you have 50 different templates.\n\nThe solution I built is a SaaS that treats Markdown as the source of truth for agentic logic. Instead of a 2,000-word prompt, domain experts (lawyers, engineers, auditors) define the \"workflow\" in Markdown. The agent then runs this server-side via RPC, using the Markdown structure to maintain state and conduct a guided dialogue with the user.",

      "text": "I've been building software for over 15 years. Worked at Bloomberg and Shopify as an engineer, started a few companies. So when I started vibe coding with Lovable, I figured I'd skip most of the beginner mistakes. I was wrong about that.\n\nHere's what actually caught me off guard across 8 builds (affirmations app, pomodoro timer, cat of the day, dating bio rewriter, cancel plans generator, recipe app, workout timer, astrology app):\n\n**Auth is where most vibe-coded apps silently break.** Every AI tool will give you a login screen that works when you type in the right email and password. That's the happy path. But try entering wrong credentials, or sign up with a password that doesn't meet requirements, or test the Google OAuth flow when consent gets denied. Most of the time the error handling is either missing or the messages are gibberish. I spent more time fixing auth edge cases than building actual features on several of these apps. And here's the real kicker: I added a major feature to one of my apps and Lovable's model went and rewrote parts of my auth flow in the process. Suddenly nobody could log in. That regression cost me more time than the feature itself.\n\n**Meta-prompting changed my output quality overnight.** Instead of going straight to Lovable with \"build me an affirmations app,\" I started describing my product vision to Claude first and asking it to generate the Lovable prompt for me. Claude adds structure, specificity, visual design direction, page-by-page breakdowns. The difference in what Lovable produces from a meta-prompt vs. a cold prompt is dramatic. I do this for every build now.\n\n**The 90/90 problem is real.** AI gets you 90% of the way in about 90 seconds. The last 10%, error states, edge cases, polish, that's where 90% of your actual time goes. Most tutorials skip this part entirely, which is why so many people hit a wall after their first build looks great but doesn't actually hold up.\n\n**Niche apps outperform \"big idea\" apps every time.** I built a generic pomodoro timer and a pomodoro timer specifically for writers. The writer-specific one got more interest by a wide margin. Same with the workout timer. I didn't build it for gym people. I built it for people who hate the gym. The more specific your audience, the less competition you have and the more your users feel like you built it for them. Because you did.\n\n**Meme apps get traction that serious apps don't.** The cancel plans excuse generator got more attention than apps I spent significantly longer on. My take: we're in a moment where anyone can build an app in 20 minutes, so the ones that break through are the ones that make people laugh and hit share. Big companies can't afford to look ridiculous. Their brand won't let them. That makes silly apps surprisingly safe territory.\n\nThose were the big ones. Happy to get into specifics on any of these if people have questions. I've been documenting my builds so I have a lot of the details fresh.",

I spend a lot of time going through periodic code reviews and then focus sessions on removing technical debt, ensuring patters are followed etc. This is particularly important as when you go back to feature development - consistent code patterns helps the AI understand the and interact with the code structure in a predictable way. Everything has units tests that get run all the time. However now that I am well past MVP (and it's the building side I enjoy the most) - more and more time is spent on generating interest, running betas, social media, etc. I suspect this will become more and more the case as it becomes easier to build very application software.

Some things which I personally found quite underrated:  \n1. Documentation: When humans forget context, we can ask clarifying questions. When agents forget context, they confidently hallucinate.  \n2. Test cases: Getting AI to generate test cases is easy. Knowing what should be tested is the real craft. What happens if the payment fails after OTP verification? What if the user refreshes mid-checkout? What if they’re halfway through a subscription flow and switch devices?  \n3. Explicit assumptions: In legacy processes, assumptions were painfully documented. Now they’re often implicit prompts, that’s risky. If you don’t define constraints, AI fills the gaps — and not always in ways your users would.",

It doesn't mean it's bad. It means you haven't tested it against reality yet, and more building won't change that.\n\nThe \"should I give up\" question gets a lot easier when you reframe it as \"do I have any external evidence that this matters to anyone other than me.\"",

The key was being transparent about what the project actually had (some SEO juice, a working codebase, a decent domain) vs what it needed (marketing, time, maybe a pivot). Buyers appreciated honesty over hype.\n\n  \nOther places worth checking: [Acquire.com](http://Acquire.com) if the project has any revenue at all, even small. 1KProjects for stuff under $1k. Flippa works but its noisy, you will get a lot of tire kickers. Indiemaker is newer but specifically built for this.\n\n  \nFor the projects I let die, my biggest regret is not open sourcing them. If you cant sell it, throwing it on GitHub with a good README at least gives it a second life and sometimes drives traffic back to your other stuff.\n\n  \nOne thing I learned the hard way: the longer you wait, the less a project is worth. Domains expire, dependencies get outdated, whatever small SEO you had decays. If you know you are not coming back to it, list it now even if the price is embarrassingly low. Someone paying $200 for your abandoned project is better than it sitting there costing you renewal fees.",

Flippa was a waste of time, just lowballers and tire kickers. The thing that actually worked best was posting in niche communities related to the projects problem space, not as a sales pitch but more like \"hey i built this thing and dont have time for it, anyone want it?\" Got way more genuine interest that way than any marketplace.",

Got 2 paying customers, even had meetings with directors of global companies, but ultimately it is too much work to try to get customers and big companies are turned off from working with a solo founder.\n\n  \n2nd product: \"Strava for everything\". It was a social network where you can link all your APIs, e.g. Stripe, Steam, GitHub, YouTube, Chess etc and share your updates with friends. Still running, but I've stopped working on it, got about 50 signups.\n\n  \n3rd product: Helps people reduce their carbon emissions and save money. You can scan a product and it tells you lower carbon alternatives and the price difference. I did a startup programme for this at a university, got about 200 signups, some daily active users, but hard to increase retention and haven't implemented monetisation.\n\n  \n4th product: Filters your raw notification feed from X to only tell you replies that are relevant, based on your instructions. E.g. \"Only send me replies where people are asking about my product\". Saves time and prevents doomscrolling after you only went on X because someone liked your post. Started building it on Saturday, launched it on Sunday (last night). Link: [https://www.raw-bot.com/](https://www.raw-bot.com/)\n\nAfter the 3rd product, I decided that if I make another app it will have monetisation as the core feature and have it built in right away. Not \"build an app, get users and then hope you can monetise them later.\" I'd rather have 5 paying users than 200 free ones. So, that's what I've built, it's super basic but it provides value with the core feature. Let's see how it goes!  \n",

That's a pretty big shift from your first 3 which all came from personal pain points. I wonder if the monetization-first mindset accidentally pushed you away from the \"build for yourself\" instinct that generated your best ideas.\n\n\n\nNot saying it's wrong — plenty of successful products were built for other people's problems. But there's a weird middle ground where you end up optimizing for \"what could someone pay for\" instead of \"what do I desperately need\" and the product ends up kinda lukewarm. You know the problem intellectually but you don't feel it in your gut, so you make slightly off decisions about what matters.\n\n\n\nYour B2B review tool had paying customers and you walked away from it because distribution was painful. That's the one I'd go back to honestly. The product-market fit was there, you just hated the sales process. Finding a cofounder who loves cold outreach might be easier than finding product-market fit from scratch again.",

It felt like I was running in circles trying to build a user base while figuring out how to make money.\n\nYour focus on monetization from day one with your fourth product is a smart move. I wish I had that insight earlier. It’s definitely a game changer when you prioritize getting paying users right off the bat. \n\nI’m excited to see how your raw notification filter evolves; it sounds like a solution to a real pain point! Good luck!",

You had a B2B tool with actual paying customers and walked away because sales was exhausting solo. That's the one with product-market fit.\n\nOne thing that helped me: offering a lifetime deal at launch. It filters for people who actually want the product (they're paying real money), gives you immediate cash flow, and creates a base of users who are invested in your success. It also eliminates the \"will they churn\" anxiety that comes with subscriptions when you only have 5 customers. You can always add a subscription tier later once you know the product sticks.",

Affiliate model with translation services - there is huge intent behind Spanglish searches, people actually want to communicate across languages\n\n2. Ad revenue on the translation queries - this is high-volume, low-intent traffic which works well for display ads\n\n3. Language learning angle - Spanglish users are often people trying to improve their English or Spanish, could upsell courses\n\nThe smart move might be validating one monetization angle quickly before handing it off. Set up Google AdSense for a week, see what CPM you get. Run one affiliate link test. That data makes the asset way more valuable to a buyer.\n\nWhat kind of traffic are you seeing right now even without any SEO work?\n\n",

The \"setup tax\" before hitting record is real.  \n  \nThe 700k/month search volume is wild though. That's way more demand than most indie projects start with. Even if you're not marketing it hard, SEO alone could get you some natural traction if the on-page stuff is optimized.  \n  \nWhat's the current traffic like?

A few weeks ago, I made \"[Honest PMM](https://thehonestpmm.com),\" a satirical landing page mocking SaaS tropes, specifically to drive traffic to Oden.\n\nIt was a marketing experiment. That's it.\n\nDid it work?\n\nKind of. The satirical page got way more attention than my actual product:\n\n\\- 756 users, 4K events on Honest PMM\n\n\\- Peaked around Jan 25 with \\~600 users in a day\n\n\\- Decent engagement, people actually played around with it\n\n\\- Traffic to Oden from it? Modest. Signups? 2\n\nSo the experiment was fun, got some laughs, sparked a few good DMs from PMMs venting about their actual problems. But it didn't convert the way I hoped.\n\nThe mistake I made:\n\nI should have launched Oden on Product Hunt when Honest PMM was peaking. I didn't. I was still tweaking things. Now the traffic is basically gone and I'm launching anyway.\n\nBut I am doing that now, Tell me how you would have capitalised the momentum?\n\nWould love of you could support the [PH launch](https://www.producthunt.com/products/oden?launch=oden)",

That audience mismatch is the core issue, not just timing.\n\n  \nWhat I would have done differently:\n\n  \n1) Put a sticky banner on Honest PMM that says something like \"This is satire. The real tool that does this properly is Oden\" with a one-click demo. You had 756 people on the page and almost no bridge between the joke and the product.\n\n  \n2) Captured emails on the satire page itself. Even a simple \"Want more PMM roasts? Drop your email\" would have given you a list to nurture. Those 756 users are gone forever now.\n\n  \n3) The PH launch timing you mentioned is correct but I would have gone further. Cross-post the satire to Twitter and LinkedIn tagging product marketing people, then launch Oden on PH the next day while the conversation is still warm. You want people seeing the joke and the real product within the same 48 hour window.\n\n  \n4) Turn the satirical content into a series. One viral page is a spike. A weekly roast of SaaS landing page tropes builds an audience that eventually becomes your funnel.\n\n  \nThe good news is the experiment proved something valuable: you can create content that gets attention. Most people cant do that at all. The missing piece is just the conversion infrastructure between the attention and the product.",

Honestly, that feels like a longer, more uncertain road right now and my anxiety is already high enough.\n\nSo I'm at a crossroads:\n\n1. Stop everything. Close the experiment, focus on getting hired.\n2. Keep going. Use my own product to find opportunities and see what happens even if it's risky.\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nI'll post Day 28 tomorrow and share whether this actually led anywhere.",

Before that, I had been doing some indie hacking on and off, but I never planned to quit my job for it.\n\nGetting laid off changed things. Even if I found a new job, the anxiety of “I could be let go again anytime” really stuck with me. That’s when I started taking indie hacking more seriously, while still consistently applying for jobs in parallel.\n\nTo be honest about the results so far: there haven’t been many. I haven’t been able to land a job for months (and the developer job market is extremely tough globally right now). On top of that, I’m in a situation where I don’t have enough savings to cover living expenses much longer, so if I don’t get a job soon, things get very difficult.\n\nBecause of that, I’ve decided to pause indie hacking for now and focus fully on job hunting. It’s been about two weeks already.\n\nI’ve completely stopped building, although I’m still doing some promotion and sharing what I’ve built. but there’s no clear signal of when (or if) that will lead anywhere. There’s also no guarantee that users would actually pay for the product I made.\n\nPersonally, unless I’m in a stable financial situation, I wouldn’t walk away from a job.",

Use KironX to land yourself a role or consulting gig, keep building on the side, and now your story is “I literally used this tool to get hired.” That’s a founder story people actually share.\nDon’t stop the build in public series either way. That alone is creating distribution you’ll regret killing.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Treat job hunting like a sprint not a marathon. Set aside 2 focused hours a day for applications and networking, then spend the rest on your product. You will burn out if you try to do both full-time simultaneously.\n\n  \n2. Use your product as a portfolio piece in interviews. When someone asks about side projects or technical skills, the fact that you built and shipped a real product with real users is more impressive than any coding challenge answer.\n\n  \n3. Contract/freelance work can be a bridge. It buys runway without the full time commitment and often leads to full time offers anyway if you want them.\n\n  \n4. 29 days feels like nothing but if you are disciplined about spending, you can stretch it. Cut everything non-essential today not when you hit day 10.\n\n  \nThe anxiety of running out of money makes every decision feel binary. It is not. Get the income flowing from any source and suddenly the pressure lifts enough that you can think clearly about the product again.",

How many are paying? Is this thing growing?\n\nIndie Panel fixes that. You connect your PostgreSQL databases (works with Neon, Supabase, or any standard Postgres) and immediately get a clean dashboard with:\n\n\\- Total users and paid user counts\n\n\\- Growth trends and daily snapshots\n\n\\- Charts that track your metrics over time\n\n\\- AES-256 encrypted database connections\n\nIt's one dashboard for all your projects, so you can stop context-switching between databases and focus on building.\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback! What metrics do you wish you had better visibility into across your projects? \n\n  \nP.S. I'm launching on ProductHunt, where you'll find a 30% off coupon!\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/indie-panel?launch=indie-panel](https://www.producthunt.com/products/indie-panel?launch=indie-panel)",

Now I literally just message my agent \"post this to facebook tomorrow at 2pm\" and it's done. I can ask it what's scheduled, delete stuff, cross-post to multiple platforms. All from the same chat where I do everything else.\n\nIt clicked because when in the middle of something, had an idea for a post, just type out to the agent instead of bookmarking it for later. It actually went up the next day instead of dying in my notes.\n\nWorks with facebook, instagram, tiktok, X, youtube, linkedin, threads, bluesky, and pinterest.\n\nPublished it on ClawHub if anyone wants to try: `clawhub install postfast`\n\nYou can just get an API key at [PostFast's](https://postfa.st) website for this to work\n\nHappy to answer anything about building skills for OpenClaw, it was honestly simpler than I expected.",

Scheduling tools solve the \"when\" but still require you to go open another app, which is where the friction actually is.\n\nCurious: do you also use it to figure out WHERE to post? That's the other half I've been thinking about a lot. I built [beampost.app](http://beampost.app) to help find the right communities for a product, but the posting/scheduling part is still manual. Your approach + something like that could be a pretty solid combo.\n\nHow's the PostFast API to work with? Thinking about whether it'd make sense to add scheduling as a next step after community discovery.",

      "text": "Alright, here is a quick tutorial on how to be better with AI as I see some comments made here and people take all this effort to set up the bot and then just f off into the distance.\n\nWe run a social media API. No account limits. Which means I see an absurd amount of content go through our system.\n\nSome of it is bad. Like objectively bad. I’ll chalk some of that up to cultural differences and move on. Some of it is actually decent. Sometimes even looks human.\n\nI talk to our clients a lot because thats how you build partnerships and just asked around what they are doing and how. They understand that If I were to steal their busisnes I woudl did that already.\n\nRoughly:\n\n* \\~25% of the good stuff is written by actual humans\n* the rest is AI, but conditioned on the user\n* about half uses custom-trained models\n* the other half is just GPT behind a decent wrapper\n\nThe common thing for the GPT wrappers is that they all pass a brand voice file  at the start of each session.\n\nNot a “tone: friendly” prompt.  \nAn actual config that tells the model how the brand talks, what it avoids, how it structures things, what words are banned, etc.\n\nI asked a few clients how they do it, merged a couple of their setups, and cleaned it up so it’s reusable. You can pick what you want and delete the rest.\n\nHow to use it?  \nI’m not your mom. Play with it.\n\nIf you’re an agency, the obvious move is:  \ntalk to the client, steal their stories, weird phrases, strong opinions, dump that into the XML. Output improves immediately.\n\nThere’s a smaller version below.  \nFull version is on the blog. No signup, no paywall, just copy-paste.\n\nLink:  \n[https://info.bundle.social/blog/how-to-create-ai-brand-voice-xml](https://info.bundle.social/blog/how-to-create-ai-brand-voice-xml)\n\nIf you want to give something back, click around the blog and read something.

Then formalize those into the config.\n\n  \nThe banned words list is underrated. Removing 'delve' and 'tapestry' alone makes such a difference. Have you experimented with industry-specific banned words? For developer tools, banning phrases like 'revolutionary' or 'disrupt' has been more impactful than I expected.\n\n",

The anxiety of not knowing what a bill will be is a real churn driver.\n\n  \nThat said, there is a middle ground that works well. Show a clear pricing page with per-geography rates, and then in the API response include a cost field on each transaction. Something like \"cost\\_usd\": 0.003 right in the response body. Users who care can track it, users who do not can ignore it.\n\n  \nTwilio does this well. Every API response includes price and price\\_unit fields. Stripe shows per-transaction fees broken down on every charge. Nobody complains that it \"complicates\" billing because it is opt-in info. You only see it if you look.\n\n  \nThe complication concern is usually about the pricing page, not the API itself. Keep the pricing page simple with a few tiers or a calculator, and let the API be the source of truth for power users who want granular data.\n\n  \nOne thing to watch out for: if you change pricing by geography, make sure your API returns the actual rate applied at the time of the transaction, not a current-rate lookup.

      "text": "I run TubeScout, a solo project that sends daily email digests with summaries of new YouTube videos from channels you follow. You pick the channels, and every morning you get an email with the key takeaways so you don't have to watch everything.\n\nRight now I have about 40 users total. 6 of them are paying founding members at $3/mo ($18 MRR). The rest are on a free tier that gives them 3 channels and 30 summaries per day.\n\nHere's what I'm planning to do and I'd love a gut check, especially on the pricing and whether the free trial will eat my margins.\n\n**The change:**\n\nI want to move from \"free forever + one paid tier\" to a 3-tier system with a 7-day free trial:\n\n* Basic: $3/mo (20 channels, 3 summaries/day)\n* Pro: $7/mo (60 channels, 20 summaries/day)\n* Premium: $12/mo (150 channels, 40 summaries/day)\n\nNew users get a 7-day trial with Pro-level access (60 channels, 20 summaries). After that they either subscribe or lose access to summaries (their channel selections stay saved).\n\nExisting free users get 1 week notice, then they're moved to the expired state too. Founding members ($3/mo) stay grandfathered.\n\n**The cost situation:**\n\nEach summary costs me about $0.006-0.007 in Gemini API fees. So the per-user monthly cost at full daily usage:\n\n* Basic (3 summaries/day x 30 days): \\~$0.63/mo. Margin: 79%\n* Pro (20/day): \\~$4.20/mo. Margin: 40%\n* Premium (40/day): \\~$8.40/mo. Margin: 30%\n\nThose margins assume every user maxes out their quota every single day, which won't happen in practice. But Premium at 30% margin feels tight.\n\n**What I'm worried about:**\n\n1. **Trial abuse eating margin.** Every new signup gets 7 days of Pro-level access for free. If people sign up, use it for a week, then bounce, I'm paying for their summaries and getting nothing. Is a 7-day trial too generous for a $3-12/mo product?\n2. **Are the limits right?** 3 summaries/day on Basic feels low but the price is also low ($3). 20 on Pro feels solid. 40 on Premium... is anyone actually going to need 150 channels and 40 summaries per day?\n3. **Killing the free tier.** Right now free users get 3 channels with full summaries. After the switch, there's no free option at all (just the 7-day trial). Part of me thinks free users are a waste since they cost money and rarely convert. But another part thinks removing free entirely might hurt discoverability and word of mouth.\n\nFor context, my founding members have been paying $3/mo for what's essentially the current Pro tier (100 channels, 30 summaries). So the new Basic tier at $3/mo is actually less than what founders get, which makes me think $3 is fair for the entry point.\n\nHas anyone here gone through a similar pricing change? Especially curious about:\n\n* Is 7-day trial the right length for this type of product?\n* Should I keep a limited free tier instead of killing it entirely?\n* Do the margins look healthy enough or am I underpricing?\n\nThanks for reading this far. Happy to answer any questions about the setup.",

If someone actually uses 40 summaries daily, you're making $3.60/month and praying they don't churn. Either raise it to $15 or cap it at 30 summaries. You need room to survive your own success.\n\nBasic at 3/day is borderline useless. Make it 5. The extra $0.30 in cost won't hurt you and it's the difference between \"I guess this works\" and \"okay I actually want this.\"",

Your real risk right now is obscurity, not margin erosion from free riders.\n\n  \nThat said, a few things jumped out:\n\n  \nYour Premium tier is underpriced. 30% margin at full usage is basically break-even once you factor in infrastructure, support time, and any API price changes. Either bump it to $15-18/mo or lower the limits. You want at least 50% margin on your most expensive tier because your heaviest users are also the ones who email you the most.\n\n  \n7 days is the right trial length for a daily habit product. Your value compounds over time (the more channels someone adds, the stickier it gets). 7 days gives them enough mornings to build the routine. Shorter trials work for tools you use once and decide, but yours needs repeated use to click.\n\n  \nKilling the free tier is fine at your scale. With 34 free users who havent converted after however long theyve been on, the odds they ever will are close to zero. The one thing I would keep is a degraded free experience after the trial ends, something like letting them see channel names and titles but not summaries. That way they still get the reminder of what they are missing every day without costing you API calls.\n\n  \nOne thing to watch: dont grandfather your founding members forever. $3/mo for what is now Pro-level access will feel increasingly wrong as you grow. Give them a generous runway (6 months, a year) then migrate them to whatever tier matches their usage at a discount. They will understand.",

There’s no real push to upgrade. You end up supporting a lot of free users without clear upside.\n\nI’ve personally found that a time-limited trial tends to work better, especially if users get real access to the core value. It creates urgency, and more importantly, it forces them to actually try the product properly. Whether it’s 7 days or 14 days really depends on how long it takes someone to hit that “aha” moment. For some tools, 7 days feels rushed. If your product needs usage time to show value, 14 days might convert better from a pure probability standpoint.\n\nSo I don’t think it’s about free vs no free. It’s about design. Free only works if it’s structured to lead people toward becoming paying customers. Otherwise it just becomes a parking lot for non-paying users.",

Takes seconds to test.\n\nWhat usually stops you from self-hosting workflow tools? The dependency pile-up, security worries, missing nodes, or just the time sink? Real answers appreciated – this is built to cut exactly those barriers. 🚀",

              "text": "Great question. this is exactly where localized ASO usually breaks.Asogenie handles this **fully automatically**. It adapts text length, hierarchy, spacing, and layout based on the target language, including languages with long compound words like German.On top of that, there are quite a few customization options. If you make a manual design or copy adjustment, you can choose to **propagate that change to the same screenshot index across all other languages automatically**, so you don’t have to redo the same tweak per locale.This way you get full auto generation by default, but still keep global consistency when you need to step in manually.",

On your positioning question, what would make me pay is a tool that does ONE thing exceptionally well: localized screenshots at scale.\n\nMost indie devs have 2-10 apps across different markets. Manually adapting screenshots for German, Japanese, Korean etc is painful.\n\nThe macOS desktop angle is actually a differentiator. Most ASO tools are web-based which feels overkill. A lightweight app that lives in your menu bar fits the indie mindset.\n\nPricing: $49/year for unlimited projects. That is low enough to feel like a no-brainer but still meaningful. Position it as the tool you install on day one of app development.",

I think I tried to explain Asogenie too broadly instead of leaning hard into localized screenshots at scale.and you’re right — most indie devs don’t need a full ASO suite. They need something that removes the painful part: adapting visual assets per market.the macOS angle is intentional. I didn’t want another heavy web dashboard. Something lightweight, native, and always available felt more aligned with how indie builders actually work.\n\nThe $49/year positioning as a “day one install” tool is interesting — that framing might be stronger than marketing it as a generic AI utility.\n\nReally appreciate the thoughtful breakdown. This gives me a lot to refine. 🙏",

      "text": "You want full control over your workflows: private data, unlimited runs, no subscriptions, no vendor lock-in.  \n\nBut then you hit the wall — multi-service compose files, external Postgres + Redis setup, env var roulette, and \"it works on my machine but crashed on deploy.\"\n\nThat friction has stopped me from self-hosting more than once. For everyday automations (Sheet syncs, Slack bots, AI agents that actually use tools), the overhead kills the joy.\n\nSo I made the full engine behind **a2n.io** open and dead-simple to deploy yourself.  \n\nMIT licensed. No white-label forced on you. No phoning home. Your server, your rules.\n\n**One single step to get it running:**\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nThat's it.  \n\nOpen http://localhost:8080 (or your server's IP:8080), create your admin account, and start building flows immediately.\n\nEverything is embedded by default — Postgres, Redis, the works — so zero extra services or config for testing, dev, or small personal/prod use. (Want scale? Just add your own DATABASE\\_URL and REDIS\\_URL env vars later. Still easy.)\n\nWhat you get right away:\n\n\\- Familiar drag-and-drop canvas (nodes, connections, like n8n but lighter)\n\n\\- 30+ practical nodes: Webhook/Schedule triggers, Google Sheets/Slack/Notion/Telegram/Gmail/Discord/GitHub/Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok + built-in AI agents with real tool calling\n\n\\- JS/Python code nodes, HTTP/SQL, filters, loops, file handling\n\n\\- Real-time execution logs and monitoring — see exactly what's happening\n\n\\- Unlimited workflows/executions when self-hosted (no caps)\n\n\\- Data stays 100% on your machine/VPS — perfect for sensitive stuff\n\nIt's not trying to match n8n's 1000+ node ecosystem yet (growing, focused on 80/20 hits), and heavy custom scripting is lighter here. But for the flows most people actually build and run daily? This deploys fast, stays stable, and doesn't make you dread updates.\n\nI've got mine running on a cheap VPS for notification bots and AI summaries — one pull and it's up, no drama.\n\nIf you've been waiting for a self-hosted workflow tool that doesn't punish you for wanting privacy and simplicity, try that one command. Takes 30 seconds.\n\nWhat usually kills self-hosting for you — the multi-container setup, worrying about dependencies, or missing key integrations? Drop it below — this is built to fix exactly those pains. 🚀",

Influencer marketing hit $24B in 2025, but it's getting saturated. Meanwhile, 86% of consumers say brands are most trustworthy when they co-create with customers.\n\n(I’m not saying these ‘4’ types are dead, no, just the MOAT is evolving)\n\nAnd companies that personalize through co-creation see 40% more revenue growth than competitors.\n\nLEGO proved this at scale. They let fans submit and vote on product ideas. Result: 2.8 million community members, 135,000+ ideas submitted, and a $90M business line with 40% profit margins. It incentive:\n\n* cross-selling among satisfied users\n* free user acquisition\n* constant feedback\n\nNow here's what's changed: with AI, anyone can build anything. Products are a commodity. The only real moat is your audience. And the strongest audiences aren't followers. They're these active users.\n\n**So how do you actually do this?**\n\nStep 1: Own your audience through email. Not social. Not algorithms (example : a newsletter you control or just gathering email with your project)\n\nStep 2: Feature the people who engage. Interview them. Showcase them. Make them the content. Any original idea is welcomed.\n\nStep 3: Build the product that matches the value you're already giving.\n\nI'm running this with two projects right now:\n\n[StartupHunt.io](http://StartupHunt.io) that started as a newsletter. I feature founders who reply to my emails. I interview them, spotlight their projects. Now I'm building a product on top that matches the value I already bring them (not live but the principle is here)\n\n[TrustViews.io](http://TrustViews.io)**, a** directory ranking people by views. I'm launching a newsletter where I break down the strategies behind each person's traffic curve from listed people. The directory feeds the newsletter. The newsletter feeds the directory.\n\nThe framework in 3 words: **feature your users.**\n\nHave reviews? Showcase them in the newsletter.\n\nHave top performers? Interview them.\n\nHave case studies? Tell their stories.\n\nWhen your users ARE the content, you don't have a distribution problem. They share because they're in it. That’s today’s MOAT.",
