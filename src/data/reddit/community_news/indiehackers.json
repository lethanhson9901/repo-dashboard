Here’s how it works:\n\n - For every idea you add, we scan multiple real time data sources like Google ad keywords, serp and Reddit. We pull out what people are excited about, what they’re struggling with, and what they actually ask for. Then we turn it into a structured report (with links to the real posts) so you can see if it’s worth building.\n\n - Once you set it up, we keep watching Reddit for you. If someone new shows interest in your space (asks a question, complains about a tool, etc.), you get a notification. Basically, early customer discovery on autopilot.\n\n - we've also got a library of over 1.5k startup ideas mined from about 100 subs in total which you can explore",

It’s not a test, it’s not diagnostic, it simply helps Haven adapt to the user’s needs while fully respecting boundaries.\n\n\nYou can find Haven by going to https://www.prometheussys.com/ For now, it works best on a Windows laptop or desktop, but an app is coming soon!\n\n\nHaven is always evolving.

Then, I'll run a small ad campaign, even just $50-$100, to see if anyone actually clicks and converts. If I get a decent conversion rate, say above 5%, that's a good signal there's some interest.

      "text": "I see a lot of posts on here talking about how improtant it is to validate your idea and I think many founders read those posts and agree even though they haven’t properly validated their idea themselves.\n\nThe chances that you’re building something nobody wants are high especially if you’re a new founder.\n\nYou’re gonna be biased towards your idea because we all are and it’s very difficult not to be.\n\nI’ve built apps both with no demand and strong demand so I thought I would share what the difference in those experiences looked like for me.\n\nHopefully you can read this and it will help you figure out if you might be in the “risk zone” of building something nobody wants.\n\n**1. How difficult is marketing for you?**\n\nMarketing is obviously difficult and it’s the same for everyone but marketing an app that nobody wants is near impossible.\n\nI put about the same amount of effort into marketing my first app (no demand) and my current app (strong demand).\n\nAfter 5 months of marketing my first app (which was an AI form for sales people), I didn't have a single active user. I could get people to check out my landing page but VERY few signed up and practically no one used it.\n\nWhen I did marketing for my current app (product development platform) it took 2 weeks to get my first 100 users. I guess I'm a bit of an extreme example since the difference in demand was so big but still you get what I’m trying to say.\n\nIf all your marketing efforts don’t lead to any results you have likely built something nobody wants.\n\nAnd I know it’s difficult here to judge if it's just that your marketing is bad and you’re not doing enough or if your product lacks demand. A way to tell the difference is if you can get traffic to your site or not.\n\nIf you can't get traffic to your site = bad marketing\n\nIf you can and the traffic converts to users = good sign\n\nIf you can and it doesn’t convert = bad sign\n\n**2. How do people react to your product?**\n\nPeople rarely complimented my AI form or said anything close to “this is useful to me”.\n\nSince day one people have been saying how good my current idea is and how much potential they see in the product.\n\nNo one ever gave me feedback on my AI form but I get feedback all the time now. People want to get involved and help and it's been like that since I launched my MVP.\n\nI don't want this to sound like some form of bragging. I'm just trying to convey that if people aren’t hyped and excited about your product then it’s a bad sign.\n\nYou can definitely tell when people are genuinely impressed by your product and when it's more \"meh\", so this signal is pretty easy to pick up on.\n\n**3. What did the groundwork look like for you?**\n\nHow did everything start with your product? Did you try to solve a problem you experienced yourself or that you knew others experienced? Did you talk to people before building?\n\nMy first product was quite spontaneous and didn’t really solve a big problem. I wanted to build something to get better at coding and I fell in love with my product as I started building.\n\nMy goal became to make it better and better because I was proud of it, it was cool, and it looked good.\n\nMy product now came directly from a problem that was painful to me and before I started building it I spent time on the groundwork. I reached out to my target audience to understand the problem better, understand them better, and get input on my idea.\n\nIf you didn’t begin by talking to people to validate the problem and your solution then you’re definitely in the “risk zone”.\n\nIt is possible that you came up with a “million-dollar idea” just through intuition but it’s not likely.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nAccept the fact that every founder is very biased towards their own idea and will bend reality to make it fit their narrative. Also accept that you’re more likely than not one of them.\n\nEscape this bias by relying on data for your decisions, because data doesn’t lie. The data comes from doing proper market research and talking to your target audience before building.\n\nI hope this post can help some of you fall out of love with your unvalidated product.\n\np.s.

When demand is weak, even tiny friction kills adoption. In one dataset I tracked, products with strong pull still converted 12 to 18% of warm traffic despite messy onboarding. Weak pull products converted under 3% even with polished UX. Another overlooked sign is how fast feedback loops form. If you launch and within 30 days you are not overwhelmed with edge cases, requests and weird usage patterns, that is usually not a good sign. Real demand creates operational chaos early. That is where having systems matters. I use Runable to break user flows into granular steps and map failure points because once traction hits, manual patching collapses fast. Demand shows up in behavior, not compliments.\n\n",

A lot of us hide behind “I’m building fast” when really we are avoiding uncomfortable conversations with potential users. Talking to people before building feels slow, but rebuilding after five months of crickets is way slower.\n\nCurious, with your first app, at what point did you know deep down it was not working but kept going anyway?

No urgency, no budget, no calendar access = walk away.\n\nAlso worth tracking two numbers: % of cold traffic that signs up, and % of signups that come back unprompted within a week. Those tell you a lot faster than vanity metrics.\n\nTools like Sparktoro, Beehiiv sponsor swaps, and Pulse for Reddit make it way easier to actually find and talk to those early users instead of building in a vacuum.\n\nMain point: if you can’t get money, time, or recurring usage, the market already gave you your answer.",

Same with interviews: 50+ sounds like a lot until you block 2 hours a day and just grind through them for 3 weeks.\n\nI’d add one step between “build before you scale” and “quit early”: predefine your win/kill metrics before you ship. Stuff like: 10 real users, 3 paid in 7 days, or I pivot the offer or channel.\n\nOn tools, I’ve leaned on things like Lemlist and LinkedIn for outbound, tried F5Bot and Mention for problem discovery, and Pulse for Reddit to catch live pain-point threads where people basically hand you copy and channel fit.\n\nMain point: one channel, one offer, strict rules, then either double down or let it die fast.",

Another can post the same volume and hit 1K MRR in 30 days because their ICP already lives there and feels the pain. In 20 early stage launches I reviewed, the ones that crossed 1K MRR fastest had three things. Clear ICP narrow enough to describe in one sentence. A painful use case with weekly frequency. And a channel where that ICP was already gathering. Also the 48 hour ship rule works only if the problem is urgent. Some B2B products need 30 to 60 day sales cycles. Killing them in 7 days creates false negatives. The real common thread is speed of feedback loops. Short loops win. Long silent loops kill.\n\n\n\n",

If they’re legitimately optimizing that many resumes, they might be a career coach or a recruiter using your personal plan for professional work. That’s a huge opportunity to spin off a higher-tier 'Pro' or 'Agency' plan.\n* Usage Caps: You might want to look into a 'fair use' policy for the unlimited tier. Most 'unlimited' plans have a soft cap just to prevent edge cases like this from nuking the margins.\n\nCongrats on the traction, though.

So here it is.\n\nThis is the design. Not a mockup of a wishlist, these are the actual screens I'm shipping for the AWS Competition prototype.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3t57kx5pu8lg1.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=3abe9d76afb08a0c086c5d08de87a4a9e36fc309\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/avg69zhru8lg1.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b7366ac3ec332894f751f6f347c93f9accb6b38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2d7x7hnsu8lg1.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f7cdb8ba1479066079b7ab99321ebd99b74f7b\n\nThe core idea: you ask Cirrondly a question about your AWS costs in plain English. It connects to your account, finds exactly what's wasting money, and lets you fix it in one click.\n\nNo Cost Explorer. No charts. No DevOps degree required.\n\nThe diagnosis screen above? That's an AI agent that found $1,120/month in savings across 3 services in under a minute. Idle EC2 instances running at 2% CPU. 1.5TB of unattached EBS storage. Outdated snapshots. All real waste, all fixable.\n\nThe \"Shut down instance / Keep running\" screen is my favorite. Because that's the moment that matters: the agent found something, explained it clearly, and now you decide. No meetings, no graph that explains everything and nothing, no need for a tutorial or an expert. No digging through consoles. For me, this is the disconnect button the cloud always needed.\n\n17 days left. The product isn't live yet but the waitlist is open: [cirrondly.com](http://cirrondly.com).\n\nIf you're burning money on AWS and want early access, drop a comment or DM me. I'm giving the first 10 people free access when I ship\n\n",

I was the CTO who had to do everything. Then, when I was CTO, I saw the founder who wanted to make an investment call and didn't know how to calculate how much he would spend on 10 clients.\nThen there's the axis of personal experience: how painful it is to spend a lot of money because you left something connected and forgot about it, or simply don't know how to set up cost alerts.\nThen there's the question of asking. I created an account on X, posted for several months, and someone told me they had that pain when they logged into AWS Cost. I found it understandable. I was building something and wanted to spend less.\nThe last two are validation by searching how many people have complained about surprise bills.",

That decision tree you're solving for founders is actually a significant problem.\n\n\n\nSo many founders burn through runway chasing DevOps optimization instead of revenue. The fact that you made it a simple UX problem—\"here are your savings, approve to execute\"—removes the friction that keeps people in analysis paralysis.\n\n\n\nWith 17 days of runway, I'd also focus on:\n\n\\- Landing page CTR/conversion metrics (can you validate demand before full launch?)\n\n\\- Early cohort retention (do the first 10 users stick around after day 7?)\n\n\\- Cost-per-acquisition vs. LTV projections (helps set pricing quickly)\n\n\n\nThe AI diagnosis is your lead magnet. If you can get 100 founders to see $1,000+ in potential savings, even 10% conversion at $20-50/month gets you profitable fast. Good luck with the final sprint!",

Warm intros beat any amount of posting. Also, you learn the language they use, which makes your onboarding and copy instantly better.\n\nWe’re now talking to a psychology school about using it as a practice tool for trainees.

          "text": "This is not a bad idea, actually. Especially for a marketplace like this, where supply and demand tend to form a long-term, \"monogamous\" relationship, which has a high risk of disintermediation, which is the biggest threat to commission-based models in this space: once the pet owner trusts a sitter, they just text them directly and the platform loses both of them. A subscription model sidesteps that entirely because you're not taxing each transaction.\n\nI don't know if they still do it, but UrbanSitter, a marketplace for babysitters, used to charge a subscription from both the providers and the customers. Worth looking into how they structured it. I co-wrote a pretty good article on all the different ways to marketplace monetize: [https://www.sharetribe.com/academy/how-top-100-marketplaces-monetize/](https://www.sharetribe.com/academy/how-top-100-marketplaces-monetize/)\n\nThe catch is that this only works if you can deliver enough demand. If sitters are paying $15-29/mo but not getting bookings through your platform, they'll churn fast. And that's probably your biggest hurdle right now. Marketplaces live or die on liquidity: your ability to match supply and demand reliably. Without that, you're just a booking tool nobody's booking through. So you have to deal with the #1 problem for marketplace: chicken and egg or cold start problem.\n\nTo deal with that, realize your marketplace has a strong local component. A pet sitter in Austin doesn't help a dog owner in Boston. So I'd recommend starting hyperlocal. Like, your own neighborhood or zip code. Saturate one small area with both sitters and pet owners before expanding. Practically every successful local marketplace did this, including Airbnb (started in SF during conference season) and Uber (one city at a time). It's tempting to launch broadly, but thin coverage everywhere is worse than deep coverage somewhere.\n\nu/gaiaom's feedback is also worth taking seriously. They're an actual pet sitter (right?) saying they wouldn't pay a subscription. That might mean you charge the demand side instead (pet owners pay for access to vetted sitters), or it might mean you need a generous free tier that gives sitters enough value before asking them to pay. Either way, always good to listen to the people doing the work.",

      "text": "As a solo founder, I kept hitting the same wall: I wanted quick, private automations to handle repetitive stuff (like syncing leads from Sheets to CRM, queuing daily posts to X, or AI agents summarizing feedback to Slack). \n\nThese could save me hours every week, but the setup for self-hosted tools always turned into its own massive chore.\n\nI'd get excited, spin up a container, then spend evenings fighting compose files, external DB configs, volumes that wouldn't persist properly, and updates that broke things silently. The **automation solution** ended up creating more overhead than the manual work I was trying to escape. Ideas piled up in \"someday\" tabs, and I stayed stuck doing things by hand.\n\nThe insight that hit me: most of us don't need infinite customization in the hosting layer. We need something reliable, private, and low-friction – so the focus stays on building flows, not babysitting servers.\n\nThat's why I started shaping a2n.io into a self-host friendly version: one pre-built Docker image with everything embedded (Postgres + Redis), no extras required to get going. Kept it MIT licensed, no forced white-label or branding – deploy it anywhere (local machine, VPS, your choice).\n\n**Repo with the latest docs**: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\n**The deploy step that made it feel simple**:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\n**Docker pulls the image, starts the container, persists your data in the volume**.  \n\nOpen http://localhost:8080, set your admin password – drag-and-drop builder ready in under a minute.\n\n**Upgrades are seamless**:  \n\n```bash\n\ndocker pull sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\ndocker stop a2n && docker rm a2n\n\n# re-run the docker run command above\n\n```\n\nYour workflows, credentials, and history stay safe in the volume – no data wipe, no manual migrations for most updates. Takes 20 seconds, zero surprises.\n\nWhat I'm running now:\n\n\\- Visual drag-and-drop canvas  \n\n\\- **110+ nodes** covering everyday needs: Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok agents with tool calling, HTTP/SQL, JS/Python code, webhooks, schedules, files  \n\n\\- Real-time execution logs & monitoring  \n\n\\- Unlimited workflows and executions (no caps)  \n\n\\- One-click n8n flow migration (paste your JSON export – converts and runs with warnings for adaptations)  \n\n\\- Horizontal scaling (main + worker containers via compose, auto-discovery in cluster)  \n\n\\- Vertical scaling (CPU/mem limits, concurrent executions, pool sizes adjustable from UI System Monitor)  \n\n\\- Auto schema upgrades and migrations on pull  \n\nIt's not about matching every niche node out there – it's focused on the practical 80/20 that lets indie founders ship fast without the tinkering tax turning into its own project. Less overhead, more shipping.\n\nVery early days for the self-host side (repo got recent updates with scaling and migration features), but if you've felt that \"tool to save time creates more time sink\" loop, give that one command a quick test. Low risk, quick to spin up.\n\nAnyone else been in that cycle where the automation tool itself becomes the bottleneck? What's your biggest self-host frustration right now – setup complexity, upgrade pains, or something else? Sharing because those exact issues pushed me to keep simplifying. 🚀",

      "text": "I built a free Chrome extension (Thrive Tab) that turns a new tab into a simple board of the links you use all day (think: a clean kanban-style board of shortcuts, locally stored so it's instant access).\n\nThe funny part is: I didn’t start with a product, I started with a static web page for myself, because I kept reopening the same sites every day.\n\nThen I packaged it as a Chrome extension to make managing it easier, and the first real growth came from a loop I didn't plan:\n\nMy sister saw it and asked for it. People at her work saw it during screen shares / in person and asked \"what is that?\" They installed it too, and then it spread the same way.\n\nSo the product seems to \"sell itself\" once someone sees it, but people don’t naturally search for \"new tab link dashboard\" as a category.\n\nMy question: how would you turn this visual / workplace copy loop into a repeatable acquisition channel without spamming and without a sales team?\n\nSpecifically, I'd love advice on:\n\nHow would you recreate the \"someone saw it\" moment online?\n\nHow else can I grow this?\n\nIf you were me, what would you do in the next 2 weeks to get the first 1,000 real users?\n\nIf you want to see it, here's the link to the Google Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/thrive-tab-instant-access/gpjonhpjbklemamfojblbiilommammfk (happy for any feedback, I'm just getting started here)",

If you ever hit the point where people start churning, a tool like InsightLab can help you mine those “why I removed it” moments so you’re not just guessing what to fix while you stare at your own kanban like it’s a modern art piece.",

So recreate the screen-share moment at scale. Post short 10–20 second screen recordings on LinkedIn and X showing your actual messy workday before/after. Title it around productivity, not “new tab dashboard.” “How I save 15 minutes every morning” will outperform feature talk. Add a tiny, tasteful watermark or corner badge so every screenshot or Loom naturally advertises it. That turns every shared screen into distribution.\n\nIn the next 2 weeks I’d focus on three numbers: daily active users, installs per active user, and share clicks per install. If fewer than 10–20% of users trigger a share, the loop isn’t strong enough yet. Add frictionless sharing like “duplicate my setup” links for teams. Also target remote teams and startup communities where screen sharing happens constantly. Tools like this grow in clusters, not randomly. Seed 10 teams of 20 instead of chasing 1,000 individuals.",

That actionability threshold seems to be universal across SaaS.\n\n\n\nFor voice especially, I'd also track:\n\n\\- Repeat usage within 24 hours (does the voice interface become habitual?)\n\n\\- Average actions per session (is the friction so low they keep adding more tasks?)\n\n\\- App reconnects (how many integrations does a power user connect?)\n\n\n\nThe fact that users are triggering real actions, not just testing the novelty, means you're past the cool-factor chasing and into actual utility.

At one point I had a 93% drop off in my product during the activation stage because users weren't finding value fast enough - as soon as they saw value within the first 60 seconds we saw repeat usage, longer sessions, and higher conversion rates.   \n  \nYour 2+ cross-app actions threshold seems critical. I'd add one cut to the data: how long does it take your best users to hit it? Analyze the actions of your highest-retained users and see how long it takes for them to reach that threshold. For churned users, does it take them longer? Why? What do they do instead? What's different about them specifically? That gap is your roadmap.\n\nCongrats and good luck! ",

A lot of founders I know lose to competitors just because they spent an extra week on features instead of getting v1 out in 48 hours.\n\n\n\nAlso the \"don't waste months\" part - this is crucial.

Upvotes mean visibility. Visibility means traffic. So I scraped and analyzed 15,000 launches to find the pattern.\n\nA few weeks ago, I joined a hackathon. 26 participants. We voted and gave each other real feedback. No filters, no politeness tax.\n\nI finished 4th.\n\nThe feedback hit different. These were strangers who could be my actual audience. They didn't know me, so they told me the truth. And the truth was: the best ideas don't come from solo research. They come from outside perspective.\n\nThat changed everything.\n\nStartupHunt used to be my research. Me finding startup ideas worth copying, writing them up, sending them out.\n\nNow, I’m going to interview founders who hit a real revenue milestone (only founders listed on TrustMRR, so you know they're legit). And I ask them one thing: what was the one move that got you there?\n\nNot \"how do you approach distribution.\" Not generic advice. One specific play that actually worked.\n\n**Why this matters more in 2026**\n\nAI changed the game fast. You can ask any chatbot for startup growth advice and get a clean answer in 5 seconds.\n\nBut clean isn't the same as real.\n\nWhat I'm building is a co-created library of startup growth plays. Real founders. Real moves. Things that worked once and can work again with the right context.\n\nThat's something ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude can't give you. They search the surface. This is the underground.\n\nMy business turn:\n\nFounders get featured. The audience grows. More founders want in. The library gets deeper.\n\n300+ subscribers already. Shared on X, Reddit, and LinkedIn. Videos coming.\n\nIf you've hit a revenue milestone and have one specific play that moved the needle, reply to this email.\n\nWe'll get into the DMs. I'll feature you on [**startuphunt.io**](https://startuphunt.io/).\n\nthe hackathon : [kaijubeam.com](http://kaijubeam.com)\n\nI got inspired a lot by starterstory (he sold his business a few weeks ago)",

Ideas stayed in \"someday\" tabs forever.\n\nSo I started building the opposite approach for a2n.io:\n\nA low-code/no-code workflow builder that deploys and scales with minimal friction – focused on shipping fast, not infra tinkering.\n\nLatest self-host version: one pre-built Docker image with everything embedded (Postgres + Redis), MIT licensed, no forced white-label/branding. Deploy anywhere: local, VPS, your cloud.\n\n**Repo (check horizontal.yml, scaling guide, changelog)**:  \n\nhttps://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\n**One-step deploy:**\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\n\\- Docker pulls & starts  \n\n\\- Open http://localhost:8080  \n\n\\- Set admin password  \n\n\\- Drag-drop builder ready in <60 seconds\n\n**Seamless upgrades:**\n\n```bash\n\ndocker pull sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\ndocker stop a2n && docker rm a2n\n\n# re-run the docker run command\n\n```\n\n\\- Data stays safe in volume  \n\n\\- Schema upgrades/migrations auto-handled  \n\n\\- 20 seconds, zero surprises\n\nWhat I'm running today:\n\n\\- Visual drag-and-drop canvas  \n\n\\- **110+ nodes** covering real use cases:  \n\n  \\- Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio  \n\n  \\- OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok agents with tool calling  \n\n  \\- HTTP, SQL, JS/Python code nodes, webhooks, schedules, files  \n\n\\- Real-time execution logs & monitoring  \n\n\\- Unlimited workflows & executions  \n\n\\- One-click n8n flow migration (paste JSON export → converts & runs with warnings)  \n\n\\- Horizontal scaling (main + worker containers via compose, auto-discovery)  \n\n\\- Vertical scaling (CPU/mem limits, concurrent executions, pool sizes from UI System Monitor)  \n\nIt's not about having 1000+ niche nodes.  \n\nIt's about the 80/20 that lets indie founders actually ship automations without the hosting becoming a second product.\n\nLess tinkering. More building.\n\nVery early self-host path (recent repo updates added scaling & migration features).  \n\nIf you've felt the **automation tool creates more overhead than it removes** loop, give that one command a spin. Takes a minute to test.\n\nWhat's the biggest self-host friction you've hit lately – setup complexity, scaling, migrations, or upgrade surprises?  \n\nSharing because those exact pains drove every simplification here. 🚀",

It is so easy to lose an entire week just fighting with database persistence or Docker networking instead of actually refining your business logic. Focusing on a single pre-built image with everything embedded is a huge win for anyone who needs to ship fast and stay lean. I really like that you are keeping it MIT licensed as it makes the tool much more accessible for early stage projects that are just trying to find their footing.",

The moment you add workers + queues + retries + migrations you’re basically maintaining infra, not shipping workflows. I’ve seen solo founders lose 6 to 8 hours just debugging volumes after a minor Docker update. That wipes out the whole save 5 hours a week promise real quick. The embedded Postgres + Redis angle is actually strong because most breakages happen at the external dependency layer, not the workflow layer. Guardrails matter though. Once people chain 8 to 12 AI nodes, token burn can spike fast. If one node averages 1k tokens per run and you’re running 500 executions a day, that’s 500k tokens daily before retries. Add looping or parallel branches and costs double without anyone noticing. I’d surface per workflow token usage, cost per execution, and failure rate in a dead simple dashboard. Same for concurrency controls, race conditions usually show up when two branches write to the same resource without locking. If you can make scaling predictable, like clear worker to throughput ratios and execution per minute benchmarks on X CPU and Y RAM, that’s way more compelling than just saying horizontal scaling supported. Self host tools win when they remove uncertainty, not when they add more power.",

The $5/mo I save by self-hosting isn't worth the hours lost to \"but it should just work.\"\n\nYour Docker setup looks solid though - embedding Postgres + Redis is exactly the kind of \"it just works\" that actually saves indie founders time.",

It is not the first deploy that kills you. It is the random Tuesday when something breaks quietly and you lose half a day tracing logs instead of building.\n\nOne thing I would push on though is how many people actually want to self host versus just saying they do for control reasons. In practice, a lot of solo founders just want reliability and low cognitive load.\n\nCurious what percentage of your early users are choosing Docker over a managed option, and whether the pain is truly hosting complexity or just over engineered workflows in general.",
