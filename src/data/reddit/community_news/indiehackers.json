Ignore the noise. Some people criticize just to feel smart. That’s not signal.\n2. Build smaller circles instead of shouting into the void. This thread proved that real conversations still exist.\n3. Validation is not “this is a great product”. Validation is **“I’m paying for this.”**\n4. Focus on benefits, not features. Nobody buys features.\n\nAnd today something small but important happened:  \n**my first user entered their card.**  \nIt’s just one person, but it feels more real than a thousand compliments.\n\nSo today, I’m shipping.  \nI’m launching **KironX** on Product Hunt with a much clearer mentality: listen, validate, repeat.\n\nIf anyone here feels like checking it out or supporting, I’d really appreciate it.  \nI’ll share the Product Hunt link in the comments.\n\nThanks again to everyone who took the time to reply to my previous post.  \nThis community genuinely helped me move forward.\n\nTime to face the world.",

That's real validation.\n\nI actually launched on Product Hunt as well, and my experience was… very different 😅  \nDidn't manage to get many views at all. The noise there is unreal.\n\nSome new launches had 60–70 upvotes within minutes, which honestly felt off. My launch dropped past position 50 almost immediately, so it wasn't even visible anymore. At that point, it feels less like discovery and more like a popularity/farming game.\n\nWhat I did take away though aligns a lot with what you said:\n- One real user > hundreds of anonymous upvotes  \n- Conversations and feedback matter way more than leaderboard position  \n- PH can help, but it's not the signal people think it is - especially early on\n\nSo yeah, even if PH didn't work out for me, shipping still mattered. Learning still mattered. And that one person willing to pay is worth more than trending for an hour.\n\nRooting for your launch - and your mindset here is 100% the right one.  \nListen -> validate -> repeat",

Learned a ton from user conversations but the one thing I still can't figure out is distribution.\n\nI did the build in public thing. Twitter posts, progress updates, the whole routine. It got me some initial eyeballs but never converted into real traction. Maybe I was doing it wrong. Maybe I was talking to the wrong people. Not sure.\n\nNow I'm building something new. A platform where you can prompt to generate motion graphics videos. You can upload assets, drop in image references for inspiration, and it generates the video. Planning to add video to video generation later.\n\nI actually use this myself. I could never crack motion graphics with traditional tools. This finally works for me. So I know the problem is real, at least for people like me.\n\nBut here's where I'm stuck again.\n\nHow do I find the right channels this time? I don't want to just spray and pray on Twitter again. I want to be more intentional about where I show up.\n\nHow do I know when I've actually found my ICP? With my last products I thought I knew who I was building for but the people who signed up were completely different from who I expected.\n\nFor those who figured out distribution as an indie hacker, what actually worked? Not the stuff that sounds good in theory but what actually moved the needle for you?\n\nAppreciate any honest takes.",

Shipping was never my problem either, it was always getting clarity on why people didn’t convert once they landed.\n\nOne thing I learned the hard way is that distribution and ICP get a lot clearer when you watch real people use the product cold. In my case, I thought I knew who it was for, but first-time users kept getting stuck, hitting edge cases, or interpreting things differently than I expected. That mismatch killed conversion way more than channel choice.\n\nLately I’ve been doing short product vibe tests for founders to surface trust issues, UX friction, and early edge cases before trying to scale distribution. It’s helped sanity-check ICP assumptions without spray-and-pray posting.\n\nIf it’s useful, happy to take a quick look at yours. This is what I’m working on: [breakmy.app](http://breakmy.app)\n\nCurious though, who actually used your last products versus who you thought you were building for?",

You should still create lower-effort \"build in public\" posts on X so that you can engage with a couple of other builders on X, but this is not where your traffic will come from. When you're early, you should fully focus on cold outreach. Find your target audience (either X, Reddit, LinkedIn etc.) and send them cold DMs. This starts 1:1 conversations which help you build relationships, validate your message and offer, get qualitative feedback and ask for testimonials. This is how you get your first paying customers and how you get real signals that you can use to improve your product and offer, and narrow down your ICP.\n\nIf you're having trouble finding your ideal ICP, you can use Bazzly which will find and reach out to your target audience on Reddit.",

Ask what they use now, what frustrates them, if they'd pay for your solution.

          "text": "Distribution, for many teams, isn't a channel problem. It's a testing volume problem. the algorithm updates constantly and if you post once a day for a few weeks you will only see minimal traction and conclude distribution is hard. But that is because people underestimate the volume required to stay relevant in 2026. most founders our team has worked with have never run enough experiments to actually learn what works for their specific product and audience.\n\nFor a motion graphics tool, TikTok, Instagram Reels, and Facebook are where I'd focus. Short before/after transformations perform extremely well for creative tools. Something like \"I can't use After Effects so I built this\" grabs attention.\n\nYour founder story is great for building connection and getting people to care about you BUT what actually drives conversions is other people showing up on camera talking about your product. Real users explaining how it solved their problem. That's what gets people to buy. (of course you love your product, youre the founder! people want to see what everyday users have to say)\n\nThink about it this way. Research shows it takes somewhere between 7 to 13 touchpoints before someone makes a purchase decision. Most people see your product once, think \"that's cool,\" and forget about it. You need to keep showing up in their feed through multiple pieces of content from multiple angles before they actually convert. Same for sales systems are founded upon this as a lead goes through the funnel. \n\nStop guessing and start tracking. When you get signups, ask two questions. What do you do? And what were you trying to solve when you found us? The patterns will emerge fast.\n\nYou said the people who signed up for your last products were different than expected. That's actually useful data. What were they? That might tell you something about where to look now.\n\n**We have worked with over 50+ brands and the only thing that will turn your socials into revenue is UGC in mass VOLUME and ITERATION**. The founders we work with see a huge increase in MRR because  our distribution isn't running 10 experiments: we're running 600-1500 experiments monthly. of course, that is alot for a founder to do but you can take the lesson:\n\nyou want to be making as much diversified content as possible: Different hooks, different formats, different creators, different audiences. You need to treat marketing as systematic testing until you find what converts, then you double down hard on the winners.\n\nThe hook piece is especially important. You can have the same product, same creator, same platform, but swap the hook and get completely different results. \"Watch me make a logo animation\" versus \"I failed at After Effects for 3 years until I tried this\" will perform totally differently even if they show the same thing.\n\nAnd when something works, don't move on. Scale it. If a certain angle or format or creator style is getting traction, run more variations of that. Most people find one thing that works and then go try something new instead of milking the winner.\n\nGet real users making content about your tool. Even just 5 or 10 people posting honest reviews about how they use it will outperform you posting founder updates every day. That social proof stacks up and hits people multiple times from different voices.\n\nWhat's your current content output look like? And who were those unexpected signups from your previous products?",

For motion graphics, that’s often Discords, subreddits, YouTube comments, Gumroad audiences, Notion/Canva power users — not “startup Twitter.”\n* **ICP clarity usually shows up in behavior, not demographics.** When someone signs up and *immediately* uses it without hand-holding, that’s a signal. Double down on those people, even if they’re not who you imagined.\n* **One channel > many.** Pick one place where you can be genuinely useful (sharing workflows, tearing down videos, recreating effects) and show up consistently. If it converts even a little, you’re onto something.\n\nAlso: the fact that *you* use it is a good start — now find 5–10 people who look nothing like founders and see if they stick. Distribution gets easier once usage is obvious.\n\nCurious to see how this evolves.",

The \"free work\" offers are usually win-win when approached correctly - the person offering gets portfolio pieces and real-world experience, the person receiving gets free help with something they'd otherwise pay for or skip entirely.\n\nThe catch most people miss: you get what you scope. If you approach these with \"can you review my landing page,\" you'll get surface-level feedback. If you approach with \"here's my landing page, my target customer is X, my main CTA is Y, I'm seeing Z% bounce rate - what's not working?\" you'll get actionable insights.\n\nThe other pattern I've noticed: the people offering free work often become paid service providers later. If someone does a great job on a free automation for you, they're now a known quantity when you need paid work done. Relationship building works both ways.\n\nOne thing to watch out for - some of these offers are lead gen funnels disguised as free help. Nothing wrong with that, but worth knowing going in.",

I lost because Product Hunt is no longer a distribution channel for founders without an audience.\n\nI’ve spent weeks thinking about distribution for **KironX**, a small Chrome extension that helps filter noise on X and highlights which posts are actually worth replying to especially if you don’t have a big account.\n\nAfter days posting on Reddit and X, I had visits, installs… and **one actual conversion**.  \nSo I decided to launch on Product Hunt.  \nNot to validate the market, just to get visibility and feedback.\n\nThat’s how I *thought* Product Hunt worked.\n\n# What launch day really felt like\n\nVotes opened at 12:00 a.m. US time (≈9 a.m. in France).\n\nFour minutes in:\n\n* I had 1 vote (mine)\n* Several products already had 60+ votes\n\nThat was the first punch.\n\nI posted on LinkedIn.  \nWithin minutes, I got DMs selling upvotes:  \n“$50 for 100 votes.”\n\nThat’s when it clicked.\n\nProduct Hunt isn’t:\n\n* the best product wins\n* the best distribution wins\n\nIt’s closer to a beauty contest + paid amplification.\n\n  \n**The part people don’t talk about**\n\nI did consider cheating.  \nCrypto only. Wise transfers. No invoices. No trace.\n\nI stopped there.\n\nI decided to fight with bare hands.\n\nI kept replying on Reddit, Discord, and X.  \nI even used KironX itself to reply to live posts and say I was launching.\n\nThat part actually worked.\n\n# Real results (no hype)\n\n* Finished 35th\n* 11 installs\n* New users completed onboarding\n* Real feedback\n* A new Chrome Store review\n* \\~9 visitors came directly from Product Hunt\n\nMost DMs were either:\n\n* vote sellers\n* “security disclosures”\n\nMy real distribution still comes from X, Google, CSS Winner, and TechTrendin.\n\n  \n**What I learned**\n\nThe market is saturated. What worked 1–2 years ago doesn’t work the same today.\n\n*Mass distribution is overcrowded.*\n\nWhat *does* work:\n\n* smaller, trusted communities\n* being where your users already are\n* earning trust over time\n\nUsers who try KironX like it.  \nIt works. It helps. It doesn’t disappoint.\n\nNow the mission is clear:  \n**find the nest where your users already live.**\n\nFor KironX, that place is X itself.\n\n# Open question\n\nI’d genuinely love to hear from founders who launched on Product Hunt this year. Tell me,  \nHow did it go for you?\n\nI finished **35th**, which honestly isn’t bad given my distribution.  \nFor those planning to launch soon, these were my signals and my reality.\n\n[9 visitors from PH](https://preview.redd.it/wn8k0se9s2gg1.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=00c95df8140978230e21910e45e757c7e1a2ae30)\n\n",

All of them are way too complex for early-stage SaaS.\n\nMeanwhile, 40% of churn is just failed payments that nobody followed up on.\n\nSo I built something stupid simple: Connect Stripe, we send recovery emails, you see results in 48 hours. Free while in beta.\n\nLooking for 5 beta testers to validate this works. Free for a month.\n\nIf you're tired of paying enterprise pricing for a simple problem, let me know.\n\nComment or DM.\n\n",

      "text": "When I launched my directory, I made the classic mistake.\n\nI thought: “If the product is useful, people will just show up.”\n\nThey… did at my scale but it paid me $0.\n\nDirectories look simple from the outside.\n\n* Visibility (Traffic)\n* Backlinks (SEO)\n* Social proof via scores and rankings\n\nI started by ranking sites by their monthly views, inspired by [trustmrr.com](http://trustmrr.com), but about views/traffic : [trustviews.io](http://trustviews.io) (yes I copied it)\n\nThe first idea: charge for detailed analytics.\n\nOn paper, it made sense.\n\nIn practice, it failed.\n\nAnalytics only get valuable when you you go in details and are cheap. I was cheap but not detailed.\n\nSo I shifted.\n\nInstead of selling analytics, I turned Trustviews into a “classical” directory business model with ad slots on the side.\n\nZero meaningful clicks.\n\nSo for now, I’ve filled most of the space with affiliate links, and I’m leaving 3 out of 10 slots open.\n\nThose will be for actual sponsors later, when the traffic justifies it.\n\nThen, I talked to someone running multiple successful directories and making money out of it.\n\nHe told me everything I was doing wrong. So I’ll turn my directory into something I did not truly understood at first : paid listing.\n\nTo me it’s just slowing down growth, as less people would come in. But here is the trick :\n\n* If you want a dofollow backlink, you pay. (= I earn money & you win SEO & visibility)\n* If you don’t want to pay, you can still get listed, but you install the badge on your landing page to get that dofollow backlink. (= I earn SEO & you get visibility).\n\nThat one idea changed how I think about directories. Because indeed it’s all about what everyone get and it’s quite healthy if you ask me.\n\nThis is the other lesson:\n\nMost monetization ideas only work once you have real traction.\n\nUntil then, they’re just decoration.\n\nTo make Trustviews actually unique, I’m leaning into something different.\n\nA weekly newsletter.\n\nNot a “here are 10 tools” list.\n\nMore like:\n\n* How these projects get consistent views\n* Why traffic spikes happen\n* What strategies caused them\n* Interviews with founders behind the listings\n\nThe goal is to make the directory feel alive.\n\nNot just a wall of logos, but a community and a learning engine.\n\nIf I do this right, Trustviews becomes more than a place to dump your link.\n\nIt becomes a place where:\n\n* You understand how people actually got attention\n* Your project gets ongoing visibility, not a one-time launch\n* Readers learn distribution by watching real examples\n\nA few lessons from this whole experiment so far:\n\n1. A directory without a clear edge is just another list.\n2. Monetization has to line up with what founders actually value: backlinks, traffic, and proof they can show.\n3. Turning a directory into a media product newsletter, interviews, insights might be the real moat.\n\nThis is all still in motion.\n\nI’m earning nothing, but learning a lot, and adjusting as I go.\n\nNone of this is theory.\n\nIt’s just what I’ve tried, what failed (no actual fail), and what seems to be working.\n\nIf you run a directory, buy listings, or have ideas on better models, I’d love to hear them.\n\nReply and tell me what you’ve seen work.",

In that case newsletter is one of the hypothesis.

To put all my bets in newsletter before I actually see any signal of it working. \nWhat I wouldn’t do: if you see people are even signing up to the newsletter, track link clicks and time on page for the newsletter click. If you see some people who are actually clicking more than once in a defined time period, try to understand who they are and double down on that type of user. They might be just the segment that will join a community.\n\nMind also that retention problems usually are engagement problems - this leads to habit formation loops. If you see people joining but not engaging, check that.\n\nBottomline, I guess you need to state well what kind of product and business problem you are trying to solve. Start there and reverse engineer towards the goal depending on what you’re trying to do.",

      "text": "Here's something that's been bothering me.\n\nWhen big tech teams launch a new feature (even a small one), they spend at least a week in strategy sessions. Multiple people. War rooms. Whiteboards. Proven frameworks like SWOT analysis, Six Thinking Hats, assumption reversal. They stress-test every angle before writing a single line of code.\n\nThat's 40 hours minimum. Multiply that by 6-8 people on the team, and you're looking at 240-320 person-hours of structured thinking before execution begins.\n\nNow here's what a solo founder does (and yes, I'm guilty of this):\n\nWe get an idea. We think about it in the shower. Maybe we write down a few notes. Then we open ChatGPT: \"Is this a good idea?\" ChatGPT: \"Yes! Great market opportunity!\"\n\nTotal time invested: 30 minutes.\n\nThen we start coding. Because that feels productive. Planning feels like procrastination.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tlskaq2jkagg1.png?width=2752&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f564ccb029592939f142b422d1cb4b652ab7c06\n\n**Here's the backwards part:**\n\nBig tech can afford to fail. If a project flops, they write it off as R&D. Their risk tolerance is infinite.\n\nSolo founders cannot afford to fail. If you spend 4 months building the wrong thing, that's 4 months of savings, energy, and opportunity cost you'll never get back.\n\nYet big tech teams spend 40 hours planning. We spend 30 minutes.\n\n**The pattern I keep seeing:**\n\nBig tech borrowed startup execution speed (\"move fast and break things\"). But they kept their planning rigor.\n\nSolo founders copied the execution speed (\"just ship it\"). But we skipped the planning rigor.\n\nWe took the wrong lesson.\n\nWhen someone at a big tech company says \"just ship it,\" they're saying it AFTER a week of brainstorming with a cross-functional team. When a solo founder says \"just ship it,\" they're saying it after a shower thought and a ChatGPT chat.\n\n**\"But shouldn't I just talk to customers instead of planning?\"**\n\nYes. You absolutely should talk to customers. But here's the thing: you should do the hard thinking BEFORE those conversations, not after.\n\nIf you go into customer interviews without a clear hypothesis, without having challenged your own assumptions, you'll waste those early conversations. You won't know what questions to ask. You won't recognize when someone is being polite versus genuinely interested. And if you seem uncertain or confused about your own idea, they won't take you seriously enough to give you real feedback.\n\nThose first 10-20 potential customers are precious. They're your most valuable data source. Don't burn them by showing up unprepared.\n\nStructured thinking makes customer conversations 10x more valuable. It doesn't replace them.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\nI'm not saying you need to spend a week planning. You don't have a team of 8. You don't have infinite runway.\n\nBut you need more than 30 minutes.\n\nYou need to borrow their frameworks, not their budgets. You need to simulate the pushback a team would give you. You need to challenge your own assumptions before the market does.\n\nBecause the irony is brutal: Those who can afford to fail plan the most. Those who can't afford to fail don't plan at all.\n\n**What I do now:**\n\nI force myself to spend 2-3 days on structured brainstorming before writing code.

It still takes time to develop an MVP. If you blow two weeks building and learn it's the wrong thing, that's still slower than one week of research and planning.\n2. Whatever you decide to \"just ship\" will have a ton of assumptions built-in, and customer feedback won't necessarily help you. For example, if you build a mobile app, but your ICP really would have preferred a white-glove service, it's almost impossible to get that feedback once your mobile app has users, because they think of your product as an app.\n3. It assumes you have or can easily get customers. If you just ship and it's crickets, it's hard to figure out what you did wrong. But it's avoidable. Research and planning are the key.\n4. Brand takes years to build, but it can be destroyed in days. If you ship something that breaks or pisses off customers, word will spread. You may not care, and if the product is young enough you can even quickly rebrand. But I do think there are real long-term consequences to shipping a half-baked product.\n\nThe middle ground between \"corporate\" and \"YOLO\" is actually pretty doable. If you talk to exactly five potential users or current customers, you're getting 90% of the value of a full research project. You don't even really need frameworks to move forward from research; you will naturally identify themes, and if you discuss the feedback for a day or two, you will pull out some insights. From there you can brainstorm based on the research, and either do a second round of interviews to refine the concept, or just go ahead with one. Either way, you've significantly improved your starting point.\n\nEven in the age of vibe coding it still takes time to bang out a product, so it's a good investment.",

Indie hackers, bless us, with 20-50 customers, can ship stuff fast because the stakes are low.\n\nThat's not a luxury that big tech has, if millions or hundreds of millions are relying on your service to be consistent. So while there's definitely a lot of 'meeting bloat' and BS going on, big tech are \\*CASH COWS\\* and having a bootstrapper mentality if you're Google, doesn't work\n\nIn the same way, you'll die of overbuilding and handwringing if you try to act like an enterprise tech team when you're a tiny bootstrapped co... since you don't have that luxury :)\n\nSo it's more a matter of self assessing: \"**how much time should we spend planning and prepping and researching, based on how much we have to lose vs to gain from this?**\"\n\nThat's my heuristic from being on the receiving end of a FLOOD of bug related support tickets, because we once shipped something with a bug that hundreds of people used every day, whereas on the other hand with our apps that have 5-10 DAUs, we can afford to deploy things a little quicker\n\nOpen to disagreement from y'all here though for sure",

Here's my current process:\nI split planning into two phases: brainstorming and synthesis.\n\nPhase 1: Structured brainstorming (Day 1-2)\nI use proven frameworks to look at the idea from multiple angles. Not random thinking, but systematic:\nSix Thinking Hats: I force myself to wear each hat separately. White Hat (just the facts), Red Hat (gut feeling), Yellow Hat (why it could work), Black Hat (why it will fail), Green Hat (alternatives), Blue Hat (process check). The Black Hat is where most people skip, but it's the most valuable.\nSCAMPER: I run the idea through modification prompts. Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse. This surfaces variations I'd never think of otherwise.\nAssumption Reversal: I list every assumption the idea depends on, then flip each one backwards and defend the opposite. Half my assumptions collapse under this test.\nAs I go through these, I take structured notes. Not scattered thoughts, but organized by framework. I'm building a living document that captures the thinking process.\n\nPhase 2: Synthesis (Day 2-3)\nI take all those insights and compile them into a project brief. This has:\nProblem statement (validated, not assumed)\nProposed solution (with alternatives considered)\nTarget users (specific, not vague)\nRisks and fatal flaws (identified upfront)\nUnit economics (rough, but realistic)\nSuccess metrics (defined before building)\nThe brief becomes my source of truth. When I use Cursor or Claude or any AI tool, I paste this brief in first. It gives them context so they stop hallucinating generic solutions.\nTotal time: 4 to 6 hours spread over 2 to 3 days. Not continuous. I do a session, sleep on it, come back fresh.\nThe hard part is forcing yourself through the Black Hat when you're excited. But that's the whole point. Challenge assumptions BEFORE you're emotionally invested.\n\nDoes this help? Happy to go deeper on any specific framework.",

      "text": "Hello everyone! I am Jst Tan, currently taking a few gap months until college, and looking to make something meaningful in life, as well as make some money for college. \n\nI noticed that vibe coding is very popular at the moment. Why wouldn't it? People with non-technical skills or people with technical skills can sit back, prompt and get a website quickly and with low cost, since they do not need to hire a developer. Personally, I used it myself frequently too. \n\nHowever, many people here know that vibe coding has many disadvantages, from security vulnerabilities, a ton of bugs, AI hallucinating and much more. These can be very troublesome when they are deployed. However, although this is AI fault, it is also caused by the lack of constraints set by us. \n\n  \nWhich is why I am thinking of building a project/product where there will be: \n\n* Agent Rules \n* Agent Skills \n* AI Agents (sub-agent)\n* Website starter kit (authentication, payment, newsletter, database, analytics, premium UI components, to avoid AI creating hallucinating code) \n* Security checklist \n* Launch checklist \n* Affiliate program list \n* Website builder agent \n* Terms of Services & Privacy Policy agent \n* MCP list to enhance the AI\n\nWith all of these, we can create constraints onto AI, and enforce it to create a ready to launch website quickly without too much worries, while ensuring that AI can produce better codes together.  \n  \nI am currently considering in whether I should make this into a premium paid offering or offer it open source. I would love the opinion of the community. For those who recommended open source, I would love to hear your thoughts on how I can make a little money for college.   \n  \nI am not looking to sell or anything, just planning everything out, and I believe that with community feedback, I can make a better decision and shape a better product. Love to hear the opinion of everyone here. ",

But the list of features you mentioned is massive. Authentication, payments, UI components, legal docs, security checklists, affiliate programs... that's a lot of scope for a gap-year project.\n\nMy suggestion: pick one thing and nail it. What's the single most painful part of going from \"vibe coded prototype\" to \"actually deployed product\"? Start there. You can always expand later.\n\nOn open source vs paid: you could do both. Open source the core (builds trust, gets adoption), charge for hosted version or premium templates. Lots of indie hackers do this successfully.\n\nOne more thing: before building, talk to 10-15 people who vibe code regularly. Ask them what actually breaks for them. You might find the biggest pain point isn't what you expect.\n\nGood luck with it and props for building instead of just consuming during your gap months.",

Pick ONE.   \n  \nIf you want money for college, the \"Website starter kit\" is the fastest path. Look at ShipFast, it’s a multi-million dollar business that is essentially a high-quality starter kit. Don't build the \"AI Agent\" suite yet, build the rock-solid base that prevents the AI from hallucinating. Go for a paid offering.

      "text": "**Generating an AI video is only the first step. Resizing and upscaling usually take more time than the prompt itself. I wanted to fix that.**\n\nHey Indie Hackers!\n\nI’ve been experimenting with AI video tools for a while, but the workflow always felt broken. You’d generate a great clip in one tool, jump to another to resize it for social media (landscape to portrait), and then find a third one to upscale it so it doesn't look like a blurry mess.\n\nI built **Videai** to bridge these gaps. Instead of jumping between tabs, I implemented a **\"Flow\" feature**.\n\n**How the \"Flow\" works:** You can chain tasks together. For example: **Generate → Auto-Convert to Vertical → Upscale to 4K**. You set the sequence once, and the app handles the heavy lifting. Of course, you can still use every feature (the generator, the converter, or the upscaler) as standalone tools.\n\n**What’s under the hood:**\n\n* **Latest Models:** It’s powered by **Veo 3.1** and **Sora 2**. The realism and motion consistency in these are next-level.\n* **Ready-to-Use Templates:** For when you need a starting point or a quick creative spark.\n* **Indie-Friendly Pricing:** Since I'm in the launch phase and need your feedback, I’ve made the **credits extremely cheap**. You can test these premium models for just a few cents.\n\n**⚠️ A \"Save Your Credits\" Tip:** Sora 2 is incredibly powerful but has very strict safety filters (this is true across all platforms using it). If a prompt gets flagged, it often still consumes credits because the GPU processing starts. I’d recommend staying away from sensitive topics to make sure your credits aren't wasted!\n\nI’m looking for honest, brutal feedback. Does the \"Flow\" logic make sense for your workflow? What’s missing?\n\n**Check it out on the App Store:** [AI Video Generator : Videai](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/ai-video-generator-videai/id6754162111)\n\nI'll be in the comments to answer anything.
