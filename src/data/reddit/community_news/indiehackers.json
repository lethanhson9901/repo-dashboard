Here's how I approach balancing product development and SEO as a solo founder:\n\nProduct first:  Always prioritize building a valuable product.  That's the foundation.\n\nLaser focus SEO: Don't try to rank for everything. Pick 1-2 highly relevant keywords.\n\nBatch content: Dedicate specific blocks of time (e.g., weekends) for content creation.\n\nAI as research: Use AI tools (like Jasper or ChatGPT) for keyword research, competitor analysis, and outlining. Don't rely on them for writing the core content - that's still your expertise.\n\nLow-effort SEO: Focus on foundational SEO: title tags, meta descriptions, internal linking.\n\nDon't strive for perfection:  \"Good enough\" is often better than \"perfect\" when you're a solo founder.\n\nTrack & iterate: Monitor your traffic and adjust your strategy based on what's working.\n\nEssentially, treat SEO as a supporting function, not the primary focus.",

But your FluidCalendar win came from being in the right place at the right time with something people actually wanted.  \n  \nWith 20+ products, you're sitting on a goldmine of solutions to real problems. The challenge is connecting them to the people who need them RIGHT NOW. Some ideas: Double down on what worked - that FluidCalendar post worked, can you do more posts like it sharing the story, the tech, the journey? Pick your top 3 products and really focus distribution there since 20 products means scattered attention. Find the watering holes - for FluidCalendar it might be productivity Twitter, , indie hacker communities. Build in public more - your story is genuinely interesting, 20+ products, a viral moment, still grinding. People root for that.  \n  \nI'd love to dig into your products and help you figure out which ones have the most distribution potential. DM me if you want to chat!",

It’s not just “use the tools.” There’s an upfront tax. You have to mess around with prompts, figure out a workflow that doesn’t fight you, decide what’s worth automating and what’s better left manual. Once it clicks though, it starts compounding fast.\n\nMy setup is honestly pretty basic: Perplexity when I need quick research or a sanity check, ChatGPT for outlines and reshaping drafts, Cursor while I’m building so the product and the content move together, and n8n for the glue stuff (publishing, syncing drafts, tracking ideas, all the boring admin).\n\nSo I don’t really “balance” product vs content anymore. I try to smash them into the same loop. Build something, write as I go, ship, let automation mop up the rest.\n\nThe tools help, sure. But the real unlock was treating it like a system you design, not a pile of apps you install and hope works out.",

Then I go to Search Console and watch impressions, position, and queries. If it gets traction, I improve it. If it doesn’t, I either rewrite or leave it to die.\n\nSo the balance is the same as product work:\nship fast, measure, kill what doesn’t work, double down on what does.\n\nOverthinking SEO early is the equivalent of gold-plating features no one asked for.",

It works like a public leaderboard of startups and directories, but only with real, validated views that update live.\n\nNo edited screenshots, no made‑up metrics. The numbers on each public page come from the same script (or GA4) that powers the site’s own analytics, so what you see is what actually happened.\n\nThe main reason this exists is that founders constantly struggle with proof: some oversell their traction with nice‑looking dashboards, while others undersell it because they have no simple, credible way to showcase their real traffic.

Budgets, CPCs, or policies change and your pipeline can disappear overnight. It’s more like renting traffic than owning it.\n\nOrganic is slower, but the intent is usually higher, and the compounding effect is real. Old blog posts, Reddit threads, and niche content can keep sending leads for months or years with zero extra spend.\n\nWhat’s changed recently is AI. A lot of top-of-funnel searches are getting answered directly by AI, so generic SEO content is getting squeezed. But **problem-driven, experience-based content** (case studies, comparisons, real workflows) still performs well and is harder for AI to replace.\n\nSo for me:\n\n* Paid → validate and scale what already converts\n* Organic → build durable demand and trust\n\nPaid buys speed. Organic builds an asset.",

Last time i tried, I'd end up spending 100 and only getting 10 in return.  It just didn't stack up.  \n\nOrganic SEO on the other hand has been the engine that has driven all of our growth for past 5 years.  People searching for the phases we target are already warm and conversion rates are about 6% (new users landing to paid subscribers).  In contrast Ads never went above 1%.\n\nThat said, things have shifted since September last year, that is impacting organic  and causing us headaches.  We have been seeing a steady decline in traffic volumes, especially from google (down about 40%).  In google search console our impressions are growing, our average position is staying level, but our clicks are declining rapidly.  I can only think that this is because of the AI overviews and search users relying more and more on those.  That is making the Organic SEO even more competitive!  Rather than having to get in to the top 5 on google, now you have to be in the top 1 as that seems to be all the AI search results seem to be including in their responses.  \n\nTimes are a changing!",

What counts as “successful”\n\nLet's go straigth to the numbers, concretly: \n\n* get 2 upvotes and you are better than 50%\n* get 8 upvotes and you are better than 90%\n\nAsk your friends to support you you get to that top 10% !\n\n2. What winners have in common\n\nAcross categories, the successful ones share:\n\n* A very specific “do this one job” promise in the tagline. (in the tagline)\n* Clear audience and use case you can understand in three seconds. (in the tagline, if not description)\n* Their categories reinforce the positioning instead of trying to cover everything (max 3)\n\nIf you want more breakdowns like this, that is exactly what the newsletter goes into each week, using fresh data from startuphunt.io.​\n\n3. What the failed ones share\n\nThe low‑traction launches also share patterns, just in the opposite direction.​\n\n* Vague promises like “platform”, “solution”, or “experience” without accuracy.\n* Taglines that describe features or tech, not the outcome for a real person.​\n* Numerous categories...\n\nMany of them are not bad ideas, they are just impossible to “get” fast enough for someone scrolling past.​\n\nIf this kind of data‑driven teardown helps, this post is part of a newsletter series powered by [startuphunt.io](http://startuphunt.io), where more datasets and patterns are shared for founders.​",

One thing I'd add - even the best tagline won't convert if your landing page looks sketch or takes forever to load. First impressions are everything. I help indie hackers build clean, fast websites with Framer that match the quality of their product. If anyone's launching soon and wants their online presence to not suck, hit me up.

It’s hard to tell where clean experimentation ends and where it just turns into noisy or awkward self-promotion.\n\nIf you were approaching this as a side project:\n\n* How would you test whether a local rollout can actually grow organically?\n* What early signals would you consider meaningful (beyond installs)?\n* And at what point would you decide that the \"local density\" idea is simply not worth pursuing?\n\nCurious how others here would approach this.",

Who is the first person you approach in practice? What is the actual opener that gets you access to 15–30 people without turning it into awkward self-promotion?

So offline wins for small/medium datasets, but longer training (big CSV or Pro with NAS) heats up the phone more – that's why Lite limits epochs and we plan checkpointing + early stopping.\n\n\n\nSuper curious – what phone do you have? If you want to test the beta (APK + Docker backend) and share your battery numbers, I'd love to hear! DM me for the link.\n\n\n\nThanks again! 🚀",

The issue is rarely the tool; it’s the operating system of the business.\nMost people treat Stripe logs like a 'history book' to look at once a month, when they should be treating them like a live triage unit. If a trial expires or a payment fails, that person is at peak 'problem awareness'—waiting 24 hours to react is basically throwing money away.\n\nI see this logic a lot when I’m running validation sprints. People focus on the front-end 'sale' but have zero infrastructure to catch the people who slip through the middle.\n\nI’ve started using a Lead Scraper and Scoring Matrix approach for this exact reason. I don't care about the total number of events; I care about the 'Persona Score' of the person who just cancelled. High-value leads get a manual reach-out within the hour; low-value leads get the automated sequence.\nIt sounds like you’ve found a major 'leaky bucket' problem. \n\nAre you looking at this from a consulting angle to help businesses plug the holes, or are you trying to build an automated 'watchdog' for these events?",
