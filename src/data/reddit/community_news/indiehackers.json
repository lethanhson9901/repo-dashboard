More money = more validation. If no one's buying it, refine it.

Almost every mistake founders make is doing the right thing at the wrong time: ads before pull, investors before users, polish before proof, scale before fit.\n\nThe “do things that don’t scale” + staying employed while bootstrapping combo is especially underrated. It buys you patience, and patience is basically a superpower in the early stage. Most people don’t fail because the idea is bad, they fail because they run out of emotional or financial runway.\n\nAlso +1 on refunds and free early access. Trust compounds faster than revenue at the beginning, and people who feel treated fairly come back later. Congrats on $12k/mo, and thanks for sharing the unglamorous parts instead of a victory lap.",

But if I made it fully free, would they even value it enough to give real feedback? Classic chicken-and-egg.\n\n\\#5 and #8 also feel spot-on. I'm posting daily across TikTok, Reddit, LinkedIn, X - testing what actually converts. Zero paid ads yet because I haven't cracked organic. Feels like I'm throwing spaghetti at the wall but at least I'm learning what sticks haha.\n\nQuestion: when you kept it free at the start, how long until you switched to paid? And did you grandfather the free users or convert them?\n\nAlso curious - did you build aicofounder solo or with a co-founder (given #14)? 😄",

      "text": "I've been building software for over 15 years. Worked at Bloomberg and Shopify as an engineer, started a few companies. So when I started vibe coding with Lovable, I figured I'd skip most of the beginner mistakes. I was wrong about that.\n\nHere's what actually caught me off guard across 8 builds (affirmations app, pomodoro timer, cat of the day, dating bio rewriter, cancel plans generator, recipe app, workout timer, astrology app):\n\n**Auth is where most vibe-coded apps silently break.** Every AI tool will give you a login screen that works when you type in the right email and password. That's the happy path. But try entering wrong credentials, or sign up with a password that doesn't meet requirements, or test the Google OAuth flow when consent gets denied. Most of the time the error handling is either missing or the messages are gibberish. I spent more time fixing auth edge cases than building actual features on several of these apps. And here's the real kicker: I added a major feature to one of my apps and Lovable's model went and rewrote parts of my auth flow in the process. Suddenly nobody could log in. That regression cost me more time than the feature itself.\n\n**Meta-prompting changed my output quality overnight.** Instead of going straight to Lovable with \"build me an affirmations app,\" I started describing my product vision to Claude first and asking it to generate the Lovable prompt for me. Claude adds structure, specificity, visual design direction, page-by-page breakdowns. The difference in what Lovable produces from a meta-prompt vs. a cold prompt is dramatic. I do this for every build now.\n\n**The 90/90 problem is real.** AI gets you 90% of the way in about 90 seconds. The last 10%, error states, edge cases, polish, that's where 90% of your actual time goes. Most tutorials skip this part entirely, which is why so many people hit a wall after their first build looks great but doesn't actually hold up.\n\n**Niche apps outperform \"big idea\" apps every time.** I built a generic pomodoro timer and a pomodoro timer specifically for writers. The writer-specific one got more interest by a wide margin. Same with the workout timer. I didn't build it for gym people. I built it for people who hate the gym. The more specific your audience, the less competition you have and the more your users feel like you built it for them. Because you did.\n\n**Meme apps get traction that serious apps don't.** The cancel plans excuse generator got more attention than apps I spent significantly longer on. My take: we're in a moment where anyone can build an app in 20 minutes, so the ones that break through are the ones that make people laugh and hit share. Big companies can't afford to look ridiculous. Their brand won't let them. That makes silly apps surprisingly safe territory.\n\nThose were the big ones. Happy to get into specifics on any of these if people have questions. I've been documenting my builds so I have a lot of the details fresh.",

I spend a lot of time going through periodic code reviews and then focus sessions on removing technical debt, ensuring patters are followed etc. This is particularly important as when you go back to feature development - consistent code patterns helps the AI understand the and interact with the code structure in a predictable way. Everything has units tests that get run all the time. However now that I am well past MVP (and it's the building side I enjoy the most) - more and more time is spent on generating interest, running betas, social media, etc. I suspect this will become more and more the case as it becomes easier to build very application software.

Using Claude to write the prompt for Lovable instead of going direct is such an obvious move in hindsight but nobody talks about it. And the 90/90 point needs to be pinned everywhere, tutorials skip the part where you spend 3 hours debugging an error toast that says “undefined.”\n\nCurious about the niche angle. When the writer pomodoro outperformed the generic one, was that signups or just initial buzz? Also the meme app insight is real. Big companies literally cannot ship a “cancel plans excuse generator” without a committee losing their minds and that’s a moat even if it sounds like a joke.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Not an impressive number by startup-Twitter standards, but it covers my devops costs, AI tools, and about half of my car payment. More importantly, it’s stable and still growing month over month.\n\nWhat surprised me most is that none of this came from TikTok hype, Instagram reels, or viral launches. No big audience. No “growth hacks.” Just a boring combination of shipping consistently, fixing UX friction, listening to user complaints, and iterating for months.\n\nPeople keep saying the app market is dead, SaaS is saturated, hardware is impossible, etc. From what I’m seeing, that’s mostly noise. Revenue still compounds if you keep improving something real. Whether you’re building a mobile app, a SaaS, or even a physical product: if users are getting value and you keep showing up, the curve eventually bends upward. It’s not glamorous, but it works.\n\nI’m still iterating on my app daily, and I expect it to keep growing and not because of hype, but because people actually use it.\n\n**If you’re in a slump right now: don’t stop. This is probably the best time in history to keep building.**",

Five years ago you needed a massive team to build something meaningful, now a solo founder can ship a full SaaS product using AI, no code platforms, and cloud infrastructure that scales automatically. The barrier to entry has never been lower, which means more problems are getting solved by people who actually understand them firsthand. Are you working on anything that takes advantage of these new capabilities?",

No viral moment, no big audience. What's working: posting in Facebook groups with a genuine \"here's a problem I solved\" angle. Got 44 downloads in one day from that. Total around 85 now. No paying customers yet, but people are trying it.\n\nThe hardest part isn't building - it's the gap between \"people download it\" and \"people actually use it and pay.\" Right now I'm trying to figure out where users drop off in the setup process. Classic activation problem.\n\nYour point about \"fixing UX friction and listening to user complaints\" hits hard. That's exactly where I am - the product works, now I need to make onboarding so smooth that non-technical store owners can set it up without thinking.\n\nWhat was the turning point for you between \"people download it\" and \"people actually pay\"?",

Real signals buried in noise.\n\nBy the time I saw them, it was too late.

Got 2 paying customers, even had meetings with directors of global companies, but ultimately it is too much work to try to get customers and big companies are turned off from working with a solo founder.\n\n  \n2nd product: \"Strava for everything\". It was a social network where you can link all your APIs, e.g. Stripe, Steam, GitHub, YouTube, Chess etc and share your updates with friends. Still running, but I've stopped working on it, got about 50 signups.\n\n  \n3rd product: Helps people reduce their carbon emissions and save money. You can scan a product and it tells you lower carbon alternatives and the price difference. I did a startup programme for this at a university, got about 200 signups, some daily active users, but hard to increase retention and haven't implemented monetisation.\n\n  \n4th product: Filters your raw notification feed from X to only tell you replies that are relevant, based on your instructions. E.g. \"Only send me replies where people are asking about my product\". Saves time and prevents doomscrolling after you only went on X because someone liked your post. Started building it on Saturday, launched it on Sunday (last night). Link: [https://www.raw-bot.com/](https://www.raw-bot.com/)\n\nAfter the 3rd product, I decided that if I make another app it will have monetisation as the core feature and have it built in right away. Not \"build an app, get users and then hope you can monetise them later.\" I'd rather have 5 paying users than 200 free ones. So, that's what I've built, it's super basic but it provides value with the core feature. Let's see how it goes!  \n",

That's a pretty big shift from your first 3 which all came from personal pain points. I wonder if the monetization-first mindset accidentally pushed you away from the \"build for yourself\" instinct that generated your best ideas.\n\n\n\nNot saying it's wrong — plenty of successful products were built for other people's problems. But there's a weird middle ground where you end up optimizing for \"what could someone pay for\" instead of \"what do I desperately need\" and the product ends up kinda lukewarm. You know the problem intellectually but you don't feel it in your gut, so you make slightly off decisions about what matters.\n\n\n\nYour B2B review tool had paying customers and you walked away from it because distribution was painful. That's the one I'd go back to honestly. The product-market fit was there, you just hated the sales process. Finding a cofounder who loves cold outreach might be easier than finding product-market fit from scratch again.",

      "text": "I have a theory about why so many founders get stuck in the \"False Start.\"\n\nIt’s not because we aren't smart. It’s because we are chemically addicted to the Yellow Hat.\n\nIn the 1980s, Dr. Edward de Bono invented a framework called \"Six Thinking Hats.\" The idea is that the human brain (and now, the AI brain) struggles to do everything at once.\n\nYou can’t be creative and critical at the exact same time.\n\nSo, he separated thinking into six distinct modes:\n\n* ⚪ The White Hat: Data & Facts. \"What do the numbers say?\"\n* 🔴 The Red Hat: Emotion & Intuition. \"Does this feel exciting?\"\n* 🟡 The Yellow Hat: Optimism. \"Why will this work?\"\n* 🟢 The Green Hat: Creativity. \"What are the alternatives?\"\n* ⚫ The Black Hat: Judgment & Caution. \"Why will this fail?\"\n* 🔵 The Blue Hat: Control. \"Are we following the process?\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0l99fnz8ghhg1.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=2697ea5d56fff7c0f706da5f68883278a16a6b03\n\n**Here's the problem**:\n\nWhen you come up with a startup idea, you are usually wearing the Red Hat (Excitement).\n\nWhen you pitch an idea to ChatGPT (or a supportive friend), they instantly put on the Yellow Hat (Support) and the Green Hat (Ideation). They tell you it’s a \"great initiative.\" They list the benefits and 10 more features you could build. They feed your excitement.\n\nYou feel good. So you start building.\n\nBut nobody put on the Black Hat.\n\nNobody asked: \"What happens if the API costs triple?\" or \"Why would a user switch from Excel to this?\"\n\nYou build a product based on Yellow Hat energy, only to get crushed by Black Hat reality three months later.\n\n**Why ChatGPT can't help you here:**\n\nChatGPT is trained to be helpful and agreeable. It's optimized for user satisfaction. When you're excited about an idea, it mirrors that excitement because that's what makes you happy.\n\nIt's not being malicious. It's doing exactly what it was trained to do: support you.\n\nBut support isn't what you need on Day 1. You need someone to attack your idea. You need the Black Hat.\n\n**What I do now:**\n\nBefore I build anything, I force myself to spend 10 minutes in pure Black Hat mode.\n\nI pretend I'm a hater trying to destroy my idea. I ask:\n\n* What's the fatal flaw I'm ignoring?\n* What assumption will break me?\n* Why would this fail even if I execute perfectly?\n\nIt's uncomfortable. My brain fights it. But 2 out of 3 ideas collapse under Black Hat pressure.\n\nAnd that's good. Better to kill a fragile idea in 10 minutes than after 4 months of building.\n\n**Try this today:**\n\nLook at the project you're working on right now. You've probably spent weeks in Yellow Hat mode (thinking about launch, revenue, growth).\n\nPut on the Black Hat for 10 minutes. Be ruthless. If you were a skeptical investor or a competitor, where would you strike?\n\nIf your idea survives 10 minutes of the Black Hat, you might actually have something.",

Do you notice it drifting back to validation after 10-15 exchanges, or does it stay sharp?\n\nI've found that prompts like this work brilliantly for the first part of a conversation, but the RLHF conditioning is so deep that it eventually softens.

Tear this apart.\" Works surprisingly well. The key is making the persona specific — vague instructions like \"be critical\" get softened by its training, but a defined character with motivation holds up better.\n\nThat said, your 10-minute solo Black Hat exercise is probably still more valuable. There's something about your own brain generating the objections that makes them stick. When ChatGPT does it, it feels like reading criticism. When you do it yourself, you actually feel the uncomfortable \"oh shit\" moment where an assumption crumbles.\n\nThe Yellow Hat addiction thing is real though. I've definitely shipped things that felt great during the building phase and only realized later I was high on my own supply the whole time.",

(I took as invisible launches <10 upvotes)\n\nThe main reason I found was because of the tagline/headline/short description call it whatever. Let’s break down what winners do, because yes, there is a pattern identified not just ‘sounds cool’.\n\n1. What never worked in my sample:\n\n* “The #1 platform for modern teams.”\n* “Reinventing how you work.”\n* “Supercharge your business with AI.”\n\n1. Cut the crap\n\nYou maybe get half a second to get that attention so let’s remove the crap :\n\n* The sweet spot is 7–9 words & around 40–55 characters.\n* One clear sentence, no buzzwords, no “revolutionizing X with AI”.\n* No random emojis, no ALL CAPS, no “best-in-class” type claims.\n\n1. Be clear\n\nIf your tagline doesn’t answer “what does this do, and for who?” in that half second, they scroll past.\n\nThe best-performing taglines all did one of these two things:\n\n* Outcome-first: “Turn abandoned carts into revenue for Shopify stores.” (more demos booked, fewer bugs, faster support.)\n* Audience-first: “Analytics that non-technical founders actually understand.” (SaaS founders, agencies, solopreneurs, Shopify stores, recruiters.)\n\n1. Link with an action verb\n\nTo make a proper tagline, you need a clear verb: turn, track, collect, launch, ship.\n\nIt will connect the feature to the audience, or to the outcome or the audience to the outcome, your choice.\n\nI reverse‑engineered patterns from standout vs invisible launches and [turned it into a small playbook.](https://startuphunt.io/before-you-launch)\n\nIt breaks down:\n\n* How they picked categories that actually sent traffic\n* How they timed launches across directories\n* How they wrote one‑line pitches people clicked\n* What failed launches looked like on the same sites\n\nA fun exercise to prove how good it is : Give me your current tagline (and website) and I’ll recraft your tagline",

How many are paying? Is this thing growing?\n\nIndie Panel fixes that. You connect your PostgreSQL databases (works with Neon, Supabase, or any standard Postgres) and immediately get a clean dashboard with:\n\n\\- Total users and paid user counts\n\n\\- Growth trends and daily snapshots\n\n\\- Charts that track your metrics over time\n\n\\- AES-256 encrypted database connections\n\nIt's one dashboard for all your projects, so you can stop context-switching between databases and focus on building.\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback! What metrics do you wish you had better visibility into across your projects? \n\n  \nP.S. I'm launching on ProductHunt, where you'll find a 30% off coupon!\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/indie-panel?launch=indie-panel](https://www.producthunt.com/products/indie-panel?launch=indie-panel)",

Especially when you're just trying to get a quick webhook → Slack flow or AI agent that summarizes emails running locally or on a VPS.\n\nI got fed up with it, so I open-sourced the full backend that powers **a2n.io** and made it ridiculously easy to self-host. Repo: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nTry this one-liner right now:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nOpen http://localhost:8080, create your admin account, and you're building flows. Embedded DB + Redis mean **zero** external dependencies for dev, testing, or small personal use. (For production, swap in your own DATABASE\\_URL and REDIS\\_URL – still simple.)\n\nWhat you actually get in that container:\n\n\\- Drag-and-drop canvas (React Flow style – feels familiar if you've used n8n)\n\n\\- 30+ built-in nodes: Webhook/Schedule triggers, Google Sheets/Slack/Notion/Telegram/Gmail/Discord/GitHub/Twilio/OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok, HTTP/GraphQL/SQL, JS/Python code, filters/loops/if-else, file handling, and more\n\n\\- Real AI agent nodes that reason, call tools, and chain LLMs – no extra setup\n\n\\- Live execution monitoring + logs so you see runs happen in real time\n\n\\- MIT license – completely yours, **no white-label forced branding**, no phoning home, unlimited workflows/executions\n\nIt's MIT, so fork it, strip it, brand it, whatever. Your data never leaves your server.\n\nTrade-offs (being straight up):\n\n\\- Node library is smaller than n8n's massive ecosystem (growing, but focused on practical 80/20 stuff)\n\n\\- No ultra-advanced custom scripting depth yet (though JS/Python nodes exist)\n\n\\- Embedded mode is great for quick spins but use external DB/Redis + reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy/Traefik) for anything exposed or high-traffic\n\n\\- Project is new – repo just went public, so community is tiny and battle-testing is early\n\nI've got mine humming on a cheap VPS for daily drivers (Sheet syncs, notification bots, AI summaries) – deploys fast, runs stable, feels light compared to heavier stacks.\n\nIf the usual self-host setup tax has kept you from running more automations privately, pull the image and mess around for 5 minutes. Worst case, you delete the container.\n\nWhat usually stops you from self-hosting workflow tools like this? The multi-service compose files, worrying about updates breaking things, missing niche nodes, or just \"hosted is easier for now\"? Real talk appreciated – this is meant to scratch that exact itch.",

Repo here: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nOne-liner to spin it up:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nHit http://localhost:8080 and you're in. Built-in embedded DB + Redis so no external services needed for quick tests. For real use, just pass your own Postgres/Redis URLs and secrets.\n\nWhat you get out of the box:\n\n\\- Same visual builder: nodes, connections, real-time execution/logs\n\n\\- 30+ integrations: Google Sheets/Slack/Notion/Telegram/Gmail/GitHub/Discord/OpenAI/Twilio/etc.\n\n\\- Built-in AI agent nodes (supports OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Grok – tool use and all)\n\n\\- No white-label restrictions or forced branding – it's MIT licensed, your instance, your rules\n\n\\- Unlimited executions/workflows when self-hosted (no artificial caps)\n\nIt's not a 1:1 n8n clone—node library is smaller (growing), no ultra-deep custom code nodes yet, but for the 80% of practical flows that actually ship? This cuts the deployment pain to almost zero.\n\nI've been running it locally and on a cheap VPS—feels snappy, data stays private, and no more \"update broke my instance\" surprises.\n\nIf you're tired of heavy orchestration for simple things, give the Docker image a spin and tell me what breaks first (or what you'd want added). What's stopping you from self-hosting more automations right now—setup complexity, missing nodes, or just not worth the hassle? Genuinely want to hear.",

One time the backups didn't even exist. Recently tested a Postgres backup from Supabase — it was there but incomplete. Missing tables, truncated data.\n\nLooked for solutions: Veeam and Commvault do backup validation, but only inside their own ecosystem at enterprise pricing. Nothing vendor-agnostic for SMBs.\n\nSo I'm building it. The concept:\n→ Deploy a runner on your infra\n→ It restores your backup in an isolated container\n→ Runs verification (SQL queries, file checks, archive integrity)\n→ Signs the report cryptographically\n→ Destroys everything — zero data leaves your network\n\nDashboard for CTOs and auditors (ISO 27001 / SOC 2).\n\nSolo founder, Go + Vue.js, MVP nearly done. Landing page is live to gauge interest.\n\nhttps://restoreproof.io \n\nAnyone dealt with this problem? Would love to hear your take.",

Moshi lets you check on Claude Code, nudge Codex, or monitor any terminal session from your phone.\n\n  \nThe thing that makes it different from other SSH apps is the Mosh protocol, so your session survives WiFi drops, sleep mode, and network switches. Also added voice-to-terminal (runs on-device, no cloud), Face ID for SSH keys, and push notifications when long jobs finish.\n\n  \nBuilt the whole thing with Claude Code over about 6 weeks.

Build something useful, get users, make money. Turns out the internet being \"huge\" doesn't mean people automatically find you.\n\nBut I'm still using KironX every day.\n\nNot on LinkedIn's Jobs section. On my actual feed.\n\nI filter posts from my network:\n\n* founders mentioning problems\n* recruiters posting roles before they go public\n* CTOs talking about their roadmap\n* companies I'm connected to announcing growth\n\nI'm looking for off-market opportunities, the kind you can't find scrolling job boards.\n\nYesterday someone asked if I'd tried raising funds or reaching out to VCs. Honestly, that feels like a longer, more uncertain road right now and my anxiety is already high enough.\n\nSo I'm at a crossroads:\n\n1. Stop everything. Close the experiment, focus on getting hired.\n2. Keep going. Use my own product to find opportunities and see what happens even if it's risky.\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nI'll post Day 28 tomorrow and share whether this actually led anywhere.",

Before that, I had been doing some indie hacking on and off, but I never planned to quit my job for it.\n\nGetting laid off changed things. Even if I found a new job, the anxiety of “I could be let go again anytime” really stuck with me. That’s when I started taking indie hacking more seriously, while still consistently applying for jobs in parallel.\n\nTo be honest about the results so far: there haven’t been many. I haven’t been able to land a job for months (and the developer job market is extremely tough globally right now). On top of that, I’m in a situation where I don’t have enough savings to cover living expenses much longer, so if I don’t get a job soon, things get very difficult.\n\nBecause of that, I’ve decided to pause indie hacking for now and focus fully on job hunting. It’s been about two weeks already.\n\nI’ve completely stopped building, although I’m still doing some promotion and sharing what I’ve built. but there’s no clear signal of when (or if) that will lead anywhere. There’s also no guarantee that users would actually pay for the product I made.\n\nPersonally, unless I’m in a stable financial situation, I wouldn’t walk away from a job.",

For everyday automations (Sheet syncs, Slack bots, AI agents that actually use tools), the overhead kills the joy.\n\nSo I made the full engine behind **a2n.io** open and dead-simple to deploy yourself.  \n\nMIT licensed. No white-label forced on you. No phoning home. Your server, your rules.\n\n**One single step to get it running:**\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nThat's it.  \n\nOpen http://localhost:8080 (or your server's IP:8080), create your admin account, and start building flows immediately.\n\nEverything is embedded by default — Postgres, Redis, the works — so zero extra services or config for testing, dev, or small personal/prod use. (Want scale? Just add your own DATABASE\\_URL and REDIS\\_URL env vars later. Still easy.)\n\nWhat you get right away:\n\n\\- Familiar drag-and-drop canvas (nodes, connections, like n8n but lighter)\n\n\\- 30+ practical nodes: Webhook/Schedule triggers, Google Sheets/Slack/Notion/Telegram/Gmail/Discord/GitHub/Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok + built-in AI agents with real tool calling\n\n\\- JS/Python code nodes, HTTP/SQL, filters, loops, file handling\n\n\\- Real-time execution logs and monitoring — see exactly what's happening\n\n\\- Unlimited workflows/executions when self-hosted (no caps)\n\n\\- Data stays 100% on your machine/VPS — perfect for sensitive stuff\n\nIt's not trying to match n8n's 1000+ node ecosystem yet (growing, focused on 80/20 hits), and heavy custom scripting is lighter here. But for the flows most people actually build and run daily? This deploys fast, stays stable, and doesn't make you dread updates.\n\nI've got mine running on a cheap VPS for notification bots and AI summaries — one pull and it's up, no drama.\n\nIf you've been waiting for a self-hosted workflow tool that doesn't punish you for wanting privacy and simplicity, try that one command. Takes 30 seconds.\n\nWhat usually kills self-hosting for you — the multi-container setup, worrying about dependencies, or missing key integrations? Drop it below — this is built to fix exactly those pains. 🚀",

Spent two days setting up OpenClaw and hit every wall you mentioned — compose files, Postgres, Redis, env vars that worked locally but exploded on deploy.\n\nThe \"one command\" promise is always a lie when you actually need it for real work.\n\nI'm curious how you're handling the OAuth flows? That's been my biggest pain point — getting users through the Google/Slack auth dance without them dropping off halfway through.\n\nAlso are you pre-configuring integrations or leaving it bare? Can't decide if I want to offer \"batteries included\" templates or let people build from scratch.",
