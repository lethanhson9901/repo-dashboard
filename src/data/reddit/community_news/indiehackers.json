      "text": "I'm building Mimir which is kinda like a second brain for product managers that learns as you feed it more context.\n\n**The problem I'm solving:** PMs have 15+ unanalyzed user interviews, scattered feedback across Slack/Intercom/reviews, meetings, random ideas, notes, etc. and write briefs, emails, whatever after synthesizing all of this, constantly. Keeping it in their head as they go.\n\n**What makes it different:** It's not just an analysis tool. It's a workspace that gets smarter over time:\n\n* Paste customer feedback, interviews, metrics, anything\n* Get ranked recommendations with evidence links in \\~60 seconds\n* Generate briefs/prds/specs where every claim traces back to source quotes\n* The more context you add, the better it gets at understanding your product and making recommendations\n\nIt's also a chat-first interface. Works like a second brain that compounds knowledge as you use it.\n\n**Where I'm stuck:** I'm a senior PM/former founder. I built this for myself and it genuinely solves problems I have. But every channel is saturated with \"I built a PM tool\" posts. I can't break through the noise.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Is this a distribution problem (right product, wrong audience) or positioning problem (they see it but don't understand why they need it)?\n2. How do you get initial users when every community ignores tool announcements?\n3. Should I stop posting publicly and focus on direct outreach to PMs who write about workflows?\n\nLink: [mimir.build](http://mimir.build)\n\nLooking for honest takes. What am I missing?\n\nI picked the self promo flair, but I do geneuinely want to know w hat folks think.",

Do direct outreach to PMs who are visibly drowning (interview backlog, prioritization fights, PRDs taking forever) and offer a done-for-you before/after: they send 1–3 transcripts or a messy doc, you return an evidence-backed brief they can share. Also fix anything that blocks activation (someone said your signup email hits spam), because that can create “zero users” even when interest exists.",

Once they're using it for speed, they'll discover the compounding effect organically.\n\nYour direct outreach instinct is right, but target PMs who are publicly struggling with synthesis work, not PMs who write about workflows.

From what you're describing, the unique thing isn't the analysis, it's the workspace that compounds knowledge over time.\n\nBut your landing page and these posts lead with features instead of that core insight. Here's what I'd do: stop posting in broad communities where tool announcements get ignored. Instead, find 5-10 PMs who actively write about their workflow on Twitter or in niche PM communities.\n\nSend them direct, personalized messages explaining you built this for yourself as a senior PM and want feedback from people who think publicly about their process. Offer them free lifetime access in exchange for a 20 min call where they try it live with you. Those conversations will either validate your positioning or show you what's actually missing.\n\nAlso, Reddit matters more than you probably realize right now for discoverability. When someone searches Google for best PM tools for customer feedback or how to organize user interviews, Reddit threads rank top 3. The problem is you can't just post about your tool without getting downvoted.\n\nSome B2B companies handle this by using a done-for-you service like Community Mentions (https:// communitymentions .com) that gets them mentioned in the right threads without the spam risk. They do the research and posting so you show up where people are actively asking for solutions. Worth considering if you don't have bandwidth to monitor Reddit yourself while you're doing direct outreach.\n\nYour conversion isssue is likely that people see it as another AI wrapper when the real value is the compounding context engine.

The interesting thing you buried is \"every claim traces back to source quotes\" — that's actually solving a real pain point that PMs get called out on in reviews. Lead with that.\n\nFor initial users, stop announcing and start being useful. Find PMs complaining about specific problems on Twitter/Reddit and just... help them. Mention Mimir only if it's genuinely relevant. Cold DMs to people who write about PM workflows also convert way better than public posts.\n\nThe \"ignores tool announcements\" problem is universal — nobody cares about your tool, they care about their problem.

You can write a few SEO optimized articles along the lines of \"your first week as a PM, product 101, what to know about your first user interview\". Maybe even set up a newsletter similar to Lenny, just nicher targeting and all about helping first timers. \n\nAll these things take time to generate users but it's easier when you're targeting a small group and providing them with value.",

Another can post the same volume and hit 1K MRR in 30 days because their ICP already lives there and feels the pain. In 20 early stage launches I reviewed, the ones that crossed 1K MRR fastest had three things. Clear ICP narrow enough to describe in one sentence. A painful use case with weekly frequency. And a channel where that ICP was already gathering. Also the 48 hour ship rule works only if the problem is urgent. Some B2B products need 30 to 60 day sales cycles. Killing them in 7 days creates false negatives. The real common thread is speed of feedback loops. Short loops win. Long silent loops kill.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "I see a lot of posts on here talking about how improtant it is to validate your idea and I think many founders read those posts and agree even though they haven’t properly validated their idea themselves.\n\nThe chances that you’re building something nobody wants are high especially if you’re a new founder.\n\nYou’re gonna be biased towards your idea because we all are and it’s very difficult not to be.\n\nI’ve built apps both with no demand and strong demand so I thought I would share what the difference in those experiences looked like for me.\n\nHopefully you can read this and it will help you figure out if you might be in the “risk zone” of building something nobody wants.\n\n**1. How difficult is marketing for you?**\n\nMarketing is obviously difficult and it’s the same for everyone but marketing an app that nobody wants is near impossible.\n\nI put about the same amount of effort into marketing my first app (no demand) and my current app (strong demand).\n\nAfter 5 months of marketing my first app (which was an AI form for sales people), I didn't have a single active user. I could get people to check out my landing page but VERY few signed up and practically no one used it.\n\nWhen I did marketing for my current app (product development platform) it took 2 weeks to get my first 100 users. I guess I'm a bit of an extreme example since the difference in demand was so big but still you get what I’m trying to say.\n\nIf all your marketing efforts don’t lead to any results you have likely built something nobody wants.\n\nAnd I know it’s difficult here to judge if it's just that your marketing is bad and you’re not doing enough or if your product lacks demand. A way to tell the difference is if you can get traffic to your site or not.\n\nIf you can't get traffic to your site = bad marketing\n\nIf you can and the traffic converts to users = good sign\n\nIf you can and it doesn’t convert = bad sign\n\n**2. How do people react to your product?**\n\nPeople rarely complimented my AI form or said anything close to “this is useful to me”.\n\nSince day one people have been saying how good my current idea is and how much potential they see in the product.\n\nNo one ever gave me feedback on my AI form but I get feedback all the time now. People want to get involved and help and it's been like that since I launched my MVP.\n\nI don't want this to sound like some form of bragging. I'm just trying to convey that if people aren’t hyped and excited about your product then it’s a bad sign.\n\nYou can definitely tell when people are genuinely impressed by your product and when it's more \"meh\", so this signal is pretty easy to pick up on.\n\n**3. What did the groundwork look like for you?**\n\nHow did everything start with your product? Did you try to solve a problem you experienced yourself or that you knew others experienced? Did you talk to people before building?\n\nMy first product was quite spontaneous and didn’t really solve a big problem. I wanted to build something to get better at coding and I fell in love with my product as I started building.\n\nMy goal became to make it better and better because I was proud of it, it was cool, and it looked good.\n\nMy product now came directly from a problem that was painful to me and before I started building it I spent time on the groundwork. I reached out to my target audience to understand the problem better, understand them better, and get input on my idea.\n\nIf you didn’t begin by talking to people to validate the problem and your solution then you’re definitely in the “risk zone”.\n\nIt is possible that you came up with a “million-dollar idea” just through intuition but it’s not likely.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nAccept the fact that every founder is very biased towards their own idea and will bend reality to make it fit their narrative. Also accept that you’re more likely than not one of them.\n\nEscape this bias by relying on data for your decisions, because data doesn’t lie. The data comes from doing proper market research and talking to your target audience before building.\n\nI hope this post can help some of you fall out of love with your unvalidated product.\n\np.s.

When demand is weak, even tiny friction kills adoption. In one dataset I tracked, products with strong pull still converted 12 to 18% of warm traffic despite messy onboarding. Weak pull products converted under 3% even with polished UX. Another overlooked sign is how fast feedback loops form. If you launch and within 30 days you are not overwhelmed with edge cases, requests and weird usage patterns, that is usually not a good sign. Real demand creates operational chaos early. That is where having systems matters. I use Runable to break user flows into granular steps and map failure points because once traction hits, manual patching collapses fast. Demand shows up in behavior, not compliments.\n\n",

No urgency, no budget, no calendar access = walk away.\n\nAlso worth tracking two numbers: % of cold traffic that signs up, and % of signups that come back unprompted within a week. Those tell you a lot faster than vanity metrics.\n\nTools like Sparktoro, Beehiiv sponsor swaps, and Pulse for Reddit make it way easier to actually find and talk to those early users instead of building in a vacuum.\n\nMain point: if you can’t get money, time, or recurring usage, the market already gave you your answer.",

Here’s how it works:\n\n - For every idea you add, we scan multiple real time data sources like Google ad keywords, serp and Reddit. We pull out what people are excited about, what they’re struggling with, and what they actually ask for. Then we turn it into a structured report (with links to the real posts) so you can see if it’s worth building.\n\n - Once you set it up, we keep watching Reddit for you. If someone new shows interest in your space (asks a question, complains about a tool, etc.), you get a notification. Basically, early customer discovery on autopilot.\n\n - we've also got a library of over 1.5k startup ideas mined from about 100 subs in total which you can explore",

So here it is.\n\nThis is the design. Not a mockup of a wishlist, these are the actual screens I'm shipping for the AWS Competition prototype.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3t57kx5pu8lg1.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=3abe9d76afb08a0c086c5d08de87a4a9e36fc309\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/avg69zhru8lg1.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b7366ac3ec332894f751f6f347c93f9accb6b38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2d7x7hnsu8lg1.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f7cdb8ba1479066079b7ab99321ebd99b74f7b\n\nThe core idea: you ask Cirrondly a question about your AWS costs in plain English. It connects to your account, finds exactly what's wasting money, and lets you fix it in one click.\n\nNo Cost Explorer. No charts. No DevOps degree required.\n\nThe diagnosis screen above? That's an AI agent that found $1,120/month in savings across 3 services in under a minute. Idle EC2 instances running at 2% CPU. 1.5TB of unattached EBS storage. Outdated snapshots. All real waste, all fixable.\n\nThe \"Shut down instance / Keep running\" screen is my favorite. Because that's the moment that matters: the agent found something, explained it clearly, and now you decide. No meetings, no graph that explains everything and nothing, no need for a tutorial or an expert. No digging through consoles. For me, this is the disconnect button the cloud always needed.\n\n17 days left. The product isn't live yet but the waitlist is open: [cirrondly.com](http://cirrondly.com).\n\nIf you're burning money on AWS and want early access, drop a comment or DM me. I'm giving the first 10 people free access when I ship\n\n",

That’s the kind of thing I’ve seen actually get shared in Slack channels.\n\n\n\nFor finding more of these spike stories, I’ve used things like GummySearch and Ahrefs for keywords, but Pulse for Reddit has been best when I want to catch fresh threads where people are mid‑panic about their bills and see the raw language they use.\n\n\n\nYour main point stands: the market is already validated, now it’s about building a dead‑simple path from “oh shit, my bill” to “here’s exactly what to click.",

In one of my previous experiences, I saw the problem and lived it. As a technical leader, I saw how a company that produced more than €4 million had a hard time knowing its expenses. I was the CTO who had to do everything. Then, when I was CTO, I saw the founder who wanted to make an investment call and didn't know how to calculate how much he would spend on 10 clients.\nThen there's the axis of personal experience: how painful it is to spend a lot of money because you left something connected and forgot about it, or simply don't know how to set up cost alerts.\nThen there's the question of asking. I created an account on X, posted for several months, and someone told me they had that pain when they logged into AWS Cost. I found it understandable. I was building something and wanted to spend less.\nThe last two are validation by searching how many people have complained about surprise bills.",

Don’t sell the product, sell the outcome (“I’ll find you wasted spend in 20 mins”). Record objections.

      "text": "Hello all,\n\nIn June 2025, I launched an MVP for a simple AI wrapper and organic search traffic went BANANAS..\n\nSo in Dec 23th 2025, I hired someone to turn it into a real SaaS to monetize all that crazy traffic.\n\nSince then (less than 2 months), the app achieved 1,060+ free users, 10 paid users, $1060 ARR, 32 DR, and over 1,700+ backlinks.\n\nIt’s called WTFood, a macro tracking companion that helps people actually understand what they eat, not just see calorie numbers, but unlock context behind their meals.\n\nThe brand name is extremely TikTok-friendly. “What The Food” resonates instantly with short-form content and social media. The type of name that makes people stop scrolling.\n\nWhy I’m selling:\n\nI’m no tech guy, but a marketing dude! I hired someone to build me this but scaling LLM-heavy products properly requires deeper technical expertise. There are some minor AI inconsistencies that a stronger operator could optimize quickly.\n\nAlso, building, scaling, and exiting online businesses is literally what I’ve been doing for the past 10 years. I enjoy the early-stage game.\n\nGrowth angles I didn’t fully execute:\n\n* Mobile app (huge opportunity)\n* Programmatic SEO at scale\n* TikTok/UGC content loops\n* Fitness influencer partnerships\n* B2B (coaches, nutritionists)\n\nThis would be ideal for:\n\n* A technical founder who wants an existing base\n* Someone bullish on AI + health\n* An indie hacker who prefers improving vs starting from zero\n\n**Costs**: Supabase database $25/m and Gemini API per call \\~$3.5/m\n\nI’m happy to share Stripe screenshots, analytics, and walk through everything transparently.\n\nNot desperate to sell, just looking for the right operator who can take it further.\n\nIf interested, comment or DM.",

I’d also document churn reasons + feature requests (even a scrappy Google Sheet or using something like InsightLab for cancel flows) so the next owner isn’t guessing why people bounce and can iterate faster instead of treating WTFood like a mysterious protein bar they found in the gym parking lot.",

      "text": "\"The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant.\" That's Einstein. And I think we need to start treating AI more like the faithful servant it is and less like the gift. Here's what I mean.\n\nRunning a business is just making decisions over and over. Every decision comes down to context, what do you have, what's missing, and then making the call anyway. That's it.\n\nBuilding with ai for a few years has made me see where the ceiling is. It's fast at processing information. But that's not the same as having instinct or intuition.\n\nYou hear this from people who've done deals for decades. Gut feel. Walking into a room and knowing something's off before anyone's said a word. That's pattern recognition from years of being wrong and recalibrating. AI doesn't have that layer. It can tell you what the data says. It can't tell you this deal feels wrong even though the numbers look right. That stuff lives somewhere else.\n\nHere's what I've started doing: I open fresh AI sessions constantly. Not because the old one was bad, but because I want to come at the same problem without prior context dragging me in one direction. It's like going for a walk. You step away, come back 20 minutes later, and your brain has reorganized everything. AI doesn't have an equivalent of that. It doesn't forget on purpose. So I do it manually. New session, same problem, see what comes back different.\n\nThe people I know who use AI well aren't handing it decisions. They're using it to surface information faster so they can spend more time on the part that actually matters... making the call with incomplete information. That's what business is.\nAnyone else thinking about this? Where are you drawing the line between what you hand to AI and what you keep for yourself?",

AI systems do not have this particular ability because they cannot experience real-world consequences.\n\nYour observation about creating new sessions for research purposes is important to me. I use a similar method to test different ways of presenting my ideas to others. The same prompt leads to different results when tested in different situations. The process involves using intuition to eliminate the tendency of people to base their judgments on initial information.\n\nThe division between the two fields becomes clear to me through this statement. The use of artificial intelligence serves to create new knowledge, which helps organisations assess various choices while testing their logical frameworks. Humans should decide between different options, which require them to consider both time-related factors and human relationships.\n\nThe moment a decision has an asymmetric downside, I don’t outsource it.

Only problem with research, even when telling it to cite sources to prevent hallucination, it presents a source link which looks amazingly real (nasa .gov/articlerelevanttome), but the page doesn't exist and never have, it's basically like it's going \"oh if this article existed it would be exactly what she's looking for\" lol.\n\nWe'll probably start seeing some really custom models trained on a massive context for a very specific situation but true human intuition is too complex to translate into an algorithm in my opinion.",

          "text": "This is not a bad idea, actually. Especially for a marketplace like this, where supply and demand tend to form a long-term, \"monogamous\" relationship, which has a high risk of disintermediation, which is the biggest threat to commission-based models in this space: once the pet owner trusts a sitter, they just text them directly and the platform loses both of them. A subscription model sidesteps that entirely because you're not taxing each transaction.\n\nI don't know if they still do it, but UrbanSitter, a marketplace for babysitters, used to charge a subscription from both the providers and the customers. Worth looking into how they structured it. I co-wrote a pretty good article on all the different ways to marketplace monetize: [https://www.sharetribe.com/academy/how-top-100-marketplaces-monetize/](https://www.sharetribe.com/academy/how-top-100-marketplaces-monetize/)\n\nThe catch is that this only works if you can deliver enough demand. If sitters are paying $15-29/mo but not getting bookings through your platform, they'll churn fast. And that's probably your biggest hurdle right now. Marketplaces live or die on liquidity: your ability to match supply and demand reliably. Without that, you're just a booking tool nobody's booking through. So you have to deal with the #1 problem for marketplace: chicken and egg or cold start problem.\n\nTo deal with that, realize your marketplace has a strong local component. A pet sitter in Austin doesn't help a dog owner in Boston. So I'd recommend starting hyperlocal. Like, your own neighborhood or zip code. Saturate one small area with both sitters and pet owners before expanding. Practically every successful local marketplace did this, including Airbnb (started in SF during conference season) and Uber (one city at a time). It's tempting to launch broadly, but thin coverage everywhere is worse than deep coverage somewhere.\n\nu/gaiaom's feedback is also worth taking seriously. They're an actual pet sitter (right?) saying they wouldn't pay a subscription. That might mean you charge the demand side instead (pet owners pay for access to vetted sitters), or it might mean you need a generous free tier that gives sitters enough value before asking them to pay. Either way, always good to listen to the people doing the work.",

      "text": "As a solo founder, I kept hitting the same wall: I wanted quick, private automations to handle repetitive stuff (like syncing leads from Sheets to CRM, queuing daily posts to X, or AI agents summarizing feedback to Slack). \n\nThese could save me hours every week, but the setup for self-hosted tools always turned into its own massive chore.\n\nI'd get excited, spin up a container, then spend evenings fighting compose files, external DB configs, volumes that wouldn't persist properly, and updates that broke things silently. The **automation solution** ended up creating more overhead than the manual work I was trying to escape. Ideas piled up in \"someday\" tabs, and I stayed stuck doing things by hand.\n\nThe insight that hit me: most of us don't need infinite customization in the hosting layer. We need something reliable, private, and low-friction – so the focus stays on building flows, not babysitting servers.\n\nThat's why I started shaping a2n.io into a self-host friendly version: one pre-built Docker image with everything embedded (Postgres + Redis), no extras required to get going. Kept it MIT licensed, no forced white-label or branding – deploy it anywhere (local machine, VPS, your choice).\n\n**Repo with the latest docs**: https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\n**The deploy step that made it feel simple**:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\n**Docker pulls the image, starts the container, persists your data in the volume**.  \n\nOpen http://localhost:8080, set your admin password – drag-and-drop builder ready in under a minute.\n\n**Upgrades are seamless**:  \n\n```bash\n\ndocker pull sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\ndocker stop a2n && docker rm a2n\n\n# re-run the docker run command above\n\n```\n\nYour workflows, credentials, and history stay safe in the volume – no data wipe, no manual migrations for most updates. Takes 20 seconds, zero surprises.\n\nWhat I'm running now:\n\n\\- Visual drag-and-drop canvas  \n\n\\- **110+ nodes** covering everyday needs: Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok agents with tool calling, HTTP/SQL, JS/Python code, webhooks, schedules, files  \n\n\\- Real-time execution logs & monitoring  \n\n\\- Unlimited workflows and executions (no caps)  \n\n\\- One-click n8n flow migration (paste your JSON export – converts and runs with warnings for adaptations)  \n\n\\- Horizontal scaling (main + worker containers via compose, auto-discovery in cluster)  \n\n\\- Vertical scaling (CPU/mem limits, concurrent executions, pool sizes adjustable from UI System Monitor)  \n\n\\- Auto schema upgrades and migrations on pull  \n\nIt's not about matching every niche node out there – it's focused on the practical 80/20 that lets indie founders ship fast without the tinkering tax turning into its own project. Less overhead, more shipping.\n\nVery early days for the self-host side (repo got recent updates with scaling and migration features), but if you've felt that \"tool to save time creates more time sink\" loop, give that one command a quick test. Low risk, quick to spin up.\n\nAnyone else been in that cycle where the automation tool itself becomes the bottleneck? What's your biggest self-host frustration right now – setup complexity, upgrade pains, or something else? Sharing because those exact issues pushed me to keep simplifying. 🚀",

The self-hosting trap is real — I've burned entire weekends fighting Docker configs for automations that were supposed to save me 2 hours a week.\n\nOne thing worth calling out though: the lead-sync-to-CRM piece you mention is usually just the tail end of the problem. The step before it — actually sourcing the leads — is where most solo founders either overpay or give up. Plenty of people I know are paying $99/month for Apollo or Hunter and running one campaign per quarter. Doesn't add up.\n\nThe smarter play for lean teams: decouple the data problem from the automation problem. Use one-time or per-CSV tools for sourcing (they exist, just less hyped), then pipe into whatever workflow tool fits. Your setup sounds like a good fit for the automation layer. Are you building any data source connectors, or assuming users bring their own CSVs/Sheets?",

People at her work saw it during screen shares / in person and asked \"what is that?\" They installed it too, and then it spread the same way.\n\nSo the product seems to \"sell itself\" once someone sees it, but people don’t naturally search for \"new tab link dashboard\" as a category.\n\nMy question: how would you turn this visual / workplace copy loop into a repeatable acquisition channel without spamming and without a sales team?\n\nSpecifically, I'd love advice on:\n\nHow would you recreate the \"someone saw it\" moment online?\n\nHow else can I grow this?\n\nIf you were me, what would you do in the next 2 weeks to get the first 1,000 real users?\n\nIf you want to see it, here's the link to the Google Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/thrive-tab-instant-access/gpjonhpjbklemamfojblbiilommammfk (happy for any feedback, I'm just getting started here)",

If fewer than 10–20% of users trigger a share, the loop isn’t strong enough yet. Add frictionless sharing like “duplicate my setup” links for teams.

      "text": "As a solo founder I kept running into the same trap:\n\nI wanted simple, private automations (lead sync from Sheets to CRM, daily X post queues, AI summaries to Slack) to save 5–10 hours a week.\n\nBut every time I tried self-hosting, the tool itself became the bottleneck.\n\n\\- Endless compose files  \n\n\\- External Postgres/Redis configs  \n\n\\- Volume persistence issues  \n\n\\- Updates that silently broke things  \n\nThe **solution** to reduce manual work was creating more manual work. Ideas stayed in \"someday\" tabs forever.\n\nSo I started building the opposite approach for a2n.io:\n\nA low-code/no-code workflow builder that deploys and scales with minimal friction – focused on shipping fast, not infra tinkering.\n\nLatest self-host version: one pre-built Docker image with everything embedded (Postgres + Redis), MIT licensed, no forced white-label/branding. Deploy anywhere: local, VPS, your cloud.\n\n**Repo (check horizontal.yml, scaling guide, changelog)**:  \n\nhttps://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\n**One-step deploy:**\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\n\\- Docker pulls & starts  \n\n\\- Open http://localhost:8080  \n\n\\- Set admin password  \n\n\\- Drag-drop builder ready in <60 seconds\n\n**Seamless upgrades:**\n\n```bash\n\ndocker pull sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\ndocker stop a2n && docker rm a2n\n\n# re-run the docker run command\n\n```\n\n\\- Data stays safe in volume  \n\n\\- Schema upgrades/migrations auto-handled  \n\n\\- 20 seconds, zero surprises\n\nWhat I'm running today:\n\n\\- Visual drag-and-drop canvas  \n\n\\- **110+ nodes** covering real use cases:  \n\n  \\- Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio  \n\n  \\- OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok agents with tool calling  \n\n  \\- HTTP, SQL, JS/Python code nodes, webhooks, schedules, files  \n\n\\- Real-time execution logs & monitoring  \n\n\\- Unlimited workflows & executions  \n\n\\- One-click n8n flow migration (paste JSON export → converts & runs with warnings)  \n\n\\- Horizontal scaling (main + worker containers via compose, auto-discovery)  \n\n\\- Vertical scaling (CPU/mem limits, concurrent executions, pool sizes from UI System Monitor)  \n\nIt's not about having 1000+ niche nodes.  \n\nIt's about the 80/20 that lets indie founders actually ship automations without the hosting becoming a second product.\n\nLess tinkering. More building.\n\nVery early self-host path (recent repo updates added scaling & migration features).  \n\nIf you've felt the **automation tool creates more overhead than it removes** loop, give that one command a spin. Takes a minute to test.\n\nWhat's the biggest self-host friction you've hit lately – setup complexity, scaling, migrations, or upgrade surprises?  \n\nSharing because those exact pains drove every simplification here. 🚀",

That actionability threshold seems to be universal across SaaS.\n\n\n\nFor voice especially, I'd also track:\n\n\\- Repeat usage within 24 hours (does the voice interface become habitual?)\n\n\\- Average actions per session (is the friction so low they keep adding more tasks?)\n\n\\- App reconnects (how many integrations does a power user connect?)\n\n\n\nThe fact that users are triggering real actions, not just testing the novelty, means you're past the cool-factor chasing and into actual utility.

The question is if your onboarding gets out of their way fast enough for it to happen in the first session. At one point I had a 93% drop off in my product during the activation stage because users weren't finding value fast enough - as soon as they saw value within the first 60 seconds we saw repeat usage, longer sessions, and higher conversion rates.   \n  \nYour 2+ cross-app actions threshold seems critical. I'd add one cut to the data: how long does it take your best users to hit it? Analyze the actions of your highest-retained users and see how long it takes for them to reach that threshold. For churned users, does it take them longer? Why? What do they do instead? What's different about them specifically? That gap is your roadmap.\n\nCongrats and good luck! ",

Upvotes mean visibility. Visibility means traffic. So I scraped and analyzed 15,000 launches to find the pattern.\n\nA few weeks ago, I joined a hackathon. 26 participants. We voted and gave each other real feedback. No filters, no politeness tax.\n\nI finished 4th.\n\nThe feedback hit different. These were strangers who could be my actual audience. They didn't know me, so they told me the truth. And the truth was: the best ideas don't come from solo research. They come from outside perspective.\n\nThat changed everything.\n\nStartupHunt used to be my research. Me finding startup ideas worth copying, writing them up, sending them out.\n\nNow, I’m going to interview founders who hit a real revenue milestone (only founders listed on TrustMRR, so you know they're legit). And I ask them one thing: what was the one move that got you there?\n\nNot \"how do you approach distribution.\" Not generic advice. One specific play that actually worked.\n\n**Why this matters more in 2026**\n\nAI changed the game fast. You can ask any chatbot for startup growth advice and get a clean answer in 5 seconds.\n\nBut clean isn't the same as real.\n\nWhat I'm building is a co-created library of startup growth plays. Real founders. Real moves. Things that worked once and can work again with the right context.\n\nThat's something ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude can't give you. They search the surface. This is the underground.\n\nMy business turn:\n\nFounders get featured. The audience grows. More founders want in. The library gets deeper.\n\n300+ subscribers already. Shared on X, Reddit, and LinkedIn. Videos coming.\n\nIf you've hit a revenue milestone and have one specific play that moved the needle, reply to this email.\n\nWe'll get into the DMs. I'll feature you on [**startuphunt.io**](https://startuphunt.io/).\n\nthe hackathon : [kaijubeam.com](http://kaijubeam.com)\n\nI got inspired a lot by starterstory (he sold his business a few weeks ago)",

      "text": "I've been on this journey with **self-hosting** for a while now, trying to get private automations running for my side projects without the SaaS fee buildup or data worries. Things like pulling leads from Sheets to my CRM, auto-queuing daily posts to X, or AI agents summarizing customer feedback and pinging Slack – all ideas that could save me hours weekly, but they always stalled at the infra stage.\n\nEvery attempt started with excitement, then devolved into battling compose files, external Postgres and Redis configs, volume glitches, and updates that broke everything. I'd end up spending way too much time just getting the thing to boot, only to abandon it when scaling or migrations became a hassle. \n\nThe **tool to automate my life** was turning into its own endless side project, and my motivation would tank.\n\nThe turning point was realizing I needed something simpler – not a full enterprise beast, but something focused on the **80/20** that actually ships for solo founders. So I reworked the engine behind a2n.io into a Docker-friendly version, embedding Postgres 16 and Redis so no external services are needed upfront. Added practical stuff like one-click n8n flow migration (paste your JSON export, it converts and runs with warnings for any adaptations), horizontal scaling (main instance + worker containers via compose, auto-discovery in cluster), vertical scaling (adjust CPU/mem limits, concurrent executions, pool sizes directly from the UI System Monitor), automatic schema upgrades and migrations on pull (DB tools handle changes seamlessly), and a free lifetime license key (head to the updated GitHub page or a2n.io/signup → Settings → Docker License to generate it) to unlock those features like custom nodes, DB backup/restore/migrate, and advanced monitoring.\n\n**Repo with all the updated details (check the horizontal.yml template, license activation guide, changelog for scaling/migration deets):** https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\nThe deploy step that finally let me move past the frustration:\n\n```bash\n\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\n```\n\nDocker pulls the image, starts it up, persists everything in the volume. Hit http://localhost:8080, set your admin password – drag-drop builder ready in seconds. No compose yaml required at the start.\n\n**Upgrades are seamless now**:  \n\n```bash\n\ndocker pull sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n\ndocker stop a2n && docker rm a2n\n\n# re-run the docker run command above\n\n```\n\nYour flows, credentials, and history stay safe in the volume. Schema upgrades and migrations happen automatically (free license unlocks the full DB tools if needed). I've done this a bunch – 20 seconds, no surprises or data loss.\n\nWhat it's been like since:\n\n\\- Familiar visual canvas  \n\n\\- **110+ nodes** for real workflows: Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok agents with tool calling, HTTP/SQL, JS/Python code, webhooks, schedules, files, and more  \n\n\\- Real-time logs & monitoring – failures show immediately  \n\n\\- No white-label requirements – deploy anywhere (local, VPS), it's fully yours  \n\n\\- Unlimited workflows/executions (hosted free tier caps at 100/mo, self-run none)  \n\n\\- One-click n8n import – no rebuild hassle  \n\n\\- Horizontal & vertical scaling from UI  \n\n\\- Auto schema upgrades/migrations  \n\nIt's not chasing thousands of niche nodes – honed for the high-ROI stuff that saves time without the overhead. For bigger loads, external DB/Redis + proxy is easy to layer on.\n\nThe real unlock? I actually finish and run automations now, instead of letting setup kill the vibe. Less stalled ideas, more focus on building.\n\nIf you've been in a similar self-host loop, that one command is worth testing. Super low-risk.\n\nWhat's been your biggest self-host roadblock lately – compose complexity, scaling pains, migration rework, upgrade fears, or something else? Sharing because those exact frustrations pushed me to keep simplifying this. The free license on the GitHub page unlocks a ton if you check it out. 🚀",

The moment you add workers + queues + retries + migrations you’re basically maintaining infra, not shipping workflows. I’ve seen solo founders lose 6 to 8 hours just debugging volumes after a minor Docker update. That wipes out the whole save 5 hours a week promise real quick. The embedded Postgres + Redis angle is actually strong because most breakages happen at the external dependency layer, not the workflow layer. Guardrails matter though. Once people chain 8 to 12 AI nodes, token burn can spike fast. If one node averages 1k tokens per run and you’re running 500 executions a day, that’s 500k tokens daily before retries. Add looping or parallel branches and costs double without anyone noticing. I’d surface per workflow token usage, cost per execution, and failure rate in a dead simple dashboard. Same for concurrency controls, race conditions usually show up when two branches write to the same resource without locking. If you can make scaling predictable, like clear worker to throughput ratios and execution per minute benchmarks on X CPU and Y RAM, that’s way more compelling than just saying horizontal scaling supported.

      "text": "I was in that classic indie trap for a while: I had all these automations I wanted to run privately – pulling leads from Sheets to my CRM, auto-posting daily content to X from a queue, AI agents summarizing customer replies and dropping them in Slack. Self-hosting was the goal – no SaaS creep, full data control, unlimited everything.\n\nBut every time I tried, it fell apart fast. Compose files exploding, external Postgres and Redis refusing to connect, volumes getting messed up on restart, then an update wiping my progress. I'd spend hours (sometimes days) just getting the UI to load, only to abandon it when something broke. The **I'll fix it tomorrow** pile grew, and so did the manual work I hated.\n\nThe irony? I was building tools to save time, but the infra overhead was eating more than any subscription. I realized the setup was the real blocker – not the ideas.\n\nSo I started stripping down the engine I use for **a2n.io** (my hosted playground) to remove every pain point. Embedded Postgres and Redis so no external services needed at first. Pre-built the image. Added one-click n8n flow migration (paste your JSON export – it converts, adapts unsupported nodes with warnings, and runs). Then layered in horizontal scaling (main + worker containers via compose, auto-discovery in cluster), vertical scaling (tune CPU/mem limits, concurrent executions, pool sizes right from the UI System Monitor), automatic schema upgrades/migrations on pull (DB tools handle schema changes), and a free lifetime license key (generate at a2n.io/signup → Settings → Docker License) to unlock those self-hosted tools like custom nodes, DB backup/restore/migration, and monitoring.\n\nRepo with all the updated docs (check the horizontal.yml template, license activation guide, changelog): https://github.com/johnkenn101/a2nio\n\n**The deploy that finally broke the cycle for me**:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d --name a2n -p 8080:8080 -v a2n-data:/data sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\n```\n\nDocker pulls it, starts up, persists everything in the volume. Hit http://localhost:8080, set your admin – drag-drop canvas ready in under a minute. No compose yaml upfront, no separate containers.\n\n**Upgrades are now seamless**:  \n```bash\ndocker pull sudoku1016705/a2n:latest\ndocker stop a2n && docker rm a2n\n# re-run the docker run command\n```\nData stays safe in the volume. Schema upgrades happen automatically (license unlocks DB tools for any manual tweaks), no wipe-outs. I've done it multiple times – 20 seconds, no surprises.\n\n**What it's been like since**:\n\n- Visual builder with the feel I like  \n- **110+ nodes** for real workflows: Sheets, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Gmail, Discord, GitHub, Twilio, OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok agents with tool calling, HTTP/SQL, JS/Python code, webhooks, schedules, files, and more  \n- Real-time logs & monitoring – failures show up immediately  \n- No white-label forced – deploy local, VPS, anywhere, it's yours  \n- Unlimited workflows/executions (hosted free tier caps at 100/mo, self-run none)  \n- One-click n8n import – huge for switching without rebuild  \n- Horizontal scaling: 1 main + N workers, shared DB/Redis  \n- Vertical scaling: UI sliders for resources/concurrent limits  \n- Auto schema upgrades/migrations – license unlocks full DB tools  \n\nIt's not trying to out-node-count enterprise tools yet – focused on the 80/20 that saves time for solo founders. For bigger loads, external DB/Redis + proxy is straightforward.\n\nThe change has been night and day: I finish automations instead of abandoning them. More shipped value, less infra guilt.\n\nIf setup hell or migration rework has kept your workflows stuck in \"someday,\" that one command is worth a spin. Low stakes to test.\n\nWhat's your current self-host blocker – compose complexity, scaling pains, migration hassle, upgrade fears, or something else? Your stories are why I kept cutting the fat on this. Check the repo for the free license unlock – it's helped a lot. 🚀",

Curious if you’ve thought about bundling opinionated starter flows too (onboarding, churn checks with something like InsightLab, basic CRM sync), so people can basically go from zero to “oh wow this is actually live” in an afternoon instead of another weekend infra project.",
