You don’t want to unexpectedly hit cost limits, request-per-second caps, or provider quotas. It also helps protect against bad actors using your app as a proxy. Adding alerts when usage approaches a limit would be a nice touch and relatively easy to implement.\n\nContent safety (possibly overkill, but relevant):\n\nSince the app seems mainly focused on kids, you might consider sending the generated result to another LLM (image-to-text) for moderation checks (sexual content, inappropriate text, etc.). Even if you already restrict this in your prompt, a creative user can bypass it. You can’t prevent everything, but you can make a best effort.\n\nAdditional input methods & accessibility:\n\nI added speech support to the UI using the Web Speech API. This allows not only image-based input but also speech-to-image flows. In this case, you’d also need to secure against prompt injection.\n\nPossible flows could be:\n\nspeech → doodle → AI image\n\nspeech → AI image\n\nspeech → style → applied to a doodle\n\nNot all kids are great painters, and having worked with children with disabilities, I think offering multiple input options is important.\n\nGood luck!!",

It also has a book which explains the basic stuff. I am the same as you experienced dev but no hardware exp so the book was quite helpful\n\nEdit: Be wary though, it is so fun that I got a box full of electronics at home now that is full of components used in past prototyping/having fun projects :p like led strips, microphones, various sensors, cables, solder, breadboards, a few arduinos, a few pi picos, etc. lol",

It's still just reimplementing things that already exist but in, probably, a worse way. \n\nI think a really cool follow up post for you would be to have AI analyze existing popular operating systems and try to identify limitations or pain points. Then try to have it address those in your OS implementation. Basically work together with it to try and come up with a truly novel OS, architecture, or paradigm in how OSs work or should be used.

BOOM)\n\nSo far my experience was great, it was quite expensive in time, but in API it wasnt because i was using Google AI Studio and just uploading my entire codebase.txt with the files labeled to the AI, now im looking forward to develop myself with real skills instead of AI and try to get a real job haha, good luck for everyone trying to make these things.\n\nEDIT: I was looking at my old code and i forgot i added a working own file system idk why i called it \"pfs32\" but yeah it works, it has delete, create and etc, might upload to github.",

I have extensive programming experience so I'm good at reading code and understanding how it works and how different pieces come together. I have that shit down pat.\n\nI have been giving ChatGPT and Claude firm instructions on what requirements I have and asking it to work within those requirements. The code almost never works on the first try if it's a complex request but refining the prompts fixes it, but the real danger is when the code seems to work but has logic flaws or security vulnerabilities. \n\nReviewing the code, it often becomes clear the LLMs don't have a full understanding of how the different pieces work together. For example, I recently had an issue that BOTH Claude and GPT couldn't fix until I found what the issue was and told them how to fix it.\n\nThere was a call from a render loop which would get the loading percentage from the background process which was doing the loading. There was another variable for load completion being set to true by the background thread, on the background thread, which would stop the background thread from continuing to run after it hit 100%. The problem was that this was happening before the render loop could read that it was at 100% so the loading never got flagged as complete on the render thread. In situations like this one both Claude and GPT completely failed to debug the problem because they couldn't understand the context. I had to specifically tell them what the problem was and how to fix it.\n\nI really think the issue with AI code is how people will use it without knowing how to read code so they won't know if the output is any good or not.\n\nAt the end of the day, to an experienced programmer, AI ends up just being an overhyped form of auto complete. It speeds things up but relying on it for debugging or generating complex projects for now is still a fools errand.\n\nThose are just my thoughts I'm open to changing my view but I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\n\n ",

The trick is to get a fairly detailed idea put together, then give that outline as a .md to Claude opus 4.5 in plan mode or gpt5.2-high, and then ask it to create a detailed PRD from the outline and break up the workflow into tasks that will be executed by ai agents. Include tests for every step. \n\nYou will end up with a bunch of quick and concise tasks that you can copy and paste into the prompt for cheaper agents to execute.  I like GLM-4.7 for that lately.

I was trying to learn python but ideas kept coming to me and I had no idea to implement them so I turned to vibe coding and I'm working on my own Augment clone. You could use Augments mcp in your various platforms too. Not here to advertise it. Augment is going down because they have messed up their pricing and made it similar to Cursor's, I feel sometimes that it is just taking the scenic route to use more credits. It is quite expensive because I use legacy pro which is 208000 credits but I've used 121000 in two days granted I did do some major work using Opus.

After that, I started writing software for my printing business, including prepress and variable-data handling, and it works.  Now I'm thinking of selling it, but I need to make it look like a modern product with a nice design. That's why I'm looking for a web designer who will be responsible for delivering my code to the auditorium, not stealing it, since that code is based on my knowledge and skills.",

          "text": "I was a C or D student in comp sci back around 2005. I was addicted to videogames and wasn't serious about classes. Eventually had a wake-up call that I was never going to be able to fix my fucked up GPA at this point so I might as well just pivot to business and focus (and did well from that point on).\n\nWith my only formal education being 2 years of comp sci (that I barely understood even back then), I had to play the game \"The Farmer Was Replaced\" to even learn the basics again. However, these vibe coding tools still enabled me to get what I want out of them.\n\nFor example, I don't know coding best practices, but I can ask the tool to review for those best practices and apply them. I don't know security best practices, but I can ask it to review for security. I don't know what I don't know so I can't even ask them to address it...so I ask it to red-team the proposed design and tell me what I don't know that I should be considering. I don't know how to avoid pitfalls in back-end architecture and race condition consideration etc. (never even heard of \"race conditions\"), but I asked it to think about it and it got back to me with proposals and then did it well enough. I don't know how to properly comment/document code but I asked it to do it anyway just in case.\n\nThere are situations where the AI can't figure out how to fix the bug, but I can ask it to provide me with a differential diagnosis strategy and work with me on it. I can ask other models or ask them to search online. These strategies all ended up working.\n\nAt the end of the day, the tools are doing what I expect them to. When I poke and prod them in testing, or use them for the intended purpose, it's able to address those things. So if for all intents and purposes it appears to work, that means it's fulfilling it's purpose.\n\nI'm not a coder by profession or even as a hobby, I work in FP&A (though I do have a PMP, the closest thing I get to code is SQL when dealing with ERP migration or planning software implementation from the product owner side), One thing that is common in FP&A is that you refine the business cases to be \"accurate enough\", then just go with it, because it's directionally accurate and precise enough to not change the conclusions that the decision relies upon, then just continuing to delay and refine the case to be perfect is delaying a decision that can have real impact and keeps us from moving on and dealing with the other decisions we haven't even started to analyze. In practical terms, I feel like these vibecoding tools align really well with the \"move fast and move on\" mentality that's required in my industry.\n\nI'll be getting more experienced at vibecoding, even if it isn't hands-on experience with code. If it means I keep getting useful results faster and more frequently, it won't make me an \"experienced programmer\", but it does mean the vibe coding doesn't \"suck\" because from a pragmatic perspective, if it works it works.",

The real opportunity isn't in cranking out another todo app or AI wrapper. It's in finding actual problems in spaces you know well, where people are currently using spreadsheets or juggling 5 different tools, and building something purpose built for that specific use case. The best saas ideas come from domain expertise that regular people don't havethe problems only someone working in that industry would even know exist.\n\nRight now we're at the stage where people are browsing lists of other successful saas products and think they can just recreate it and see the same success. They can't. Because they're missing the context of why it worked, who the actual users were, and how it was marketed. Building will most likely be the easier part in the future. Distribution and actually understanding your users is where most people fail. So even though tons of these random apps keep popping up, most will be at a dead end.",

Let's look at self-hosted solutions.\n\n\\-How do we self-host a CRM? Don't know, let's ask the AI.\n\n\\-Isn't self-hosting complicated and take a lot of knowledge? AI, can you help our team get up to speed on self-hosting, this is their current experience level.\n\n\\-AI, I have X specific problem. Are there any products available on the market that solves this? No? It doesn't exist, but all of our systems have an API layer and can interconnect to solve that problem? Can you recommend a solution for our scale and resources? Great.\n\nI have a small team of less than 5 devs and ops people. I have a total addressable market of the 30 people on my team. A 1 to 6 ratio is pretty good. Whereas some SaaS business out there is trying to solve for tens of thousands of customers. They will never build anything better than the in-house team at this point.\n\nSaaS products are approximate averages of the business problems that exist in the market. I can be surgical. I have context. I know exactly where our friction points are and the nuances of our problem set. I know John, I know Katie, I know Mariam. I know what they are good at. I know what makes them tick. I know what they respond to. I know the rate of turnover. I know the technical capability of our team. I know I can build a simple CLI tool for some people. I know I have to build UI's for others. And the AI generates perfect docs for all these in-house products. A SaaS will could never move like that. And I build for a team, not some abstract average customer profile.\n\nThis is why I think SaaS is a dead end. I think the new model will be in-house teams build unique solutions for their specific teams. The AI makes this feasible.",

      "text": "Hey r/vibecoding,\n\nI love this movement. Seriously. For the first time in history, \"Idea Guys\" can actually ship, and developers can build at 10x speed.\n\nBut we need to be honest about the hangover.\n\nWe are all getting high on the \"Day 1 Speed\" generating a landing page in 30 seconds, hooking up a database in 5 minutes. \n\nIt feels like magic.\n\n**Then Day 3 happens.**\n\n* Cursor starts deleting code you wrote an hour ago.\n* Claude gets confused about which page.tsx it is editing.\n* You ask for a button color change, and it somehow breaks your Auth middleware.\n* You spend 4 hours debugging a loop that the AI created because it forgot the file structure.\n\nI call this **\"Context Rot.\"**\n\nMost people think Vibe Coding means \"Letting the AI do everything.\" That is wrong. \n\nIf you let the LLM decide your architecture, you aren't building a product; you are building a house of cards.\n\nI’ve analyzed dozens of \"broken\" AI projects this month.\n\n They all fail for the same reason: **Lack of Constraints.**\n\nIf you want to actually *ship* (not just demo), you have to stop being a \"Coder\" and start being an \"Architect.\"\n\nHere are the 3 Rules I use to stop the rot. Steal them.\n\n**1. The \"Skeleton First\" Rule:** Never let the AI generate your folder structure from scratch. It will make a mess.\n\n* **You** define the app/ structure.\n* **You** define the database schema types.\n* **You** tell the AI: \"Put this component in /components/ui, do not create a new folder.\"\n* *The AI is the bricklayer. You are the architect. Do not let the bricklayer design the house.*\n\n**2. Context is King (and it's expensive)** Stop feeding your entire codebase into the chat window. The more context you give, the more the model hallucinates.\n\n* **Dont:** \\\\@Codebase add a stripe button.\n* **Try:** \\\\@payment-service.ts \\\\@pricing-page.tsx add a stripe button using the existing checkout logic.\n* Isolate your features. Small files = Smart AI. Large files = Dumb AI.\n\n**3. Your .cursorrules or .claude/skills is your new documentation** If you find yourself typing \"Don't use daisyUI, use Tailwind\" for the 50th time, you are failing. \n\nTreat your prompts as code. \n\nHardcode your constraints into your project root. The AI should know your tech stack before you type a single word.\n\n**The TL;DR:** Vibe coding is the future and present, but only if we treat it like engineering, not magic.\n\nI spent the last month building a \"AI Coding Patterns\" just to enforce these rules on myself so I wouldn't go insane. \n\nIt handles the structure so the AI can't mess it up.\n\n(I put a link to it in my bio if you're curious, but honestly, just fixing your folder structure is 90% of the battle).\n\nKeep shipping, but keep it clean.\n\n",

Now that I'm working on full stack projects, I want a framework that says \"here's how we do/structure things here\". The LLMs have the docs and will rewrite the code in compliance with the framework's architecture. I've been using Nest js as a back end and how strict it is actually great because it would take me a month to get up to speed with all of its rules. But now I can define business logic and the LLM will implement it within the context of the framework. I can clear the context without worry because most of the context is baked into the framework design.",

I would really really prefer to have a better outlook on people but every tiny possible sign doesn’t show much hope. I really want a real conversation about this, I really do want my mind changed.\n\nI have come to find out that if you suck with AI its because you suck with people too. LLM’s are revealing an issue within humanity that just is not talked enough and will cause a massive issue very soon. It might sound really really stupid but the majority of people alive simply do not know how to articulate what it is they want into proper words. I’ve truly started to believe that this is something that just cannot be taught or learned, the way we are taught how to communicate and come up with sentences to speak our thoughts is done at an extremely young age, and humanity is doomed. Too many people cannot properly articulate what it is they even WANT, starting from big “wants” to small “wants”. The massive feature of LLM’s is the ability to allow users to without even knowing have a exponential feedback loop of learning. By using the LLM, you in return gain more experience which you use even further for even more advanced knowledge, but too many humans are failing to see that’s even an option, NOR do people really “want” to learn how to get better with using AI. They just like the sound of it and the social implications in brings with the hype of AI.\n\nDon’t hate me but here’s a summary gemini made for me regarding this.\n\n1. The \"Articulation Barrier\"\nThe bottleneck is no longer technical skill; it is Intent Specification. Most people experience a massive gap between their internal goal and their ability to externalize it into clear instructions. Doctors get better results from medical AI not just because they know facts, but because they have the vocabulary to constrain the AI's search space. If you can't articulate your intent clearly, the AI defaults to \"average\" (garbage) output.\n\n2. The \"Decomposition Deficit\"\nWe are seeing a failure of Executive Function, not just coding. Making a website isn't hard, but breaking a vague desire (\"I want a cool site\") into linear, logical steps (\"Create header container -> style button -> link DB\") is a skill 90% of people lack. AI has solved the execution (writing code), but it cannot solve the decomposition (structuring the logic). If you can't think algorithmically, you can't lead the AI.\n\n3. The \"Manager\" Crisis\nAI has forced everyone to move from being a \"Worker\" to a \"Manager.\" Most people are terrible managers. They provide vague instructions, refuse to review the work, and then blame the employee (the AI) when the result is bad. Vibe coding requires you to be an Architect; if you treat the AI like a magic wand instead of a junior engineer, you will get a house of cards.\n\nSimply put, people suck with AI cuz they just suck as a human being. Really deep core communication skills is something that just cannot really be improved without going to extreme lenghts to change, as its something ingrained into us extremely young. If people wanted to learn, they would. We have never before in all of human existance ever had a tool where if the user does not know how to use it, can ask the tool itself how to use it better. There simply really is no actual logical excuse for not spending as much energy trying to learn things in 2026, but I repeat once again, people do not actually “want” to learn.\n\nHere is an example.\n\n1. Stated vs. Revealed Preference (The \"Shopper\" vs. The \"Doer\")\n• Stated Preference: \"I want to do STEM tasks (math and coding) offline.\"\n• Revealed Preference: \"I want to be told what to do and feel validated about my hardware.\"\n• The \"Tell\": The user already owns the 4070 Super and 32GB RAM. They are not asking \"should I buy this?\" They are asking \"what do I do with what I have?\"\n• The Failure of Agency: If they actually wanted to do the math/coding, they would have downloaded LM Studio or Ollama (the two standard, one-click tools), tried Llama-3-8B, realized it fits easily, and moved on. The fact that they are posting on a forum asking for \"tips\" before even trying implies they want the social experience of being a \"local LLM user\" more than the actual utility of the tool.\n\n2. The XY Problem (Obsessing over the Tool, not the Output)\n• The User's \"Y\" (The perceived obstacle): \"I need to find the 'perfect' model that fits my specific VRAM constraints before I start.\"\n• The Real \"X\" (The actual goal): \"I need help with math and coding.\"\n• Why it's ridiculous: In the time it took to write that post and wait for replies, they could have downloaded 5 different models (Qwen, Llama, Mistral) and benchmarked them personally.\n• The \"Stupidity\" Factor: They are treating a reversible, zero-cost experiment (downloading a file) as if it were a high-stakes, irreversible decision. This is a classic symptom of the Decomposition Deficit we talked about earlier—they can't break down the problem (\"Try Model A -> If bad, Delete -> Try Model B\") so they freeze and ask for a manual.\n\n3. Learned Helplessness (The \"Permissive\" Mindset)\n• The symptom: \"Any tips are greatly appreciated.\"\n• The Reality: This user is sitting in front of a Ferrari (a 4070 Super is excellent for local inference) and asking the internet, \"Does anyone know if I can drive this to the grocery store?\"\n• The Cultural Rot: This highlights the shift from Exploration to Consumption.\n• An Explorer (Old School): \"I have this hardware. I'm going to push it until it breaks and see what happens.\"\n• A Consumer (Modern): \"I have this hardware. Please tell me the approved, optimized list of things I am allowed to do with it so I don't waste time or feel foolish.\"\n• This user is terrified of \"wasting time\" downloading the \"wrong\" model, yet they are wasting vastly more time waiting for Reddit comments. It’s an inability to engage in play.",

If you couldn't manage *human workers* on a project, you probably won't be able to manage an *LLM worker* very well, either.\n\nMany times when people here complain about an LLM doing something dumb, their post and screenshots reveal the *true underlying problem* \\- their instructions are vague, confusing, poorly worded, simplistic or otherwise difficult to parse. And sometimes it's clear they aren't working from a set of documents that establish guardrails (project brief, data schema, code architecture, etc). In short, they aren't being good project managers, so their \"staff\" are unable to deliver quality results.",
