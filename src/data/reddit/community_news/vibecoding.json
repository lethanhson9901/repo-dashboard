Part of the problem with all these people vibe-coding their ideas is that they don't know what they don't know ***and the AI isn't going to tell them because it doesn't either***. \n\nIf I had a dollar for the number of times I've had to explain to a non-technical executive that they're asking for something that is just not technically possible, l'd be able to afford a very nice dinner out for me and my family. I get asked a lot less about these problems now, but I hear about how they're going to happen any day now, just as soon as they can work out how to make the AI understand the idea (as the code keeps not working for some reason).",

But that says more about what problems the English-speaking tech-adjacent world thinks are worth solving than about vibe coding itself.\nHere's what you're missing from your app store vantage point:\n\nWhile you're mocking CRUD apps, someone in Bangalore can finally prototype a transparency system that surfaces bribery patterns in municipal contracts. A teacher in rural Nigeria who never learned syntax can now show exactly how an education delivery system should work. A motivated citizen can build a working demo of how road accident data should flow to actually save lives instead of disappearing into bureaucratic black holes.\n\nThe software industry had 40 years to solve these problems. They didn't. Why? Because children dying of diarrhea in India isn't a profitable market segment.\nVibe coding isn't about replacing senior engineers at Google. It's about giving the prototype pen to the people who actually see the problems—and have been locked out by syntax gatekeeping and software budgets.\nYour critique assumes the only valid apps are the ones that make it to the App Store for Western consumers. That's not a defense of quality. That's a confession of tunnel vision.\n\nThe condescension from devs was never quality control. It was a bottleneck on human imagination. Good riddance.",

You don’t want to unexpectedly hit cost limits, request-per-second caps, or provider quotas. It also helps protect against bad actors using your app as a proxy. Adding alerts when usage approaches a limit would be a nice touch and relatively easy to implement.\n\nContent safety (possibly overkill, but relevant):\n\nSince the app seems mainly focused on kids, you might consider sending the generated result to another LLM (image-to-text) for moderation checks (sexual content, inappropriate text, etc.). Even if you already restrict this in your prompt, a creative user can bypass it. You can’t prevent everything, but you can make a best effort.\n\nAdditional input methods & accessibility:\n\nI added speech support to the UI using the Web Speech API. This allows not only image-based input but also speech-to-image flows. In this case, you’d also need to secure against prompt injection.\n\nPossible flows could be:\n\nspeech → doodle → AI image\n\nspeech → AI image\n\nspeech → style → applied to a doodle\n\nNot all kids are great painters, and having worked with children with disabilities, I think offering multiple input options is important.\n\nGood luck!!",

It also has a book which explains the basic stuff. I am the same as you experienced dev but no hardware exp so the book was quite helpful\n\nEdit: Be wary though, it is so fun that I got a box full of electronics at home now that is full of components used in past prototyping/having fun projects :p like led strips, microphones, various sensors, cables, solder, breadboards, a few arduinos, a few pi picos, etc. lol",

I'll be honest I still don't understand GitHub but it seems to be the spot, keep in mind where I'm coming from is the limewire and bear share days so that shows how out of the loop I am. So I won't even ask a question I'll just present my situation. I sell handcrafted products (I know what you're thinking but I'm not like all of those) and it's taking off pretty well the last year but I need to get a social or online presence and I would like AI to help me with that I had one telling me step by step but I lost it and I can't find it. But I have so many ideas for my business that I would be perfect for and a lot of designing aspects but those apps don't exist and it seems like you guys just make them now. I'm not asking for anyone to hold my hand just asking for a direction. If y'all could point me to a website or just point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it. Most forums were chat rooms is just a lot of bickering and heaven forbid you asked for genuine advice or help. Anyway this is too long already if someone could help I would really be grateful",

      "text": "I have been experimenting with vibecoding for a few months now with GPT and Claude. I have extensive programming experience so I'm good at reading code and understanding how it works and how different pieces come together. I have that shit down pat.\n\nI have been giving ChatGPT and Claude firm instructions on what requirements I have and asking it to work within those requirements. The code almost never works on the first try if it's a complex request but refining the prompts fixes it, but the real danger is when the code seems to work but has logic flaws or security vulnerabilities. \n\nReviewing the code, it often becomes clear the LLMs don't have a full understanding of how the different pieces work together. For example, I recently had an issue that BOTH Claude and GPT couldn't fix until I found what the issue was and told them how to fix it.\n\nThere was a call from a render loop which would get the loading percentage from the background process which was doing the loading. There was another variable for load completion being set to true by the background thread, on the background thread, which would stop the background thread from continuing to run after it hit 100%. The problem was that this was happening before the render loop could read that it was at 100% so the loading never got flagged as complete on the render thread. In situations like this one both Claude and GPT completely failed to debug the problem because they couldn't understand the context. I had to specifically tell them what the problem was and how to fix it.\n\nI really think the issue with AI code is how people will use it without knowing how to read code so they won't know if the output is any good or not.\n\nAt the end of the day, to an experienced programmer, AI ends up just being an overhyped form of auto complete. It speeds things up but relying on it for debugging or generating complex projects for now is still a fools errand.\n\nThose are just my thoughts I'm open to changing my view but I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\n\n ",

The trick is to get a fairly detailed idea put together, then give that outline as a .md to Claude opus 4.5 in plan mode or gpt5.2-high, and then ask it to create a detailed PRD from the outline and break up the workflow into tasks that will be executed by ai agents. Include tests for every step. \n\nYou will end up with a bunch of quick and concise tasks that you can copy and paste into the prompt for cheaper agents to execute.  I like GLM-4.7 for that lately.  The agent will not stop until testing passes and then you move onto the next task.",

          "text": "I was a C or D student in comp sci back around 2005. I was addicted to videogames and wasn't serious about classes. Eventually had a wake-up call that I was never going to be able to fix my fucked up GPA at this point so I might as well just pivot to business and focus (and did well from that point on).\n\nWith my only formal education being 2 years of comp sci (that I barely understood even back then), I had to play the game \"The Farmer Was Replaced\" to even learn the basics again. However, these vibe coding tools still enabled me to get what I want out of them.\n\nFor example, I don't know coding best practices, but I can ask the tool to review for those best practices and apply them. I don't know security best practices, but I can ask it to review for security. I don't know what I don't know so I can't even ask them to address it...so I ask it to red-team the proposed design and tell me what I don't know that I should be considering. I don't know how to avoid pitfalls in back-end architecture and race condition consideration etc. (never even heard of \"race conditions\"), but I asked it to think about it and it got back to me with proposals and then did it well enough. I don't know how to properly comment/document code but I asked it to do it anyway just in case.\n\nThere are situations where the AI can't figure out how to fix the bug, but I can ask it to provide me with a differential diagnosis strategy and work with me on it. I can ask other models or ask them to search online. These strategies all ended up working.\n\nAt the end of the day, the tools are doing what I expect them to. When I poke and prod them in testing, or use them for the intended purpose, it's able to address those things. So if for all intents and purposes it appears to work, that means it's fulfilling it's purpose.\n\nI'm not a coder by profession or even as a hobby, I work in FP&A (though I do have a PMP, the closest thing I get to code is SQL when dealing with ERP migration or planning software implementation from the product owner side), One thing that is common in FP&A is that you refine the business cases to be \"accurate enough\", then just go with it, because it's directionally accurate and precise enough to not change the conclusions that the decision relies upon, then just continuing to delay and refine the case to be perfect is delaying a decision that can have real impact and keeps us from moving on and dealing with the other decisions we haven't even started to analyze. In practical terms, I feel like these vibecoding tools align really well with the \"move fast and move on\" mentality that's required in my industry.\n\nI'll be getting more experienced at vibecoding, even if it isn't hands-on experience with code. If it means I keep getting useful results faster and more frequently, it won't make me an \"experienced programmer\", but it does mean the vibe coding doesn't \"suck\" because from a pragmatic perspective, if it works it works.",

It's still just reimplementing things that already exist but in, probably, a worse way. \n\nI think a really cool follow up post for you would be to have AI analyze existing popular operating systems and try to identify limitations or pain points. Then try to have it address those in your OS implementation. Basically work together with it to try and come up with a truly novel OS, architecture, or paradigm in how OSs work or should be used.

BOOM)\n\nSo far my experience was great, it was quite expensive in time, but in API it wasnt because i was using Google AI Studio and just uploading my entire codebase.txt with the files labeled to the AI, now im looking forward to develop myself with real skills instead of AI and try to get a real job haha, good luck for everyone trying to make these things.\n\nEDIT: I was looking at my old code and i forgot i added a working own file system idk why i called it \"pfs32\" but yeah it works, it has delete, create and etc, might upload to github.",

Vibecode your way to a graphics layer that really speaks to the game / experience you're trying to make. \n\nAt least for the next few years before real time video generation makes raster pipelines a thing of the past :D \n\nWas torn between doing something like this and a path tracing voxel engine or something like that, but this was a bit of a better test project since apart from the choice of rendering buffer it's all pretty vanilla / standard game-dev stuff and utilizing well understood techniques and file formats.",

Like a Q&A type mode where you say something like \"I played X game and things looked like Y, what are techniques that accomplish this\" - explore different ideas, and then implement them and learn about them as you go. \n\nFor example, MSAA is about the dumbest version of antialiasing - in a way starting from a project like this one and modding it is also a good way.  Like hey this goofball made a terminal based game, can we convert it into something that runs on the GPU and looks like whatever.  Then taking it from there and saying, \"how do I add shadows to this\" \n\nSo yeah, I do agree - having a bit of knowledge helps a lot, but to a degree that makes me feel better since I think ultimately these coding agents really reward curiosity at the end of the day.",

I've seen a bunch of those demos of vibe-coded rotating cubes using ASCII art so this was just an experiment to keep pushing it forward. \n\nStarted just as a nominal \"can I render rasterized 3d into the terminal\"",

The best saas ideas come from domain expertise that regular people don't havethe problems only someone working in that industry would even know exist.\n\nRight now we're at the stage where people are browsing lists of other successful saas products and think they can just recreate it and see the same success. They can't. Because they're missing the context of why it worked, who the actual users were, and how it was marketed. Building will most likely be the easier part in the future.

AI, can you help our team get up to speed on self-hosting, this is their current experience level.\n\n\\-AI, I have X specific problem. Are there any products available on the market that solves this? No? It doesn't exist, but all of our systems have an API layer and can interconnect to solve that problem? Can you recommend a solution for our scale and resources? Great.\n\nI have a small team of less than 5 devs and ops people. I have a total addressable market of the 30 people on my team. A 1 to 6 ratio is pretty good. Whereas some SaaS business out there is trying to solve for tens of thousands of customers. They will never build anything better than the in-house team at this point.\n\nSaaS products are approximate averages of the business problems that exist in the market. I can be surgical. I have context. I know exactly where our friction points are and the nuances of our problem set. I know John, I know Katie, I know Mariam. I know what they are good at. I know what makes them tick. I know what they respond to. I know the rate of turnover. I know the technical capability of our team. I know I can build a simple CLI tool for some people. I know I have to build UI's for others. And the AI generates perfect docs for all these in-house products. A SaaS will could never move like that. And I build for a team, not some abstract average customer profile.\n\nThis is why I think SaaS is a dead end.
