I should have left them alone.",

It just feels like every day there’s a new “AI destroyed my X” post, and sometimes it gets framed like the model just randomly decided to go rogue.\n\n\n\nHard truth though: giving any agent full filesystem access without strict scoping, sandboxing, or backups is always a gamble. AI doesn’t act “automagically” it executes within the permissions and environment it’s given. If destructive commands are possible, and something gets malformed (like that PowerShell + cmd /c escaping issue), the system will happily execute it. \n\n\nThat doesn’t mean tooling shouldn’t have better guardrails. It absolutely should. But agent + unrestricted permissions = production-level risk.\nStill, thanks for sharing it. Good reminder for everyone running agents with real access.",

I wanted to test drive some of this agent stuff.  \nHad a CLI tool I'd written and wanted to expand testing for it.  \nThe tool mass renames files in a structured way.  I already has a testing system that generated temporary file trees to run the existing tests on.\n\nWhere this goes is obvious.  But at some point, of course contrary to very explicit instructions, it decided \\*not\\* to use the testing utilities I'd made and instead just run the command on my computer -- wantonly renaming files (and potentially destroying them in the case of after-change name-collisions).\n\nFortunately I caught it very quickly and the nature of the tests and test regexes meant that nothing got damaged.  But it was a useful slap in the face.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nFor my part: I'm still \\*amazed\\* at how little emphasis there has been on sandboxing agents.  \nAgents seem to be most useful when they can run and loop for awhile.  But doing that without hard sandboxing is crazy ... but the norm. I'd expect people to be mentioning how docker/podman/apple-container isn't *enough* security, but instead that's well below most security standards.\n\nThat said: having spent a fair bit of time trying to get nice container setups and then get networking out of container and being able to ssh into container and connect it to IDE etc ... I mostly gave up.  (And gave up on agent coding altogether -- I only use them for examples and syntax or discussing technical questions like  design limitations of pipe buffers). There's just so much friction and time. And enough 'I *think* this works this way'. that it just doesn't feel worth it or safe.  (And, for me, I'd love to hav agents loop on UI stuff -- but now we need graphics working in our containers and ... well, it just didn't feel like a timesaving for me solo.)\n\nInterested to see if/when this changes.",

It’s far easier and lazier to reach for ad hominem and other logical fallacies than to come up with a real argument.\n\nMy post was obviously a joke, but there’s some truth to it. You see countless posts here about being stuck at the last 10% or struggling as projects grow. Those of use who have lived through delivering and supporting real world projects know that getting the code written is a small portion of the job, and by looking at the code that AI produces you can see that its architectural and technical decisions don’t tend to be very strong.\n\nSo you’d probably say something like oh well you should have just specced that all out, and it’s true that AI will do better then (assuming you follow a clear workflow, carefully manage context, and don’t give it too many steps at once), but the reality is that humans aren’t good at speccing out every details and many details (especially edge cases) are only uncovered later, and stakeholders give you ambiguous and vague requirements more often than not.\n\nIf you write a spec that is detailed enough and covers all the edge cases for an AI to do the job without issue, a human could have done it just as well with that spec, and while it might not be done faster, the code writing is the cheapest part of human software development.",

It’s fairly obvious that when you criticize someone for exploring a new way to build, you’re mostly just guarding the ability to create.\nI totally get the frustration. It must be incredibly jarring to spend years mastering complex syntax and struggling through the grind, only to see people bypass that initiation and build things in days. I can see why that feels like a devaluation of the craft. If I saw my specialized role being complemented or challenged by something getting exponentially better every day, I’d probably feel a bit defensive too.\nBut here’s the thing: AI isn't going anywhere. It’s understandable to want to protect the old ways, but the sooner we accept this is the new baseline, the less likely we are to be the ones left behind.\nAlso, a bit of an anecdotal observation: In my time in the industry, I’ve noticed a recurring theme where high level technical skill doesn't always overlap with user facing empathy or visual creativity. That’s usually why PMs exist, right?\nThe fact that creatives can now stumble through the code, messily for now, is clearly disruptive. It’s interesting to see the traditional gatekeepers of the tech stack lose a bit of that exclusive leverage. It’s a major shift in the power dynamic, and while it might be uncomfortable for some, it’s honestly fascinating to watch the prima donna era of dev culture evolve into something more accessible.\nChange is hard, but maybe it's time to embrace the vibe?",

It codes really well, but doesn't know how different services interact and what kinds of obscure bugs there are. Let it make changes in small batches, but always review and control what it does.

I doubt an AI-generated app would put the correct safeguards in place to prevent users from spamming too many API requests as part of their daily use of the app.\n\nThere's also the issue of monetization of traffic/map data, which the Apple maps TOS seems to cover via licensing. Again, not something AI is usually aware of when generating apps, given how often AI-generated apps violate TOS/EULAs of APIs they're intended to interact with.\n\nLastly, if they intend to expand the app to other platforms, they'll have to pay more for Apple Maps API access, since the free quota is only available for iOS/macOS apps. At that point they'd need to rewrite it to use a different traffic API that is more cross-platform friendly in terms of TOS, to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience.",

          "text": "r/webdev • Posted by u/SecurityAudit\nSite got a 50/100 on HTTP Observatory. Am I cooked? (Analysis of dropapp.app)\n\nHey everyone, just ran site dropapp.app through the Mozilla HTTP Observatory and... it’s not looking great. I’m sitting at a 50/100.\n\nI took a look at my raw headers, and it seems like I’m missing some \"defense-in-depth\" basics. I wanted to break down exactly how an attacker could actually pivot from these missing headers to stealing my database or API keys.\n\nIf you’re a beginner, take this as a cautionary tale on why headers aren't just \"extra credit.\"\n\n1. The \"Open Door\" Policy (Missing CSP)\nMy report shows zero Content Security Policy (CSP).\n * The Attack: This is the big one. If I have a single unsanitized input field, an attacker can perform a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.\n * The Breach: Without a CSP, the browser will happily run any script the attacker injects. They can script a \"scraper\" that runs in an admin's browser, finds the \"Settings\" page where my AWS or Stripe API keys are displayed, and sends them straight to their own server.\n\n2. Clickjacking (Missing X-Frame-Options)\nI noticed I don't have X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors.\n * The Attack: An attacker can load my site inside an invisible <iframe> on their malicious site.\n * The Breach: They can trick me (the admin) into clicking a button on their site that perfectly aligns with a \"Delete Database\" or \"Reset Admin Password\" button on my hidden site. It’s a classic UI redressing attack.\n\n3. Cookie Hijacking\nThe scan flagged that my session cookies likely aren't hardened (missing HttpOnly and Secure flags).\n * The Attack: If that XSS attack from step 1 works, the attacker can just run document.cookie.\n * The Breach: If my session ID is in there, they can just copy-paste it into their own browser and poof—they are logged in as me. Once they have admin access, the database is essentially theirs to download.\n\n4. Infrastructure Leaks\nMy headers are being a bit too chatty:\n * X-Served-By: cache-bfi-krnt7300081-BFI\n * Server-Timing: cfOrigin;dur=8\n * The Risk: This tells attackers exactly which edge nodes and origin behaviors I'm using. It’s like giving a burglar a blueprint of which windows in your house have the weakest locks.\n\nThe Game Plan to Fix It:\nI'm going to start by injecting these into my config:\n * Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): (Already there, but needs a long max-age).\n * Content-Security-Policy: Even a basic default-src 'self' would do wonders.\n * X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff: To stop MIME-sniffing exploits.\n * X-Frame-Options: DENY: No iframes allowed.\nHas anyone else dealt with a 50/100 score? What was the first \"critical\" header you fixed that actually stopped a real-world probe?\n\nTL;DR: My site is currently a playground for XSS and Session Hijacking because I’m missing basic security headers. Fixing them tonight before my API keys end up on a pastebin.",

Or just use google to ingest their existing data, but that introduces lots of issues and bottle necks IMO.\n\nMy concept was even likely easier in the data collection arena as my data was meant to be user submitted; essentially you go to a bar and you can report to others all the relevant info like how crowded, cover amount, type of music, etc..\n\nGood luck, I hope you overcome the hurdles I ran into!",

Super positive response talking to people tonight. I got 18 downloads by just talking to people. People coming up to the banners. Still, there are real challenges converting but not bad. The density chicken & egg problem is real. \n\nDrop is an incredible app. I hope you all try it out. The app continues to get more and more downloads. Running on so little sleep these past few days. Got to do it all again tomorrow and just keep going. Every week. Pivoting and learning. How can we get to the finish line to get one area of density so the value is immediately clear? \n\nYou learn as you go. I am learning how to convert in person and the different challenges. Thinking of the growth methods every hour and hacks. It’s all coming along. \n\nA conversation struck me tonight as I was out. A man from the UK had rolled by my sign and stopped. He said, “this is a fantastic idea. I came out tonight but everywhere it’s so busy. I would love to know which places aren’t busy right now.” We talked for a while. It was so interesting how this app could help someone like him. He had mentioned that he’s also autistic, and knowing how busy a place is beforehand would be incredible for him. He tried to download the app but it’s only on iOS 🤣🤣. \n\nSuccess isn’t guaranteed. This will be a monumental challenge. May God be with us. I want to ask people to not leave fake reviews because they’re angry about whatever they think Drop implies. It’s hurtful to leave a review lying about the app to try and kill it. The app works. It’s been tested through hundreds of hours of real world scenarios. I went through so much to make this. I have a real family. Leaving a fake review to hurt me does hurt me. It’s evil. You can download the app and see that the app works, that the geofencing works, that it’s impressively accurate in many situations (not everyone of them) and we could talk about that if the app makes it mainstream, but come on. You’re not just hurting me. \n\nRooting for me to fail is okay, fine, but actively playing a role in it happening is pure vitriol. \n\nLet’s keep winning! This is wartime stuff. Whether Drop succeeds or not, it won’t fail because I refused to fight until the end. \n\nHoorah!",

Example:\n\n\"Write a Python function that monitors a directory for new CSV files, and when one appears, validates it against a schema (columns: name, email, amount), logs any malformed rows to an error file, and moves valid rows into a SQLite database. Use a polling loop with a processed-files set so it doesn't re-process. Include graceful shutdown on SIGINT.\"\n\nYou can write that if you want I got other shit to do.",

Dont let them confuse you, for me it seems like there are ways to get better outputs faster but I am still on a journey to improve the process, I am just now much more aware of what the level of quality I can expect and how to find ways to work with that, but just ignore the people who say they are building full products over the weekend with no coding skills, they are building something else and operating in a different way then what professional dev work looks like, just look at other companies and agencies in your domain of work, if they start getting 10x outputs and you are not, then its tome to worry about it, but comparing your experience and seeing what AI was able to do in your use case vs someone with zero prior experience and skills to judge the quality of the output is definitely a loosng game.

I exclusively use Cursor so here are a few things that got me out of the quagmire:\n\nUse rules - this was my first step. I had Cursor generate rules based on my feedback so I only had to correct it once. Rules are supposed to be applied automatically but I’ve found that explicitly @ rule will reinforce \n\nSegregate Duties into Agents - dedicate agents to specific tasks giving each agent greater context by pointing them at specific rules and docs. I have a dedicated UI/UX agent, a bug fix agent, a docs agent and a feature builder agent. This keeps the agent focused and has driven better results. \n\nUse Commands - to automate task such as /mystartofday, /mypush, /mysync, /mytest, /myrelease. You can highlight what to do and in what order giving you a better workflow and keep you disciplined. \n\nUse BugBot - for checking code and function feedback.  Again, make sure to create and maintain your bugbot rules to make it more effective. \n\nThe great thing about all these rules and docs is that Cursor can create and maintain them as you go, you just need to remind it every so often to “add that learning to the doc” and “what can we learn from this conversation that should be in our docs?”  \n\nI regularly run up to 5 parallel Cursor windows, each on its own branch using the specialist agents and do about 15 releases per day.\n\nEstablish the rules, but back it up with good docs and discipline. \n\nJust my two cents worth…",

I also if it’s a more complicated project, ask it to make a road map that it keeps updated with progress in the route of the folder. I give it the URL to that file and I’ve already created that file with a comment at the beginning of the file saying put the roadmap here. \n\nMy last project I did that almost exact instructions set on the end yet and it worked quite well. I also had a large PDF, which I had used ChatGPT to come up with a PRD and a game plan of how best to implement what I want to do for this project and I gave it that URL also.  I find that ChatGPT or Grok do a better plan of action than Claude not to mention I don’t want to waste my tokens on making the plan with Claude.\n\nThis is allowed me to make one ready to ship iOS app and one android app not tested yet that looks good in theory in about a week  I’ve also done three websites that are sass based on this this week. \n\nGood luck but having phases or a plan of action what will get done first next next and next makes Claude much smarter  It’s amazing how well it can code now.",

If you are raising money, the stakes go up because you need to attract investors, usually by providing some rational evidence of your chances of success.\n\nAnd still the majority fail.\n\nNow, a single person with absolutely no business skill, no past history of running companies… can vibecode an app in a week and put it on the App Store… all without doing marketing plans, having the funding to support it, market analysis, and a huge number of other things that ensure success.\n\nI think this will make those numbers go way up.  In the software arena, we may see 99% failure being the norm.\n\nYet, now and then there is a single person who really knows what they are doing… has good business sense, experience, understands the numbers… just could never figure out how to get a engineering team that could do it the way they wanted.

          "text": "It's ironic that the failure rate of vibecoders is much _higher_ than the statistics collected from traditional business trends in the US, even higher than modern startups. \n\nThis is partly because things which would normally have died on the vine as \"ideas\" are being built and published. \n\nAI tools have simply removed some of the friction to putting a software based idea into the world. \n\nUnfortunately, the AI tools have NO IDEA whether your idea is good. \n\nOnly real humans can tell you that. And the best way to ask them — before building anything at all — is to do messy IRL casual Customer Discovery style learning. \n\nBut many vibecoders are specifically trying to avoid that kind of real work. They'd rather spend their dollars on LLMs and their days vibing than spend a few hours testing their assumptions with humans. \n\nIf you want to create value for humans, start with the humans, and learn how to vet your own thoughts by doing r/CustomerDiscovery. This is the beginning of the Customer Development process and r/LeanStartup methodology. This is how we find r/ProductMarketFit. \n\nAnd the latest trend to focus on \"distribution\" is a bit silly as well. It feels like a new pet word for an old fundamental that the vibers have only just discovered. Everyone seems to be looking for another shortcut to it. Distribution is being sought through tricks and tips like engineering virality. \n\nInstead, the Customer Development method reveals an emergent sales and marketing process by taking us to the humans themselves, learning how they think, feel, talk, and behave around the problem/solution space we want to enter. You can literally reverse engineer your \"distribution\" by actually talking to your customers and learning how they already behave and buy. \n\nMost vibecoders appear to have no understanding about business fundamentals. Those haven't changed! If you're just repeatedly launching projects without doing any real discovery or validation work, you're just playing lottery.\n\nThe vibecoders who win in today's market will be those who use LLMs for what they're good at, but don't try to use them as shortcuts for a variety of things they simply cannot do. \n\nLLMs cannot do customer discovery for you. They'll pretend to, but they don't know what your customers will feel, think, or do. Same with marketing and sales  stuff. If you think they can, you're being fooled by a pattern matching algo. \n\nLLMs are trained on the past. We're building the future.",

This is something that folks constantly fail to understand, and one of the signs that they’ve never really done customer discovery. Or they’ve done a quick version of it and didn’t fully understand it. \n\nProduct market fit is only one of the fits we are seeking. Or perhaps a better way to say that is that r/productmarketfit includes all of these other things, or should. While learning from real humans, we should also be deriving our marketing messaging, channel placements, narrative patterns, key words and phrases, price points, anticipated objections, indirect competitor intel, and much more.\n\nWe can and should do all of that before building anything at all. But if you’ve already built something, it’s not too late to go back and do real customer discovery work to figure out the rest. And if in the process of doing discovery and validation experiments, you discover nobody wants the thing you built, the discovery work will reveal to you something else that you should be working on instead. \n\nIf you ever feel like you are guessing about any of your sales and marketing, content or process, let it be a big red flag that you are not meaningfully connected to the people for whom you seek to create value.",

I've been using Cursor and then switched to fully cli agent in few months ago and have used to to help with more than just development, like brainstorming branding and content ideas for marketing.  \n  \nI don't have any paid users yet, but I had the agent (I actually made my own claude code competitor called sweet! cli) help me set up google search console and analytics and in the past months i've had about 50 visitors and 10+ signups from users who were interested in trying to product. \n\nI know at this point its just a numbers game and I can have the agent analyze its own growth data over time to create a ***feedback loop*** that legitimately drives new revenue growth.   \n  \nI mean, the AI model companies are using agents in a feedback loop of self improvement, why can't you use a model in a feedback loop with your app?

Vibe coding operates similarly, just without the \"borrowing\" aspect. Even Elon Musk's first venture, Zip2, was reportedly a mess according to professional developers yet he sold it successfully. That's essentially vibe coding in spirit.\n\n\nThe reality is, agencies and individuals are already using this technology to accelerate development and generate revenue. Many more will follow.",

I've taken your advice to heart and made updates to my presentation as recommended.\n\nEvery morning on a construction site, before anyone touches a tool, the crew fills out a FLRA, a Field Level Risk Assessment. It's a multi-page safety form: project info, a pre-job safety checklist, PPE checks, task/hazard/control breakdowns, and then every worker signs it. On paper. With gloves on. In the cold. Every. Single. Day.\n\nI've been doing this for years and it's always the same story. Guys rushing through it, writing the same answers they wrote yesterday, forms getting lost or soaked, supervisors chasing down paperwork at the end of the week. The forms matter (safety is no joke), but the process is broken.\n\nSo I built HrdHat, a web app that lets crews fill out their daily safety forms on their phone, tablet, or whatever they've got. It's live at hrdhat.site.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sll44829gsjg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=14264124712dd1eb8cd264067a4e111bdbcac43a\n\nWhat does HrdHat do for workers and supervisors:\n\n* Covers the full FLRA: general info, pre-job checklist, PPE & platform checks, task/hazard/control entries, crew signatures, and even job site photos (Note: the next major feature I want to work on is uploadable form templates)\n* Completely free for workers right now\n* Recall feature. Hit one button and it pre-fills sections based on what you entered last time. Because if you're pouring concrete on the same site all week, your hazards aren't changing much\n* Generates a clean, professional PDF that looks just like the paper version supervisors are used to seeing\n* As a worker, you can be added to a project and send forms directly to it for supervisor review\n* Built for the field. Big touch targets for gloved hands, works on mobile, high contrast for outdoor visibility\n* Workers sign right on their phone screen\n\nFor supervisors, there's a separate dashboard at supervisor.hrdhat.site:\n\n* 90-day free trial of all features\n* Create and manage projects\n* Log notes throughout the day like a digital journal. Capture what's happening on site in real time\n* Generate daily reports with AI based on your notes and site activity\n* Automatic form sorting. Workers email their completed forms to a project-specific address and they're automatically received and sorted into the right folders (FLRA, Hot Work Permits, Confined Space, etc.). No manual filing. Any form from any app should be able to be sorted into the proper folder\n* Anything the AI can't confidently classify lands in an \"Unsorted\" tab for quick manual review\n* Add workers to a project and review their submitted forms all from one place\n* Other tools for you to play with\n\nWhat's my goal for the future:\n\nLearn, polish, rinse, repeat. Eventually I want to turn this into a mobile app. I just found out you need an Apple device to publish to the App Store, so that's a fun discovery. Trying to see if I can start generating income from this.\n\nThe stack (for the curious): React + Vite + TypeScript on the frontend, Supabase (Postgres + Edge Functions) on the backend, Zustand for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, deployed on Vercel.\n\nI vibe coded this entire thing. I'm a tradesperson, not a software engineer. I used Cursor as my IDE and leaned heavily on AI throughout the build. Architecture decisions, component design, database schema, edge functions, security hardening, all of it. The AI was my co-pilot from day one. I wrote the requirements and the vision because I live this problem every day, and the AI helped me turn it into a real product.\n\nIt's not done. Still a bunch of polish to go. But it's live and functional. If you work in construction or know someone who does, I'd genuinely love feedback.",

Most people talk about “learning to code one day”, you just went and shipped a whole system on top of a job that already fries your brain and body.\n\nI had kind of the opposite story. I come from the tech side and tried to build internal tools for our ops team the “proper” way, with frameworks and all that. It took forever and everyone hated waiting on me. Weirdly enough I ended up in a similar place to you, using AI to speed up the boring parts and treating the tools more like something I can tweak fast instead of some giant enterprise project.\n\nOne thing that helped me a lot once things got more serious was moving my “vibe coded” logic onto a proper database and using a builder on top of it. In my case that was UI Bakery on top of Postgres. It still feels a bit like vibe coding because the AI helps scaffold screens and flows, but it is easier to keep stuff tidy when more people are using it.\n\nEither way, you should be proud of this. Most devs never ship something that real for their own workplace. You did it while swinging a hammer all day.",

I used to type out my code  else and then paste it in chat gpt to fix. Then learned about cursor. Cursor was huge for me. \n\nI kept learning and learning, but I ended up restarting completely three different times because I had some fundamental architectural issues with how I was structuring my code and generating documents.  So i would say knowing the architecture and what tech stack you want was very important. \n\nMy big “aha” moment was realizing how powerful JSON is.

Unless we shift to a purely competitive economic model where everyone is making their own products (at which point why even buy software if your AI agents can make the same) then we’ll always need review.\n\nFirst, modern corporate models are built on bureaucracy and ownership at multiple levels. Executives love having someone to blame for failures and taking credit on successes. Agents directly to executives removes that layer and forces legal accountability on them. AI companies don’t want liability on AI, they want it on users.\n\nSecond, review ensures the final product is free of bugs and exploits. Again, this is necessary for both quality and final ownership for liabilities.\n\nLastly, if we do somehow shift to having AI do the full process then the only products are AI, hardware, and renting compute products for software development and creation. Why would I ever pay for software let alone a development and finance team? If AI does everything then I would just get an AI agent and not software.",

Lots of stuff that devs do today will be delegated to product owners, domain specialists, etc. It's a brave new world, but I don't see much future in being a vibe coder, either. For sure, in very short order, the window will close and almost nobody's going to make any money from vibe coding anything. Maybe 1 in 10,000 vibe coders. ",

Yes, AI is not going to replace you now, but we forget that it's learning. All these issues are being worked on, conversations like this one are feeding it, and what do you think will eventually happen? Let's be real, do you think you'll be able to fix AI code for the rest of your life? I think it's still too early to come up with conclusions. And note, there's no finish line, and funny enough, it will outlive us all. By 2100, it will be here: better, bigger, and probably running the world.\n​Build what you want, whenever you want. Do not be afraid to fail, and don't be afraid to build a messy product. You don't actually need to build something that scales; you might have to manually onboard your first users. If you need to scale, you will have figured it out, and you'll be able to hire someone to fix what you want. The moment we all stop complaining about AI and it's super easy to build, you probably won't need to build, enjoy the ride..",

Around 100,000 LoC that does exactly that written over the last month, LoC seen by me: still zero.\n\nAnd saying the AI agent “does not have the tools” is a pretty nonsensical statement.

              "text": "At this point, anything is just speculation. I have been developing for something like 15 years now, both on high level languages and low level languages. There are many paradigms, many ways to achieve objectives, each with very specific constraints depending on your target: customer facing, on a browser, on a cellphone, on a scanning device, in an elevator, on a smart watch...\n\nMy opinion is that LLMs replacing human devs is comparable to modern tools replacing craftsmen. They will impact the industry, and it will shift focus towards higher level thinking, but in the end you still need people that understand how to use the tools and what they do (what manual tasks they are making easier or replacing). Otherwise, you're relying on blind luck, hoping for the best.\n\nThe gist of it is that LLMs are, at their core, language models iterating on a growing context and deducting what the next plausible word (or more precisely token) should be in the output. As such, they are prone to giving very convincing answers (code) that do not necessarily do what you thought they would.\nThey might not handle the edge cases they should. They often \"forget\" crucial information, or are not scared to completely erase your hard drive because they do not understand what erasing a hard drive means: they just write words with a really high statistical significance, increasing the odds of making it useful to such a high level that actual intelligence emerges. Not intelligence in the sense of a human thinking, but intelligence in the sense of a system organizing, like millions of coin tosses will end up resulting close to a 50/50 chance, seemingly perfect. \n\nIn the case of LLMs, the probabilities have been calculated by ingesting content from the internet, answers which may be right as much as they may be wrong. Documentation is scarce, sometimes outdated. Source code evolves fast. People give wrong answers all the time. A very well formed and convincing answer can always be false: that's what we're used to deal with when talking to humans. This, however, is not usually the case when we are using tools. Tools should always give the same output for a given input. LLMs do not do that.\n\nUp until now, the proposed solution for convergence towards predictable outputs has been to increase the size of and encode context, and use even more energy to calculate outputs and iterate on them. Even this is not perfect, and ultimately LLMs need review and guidance.\n\nInvesting more energy might not be viable in the long term as LLMs become even more standard in the industry. They might become too costly to be mainstream due to these constraints. Even if LLMs  review each other, non-deterministic behaviour in their outputs can lead them to stray from their objectives and make it increasingly harder to understand what went wrong and when.\n\nReviewing output becomes increasingly difficult as you grow further away from the actual coding. People would lose skills and reflexes that are vital today to our coding ecosystems. For instance, a big part of our tooling depends on really clever people building (on top of) open source libraries. When these libraries become unreliable and the people maintaining them become unable to precisely estimate how, why, and when it can be fixed, the balance will be thrown off with potentially cascading consequences (as already happens from time to time from human error).\n\nUltimately, if you had all the time and resources in the world, maybe none of this would matter. But when people are held accountable for the success of their projects, when you have deadlines, when you have customers telling you that something you had working yesterday is not working today anymore and you need to answer something else than: \"my LLM did it, it's very sorry and now it's telling me it's probably due to something I don't understand so neither can you\", well, you need humans that know what is going on",

I'm thinking of passion projects about forgotten franchises, books that never got a chance, videogame adaptations that Hollywood would never spend a dime on. Imagine you already have a storyboard with a specific vision, someone put thought in camera motion, photography, colors, costumes, lighting, sound and music. Then you generate through AI a small scene over and over, adjusting each time until it suits the original vision. Idk, I might be too optimistic about it, but I seriously have faith in fans and small communities. \n\n\nCan't wait for the home-made adaptation of Dishonored, the game.",

Some people with 5 PC's vs an industry that can build industrial sized render farms, and a team of whatever size they need for managing the output of prompts, which in theory would be a fraction of what they pay VFX houses and actors for. Lets say in this future with no more cameras, they still can make deals with famous actors and pay them to train the models for the movie specifically getting enough voice and face data. Current laws even would be enough to prevent an average person from using anything that mimics an actor or anything that looks like existing IP, so you're still back in indie territory. People make shorts with pretty impressive VFX now, some having millions of YouTube subs and able to make a living off it - but its not really the end of Hollywood is it.",

If everyone else in between gets replaced, the top layer is cooked as well.\n\nAlso, lot of super stars once started out at the bottom in less glamorous roles, or with very cheap productions.

What happens when you have a good script writer or team that pays attention to detail and corrects or edits things like the Cybertruck? I think we've got to be real about things produced for mass consumption. Machines can now do it. The human realm is performance art.
