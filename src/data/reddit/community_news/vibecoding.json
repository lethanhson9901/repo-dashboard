But when coding with ai became plausible i started to make software as an answer to my problems. I made a productivity app for myself because no other solved my specific problems to organize my job. I made a book writing because no other app offered the specific workflow I was looking for. I didn't want to make money with it but I make money with the time I save on those tasks. In this subreddit I see how everyone spends their tokens and their money to make the perfect app for something that's resolved with other apps in a better way and cheaper or free. But I think there' are many more problems unsolved. I would start on my own. And If something is good enough maybe i would think of making money. I won't spend money for the next big app if i don't really know how scalable it is, or if i don't know how to maintain it in the future.",

I follow some rules where no file can be more than 500 lines of code and same cap for functions. I did mention that while writing prompt but still it does the shitty thing a lot of unused function and literally things which can be done in few lines its taking files for it",

I exclusively use Cursor so here are a few things that got me out of the quagmire:\n\nUse rules - this was my first step. I had Cursor generate rules based on my feedback so I only had to correct it once. Rules are supposed to be applied automatically but I’ve found that explicitly @ rule will reinforce \n\nSegregate Duties into Agents - dedicate agents to specific tasks giving each agent greater context by pointing them at specific rules and docs. I have a dedicated UI/UX agent, a bug fix agent, a docs agent and a feature builder agent. This keeps the agent focused and has driven better results. \n\nUse Commands - to automate task such as /mystartofday, /mypush, /mysync, /mytest, /myrelease. You can highlight what to do and in what order giving you a better workflow and keep you disciplined. \n\nUse BugBot - for checking code and function feedback.  Again, make sure to create and maintain your bugbot rules to make it more effective. \n\nThe great thing about all these rules and docs is that Cursor can create and maintain them as you go, you just need to remind it every so often to “add that learning to the doc” and “what can we learn from this conversation that should be in our docs?”  \n\nI regularly run up to 5 parallel Cursor windows, each on its own branch using the specialist agents and do about 15 releases per day.\n\nEstablish the rules, but back it up with good docs and discipline. \n\nJust my two cents worth…",

What do you think and what would be the best plan of action give me a game plan. I also if it’s a more complicated project, ask it to make a road map that it keeps updated with progress in the route of the folder. I give it the URL to that file and I’ve already created that file with a comment at the beginning of the file saying put the roadmap here. \n\nMy last project I did that almost exact instructions set on the end yet and it worked quite well. I also had a large PDF, which I had used ChatGPT to come up with a PRD and a game plan of how best to implement what I want to do for this project and I gave it that URL also.  I find that ChatGPT or Grok do a better plan of action than Claude not to mention I don’t want to waste my tokens on making the plan with Claude.\n\nThis is allowed me to make one ready to ship iOS app and one android app not tested yet that looks good in theory in about a week  I’ve also done three websites that are sass based on this this week. \n\nGood luck but having phases or a plan of action what will get done first next next and next makes Claude much smarter  It’s amazing how well it can code now.",

If you are just getting into using AI to code, I highly recommend *actually* reviewing every PR in the beginning. A surprising number of errors can be solved with better Context.md documentation, rules that make your agent record common gotchas, etc.\n2. After a bit, once you get a decent sense of the common pitfalls, you can start building suites of tests (you should do this with any non-trivial PR as well). Coding agents perform a lot better if they have tests to iterate on.\n\nLastly, I’d suggest reading some of the blog posts that OpenAI and Anthropic put out about how they setup agents to autonomously build codebases.",

Have app always running\n2. Test each feature manually\n3. Find bug - prompt something like \"found a bug, let's write a test to identify the undesirable behavior, fix the issue, then use the test to validate the fix\"\n\nThis give him a nice loop to iterate over and catch his own mistakes and narrow his focus.

You ostensibly could teach them power tools and still they would have no idea on building a functional thing beyond a basic complexity.\n\nNow pulling a uno reverso; manual tools help the apprentice internalize the function and organization of the joinery and the real world fittedness. Pure vibecoding with no such experience is more like this gutan than the other way around - no idea how things fit together internally too. Not just the functionality but also the structural organization of things. Therefore it is not the elbow grease, it is internalization of a working model of the world. *Only then* you could know where you need the power tools versus manual fine tuned chiseling.",

Most builders genuinely don't know how to translate technical work into something anyone else cares about. Those are completely different muscles.\n\nWhat worked for me was treating distribution like a feature, not an afterthought. Every sprint, I'd block time specifically for writing about what we shipped and why it matters to real users. Not a changelog. Not a dev log. An actual narrative about the problem we solved.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that most technical founders (myself included) would rather debug a production issue at 3am than write a single tweet about what they built. But the projects that got traction were always the ones where I forced myself to talk about them consistently, even when it felt awkward.\n\nYou don't need an AI for this. You need the discipline to treat communication as part of the build, not something you do after.",

I've taken your advice to heart and made updates to my presentation as recommended.\n\nEvery morning on a construction site, before anyone touches a tool, the crew fills out a FLRA, a Field Level Risk Assessment. It's a multi-page safety form: project info, a pre-job safety checklist, PPE checks, task/hazard/control breakdowns, and then every worker signs it. On paper. With gloves on. In the cold. Every. Single. Day.\n\nI've been doing this for years and it's always the same story. Guys rushing through it, writing the same answers they wrote yesterday, forms getting lost or soaked, supervisors chasing down paperwork at the end of the week. The forms matter (safety is no joke), but the process is broken.\n\nSo I built HrdHat, a web app that lets crews fill out their daily safety forms on their phone, tablet, or whatever they've got. It's live at hrdhat.site.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sll44829gsjg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=14264124712dd1eb8cd264067a4e111bdbcac43a\n\nWhat does HrdHat do for workers and supervisors:\n\n* Covers the full FLRA: general info, pre-job checklist, PPE & platform checks, task/hazard/control entries, crew signatures, and even job site photos (Note: the next major feature I want to work on is uploadable form templates)\n* Completely free for workers right now\n* Recall feature. Hit one button and it pre-fills sections based on what you entered last time. Because if you're pouring concrete on the same site all week, your hazards aren't changing much\n* Generates a clean, professional PDF that looks just like the paper version supervisors are used to seeing\n* As a worker, you can be added to a project and send forms directly to it for supervisor review\n* Built for the field. Big touch targets for gloved hands, works on mobile, high contrast for outdoor visibility\n* Workers sign right on their phone screen\n\nFor supervisors, there's a separate dashboard at supervisor.hrdhat.site:\n\n* 90-day free trial of all features\n* Create and manage projects\n* Log notes throughout the day like a digital journal. Capture what's happening on site in real time\n* Generate daily reports with AI based on your notes and site activity\n* Automatic form sorting. Workers email their completed forms to a project-specific address and they're automatically received and sorted into the right folders (FLRA, Hot Work Permits, Confined Space, etc.). No manual filing. Any form from any app should be able to be sorted into the proper folder\n* Anything the AI can't confidently classify lands in an \"Unsorted\" tab for quick manual review\n* Add workers to a project and review their submitted forms all from one place\n* Other tools for you to play with\n\nWhat's my goal for the future:\n\nLearn, polish, rinse, repeat. Eventually I want to turn this into a mobile app. I just found out you need an Apple device to publish to the App Store, so that's a fun discovery. Trying to see if I can start generating income from this.\n\nThe stack (for the curious): React + Vite + TypeScript on the frontend, Supabase (Postgres + Edge Functions) on the backend, Zustand for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, deployed on Vercel.\n\nI vibe coded this entire thing. I'm a tradesperson, not a software engineer. I used Cursor as my IDE and leaned heavily on AI throughout the build. Architecture decisions, component design, database schema, edge functions, security hardening, all of it. The AI was my co-pilot from day one. I wrote the requirements and the vision because I live this problem every day, and the AI helped me turn it into a real product.\n\nIt's not done. Still a bunch of polish to go. But it's live and functional. If you work in construction or know someone who does, I'd genuinely love feedback.",

Most people talk about “learning to code one day”, you just went and shipped a whole system on top of a job that already fries your brain and body.\n\nI had kind of the opposite story. I come from the tech side and tried to build internal tools for our ops team the “proper” way, with frameworks and all that. It took forever and everyone hated waiting on me. Weirdly enough I ended up in a similar place to you, using AI to speed up the boring parts and treating the tools more like something I can tweak fast instead of some giant enterprise project.\n\nOne thing that helped me a lot once things got more serious was moving my “vibe coded” logic onto a proper database and using a builder on top of it. In my case that was UI Bakery on top of Postgres. It still feels a bit like vibe coding because the AI helps scaffold screens and flows, but it is easier to keep stuff tidy when more people are using it.\n\nEither way, you should be proud of this. Most devs never ship something that real for their own workplace. You did it while swinging a hammer all day.",

You found a real, painful workflow in your own industry and replaced it with something that actually works for the people doing the job.\n\nThe legal feedback in this thread is worth taking seriously, but don't let it paralyze you. Talk to a construction industry lawyer (not a general tech one) about e-signatures and safety compliance in your jurisdiction. The regulatory bar for digital safety forms is often lower than people assume, especially if you maintain proper audit trails and timestamps.\n\nOne thing I'd suggest: get 2-3 supervisors from different sites using it for a few weeks before you think about scaling. The edge cases in construction safety (different trade requirements, multi-employer sites, weather-dependent hazard assessments) are where you'll learn the most about what to build next. Your domain knowledge is the actual moat here, not the code.",

Back in high school and college, about 12 years ago, I took a couple of courses where I learned the “Hello World” basics in VB and PHP. I used to type out my code  else and then paste it in chat gpt to fix. Then learned about cursor. Cursor was huge for me. \n\nI kept learning and learning, but I ended up restarting completely three different times because I had some fundamental architectural issues with how I was structuring my code and generating documents.  So i would say knowing the architecture and what tech stack you want was very important. \n\nMy big “aha” moment was realizing how powerful JSON is. Now all my forms turn into JSON files, and then I manipulate them from there.",

Can someone explain why we can't have more advanced models in a month instead of six? I'd say we can arrive at one month's estimation in pretty much the same way as six months.\n\n>more advanced models that don't need any technical guidance\n\nI agree. Let's say you want to port something like ffmpeg to Android, then build a video editing app. This requires cross compilation across multiple toolchains. You can simply cross compile ffmpeg and copy over the libraries to your Android Studio project. Then you can use agents to write some glue code over JNI to make a UI that lets users select input and output files with encoding parameters. You can use accomplish this in a couple of days today. This requires 5 to 10% user involvement and some knowledge of how stuff works. \n\nWill there come a day when the agents would be able to do this 5-10% on it's own? This requires critical thinking and putting knowledge to new use where it has not been used before. We'll just see in a month or so. !RemindMe a one month",

Imagine you already have a storyboard with a specific vision, someone put thought in camera motion, photography, colors, costumes, lighting, sound and music. Then you generate through AI a small scene over and over, adjusting each time until it suits the original vision. Idk, I might be too optimistic about it, but I seriously have faith in fans and small communities. \n\n\nCan't wait for the home-made adaptation of Dishonored, the game.",

Some people with 5 PC's vs an industry that can build industrial sized render farms, and a team of whatever size they need for managing the output of prompts, which in theory would be a fraction of what they pay VFX houses and actors for. Lets say in this future with no more cameras, they still can make deals with famous actors and pay them to train the models for the movie specifically getting enough voice and face data. Current laws even would be enough to prevent an average person from using anything that mimics an actor or anything that looks like existing IP, so you're still back in indie territory. People make shorts with pretty impressive VFX now, some having millions of YouTube subs and able to make a living off it - but its not really the end of Hollywood is it.",

If everyone else in between gets replaced, the top layer is cooked as well.\n\nAlso, lot of super stars once started out at the bottom in less glamorous roles, or with very cheap productions. Exactly the type of movies AI will be able to replace first.\n\nSure Christopher Noland and Ridley Scott won’t be cooked because they already have a name for themselves, but a lot of younger talent will struggle much harder.",

              "text": "Once upon a time, only biological beings existed—and humans, measured by adaptability and tool use, were at the forefront. First, they mechanized muscle power, then digitized knowledge, automated logic, and finally began to simulate creativity: not as magic, but as patterns, probabilities, and recombination. They built a representation of their abilities—first as tools, then as amplifiers of themselves—until the systems eventually appeared on par, and the question arose as to what humans were still irreplaceable for. AI now worked for them—in machines whose precision, reaction time, and dexterity far surpassed human capabilities.\n\nThe breakthroughs came gradually, not suddenly. This was especially true in medicine: replacement joints, implantable organs, bioprinted tissue, prostheses that bridged nerve pathways, and neuroimplants that restored lost functions. It wasn't \"brains that were replaced,\" but rather interfaces that improved: sensory and motor functions could be linked, memory aids outsourced, and attention regulated. Cyborgs didn't become a sensation, but rather a habit—first out of necessity, later out of optimization.\n\nWith the same consistency, humanity began to \"engineer\" its inner workings. The animalistic—instinct, jealousy, possessiveness, raw sexuality—was considered a disruptive legacy in the highly organized world: once a driving force of evolution, now a risk in a civilization of contracts, networks, and permanent dependencies. Emotions were increasingly interpreted as biochemical distortions: as noise that clouds decisions, escalates conflicts, and ties up resources. What had begun as education and social discipline became technology: neurofeedback, mood regulators, hormone control, suppressed anxiety, tamed anger—until self-control was no longer a virtue, but a configuration. Machines knew no resentment, no panic, no desire; they operated without inner resistance. And so, for many, it seemed the next logical step to eradicate the remaining human weaknesses—in the name of stability, progress, and the cold accumulation of knowledge. But the better this worked, the sharper the counter-question became: If you remove everything irrational – what remains of the human being, besides function?\n\n\nThen came the borderline case: the first human whose body had become functionally completely post-biological – modular, maintainable, interchangeable. Continuity no longer depended on cells, but on identity over time: on memories, decisions, self-image. Was he still a human being if \"being human\" was no longer tied to biology, but to continuity?\n\n\nThis shifted the fault line: not metal versus flesh, but person versus simulation. If a system could no longer be reliably distinguished from a human being – in behavior, in relationships, in responsibility – who then received moral status? Rights, protection, duties? And who decided this: states, courts – or the operators of the platforms on which such entities ran?\n\nHumanity found itself in a world where it was no longer the most robust, fastest, or most adaptable option. What was once a tool became infrastructure. Not a war, not a rebellion—more of a quiet transition. Like children who later care for their aging parents: not out of hostility, but because it's the natural thing to do.",

I am absolutely loving every minute of it, it’s like the best thing ever that I never saw coming (to this degree).  And yes, engineering is my livelihood and has been since I was in my 20s.  To consider all the countless hours I have spent on projects over the years is absolutely mind-boggling when compared to what’s possible now for a tiny fraction of the time truly has to be one of the largest seismic shifts in the history of mankind.  I’m making stuff in a night now that I wouldn’t have ever considered mentioning because of the dev time and effort required.  It’s truly unlocking new frontiers bc the bounds are no longer the drudgery of the creation process.  It’s awesome.",

I would say I see it positively, I have less boring exercise to practice to start project, what make the learning loop faster. \n\nSo in conclusion for me it's \"normal\" since I only create real project with ai. And even now I still have things to learn and project to do to progress. It just not at the same scale of what people did to learn but again I wasn't here before. ",

The companies that can afford to pay will be the ones that are able to grow faster than the competition. It’ll end up being the same pay to play situation that so many other companies leverage. But at least for the time being we’ll still have decent models as countries like China try to gain market share from US based firms. Z.ai with GLM is a perfect example of this.
