Needless to say I now have it set up on WSL.\n\n(Previously I was trying the Windows version for the first time after hearing it was quite good using the Codex-VSCode extention.)",

AI doesn’t act “automagically” it executes within the permissions and environment it’s given. If destructive commands are possible, and something gets malformed (like that PowerShell + cmd /c escaping issue), the system will happily execute it. \n\n\nThat doesn’t mean tooling shouldn’t have better guardrails. It absolutely should. But agent + unrestricted permissions = production-level risk.\nStill, thanks for sharing it. Good reminder for everyone running agents with real access.",

I wanted to test drive some of this agent stuff.  \nHad a CLI tool I'd written and wanted to expand testing for it.  \nThe tool mass renames files in a structured way.  I already has a testing system that generated temporary file trees to run the existing tests on.\n\nWhere this goes is obvious.  But at some point, of course contrary to very explicit instructions, it decided \\*not\\* to use the testing utilities I'd made and instead just run the command on my computer -- wantonly renaming files (and potentially destroying them in the case of after-change name-collisions).\n\nFortunately I caught it very quickly and the nature of the tests and test regexes meant that nothing got damaged.  But it was a useful slap in the face.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nFor my part: I'm still \\*amazed\\* at how little emphasis there has been on sandboxing agents.  \nAgents seem to be most useful when they can run and loop for awhile.  But doing that without hard sandboxing is crazy ... but the norm. I'd expect people to be mentioning how docker/podman/apple-container isn't *enough* security, but instead that's well below most security standards.\n\nThat said: having spent a fair bit of time trying to get nice container setups and then get networking out of container and being able to ssh into container and connect it to IDE etc ... I mostly gave up.  (And gave up on agent coding altogether -- I only use them for examples and syntax or discussing technical questions like  design limitations of pipe buffers). There's just so much friction and time. And enough 'I *think* this works this way'. that it just doesn't feel worth it or safe.  (And, for me, I'd love to hav agents loop on UI stuff -- but now we need graphics working in our containers and ... well, it just didn't feel like a timesaving for me solo.)\n\nInterested to see if/when this changes.",

It’s far easier and lazier to reach for ad hominem and other logical fallacies than to come up with a real argument.\n\nMy post was obviously a joke, but there’s some truth to it. You see countless posts here about being stuck at the last 10% or struggling as projects grow. Those of use who have lived through delivering and supporting real world projects know that getting the code written is a small portion of the job, and by looking at the code that AI produces you can see that its architectural and technical decisions don’t tend to be very strong.\n\nSo you’d probably say something like oh well you should have just specced that all out, and it’s true that AI will do better then (assuming you follow a clear workflow, carefully manage context, and don’t give it too many steps at once), but the reality is that humans aren’t good at speccing out every details and many details (especially edge cases) are only uncovered later, and stakeholders give you ambiguous and vague requirements more often than not.\n\nIf you write a spec that is detailed enough and covers all the edge cases for an AI to do the job without issue, a human could have done it just as well with that spec, and while it might not be done faster, the code writing is the cheapest part of human software development.",

                  "text": "I’ve been in tech for 15+ years, and the reaction from some devs toward people building with AI is revealing. It’s fairly obvious that when you criticize someone for exploring a new way to build, you’re mostly just guarding the ability to create.\nI totally get the frustration. It must be incredibly jarring to spend years mastering complex syntax and struggling through the grind, only to see people bypass that initiation and build things in days. I can see why that feels like a devaluation of the craft. If I saw my specialized role being complemented or challenged by something getting exponentially better every day, I’d probably feel a bit defensive too.\nBut here’s the thing: AI isn't going anywhere. It’s understandable to want to protect the old ways, but the sooner we accept this is the new baseline, the less likely we are to be the ones left behind.\nAlso, a bit of an anecdotal observation: In my time in the industry, I’ve noticed a recurring theme where high level technical skill doesn't always overlap with user facing empathy or visual creativity. That’s usually why PMs exist, right?\nThe fact that creatives can now stumble through the code, messily for now, is clearly disruptive. It’s interesting to see the traditional gatekeepers of the tech stack lose a bit of that exclusive leverage. It’s a major shift in the power dynamic, and while it might be uncomfortable for some, it’s honestly fascinating to watch the prima donna era of dev culture evolve into something more accessible.\nChange is hard, but maybe it's time to embrace the vibe?",

It's working better than I expected, and it's running smoother and looks better than what I built on my own. The most obvious weaknesses I noticed was simply that it lacked understanding of stuff that was more obscure, like what a parameter in some tiny function in an obscure library did. \n\nAnd with the extra time I gained I was able to work on other \"more important\" stuff. \n\nI think what consumes most time now is reading through AI generated code, tweaking it according to what I feel is correct (even though maybe the AI is doing it the fastest or best way, I still want it my way lol), and correcting any bugs they might introduce.

As I use AI naturally because its awesome, I suppose that other ppl do the same, but apparently it is not that way.\n\nAnyway, the post I'm talking about was very detailed about this aspect.

I doubt an AI-generated app would put the correct safeguards in place to prevent users from spamming too many API requests as part of their daily use of the app.\n\nThere's also the issue of monetization of traffic/map data, which the Apple maps TOS seems to cover via licensing. Again, not something AI is usually aware of when generating apps, given how often AI-generated apps violate TOS/EULAs of APIs they're intended to interact with.\n\nLastly, if they intend to expand the app to other platforms, they'll have to pay more for Apple Maps API access, since the free quota is only available for iOS/macOS apps. At that point they'd need to rewrite it to use a different traffic API that is more cross-platform friendly in terms of TOS, to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience.",

So you actually learn how to code without the operational aspect.\n\nMost do not do that.\n\nThe notion offered here is that this is a good exercise, but putting in serious hopes of this being more than just another sw is very much blindly following a belief instead of following a professional assumption validation path.\n\nVibe is amplifying noise.

Code requires you to learn, to actively be distressed from having to learn. Vibe takes that barrier away. It is braindead letting someone else code.   \n  \nSo, what do you learn? You learn what you reflect upon. But you can only reflect upon things you actually can understand. If you simoultaneously also learn to code, then yes, this can be an iterative learning process. \n\nIf you just use tools based on hustling youtube videos - you learn terms and concepts you don't understnad.",

          "text": "r/webdev • Posted by u/SecurityAudit\nSite got a 50/100 on HTTP Observatory. Am I cooked? (Analysis of dropapp.app)\n\nHey everyone, just ran site dropapp.app through the Mozilla HTTP Observatory and... it’s not looking great. I’m sitting at a 50/100.\n\nI took a look at my raw headers, and it seems like I’m missing some \"defense-in-depth\" basics. I wanted to break down exactly how an attacker could actually pivot from these missing headers to stealing my database or API keys.\n\nIf you’re a beginner, take this as a cautionary tale on why headers aren't just \"extra credit.\"\n\n1. The \"Open Door\" Policy (Missing CSP)\nMy report shows zero Content Security Policy (CSP).\n * The Attack: This is the big one. If I have a single unsanitized input field, an attacker can perform a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.\n * The Breach: Without a CSP, the browser will happily run any script the attacker injects. They can script a \"scraper\" that runs in an admin's browser, finds the \"Settings\" page where my AWS or Stripe API keys are displayed, and sends them straight to their own server.\n\n2. Clickjacking (Missing X-Frame-Options)\nI noticed I don't have X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors.\n * The Attack: An attacker can load my site inside an invisible <iframe> on their malicious site.\n * The Breach: They can trick me (the admin) into clicking a button on their site that perfectly aligns with a \"Delete Database\" or \"Reset Admin Password\" button on my hidden site. It’s a classic UI redressing attack.\n\n3. Cookie Hijacking\nThe scan flagged that my session cookies likely aren't hardened (missing HttpOnly and Secure flags).\n * The Attack: If that XSS attack from step 1 works, the attacker can just run document.cookie.\n * The Breach: If my session ID is in there, they can just copy-paste it into their own browser and poof—they are logged in as me. Once they have admin access, the database is essentially theirs to download.\n\n4. Infrastructure Leaks\nMy headers are being a bit too chatty:\n * X-Served-By: cache-bfi-krnt7300081-BFI\n * Server-Timing: cfOrigin;dur=8\n * The Risk: This tells attackers exactly which edge nodes and origin behaviors I'm using. It’s like giving a burglar a blueprint of which windows in your house have the weakest locks.\n\nThe Game Plan to Fix It:\nI'm going to start by injecting these into my config:\n * Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): (Already there, but needs a long max-age).\n * Content-Security-Policy: Even a basic default-src 'self' would do wonders.\n * X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff: To stop MIME-sniffing exploits.\n * X-Frame-Options: DENY: No iframes allowed.\nHas anyone else dealt with a 50/100 score? What was the first \"critical\" header you fixed that actually stopped a real-world probe?\n\nTL;DR: My site is currently a playground for XSS and Session Hijacking because I’m missing basic security headers. Fixing them tonight before my API keys end up on a pastebin.",

Or just use google to ingest their existing data, but that introduces lots of issues and bottle necks IMO.\n\nMy concept was even likely easier in the data collection arena as my data was meant to be user submitted; essentially you go to a bar and you can report to others all the relevant info like how crowded, cover amount, type of music, etc..\n\nGood luck, I hope you overcome the hurdles I ran into!",

Super positive response talking to people tonight. I got 18 downloads by just talking to people. People coming up to the banners. Still, there are real challenges converting but not bad. The density chicken & egg problem is real. \n\nDrop is an incredible app. I hope you all try it out. The app continues to get more and more downloads. Running on so little sleep these past few days. Got to do it all again tomorrow and just keep going. Every week. Pivoting and learning. How can we get to the finish line to get one area of density so the value is immediately clear? \n\nYou learn as you go. I am learning how to convert in person and the different challenges. Thinking of the growth methods every hour and hacks. It’s all coming along. \n\nA conversation struck me tonight as I was out. A man from the UK had rolled by my sign and stopped. He said, “this is a fantastic idea. I came out tonight but everywhere it’s so busy. I would love to know which places aren’t busy right now.” We talked for a while. It was so interesting how this app could help someone like him. He had mentioned that he’s also autistic, and knowing how busy a place is beforehand would be incredible for him. He tried to download the app but it’s only on iOS 🤣🤣. \n\nSuccess isn’t guaranteed. This will be a monumental challenge. May God be with us. I want to ask people to not leave fake reviews because they’re angry about whatever they think Drop implies. It’s hurtful to leave a review lying about the app to try and kill it. The app works. It’s been tested through hundreds of hours of real world scenarios. I went through so much to make this. I have a real family. Leaving a fake review to hurt me does hurt me. It’s evil. You can download the app and see that the app works, that the geofencing works, that it’s impressively accurate in many situations (not everyone of them) and we could talk about that if the app makes it mainstream, but come on. You’re not just hurting me. \n\nRooting for me to fail is okay, fine, but actively playing a role in it happening is pure vitriol. \n\nLet’s keep winning! This is wartime stuff. Whether Drop succeeds or not, it won’t fail because I refused to fight until the end. \n\nHoorah!",

In addition, they are exposed to Angel’s Trumpet in order to chemically sedate and destabilize them. Targeting illicit substance users with preprogrammed microelectrodes in substances. The most disturbing element is that the perpetrators/ conspirators involved are highly educated scholars and electrophysiologists with advanced technical expertise. Claustrum Stimulation can “paralyze” the thought process - remote BCI: Interferes with cognition. It plays a role in coordinating attention and conscious integration across brain networks. Experimental stimulation has been shown to transiently disrupt awareness or responsiveness, in addition to be subjects to socopolamine (remotely-BCI). Angel’s Trumpet contains scopolamine, aka “zombie drug” or “Devil’s Breath.” At sufficient exposure levels, scopolamine can induce confusion, compliance, suggestibility, significant memory impairment, rendering individuals unable to resist or form lasting recollections of events. Vagus Nerve Excessive Stimulation: Involuntary Physical Disruption (Vocal Cord Paresis): Immediate Peripheral Control: provides peripheral control over the muscles and organs (vocal cords, diaphragm) actually producing the sound - remote BCI: Significant voice interruption. This extends beyond psychological influence. The victim is experimentally interfaced to another human/ connected to a brain computer interface system & drug-delivery system capable of delivering pharmaceuticals, exposed to Angel’s Trumpet in order to chemically sedate/destabilize. Stanford and Harvard are linked. They know the exact science to this. I’ve been subjected to BCI and dual-human neural interfacing without my consent and am being tortured. This is torture using Neuroscience and Neurotechnology. I’m trying to find exactly which institution is responsible so I can report them to the DOJ and FBI & so they can be held accountable. The excessive neurostimulation can only be done by an electrophysiologist. Same applies to interfacing two humans. Microfluidics might be the way that drug-delivery systems are used remotely. I don’t know the exact science to it. I just know that it’s happening to me.\n\nI don’t know how to find out which entity or institution is responsible. I’ve contacted the DOJ, FBI, CIA, FDA with minimal response. I have also sent request for notification of human research to all of the local hospitals, universities, and all of the major players in the global race to decode inner speech. That includes entities like NeuroLink, synchron, Blackrock technologies. Please help.\n",

          "text": "As someone who criticises AI and vibe-coding so often, this helped me realise how far a non-coder can go using today's AI tools, and I was surprised honestly. Add to that, I developed and published many games in the past (before AI became a thing), and I admit that I'm not able to achieve such a result using Godot (I'm more into Unity3D), because most Godot-made projects I saw so far are way lower quality compared to your game.\n\nNow let's come to my feedback, as a perfectionist, here is what I noticed :\n\n* The background music transition is not well done. When you move from a menu to another there is a sharp transition. +The music that's heard in the first menu is a bit loud.\n* I had to switch to a higher quality internet connection to be able to load the game, the loading somehow breaks when using a low/mid quality internet and the game gets stuck in the \"Loading\" screen with some errors that appear in the browser console (may be a problem from [itch.io](http://itch.io) itself and not your game).\n* I liked the visual effects of attacks/magic/enemies death. I'm wondering how did you achieve such nice looking effects using AI ? did it use some ready assets or generated them from scratch ?\n* The game lacks user-experience and I don't know how and where exactly, something just feels off and makes me not feel comfortable when playing. It can be due to the quantity of content and info that falls too fast from the beginning (many stats that I don't know what are they for, many weapons that I get but don't know whether I should use or sell them, as I can't properly compare them to the existing weapons, ...). The battle feels a bit fast too. Usually games get boring because they start getting repetitive early, it was not the case for your game, which had much more content than expected, but on the other hand this made me get tired because I started to miss many important info.\n* When the squad finishes an enemy wave and move together to the right, it feels like the background moves faster than their feet animations.\n* Performance was not optimal and this is normal for an AI-generated code.\n\nDid you at any point feel that when reviewing the AI-generated code, and asking for fixes or adding more features, that the changes it made caused some flaws at some parts that you already validated before ? My experience with AI so far was bad so I wonder how did you keep things arranged with such rich project ?\n\nAlso, do you have experience as an artist that helped you polish the graphics ? This game graphics are AI-generated but for once I didn't feel a big gap between the styles (usually AI-generated images are a mix of realistic, toony, 3D, ... styles)\n\nAnd one last question, how much $ did you pay overall for the AI usage making this game ?",

My experience with AI so far was bad so I wonder how did you keep things arranged with such rich project ?\n\nNot OP but I do a ton of \"vibe coding.\" I don't know when the last time you tried was, but the tools, especially Claude Code, have come a VERY long way in this regard, even just over the past 3 months. Especially so if you go through an extensive planning phase before beginning any major feature or the before you start on the project as a whole.\n\nI personally bounce the plan back and forth between claude (opus) and chatgpt/codex. Chatgpt kinda sucks at the initial plan but is FANTASTIC at poking holes in things and showing you all the ambiguities and unanswered questions about your existing plan. So make a plan with Claude, give the initial plan to chatgpt and ask for open questions, ambiguities, and to tell you anything it would change about the plan. Then you answer all the open questions and give that plus any additional feedback back to Claude, repeat 2 or 3 times depending on the size and scale of the project, and you end up with an iron-clad planning document that leaves very little room for the agents to improvise and start fucking stuff up.\n\nSo nail down the architecture and how every important function will work before you start, tell it the plan should be in manageable phases and then you tackle it phase-by-phase. Your main AI window will act as an orchestrator and the actual coding will be done with individual subagents who are told EXACTLY what to make and what the acceptance criteria are for each task. When possible, this will happen with parallel subagents working simultaneously on different aspects of the code, so the speed at which you can get this done is pretty insane. Then when each phase is done, you test and fine tune everything.\n\nAlso having it run a separate agent to perform a code review every time a coding agent is finished will catch breaking changes 90%+ of the time it still happens, and fix it before you even test and see it fail in action. This code review can happen automatically as a required part of the coding process if you save it as the development flow in your CLAUDE.md file which is basically like the rules for AI to follow when working on the project.",

I agree with you on the music and the combat feeling a little too fast to understand whats going on and there's a lot more work to be done to optimise the performance. I'll try to address your questions:  \n\\- For the VFX, I used some VFX spritesheets that I bought from [itch.io](http://itch.io) and also vibe coded some shader effects. the vibe coded shader effects are not great TBH, I think AI models don't make great shaders at the momeent.   \n\\- This may sound crazy, but I don't code so I don't review the code. I have to trust the model to make the best choices and do ocassional refactors to keep things sane, but I am pretty sure the code is messy.   \n\\- In the past 3-4 months, since Opus 4.5 came out, I am seeing very little regression in terms of the game as I add more gameplay features and content to the game. I think the models are getting better at understanding large codebases and not screwing things up when building new features.  \n\\- I am a Designer by profession and I do make art from time to time, so I am very familiar with tools like Photoshop and Figma, which helps a lot when I am cleaning up visuals and desinging UIs.  \n\\- I think this project costs about $1k+ in terms of tokens usage so far.",

You have to figure out how you’re going to hire people, what your product is, how to structure even a small company.  Generally, even 3 or 4 person companies require a lot of planning.   If you are raising money, the stakes go up because you need to attract investors, usually by providing some rational evidence of your chances of success.\n\nAnd still the majority fail.\n\nNow, a single person with absolutely no business skill, no past history of running companies… can vibecode an app in a week and put it on the App Store… all without doing marketing plans, having the funding to support it, market analysis, and a huge number of other things that ensure success.\n\nI think this will make those numbers go way up.  In the software arena, we may see 99% failure being the norm.\n\nYet, now and then there is a single person who really knows what they are doing… has good business sense, experience, understands the numbers… just could never figure out how to get a engineering team that could do it the way they wanted.   Vibecoding may make it possible for those few to succeed where they would not have been able to before.",

          "text": "It's ironic that the failure rate of vibecoders is much _higher_ than the statistics collected from traditional business trends in the US, even higher than modern startups. \n\nThis is partly because things which would normally have died on the vine as \"ideas\" are being built and published. \n\nAI tools have simply removed some of the friction to putting a software based idea into the world. \n\nUnfortunately, the AI tools have NO IDEA whether your idea is good. \n\nOnly real humans can tell you that. And the best way to ask them — before building anything at all — is to do messy IRL casual Customer Discovery style learning. \n\nBut many vibecoders are specifically trying to avoid that kind of real work. They'd rather spend their dollars on LLMs and their days vibing than spend a few hours testing their assumptions with humans. \n\nIf you want to create value for humans, start with the humans, and learn how to vet your own thoughts by doing r/CustomerDiscovery. This is the beginning of the Customer Development process and r/LeanStartup methodology. This is how we find r/ProductMarketFit. \n\nAnd the latest trend to focus on \"distribution\" is a bit silly as well. It feels like a new pet word for an old fundamental that the vibers have only just discovered. Everyone seems to be looking for another shortcut to it. Distribution is being sought through tricks and tips like engineering virality. \n\nInstead, the Customer Development method reveals an emergent sales and marketing process by taking us to the humans themselves, learning how they think, feel, talk, and behave around the problem/solution space we want to enter. You can literally reverse engineer your \"distribution\" by actually talking to your customers and learning how they already behave and buy. \n\nMost vibecoders appear to have no understanding about business fundamentals. Those haven't changed! If you're just repeatedly launching projects without doing any real discovery or validation work, you're just playing lottery.\n\nThe vibecoders who win in today's market will be those who use LLMs for what they're good at, but don't try to use them as shortcuts for a variety of things they simply cannot do. \n\nLLMs cannot do customer discovery for you. They'll pretend to, but they don't know what your customers will feel, think, or do. Same with marketing and sales  stuff. If you think they can, you're being fooled by a pattern matching algo. \n\nLLMs are trained on the past. We're building the future.",

This is something that folks constantly fail to understand, and one of the signs that they’ve never really done customer discovery.

Or perhaps a better way to say that is that r/productmarketfit includes all of these other things, or should. While learning from real humans, we should also be deriving our marketing messaging, channel placements, narrative patterns, key words and phrases, price points, anticipated objections, indirect competitor intel, and much more.\n\nWe can and should do all of that before building anything at all. But if you’ve already built something, it’s not too late to go back and do real customer discovery work to figure out the rest. And if in the process of doing discovery and validation experiments, you discover nobody wants the thing you built, the discovery work will reveal to you something else that you should be working on instead. \n\nIf you ever feel like you are guessing about any of your sales and marketing, content or process, let it be a big red flag that you are not meaningfully connected to the people for whom you seek to create value.",

Vibe coding operates similarly, just without the \"borrowing\" aspect. Even Elon Musk's first venture, Zip2, was reportedly a mess according to professional developers yet he sold it successfully. That's essentially vibe coding in spirit.\n\n\nThe reality is, agencies and individuals are already using this technology to accelerate development and generate revenue. Many more will follow.",

I've been using Cursor and then switched to fully cli agent in few months ago and have used to to help with more than just development, like brainstorming branding and content ideas for marketing.  \n  \nI don't have any paid users yet, but I had the agent (I actually made my own claude code competitor called sweet! cli) help me set up google search console and analytics and in the past months i've had about 50 visitors and 10+ signups from users who were interested in trying to product. \n\nI know at this point its just a numbers game and I can have the agent analyze its own growth data over time to create a ***feedback loop*** that legitimately drives new revenue growth.   \n  \nI mean, the AI model companies are using agents in a feedback loop of self improvement, why can't you use a model in a feedback loop with your app?

Dont let them confuse you, for me it seems like there are ways to get better outputs faster but I am still on a journey to improve the process, I am just now much more aware of what the level of quality I can expect and how to find ways to work with that, but just ignore the people who say they are building full products over the weekend with no coding skills, they are building something else and operating in a different way then what professional dev work looks like, just look at other companies and agencies in your domain of work, if they start getting 10x outputs and you are not, then its tome to worry about it, but comparing your experience and seeing what AI was able to do in your use case vs someone with zero prior experience and skills to judge the quality of the output is definitely a loosng game.

I exclusively use Cursor so here are a few things that got me out of the quagmire:\n\nUse rules - this was my first step. I had Cursor generate rules based on my feedback so I only had to correct it once. Rules are supposed to be applied automatically but I’ve found that explicitly @ rule will reinforce \n\nSegregate Duties into Agents - dedicate agents to specific tasks giving each agent greater context by pointing them at specific rules and docs. I have a dedicated UI/UX agent, a bug fix agent, a docs agent and a feature builder agent. This keeps the agent focused and has driven better results. \n\nUse Commands - to automate task such as /mystartofday, /mypush, /mysync, /mytest, /myrelease. You can highlight what to do and in what order giving you a better workflow and keep you disciplined. \n\nUse BugBot - for checking code and function feedback.  Again, make sure to create and maintain your bugbot rules to make it more effective. \n\nThe great thing about all these rules and docs is that Cursor can create and maintain them as you go, you just need to remind it every so often to “add that learning to the doc” and “what can we learn from this conversation that should be in our docs?”  \n\nI regularly run up to 5 parallel Cursor windows, each on its own branch using the specialist agents and do about 15 releases per day.\n\nEstablish the rules, but back it up with good docs and discipline. \n\nJust my two cents worth…",

I give it the URL to that file and I’ve already created that file with a comment at the beginning of the file saying put the roadmap here. \n\nMy last project I did that almost exact instructions set on the end yet and it worked quite well. I also had a large PDF, which I had used ChatGPT to come up with a PRD and a game plan of how best to implement what I want to do for this project and I gave it that URL also.

                  "text": "In standard English, **feedback** is an **uncountable noun** (also known as a mass noun). Here is why that correction is grammatically necessary:\n\n### 1. Uncountable Nouns\n\nUnlike countable nouns (like \"app\" or \"developer\"), uncountable nouns represent a concept or a mass that isn't typically counted individually.\n\n* **Correct:** \"I received much feedback.\"\n* **Incorrect:** \"I received many feedbacks.\"\n\nEven if you receive fifty different comments from fifty different people, it is still collectively referred to as \"feedback,\" not \"feedbacks.\"\n\n### 2. How to Count Feedback\n\nIf you need to refer to specific, individual instances of feedback, you have to use a **\"counter\"** or a different phrasing. Common ways to do this include:\n\n* \"698 **pieces of** feedback.\"\n* \"698 **responses** given.\"\n* \"698 **comments** provided.\"\n\n### 3. Comparison with Other Metrics\n\nLooking at the other cards in the image helps illustrate the difference:\n\n| Type | Term | Plural Form? | Example from Image |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Countable** | Devs | Yes | \"1101 Indie Devs\" |\n| **Countable** | Apps | Yes | \"203 Apps Uploaded\" |\n| **Uncountable** | Feedback | **No** | \"698 Feedback Given\" |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The letter \"s\" was crossed out because \"feedback\" is already plural in essence; adding an \"s\" is a grammatical redundancy that doesn't exist in standard English.\n",

Every user can see every other user's data. Nobody catches this in testing because you're the only user.\n\nPayments go through on the happy path. But failed payments, cancelled subscriptions, webhook failures? None of that is handled. Stripe sends an event, nobody's listening.\n\nThe database is flat. Everything stuffed into one table. Works with 10 test records. Falls apart at 500 real users.\n\nDuplicate logic everywhere. You asked the AI to add a feature, forgot you already asked last week, now two workflows fire on every action.\n\nNo error handling. When something breaks the user sees a white screen or nothing happens. No fallback, no message, no logging.\n\nVibe coding is great for getting to 80%. That last 20% is where the app actually becomes a product. If you're planning to charge real money, get someone technical to review before you launch.",

Who cares if you need to start from scratch after round 1 funding if you only sunk a couple hours into a project?\n\nI worked for a think tank that went into start ups to fix problems for them and I saw dozens of real codebases on startups, pre-AI. They all were made by coders who quit their jobs to work on it for six months, barely scraping by to get something out. Because of the massive time restraints, the codebases were shit nearly every time.  They spent the first year after funding basically refactoring everything to make it scalable.\n\nFor a programmer who knows the full stack moderately well, AI is a viable option for getting a quick release, getting bought out by a bigger entity or funded and then rebuilding everything more scalable once you can afford a couple employees who are experts in specific fields.\n\nIf you have no idea how to code it the first place, it's a lot more risky because you may end up with liabilities between release and funding that kill your business entirely.",

The terminal API fires events when data is written to the terminal surface, so you might be able to detect the prompt character rendering as a signal. Might be noisy but worth poking at.\n\nThe thing I'm most excited about is honestly the Desks as Directories concept. Right now multi-agent work feels kind of invisible — you don't really \"see\" the parallelism happening. Having a spatial metaphor for it could make it way more legible, especially when you're coordinating 4-5 agents at once.\n\nOne wild idea: what if the office had a \"bulletin board\" area that showed a live summary of what each agent last completed? Like a little async update wall. Could make for a fun ambient awareness thing without having to context-switch into each terminal.\n\nAnyway, PRing some CC0 furniture assets sounds like a fun weekend project — I'll check out the repo. This is a genuinely cool direction.",

The idea was to pull file references from our database and compare them with what exists in S3, then remove any redundant files.\n\nThere was some legacy behavior in the past, and as a result, we had hundreds of gigabytes of files that shouldn’t have existed in the first place. That issue had already been fixed, so I thought: great, let’s clean up the leftovers with a script.\n\nWhenever I write scripts like this, I always run a preview first. Only after the preview matches the expected changes do I run it again with --apply.\n\nThe script was basically finished.\n\nI then asked Codex, in the context of the cleanup script:\n\n“I have an idea. First, let’s run a dedupe to remove duplicate files with the same hash firstly. Then we’ll continue with the cleanup.”\n\nI was watching Codex work. Suddenly, I noticed something unexpected it created a new deduplication script and finished it very quickly. And do you know what it did next? It immediately ran the CLEANUP SCRIPT with --apply on my local test database but using LIVE S3 credentials. (Yes, my mistake I had them stored locally.) But seriously… what the hell.\n\nI killed the process as fast as I could, but it was too late. The S3 bucket went from 3 TB of user data to 34 KB.\n\nNow I have no idea how to explain this to my boss — or to the users. I guess I could just say that a bad endpoint was hacked and caused the data loss… but I know that’s not true....\n\n//EDIT: Fortunately, I had downloaded the entire S3 bucket three days earlier, and the database file references were not affected. So I asked Codex to write a script to restore the files to their correct locations in S3, since the downloaded files were not organized in the proper folder structure for some reason.\n\nI was in full panic mode, but thankfully the database was untouched and it also has backups. As long as I had the S3 files, I could reupload everything with significantly less damage than I initially feared\n\n//EDIT2: No I did not have S3 data on my PC but on other server which should do S3 backups but I did not finish it. I had other stuff to do.\n\n//EDIT3: My prompts\n\n[ https://hastebin.com/share/uwovusavit.csharp ](https://hastebin.com/share/uwovusavit.csharp)",

Unless we shift to a purely competitive economic model where everyone is making their own products (at which point why even buy software if your AI agents can make the same) then we’ll always need review.\n\nFirst, modern corporate models are built on bureaucracy and ownership at multiple levels. Executives love having someone to blame for failures and taking credit on successes. Agents directly to executives removes that layer and forces legal accountability on them. AI companies don’t want liability on AI, they want it on users.\n\nSecond, review ensures the final product is free of bugs and exploits. Again, this is necessary for both quality and final ownership for liabilities.\n\nLastly, if we do somehow shift to having AI do the full process then the only products are AI, hardware, and renting compute products for software development and creation. Why would I ever pay for software let alone a development and finance team? If AI does everything then I would just get an AI agent and not software.",

There are many paradigms, many ways to achieve objectives, each with very specific constraints depending on your target: customer facing, on a browser, on a cellphone, on a scanning device, in an elevator, on a smart watch...\n\nMy opinion is that LLMs replacing human devs is comparable to modern tools replacing craftsmen. They will impact the industry, and it will shift focus towards higher level thinking, but in the end you still need people that understand how to use the tools and what they do (what manual tasks they are making easier or replacing). Otherwise, you're relying on blind luck, hoping for the best.\n\nThe gist of it is that LLMs are, at their core, language models iterating on a growing context and deducting what the next plausible word (or more precisely token) should be in the output. As such, they are prone to giving very convincing answers (code) that do not necessarily do what you thought they would.\nThey might not handle the edge cases they should. They often \"forget\" crucial information, or are not scared to completely erase your hard drive because they do not understand what erasing a hard drive means: they just write words with a really high statistical significance, increasing the odds of making it useful to such a high level that actual intelligence emerges. Not intelligence in the sense of a human thinking, but intelligence in the sense of a system organizing, like millions of coin tosses will end up resulting close to a 50/50 chance, seemingly perfect. \n\nIn the case of LLMs, the probabilities have been calculated by ingesting content from the internet, answers which may be right as much as they may be wrong. Documentation is scarce, sometimes outdated. Source code evolves fast. People give wrong answers all the time. A very well formed and convincing answer can always be false: that's what we're used to deal with when talking to humans. This, however, is not usually the case when we are using tools. Tools should always give the same output for a given input. LLMs do not do that.\n\nUp until now, the proposed solution for convergence towards predictable outputs has been to increase the size of and encode context, and use even more energy to calculate outputs and iterate on them. Even this is not perfect, and ultimately LLMs need review and guidance.\n\nInvesting more energy might not be viable in the long term as LLMs become even more standard in the industry. They might become too costly to be mainstream due to these constraints. Even if LLMs  review each other, non-deterministic behaviour in their outputs can lead them to stray from their objectives and make it increasingly harder to understand what went wrong and when.\n\nReviewing output becomes increasingly difficult as you grow further away from the actual coding. People would lose skills and reflexes that are vital today to our coding ecosystems. For instance, a big part of our tooling depends on really clever people building (on top of) open source libraries. When these libraries become unreliable and the people maintaining them become unable to precisely estimate how, why, and when it can be fixed, the balance will be thrown off with potentially cascading consequences (as already happens from time to time from human error).\n\nUltimately, if you had all the time and resources in the world, maybe none of this would matter. But when people are held accountable for the success of their projects, when you have deadlines, when you have customers telling you that something you had working yesterday is not working today anymore and you need to answer something else than: \"my LLM did it, it's very sorry and now it's telling me it's probably due to something I don't understand so neither can you\", well, you need humans that know what is going on",

The code looks fine if you don't consider the context of the request. Tests might even pass, but it's not what we asked for.\n\nVet is a CLI tool that reviews git diffs using LLMs (either by calling them directly, through Claude Code, or Codex) to find issues that tests and linters miss. It checks for issues like logic errors, unhandled edge cases, silent failures, insecure code, and scope drift from your original request.\n\nVet can run as an agent skill for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex. When installed, your agent automatically discovers Vet and runs it after code changes.\n\nInstall the skill with one line:\n\n`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imbue-ai/vet/main/install-skill.sh | bash`\n\nWhat it's not:\n\nIt's not a linter. It's not a test runner. It uses LLMs to catch classes of issues that are invisible to static analysis like intent mismatches, misleading agent behavior, logic errors that are syntactically valid, and incomplete integrations with the existing codebase. It's meant to complement your existing tools, not replace them.\n\nDetails:\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/imbue-ai/vet](https://github.com/imbue-ai/vet)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/sBAVvHPUTE](https://discord.gg/sBAVvHPUTE)\n\nWe are excited to see how much you like using it!",

Are you chunking the git diff and doing some kind of cross-chunk reasoning, or is it more “best effort per chunk” with a summary at the end?\n\nThis depends on your definition of 'larger diffs' :). Vet does not do diff chunking. As such, it is not intended to run against diffs that are larger than the model context size. In the case of Opus 4.6 that is either 200k or 1M tokens which can be (very approximately) 13,000 to 65,000 lines of code (depending on tokens per LoC).\n\n  \n\\> Can it take in higher level context, like the original ticket / spec text, or is it mostly inferring intent from commit message + code changes right now?\n\nYou can add additional context to the model inputs! To achieve what you described, you could write the ticket / spec to files on the filesystem as part of CI, after your changes have been pushed to a PR, and pass both paths to Vet using the --extra-context option so it knows to consider the additional context in those files. This would work even if the files written resided outside of the repo. If they weer in the repo, Vet would simply consider them without having to specify them.\n\n  \n\\> Also curious about false positives. If I wire this into CI, how noisy does it get on a medium codebase, and is there a way to tune “paranoia level” per repo?\n\nWe tuned Vet to be very high precision by default, but it can be further improved by doing the following:\n\n\\- Setting the --context-threshold higher than the default of .8  \n\\- Disabling issue codes you aren't interested in it finding, like 'poor\\_naming'   \n\\- Adding additional information to your .vet/guides.toml file to inform the model you want it to be extremely precise.  \n\\-Using a model that is more precise, like gpt5.3, which seems to have been fine-tuned for high precision issue identification, based on our internal benchmark results.\n\n\\> Either way, using it as a post-step for agents feels spot on. The thing I really want is “never silently ship a partial implementation just because the agent got stuck,” and this seems pointed right at that.\n\nGlad to hear this resonates with you, would love to hear feedback once you've started using it!",
