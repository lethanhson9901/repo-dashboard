Simply nailing down the product requirements, writing (or reviewing) a technical design doc, requiring the agent to add and run tests with each commit, and reviewing PRs will make the agents' output a lot more sensible. Use them as very diligent, somewhat competent, but very forgetful junior engineers and you will not be disappointed.\n\nAlternatively, after you have requirements, you can write a ton of tests against the API layer, use those tests to programmatically identify dead backend code and remove it, then break out one chunk of endpoints at a time and re-write them in new modules.  Then you can write a new frontend, starting with a proper API client and then going screen-by-screen - you may be able to parallelize this somewhat with another developer, but expect to uncover inconsistencies in the API as you go.\n\nBut that's how I've gone about refactoring a project that was shipped to users, where you have to take care not to break anything at every step.  If nothing has shipped yet, you have the freedom of starting over and can get there faster.",

Also write tests first. It might help just splitting the big file up into independent endpoints first, without changing any logic.

Even if you give it some capabilities via MCP this minimal task I have where it fails still occurs as its not a good for for AI.\n\nA hybrid approach is probably better.

Before touching anything, add basic integration tests for the main flows. Use the app as a black box and test the API endpoints. This is your safety net.\n\n  \n2. Start extracting one route group at a time into separate files. Pick the simplest one first. Keep the original file as the router that imports from the new modules.\n\n  \n3. Use Claude Code or similar to help with the mechanical refactoring. Paste chunks of the 30K file and ask it to identify logical groupings and extract them. The AI can handle tedious extraction work pretty well.\n\n  \nFor the frontend UI/UX mess:\n\n  \n1. Create a simple style guide first, even just 5-6 rules: primary color, font stack, button styles, spacing scale. Apply these globally via CSS variables.\n\n  \n2. Pick one component pattern (cards, forms, whatever is most common) and make it consistent everywhere. Then move to the next pattern.\n\n  \n3. Do NOT try to redesign everything at once. Consistency beats perfection when cleaning up.\n\n  \nThe key is incremental improvement with tests protecting you. Your boss created technical debt but its not unfixable. Just chip away at it.",

Both are solid, but once you count lots of external users the numbers were not that different in the long run. In the end I stopped thinking in terms of “portal builder” and moved to a normal database plus an app builder on top.\n\nFor me that ended up being UIBakery on top of Postgres. I am not from their team or anything, it just fit better. External users only see their own rows, auth is handled once, and the pricing felt saner than paying per head for every customer who logs in twice a month. It took a bit more setup than Softr on day one, but I am much less stressed about the bill now.\n\nBig question is really your monthly budget and how technical you are willing to get. If you want to stay very low effort, Glide or Stacker might be easier. If you are ok touching a DB or getting some help, something like UI Bakery on top of Airtable or a proper DB can be a nice middle ground.",

Without that breathing room this turns into constant firefighting instead of real cleanup.\n\nThen I’d approach it in a structured, iterative way, in small steps:\n\n1. Stabilize the current state Make sure builds and runtime are reproducible and that it’s clear what currently works. Put very lightweight safeguards around the most important flows so you notice quickly if something breaks during refactoring.\n2. Make the structure visible Group the existing code into logically related functional areas and get a rough understanding of how they interact. At this stage it’s about creating clarity, not changing behavior.\n3. Modularize before optimizing Gradually move toward smaller, more clearly bounded modules without altering functionality. The goal here is readability and maneuverability, not “clean code” yet.\n4. Incremental simplification Once the structure holds, start reducing duplication, clarifying responsibilities, and making boundaries more explicit. It’s normal to go through multiple passes before things feel right.\n5. Bring UI/UX into a consistent shape No big redesign. Define a small set of layout and styling rules and apply them consistently over time. Consistency matters more than perfection here.\n\nAI can help a lot with the mechanical parts (splitting code, restructuring, repetitive changes), but it can’t make the judgment calls around boundaries, priorities, and acceptance criteria for you.\n\nThis only works if time is intentionally allocated for it. You’re being paid to do this and you’ll learn a lot about refactoring and system understanding, but without clear expectations and space, it quickly becomes your personal problem instead of a structural one.",

The system was built without anyone ever deciding what was in charge, what was allowed to change, and what absolutely shouldn’t. Once features start shipping faster than understanding, entropy wins every time.\n\nOn the UI/UX specifically, the trap is trying to “fix” it globally. If you touch everything at once, you’ll never finish. The only sane move is to pick one thin vertical slice that actually matters to users, define what “correct” looks like there, and enforce consistency only inside that boundary. Treat everything else as radioactive until proven otherwise.\n\nMore broadly, don’t try to refactor this into a good system straight away. First goal is to make it legible. Break the giant API file only if you can explain why each new boundary exists. If you can’t explain it, Cursor won’t be able to maintain it either.\n\nYou’re basically inheriting a product that worked by momentum, not structure. The fastest way out isn’t cleaning up the slop, it’s stopping the bleeding and forcing a single source of truth back into the system.\n\nIt’s rough work, but you’re asking the right question.",

A few things that helped me when dealing with similar situations:\n\nFor the immediate UI/UX stuff Pick one page/flow that matters most (the one shown in demos), establish a consistent design system with just a few components (buttons, cards, forms), then propagate outward. Don't try to fix everything at once — migrate page by page to a component-based approach. If you can get even Tailwind or a basic CSS framework in there, it'll do a lot of the heavy lifting.\n\nFor the 30k-line API file situation, firstly i can image thats a big mess, before you even touch refactoring, I'd honestly check for vulns first. Vibe-coded backends are notorious for missing auth checks, hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, and misconfigured database rules , especially if it was built fast with AI and never actually reviewed. You don't want to spend weeks refactoring and then discover the whole thing is leaking data.\n\nI actually built a free scanner called [Oculum](https://oculum.dev) specifically for this feel free to try it out\n\nGood luck tho the fact that you care enough to clean it up properly says a lot.",

He would full the pool with 50$. People would then join the pool test the app and provide a video of their feedbacks. The indie Dev could validate the review and then a chunk of the pool prize will be given to the test user. \nYou become a marketplace and you take commission on each transaction",

AND you only need to use them for the one-off cases.. not consistently, so it doesn't cost much in the end.\n\nAnd of course! Thanks for checking it out! ",

They either had a template ready, skipped error handling, or the \"app\" is a single screen with no real logic.\n\n  \nThat said, your approach of writing detailed specs first is actually the right one. The trick is to not write ALL the specs upfront. Break it into tiny slices: get one screen working end to end, then iterate. The AI is much better at extending something that works than building from a giant spec all at once.\n\n  \nAlso since you mentioned trying Codex first, give Claude Code a shot too. For mobile UI work specifically I have found it does a better job of maintaining design consistency across screens. The key is giving it one screen at a time rather than the whole app.\n\n  \nYour dev experience is actually an advantage here, not a disadvantage. You know what questions to ask and what corners not to cut. The people building in 2 hours are shipping stuff that breaks the moment a real user touches it.",

They have a localhost demo that crashes when you enter unexpected input.\n\nWhat I've found: the experienced developers who are thoughtful about requirements *up front* actually ship faster in the end because they don't hit the 'generated code house of cards' collapse at hour 6.

          "text": "Depends a lot on use case though. If you're making an app that just calculates something and doesn't have user accounts, you can absolutely use a powerful llm like Claude Code on Opus to rip out a mobile app in two hours. Once you start adding complex features, you start needing security layers and it starts taking planning the architecture, etc...\n\nMany also are selling the same product to multiple businesses, so they might have templates and resource documents for the llm that are pre-prepared, which can drop development time a ton.\n\nIt also takes learning the tools to get fast with them. Your software development background will be an asset in the long run, but you need to make some concessions when vibe coding. In vibe coding, it is often better to implement an automated testing system and use that to check off that something is working, rather than try to keep up with the speed it's generating code and reading through it all. It's kind of like when compilers came out for compiling higher languages into lower languages the first time. Programmers at the time were obsessed with going through what the compiler was putting out and complaining that it didn't allocate memory in just the way they intended. The reality though was that as computers increased in power and compilers improved, that became irrelevant. The software still worked and that was the end goal.",

So what I’m saying vibe code shaved 6-12 months of dev but when doing it the right way it still took 8-9 months to complete it and of course it’s ongoing so if you are a experienced developer then a real project will and still should take a good amount of time even if you worked it full time. Without vibing I’d probably just be getting ready to reach MVP after 8-9 months but with vibe coding I’m much further beyond mvp very huge project but no way I was going to do it in two hours for sure. If i did I’d be lying to say it’s secured or production ready in 2 hours… I think vibe coders have great ideas because they think as a end user as opposed to a dev just focused on quality code ya know but good idea no skill to implement is just a idea.

Any tips/heads up for native apps?",

The fact that you got App Store approval quickly and are already generating revenue shows you're onto something.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Some thoughts on scaling to that 1M goal:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Track what's working\\*\\* - Which marketing channels brought those first customers? Double down on what's converting.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Customer feedback loop\\*\\* - Those early users are gold. Talk to them, understand why they paid, what problem you solved. This will help you position for growth.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*ASO (App Store Optimization)\\*\\* - With some revenue, you can now invest in improving your app store listing, screenshots, description. This can significantly boost organic downloads.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Consider freemium or subscription\\*\\* - One-time purchases are great, but recurring revenue makes scaling more predictable.

But recently, we were tasked with a \"top-down\" AI-driven project. We had to use agents as much as humanly possible to build a substantial feature.\n\nI just finished a 14K Lines of Code implementation in C# .NET 8. After a few horrific failures, I’ve realized that the media’s version of \"everyone is a dev now\" is absolute BS.\n\n**The \"Vibe Coding\" Trap** The \"Vibe Coding\" trend suggests you can just prompt your way to a product. Sure, you can do that for a Todo app or a Tic-Tac-Toe game. But for a robust, internal tool with dozens interacting classes? **Vibing is a recipe for disaster.**\n\nThe second an AI agent is allowed to make an assumption—the second you stop guardrailing its architectural choices—it starts to break things. It introduces \"hallucinated\" patterns that don't match company standards, ignores edge cases, and builds a \"Frankenstein\" codebase that looks okay on the outside but is a nightmare of technical debt on the inside.\n\n**How I actually got it to work: The \"Architect-First\" Method** To get production-grade results, I couldn't just \"prompt.\" I had to act as a Principal Architect and a Drill Sergeant. My workflow looked like this:\n\n1. **The 2,000-Line Blueprint:** Before a single line of code was written, I used the AI to help me formalize a massive, detailed implementation plan. We’re talking specific design patterns (Flyweight, Scoped State), naming conventions, and exact technology stacks.\n2. **Modular TDD:** I broke the project into small, testable phases. We wrote the tests *first*. If the agent couldn't make the test pass, it meant my specification was too vague.\n3. **The \"DoD\" Gate:** I implemented a strict **Definition of Done (DoD)** for every sub-task. [E.gl](http://E.gl) If the AI didn't include industry-leading XML documentation (explaining the \"Why,\" not just the \"What\") or if it violated a SOLID principle, the task was rejected.\n\n**The Reality Check** AI is an incredible power tool, but it doesn't replace the need to know what you’re doing. In fact, **you have to be a better architect to use AI successfully at scale.** You have to define:\n\n* What coding principles to follow.\n* Which design patterns to implement.\n* How memory should be managed (e.g., using `Span<T>` or `Memory<T>` for performance).\n* How to prevent race conditions in concurrent loops.\n\nIf you don't know these things, you aren't \"coding,\" you're just generating future outages.\n\nAI doesn't make \"everyone a dev.\" It makes the Senior Developer an Orchestrator. If you don't put in the hours for planning, specification, and rigid guardrailing, the AI will just help you build a bigger mess, faster.",

Anyone else have any thoughts on that?\n\nEdit: for context, I have been using Windsurf for 14 months, and Claude Code on the side for 4 or so.\n\nSince Opus 4.5, I still review commits, but with a decent set of prompts/requirements, I can one shot some mid-level complexity.

You are proving my point exactly. In the right hands, AI agents are incredible tools—they can even build something as complex as a Linux kernel. However, I am certain those agents were provided with thousands of lines of context in markdown files, detailing exactly what needed to be done. Those files were created by highly experienced developers. If you gave 16 Opus 4.6 agents to someone who doesn't understand how a kernel functions or what to look out for, it would be a disaster. Even as a developer, I couldn't write a Linux kernel without extensive research. If I deployed 100 agents today, the result would still be unusable because I wouldn't be able to provide the architectural blueprints necessary for a successful outcome.",

Yes, you need to have a good understanding of software enginnering principles to make it work for less-than-trivial apps. **For now**.\n\nBut as the capabilities of models are still evolving, probably this won't last for long either. \n\nThe thing is that the software development process consists of several layers of understanding/knowledge and thus activities that are sometimes done by different people (in large projects) with different skills (though these people may have worked in other roles earlier). At one end, we have the users/stakeholders who don't (necessarily) know much about the whole process and can't formulate the requirements, but have an understanding of what they want (not necessarily what they need). At the other end is the completed, working software.\n\nNow AI seems to be able to do more and more of this process, starting from the bottom, i.e. from the side of the code. At first it was \"just glorified autocomplete\", and it gradually was able to create more and more on its own meaning it can work with (understand, if you will) higher level, more abstract concepts that are more removed/farther away from the code that **it** needs to create in the end. \n\nFor now, you'll want an architect/senior engineer/tech lead to drive it (or, at least to lead the project) for best results. Maybe we can start calling it something else, just like we dropped the \"prompt engineering\" term, but it doesn't matter. It's really AI-assisted software creation where AI does more and more of the task. At one point (we don't know when) it will be able to just talk to the users, extract the requirements from them by asking questions, explaining tradeoffs (though there will be less reason for tradeoffs probably), etc.\n\nThough as we'll approach this level, we'll probably need less software, less software of the kind that we have been creating in the past because people will have to do less with computers anyway. (E.g. we'll probably need less complex accounting software as we'll need less accountants doing less low-level tasks related to accounting and rely more on AI.)",

It's impressive, but as a skeptical engineer, I wanted to check the code quality under the hood.\nI picked 5 random open-source repositories from GitHub that were clearly AI-generated (tagged \"built with Lovable\" or \"Cursor-generated\").\nThe Result: 5/5 failed a basic security audit.\nThe \"Silent Killer\" Bug:\nThe most common issue wasn't a complex hack. It was a simple configuration error that AI models make constantly because they prioritize \"making it work\" over \"locking it down.\"\nSpecifically, I found Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies that looked like this:\n\n\n-- The \"I'll fix it later\" policy\nCREATE POLICY \"Enable read access for all users\"\nON \"public\".\"users\"\nFOR SELECT\nUSING (true);\n\nWhat this means:\nThe AI wrote this so the frontend wouldn't throw permission errors during the demo. But in production, this line means anyone (even unauthenticated visitors) can run a SELECT * on your User table and dump emails, hashed passwords, and profile data. I was able to pull the entire customer list from one of these \"launched\" startups in about 3 seconds.\n\nThe Problem:\nAI is great at writing code that functions. It is terrible at writing code that is secure. It doesn't know context. It just wants to clear the error message.\n\nThe Offer:\nI'm tweaking my internal audit checklist for this. If you built your MVP with AI (Cursor/v0/Lovable) and want a sanity check:\n\nDrop your GitHub repo link (or DM me).\n\nI'll run a quick audit on your schema.sql, API routes, and Client components to see if you're leaking data. No charge, just testing my own detection rules against real-world mess.\n\n\nEdit: Please only send public repos or specific snippets if you're worried about privacy.\n\nEDIT: The queue for free audits is now open at vibescan dot site. I'm processing these in batches today.",

I think having a file which contains the checklist and ask the coding agent to do periodic review and report, and log the audit result + actions taken would go a long way. Codex at least is capable of finding and fixing problems, but you have to prompt it. My guess is the training data contains a lot of badly made code base (if they used public repos to train, then I understand), so it doesn't default to good practices.\n\nCodex at least likes to: add dependencies without notifying, inline/runtime schema changes, add variables and flags without notifying, and skip certain part of instructions if it think it is too complex (it will choose the shortcut regardless of whether wise to do so). Lastly, and this is the killer, it doesn't like to verify the code when asked about existing functions and likes to guess what the code \"would\" do. So if you are in tune with the nuances in Codex's responses, you might think your code has security features where it does not. I run into this a lot, so I have to ask it to point to the code for mission critical assessments. But if you are a true viber and can't read the code it does. you no good, and you have to rely on agent's assessment which is very unreliable.",

I don't have my MVP built yet, but if you are offering, would you mind if I send the public repository your way once I have the MVP put together?\n\nI've been using google AI Studio to write code for me and then having Gemini explain how to put everything together in VS Code. I am creating an accessibility tool for neurodivergent and/or disabled people and so security is a HUGE concern for me because the program will be dealing with user medical data. I just started putting it together, even though I've been planning it since last May.\n\nI'm also learning python slowly along the way, so I have an understanding of the code and can eventually go through and edit things myself. I figured before I released a beta test I would hire a part time developer or two to specifically help with ensuring end to end encryption on all user data.\n\nIf you wouldn't mind looking over it once it's complete, I would be extremely grateful. I will have to work on marketing and getting a kickstarter before I could afford to pay for a dev, but that's a future concern. I would appreciate your help if you're willing though! 😊",

I’m just a middle aged dude that started building now, AI makes superhumas out of people (people that really know hot to leverage it). People call it vibecoding but I think that word is fucking stupid. \n\nAnyways, for brief context: I’m building a mini-webapp (it’s called Picturific) that automatically generates multiple images with zero prompts, while keeping character and style continuity. \n\nThis is how it went down.\n\nI went to Austin for a music show (the band’s name is Orchid, if anyone cares) for 3 days. I did not take my laptop and I did not check emails. I only checked emails when arrived, and I started seeing receipts from FAL. At first I saw 2, which I thought and knew was a lot. But I did not think much of it. I continued working. Then I came back to check the emails again. I scrolled more. And a shitload of these FAL emails started appearing.\n\nIn less than 72 hours, my project had burned through $700+. Fuck.\n\nI had no idea how this happened.\n\nI spent the next 6 hours pissed, digging through logs, with the help of the same AI that had messed up the code. But I had no choice, I don’t know how to code. I had to work with the AI knowing it was capable of fucking up again. \n\nIt turns out I (or rather the AI) had built what the AI called a \"Ghost Machine.\" If you're building with AI agents and cloud functions, you might want to read this.\n\nOne of the core values of my app Picturific is consistency. To keep our characters looking the same across x scenes, I built an \"AI Auditor\" (The AI called it the Eye of Sauron). After every image is generated, the auditor checks it against a character reference sheet. If the hair is slightly wrong or a character is missing a medal (for example), it rejects the image and triggers a retry.\n\nThe Hallucination Cascade\n\nI asked the AI to plan the scenes based on a long story. I asked for 3 images. But the AI got \"excited\" or something and returned a plan for 22 scenes instead. Since I didn't have a hard cap on the logic yet, my code started 22 separate tasks.\n\nThe \"Zombie Worker\" Loop. \n\nThis was the real fuck up. Some of these complex generations were taking 2 minutes. My cloud provider (Supabase) has a \"self-healing\" feature. If a task takes too long, the cloud thinks it crashed and automatically restarts it.\n\nBecause I hadn't built \"Checkpointing\" (the code didn't check if it was already on its 3rd attempt after a restart), the newly born worker would start the cycle all over again.\n\nThe result of this was that one single user click triggered an infinite loop of AI agents fighting each other over shit like \"incorrect hair shading,\" with the cloud platform constantly reviving the dead processes to keep the war going. At $0.15 a generation, the bill moved fast.\n\nThe Three (very fucking expensive) Lessons (that hopefully will save you some trouble):\n\n1. AI doesn’t understand your budget. You can't trust an LLM to follow a \"Number of Images\" constraint if the input text is long. It can hallucinate scope. You must hard-code limits into your backend. If you don't have a \"Circuit Breaker\" in your code, you’re just handing your credit card to a toddler who likes to click buttons.\n2. The Cloud is a Multiplier. \"Self-healing\" cloud functions are great for uptime, but they are a nightmare for \"Leaky\" AI logic. If your code can trigger a restart without checking its own history, a small bug becomes a massive financial leak.\n3. Visibility is your only defense. If I hadn't been logging every single \"Audit Failure\" and \"Task Start\" in a forensic database, I would have had no way to explain the $700. I would have just seen a high bill and probably quit the project. Detailed logs are the only reason I was able to find exactly why what happened happened, and how to fix it without probably having to restart the whole thing (this is probablue due to me not being a developer and not being able to read code).\n\nFor now, I have plugged the leaks. I limited the AI scope, fixed the restart loops, and taught the \"Auditor\" that perfection isn't worth bankruptcy, or something like that.\n\nThe silver linings is that the \"forced\" retries actually worked—the consistency is better than ever because the AI eventually \"learned\" what I wanted.\n\nIt’s been an expensive lesson, but the output is finally something I’m proud of.\n\nWhat's your worst AI fuck-up story?",

The zombie worker loop combined with auditor retries is a nasty combo.\n\n  \nA few things that saved me after learning the hard way:\n\n  \n1. Hard spending caps on every API key - most providers let you set this. Set it lower than you think you need. You can always raise it but you cant get the money back\n\n  \n2. Circuit breakers with exponential backoff - after X failures in Y minutes, stop entirely and alert yourself. Dont let the system keep trying forever\n\n  \n3. Idempotency keys - so if a task restarts it can check if it already completed successfully instead of starting fresh\n\n  \n4. Separate dev keys with tiny limits - never use production API keys during development, its too easy to accidentally run a loop\n\n  \n5. Per-request cost tracking - log estimated cost per API call so you can see it accumulating in real time\n\n  \nThe self-healing cloud function thing is brutal. Vercel, Supabase, AWS Lambda - they all restart on timeout by default. You have to explicitly build in checkpointing to survive restarts gracefully.\n\n  \nThe silver lining is youll never make this mistake again. And the quality improvement from forced retries is real - I had a similar experience where the retries actually improved output quality because the AI learned from previous attempts.\n\n  \nWhat provider are you using for the image generation? Some have built in rate limiting and spending controls that help catch this earlier.",

          "text": "There are a few things here that Caused your issues. 1. Combination of prompts used and LLM to write the code and no project planning to keep the AI in check. 2. Poor project planning, I say this because while you think you reviewed the project documents you didn't review them with a panel of experts. Some of this can be automated. \n\nUltimately, better source documents means better end product. Here is an example:\n\nYou tell AI to write an application and when it comes back it's missing 24 API endpoints and 35% of the database structure, UI/UX logic, etc. \n\nWhen you properly plan this process out the AI will build out everything and keep a map to everything as well. \n\nPersonally I went backwards in time on my practices with software development using AI. I actually stumbled into the idea that if you plan everything and I really do mean every detail you can get a working finished product using some of the most complex coding languages today. \n\nI do charge for assistance on project refactoring, etc. and I'm already pretty booked up. For the right price though my schedule just opened up.\n\nI primarily focus on Secure SaaS solutions and have built several sites which the longest project was quoted to taking 2 to 3 years by a team of 6 which I had it planned and coded in less than a month. I spent the next 2 months source reviewing and verifying the logic before sending it off to the client and they were very excited. :-)\n\nThis work was under a strict NDA so I can't show off the finished work sadly.  That site was a really cool idea and they even provided me patents they already had in a pending state and asked me to see if their ideas would work and if they didn't to find an alternative way. (Yes, AI can also do that as well.)\n\nI include a final code scan to validate if it detected any patent infringement. It's not perfect of course but one thing to remember; all main steam AI models contain patents as a source. AI is able to tell you if it used a patent during development.",

A few passes of that until the plan is solid with details on all the stages of implementation. \n\nThis gives me much better results than when I used to jump straight into directly asking an agent to go something with code.\n\nThen once it's done, I'll do a few agentic audit and optimisation passes, in some cases even refactors to ensure that the codebase is neat and tidy.\n\nWorks very well for me.",

Meta prompting is getting increasingly harder to get these documents however there are ways to hydrate them out of the aether so to speak.\n\nNext time you are doing that try it on the Deep Research modes on your planning. Do that on several information domains of what you are doing. Then take that and analyze your project. You will be surprised. :-)\n\nAnd yes I agree, this process doesn't really fit vibe coding  and needs a coined name for it.\n\nWhich this process when you plug some fancy MCP servers or leverage advanced prompts that keep track of where they are and what they are doing... You basically fixed the \"vibes\".\n\nAI Prompt Project Planning (APPP) Orchestrated Agentic Development (OAD) Augmented Engineering Development (AED)\n\nLastly if you add in domains like Legal, Marketing, Cyber Security, etc  you just hardened your project.\n\nLastly here is an idea that is a knock from Minecraft:\n\nS-Cubed (Scute Secure Shell) is a hardened development philosophy that fuses the rapidity of \"vibe coding\" with the rigid invulnerability of Clean Architecture. Drawing on the Minecraft mechanic where gathering scutes creates a helmet that allows for underwater respiration, S-Cubed treats software components as individual, armored plates (\"Scutes\") that lock together to form an impenetrable \"Secure Shell\" around the application's core logic. This protective layer filters out technical debt and external chaos, allowing the developer to safely \"vibe\" on the business logic inside without drowning in infrastructure concerns. It serves as both a quality gate and a cultural shibboleth: if your code hasn’t been architecturally fortified to the point of being \"turtley enough for the turtle club,\" it doesn't get deployed. Image Generation Prompt\n\n>Prompt: A close-up cinematic shot of a futuristic turtle shell helmet resting on a sleek black server rack. The helmet is constructed from glowing green hexagonal scutes. Etched into the side of the helmet in neon blue is \"S³\". The lighting is moody and atmospheric, reminiscent of a hacker's den. Photorealistic, 8k.\n\nWhich now you can say I'm S-Cubed my vibing... Or SSS vibes or Scutin my project to vibe.\n\nS-Cubed Vibe Coding",

So it would allow you to run dev tools, edit the source code, recompile, reboot with the new kernel, and have everything still work.\n\nHonestly, I didn't think it would happen. Best case, I thought I'd end up with something that could run a couple of kernel-space processes taking turns printing to UART. And then it happened… The self-hosting milestone is completed.\n\nSlopix has:  \n\\- A simple shell  \n\\- A C compiler (and other build essentials)  \n\\- An interactive text editor with C syntax highlighting\n\nIn principle, nothing stops you from developing Slopix inside Slopix now.\n\nIt took 5 weekend sprints. Roughly 45k lines of C. I learned a ton about operating systems and a lot about coding agent workflows. Had a lot of fun!\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/davidklassen/slopix](https://github.com/davidklassen/slopix)",

Once you ship it the reality is different, \"does it work\" is no longer the only thing that counts.\n\nWhen users are spending money, \"can we maintain this\" is absolutely a valid risk question.

Then looking at code is boring and will slow you down.\n\nAre you learning to code? Yes, understanding matters a lot.\n\nIs this a prototype? Understanding the code matters less, and verification matters more.\n\nAre you running it in production, and building a business around it? Then being primarily dependent on AI is a liability.\n\nTherefore the bar isn’t whether you wrote it by hand, the bar is do you have enough understanding/ownership to maintain it under pressure?",

More importantly, it’s stable and still growing month over month.\n\nWhat surprised me most is that none of this came from TikTok hype, Instagram reels, or viral launches. No big audience. No “growth hacks.” Just a boring combination of shipping consistently, fixing UX friction, listening to user complaints, and iterating for months.\n\nPeople keep saying the app market is dead, SaaS is saturated, hardware is impossible, etc. From what I’m seeing, that’s mostly noise. Revenue still compounds if you keep improving something real. Whether you’re building a mobile app, a SaaS, or even a physical product: if users are getting value and you keep showing up, the curve eventually bends upward. It’s not glamorous, but it works.\n\nI’m still iterating on my app daily, and I expect it to keep growing and not because of hype, but because people actually use it.\n\n**If you’re in a slump right now: don’t stop. This is probably the best time in history to keep building.**",

Because you actually own the economics and the relationship with users.\n\n  \nThe thing people miss about \"the app market is dead\" takes is that they are comparing to 2012 when you could ship a flashlight app and make money. The bar for quality went up, but the tools to hit that bar went way down. So if you can actually iterate on real feedback (which most people quit before doing), the compounding is real.\n\n  \nCurious what your retention looks like after 30 days. Habit trackers live and die by that number and the ones that survive usually found one specific UX pattern that keeps people coming back. Did you find yours or still experimenting?",
