Just read the damn output and ask about it, the concepts, the documentation, ask about the documentation, and so on.\n\nAre people allergic to learning new things? If you spend so much time understanding how to prompt an AI (even though vibe coders don't seem to do that either), why not also learn the contents of the output?\n\nAnd I say that as somebody who hated to code.

Your encrypted conversations actually look like poetry or language learning content instead of obvious ciphertext.\n\nFamily thought I was antisocial. Worth it.\n\nWhat did everyone else build?",

I worked in a think-tank that was brought in to startups to implement or fix something for years, so I got to see the actual live codebase of at least fifty startups.\n\nTypically two scenarios in a startup:\n\nWithout vibe coding. You take time off work or work overtime for months to get a minimum viable product for investors. You're either operating on a super tight budget because you're not working or you're strapped for time because you're working at 10PM after working all day. This prioritizes cutting corners and the resulting code has a shitload of tech debt. When you finally get funding, you've invested hundreds of hours into the codebase, so you typically make it work and just have to live with the problems.\n\nWith vibe coding. You rip out an MVP in a few weeks easily. Vibe coding is excellent at getting a quick idea materialized fast, it struggles later when the project is very complex. This puts you into the funding stage really fast and you can usually be doing this while you're also employed, so you can take your time and often get a better investment deal. When you finally get funding, you can basically discard your original MVP and use it to plan the full project. This makes the full project have way less tech debt because the vibe coded MVP is kind of a \"draft\".",

I've had AI projects set up, ready, and in a prototype phase in 2 hours when it used to take 2weeks. No. The 2 hour output is not equivalent to 2 weeks, but 3-5 days? Yes. Scope would be for a fulltime dev to generate that. In those situations, its feasible paying $20 in credits vs $500-900.\n\nIts not a X vs Y though. It never was. But while \"i won't touch AI code with a 6 foot stick\", someone else is, while understanding how to prompt better and/or use it only for simple functions. You can stay sleeping an extra hour if you want, meanwhile someone else will eat your lunch.\n\nIf you think \"its just a bubble\" or that it won't reach a point you'd need \"3 engineers on a project\" instead of 5, then tell me again how you're pissed off because you were one of the fossils cut.",

But this is not really about code review these are things a vibecoder needs to check manually and learn (wow!) on his own.\n\nIf I hire a senior developer, I still won’t know whether the code is secure for me. Maybe he’s an AI hater and wants my project to fail or be hacked in the future. At least with AI, there are levels, rankings, and reputations and I prefer it. Although I like the idea of Replit to add a  human coder \"marketplace\" inside their product. This is really good idea, but I personally don't use their AI framework. \nAlso, a professional construction engineer won’t always find every issue either. If we want to raise the level of checks, we can ask a third or a fourth AI. And comparing AI to a “retarded engineer” is not correct, top AIs are already at the level of a mid-level engineer.",

I understand the difference between a development environment and a production environment. So I see merits in both sides of the argument. It is fun to build something that wouldn't have been possible before AI. Like wanting to make a song, but not having any musical talent. You can hear the song in your head, but you can't reproduce it in the real world. AI let's all that happen. It can be intoxicating.\n\nHowever, I can also see the concern for a flood of garbage on the market. If every app in the app stores were vibe coded by someone with zero knowledge, then the risk of leaks and hacks would increase exponentially.\n\nSo, the problem isn't AI or making things with its help. It's just a tool, like a hammer. It'll do what you tell it to do. The problem is people thinking that they don't need to know jack shit to put something into production. That's not going to go well, in any scenario. \n\nThe solution is to work in a development environment and actually learn while building. It's called due diligence and it's encouraged in any industry. I don't think the argument is that you need to be a senior developer to build an app. Rather, you need to build an app like a senior developer, if that makes sense.\n\nFor example, I started a project to see if I could build a .NET app that would integrate with GitHub and act as a PowerShell script repository, with dynamic updates and what not. Now, I know very little about writing C# code. However, being in IT, I know I needed unit tests and a CI/CD pipeline. I also know I needed authentication of some type, 2FA, and role based access. Not only to protect the repository, but also, I have some PowerShell scripts that will bring an entire network to its knees if not used by someone with the proper knowledge. Anyhoo, my point being, I had to have knowledge of all of that, understand what it means, and know how to tell AI how to do it. That brings me to my next point: The codebase got so complex that Claude Sonnet could no longer handle it. I think I'll have to continue with Claude Opus, at this point, which I don't have access to, ATM. But, I wouldn't know that Claude was struggling if I wasn't paying attention to what it was doing and outputting.\n\nAnyway, I think that's the criticism that the developers are offering; some more curmudgeonly than others, but mostly the same point. It's not that vibe coding is bad. You just need to know what you're doing still, before entering the production environment, especially if you care at all about your customers/users.",

Congrats on shipping and getting that first customer.\n\nI'm also building with Claude + Cursor (49, zero coding background before March 2024, now have 2 apps live with paying customers). So I get the excitement of \"holy shit, this actually works.\"\n\nBut I also want to address the concern in the comments, because it's valid:\n\nVibe coding is incredible for getting things built. But when real money and user data are involved, there's a responsibility layer that AI tools don't automatically handle.\n\nWhat I've learned shipping AI-built products:\n\nTest the hell out of payment flows. I use Stripe, and I spent days testing every edge case. Failed payments, refunds, subscription cancellations, webhook failures. AI writes the initial code, but I test like my reputation depends on it (because it does).\n\nSecurity isn't optional. Even if you don't understand the code, you need to understand what the code is doing with user data. Read through the authentication logic. Understand where data is stored. Use established services (Supabase, Stripe, Auth0) that handle the hard security stuff.\n\n\"Codebase is probably a mess\" is fine for MVP, but... once you have paying customers, you need to either learn enough to maintain it safely OR hire someone to audit the critical paths (auth, payments, data handling).\n\nThe \"fix this error pls\" approach works until it doesn't. For features, it's great. For security and payment handling, you need to actually understand what's happening, not just that \"it works.\"\n\nHere's my personal rule:\n\n\\- Vibe coding for: Features, UI, business logic, integrations, 90% of the app\n\n\\- Extra careful with: Authentication, payments, user data, anything that could harm someone if it breaks\n\nThis isn't anti-vibe-coding. I've built everything with AI tools. But I also know I'm responsible for what ships.\n\nYour app working and getting customers is awesome. Just make sure you're also:\n\n✅ Using Stripe or similar (not handling card data yourself)\n\n✅ Have proper error handling on payment flows\n\n✅ Following App Store guidelines on subscriptions\n\n✅ Can respond if something breaks at 2 AM\n\nThe community celebrating vibe coding wins is great. But we also need to be honest about the responsibility that comes with real users and real money.\n\nCongrats on the first customer. Now the real work begins: keeping them happy and safe.\n\nWhat are you using for payments and backend? Happy to share what's worked for me if helpful.",

That does not equate to what a very experienced engineer could create. Thats like saying I can buy campbells soup, heat it and put it in a bowl and telling a Michelin chef that I also made soup and bark at him that it took me less than 2 minutes. The Michelin chef will surely think I’m an idiot. \n\nAs far as llm’s go and their training data. The best code and algorithm implementations are IP and not in the public domain. Google would never train their models to learn their IP and best codebase. Thats also why it is hard for llms to produce the results a seasoned engineer would like- they were not trained on it. You can try and push into a very specific direction but will end up discarding and refactoring. \n\nSo hard no to what you have said. Sorry.",

We are now able to dig holes faster than ever, so do you think demand for holes will increase? Software products are all over the place and most are simply pointless. We can now do more of the pointless and none of the people who are knee deep into this can do more than the others. It is an open field. What one knows the others can too. It’s still the same thing but with yet another abstraction. It is a form of increased democratization but it will only lead to more crap done faster, not ultra quality done instantly by one person that replaces dozens. We are still the same dumb egotistical asshats. Just use the thing, get your work done. It’s anyway going to be sent to the bin. But much faster now. This is a form of mass hysteria. Things will change but not seismically. Just go at a butcher shop or the mayor‘a office and tell me if you see the panic of magic automation.",

      "text": "i just opened a repo from a founder who hit 1k paying users last month. the app feels snappy, customers love it, but the backend is one deploy away from a meltdown. i see this story every week.\n\nhere is what usually hides behind \"it works for now\" and how to spot it before an investor demo or a traffic spike makes it explode.\n\n1. the database grew teethtables that started clean now have six boolean flags called is\\_done, is\\_finished, is\\_complete. same idea, different names. queries run full table scans because no one added indexes since day 3. if pg\\_stat\\_statements shows the same select running 800 ms you are already in the danger zone.\n2. env files hold secrets that should never see gitstripe keys, openai tokens, jwt secrets all sitting in .env.example ready to be copied to the next intern laptop. rotate them once, set up doppler or vault, sleep better.\n3. background jobs share the same server as web trafficone user uploads a 50 mb csv and the whole sign-up flow slows to a crawl. move uploads to a queue, let workers handle heavy lifts, keep web threads free for paying clicks.\n4. you have no idea which API call costs the mostmap every external call to a user action. log duration + cents. when an investor asks \"what happens at 10x users\" you can answer with real numbers instead of hope.\n5. tests exist but they never run on prod dataseed scripts are cute until real users create edge cases ai never imagined. schedule a daily job that clones a tiny anon subset of prod and runs the suite against it. catches the weird null birthday bug before it hits twitter.\n6. deploys are still manual and scaryif you ssh and pull main you will eventually forget an env var or migration. github actions + blue-green deploy takes one saturday and removes that 2 am panic forever.\n7. one big repo holds user app, admin dash, landing page, and blogsplit them the moment marketing wants a new pixel. separate deploy pipelines stop the blog css break from taking down user logins.\n8. no circuit breakers around third partieswhen sendgrid hiccups your sign-up flow should not 500. wrap external calls with a tiny retry + fallback. users get a polite toast instead of a white screen.\n9. logs are noise, not signalprinting \"here\" in every catch block is not observability. add one request-id header that follows the call through every service. when a payment fails you can trace it in ten seconds, not ten greps.\n10. you measure uptime but not latency\n\na 200 response that takes 4 seconds still kills conversion. set a simple sla: 95th percentile under 600 ms. alert when it drifts. small fixes like eager loading or a missing index usually win you +8 % activation.\n\n11. feature flags live only in your head\n\nship a dark mode? wrap it in a flag. want to test new pricing? flag. flags let you deploy on thursday and turn stuff on monday after the weekend metrics look calm.\n\n12. the readme still says \"run npm i\"\n\nonboard a new dev in under 30 minutes or you will be the only person who can release. docker-compose + seeded db + fake cards means anyone can checkout and sign up a test user in two commands.\n\ni rebuilt a vibe-coded mvp into investor-grade saas in 29 days last quarter using exactly these checkpoints. the founder closed a pre-seed two weeks after demo day because the product looked stable, not lucky.\n\nPs: you can reach me if you want a free code review [GenieOps](https://genie-ops.com)\n\nwhat part of your stack feels fine today but keeps you up at night? database, deploys, cost surprises? drop it below, happy to share scripts or templates that helped us move from \"works on my machine\" to \"ready for 100x\".",

Great for learning but nobody was paying for any of it.\n\nAt some point I started looking at where the money actually flows online, and it became pretty obvious: AI is the biggest opportunity right now with insane growth, and NSFW has been the most profitable niche on the internet since forever. When you combine both you get a massive market with surprisingly few serious players.\n\nSo I started building in this space.\n\nThe problem I ran into was that I needed to make sure my apps wouldn't generate anything illegal like CSAM or deepfakes of real people. But I also didn't want to limit the explicit content too much because that's what users are paying for.\n\nI couldn't find a good solution so I ended up building my own API: [kwikiai.com/guides/nsfw-ai-api](https://kwikiai.com/guides/nsfw-ai-api)\n\nI haven't even set up payments on it yet, I just want people to try it. If you have no idea what to build and you're tired of making things nobody uses, maybe give this niche a shot and let me know what you think.\n\nAlso, Merry Christmas to y'all!",

Only for Adobe to release firefly a week later. We pivoted to chat interface like Midjourney started with. Discord, Telegram and Wechat. Supported sdxl and pretty much ALL models from Civitai.\n\nWe were spending 2k per month on heavy servers. Got a bunch of free users and (very few) paying users. We kept that going for a couple of months until it just wasn't worth it.\n\nBut I think you'll do better focusing on a specific audience and we've progressed a bit. People understand the concept and potential of tools like this better now.\n\nBest of luck to you",

You have to stop coding, go generate images, edit them, and drag them in.\n\nWith the **Nano Banana** integration, I just vibed the visual requirements along with the code.\n\n* *Me:* \"I need fun images of energy sprites that match the content of each screen in the onboarding carousel - use a cool \"electric blue\" color palette.\"\n* *IDE:* Writes the SwiftUI code AND generates/places the pixel art assets.\n\nIt felt less like coding and more like directing a small studio.\n\nHas anyone else messed with the Nano Banana model yet? I feel like it's being slept on compared to the coding agents.\n\nThe app is here if you want to see the final UI: [aifootprint.ai](https://aifootprint.ai/)",

I can see which style I like between different models and then iterate from there. You buy a chunk of tokens and then use them up, with some models costing more than others. Great tool - not integrated in the same way nano banana is with Antigravity, but if you want a great image generation tool, it's a good one.

When normalized for typical prompt + response lengths (often several hundred to 1,000+ tokens), our estimate lands in the **same order of magnitude** as recent disclosures:\n\n* Google: **\\~0.24 Wh per median Gemini text query** (2025 production data)\n* OpenAI (Sam Altman): **\\~0.34 Wh per average ChatGPT query** Recent inference research also shows energy scales roughly linearly with **output tokens**, which dominate cost—making a token-based model both defensible and transparent.\n\nNOTE: We're revising to \\~.40 Wh per 1,000 tokens in the next update based on latest credible data.\n\n**Images:** \\~**2.9 Wh per image**  \nConsistent with Luccioni et al. (FAccT 2024) and still aligned with newer 2025 comparisons.\n\n**Video:** High by design (e.g., \\~**225 Wh per 10 seconds**)  \nRecent 2025 text-to-video benchmarks (Luccioni / Hugging Face) show short video generations around **\\~90 Wh**, with large variance depending on resolution, frames, and diffusion steps. We intentionally stay conservative because video energy use explodes quickly with quality.\n\nNOTE: We're revising to \\~10 Wh per second in the next update based on latest credible data.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nWe continuously scan 2025 research and frontier disclosures, adjust when consensus shifts, and communicate results as **ranges for impact awareness—not billing-grade precision.** As better telemetry becomes public, the model will keep improving.\n\nOn water: we didn’t include it because it’s **far messier and less standardized than energy** right now. Water use varies hugely by data-center location, cooling method, climate, and local power mix, and providers don’t report water at a per-model or per-query level. That makes estimates easy to misinterpret or overstate, even though water use is real and important. Energy is currently the **most measurable and comparable signal**, so we focused there first — but expanding “footprint” to include water (and other resources) is absolutely something we want to do as the data improves.",

      "text": "I’ve used the usual “one rules file to rule them all” approach for a while, and it works until your repo gets big.\n\nOnce I moved to a proper monorepo (mobile + web + backend), a single rules file started hurting more than helping. The agent would pull in a bunch of irrelevant constraints, blow the context window, and then confidently do the wrong thing anyway.\n\nSo I switched to a simple layered setup that’s been way more reliable for me. The basic idea: treat agent docs like you’d treat code. Scoped, modular, and loaded only when needed.\n\n# Layer 1: Discovery (AGENTS.md, nested)\n\nRoot has an [`AGENTS.md`](http://AGENTS.md), but I also drop smaller ones inside places like:\n\n* `apps/mobile/AGENTS.md`\n* `packages/ui/AGENTS.md`\n\nEach has docs relevant to the folder, so if one is inside components package I would explain how to structure components, refer to styling, etc.  \n  \nSo when the agent is working in `apps/mobile`, it picks up the mobile rules without being distracted by web/backend stuff. The root file stays short (I try to keep it under \\~100 lines) and the local ones only contain what’s specific to that area.\n\nI also switched fully to [**AGENTS.md**](http://AGENTS.md) and stopped maintaining separate tool-specific rules files. I use multiple IDEs and multiple agents, and keeping separate formats in sync was a mess. [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) is the first “one standard” I’ve seen that most coding agents are converging on.\n\nQuick note: **Claude Code doesn’t support** [**AGENTS.md**](http://AGENTS.md) **yet**, so I keep a [`CLAUDE.md`](http://CLAUDE.md) in the repo root that simply tells it to read the [`AGENTS.md`](http://AGENTS.md) in whatever folder it’s working in.\n\n# Layer 2: Specs (a vibe/ folder)\n\nThis is where I put the deep stuff that you don’t want injected all the time:\n\n* `vibe/schema.md` for the exact Supabase schema\n* `vibe/unistyles-math.md` for our styling logic that’s annoying to re-explain\n\nThe key is: the agent only reads these when the discovery layer points it there. So you get just-in-time context instead of permanently paying token rent for your schema.\n\n# Layer 3: Laws (AI_CONTEXT.md)\n\nThis is the tiny “non negotiables” file. Stuff that should hold true no matter which folder the agent is in.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Use Zustand. Never Redux.\n* Do not add new libraries without asking.\n* Stick to the repo’s core stack decisions.\n\nAnd yes, the root AGENTS.md references this file right near the top. I treat the root AGENTS.md as a router: it points to AI\\_CONTEXT.md for the global rules, then routes the agent to the nearest folder AGENTS.md for local conventions, and to vibe/ when it needs deep specs.\n\n*Why not just put these laws directly in the root AGENTS.md?* Because I want the root file to stay lean and navigational. Once you start stuffing it with global architecture rules, it slowly turns back into the same “one mega rules file” problem.\n\nAnd repeating those global rules in every nested [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) is even worse. They drift, get out of sync, and you end up maintaining docs more than code.\n\nSo AI\\_CONTEXT.md is the stable source of truth that every [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) can reference in one line. It keeps the root file short, avoids duplication across folders, and gives the agent a clear place to check before it invents a new stack decision.\n\n# The part that actually matters: keeping it up to date\n\nThe system only works if you maintain it, so I made it part of “definition of done”:\n\n* If the agent fixes something, it should update the relevant spec in `vibe/`.\n* If the agent makes the same mistake twice (like missing accessibility props), that becomes a rule in the relevant `AGENTS.md`.\n\nOver time it gets weirdly self-healing. Less repeat failure, less babysitting, fewer wasted tokens.\n\nI ended up baking this into my React Native starter ([Shipnative](https://shipnative.app)) mostly because I was tired of recreating the same structure every time. But even if you don’t use my starter, I’d still recommend the layered approach if your repo is scaling to save tokens.\n\nCurious if anyone else is doing nested or inherited rule files like this, or if you’ve found a better way to scope context in monorepos.",

          "text": "If an application is “vibe-coded” in a few hours and considered complete, it is almost always limited to a front-end interface. In most cases, the backend is either unfinished or incorrectly implemented, and the developer lacks the ability to properly diagnose or correct those issues.\n\nChoosing not to focus on syntax is not inherently a problem. I have taken that approach myself and maintain stable professional employment. However, this path requires strong debugging and reasoning skills. Without those, the tradeoff becomes a liability rather than an advantage.\n\nA recurring issue is the absence of basic validation. Many developers claim to have built functional systems without running even minimal checks, cross-validation, or structured debugging. As a result, these systems often fail under real conditions.\n\nRather than producing superficial applications that replicate existing work, I focus on building robust back-end systems. The emphasis is on correctness, structure, and mathematical verifiability. AI tools are not a substitute for understanding; they require precise instructions, well-defined constraints, and careful evaluation of outputs. Even then, human oversight remains essential.\n\nThere is a tendency at one extreme to dismiss these approaches as impractical, and at the other to treat AI as a shortcut that removes the need for rigor. In reality, effective systems emerge only when structure, verification, and accountability are treated as first-class concerns.",

It would verify what happened, make sure it’s repeatable, and then label it as “good” or “bad,” but in a way where “good” or “bad” isn’t always fixed. On top of that, it would run multiple slightly different variations at once and map the logic using hashes, Hamming distance, and similar methods.\n\nIf people can code this well with AI without checking  themselves or the code a random bot wrote, I honestly wonder why no one has made a system like this yet here instead of some crappy app Someome else already made with a crappy UI wrapper on it…🤨",

I do that for awhile until the AI agree on a plan and then let Claude Code rip.

Sometimes the output is bloody awful but after initially disagreeing hard I’ve come to admit it definitely saves a hell of a lot of time.\n\nClaude is different. I’ve recently started using what they suggest whereby one agent manages multiple and it’s seriously impressive - I’m getting high quality and still low usage costs. I don’t hit my 5x usage most of the time. But, there’s a learning curve. Cursor doesn’t have one - it’s so simple you’ve got to be a muppet to not figure it out. Claude also takes absolutely ages for the output in comparison. \n\nClaude’s got a lot of dev ex issues that really are embarrassing at times. Like the console going ape shit, and I tried CC vs code plugin which just sucked (2 months ago, will give it another go soon). \n\nI think Claude just needs to improve the experience and they’ll dominate. But for now, I’d say for cursor wins for velocity. The speed is so much quicker (comparing opus to opus).",

At first I thought, “okay, traffic spike, fair enough.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ytvovtd2z9g1.png?width=410&format=png&auto=webp&s=001ca3f36a5536177442e102ff3fdf4793d9b2a5\n\nBut after reading the comments, one thing stood out.  \nA lot of people said vibe coded apps are **not production ready**.\n\nThey were right.\n\nWhen I reviewed my own code, I found some pretty bad stuff:\n\n* Base64 images hard coded in the code and MongoDB\n* No proper image hosting\n* Things that worked fine at small scale but failed under real traffic\n\nSo I paused and fixed it properly:\n\n* Wrote scripts to migrate base64 images out\n* Moved everything to an image hosting service\n* Cleaned up caching, fetching, and payload sizes\n\nResult:  \nFaster loads, lower bandwidth, no more Vercel warnings, overall much smoother.\n\nBig takeaway for anyone vibe coding:  \nVibe coding is powerful, but it does **not know everything**. You have to guide it.  \nIf you blindly accept outputs, you will ship problems.  \nIf you combine it with basic engineering sense, you can move insanely fast.\n\nStill vibe coded the fixes too, just with better constraints this time.\n\nCurious how others handle taking a vibe coded MVP into real production.",

The important part is that you noticed, paused, and fixed it instead of doubling down or ignoring the warnings.\n\nThe framing I’ve found helpful is: vibe coding is for discovery, engineering is for durability. The MVP’s job is to validate demand, not architecture. Once the signal is real, you switch hats and start applying constraints, budgets, and boring best practices which is exactly what you did.",

Thats literally why there is like alpha and beta releases of software before it’s even considered “Prod” lol. \n\nKind of a weird post IMO. This is the same tune anti-AI people have been saying “Yeah but once it gets to prod the slop falls apart” when in reality the same thing happens to non ai generated code too. \n\nIf you know what you are doing, you’ll release better code in advance. However, people seem to gloss over the fact that people usually figure out what they are doing via years of mistakes and learnings. \n\nThe only reason an experienced dev knows the right way to do something is because they did it the wrong way first and/or watched someone else do it the wrong way (when they themselves didn’t yet know the right way.)\n\nThat doesn’t mean AI is only generating slop. Thats why experience devs can code with AI and not generate slop - it becomes a force multiplier for someone who knows what they are doing. And for someone who doesn’t, it allows them to quickly learn the right way to do things and avoid making many of those mistakes - but obviously you’re still going to mess up whether or not you have AI building the code if you’re a new dev.",

My experience just happened to be a fast, compressed version of that learning loop. The takeaway for me wasn’t “don’t vibe code,” it was “ship fast, then be ready to switch gears and engineer properly once reality hits.",

Here's the stack:\n\n\n\nMusic: Suno AI (prompted for 1950s jazz in different instrument styles - piano lead, saxophone lead, trumpet lead, etc.)\n\n\n\nVoice: ElevenLabs (created a DJ persona named \"Sonny Nix\" with custom V3 prompts for different emotions)\n\n\n\nWorkflows: n8n (pulls scripts, generates voice drops, arranges files in order)\n\n\n\nAssembly: Logic Pro (crossfades, ducking when voice comes in)\n\n\n\nVideo: FFmpeg one-liner to loop a static image over 3 hours of audio\n\n\n\nImage: DALL-E (1950s radio booth aesthetic)\n\n\n\nWebsite: Lovable (built a /radio page with episode player)\n\n\n\nAlmost the whole thing runs on prompts, APIs, and workflows. I wrote maybe 10 lines of actual code total (mostly FFmpeg commands). Tbh some things I do have to do manually, I just need it to feel real.\n\n\n\nTwo days ago this didn't exist. Now it's a daily radio station.\n\n\n\nWhat started as \"wouldn't it be funny if...\" turned into my favorite thing I've ever built.\n\n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W4z5eHIOag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W4z5eHIOag)\n\n\n\nHappy to share prompts/workflow details if anyone wants to build something similar.",

      "text": "I've been working on my main SaaS for over 2 years now and brought it to $16k MRR. Along the way, I've always been tinkering with other ideas and side projects.\n\nI've tried a lot of things:\n\n* Vibe-coded a few apps with Lovable & Supabase\n* Built 2 internal tools starting with Chef, then iterating in Cursor\n* Built 3 different mobile apps with React Native + Convex\n\nAll of them flopped, but I built them mostly for the experience.\n\nRecently, I started working on a new product, an email marketing tool for SaaS founders. All those learnings helped me build a full-featured app with a reliable backend and AWS integration in about 2 weeks (while still running my other startup).\n\nHere's what I've learned:\n\n**Two non-negotiables**\n\n1. **Use the best model available.** Go into debt if you have to. The difference between Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5 is massive. If you're stuck on older models, you'll be much slower. Right now, it's Claude Code with Opus 4.5. In a month, it might be something else - stay flexible.\n2. **You still need technical knowledge.** AI will produce nonsense sometimes. You need to catch it and correct it.\n\n\n\n**Get the foundations right**\n\nThe most important thing is nailing your architecture early. When you have a solid foundation - properly typed database, coherent structure - iterating on features becomes 10x easier.\n\nHere's what I recommend:\n\n1. **Use TypeScript with strict typings.** No shortcuts.\n2. **Use tRPC (or similar)** to get strong types between frontend and backend.\n3. **Set up your styling system early.** Shadcn works great for most cases.\n4. **Configure ESLint + strict tsconfig** from day one.\n5. **Use a typed ORM.** I prefer Drizzle.\n6. **Think deeply about your schema.** What data do you need to store? How will you process it? I like to brainstorm with Gemini first, get a dump of all the info, then send it to Claude Code to implement.\n\nWhy does all this matter? When you have proper types end-to-end, it's 10x easier for AI to understand all the relationships in your codebase.\n\n**My take on testing**\n\nI strongly believe you should have unit tests for all your core functionality. Mock your database using something like PGlite and you're good to go.\n\nThis helps you move fast while making sure your app actually works. Most of your endpoints should be \\~5 lines where you just call a well-tested function.\n\nAs for UI tests and E2E tests - I don't think they help at this stage. They slow you down, and you'll be changing your UI constantly. If you want to iterate quickly, skip them for now.\n\n**One more tip: keep configuration in code**\n\nWhenever you can, avoid manual setup. If you need to do something on AWS or GCP, use Terraform. Don't go through dashboard hell manually clicking around. It'll speed you up massively in the long run.\n\n**Writing the code**\n\nRun a few agents in parallel. Once you already have the schema, it's easy to add different API requests, screens, etc. at the same time.\n\nEvery 4–6 hours, stop and review everything you've done. Use Cursor Review, ask Claude Code to give you feedback about your PR, and verify that it added zero unexpected fields in the database. Make sure the flow still works as expected.\n\nDon't allow AI to write code for days without review - it'll be incredibly hard to clean up and make useful.\n\n\n\nThat's the flow. If you're building a SaaS and need to set up email sequences for onboarding or retention, check out Sequenzy - we have a generous free tier and you can start sending sequences within minutes of signing up.\n\nGood luck, and ship fast!",

When you start from zero and fully rely on vibe coding, it’s very easy to build something messy without even realizing it\n\nYou move fast, but you don’t really know why things work and when something breaks in a non obvious way, you’re kinda stuck. Recently I even saw a guy talking about hacking vibe coded apps because of basic security mistakes, and honestly that didn’t surprise me at all\n\nAI tools are powerful, no doubt, but vibe coding everything from zero feels more like hype than some “AI takes over coding” moment\n\nFor learning and speed it’s great, for real structure and long term quality, not so much",

Yes! Is it functional? Yes! Is it scalable? Yes and no, haha. Do I have the result like someone with experience would? No and yes.\n\nSo, keep learning while you code with Vibe because creating for the sake of creating is useless if you don't have a solid foundation and don't start from there.\n\nNow that AI has arrived, we've realized that coding is just one step towards achieving something. It was never the ultimate link, and even if you're not at the top, it's still the ultimate link.\n\n\n\nAnyone can code; learning the basics, conditions, best practices, logic, and scalability is what will add value today.\n\n\nAnyone who is already a programmer and open to AI HAS A MISSILE UP THEIR ASS to boost their work speed, hahaha.\n\n\n\nNow that I'm in this world, I have the utmost respect for programmers.

Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and Google Fonts for high-end aesthetics.\n    2. **The API**: Perform a POST request to https://html2png.dev/api/convert.\n    3. **Usage**:\n       - **Body (required)**: Send the raw, clean HTML string directly in the request body. No JSON wrap or escaping needed.\n       - **Query Params**: Pass dimensions and options as URL parameters (e.g., ?width=1200&height=630&format=png&deviceScaleFactor=2).\n    4. **Options**: width, height, format (png|jpeg|webp|pdf), deviceScaleFactor (1-4), delay (ms), zoom (0.1-3.0), omitBackground (true/false).\n    5. **Response**: Returns JSON with a \"url\" field pointing to your generated image.\n    ",

Do this last if you are vibe coding.)\n\nThe \"Fortress Architecture\" Prompt\nCopy and paste the text below. Replace [YOUR TECH STACK] with your specific details (e.g., \"Node.js/Express with React\" or \"Apache/PHP\").\nRole: Act as an Elite Application Security Architect and Lead Penetration Tester.\nContext: I am hardening a production environment running on [YOUR TECH STACK]. I require a zero-trust, defense-in-depth security strategy.\nTask: Generate a comprehensive \"Full-Spectrum Hardening Protocol\".\nFor every category below, you must provide:\n * Attack Vector: How the exploit works.\n * Verification Command: curl, nmap, openssl, or code audit regex to find it.\n * remediation Code: The specific config (Nginx/Apache), header syntax, or code logic to fix it.\nSpecial Requirement: Dynamic Nonce Logic\nYou must include a dedicated section on implementing Cryptographic Nonces. Do not just recommend them; provide the logic for:\n * Generating a cryptographically strong random nonce per request.\n * Injecting this nonce into the Content Security Policy (CSP) header (script-src 'nonce-...').\n * Passing this nonce to the frontend/template to whitelist inline scripts.\n * Using nonces/tokens for CSRF protection in forms.\nThe Expanded Vulnerability Scope:\nPhase 1: Network & Infrastructure (The Outer Wall)\n * Port Hygiene: Scan for and close non-essential ports (21, 22, 3306, 6379, 27017).\n * Protocol Hardening: Enforce TLS 1.2/1.3 only; disable older suites.\n * Subdomain/DNS: Check for subdomain takeovers and dangling CNAMEs.\n * CDN & WAF: Verify \"Untrusted CDN\" resource loading (SRI hashes) and WAF bypass risks.\nPhase 2: HTTP Security Headers (The Shield)\n * Advanced CSP: Strict CSP using Nonce-based allowlisting (no 'unsafe-inline').\n * HSTS: Preload directive inclusion + max-age > 1 year.\n * Permissions Policy: Lock down camera, mic, geolocation, and USB.\n * Referrer & Frame Control: Strict-Origin-When-Cross-Origin and DENY.\nPhase 3: Authentication & Session Management (The Gatekeeper)\n * Identity: Hardening against Brute Force, Credential Stuffing, and Password Spraying.\n * Session IDs: High entropy, secure storage, and rotation on login.\n * Cookies: Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, and __Host- prefix usage.\n * JWT Hardening: Check for None algorithm attacks and weak signing secrets.\n * MFA: Enforcement logic and bypass prevention.\nPhase 4: Injection & Input Validation (Internal Defense)\n * Injection (SQLi/NoSQLi/Command): Parameterized queries and input sanitization layers.\n * XSS (Reflected/Stored/DOM): Output encoding strategies and DOM-purify integration.\n * SSR (Server-Side Request Forgery): URL whitelisting and metadata service blocking.\n * XXE (XML External Entities): Disabling DTD processing in parsers.\n * Deserialization: Preventing execution of untrusted object data.\nPhase 5: Information & Logic (The Vault)\n * Info Disclosure: Scrub Server, X-Powered-By, stack traces, sourcemaps, and .git folders.\n * API Security: Mass Assignment, IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References), and Broken Function Level Authorization.\n * Business Logic: Rate limiting (preventing DoS/scraping) and Race Conditions.\n * Dependency Supply Chain: npm/pip audit pipelines and SBOM generation.\n * Breach Detection: Integration with \"Have I Been Pwned\" Pwned Passwords API.\nOutput Format: Group by phase. Highlight Critical risks in Red. Provide code examples specifically for [YOUR TECH STACK].\nKey Upgrades in This Prompt\n * Nonce Logic Enforced: Instead of just saying \"use CSP,\" this prompt forces the AI to explain the mechanism of generating a random string on the server, putting it in the header, and printing it in the HTML. This is the only true way to block XSS while allowing necessary scripts.\n * OWASP/SANS Alignment: It specifically names attack vectors like IDOR, SSRF, XXE, and Deserialization—these are critical backend vulnerabilities that simple \"checklist\" prompts often miss.\n * Zero-Trust focus: It asks for __Host- cookie prefixes and TLS version enforcement, moving beyond basic SSL checks.\n * Supply Chain Security: It adds SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) and dependency auditing, which is currently a massive focus in cybersecurity.",

          "text": "Hey there, you're getting a lot of less-than-helpful responses, and as someone who's recently started down this vibecode evolution, I wanted to engage with what you created in an open honest way.  For what it's worth I tried your app, and at least from one free scan, I already got value out of it, that's certainly a win in my book 😉\n\nFirst, I went to your site on mobile, the mobile experience isn't great.  I've noticed this too with my vibecoded apps, a lot of their layout just simply doesn't work on mobile. Easy to fix though once you know.\n\nSecond, I actually think you're providing real convenience bringing together several different already publicly available scans.  The feedback is accurate, the results are actionable, and I really think the problem space makes sense for it. Most vulnerabilities are simply things people don't think about yet, which is why having a tool exist when people _are_ ready makes so much sense.\n\nNow, some more critical thoughts - I don't really know where you go from here.  I think your free starter scans makes a lot of sense, but I don't really resonate with what paid premium is offering.  I think this is really where the majority of your work lies next for this - figuring out what _other_ repeatable value-add you can provide.  Ongoing scans is alright, but again, think about my previous point - the truth is businesses and devs don't _want_ to think about security all the time.  They know they have to, but only ever so often, and when it's most convenient. \n\nOverall I think you have a useful service.  I think of it like the one json lint+format website I always use, or that url encoder/decoder site.  Yes yes, I know jq and all that jazz.  But sometimes people wanna just copy paste something quick and click a button instead of have some command memorized.  A service though, like any of the ones I mentioned, is not quite yet a _product_.  But I think you're certainly closer than a lot of other stuff I've seen.\n\nDon't let the naysayers get you down, I used your site, it found stuff I'm gonna have Claude fix tomorrow.  You're certainly moving in the right direction, just a little bit more to go 😉.  Good luck!",

Usually, if I tried to build this by hand, it would take me 3 months and the UI would look pretty bad.\n\n​A friend told me to try Antigravity. I spent one intense week \"vibe coding\" with it, and the results blew me away.\n\n​The Setup ($0 total)\n​The only thing I paid for was the domain on Namecheap for $10 which is completely optional. Everything else is free:\n​Framework: Next.js (hosted for free on Vercel).\n​Database: MongoDB M0 free tier.\n​Speed: Even though the database is free, I used caching, async fetching, and compression to keep the site feeling smooth and fast.\n\n​Features & UI\n​I don’t have a pro design background, but I have a good \"grip\" on what looks good. I was tired of seeing \"vibe coded\" sites that all use the same ugly gradients and layouts. I pushed Antigravity to make something that looks like a real, professional app.\n\n​It has everything a community needs:\n​You get a notification when someone likes or comments on a story.\n​The layout is clean and simple so you can just focus on reading.\n​The community features help you find new stories easily.\n\n​The Lesson\n​Before this, my manual builds took forever and looked crappy. Now, I finished a high-quality app in 7 days. It’s crazy how fast you can go when you use these tools correctly. I spent my time making sure the \"vibe\" was right and the code was optimized.\n\n​Take a look here: https://www.thestorybits.com/\n\n​What do you guys think? Can you tell it was vibe coded, or did I hide it well?",

      "text": "I challenged myself to build a \"Visual Fridge Scanner\" in a single sprint. The goal: Take a messy photo of a fridge and turn it into a high-end, Michelin-star recipe (because I’m tired of eating plain pasta).\n\nIt’s live now at [**fridge-feast.online**](https://fridge-feast.online), but since this sub is about *how* we build, here is the breakdown of the stack and the prompt engineering.\n\n# 🛠️ The Vibe Stack (2025 Edition)\n\n* **The Brain:** **Gemini 3 Flash Preview** (via Google AI Studio).\n   * *Why:* The new Flash model is insanely fast for multimodal vision tasks. It creates the recipe before the loading spinner even finishes one rotation.\n* **The Environment:** **Google AI Studio**. I used the prompt interface to \"vibe code\" the backend logic and generate the Python snippets.\n* **Hosting:** **Google Cloud Run**.\n   * *Why:* I wanted it serverless. It scales to zero when no one is cooking (saving me money) but handles the Reddit \"hug of death\" if it goes viral.\n* **Frontend:** \\[React/Next.js - *optional: insert your FE framework*\\]\n\n# 🧠 The \"Vision\" Workflow\n\nThe hardest part was getting the AI to accurately identify ingredients from a blurry photo and return data my frontend could actually use (not just a paragraph of text).\n\n**The System Prompt (The Secret Sauce):** I defined the model as a \"Culinary Inventory Specialist\" in AI Studio. The key was enforcing a strict JSON schema so I didn't have to write complex regex parsers on the backend.\n\nHere is the exact System Instruction I used:\n\n    Role: You are an AI Culinary Inventory Specialist for \"Fridge Feast.\"\n    \n    Task: Analyze the provided image of a refrigerator/pantry.\n    1. Identify every visible edible ingredient.\n    2. Ignore non-food items (Tupperware without clear contents).\n    3. Estimate rough quantities where visible.\n    \n    CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:\n    You must output ONLY valid JSON.\n    {\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item_name\": \"string (e.g., 'Bell Pepper')\",\n          \"category\": \"string (Produce, Dairy, etc.)\",\n          \"confidence\": \"high/medium/low\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"chef_roast\": \"string (A witty, 1-sentence observation about how sad their fridge looks)\"\n    }\n\n  \n☁️ Deployment (Cloud Run)\n\nI wrapped the app in a simple Docker container. Since I'm using the Gemini API, the backend is lightweight.\n\n1. Vibe coded the `Dockerfile` in AI Studio.\n2. `gcloud run deploy fridge-feast`\n3. Mapped the domain. Done.\n\n  \n⚠️ Lessons Learned\n\n* **Flash vs. Pro:** I started with Pro, but Gemini 3 Flash is actually accurate enough for ingredient detection and *much* cheaper/faster.\n* **The \"Roast\":** Adding the `chef_roast` field in the JSON was a game changer. It gives the app personality without needing a separate API call.\n\n# 🚀 Try it out\n\nI’m looking for feedback on the latency. Since it's on Cloud Run + Gemini 3 Flash, it should be near-instant.\n\nCheck it out: [**fridge-feast.online**](http://fridge-feast.online)\n\nLet me know if the scanner works on your fridge or if it hallucinates a \"Vintage Cabernet\" out of your hot sauce.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo73wx461h9g1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1013e8ff469ba0dcded9854a59856d5e05d815c\n\n  \n\n\n",

While not an absolute expert, I know how a lot of these work l, and what part of their software is a pain in the ass for our operators and/or myself. \n\nAI solved all that. \n\nI “developed”, first as a hobby, then as my boss instructed, a few programs or apps that work wonder. Our internal IT team was either too busy or too lazy but being able to create any program that does X after the file is transferred but before being processed by our printer is very, very convenient. I’ve been able to add margins, automatically resize prints and sort them, identify panels to degrade them to save ink, catch duplicates and just a whole bunch of print stuff I won’t bore you with. \n\nCan I replace a real dev? Hell no \nDo I want to? Nope\n\nBut just being able to tweak the way we can work with an operator’s vision, seeing the value of small adjustments that a real IT guy wouldn’t bother with is priceless and making our lives easier. I also like to think that being actually on the field help see stuff differently, in both empathy and practicality. The people capable of fixing the intentional design flaw in a Fuji 7700 either didn’t care or didn’t know it existed. I did but wasn’t capable of doing anything about it. Well, until Codex came along. \n\nSo despite all the shit stuff coming out of AI, I am at least thankful for that. \n",

I think the main difference between a Vibe coder in a real programmer is the logic and implementation. The vibe coder at least has that initial good thinking of laying down foundations and planning out what needs to be coded , which is an important skill.\n\nFor me personally, I wouldn't feel right Vibe coding everything from scratch. I want to build the logic myself and understand it very well , and use AI as a tool to make my own coding better",

I'm still intrigued and anxious about not having used my youth to learn this skill, but little by little, step by step, I'm trying to understand what I'm doing.\n\n\nBut after reading what you wrote, you gave me a boost of happiness and a pat on the back.\n\n\n\nNow that it's reached ordinary people (like me) and we have the power to \"create,\" I've created functional things thanks to AI for personal and family use. I know that what AI creates is very difficult to predict because I understand that it prioritizes functionality over good security practices, handling sensitive data, and code architecture if you don't give it the right instructions.\nThat's where I want to start gaining knowledge.\n\nI found a way that I think I've understood well.\n\nNow, when creating an app or SaaS, I decide beforehand:\nFront-end framework\nBack-end framework\nWhat would my database be?\nI choose components or libraries, I think they're called.\nAnd I tell it not to put any sensitive data on the front end.\n\nAlso, that it separates and has a logical architecture on one side, a type on another side, and a style on yet another side (I don't know if it's a good thing, but since I don't know how to code as such, I like to think about it a lot when I create a system, seeing it from the front end, so to speak, and knowing how each interface of my app works and what happens behind the scenes for everything to happen; it's complicated for me to think about it the other way around).\n\n\nWell, I hope I've made myself clear. I've been at this for 2 months. Throughout all of this, I take advantage of every spare moment to continue learning and experimenting.\n\n\nI'd love to know exactly what I'm creating at all times, but oh well, I have to study and gradually learn more.\n\nLet's aim for 1% more than yesterday.",

Threw two away, kept the best one, learned something from all three.\n\nThe biggest shift? I’m not afraid to experiment anymore. Bad idea? Cool, try another. The cost of being wrong dropped to nearly zero.\n\nStill need to understand what the code is doing that part hasn’t changed.

It resembles front-end development without backend accountability—except worse, because the developers often do not understand the code they are producing at all.\n\nThe pattern is predictable: a user interface that looks acceptable (or is lifted from another project), paired with a fragile or nonfunctional backend that is nonetheless claimed to work. This is not just poor engineering practice; it creates real legal risk. Operating under an LLC or similar structure does not eliminate liability when a product is marketed as functional but is demonstrably not.\n\nShipping software you do not understand is inherently dangerous. It is comparable to selling a bicycle without realizing it contains a hidden hazard—eventually, the failure will surface, and the responsibility will fall on the seller.\n\nIf someone intends to purchase code or generate it with AI and then sell an application, they have a responsibility to understand the fundamentals of debugging and verification. These are not advanced or inaccessible skills; they are basic requirements. If a person cannot reason about what their code is doing or validate that it works as claimed, they should not be deploying or selling software in the first place.",

I do “vibe code,” just not in the way most people in this space seem to do it.\n\nTo me, syntax is essentially structured logic. If you design a system that reasons about something like Python in a mathematical or constraint-based way, that can genuinely help an AI produce correct output. What doesn’t make sense is building yet another app that has already been done a thousand times, where nine times out of ten it is just a UI wrapped around a weak or nonexistent backend. Many people using these tools don’t actually understand how the backend works at all.\n\nWatching this happen feels like seeing someone discover fire and then repeatedly burn their hand instead of learning how to use it properly.\n\nIn my case, I am using AI to help build a virtual machine, and it is working reasonably well. The only reason it works is because I actively debug, I understand what constraints to apply, and I know how to verify the results. AI can be powerful, but only if you treat it as a system that needs structure, checks, and responsibility rather than as a shortcut that replaces understanding.",

You should not be building or deploying systems when you are unsure what they are doing internally. If you do not understand the behavior of your code, you cannot guarantee correctness, safety, or reliability.\n\nThat said, this problem is not limited to beginners. A large percentage of working developers fall into the same trap. They encounter bugs constantly because they act as though they understand the system when they do not. The issue is not the presence of bugs. It is the lack of honest understanding and accountability for how and why those bugs occur.\n\n(Normal devs can be just as bad if not worse, they just like to brag a bunch)",

Your reaction actually proved it.\n\nYou need to debug. You need to understand what you’re doing, not just go, “yeah, that sounds right.”\n\nI never said most coders don’t have bugs. Did I? The main point is you getting mad at me for stating the obvious. Do you realize I know very little syntax? Syntax isn’t the problem, and your reaction just proves my point.\n\nI couldn’t care less about learning syntax. I’m building a system that will reason through not just syntax, but the math itself. Stop getting mad at solid input.\n\nAlso, if your system has 20 major flaws for every 100 lines of code, that code is terrible. And if you’re not smart enough to actually debug it, what are you going to do? Pay someone else?\n\nHonestly, if I were you, I would at least try to reason about the system you’re making. I use math to validate mine because I build at the kernel level, which is why I’m so critical. Even most devs I work with who understand the syntax can’t reason about what the backend actually does. Most devs make a ton of errors. I see it firsthand. You probably make more unless you actually know how to check your work. The systems I make can’t have a single mistake or the whole thing fails.\n\nYou’re probably making some UI app, which is a different category. If you’re making an app that’s been done a thousand times, that’s one thing. But if you’re building a system that people might actually pay for, it’s not going to be a simple UI with an even simpler backend. This isn’t even a debate.",

I don't disagree with the OP, but I've worked for many large companies that spin up projects, throw fly-by-night contractors at them, launch them, and then just hope. And after that - nobody cares to touch the code, as it's a mess, and it was already over budget.\n\nTwo wrongs don't make a right, but don't dismiss AI patterns improving.

Obviously there are amazing Indian developers but not for that price. We tried them out and frequently they wouldn't do basic tests of anything. We'd lose clients to outsourced Devs and they would regularly come back to us just before going live with everything broken and untested and we'd charge triple our largest rates to bail them out of it.\n\nThen there are things like the Ashley Madison hack. A website that should have cared about security more than any other, literally making money out of helping people have affairs just had terrible security practises.\n\nThe vast majority of sites, apps, applications, projects, products, suck. That's just always been true. It's fine, it's how the world works. Generally having more shitty versions of something coincides with having more amazing versions of something.\n\nVibe coding is amazing where domain knowledge is more important than security, performance or maintainability of the code. I've just vibe coded an app that I think will be amazing. Roughly 4-5 people max will ever use the specific app, and really it's aimed at just one person. The output the the app will feed into something out that many people will use, but the output is a csv file that does not contain code.\n\nSo what if my app is poor from a code point of view. If it works those handful of people will be crazily more productive.",
