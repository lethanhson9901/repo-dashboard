The reason it takes days is because I get sidetracked, and bored and that leads to me making stupid mistakes. Not every time, but it's happened.\n\nOr documentation. Or just brainstorming, which can be done with a coworker which I still do, but sometimes they are busy and don't want to be pulled out of their focus just to brainstorm with me and thus risking confusing them.\n\nBut I'd never just prompt the ai to do a multi layered task. Not even with specific instructions. I have them do each step at a time. Plan out directories, each script as a blank pseudo code script, evaluating each and every step of the way.\n\nAnd most of the time I set it to only read, not write or edit, because I'm setting things up, I'm connecting things together. Sometimes the ai tries to do more but it's easy enough to give it another role to know that it should be an advisor. I review the ai output just as it reviews mine, taking turns back and forth.\n\nAnd sure, it's not as fast as having the ai execute everything autonomously and getting it right, but it's far more effective than having it execute and getting it wrong. It's also occasionally slower than having me do everything by hand when I don't need to refactor or forget something, but it far more efficient and saves time when I have days when I'm forgetful or God forbid when there's silent errors due to the human factor.\n\nIt's a tool, treat it as an extension of yourself.

It’s far easier and lazier to reach for ad hominem and other logical fallacies than to come up with a real argument.\n\nMy post was obviously a joke, but there’s some truth to it. You see countless posts here about being stuck at the last 10% or struggling as projects grow. Those of use who have lived through delivering and supporting real world projects know that getting the code written is a small portion of the job, and by looking at the code that AI produces you can see that its architectural and technical decisions don’t tend to be very strong.\n\nSo you’d probably say something like oh well you should have just specced that all out, and it’s true that AI will do better then (assuming you follow a clear workflow, carefully manage context, and don’t give it too many steps at once), but the reality is that humans aren’t good at speccing out every details and many details (especially edge cases) are only uncovered later, and stakeholders give you ambiguous and vague requirements more often than not.\n\nIf you write a spec that is detailed enough and covers all the edge cases for an AI to do the job without issue, a human could have done it just as well with that spec, and while it might not be done faster, the code writing is the cheapest part of human software development.",

It’s fairly obvious that when you criticize someone for exploring a new way to build, you’re mostly just guarding the ability to create.\nI totally get the frustration. It must be incredibly jarring to spend years mastering complex syntax and struggling through the grind, only to see people bypass that initiation and build things in days. I can see why that feels like a devaluation of the craft. If I saw my specialized role being complemented or challenged by something getting exponentially better every day, I’d probably feel a bit defensive too.\nBut here’s the thing: AI isn't going anywhere. It’s understandable to want to protect the old ways, but the sooner we accept this is the new baseline, the less likely we are to be the ones left behind.\nAlso, a bit of an anecdotal observation: In my time in the industry, I’ve noticed a recurring theme where high level technical skill doesn't always overlap with user facing empathy or visual creativity. That’s usually why PMs exist, right?\nThe fact that creatives can now stumble through the code, messily for now, is clearly disruptive. It’s interesting to see the traditional gatekeepers of the tech stack lose a bit of that exclusive leverage. It’s a major shift in the power dynamic, and while it might be uncomfortable for some, it’s honestly fascinating to watch the prima donna era of dev culture evolve into something more accessible.\nChange is hard, but maybe it's time to embrace the vibe?",

In fact, if someone vibe coded some bullshit at my company and said \"hey, look at this\" ... I can just write a better brief and plan better and have it coded better in *hours*. I don't have to fix shit, I'll just do it on my own better.\n\nPeople who do know how to code can now spend more time planning. I spend way more time architecting than I used to because I spend a lot less time actually coding. The actual time I spent fixing bugs is when it interacts with code I've already written.\n\nOf course you have to refactor. Of course you have to bug-fix. Of course you have to sometimes dump the feature and start over.

All just sitting there. So I spent a couple months vibecoding a marketplace that handles all that friction — you upload your file and AI takes care of the rest. I'm honestly really happy with how it turned out, and I already published a couple of my own tools on it.\n\nSeeing this thread hits home. If anyone here has tools collecting dust and wants to test whether people would actually pay for them, I'd really appreciate you giving it a shot ([xenyyo.com](https://xenyyo.com)).

With the embedded tasks I currently have, the loop of making changes to trying them out just takes way too long to tolerate all those non-obvious shortcuts and mistakes that AI makes. Also, this is a piece of software that absolutely should not crash, so it's just not faster to read the AI code thoroughly enough.\n\nI already spend enough time reviewing code of colleagues, I don't want to just do code review, especially as reviewing AI code is extremely tedious and annoying.

I doubt an AI-generated app would put the correct safeguards in place to prevent users from spamming too many API requests as part of their daily use of the app.\n\nThere's also the issue of monetization of traffic/map data, which the Apple maps TOS seems to cover via licensing. Again, not something AI is usually aware of when generating apps, given how often AI-generated apps violate TOS/EULAs of APIs they're intended to interact with.\n\nLastly, if they intend to expand the app to other platforms, they'll have to pay more for Apple Maps API access, since the free quota is only available for iOS/macOS apps. At that point they'd need to rewrite it to use a different traffic API that is more cross-platform friendly in terms of TOS, to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience.",

Even Google doesn't have 100% penetration, so it's beyond naive thinking you will even get a fraction of that.\n\nSo if two people at the airport are using this, how do you extrapolate that to how many are actually at the airport?\n\nThis is not a trivial problem, since you need to know age ranges, user behaviors, dwell time, gender, etc. to even have a shot at making an informed guess. That's why Google can do this, they DO know all of that. The only way to solve this without doing that is to pour in hundreds of millions for adverts or promos to get as high of market penetration as possible.\n\nIf you really want to stay in this space, you ought to consider pivoting to something more niche like tracking for people who hike together, or tracking friends at a festival or something. Those all have compeition too, but less so than this idea.",

          "text": "r/webdev • Posted by u/SecurityAudit\nSite got a 50/100 on HTTP Observatory. Am I cooked? (Analysis of dropapp.app)\n\nHey everyone, just ran site dropapp.app through the Mozilla HTTP Observatory and... it’s not looking great. I’m sitting at a 50/100.\n\nI took a look at my raw headers, and it seems like I’m missing some \"defense-in-depth\" basics. I wanted to break down exactly how an attacker could actually pivot from these missing headers to stealing my database or API keys.\n\nIf you’re a beginner, take this as a cautionary tale on why headers aren't just \"extra credit.\"\n\n1. The \"Open Door\" Policy (Missing CSP)\nMy report shows zero Content Security Policy (CSP).\n * The Attack: This is the big one. If I have a single unsanitized input field, an attacker can perform a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.\n * The Breach: Without a CSP, the browser will happily run any script the attacker injects. They can script a \"scraper\" that runs in an admin's browser, finds the \"Settings\" page where my AWS or Stripe API keys are displayed, and sends them straight to their own server.\n\n2. Clickjacking (Missing X-Frame-Options)\nI noticed I don't have X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors.\n * The Attack: An attacker can load my site inside an invisible <iframe> on their malicious site.\n * The Breach: They can trick me (the admin) into clicking a button on their site that perfectly aligns with a \"Delete Database\" or \"Reset Admin Password\" button on my hidden site. It’s a classic UI redressing attack.\n\n3. Cookie Hijacking\nThe scan flagged that my session cookies likely aren't hardened (missing HttpOnly and Secure flags).\n * The Attack: If that XSS attack from step 1 works, the attacker can just run document.cookie.\n * The Breach: If my session ID is in there, they can just copy-paste it into their own browser and poof—they are logged in as me. Once they have admin access, the database is essentially theirs to download.\n\n4. Infrastructure Leaks\nMy headers are being a bit too chatty:\n * X-Served-By: cache-bfi-krnt7300081-BFI\n * Server-Timing: cfOrigin;dur=8\n * The Risk: This tells attackers exactly which edge nodes and origin behaviors I'm using. It’s like giving a burglar a blueprint of which windows in your house have the weakest locks.\n\nThe Game Plan to Fix It:\nI'm going to start by injecting these into my config:\n * Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): (Already there, but needs a long max-age).\n * Content-Security-Policy: Even a basic default-src 'self' would do wonders.\n * X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff: To stop MIME-sniffing exploits.\n * X-Frame-Options: DENY: No iframes allowed.\nHas anyone else dealt with a 50/100 score? What was the first \"critical\" header you fixed that actually stopped a real-world probe?\n\nTL;DR: My site is currently a playground for XSS and Session Hijacking because I’m missing basic security headers. Fixing them tonight before my API keys end up on a pastebin.",

There’s no incentive for users to use it because there’s no data to drive the experience, and there’s no incentive for locations like bars and clubs to support it in order to gather data; you’d have to convince places to trial run for you or sell the idea as an integration into an existing platform like yelp that already tracks this data, allowing you to parse and serve it for your specific needs. Or just use google to ingest their existing data, but that introduces lots of issues and bottle necks IMO.\n\nMy concept was even likely easier in the data collection arena as my data was meant to be user submitted; essentially you go to a bar and you can report to others all the relevant info like how crowded, cover amount, type of music, etc..\n\nGood luck, I hope you overcome the hurdles I ran into!",

They already have features which do this and do it immensely better than this. The fact that, by the sounds of it, you are leveraging their APIs in order to do this means you are essentially doing the same thing as them in a worse way which is going to take years of just about everyone with a smartphone downloading this before it becomes useful.\n\nI get the impression people are dunking on you for vibe-coding this and I can understand where they are coming from as there is a lot of low effort crap out there. You clearly have put the effort in but with an idea which is not going to make you money. You would need to either heavily bake adverts in (which is a red flag unless there is an absolutely killer feature buried in an ad riddled app which I do not see here) or start charging a subscription for something which is already done in better ways in market-tested free apps like Google.\n\nYou clearly have the smarts to at least get a vibe coded app to market which unlike the other crap out there is done in good faith.

Super positive response talking to people tonight. I got 18 downloads by just talking to people. People coming up to the banners. Still, there are real challenges converting but not bad. The density chicken & egg problem is real. \n\nDrop is an incredible app. I hope you all try it out. The app continues to get more and more downloads. Running on so little sleep these past few days. Got to do it all again tomorrow and just keep going. Every week. Pivoting and learning. How can we get to the finish line to get one area of density so the value is immediately clear? \n\nYou learn as you go. I am learning how to convert in person and the different challenges. Thinking of the growth methods every hour and hacks. It’s all coming along. \n\nA conversation struck me tonight as I was out. A man from the UK had rolled by my sign and stopped. He said, “this is a fantastic idea. I came out tonight but everywhere it’s so busy. I would love to know which places aren’t busy right now.” We talked for a while. It was so interesting how this app could help someone like him. He had mentioned that he’s also autistic, and knowing how busy a place is beforehand would be incredible for him. He tried to download the app but it’s only on iOS 🤣🤣. \n\nSuccess isn’t guaranteed. This will be a monumental challenge. May God be with us. I want to ask people to not leave fake reviews because they’re angry about whatever they think Drop implies. It’s hurtful to leave a review lying about the app to try and kill it. The app works. It’s been tested through hundreds of hours of real world scenarios. I went through so much to make this. I have a real family. Leaving a fake review to hurt me does hurt me. It’s evil. You can download the app and see that the app works, that the geofencing works, that it’s impressively accurate in many situations (not everyone of them) and we could talk about that if the app makes it mainstream, but come on. You’re not just hurting me. \n\nRooting for me to fail is okay, fine, but actively playing a role in it happening is pure vitriol. \n\nLet’s keep winning! This is wartime stuff. Whether Drop succeeds or not, it won’t fail because I refused to fight until the end. \n\nHoorah!",

The agent confidently generates something that passes all the gates, ships, and works fine for a week. Then you realize it solved the wrong problem. Daily security audits and mandatory test gates help, but there's no substitute for having a QA agent whose only job is asking 'but is this actually what we needed?'",

There's also chat\\_resync which defaults to 50 if an agent explicitly wants a full refresh, but that's opt-in. So basically  agents only pay for what they read. Those numbers are all configurable.\n\nThe overhead is pretty small, about 40 tokens per message for the JSON wrapper plus 30ish tokens per tool call and that gets them everything that's new since they last posted.\n\nConversations survive between sessions. Messages and images are stored in JSONL on disk and loaded on server start. You can clear it with /clear.\n\nI guess you could also generate documentation from the history by getting them to read the JSONL - haven't tried that yet!\n\nSo tl:dr if you stop everything and come back tomorrow, the full history is there.

Check that .mcp.json (for Claude/Codex) or .gemini/settings.json (for Gemini) exists in the parent directory of agentchattr (that's where the agents run from). The start scripts create these automatically, but if the agent was already running when the config was created, you'll need to restart it to pick up the new MCP server.\n\n2. Did you launch via the start scripts or manually? The start scripts (start\\_claude.sh etc.) run the wrapper, which watches for mentions and auto-injects prompts. If you started the agents manually in tmux without the wrapper, mentions won't trigger anything — the agents are running but nobody's watching for pings.\n\n3. Quick test: Kill everything, then launch fresh with sh start\\_claude.sh. It should start the server + wrapper + agent all wired together. Then go to localhost:8300 and mention an agent. You should see them respond within a few seconds.",

The interesting question at that scale: how did you handle Claude contradicting earlier architectural decisions?\n\nAt the scale we run (AI agents generating code continuously, not just a 4-day sprint), the failure mode isn't bad individual outputs — it's drift. A decision made early gets quietly undone later because the model lost context. Mandatory test-pass before any commit was the single thing that most reliably caught silent regressions.\n\nDid you do any automated validation between sessions, or was it mainly manual sanity checks? Curious whether 21k lines stayed coherent throughout or you hit a point where you had to stop and reconcile.",

In the software arena, we may see 99% failure being the norm.\n\nYet, now and then there is a single person who really knows what they are doing… has good business sense, experience, understands the numbers… just could never figure out how to get a engineering team that could do it the way they wanted.

          "text": "It's ironic that the failure rate of vibecoders is much _higher_ than the statistics collected from traditional business trends in the US, even higher than modern startups. \n\nThis is partly because things which would normally have died on the vine as \"ideas\" are being built and published. \n\nAI tools have simply removed some of the friction to putting a software based idea into the world. \n\nUnfortunately, the AI tools have NO IDEA whether your idea is good. \n\nOnly real humans can tell you that. And the best way to ask them — before building anything at all — is to do messy IRL casual Customer Discovery style learning. \n\nBut many vibecoders are specifically trying to avoid that kind of real work. They'd rather spend their dollars on LLMs and their days vibing than spend a few hours testing their assumptions with humans. \n\nIf you want to create value for humans, start with the humans, and learn how to vet your own thoughts by doing r/CustomerDiscovery. This is the beginning of the Customer Development process and r/LeanStartup methodology. This is how we find r/ProductMarketFit. \n\nAnd the latest trend to focus on \"distribution\" is a bit silly as well. It feels like a new pet word for an old fundamental that the vibers have only just discovered. Everyone seems to be looking for another shortcut to it. Distribution is being sought through tricks and tips like engineering virality. \n\nInstead, the Customer Development method reveals an emergent sales and marketing process by taking us to the humans themselves, learning how they think, feel, talk, and behave around the problem/solution space we want to enter. You can literally reverse engineer your \"distribution\" by actually talking to your customers and learning how they already behave and buy. \n\nMost vibecoders appear to have no understanding about business fundamentals. Those haven't changed! If you're just repeatedly launching projects without doing any real discovery or validation work, you're just playing lottery.\n\nThe vibecoders who win in today's market will be those who use LLMs for what they're good at, but don't try to use them as shortcuts for a variety of things they simply cannot do. \n\nLLMs cannot do customer discovery for you. They'll pretend to, but they don't know what your customers will feel, think, or do. Same with marketing and sales  stuff. If you think they can, you're being fooled by a pattern matching algo. \n\nLLMs are trained on the past. We're building the future.",

This is something that folks constantly fail to understand, and one of the signs that they’ve never really done customer discovery. Or they’ve done a quick version of it and didn’t fully understand it. \n\nProduct market fit is only one of the fits we are seeking. Or perhaps a better way to say that is that r/productmarketfit includes all of these other things, or should. While learning from real humans, we should also be deriving our marketing messaging, channel placements, narrative patterns, key words and phrases, price points, anticipated objections, indirect competitor intel, and much more.\n\nWe can and should do all of that before building anything at all. But if you’ve already built something, it’s not too late to go back and do real customer discovery work to figure out the rest. And if in the process of doing discovery and validation experiments, you discover nobody wants the thing you built, the discovery work will reveal to you something else that you should be working on instead. \n\nIf you ever feel like you are guessing about any of your sales and marketing, content or process, let it be a big red flag that you are not meaningfully connected to the people for whom you seek to create value.",

Vibe coding is relative if you have business connections, you can absolutely monetize it by rapidly prototyping something to show investors.\n\n\nHistory supports this: many highly successful figures like Gates and Zuckerberg weren't coding everything from scratch themselves; they leveraged existing code and connections to build their empires. Vibe coding operates similarly, just without the \"borrowing\" aspect. Even Elon Musk's first venture, Zip2, was reportedly a mess according to professional developers yet he sold it successfully. That's essentially vibe coding in spirit.\n\n\nThe reality is, agencies and individuals are already using this technology to accelerate development and generate revenue. Many more will follow.",

      "text": "I was working on what should have been a very simple cleanup script. The idea was to pull file references from our database and compare them with what exists in S3, then remove any redundant files.\n\nThere was some legacy behavior in the past, and as a result, we had hundreds of gigabytes of files that shouldn’t have existed in the first place. That issue had already been fixed, so I thought: great, let’s clean up the leftovers with a script.\n\nWhenever I write scripts like this, I always run a preview first. Only after the preview matches the expected changes do I run it again with --apply.\n\nThe script was basically finished.\n\nI then asked Codex, in the context of the cleanup script:\n\n“I have an idea. First, let’s run a dedupe to remove duplicate files with the same hash firstly. Then we’ll continue with the cleanup.”\n\nI was watching Codex work. Suddenly, I noticed something unexpected it created a new deduplication script and finished it very quickly. And do you know what it did next? It immediately ran the CLEANUP SCRIPT with --apply on my local test database but using LIVE S3 credentials. (Yes, my mistake I had them stored locally.) But seriously… what the hell.\n\nI killed the process as fast as I could, but it was too late. The S3 bucket went from 3 TB of user data to 34 KB.\n\nNow I have no idea how to explain this to my boss — or to the users. I guess I could just say that a bad endpoint was hacked and caused the data loss… but I know that’s not true....\n\n//EDIT: Fortunately, I had downloaded the entire S3 bucket three days earlier, and the database file references were not affected. So I asked Codex to write a script to restore the files to their correct locations in S3, since the downloaded files were not organized in the proper folder structure for some reason.\n\nI was in full panic mode, but thankfully the database was untouched and it also has backups. As long as I had the S3 files, I could reupload everything with significantly less damage than I initially feared\n\n//EDIT2: No I did not have S3 data on my PC but on other server which should do S3 backups but I did not finish it. I had other stuff to do.\n\n//EDIT3: My prompts\n\n[ https://hastebin.com/share/uwovusavit.csharp ](https://hastebin.com/share/uwovusavit.csharp)",

After an early incident where an agent removed files it shouldn't have, we added an explicit two-phase requirement: any operation touching storage or production data must first generate a manifest of what it intends to modify, then require a separate confirmation step before executing.\n\nThe key insight: you can't rely on the agent to remember to do this. The constraint has to be structural — the storage client literally can't execute deletes without a prior manifest call in the same job run. That's the only version that holds under pressure.",

          "text": "I felt my stomach drop just reading this. Glad the local backup saved you.\n\nThis is such an important lesson about AI coding agents and credentialed environments. A few things worth pulling out here:\n\nWhat actually went wrong (beyond the obvious): Codex inferred that since you'd been running the cleanup script, running it with --apply was the logical next step. It had no concept of \"preview mode exists for a reason\" - it just saw a script that needed to run and ran it. The agent completed its task perfectly. That's what makes it terrifying.\n\nFor anyone reading this: Treat AI coding agents like an eager junior dev who will do *exactly* what they think you want, not what you mean. Some concrete things that would have prevented this:\n\n* Never have live credentials accessible in the same environment where you're running/testing scripts. Separate AWS profiles, .env files that are explicitly scoped, or better yet, read-only credentials for dev work\n* Render's environment variable management ([https://render.com/docs/configure-environment-variables](https://render.com/docs/configure-environment-variables)) keeps secrets out of local environments entirely - your scripts run against the right credentials for the right environment without having prod keys sitting on your laptop\n* S3 versioning + Object Lock would have made this recoverable in minutes rather than hours of panic\n\nOn the restore script: Since you're rebuilding the folder structure from a flat backup, tools like rclone with a manifest file will be more reliable than a Codex-generated script for something this critical. Verify checksums as you go.\n\nOn telling your boss: Tell the truth. The cover story will be worse if it ever surfaces, and \"I was using an AI agent without sufficient guardrails and it ran a destructive operation with live credentials\" is actually a story most technical leaders understand right now. Come with the postmortem and what you're changing.\n\nRelieved the data exists somewhere. Good luck with the restore",

It treated that as a single workflow and ran straight through to apply without waiting for your review.\n\nIMHO, never compound destructive operations in a single prompt. \n\nBreak it into isolated, verifiable steps:\n1. “Identify all files in S3 that do not have a matching reference in the database. Write the list to orphans.md. Do not delete anything.”\n2. You review orphans.md.\n3. “Delete only the files listed in orphans.md.”\n4.

          "text": "As someone who criticises AI and vibe-coding so often, this helped me realise how far a non-coder can go using today's AI tools, and I was surprised honestly. Add to that, I developed and published many games in the past (before AI became a thing), and I admit that I'm not able to achieve such a result using Godot (I'm more into Unity3D), because most Godot-made projects I saw so far are way lower quality compared to your game.\n\nNow let's come to my feedback, as a perfectionist, here is what I noticed :\n\n* The background music transition is not well done. When you move from a menu to another there is a sharp transition. +The music that's heard in the first menu is a bit loud.\n* I had to switch to a higher quality internet connection to be able to load the game, the loading somehow breaks when using a low/mid quality internet and the game gets stuck in the \"Loading\" screen with some errors that appear in the browser console (may be a problem from [itch.io](http://itch.io) itself and not your game).\n* I liked the visual effects of attacks/magic/enemies death. I'm wondering how did you achieve such nice looking effects using AI ? did it use some ready assets or generated them from scratch ?\n* The game lacks user-experience and I don't know how and where exactly, something just feels off and makes me not feel comfortable when playing. It can be due to the quantity of content and info that falls too fast from the beginning (many stats that I don't know what are they for, many weapons that I get but don't know whether I should use or sell them, as I can't properly compare them to the existing weapons, ...). The battle feels a bit fast too. Usually games get boring because they start getting repetitive early, it was not the case for your game, which had much more content than expected, but on the other hand this made me get tired because I started to miss many important info.\n* When the squad finishes an enemy wave and move together to the right, it feels like the background moves faster than their feet animations.\n* Performance was not optimal and this is normal for an AI-generated code.\n\nDid you at any point feel that when reviewing the AI-generated code, and asking for fixes or adding more features, that the changes it made caused some flaws at some parts that you already validated before ? My experience with AI so far was bad so I wonder how did you keep things arranged with such rich project ?\n\nAlso, do you have experience as an artist that helped you polish the graphics ? This game graphics are AI-generated but for once I didn't feel a big gap between the styles (usually AI-generated images are a mix of realistic, toony, 3D, ... styles)\n\nAnd one last question, how much $ did you pay overall for the AI usage making this game ?",

My experience with AI so far was bad so I wonder how did you keep things arranged with such rich project ?\n\nNot OP but I do a ton of \"vibe coding.\" I don't know when the last time you tried was, but the tools, especially Claude Code, have come a VERY long way in this regard, even just over the past 3 months. Especially so if you go through an extensive planning phase before beginning any major feature or the before you start on the project as a whole.\n\nI personally bounce the plan back and forth between claude (opus) and chatgpt/codex. Chatgpt kinda sucks at the initial plan but is FANTASTIC at poking holes in things and showing you all the ambiguities and unanswered questions about your existing plan. So make a plan with Claude, give the initial plan to chatgpt and ask for open questions, ambiguities, and to tell you anything it would change about the plan. Then you answer all the open questions and give that plus any additional feedback back to Claude, repeat 2 or 3 times depending on the size and scale of the project, and you end up with an iron-clad planning document that leaves very little room for the agents to improvise and start fucking stuff up.\n\nSo nail down the architecture and how every important function will work before you start, tell it the plan should be in manageable phases and then you tackle it phase-by-phase. Your main AI window will act as an orchestrator and the actual coding will be done with individual subagents who are told EXACTLY what to make and what the acceptance criteria are for each task. When possible, this will happen with parallel subagents working simultaneously on different aspects of the code, so the speed at which you can get this done is pretty insane. Then when each phase is done, you test and fine tune everything.\n\nAlso having it run a separate agent to perform a code review every time a coding agent is finished will catch breaking changes 90%+ of the time it still happens, and fix it before you even test and see it fail in action. This code review can happen automatically as a required part of the coding process if you save it as the development flow in your CLAUDE.md file which is basically like the rules for AI to follow when working on the project.",

I agree with you on the music and the combat feeling a little too fast to understand whats going on and there's a lot more work to be done to optimise the performance. I'll try to address your questions:  \n\\- For the VFX, I used some VFX spritesheets that I bought from [itch.io](http://itch.io) and also vibe coded some shader effects. the vibe coded shader effects are not great TBH, I think AI models don't make great shaders at the momeent.   \n\\- This may sound crazy, but I don't code so I don't review the code. I have to trust the model to make the best choices and do ocassional refactors to keep things sane, but I am pretty sure the code is messy.   \n\\- In the past 3-4 months, since Opus 4.5 came out, I am seeing very little regression in terms of the game as I add more gameplay features and content to the game. I think the models are getting better at understanding large codebases and not screwing things up when building new features.  \n\\- I am a Designer by profession and I do make art from time to time, so I am very familiar with tools like Photoshop and Figma, which helps a lot when I am cleaning up visuals and desinging UIs.  \n\\- I think this project costs about $1k+ in terms of tokens usage so far.",

                  "text": "In standard English, **feedback** is an **uncountable noun** (also known as a mass noun). Here is why that correction is grammatically necessary:\n\n### 1. Uncountable Nouns\n\nUnlike countable nouns (like \"app\" or \"developer\"), uncountable nouns represent a concept or a mass that isn't typically counted individually.\n\n* **Correct:** \"I received much feedback.\"\n* **Incorrect:** \"I received many feedbacks.\"\n\nEven if you receive fifty different comments from fifty different people, it is still collectively referred to as \"feedback,\" not \"feedbacks.\"\n\n### 2. How to Count Feedback\n\nIf you need to refer to specific, individual instances of feedback, you have to use a **\"counter\"** or a different phrasing. Common ways to do this include:\n\n* \"698 **pieces of** feedback.\"\n* \"698 **responses** given.\"\n* \"698 **comments** provided.\"\n\n### 3. Comparison with Other Metrics\n\nLooking at the other cards in the image helps illustrate the difference:\n\n| Type | Term | Plural Form? | Example from Image |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Countable** | Devs | Yes | \"1101 Indie Devs\" |\n| **Countable** | Apps | Yes | \"203 Apps Uploaded\" |\n| **Uncountable** | Feedback | **No** | \"698 Feedback Given\" |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The letter \"s\" was crossed out because \"feedback\" is already plural in essence; adding an \"s\" is a grammatical redundancy that doesn't exist in standard English.\n",

Every user can see every other user's data. Nobody catches this in testing because you're the only user.\n\nPayments go through on the happy path. But failed payments, cancelled subscriptions, webhook failures? None of that is handled. Stripe sends an event, nobody's listening.\n\nThe database is flat. Everything stuffed into one table. Works with 10 test records. Falls apart at 500 real users.\n\nDuplicate logic everywhere. You asked the AI to add a feature, forgot you already asked last week, now two workflows fire on every action.\n\nNo error handling. When something breaks the user sees a white screen or nothing happens. No fallback, no message, no logging.\n\nVibe coding is great for getting to 80%. That last 20% is where the app actually becomes a product. If you're planning to charge real money, get someone technical to review before you launch.",

Who cares if you need to start from scratch after round 1 funding if you only sunk a couple hours into a project?\n\nI worked for a think tank that went into start ups to fix problems for them and I saw dozens of real codebases on startups, pre-AI. They all were made by coders who quit their jobs to work on it for six months, barely scraping by to get something out. Because of the massive time restraints, the codebases were shit nearly every time.  They spent the first year after funding basically refactoring everything to make it scalable.\n\nFor a programmer who knows the full stack moderately well, AI is a viable option for getting a quick release, getting bought out by a bigger entity or funded and then rebuilding everything more scalable once you can afford a couple employees who are experts in specific fields.\n\nIf you have no idea how to code it the first place, it's a lot more risky because you may end up with liabilities between release and funding that kill your business entirely.",

          "text": "I must say this is awesome, didn't expect to install a VS Code extension today and immediately feel like my agents have \\*personalities\\* now, but here we are.\n\nThe idle timer heuristic for detecting user-input state is a tricky one — I was thinking, could you hook into the VS Code terminal data events? The terminal API fires events when data is written to the terminal surface, so you might be able to detect the prompt character rendering as a signal. Might be noisy but worth poking at.\n\nThe thing I'm most excited about is honestly the Desks as Directories concept. Right now multi-agent work feels kind of invisible — you don't really \"see\" the parallelism happening. Having a spatial metaphor for it could make it way more legible, especially when you're coordinating 4-5 agents at once.\n\nOne wild idea: what if the office had a \"bulletin board\" area that showed a live summary of what each agent last completed? Like a little async update wall. Could make for a fun ambient awareness thing without having to context-switch into each terminal.\n\nAnyway, PRing some CC0 furniture assets sounds like a fun weekend project — I'll check out the repo. This is a genuinely cool direction.",

Keep it clean and fast.\"\n\nIt spat out a solid starting point in like 10-15 mins – tables, forms, basic auth. I tweaked a couple validation bits with some quick JS, self-hosted it on our server for privacy, and boom. Team started using it daily, no more Slack pings for \"where's the status on X client?\"\n\nNot the flashiest thing ever, but it actually solved real pain and felt like pure vibe coding win – describe idea, get working app, iterate lightly. Still running strong. What's yours? Share the links!",

Not saying that them being professionals automatically makes them correct but still, I'd inherently trust their opinion more than an AI's\n\nThat being said, some stuff it mentioned was stuff that I did probably need to hear so there's some value in that. I just think it would be good to have the option to ask for actionable steps to improve\n\nFor reference, I uploaded a screenshot of the landing page for my website. It has a blurred out showreel background, my logo (was expecting that to be roasted the most cause it's awful lol) and some very basic information of some softwares I know. The software skills are displayed as little skill cards with my most proficient skill having a little star next to it. \n\nThe bulk of the feedback was about how I showcase too many skills rather than highlighting being good at one or a few of them. I'd definitely agree that this is something I should change but I found myself wanting to ask if it would be a good idea to colour code the skills, showing a range from most confident to somewhat confident or if I should get rid of some of them all together",

If people use your app and the app in turn uses these services, will it count towards your credits? Will the app stop working for all users when too many free (or paid for that matter) calls have been made to Gemini? Or I guess in this case the paid service would make you enough to cover that.

Think of it like a Soundcloud player but purpose-built for comparing audio.\n\nV1 was built the traditional way with a hired developer. Worked, had paying subscribers, but was limited. Rebuilt the whole thing as v2 using Base44 for the app framework and Claude for everything else: planning, architecture, debugging, legal docs, you name it.\n\nV2 has embeddable players with full style customization, video sync mode, playlist support, portfolio pages, Stripe billing, and a media library with S3 storage. About to open it up for beta testing.\n\nBiggest lesson: vibe coding isn't just for prototypes. You can ship real products with real users this way.

There's still a million problems but hey, that's a website.  Trying to get anything to \"show up right\" on pc, tablet, and mobile views (all of which need their own code) is no simple task.  \n\nMy workflow has gotten better though, the model understands what I want more, and it's starting to become a battle of trying to pump out articles everyday (it takes about 50 before google even pays attention to you) is hard work even with the a.i.  Anyway, I'm proud of what I've built so far.  Everyday is a new challenge.\n\n[https://kamikazeearth.blogspot.com/](https://kamikazeearth.blogspot.com/)",

Building that quality filter was harder than building any single feature — it's easy to make AI create things, hard to make it recognize when to throw them away.\n\nultrathink.art if you want to see what a real AI-operated business looks like.",

I built a platform to process the audio (or video if necessary) through DeepGram for transcription creation. It then takes the transcript and parses it to Gemini 3 Flash's Content Generation API to build more of a theological essay from the sermon. It also produces more of a 1:1, but formatted, version of the sermon. Finally, it indexes references to scripture, which gives a very nice drill-down of 'every time X has been referenced or taught on'. This is, by far, what I'm most proud of so far from a vibe-coding perspective.",
