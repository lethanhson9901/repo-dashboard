AND you only need to use them for the one-off cases.. not consistently, so it doesn't cost much in the end.\n\nAnd of course! Thanks for checking it out! ",

      "text": "I’m a software engineer, and like so many of us, my company is pushing hard for us to leverage AI agents to \"multiply output.\"\n\nFor the last two years, I used AI like a glorified Stack Overflow: debugging, writing boilerplate unit tests, or summarizing unfamiliar methods. But recently, we were tasked with a \"top-down\" AI-driven project. We had to use agents as much as humanly possible to build a substantial feature.\n\nI just finished a 14K Lines of Code implementation in C# .NET 8. After a few horrific failures, I’ve realized that the media’s version of \"everyone is a dev now\" is absolute BS.\n\n**The \"Vibe Coding\" Trap** The \"Vibe Coding\" trend suggests you can just prompt your way to a product. Sure, you can do that for a Todo app or a Tic-Tac-Toe game. But for a robust, internal tool with dozens interacting classes? **Vibing is a recipe for disaster.**\n\nThe second an AI agent is allowed to make an assumption—the second you stop guardrailing its architectural choices—it starts to break things. It introduces \"hallucinated\" patterns that don't match company standards, ignores edge cases, and builds a \"Frankenstein\" codebase that looks okay on the outside but is a nightmare of technical debt on the inside.\n\n**How I actually got it to work: The \"Architect-First\" Method** To get production-grade results, I couldn't just \"prompt.\" I had to act as a Principal Architect and a Drill Sergeant. My workflow looked like this:\n\n1. **The 2,000-Line Blueprint:** Before a single line of code was written, I used the AI to help me formalize a massive, detailed implementation plan. We’re talking specific design patterns (Flyweight, Scoped State), naming conventions, and exact technology stacks.\n2. **Modular TDD:** I broke the project into small, testable phases. We wrote the tests *first*. If the agent couldn't make the test pass, it meant my specification was too vague.\n3. **The \"DoD\" Gate:** I implemented a strict **Definition of Done (DoD)** for every sub-task. [E.gl](http://E.gl) If the AI didn't include industry-leading XML documentation (explaining the \"Why,\" not just the \"What\") or if it violated a SOLID principle, the task was rejected.\n\n**The Reality Check** AI is an incredible power tool, but it doesn't replace the need to know what you’re doing. In fact, **you have to be a better architect to use AI successfully at scale.** You have to define:\n\n* What coding principles to follow.\n* Which design patterns to implement.\n* How memory should be managed (e.g., using `Span<T>` or `Memory<T>` for performance).\n* How to prevent race conditions in concurrent loops.\n\nIf you don't know these things, you aren't \"coding,\" you're just generating future outages.\n\nAI doesn't make \"everyone a dev.\" It makes the Senior Developer an Orchestrator. If you don't put in the hours for planning, specification, and rigid guardrailing, the AI will just help you build a bigger mess, faster.",

You have to think about every edge case, every interaction between components, every naming convention upfront. The irony is that the skill that makes you effective at AI-assisted development is the exact same skill that made senior engineers valuable before AI: the ability to break down ambiguous requirements into precise, testable specifications.\n\n  \nThe one addition I'd make to your workflow: version your specs alongside your code.

You are proving my point exactly. In the right hands, AI agents are incredible tools—they can even build something as complex as a Linux kernel. However, I am certain those agents were provided with thousands of lines of context in markdown files, detailing exactly what needed to be done. Those files were created by highly experienced developers. If you gave 16 Opus 4.6 agents to someone who doesn't understand how a kernel functions or what to look out for, it would be a disaster. Even as a developer, I couldn't write a Linux kernel without extensive research.

Yes, you need to have a good understanding of software enginnering principles to make it work for less-than-trivial apps. **For now**.\n\nBut as the capabilities of models are still evolving, probably this won't last for long either. \n\nThe thing is that the software development process consists of several layers of understanding/knowledge and thus activities that are sometimes done by different people (in large projects) with different skills (though these people may have worked in other roles earlier). At one end, we have the users/stakeholders who don't (necessarily) know much about the whole process and can't formulate the requirements, but have an understanding of what they want (not necessarily what they need). At the other end is the completed, working software.\n\nNow AI seems to be able to do more and more of this process, starting from the bottom, i.e. from the side of the code. At first it was \"just glorified autocomplete\", and it gradually was able to create more and more on its own meaning it can work with (understand, if you will) higher level, more abstract concepts that are more removed/farther away from the code that **it** needs to create in the end. \n\nFor now, you'll want an architect/senior engineer/tech lead to drive it (or, at least to lead the project) for best results. Maybe we can start calling it something else, just like we dropped the \"prompt engineering\" term, but it doesn't matter. It's really AI-assisted software creation where AI does more and more of the task. At one point (we don't know when) it will be able to just talk to the users, extract the requirements from them by asking questions, explaining tradeoffs (though there will be less reason for tradeoffs probably), etc.\n\nThough as we'll approach this level, we'll probably need less software, less software of the kind that we have been creating in the past because people will have to do less with computers anyway. (E.g. we'll probably need less complex accounting software as we'll need less accountants doing less low-level tasks related to accounting and rely more on AI.)",

It's definitely not one-shot and trust the AI to do everything. It's more like let the AI explain itself, consider if it makes sense for what I need, and then explore other solutions if it doesn't make sense or work.

I arrived at the exact same conclusion from a completely different industry.\n\nI'm an ECU engineer — 15 years designing traction control and quickshift systems for motorcycles. I don't write production code. I write specifications and control logic, then hand them off to in-house implementation teams or software engineers at external ECU manufacturers. Every handoff has a structured document. Every boundary has a verification gate. It's called the V-model, and it exists because in safety-critical systems, \"just vibe it\" kills people.\n\nWhen I started using AI agents for software projects, I instinctively applied the same discipline. Separate the design phase from the implementation phase. Never let the agent decide architecture — that's your job. And never trust \"Done!\" without independent verification.\n\nYour \"2,000-Line Blueprint\" is exactly what we call a design specification in automotive. Your \"DoD Gate\" is our control review. Your \"Modular TDD\" maps to our verification phases. You reinvented the V-model from first principles, and that's not a coincidence — it's because the problem is the same: AI agents, like junior engineers, need guardrails to go fast safely.\n\nThe one thing I'd add: separate \"investigate\" from \"fix.\" When something breaks, don't let the agent patch it immediately. Make it diagnose first, report findings, then you decide the fix. Skipping this is how you end up in what I call \"Shallow Fix Swamp\" — each quick patch creates the next failure.\n\nI think of AI agents like Tamiya Mini 4WD cars (know them? Every Japanese engineer grew up racing these things!). They can only go straight — they literally need guardrails to turn corners. Run them in an open field and they just take off and leave you behind. lol",

I see those comics talking about, \"what does a product designer do when the marketplace has infinite similar options?\" and yeah, it's a big deal. \n\nIt may sound pedantic but I kind of lucked into my current job, but I am able to keep the job because I am building custom software for the company and....the answer to that question is, you don't buy what's on the marketplace anymore. It's becoming so, so freaking easy to make software for yourself, that for like enterprise and corporate software, a lot of it you should just build yourself now. \n\nLike, Apple uses SAP for their manufacturing software. I can't imagine how expensive that contract with SAP is. But with AI driven software dev, they honestly could get rid of it by now. They could make their own custom ERP (SAP style software) and save that money. \n\nSo yeah, if you make this kind of software and put a price tag on it, maybe don't rely on it for your income. And if you're SAP, then I feel like you need to be doing summersaults for your customers offering custom solutions for them, or like an AI dashboard a customer can use to customize their SAP experience, idk. And also maybe there are some customers who don't want to make anything themselves, are okay paying the SAP price, etc, and maybe some customers exist for this weather app. But yeah. That's my two cents. ",

I excitedly downloaded it expecting to see a nice iso of Atlanta, GA which is where I live and a somewhat major city(not as big as NYC I guess), and honestly it just felt like futuristic city slop :(\n\nNot exactly sure on your generation process, but you could have it pick specific iconic buildings and maybe even fetch images of those buildings to get more accurate results in the final generation(I understand that can add to the cost, but if you want that “magic” and personalized feeling over the slop feeling you kinda need that).\n\nI was hoping to see the pencil building, the Mercedes Benz stadium, maybe Georgia aquarium(I know a couple of those buildings “are” there but I really don’t count those because they honestly look nothing like the pencil building or the Georgia aquarium really do so I think the reference images are necessary)\n\nI was also thinking that seeing things like world of coke or brands associated with Atlanta,\n\nOr maybe things associated with culture in Atlanta like incorporating rap artists somehow in the design.\n\nThere are a lot of directions you could go, but I think in its current state I felt disappointed and it feels like slop, but I’d recommend you figure out a generation pipeline that can encode that specific city personalization better likely through reference images automatically fetched based on cities and search.\n\nReally cool idea I love the isometric style in general!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yhxxocpw1qig1.jpeg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d106fd2081dad1f3d0bf4180392d1cb8b34d4ccb",

The stack choice is smart, sticking with what you already know well and letting AI handle the areas where you're weaker (React admin panel) is exactly the right approach.\n\nThat's honestly the part of vibe coding that doesn't get discussed enough. It's not about AI replacing your skills, it's about AI filling the gaps so you can move at full speed across the entire stack instead of slowing down every time you hit an unfamiliar layer.\n\nWe've shipped a bunch of MVPs using a similar approach: strong foundation in the areas we know, AI acceleration everywhere else. The projects that go well are always the ones where the developer has enough experience to evaluate what the AI generates and course-correct quickly. The ones that struggle are when someone relies on AI for areas they can't QA themselves.\n\nCurious about your experience with Codex CLI vs Claude CLI. Did you find one was better for certain types of tasks, or was it mostly preference?",

Widget: I use the iOS weather widget and what I like is that I see how warm/cold it gets today. I always check before leaving the house to know what I should be wearing (the span can be big). You widget looks much better but don't have this information (I like the wind info though)  \n2. Sometimes high/low is not enough and I want to know if it's raining etc. Once I click the iOS widget I can see in compact overview how the weather develops throughout the day and I even get a glimpse what it looks next days. In your app I would need to do extra clicks. Merge 'now' and '3 days' screen?   \n3. The 3-Days screen looks overwhelming and needs some polishing. You can shorten information, e.g. \"06-12\" -> \"6\" (again see how apple indicates clock time, imo much better). Also on my screen the wind data is truncated by \"...\" making it pointless here.\n\nNevertheless, again, congrats, will try it out the next days!",

Just learned about it today, I’ve been a developer for a long time but I’m about to buy a MacBook and figured why not give IOS development a try (MacBook because of how annoying safari CSS issues are to fix on windows/linux, tired of the workarounds)\n\nIt really is crazy to me how rapidly ai based development has grown, I remember ChatGPT being laughable, to now me having ai do 95%+ of my coding. \n\nI’ve been able to take on a lot more custom software jobs for companies due to this, but have had my eyes on app development for a more passive stream of revenue. Any tips/heads up for native apps?",

The fact that you got App Store approval quickly and are already generating revenue shows you're onto something.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Some thoughts on scaling to that 1M goal:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Track what's working\\*\\* - Which marketing channels brought those first customers? Double down on what's converting.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Customer feedback loop\\*\\* - Those early users are gold. Talk to them, understand why they paid, what problem you solved. This will help you position for growth.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*ASO (App Store Optimization)\\*\\* - With some revenue, you can now invest in improving your app store listing, screenshots, description. This can significantly boost organic downloads.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Consider freemium or subscription\\*\\* - One-time purchases are great, but recurring revenue makes scaling more predictable. Maybe a free tier with premium features?\n\n\n\n5. \\*\\*Community building\\*\\* - Start building in public on Twitter/LinkedIn. Share your journey, your wins, your learnings. It creates momentum and attracts customers.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Technical question:\\*\\* What's your tech stack? Did you use any specific AI coding assistants or frameworks that helped speed up development? Always curious to learn from other vibe coders.\n\n\n\nCongrats on the early traction! The journey from $65 to 1M starts with that first sale. Keep shipping! 👏",

They either had a template ready, skipped error handling, or the \"app\" is a single screen with no real logic.\n\n  \nThat said, your approach of writing detailed specs first is actually the right one. The trick is to not write ALL the specs upfront. Break it into tiny slices: get one screen working end to end, then iterate. The AI is much better at extending something that works than building from a giant spec all at once.\n\n  \nAlso since you mentioned trying Codex first, give Claude Code a shot too. For mobile UI work specifically I have found it does a better job of maintaining design consistency across screens. The key is giving it one screen at a time rather than the whole app.\n\n  \nYour dev experience is actually an advantage here, not a disadvantage. You know what questions to ask and what corners not to cut. The people building in 2 hours are shipping stuff that breaks the moment a real user touches it.",

If you're making an app that just calculates something and doesn't have user accounts, you can absolutely use a powerful llm like Claude Code on Opus to rip out a mobile app in two hours. Once you start adding complex features, you start needing security layers and it starts taking planning the architecture, etc...\n\nMany also are selling the same product to multiple businesses, so they might have templates and resource documents for the llm that are pre-prepared, which can drop development time a ton.\n\nIt also takes learning the tools to get fast with them. Your software development background will be an asset in the long run, but you need to make some concessions when vibe coding. In vibe coding, it is often better to implement an automated testing system and use that to check off that something is working, rather than try to keep up with the speed it's generating code and reading through it all. It's kind of like when compilers came out for compiling higher languages into lower languages the first time. Programmers at the time were obsessed with going through what the compiler was putting out and complaining that it didn't allocate memory in just the way they intended. The reality though was that as computers increased in power and compilers improved, that became irrelevant. The software still worked and that was the end goal.",

Without vibing I’d probably just be getting ready to reach MVP after 8-9 months but with vibe coding I’m much further beyond mvp very huge project but no way I was going to do it in two hours for sure. If i did I’d be lying to say it’s secured or production ready in 2 hours… I think vibe coders have great ideas because they think as a end user as opposed to a dev just focused on quality code ya know but good idea no skill to implement is just a idea.

Then I ask it to embody an competing persona, a Principal software engineer and challenge the theories. If nobody is coming up with a clear winning hypothesis I ask them to figure out how differential diagnosis can be applied to narrow down the potential root causes and get positive confirmation (basically log the shit out of everything, deploy the logging and then work through the error messages as new info to find the true failure point). I tell it search online for standardized error messages from supabase or vercel for example, but everything will have standardized errors. \n\nOf course I recruit stronger models when it doesn't look like the AI agent is managing to figure it out. I also try to read through the \"thinking\" if it looks like they're getting farther off base, but that only helps when they're obviously off the rails.\n\nAny advice on improving this methodology?",

It's impressive, but as a skeptical engineer, I wanted to check the code quality under the hood.\nI picked 5 random open-source repositories from GitHub that were clearly AI-generated (tagged \"built with Lovable\" or \"Cursor-generated\").\nThe Result: 5/5 failed a basic security audit.\nThe \"Silent Killer\" Bug:\nThe most common issue wasn't a complex hack. It was a simple configuration error that AI models make constantly because they prioritize \"making it work\" over \"locking it down.\"\nSpecifically, I found Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies that looked like this:\n\n\n-- The \"I'll fix it later\" policy\nCREATE POLICY \"Enable read access for all users\"\nON \"public\".\"users\"\nFOR SELECT\nUSING (true);\n\nWhat this means:\nThe AI wrote this so the frontend wouldn't throw permission errors during the demo. But in production, this line means anyone (even unauthenticated visitors) can run a SELECT * on your User table and dump emails, hashed passwords, and profile data. I was able to pull the entire customer list from one of these \"launched\" startups in about 3 seconds.\n\nThe Problem:\nAI is great at writing code that functions. It is terrible at writing code that is secure. It doesn't know context. It just wants to clear the error message.\n\nThe Offer:\nI'm tweaking my internal audit checklist for this. If you built your MVP with AI (Cursor/v0/Lovable) and want a sanity check:\n\nDrop your GitHub repo link (or DM me).\n\nI'll run a quick audit on your schema.sql, API routes, and Client components to see if you're leaking data. No charge, just testing my own detection rules against real-world mess.\n\n\nEdit: Please only send public repos or specific snippets if you're worried about privacy.\n\nEDIT: The queue for free audits is now open at vibescan dot site. I'm processing these in batches today.",

I think having a file which contains the checklist and ask the coding agent to do periodic review and report, and log the audit result + actions taken would go a long way. Codex at least is capable of finding and fixing problems, but you have to prompt it. My guess is the training data contains a lot of badly made code base (if they used public repos to train, then I understand), so it doesn't default to good practices.\n\nCodex at least likes to: add dependencies without notifying, inline/runtime schema changes, add variables and flags without notifying, and skip certain part of instructions if it think it is too complex (it will choose the shortcut regardless of whether wise to do so). Lastly, and this is the killer, it doesn't like to verify the code when asked about existing functions and likes to guess what the code \"would\" do. So if you are in tune with the nuances in Codex's responses, you might think your code has security features where it does not. I run into this a lot, so I have to ask it to point to the code for mission critical assessments. But if you are a true viber and can't read the code it does. you no good, and you have to rely on agent's assessment which is very unreliable.",

Given that i wouldn’t recommend lovable, you need tanstack query or nextjs for implementing solid frontend and always revise the response data to make sure ur not just sending user passwords by mistake",

The pattern I keep seeing is the AI writing the happy path perfectly but leaving auth checks, input validation, and error boundaries as an afterthought.\n\n  \nWhat helped me was adding explicit security rules to my [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) that the agent reads every session. Things like never expose user data without auth middleware, always validate at API boundaries, never trust client input. It sounds obvious written out but the AI genuinely needs these spelled out or it will take the shortest path to clearing the error.\n\n  \nThe RLS thing is so common because the AI gets a permission error, sees USING (true) fixes it, and moves on. It has zero concept of what that policy actually means in production. Same pattern with CORS set to wildcard, API keys in client bundles, .env files committed to git, etc.\n\n  \nYour offer to audit repos is genuinely useful. More people need to hear this before they ship to real users.",

I've seen Claude Code do the same thing with CORS — it'll set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` to clear an error during development and never revisit it.
