Simply nailing down the product requirements, writing (or reviewing) a technical design doc, requiring the agent to add and run tests with each commit, and reviewing PRs will make the agents' output a lot more sensible. Use them as very diligent, somewhat competent, but very forgetful junior engineers and you will not be disappointed.\n\nAlternatively, after you have requirements, you can write a ton of tests against the API layer, use those tests to programmatically identify dead backend code and remove it, then break out one chunk of endpoints at a time and re-write them in new modules.  Then you can write a new frontend, starting with a proper API client and then going screen-by-screen - you may be able to parallelize this somewhat with another developer, but expect to uncover inconsistencies in the API as you go.\n\nBut that's how I've gone about refactoring a project that was shipped to users, where you have to take care not to break anything at every step.  If nothing has shipped yet, you have the freedom of starting over and can get there faster.",

Also write tests first. It might help just splitting the big file up into independent endpoints first, without changing any logic.

Even if you give it some capabilities via MCP this minimal task I have where it fails still occurs as its not a good for for AI.\n\nA hybrid approach is probably better.

Before touching anything, add basic integration tests for the main flows. Use the app as a black box and test the API endpoints. This is your safety net.\n\n  \n2. Start extracting one route group at a time into separate files. Pick the simplest one first. Keep the original file as the router that imports from the new modules.\n\n  \n3. Use Claude Code or similar to help with the mechanical refactoring. Paste chunks of the 30K file and ask it to identify logical groupings and extract them. The AI can handle tedious extraction work pretty well.\n\n  \nFor the frontend UI/UX mess:\n\n  \n1. Create a simple style guide first, even just 5-6 rules: primary color, font stack, button styles, spacing scale. Apply these globally via CSS variables.\n\n  \n2. Pick one component pattern (cards, forms, whatever is most common) and make it consistent everywhere. Then move to the next pattern.\n\n  \n3. Do NOT try to redesign everything at once. Consistency beats perfection when cleaning up.\n\n  \nThe key is incremental improvement with tests protecting you. Your boss created technical debt but its not unfixable. Just chip away at it.",

It felt great until we got past maybe 100–150 users and the pricing started to sting for what was basically “nice UI on top of a table”.\n\nI tried Glide and Stacker as alternatives. Both are solid, but once you count lots of external users the numbers were not that different in the long run. In the end I stopped thinking in terms of “portal builder” and moved to a normal database plus an app builder on top.\n\nFor me that ended up being UIBakery on top of Postgres. I am not from their team or anything, it just fit better. External users only see their own rows, auth is handled once, and the pricing felt saner than paying per head for every customer who logs in twice a month. It took a bit more setup than Softr on day one, but I am much less stressed about the bill now.\n\nBig question is really your monthly budget and how technical you are willing to get. If you want to stay very low effort, Glide or Stacker might be easier. If you are ok touching a DB or getting some help, something like UI Bakery on top of Airtable or a proper DB can be a nice middle ground.",

Without that breathing room this turns into constant firefighting instead of real cleanup.\n\nThen I’d approach it in a structured, iterative way, in small steps:\n\n1. Stabilize the current state Make sure builds and runtime are reproducible and that it’s clear what currently works. Put very lightweight safeguards around the most important flows so you notice quickly if something breaks during refactoring.\n2. Make the structure visible Group the existing code into logically related functional areas and get a rough understanding of how they interact. At this stage it’s about creating clarity, not changing behavior.\n3. Modularize before optimizing Gradually move toward smaller, more clearly bounded modules without altering functionality. The goal here is readability and maneuverability, not “clean code” yet.\n4. Incremental simplification Once the structure holds, start reducing duplication, clarifying responsibilities, and making boundaries more explicit. It’s normal to go through multiple passes before things feel right.\n5. Bring UI/UX into a consistent shape No big redesign. Define a small set of layout and styling rules and apply them consistently over time. Consistency matters more than perfection here.\n\nAI can help a lot with the mechanical parts (splitting code, restructuring, repetitive changes), but it can’t make the judgment calls around boundaries, priorities, and acceptance criteria for you.\n\nThis only works if time is intentionally allocated for it. You’re being paid to do this and you’ll learn a lot about refactoring and system understanding, but without clear expectations and space, it quickly becomes your personal problem instead of a structural one.",

Code was bloated and full of dependencies and broken functionality due to years of neglect and oversight. (Node 8, we pack, react/angular mix).\n\nKeep the vanilla JS and CSS.

The system was built without anyone ever deciding what was in charge, what was allowed to change, and what absolutely shouldn’t. Once features start shipping faster than understanding, entropy wins every time.\n\nOn the UI/UX specifically, the trap is trying to “fix” it globally. If you touch everything at once, you’ll never finish. The only sane move is to pick one thin vertical slice that actually matters to users, define what “correct” looks like there, and enforce consistency only inside that boundary. Treat everything else as radioactive until proven otherwise.\n\nMore broadly, don’t try to refactor this into a good system straight away. First goal is to make it legible. Break the giant API file only if you can explain why each new boundary exists. If you can’t explain it, Cursor won’t be able to maintain it either.\n\nYou’re basically inheriting a product that worked by momentum, not structure. The fastest way out isn’t cleaning up the slop, it’s stopping the bleeding and forcing a single source of truth back into the system.\n\nIt’s rough work, but you’re asking the right question.",

After that there's basically never a need again.\n\nThose are just good starter suggestions in my opinion. I find a lot more value in software-specific MCPs that provide value ongoing.. for example:\n\n\\- Figma MCP - I build very detailed UI/UX mockups and it will inspect every single element and recreate it almost identically while giving it functionality\n\n\\- Stripe MCP - I don't even have to create the products, connect the APIs, or handle any of the payment processing connections in my project\n\n\\- Vercel MCP - with the right details and context, I can have my entire hosting and server set up handled entirely for me without doing any of it manually\n\n\\- Firebase/Supabase MCP - (will often still need a slight manual touch) this typically handles 90% - 98% of the backend set up, connections, db structure\n\nThese are some examples of the more useful MCPs.. AND you only need to use them for the one-off cases.. not consistently, so it doesn't cost much in the end.\n\nAnd of course! Thanks for checking it out! ",

They either had a template ready, skipped error handling, or the \"app\" is a single screen with no real logic.\n\n  \nThat said, your approach of writing detailed specs first is actually the right one. The trick is to not write ALL the specs upfront. Break it into tiny slices: get one screen working end to end, then iterate. The AI is much better at extending something that works than building from a giant spec all at once.\n\n  \nAlso since you mentioned trying Codex first, give Claude Code a shot too. For mobile UI work specifically I have found it does a better job of maintaining design consistency across screens. The key is giving it one screen at a time rather than the whole app.\n\n  \nYour dev experience is actually an advantage here, not a disadvantage. You know what questions to ask and what corners not to cut. The people building in 2 hours are shipping stuff that breaks the moment a real user touches it.",

They have a localhost demo that crashes when you enter unexpected input.\n\nWhat I've found: the experienced developers who are thoughtful about requirements *up front* actually ship faster in the end because they don't hit the 'generated code house of cards' collapse at hour 6. You're doing it right — the prompt doc IS the product spec, and it's worth getting it right before you let the AI loose.",

The actual fix required reading the platform docs and understanding scroll-snap behavior, not asking the AI to try again. That's the gap nobody talks about — AI is great at generating code, terrible at diagnosing why something doesn't work on a specific platform.\n\nThe spec/requirements work you're doing upfront is genuinely the right approach.

Your software development background will be an asset in the long run, but you need to make some concessions when vibe coding. In vibe coding, it is often better to implement an automated testing system and use that to check off that something is working, rather than try to keep up with the speed it's generating code and reading through it all. It's kind of like when compilers came out for compiling higher languages into lower languages the first time. Programmers at the time were obsessed with going through what the compiler was putting out and complaining that it didn't allocate memory in just the way they intended. The reality though was that as computers increased in power and compilers improved, that became irrelevant. The software still worked and that was the end goal.",

So what I’m saying vibe code shaved 6-12 months of dev but when doing it the right way it still took 8-9 months to complete it and of course it’s ongoing so if you are a experienced developer then a real project will and still should take a good amount of time even if you worked it full time. Without vibing I’d probably just be getting ready to reach MVP after 8-9 months but with vibe coding I’m much further beyond mvp very huge project but no way I was going to do it in two hours for sure. If i did I’d be lying to say it’s secured or production ready in 2 hours… I think vibe coders have great ideas because they think as a end user as opposed to a dev just focused on quality code ya know but good idea no skill to implement is just a idea. With skills and no idea you are just building…",

Keep a [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) file in the root with your project context, conventions, and architecture decisions. Every time you come back to add features, Claude picks up where you left off instead of reinventing patterns.\n\n  \n2. Break changes into small PRs. Vibe coding makes it tempting to do huge refactors but that is where things fall apart. Small incremental changes are way easier to debug when something breaks.\n\n  \n3. Use git branches for experiments. Let Claude try wild ideas on a branch, test it, then merge or toss it.\n\n  \n4. For debugging, feeding Claude the error plus relevant context works better than just pasting the stack trace. Give it the function, the test that failed, and what you expected.\n\n  \nThe real insight: maintainability with AI coding is less about the code quality and more about YOUR understanding of the architecture. If you know how the pieces fit, you can always fix things. If you let the AI go wild without understanding what it built, you're toast.\n\n  \nSpeed vs maintainability? I optimize for understanding. Slower upfront but way faster at month 6.",

The architecture is important, Starting on [Lovable.dev](http://Lovable.dev) meant inheriting a React + TypeScript frontend built with Vite, which is primarily client-side rendered. That setup is not ideal for SEO, so I had to introduce server-side rendering selectively to compensate. If I just started with a Next.js app, that already has SSR which is better for SEO. I don't have any issues maintaining it, I've had to rebuild some sections like all the RSS parsing and categorization, agent editorial management but with new models and services, you're going to be rebuilding things regularly. I know one startup that rearchitects and rebuilds almost every 6 months.",

Everyone talks about how easy it is now with Claude Code, Antigravity etc.., but they leave out the part where you get completely fucked by production issues that AI can't solve.\n\nPure AI coding gets you maybe 60% there. You can build nice landing pages, set up login systems, even get a decent dashboard running. But then real subscribers start using your product and everything breaks in ways the AI never warned you about.\n\nLemonsqueezy integration that worked perfectly in test mode but randomly failed with real customers. I thought I was making money while actual payments were bouncing. AI couldn't explain webhook validation or why certain cards were getting declined without proper error handling.\n\nDatabase performance that was fine with 10 users but completely shit with 1,000+. Every query started timing out. AI kept suggesting caching fixes instead of telling me I was running garbage queries on unindexed tables. My dashboard was loading every single data point instead of paginating like a normal human would.\n\nUser sessions that just randomly logged people out. What happens when someone's subscription expires while they're using the app? How do you handle multiple browser tabs? AI could fix individual bugs but had no clue how to build proper session management.\n\nData isolation problems where customers could see each other's data. That's a fun support ticket to get. AI had zero understanding of how to debug multi-tenant architecture or why my database setup was fundamentally broken.\n\nBilling logic that looked perfect but created accounting chaos. Proration, failed payment retries, subscription changes - the AI code \"worked\" but had edge cases that destroyed my revenue tracking. One customer downgrading somehow triggered three billing events and I couldn't figure out what the hell happened.\n\nThe turning point was realizing I needed to be a better AI supervisor, not just blindly trust whatever code it spat out. Started setting up actual logging for critical actions, testing payment flows with real cards before launching, keeping a simple spreadsheet of what actually worked vs what looked good in dev.\n\nSpent a few weeks learning database basics, payment processing fundamentals, how web apps actually handle user data and security. Not trying to become a senior dev, just enough to read server logs and understand when something was genuinely broken vs a quick fix.\n\nMost success stories skip the part where they got stuck for weeks on subscription billing or had to hire actual developers to rebuild their payment system. The sweet spot is learning just enough SaaS fundamentals to not get completely destroyed by production, then using AI to move 10x faster on the stuff you actually understand.\n\nStill using AI for 90% of my development, but now I can tell when it's giving me code that'll explode in production vs code that'll actually work with real users and real money.",

With any industry when you are explaining technical concepts to someone new to it or not technically savvy I think it’s important to transcribe the technical terminology into words that can be understood by anyone. 1) it hardens your own skills being able to do that and 2) it demystifies the system for the person you are explaining the concepts to which is critical. It’s easy to overwhelm someone, and I think too many ppl’s egos prevent them from transcribing the lingo into every day terms everyone can understand.",

This is a subtle auth thing that flies under the radar. Lock on user row when refreshing token - don't blindly refresh. To servers this looks like lost creds and multiple big OAuth providers require re-auth.\n\n\nE: if it's not clear, imagine the auth server getting a refresh tokens request, refreshing the token, and then getting another request for the old, now revoked token.

      "text": "I don’t know how to write code and I have never built anything before. I’m just a middle aged dude that started building now, AI makes superhumas out of people (people that really know hot to leverage it). People call it vibecoding but I think that word is fucking stupid. \n\nAnyways, for brief context: I’m building a mini-webapp (it’s called Picturific) that automatically generates multiple images with zero prompts, while keeping character and style continuity. \n\nThis is how it went down.\n\nI went to Austin for a music show (the band’s name is Orchid, if anyone cares) for 3 days. I did not take my laptop and I did not check emails. I only checked emails when arrived, and I started seeing receipts from FAL. At first I saw 2, which I thought and knew was a lot. But I did not think much of it. I continued working. Then I came back to check the emails again. I scrolled more. And a shitload of these FAL emails started appearing.\n\nIn less than 72 hours, my project had burned through $700+. Fuck.\n\nI had no idea how this happened.\n\nI spent the next 6 hours pissed, digging through logs, with the help of the same AI that had messed up the code. But I had no choice, I don’t know how to code. I had to work with the AI knowing it was capable of fucking up again. \n\nIt turns out I (or rather the AI) had built what the AI called a \"Ghost Machine.\" If you're building with AI agents and cloud functions, you might want to read this.\n\nOne of the core values of my app Picturific is consistency. To keep our characters looking the same across x scenes, I built an \"AI Auditor\" (The AI called it the Eye of Sauron). After every image is generated, the auditor checks it against a character reference sheet. If the hair is slightly wrong or a character is missing a medal (for example), it rejects the image and triggers a retry.\n\nThe Hallucination Cascade\n\nI asked the AI to plan the scenes based on a long story. I asked for 3 images. But the AI got \"excited\" or something and returned a plan for 22 scenes instead. Since I didn't have a hard cap on the logic yet, my code started 22 separate tasks.\n\nThe \"Zombie Worker\" Loop. \n\nThis was the real fuck up. Some of these complex generations were taking 2 minutes. My cloud provider (Supabase) has a \"self-healing\" feature. If a task takes too long, the cloud thinks it crashed and automatically restarts it.\n\nBecause I hadn't built \"Checkpointing\" (the code didn't check if it was already on its 3rd attempt after a restart), the newly born worker would start the cycle all over again.\n\nThe result of this was that one single user click triggered an infinite loop of AI agents fighting each other over shit like \"incorrect hair shading,\" with the cloud platform constantly reviving the dead processes to keep the war going. At $0.15 a generation, the bill moved fast.\n\nThe Three (very fucking expensive) Lessons (that hopefully will save you some trouble):\n\n1. AI doesn’t understand your budget. You can't trust an LLM to follow a \"Number of Images\" constraint if the input text is long. It can hallucinate scope. You must hard-code limits into your backend. If you don't have a \"Circuit Breaker\" in your code, you’re just handing your credit card to a toddler who likes to click buttons.\n2. The Cloud is a Multiplier. \"Self-healing\" cloud functions are great for uptime, but they are a nightmare for \"Leaky\" AI logic. If your code can trigger a restart without checking its own history, a small bug becomes a massive financial leak.\n3. Visibility is your only defense. If I hadn't been logging every single \"Audit Failure\" and \"Task Start\" in a forensic database, I would have had no way to explain the $700. I would have just seen a high bill and probably quit the project. Detailed logs are the only reason I was able to find exactly why what happened happened, and how to fix it without probably having to restart the whole thing (this is probablue due to me not being a developer and not being able to read code).\n\nFor now, I have plugged the leaks. I limited the AI scope, fixed the restart loops, and taught the \"Auditor\" that perfection isn't worth bankruptcy, or something like that.\n\nThe silver linings is that the \"forced\" retries actually worked—the consistency is better than ever because the AI eventually \"learned\" what I wanted.\n\nIt’s been an expensive lesson, but the output is finally something I’m proud of.\n\nWhat's your worst AI fuck-up story?",

The zombie worker loop combined with auditor retries is a nasty combo.\n\n  \nA few things that saved me after learning the hard way:\n\n  \n1. Hard spending caps on every API key - most providers let you set this. Set it lower than you think you need. You can always raise it but you cant get the money back\n\n  \n2. Circuit breakers with exponential backoff - after X failures in Y minutes, stop entirely and alert yourself. Dont let the system keep trying forever\n\n  \n3. Idempotency keys - so if a task restarts it can check if it already completed successfully instead of starting fresh\n\n  \n4. Separate dev keys with tiny limits - never use production API keys during development, its too easy to accidentally run a loop\n\n  \n5. Per-request cost tracking - log estimated cost per API call so you can see it accumulating in real time\n\n  \nThe self-healing cloud function thing is brutal. Vercel, Supabase, AWS Lambda - they all restart on timeout by default. You have to explicitly build in checkpointing to survive restarts gracefully.\n\n  \nThe silver lining is youll never make this mistake again. And the quality improvement from forced retries is real - I had a similar experience where the retries actually improved output quality because the AI learned from previous attempts.\n\n  \nWhat provider are you using for the image generation?

FAL, openai, replicate, anthropic — all of them have billing limits. set them before you write a single line of code. $50 cap would have saved you $650.\n\n2. never let AI decide how many times to run something without a circuit breaker. if your code can loop, it will loop. hardcode max retries (3-5 is usually plenty).\n\n3. for the auditor pattern specifically — there's a real concept called 'good enough' thresholds. instead of rejecting on any imperfection, score the output 0-100 and accept anything above 70. the difference between 85% and 99% consistency is usually invisible to users but costs 10x more in compute.\n\n4. set up billing alerts. every cloud provider has them. $10, $25, $50 thresholds. email + slack notification. takes 5 minutes.\n\nthe silver lining you mentioned is real though — forced retries with good logging actually produce better training signal than getting it right the first time. expensive lesson but the knowledge compounds.",

Poor project planning, I say this because while you think you reviewed the project documents you didn't review them with a panel of experts. Some of this can be automated. \n\nUltimately, better source documents means better end product. Here is an example:\n\nYou tell AI to write an application and when it comes back it's missing 24 API endpoints and 35% of the database structure, UI/UX logic, etc. \n\nWhen you properly plan this process out the AI will build out everything and keep a map to everything as well. \n\nPersonally I went backwards in time on my practices with software development using AI. I actually stumbled into the idea that if you plan everything and I really do mean every detail you can get a working finished product using some of the most complex coding languages today. \n\nI do charge for assistance on project refactoring, etc. and I'm already pretty booked up. For the right price though my schedule just opened up.\n\nI primarily focus on Secure SaaS solutions and have built several sites which the longest project was quoted to taking 2 to 3 years by a team of 6 which I had it planned and coded in less than a month. I spent the next 2 months source reviewing and verifying the logic before sending it off to the client and they were very excited. :-)\n\nThis work was under a strict NDA so I can't show off the finished work sadly.  That site was a really cool idea and they even provided me patents they already had in a pending state and asked me to see if their ideas would work and if they didn't to find an alternative way. (Yes, AI can also do that as well.)\n\nI include a final code scan to validate if it detected any patent infringement. It's not perfect of course but one thing to remember; all main steam AI models contain patents as a source. AI is able to tell you if it used a patent during development.",

More importantly, it’s stable and still growing month over month.\n\nWhat surprised me most is that none of this came from TikTok hype, Instagram reels, or viral launches. No big audience. No “growth hacks.” Just a boring combination of shipping consistently, fixing UX friction, listening to user complaints, and iterating for months.\n\nPeople keep saying the app market is dead, SaaS is saturated, hardware is impossible, etc. From what I’m seeing, that’s mostly noise. Revenue still compounds if you keep improving something real. Whether you’re building a mobile app, a SaaS, or even a physical product: if users are getting value and you keep showing up, the curve eventually bends upward. It’s not glamorous, but it works.\n\nI’m still iterating on my app daily, and I expect it to keep growing and not because of hype, but because people actually use it.\n\n**If you’re in a slump right now: don’t stop. This is probably the best time in history to keep building.**",

Also the ads wont be too much for the user as I am just doing side bars and small ad placements embedded in parts of the ui so no pop ups. \n\nAlso I couldn't agree more we are just getting started in this new golden age of tech!",
