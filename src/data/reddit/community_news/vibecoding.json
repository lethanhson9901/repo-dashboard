Just read the damn output and ask about it, the concepts, the documentation, ask about the documentation, and so on.\n\nAre people allergic to learning new things? If you spend so much time understanding how to prompt an AI (even though vibe coders don't seem to do that either), why not also learn the contents of the output?\n\nAnd I say that as somebody who hated to code.

                  "text": "My argument is always that vibe coding actually typically reduces tech debt when you pan out how things happen in real life. I worked in a think-tank that was brought in to startups to implement or fix something for years, so I got to see the actual live codebase of at least fifty startups.\n\nTypically two scenarios in a startup:\n\nWithout vibe coding. You take time off work or work overtime for months to get a minimum viable product for investors. You're either operating on a super tight budget because you're not working or you're strapped for time because you're working at 10PM after working all day. This prioritizes cutting corners and the resulting code has a shitload of tech debt. When you finally get funding, you've invested hundreds of hours into the codebase, so you typically make it work and just have to live with the problems.\n\nWith vibe coding. You rip out an MVP in a few weeks easily. Vibe coding is excellent at getting a quick idea materialized fast, it struggles later when the project is very complex. This puts you into the funding stage really fast and you can usually be doing this while you're also employed, so you can take your time and often get a better investment deal. When you finally get funding, you can basically discard your original MVP and use it to plan the full project. This makes the full project have way less tech debt because the vibe coded MVP is kind of a \"draft\".",

Out of every 5 designers/artists from my network 4 are rotationally unemployed/turned to commission based).\n\nKeep shitting on \"vibe coding\", I give it 18 months before we're in dev-pocalypse as it was for art.\n\nMy2cent: stop gatekeeping/feeling like an elitist c*nt with \"I won't touch AI code..\" good. Guess you'll be a fossil then and be phased out.\n\nThe hat is out of the basket. \n\nSoftware developers might feel like they're hot shit, but in reality just like AI code generation has limitations, so do you mr \"senior software developer\", then again, I worked with SDs in the $150k range, and I assure you, I'd rather pay $0.15-0.50 per good prompt and achieve what I want in 40-50 prompts. It might not be perfect, and \"needs security cleanup\" yadiyada, of course you should get professional eyes to it before hitting production, I have more faith in 50 prompts vibecoded for $20 than whatever you think a \"real\" dev can achieve for what they'd be paid in 30mins (and even at 40-50$ an hour its a stretch). I've had AI projects set up, ready, and in a prototype phase in 2 hours when it used to take 2weeks. No. The 2 hour output is not equivalent to 2 weeks, but 3-5 days? Yes. Scope would be for a fulltime dev to generate that. In those situations, its feasible paying $20 in credits vs $500-900.\n\nIts not a X vs Y though. It never was. But while \"i won't touch AI code with a 6 foot stick\", someone else is, while understanding how to prompt better and/or use it only for simple functions. You can stay sleeping an extra hour if you want, meanwhile someone else will eat your lunch.\n\nIf you think \"its just a bubble\" or that it won't reach a point you'd need \"3 engineers on a project\" instead of 5, then tell me again how you're pissed off because you were one of the fossils cut.",

Maybe he’s an AI hater and wants my project to fail or be hacked in the future. At least with AI, there are levels, rankings, and reputations and I prefer it. Although I like the idea of Replit to add a  human coder \"marketplace\" inside their product. This is really good idea, but I personally don't use their AI framework. \nAlso, a professional construction engineer won’t always find every issue either. If we want to raise the level of checks, we can ask a third or a fourth AI. And comparing AI to a “retarded engineer” is not correct, top AIs are already at the level of a mid-level engineer.",

So I feel that's how vibe-coding must be used, you know some skill and you enhance its implementation using AI to get way better results.  \nBut the way they market vibe-coding as something that one using it can create multi-million dollar SaaS products with 3 nights of prompts is what makes it so hated.

          "text": "I'm not a software developer nor am I a hardcore vibe coder; I've played around with it. However, I am in IT. I understand the difference between a development environment and a production environment. So I see merits in both sides of the argument. It is fun to build something that wouldn't have been possible before AI. Like wanting to make a song, but not having any musical talent. You can hear the song in your head, but you can't reproduce it in the real world. AI let's all that happen. It can be intoxicating.\n\nHowever, I can also see the concern for a flood of garbage on the market. If every app in the app stores were vibe coded by someone with zero knowledge, then the risk of leaks and hacks would increase exponentially.\n\nSo, the problem isn't AI or making things with its help. It's just a tool, like a hammer. It'll do what you tell it to do. The problem is people thinking that they don't need to know jack shit to put something into production. That's not going to go well, in any scenario. \n\nThe solution is to work in a development environment and actually learn while building. It's called due diligence and it's encouraged in any industry. I don't think the argument is that you need to be a senior developer to build an app. Rather, you need to build an app like a senior developer, if that makes sense.\n\nFor example, I started a project to see if I could build a .NET app that would integrate with GitHub and act as a PowerShell script repository, with dynamic updates and what not. Now, I know very little about writing C# code. However, being in IT, I know I needed unit tests and a CI/CD pipeline. I also know I needed authentication of some type, 2FA, and role based access. Not only to protect the repository, but also, I have some PowerShell scripts that will bring an entire network to its knees if not used by someone with the proper knowledge. Anyhoo, my point being, I had to have knowledge of all of that, understand what it means, and know how to tell AI how to do it. That brings me to my next point: The codebase got so complex that Claude Sonnet could no longer handle it. I think I'll have to continue with Claude Opus, at this point, which I don't have access to, ATM. But, I wouldn't know that Claude was struggling if I wasn't paying attention to what it was doing and outputting.\n\nAnyway, I think that's the criticism that the developers are offering; some more curmudgeonly than others, but mostly the same point. It's not that vibe coding is bad. You just need to know what you're doing still, before entering the production environment, especially if you care at all about your customers/users.",

Congrats on shipping and getting that first customer.\n\nI'm also building with Claude + Cursor (49, zero coding background before March 2024, now have 2 apps live with paying customers). So I get the excitement of \"holy shit, this actually works.\"\n\nBut I also want to address the concern in the comments, because it's valid:\n\nVibe coding is incredible for getting things built. But when real money and user data are involved, there's a responsibility layer that AI tools don't automatically handle.\n\nWhat I've learned shipping AI-built products:\n\nTest the hell out of payment flows. I use Stripe, and I spent days testing every edge case. Failed payments, refunds, subscription cancellations, webhook failures. AI writes the initial code, but I test like my reputation depends on it (because it does).\n\nSecurity isn't optional. Even if you don't understand the code, you need to understand what the code is doing with user data. Read through the authentication logic. Understand where data is stored. Use established services (Supabase, Stripe, Auth0) that handle the hard security stuff.\n\n\"Codebase is probably a mess\" is fine for MVP, but... once you have paying customers, you need to either learn enough to maintain it safely OR hire someone to audit the critical paths (auth, payments, data handling).\n\nThe \"fix this error pls\" approach works until it doesn't. For features, it's great. For security and payment handling, you need to actually understand what's happening, not just that \"it works.\"\n\nHere's my personal rule:\n\n\\- Vibe coding for: Features, UI, business logic, integrations, 90% of the app\n\n\\- Extra careful with: Authentication, payments, user data, anything that could harm someone if it breaks\n\nThis isn't anti-vibe-coding. I've built everything with AI tools. But I also know I'm responsible for what ships.\n\nYour app working and getting customers is awesome. Just make sure you're also:\n\n✅ Using Stripe or similar (not handling card data yourself)\n\n✅ Have proper error handling on payment flows\n\n✅ Following App Store guidelines on subscriptions\n\n✅ Can respond if something breaks at 2 AM\n\nThe community celebrating vibe coding wins is great. But we also need to be honest about the responsibility that comes with real users and real money.\n\nCongrats on the first customer. Now the real work begins: keeping them happy and safe.\n\nWhat are you using for payments and backend? Happy to share what's worked for me if helpful.",

If you combine the huge power of these models with the knowledge/experience of real developers, you can become super-human. One dev can basically achieve what was previously possible by a team of devs in the fraction of cost/time, without compromising on code quality / tech debt.\n\nAt this point \"vibe coding\" or \"AI assisted coding\" (if you want to sound \"serious\") should be the norm, not something to make fun of, and anyone who knows what he/she's doing, can become a beast.",

That does not equate to what a very experienced engineer could create. Thats like saying I can buy campbells soup, heat it and put it in a bowl and telling a Michelin chef that I also made soup and bark at him that it took me less than 2 minutes. The Michelin chef will surely think I’m an idiot. \n\nAs far as llm’s go and their training data. The best code and algorithm implementations are IP and not in the public domain. Google would never train their models to learn their IP and best codebase. Thats also why it is hard for llms to produce the results a seasoned engineer would like- they were not trained on it. You can try and push into a very specific direction but will end up discarding and refactoring. \n\nSo hard no to what you have said. Sorry.",

Do you think someone will unlock some powerful magical production method that will make us all wank around? We are now able to dig holes faster than ever, so do you think demand for holes will increase? Software products are all over the place and most are simply pointless. We can now do more of the pointless and none of the people who are knee deep into this can do more than the others. It is an open field. What one knows the others can too. It’s still the same thing but with yet another abstraction. It is a form of increased democratization but it will only lead to more crap done faster, not ultra quality done instantly by one person that replaces dozens. We are still the same dumb egotistical asshats. Just use the thing, get your work done. It’s anyway going to be sent to the bin. But much faster now. This is a form of mass hysteria. Things will change but not seismically. Just go at a butcher shop or the mayor‘a office and tell me if you see the panic of magic automation.",

Run up thousands in API charges. Use it for anything they want.\n\nThis isn't a vibe coding problem. It's a fundamentals problem.\n\nYour app should never know your secrets. Ever.\n\n**The fix is simple:** run a backend proxy. App calls your server, server authenticate your app, calls OpenAI. Keys stay on your server where they belong.\n\nAll that speed means nothing if your API key ends up on GitHub or worse.",

              "text": "This is a great question that reveals an incomplete understanding.  Let me try to round you out.  The issue is not really about .env or not, instead it's really about whether your secret is embedded and available to the client-side code or the server-side code.  Server side is more secure, and generally you're gonna be fine using .env there.\n\nIf you're reading this and you're already lost, go ask your AI to explain to you which parts of your code are server-side, which parts are clientside.  These fancy web frameworks these days blend the two so it's understandable newcomers just think it's all the same, and if you truly vibecoded your app beginning to end, odds are it'll be using something like Next.js etc, and you'll eventually confuse the two when trying to vibe out some new feature.\n\nAnyways, what happens clientside is that that code often gets delivered to the users browser - wholesale - html, js, css and all, and what happens is unaware developers will accidentally include/bundle secrets in that js.  Yes \"production\" builds of that js can often be minified, but that doesn't actually change the key if it's included - afterall, if you think about it, you need your js to still make valid API calls.  Web frameworks do this because sometimes you don't care for your pages to be webscraper friendly, and instead sending along all that js actually allows that js to run, making the user experience change and by dynamic without ever needing to actually communicate with the server.\n\nThis is where the risk is, you may inadvertently be including a client that calls out to something else, and oops! Client needs it's API key or token or whatever, oh you'll just import it no big deal right? Whelp there you have it.  When this runs, your secret param is resolved, and hiding in the JS of your page.  It's a mistake I've seen dozens of times from people just learning these modern \"hybrid\" style web technologies - even well before vibe coding was a thing.\n\nHonestly, in my experience, this is a far more common oversight than committing your secrets to git.  A few other comments mentioned using something other than .env - it's important to know in web development none of those will save you if you don't fundamentally understand the difference between client-side code, and server side code.",

      "text": "Since vibe coding came into existence, I have been experimenting with building products a lot. Some of my products were consumer facing and some.. well, internal clones of expensive software. However, since beginning, I knew one big thing - **the vibe stack was expensive.**\n\n  \nI initially tried a lot of tools - Bolt, v0, Replit, Lovable, etc. out of which Replit game me the best results (yes, I can be biased due to my selection of applications). **But I often paid anywhere from $25-$200/mo. Other costs like API, models, etc. made monthly bills upward of $300/mo.** Was it cost effective when compared to hiring a developer? Yes. Was it value for money? NO.\n\n  \nSo, over the months, I optimised by complete stack to be either free (or minimal cost) for internal use or stay at a much lean cost for consumer-facing products. \n\nHere's how the whole stack looks today - \n\n1. IDE - [Google's AntiGravity](https://antigravity.google) (100% free + higher access if you use student ID)\n\n2. AI Documentation - [SuperDocs](https://superdocs.cloud) (100% free & open source)\n\n3. Database - [Supabase](http://supabase.com) (Nano plan free, enough for basic needs)\n\n4. Authentication - [Stack Auth](http://stack-auth.com) (Free upto 10K users)\n\n5. LLM (AI Model) - [OpenRouter](http://openrouter.ai) or [Gemini via AI Studio](http://aistudio.google.com) for testing and a custom tuned model by [Unsloth AI](http://unsloth.ai) for production. (You can fine-tune models using Unsloth literal in a Google Colab Notebook)\n\n6. Version Maintenance/Distribution  - [Github](http://GitHub.com)/[Gitlab](http://gitlab.com) (both totally free and open source)\n\n7. Faster Deployment - [Vercel](http://Vercel.com) (Free Tier Enough for Hobbyists)\n\n8. Analytics - [PostHog](http://posthog.com), [Microsoft Clarity](http://clarity.microsoft.com) & [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com) (All 3 are free and independent for different tracking, I recommend using all of them)\n\n  \nThat's the list devs! I know I might have missed something. If yes, just ask me up or list them up in the comments. If you have any questions related to something specific, ask me up as well. ",

I’ve built a few apps with no software engineering experience and I know, eventually, if I want to take anything to market I’ll have to hire somebody or a team of people to either fix what I’ve built or start from scratch using my app as a prototype.\n\nMy biggest concern is working with somebody who will just end up reading advantage of my lack of knowledge or experience. Any tips?",

If you need to AI generate irrelevant watercolor paintings for your meals, you’ve already lost me. \n\nAlso you can’t easily read the description of meals on your recipe pages with the water color painting behind the text.

So I handed my code base to them, and they're iframing it into the backend website. They're ensuring the security is good to go.\n\nI've refactored the entire codebase to bring it up to professional standards. This took weeks of effort, but it was worth it. My dev team will also review it (with AI lol) so they'll point out anything alarming.\n\nDude.... That last part... Holy shit man. If you're building anything bigger than a simple script, Claude Code is absolutely in a different galaxy compared to copying and pasting.\n\nAre you familiar with it? It lives in your terminal. It accesses your entire codebase, and edits all relevant files for you. No copying+pasting. Just watch it do all the work for you. No more worrying about indentations on pasting.\n\nAnd Claude Code's abilities are absolutely mind blowing. I ask it stuff, and it tracks the logic through every step of my entire gigantic code base. Then it cleanly and perfectly spits out the right code changes. Sure sometimes it takes some massaging, but in general, it can one-shot really big tasks.\n\nI've been using it for months, but I still routinely laugh out loud at its abilities. It traces things so carefully. It'll scan through 15 files and then say \"Okay I've figured it out! In step 7 of your ETL, you didn't ztype this variable, which is required once step 11 executes and searches for it. That's what was causing the issue! I'll fix it now.\"\n\nGet your company to pay for the $100/month Max plan if you can. Or at least the lower-cost version. It's SO WORTH IT!",

I’m extremely lucky.\n\nIt helps that I churn out amazing work products for them consistently, so they don’t care to check in on me.\n\nPlus I made sure to negotiate all pay increase structures before handing over my code heh. I intentionally kept putting it off until we agreed to the pay structure. I got a bonus for handing over the code, then I’ll get the monthly payout (25% of the cost of the tool) once we roll it out to the whole company in a few months. I’ll also get another one-time bonus after a successful rollout.\n\nI completely agree - My speed has increased exponentially over time. I think if I started from scratch today, I could rebuild the whole thing in a month or less. That’s why I don’t even care about  handing them the code base. I’d probably build it even better today with my current knowledge vs my literal 0 knowledge when I started 9 months ago\n\nIt definitely feels like a hobby, but the real world products it can create are very real/useful!

Feels narrow-minded.  Especially since BTC has been around for almost 20 years now, and with the incoming signing of the CLARITY Act in the USA this year, using stablecoins is going to be much more commonplace soon.\n\nAnyways, I vibe coded a game that let's you buy game pieces with crypto. I've made some money from that, without having to deal with stripe or online payment vendor integration.  Making it was fun as hell.  https://www.chaoschess.online",

      "text": "[Live Demo](https://carto-art.vercel.app/) | No signup required\n\nI saw a street vendor selling simple map posters a while back and thought \"I could build that.\" A brief day of vibing later, here's Carto-Art\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l5rl2ruvbhag1.jpg?width=5400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0a4845547bc682d37137b13cd502065af050f24\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Pick any location (auto-detects yours on load)\n* Toggle layers: streets, buildings, water, parks, topography, population density\n* Choose from a bunch of styles (minimal line art, dark mode, blueprint, abstract, etc.)\n* Swap colors in real-time\n* Export at print quality (up to 7200×10800px for a 24×36\" poster at 300 DPI)\n\n**The fun technical bits:**\n\nThe hardest part was the export system. The preview you see on screen is way lower resolution than what gets exported, so I had to build two separate render paths and keep them perfectly in sync. Tricky, but satisfying when it clicked.\n\nThe terrain shading was the most fun to implement. It uses Terrain-RGB tiles where each pixel's color encodes elevation, then runs it through a hillshading algorithm on the GPU. The shadows and highlights adapt to whatever color palette you pick, so it actually looks integrated rather than like a generic overlay slapped on top.\n\n**Stack:**\n\n* Next.js 16 + Tailwind\n* MapLibre GL JS (via React Map GL)\n* OpenStreetMap data via OpenFreeMap\n* Nominatim for geocoding\n* MapTiler Terrain-RGB tiles\n\n**Why it's free:**\n\nIt's 100% frontend. No backend, no database, no auth. Runs on Vercel's free tier. I pay nothing to keep it alive.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. Drop a location in the comments and I'll generate one if you want to see a specific style\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbf090x9bhag1.png?width=5400&format=png&auto=webp&s=3681fb045924c84ed3c3cf70d35679232b6cdb71\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2r22kidpbhag1.jpg?width=5400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccdad5bb13824cd1123effb63c421be29ef23979",

You have to stop coding, go generate images, edit them, and drag them in.\n\nWith the **Nano Banana** integration, I just vibed the visual requirements along with the code.\n\n* *Me:* \"I need fun images of energy sprites that match the content of each screen in the onboarding carousel - use a cool \"electric blue\" color palette.\"\n* *IDE:* Writes the SwiftUI code AND generates/places the pixel art assets.\n\nIt felt less like coding and more like directing a small studio.\n\nHas anyone else messed with the Nano Banana model yet? I feel like it's being slept on compared to the coding agents.\n\nThe app is here if you want to see the final UI: [aifootprint.ai](https://aifootprint.ai/)",

I can see which style I like between different models and then iterate from there. You buy a chunk of tokens and then use them up, with some models costing more than others. Great tool - not integrated in the same way nano banana is with Antigravity, but if you want a great image generation tool, it's a good one.

Using google/apple SSO, I guess. In that casa you are most likely storing a cookie (or the user would have to login again everytime). In this case, you need an opt in cookie policy, at least for Europe.\n\nThe idea is really nice but you should pay attention to this stuff or you may face the app getting removed from the stores or, worse, a lawsuit. \n\nI know it may feel like a boring annoying stuff, but it's EU regulation, the same reason why not all the chatGPT/Claude/Gemini features are available in Europe (or they are being rolled out late). 😅",

We intentionally stay conservative because video energy use explodes quickly with quality.\n\nNOTE: We're revising to \\~10 Wh per second in the next update based on latest credible data.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nWe continuously scan 2025 research and frontier disclosures, adjust when consensus shifts, and communicate results as **ranges for impact awareness—not billing-grade precision.** As better telemetry becomes public, the model will keep improving.\n\nOn water: we didn’t include it because it’s **far messier and less standardized than energy** right now. Water use varies hugely by data-center location, cooling method, climate, and local power mix, and providers don’t report water at a per-model or per-query level. That makes estimates easy to misinterpret or overstate, even though water use is real and important. Energy is currently the **most measurable and comparable signal**, so we focused there first — but expanding “footprint” to include water (and other resources) is absolutely something we want to do as the data improves.",

Great for learning but nobody was paying for any of it.\n\nAt some point I started looking at where the money actually flows online, and it became pretty obvious: AI is the biggest opportunity right now with insane growth, and NSFW has been the most profitable niche on the internet since forever. When you combine both you get a massive market with surprisingly few serious players.\n\nSo I started building in this space.\n\nThe problem I ran into was that I needed to make sure my apps wouldn't generate anything illegal like CSAM or deepfakes of real people. But I also didn't want to limit the explicit content too much because that's what users are paying for.\n\nI couldn't find a good solution so I ended up building my own API: [kwikiai.com/guides/nsfw-ai-api](https://kwikiai.com/guides/nsfw-ai-api)\n\nI haven't even set up payments on it yet, I just want people to try it. If you have no idea what to build and you're tired of making things nobody uses, maybe give this niche a shot and let me know what you think.\n\nAlso, Merry Christmas to y'all!",

Supported sdxl and pretty much ALL models from Civitai.\n\nWe were spending 2k per month on heavy servers. Got a bunch of free users and (very few) paying users. We kept that going for a couple of months until it just wasn't worth it.\n\nBut I think you'll do better focusing on a specific audience and we've progressed a bit. People understand the concept and potential of tools like this better now.\n\nBest of luck to you",

I did that with todo apps, mini CRMs, dashboards for made up data, you name it.\n\nIt was fun, and honestly it made me better at thinking in systems, but when the year ended I realised something a bit sad:\n\nI had a graveyard full of half-finished vibe coded projects and not a single thing I actually used every day.\n\nSo my New Year deal with myself is different.  \nThis year I want at least one vibe coded thing that survives January.\n\nRight now I am doing it like this:\n\n* I still vibe code the logic and ideas with an LLM, because that is the fun part\n* but when it starts looking promising, I move it into something a bit more serious so it does not fall apart the moment I add real data or real users\n\nFor internal style stuff I have been experimenting with UI Bakery for that second step. My little resolution project is a small B2B-ish tool on top of a real Postgres DB. I let the AI inside UI Bakery scaffold the UI and workflows, then I go in and fix the weird bits by hand. It still feels like vibe coding, just with a slightly more grown up frame around it.\n\nI am not trying to turn this into a “use X, Y is bad” post. If anything, last year taught me that the tool matters less than the loop:\n\nidea → messy AI sketch → clean up → actually use it\n\nCurious how everyone else is starting the year:\n\nAre you planning to keep pure vibe coding for fun prototypes  \nAre you trying to turn any of your LLM-born monsters into real products or internal tools  \nAnd if you already did that, what stack did you end up with in the end\n\nWould love to read some “I finally turned my cursed weekend project into something real” stories to kick off the year.",

I don't really vibe code, but I do a lot of agentic coding, and I feel like the nuance is given to the creative power you hand over to the AI. I am working on a couple of solution (two for work, one passion project and a thing that matches 100% of my needs on a specific thing) and they're all thought as fully fledge products first. It can never be \"Hey Claude Code, make me an app\", it's : massive PRD with UI/UX documents, stack thought out according to the needs of every project, reading a lot about services, lots of docs... THIS is part of the fun. Being a project manager is fun. Coding and solving problems is fun too, but I feel like vibe coding is more efficient AND more fun when considered as your lead developper in your own virtual company in which you are the CEO, CTO and N+1 of all your agents.",

When I’m lazy about the thinking, the code feels like chaos, no matter how good the model is.\n\nFor my little New Year project I kind of split it in two steps:  \nfirst I do exactly what you describe (write the doc, think through flows), then I let AI help with the heavy lifting and wire it into something like UI Bakery for the internal UI. It still feels like vibe coding, but with that project manager brain turned on before I start.\n\nTotally agree that the fun is in owning the whole thing, not just watching a bot spit out files.",

I spend WAAAY more time planning / architecting prior to throwing AI at it to code it. Before I used to try and constantly course correct and it just took forever, I'd get frustrated and stop. I still try to \"one shot\" my apps that I vibe code but I feel like I'm a lot more deliberate with it now which helps (and gets me more invested into it).\n\n2. This is going to make me sound incredibly lazy (maybe?), but I stopped typing and it did wonders.  I think I saw Theo or someone do it and decided to try it and loved...I feel like I can go for a lot longer now. One caveat here is that it isn't free. I started with [whisprflow](https://wisprflow.ai/) since that seems to be the big player, but I don't use enough of the features to warrant $15/mo imo. I switched to [SpeakLane](https://speaklane.app/) and although I miss some features of whisprflow, I LOVE not having to pay every month for my level of usage. I'm sure there are 50 other tools out there too. \n\nI feel like my problem this year is likely going to be less \"finish my project\" and more \"keep marketing it and trying to grow it after its done\", thats the part I still struggle with and haven't found a way to vibe code that away yet.",

Not a problem for click-through prototype creation, but can be a challenge for building full-stack apps. At least in my experience, working with v0 (by Vercel), I found that starting simple can bite me later on, when I need more sophistication. Somehow, it would lock into an architecture, then it later struggles to modify to meet more complex needs. After getting frustrated in my attempts to evolve the app, I started from scratch and outlined some key considerations about types of things I need it to do down the road. This helped v0 lay out a more robust architecture. I still approached it iteratively, but got to my result with fewer iterations, and more importantly, fewer frustrations!",

After the first UI Mock with replit I moved to Codex, Antigravity and Copilot, but that didn't matter much. Key was that in every iteration I demanded an extensive plan and tests for everything implemented. No feature was \"finished\" without 80% test coverage, no warnings of compiler or linter. I integrated that early on, going forward in small iterations feature by feature and that prevented most breaks. I saw the AI run into cycles of \"Now it is finished.\" \"Oh the tests break. let me see...\"\"Now it's finished...\" And so on - in one iteration alone... Without tests it would have broken everything in every feature, multiple times. This way I had only 5-10 minor issues like a button that didn't work or had no visual feedback.\n\nSo my take is: Build something you really are your own customer in, work in small, cleary defined iterations and tests, tests, tests...",

In most cases, the backend is either unfinished or incorrectly implemented, and the developer lacks the ability to properly diagnose or correct those issues.\n\nChoosing not to focus on syntax is not inherently a problem. I have taken that approach myself and maintain stable professional employment. However, this path requires strong debugging and reasoning skills. Without those, the tradeoff becomes a liability rather than an advantage.\n\nA recurring issue is the absence of basic validation. Many developers claim to have built functional systems without running even minimal checks, cross-validation, or structured debugging. As a result, these systems often fail under real conditions.\n\nRather than producing superficial applications that replicate existing work, I focus on building robust back-end systems. The emphasis is on correctness, structure, and mathematical verifiability. AI tools are not a substitute for understanding; they require precise instructions, well-defined constraints, and careful evaluation of outputs. Even then, human oversight remains essential.\n\nThere is a tendency at one extreme to dismiss these approaches as impractical, and at the other to treat AI as a shortcut that removes the need for rigor. In reality, effective systems emerge only when structure, verification, and accountability are treated as first-class concerns.",

It would verify what happened, make sure it’s repeatable, and then label it as “good” or “bad,” but in a way where “good” or “bad” isn’t always fixed. On top of that, it would run multiple slightly different variations at once and map the logic using hashes, Hamming distance, and similar methods.\n\nIf people can code this well with AI without checking  themselves or the code a random bot wrote, I honestly wonder why no one has made a system like this yet here instead of some crappy app Someome else already made with a crappy UI wrapper on it…🤨",

      "text": "I’ve used the usual “one rules file to rule them all” approach for a while, and it works until your repo gets big.\n\nOnce I moved to a proper monorepo (mobile + web + backend), a single rules file started hurting more than helping. The agent would pull in a bunch of irrelevant constraints, blow the context window, and then confidently do the wrong thing anyway.\n\nSo I switched to a simple layered setup that’s been way more reliable for me. The basic idea: treat agent docs like you’d treat code. Scoped, modular, and loaded only when needed.\n\n# Layer 1: Discovery (AGENTS.md, nested)\n\nRoot has an [`AGENTS.md`](http://AGENTS.md), but I also drop smaller ones inside places like:\n\n* `apps/mobile/AGENTS.md`\n* `packages/ui/AGENTS.md`\n\nEach has docs relevant to the folder, so if one is inside components package I would explain how to structure components, refer to styling, etc.  \n  \nSo when the agent is working in `apps/mobile`, it picks up the mobile rules without being distracted by web/backend stuff. The root file stays short (I try to keep it under \\~100 lines) and the local ones only contain what’s specific to that area.\n\nI also switched fully to [**AGENTS.md**](http://AGENTS.md) and stopped maintaining separate tool-specific rules files. I use multiple IDEs and multiple agents, and keeping separate formats in sync was a mess. [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) is the first “one standard” I’ve seen that most coding agents are converging on.\n\nQuick note: **Claude Code doesn’t support** [**AGENTS.md**](http://AGENTS.md) **yet**, so I keep a [`CLAUDE.md`](http://CLAUDE.md) in the repo root that simply tells it to read the [`AGENTS.md`](http://AGENTS.md) in whatever folder it’s working in.\n\n# Layer 2: Specs (a vibe/ folder)\n\nThis is where I put the deep stuff that you don’t want injected all the time:\n\n* `vibe/schema.md` for the exact Supabase schema\n* `vibe/unistyles-math.md` for our styling logic that’s annoying to re-explain\n\nThe key is: the agent only reads these when the discovery layer points it there. So you get just-in-time context instead of permanently paying token rent for your schema.\n\n# Layer 3: Laws (AI_CONTEXT.md)\n\nThis is the tiny “non negotiables” file. Stuff that should hold true no matter which folder the agent is in.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Use Zustand. Never Redux.\n* Do not add new libraries without asking.\n* Stick to the repo’s core stack decisions.\n\nAnd yes, the root AGENTS.md references this file right near the top. I treat the root AGENTS.md as a router: it points to AI\\_CONTEXT.md for the global rules, then routes the agent to the nearest folder AGENTS.md for local conventions, and to vibe/ when it needs deep specs.\n\n*Why not just put these laws directly in the root AGENTS.md?* Because I want the root file to stay lean and navigational. Once you start stuffing it with global architecture rules, it slowly turns back into the same “one mega rules file” problem.\n\nAnd repeating those global rules in every nested [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) is even worse. They drift, get out of sync, and you end up maintaining docs more than code.\n\nSo AI\\_CONTEXT.md is the stable source of truth that every [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) can reference in one line. It keeps the root file short, avoids duplication across folders, and gives the agent a clear place to check before it invents a new stack decision.\n\n# The part that actually matters: keeping it up to date\n\nThe system only works if you maintain it, so I made it part of “definition of done”:\n\n* If the agent fixes something, it should update the relevant spec in `vibe/`.\n* If the agent makes the same mistake twice (like missing accessibility props), that becomes a rule in the relevant `AGENTS.md`.\n\nOver time it gets weirdly self-healing. Less repeat failure, less babysitting, fewer wasted tokens.\n\nI ended up baking this into my React Native starter ([Shipnative](https://shipnative.app)) mostly because I was tired of recreating the same structure every time. But even if you don’t use my starter, I’d still recommend the layered approach if your repo is scaling to save tokens.\n\nCurious if anyone else is doing nested or inherited rule files like this, or if you’ve found a better way to scope context in monorepos.",

Sometimes the output is bloody awful but after initially disagreeing hard I’ve come to admit it definitely saves a hell of a lot of time.\n\nClaude is different. I’ve recently started using what they suggest whereby one agent manages multiple and it’s seriously impressive - I’m getting high quality and still low usage costs. I don’t hit my 5x usage most of the time. But, there’s a learning curve. Cursor doesn’t have one - it’s so simple you’ve got to be a muppet to not figure it out. Claude also takes absolutely ages for the output in comparison. \n\nClaude’s got a lot of dev ex issues that really are embarrassing at times. Like the console going ape shit, and I tried CC vs code plugin which just sucked (2 months ago, will give it another go soon). \n\nI think Claude just needs to improve the experience and they’ll dominate. But for now, I’d say for cursor wins for velocity. The speed is so much quicker (comparing opus to opus).",

As I have ADHD I loved the aspect of many things happening in parallel, interacting with the agents, hunting down the bugs… of course it was less efficient and I needed to spend a lot more time, but also more fun.\n\nAm I the only one feeling that way? If not… how do you deal with this?",

You have to guide it.  \nIf you blindly accept outputs, you will ship problems.  \nIf you combine it with basic engineering sense, you can move insanely fast.\n\nStill vibe coded the fixes too, just with better constraints this time.\n\nCurious how others handle taking a vibe coded MVP into real production.",

The important part is that you noticed, paused, and fixed it instead of doubling down or ignoring the warnings.\n\nThe framing I’ve found helpful is: vibe coding is for discovery, engineering is for durability. The MVP’s job is to validate demand, not architecture. Once the signal is real, you switch hats and start applying constraints, budgets, and boring best practices which is exactly what you did.",

I used **Appstuck** and they basically:\n\n* Flagged scale issues before users did\n* Helped clean up infra / data decisions\n* Made sure the app wouldn’t fall over with real traffic\n\nStill vibe coded most of the changes, just with better constraints (like you said). It felt like a good middle ground between “move fast” and “don’t shoot yourself in the foot.”",

Thats literally why there is like alpha and beta releases of software before it’s even considered “Prod” lol. \n\nKind of a weird post IMO. This is the same tune anti-AI people have been saying “Yeah but once it gets to prod the slop falls apart” when in reality the same thing happens to non ai generated code too. \n\nIf you know what you are doing, you’ll release better code in advance. However, people seem to gloss over the fact that people usually figure out what they are doing via years of mistakes and learnings. \n\nThe only reason an experienced dev knows the right way to do something is because they did it the wrong way first and/or watched someone else do it the wrong way (when they themselves didn’t yet know the right way.)\n\nThat doesn’t mean AI is only generating slop. Thats why experience devs can code with AI and not generate slop - it becomes a force multiplier for someone who knows what they are doing. And for someone who doesn’t, it allows them to quickly learn the right way to do things and avoid making many of those mistakes - but obviously you’re still going to mess up whether or not you have AI building the code if you’re a new dev.",

Here's the stack:\n\n\n\nMusic: Suno AI (prompted for 1950s jazz in different instrument styles - piano lead, saxophone lead, trumpet lead, etc.)\n\n\n\nVoice: ElevenLabs (created a DJ persona named \"Sonny Nix\" with custom V3 prompts for different emotions)\n\n\n\nWorkflows: n8n (pulls scripts, generates voice drops, arranges files in order)\n\n\n\nAssembly: Logic Pro (crossfades, ducking when voice comes in)\n\n\n\nVideo: FFmpeg one-liner to loop a static image over 3 hours of audio\n\n\n\nImage: DALL-E (1950s radio booth aesthetic)\n\n\n\nWebsite: Lovable (built a /radio page with episode player)\n\n\n\nAlmost the whole thing runs on prompts, APIs, and workflows. I wrote maybe 10 lines of actual code total (mostly FFmpeg commands). Tbh some things I do have to do manually, I just need it to feel real.\n\n\n\nTwo days ago this didn't exist. Now it's a daily radio station.\n\n\n\nWhat started as \"wouldn't it be funny if...\" turned into my favorite thing I've ever built.\n\n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W4z5eHIOag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W4z5eHIOag)\n\n\n\nHappy to share prompts/workflow details if anyone wants to build something similar.",

      "text": "I've been working on my main SaaS for over 2 years now and brought it to $16k MRR. Along the way, I've always been tinkering with other ideas and side projects.\n\nI've tried a lot of things:\n\n* Vibe-coded a few apps with Lovable & Supabase\n* Built 2 internal tools starting with Chef, then iterating in Cursor\n* Built 3 different mobile apps with React Native + Convex\n\nAll of them flopped, but I built them mostly for the experience.\n\nRecently, I started working on a new product, an email marketing tool for SaaS founders. All those learnings helped me build a full-featured app with a reliable backend and AWS integration in about 2 weeks (while still running my other startup).\n\nHere's what I've learned:\n\n**Two non-negotiables**\n\n1. **Use the best model available.** Go into debt if you have to. The difference between Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5 is massive. If you're stuck on older models, you'll be much slower. Right now, it's Claude Code with Opus 4.5. In a month, it might be something else - stay flexible.\n2. **You still need technical knowledge.** AI will produce nonsense sometimes. You need to catch it and correct it.\n\n\n\n**Get the foundations right**\n\nThe most important thing is nailing your architecture early. When you have a solid foundation - properly typed database, coherent structure - iterating on features becomes 10x easier.\n\nHere's what I recommend:\n\n1. **Use TypeScript with strict typings.** No shortcuts.\n2. **Use tRPC (or similar)** to get strong types between frontend and backend.\n3. **Set up your styling system early.** Shadcn works great for most cases.\n4. **Configure ESLint + strict tsconfig** from day one.\n5. **Use a typed ORM.** I prefer Drizzle.\n6. **Think deeply about your schema.** What data do you need to store? How will you process it? I like to brainstorm with Gemini first, get a dump of all the info, then send it to Claude Code to implement.\n\nWhy does all this matter? When you have proper types end-to-end, it's 10x easier for AI to understand all the relationships in your codebase.\n\n**My take on testing**\n\nI strongly believe you should have unit tests for all your core functionality. Mock your database using something like PGlite and you're good to go.\n\nThis helps you move fast while making sure your app actually works. Most of your endpoints should be \\~5 lines where you just call a well-tested function.\n\nAs for UI tests and E2E tests - I don't think they help at this stage. They slow you down, and you'll be changing your UI constantly. If you want to iterate quickly, skip them for now.\n\n**One more tip: keep configuration in code**\n\nWhenever you can, avoid manual setup. If you need to do something on AWS or GCP, use Terraform. Don't go through dashboard hell manually clicking around. It'll speed you up massively in the long run.\n\n**Writing the code**\n\nRun a few agents in parallel. Once you already have the schema, it's easy to add different API requests, screens, etc. at the same time.\n\nEvery 4–6 hours, stop and review everything you've done. Use Cursor Review, ask Claude Code to give you feedback about your PR, and verify that it added zero unexpected fields in the database. Make sure the flow still works as expected.\n\nDon't allow AI to write code for days without review - it'll be incredibly hard to clean up and make useful.\n\n\n\nThat's the flow. If you're building a SaaS and need to set up email sequences for onboarding or retention, check out Sequenzy - we have a generous free tier and you can start sending sequences within minutes of signing up.\n\nGood luck, and ship fast!",

That they are oblivious to security or their UX is terrible or they have not thought through their products well. \n\nHaving worked at multiple tech unicorns it’s not that when we have built products that we have done a spectacular job on these dimensions. We have also made our fair share of mistakes and continue to make them. What’s important is we learn from them. \n\nInstead of welcoming these new class of product builders we seem to be more intent on gatekeeping and fear mongering instead of constructively helping them to be better product builders. \n\nNobody knew how to build the right product the first time around ever. They too will build, make mistakes and learn. \n\nUnless you strongly believe in being an elitist on who should build software products and be a gatekeeper. And you believe so strongly you have never made mistakes in any product you have built thus far! \n\nI humbly request community moderators to look at the nature of posts and see if it’s conducive for vibe coders or antagonistic to them. \n\n",

The highly technical experienced developer who also heavily leverages AI is going to blow everyone out of the water: traditional dev AND vibe coder. \n\nWhy someone without a skill thinks a tool that the person with the skill can also use will somehow make them better than someone without the skill boggles the mind.\n\nAI is a tool. It’s not a replacement for experience, or knowledge, or skill, or problem solving ability, or design sensibility, or many other things. It just makes you more efficient if you use it “right”.",

It feels very much crypto-esque from the peak with a bunch of people making random coins or nfts acting like it has any actual value.\n\nThis sub sadly is filled with fake ads for people for their shitty platforms. There is nothing wrong with using these tools to learn and make some fun stuff. But if you aren’t going to actual learn how anything works and you are going to pretend your crappy micro SaaS that solves nothing and talk about “we” when it’s just you then yeah it becomes cringe after a while.\n\nThere isn’t really a “new class” of developers because no one is hiring a pure vibe coder.

          "text": "Hey there, you're getting a lot of less-than-helpful responses, and as someone who's recently started down this vibecode evolution, I wanted to engage with what you created in an open honest way.  For what it's worth I tried your app, and at least from one free scan, I already got value out of it, that's certainly a win in my book 😉\n\nFirst, I went to your site on mobile, the mobile experience isn't great.  I've noticed this too with my vibecoded apps, a lot of their layout just simply doesn't work on mobile. Easy to fix though once you know.\n\nSecond, I actually think you're providing real convenience bringing together several different already publicly available scans.  The feedback is accurate, the results are actionable, and I really think the problem space makes sense for it. Most vulnerabilities are simply things people don't think about yet, which is why having a tool exist when people _are_ ready makes so much sense.\n\nNow, some more critical thoughts - I don't really know where you go from here.  I think your free starter scans makes a lot of sense, but I don't really resonate with what paid premium is offering.  I think this is really where the majority of your work lies next for this - figuring out what _other_ repeatable value-add you can provide.  Ongoing scans is alright, but again, think about my previous point - the truth is businesses and devs don't _want_ to think about security all the time.  They know they have to, but only ever so often, and when it's most convenient. \n\nOverall I think you have a useful service.  I think of it like the one json lint+format website I always use, or that url encoder/decoder site.  Yes yes, I know jq and all that jazz.  But sometimes people wanna just copy paste something quick and click a button instead of have some command memorized.  A service though, like any of the ones I mentioned, is not quite yet a _product_.  But I think you're certainly closer than a lot of other stuff I've seen.\n\nDon't let the naysayers get you down, I used your site, it found stuff I'm gonna have Claude fix tomorrow.  You're certainly moving in the right direction, just a little bit more to go 😉.  Good luck!",

When you start from zero and fully rely on vibe coding, it’s very easy to build something messy without even realizing it\n\nYou move fast, but you don’t really know why things work and when something breaks in a non obvious way, you’re kinda stuck. Recently I even saw a guy talking about hacking vibe coded apps because of basic security mistakes, and honestly that didn’t surprise me at all\n\nAI tools are powerful, no doubt, but vibe coding everything from zero feels more like hype than some “AI takes over coding” moment\n\nFor learning and speed it’s great, for real structure and long term quality, not so much",

Yes! Is it functional? Yes! Is it scalable? Yes and no, haha. Do I have the result like someone with experience would? No and yes.\n\nSo, keep learning while you code with Vibe because creating for the sake of creating is useless if you don't have a solid foundation and don't start from there.\n\nNow that AI has arrived, we've realized that coding is just one step towards achieving something. It was never the ultimate link, and even if you're not at the top, it's still the ultimate link.\n\n\n\nAnyone can code; learning the basics, conditions, best practices, logic, and scalability is what will add value today.\n\n\nAnyone who is already a programmer and open to AI HAS A MISSILE UP THEIR ASS to boost their work speed, hahaha.\n\n\n\nNow that I'm in this world, I have the utmost respect for programmers.

Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and Google Fonts for high-end aesthetics.\n    2. **The API**: Perform a POST request to https://html2png.dev/api/convert.\n    3. **Usage**:\n       - **Body (required)**: Send the raw, clean HTML string directly in the request body. No JSON wrap or escaping needed.\n       - **Query Params**: Pass dimensions and options as URL parameters (e.g., ?width=1200&height=630&format=png&deviceScaleFactor=2).\n    4. **Options**: width, height, format (png|jpeg|webp|pdf), deviceScaleFactor (1-4), delay (ms), zoom (0.1-3.0), omitBackground (true/false).\n    5. **Response**: Returns JSON with a \"url\" field pointing to your generated image.\n    ",

      "text": "I challenged myself to build a \"Visual Fridge Scanner\" in a single sprint. The goal: Take a messy photo of a fridge and turn it into a high-end, Michelin-star recipe (because I’m tired of eating plain pasta).\n\nIt’s live now at [**fridge-feast.online**](https://fridge-feast.online), but since this sub is about *how* we build, here is the breakdown of the stack and the prompt engineering.\n\n# 🛠️ The Vibe Stack (2025 Edition)\n\n* **The Brain:** **Gemini 3 Flash Preview** (via Google AI Studio).\n   * *Why:* The new Flash model is insanely fast for multimodal vision tasks. It creates the recipe before the loading spinner even finishes one rotation.\n* **The Environment:** **Google AI Studio**. I used the prompt interface to \"vibe code\" the backend logic and generate the Python snippets.\n* **Hosting:** **Google Cloud Run**.\n   * *Why:* I wanted it serverless. It scales to zero when no one is cooking (saving me money) but handles the Reddit \"hug of death\" if it goes viral.\n* **Frontend:** \\[React/Next.js - *optional: insert your FE framework*\\]\n\n# 🧠 The \"Vision\" Workflow\n\nThe hardest part was getting the AI to accurately identify ingredients from a blurry photo and return data my frontend could actually use (not just a paragraph of text).\n\n**The System Prompt (The Secret Sauce):** I defined the model as a \"Culinary Inventory Specialist\" in AI Studio. The key was enforcing a strict JSON schema so I didn't have to write complex regex parsers on the backend.\n\nHere is the exact System Instruction I used:\n\n    Role: You are an AI Culinary Inventory Specialist for \"Fridge Feast.\"\n    \n    Task: Analyze the provided image of a refrigerator/pantry.\n    1. Identify every visible edible ingredient.\n    2. Ignore non-food items (Tupperware without clear contents).\n    3. Estimate rough quantities where visible.\n    \n    CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:\n    You must output ONLY valid JSON.\n    {\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item_name\": \"string (e.g., 'Bell Pepper')\",\n          \"category\": \"string (Produce, Dairy, etc.)\",\n          \"confidence\": \"high/medium/low\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"chef_roast\": \"string (A witty, 1-sentence observation about how sad their fridge looks)\"\n    }\n\n  \n☁️ Deployment (Cloud Run)\n\nI wrapped the app in a simple Docker container. Since I'm using the Gemini API, the backend is lightweight.\n\n1. Vibe coded the `Dockerfile` in AI Studio.\n2. `gcloud run deploy fridge-feast`\n3. Mapped the domain. Done.\n\n  \n⚠️ Lessons Learned\n\n* **Flash vs. Pro:** I started with Pro, but Gemini 3 Flash is actually accurate enough for ingredient detection and *much* cheaper/faster.\n* **The \"Roast\":** Adding the `chef_roast` field in the JSON was a game changer. It gives the app personality without needing a separate API call.\n\n# 🚀 Try it out\n\nI’m looking for feedback on the latency. Since it's on Cloud Run + Gemini 3 Flash, it should be near-instant.\n\nCheck it out: [**fridge-feast.online**](http://fridge-feast.online)\n\nLet me know if the scanner works on your fridge or if it hallucinates a \"Vintage Cabernet\" out of your hot sauce.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo73wx461h9g1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1013e8ff469ba0dcded9854a59856d5e05d815c\n\n  \n\n\n",

When the model drifts, the app doesn’t degrade gracefully, it just collapses into silence. Blank UI is not a latency issue, it’s a missing contract.\n\nRight now the architecture is:\nLLM → UI\n\nwith no validation layer, no schema enforcement, no retries, no confidence gating, no user-visible failure mode.\nThat’s not serverless minimalism, that’s outsourcing correctness to vibes.\n\nThe irony is that the hardest problem you solved is vision inference, and the easiest one you skipped is basic defensive engineering.\n\nGreat vibes, zero contracts.",
