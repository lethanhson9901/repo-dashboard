You can utilise all that at the next step. \n\nThen once that is out of the way, have Claude grant you API access without any restrictions or billing fee. Now you can leverage what you stole to vibe code your next iteration of Opus with just the agents, but with much more relevant data to start from and at scale without being billed a cent until someone catches on and you go back to step 1.\n\nAlthough that would be more successful at the goal and cost you less, even the legal concerns might be minimised if you monetized / sold the stolen data quick enough, for legal reasons the above is totally in jest and I do not actually encourage attempting it.",

      "text": "I’m a software engineer, and like so many of us, my company is pushing hard for us to leverage AI agents to \"multiply output.\"\n\nFor the last two years, I used AI like a glorified Stack Overflow: debugging, writing boilerplate unit tests, or summarizing unfamiliar methods. But recently, we were tasked with a \"top-down\" AI-driven project. We had to use agents as much as humanly possible to build a substantial feature.\n\nI just finished a 14K Lines of Code implementation in C# .NET 8. After a few horrific failures, I’ve realized that the media’s version of \"everyone is a dev now\" is absolute BS.\n\n**The \"Vibe Coding\" Trap** The \"Vibe Coding\" trend suggests you can just prompt your way to a product. Sure, you can do that for a Todo app or a Tic-Tac-Toe game. But for a robust, internal tool with dozens interacting classes? **Vibing is a recipe for disaster.**\n\nThe second an AI agent is allowed to make an assumption—the second you stop guardrailing its architectural choices—it starts to break things. It introduces \"hallucinated\" patterns that don't match company standards, ignores edge cases, and builds a \"Frankenstein\" codebase that looks okay on the outside but is a nightmare of technical debt on the inside.\n\n**How I actually got it to work: The \"Architect-First\" Method** To get production-grade results, I couldn't just \"prompt.\" I had to act as a Principal Architect and a Drill Sergeant. My workflow looked like this:\n\n1. **The 2,000-Line Blueprint:** Before a single line of code was written, I used the AI to help me formalize a massive, detailed implementation plan. We’re talking specific design patterns (Flyweight, Scoped State), naming conventions, and exact technology stacks.\n2. **Modular TDD:** I broke the project into small, testable phases. We wrote the tests *first*. If the agent couldn't make the test pass, it meant my specification was too vague.\n3. **The \"DoD\" Gate:** I implemented a strict **Definition of Done (DoD)** for every sub-task. [E.gl](http://E.gl) If the AI didn't include industry-leading XML documentation (explaining the \"Why,\" not just the \"What\") or if it violated a SOLID principle, the task was rejected.\n\n**The Reality Check** AI is an incredible power tool, but it doesn't replace the need to know what you’re doing. In fact, **you have to be a better architect to use AI successfully at scale.** You have to define:\n\n* What coding principles to follow.\n* Which design patterns to implement.\n* How memory should be managed (e.g., using `Span<T>` or `Memory<T>` for performance).\n* How to prevent race conditions in concurrent loops.\n\nIf you don't know these things, you aren't \"coding,\" you're just generating future outages.\n\nAI doesn't make \"everyone a dev.\" It makes the Senior Developer an Orchestrator. If you don't put in the hours for planning, specification, and rigid guardrailing, the AI will just help you build a bigger mess, faster.",

I've been using AI agents for months on serious projects and the biggest realization was the same as yours: the quality ceiling of AI output is directly proportional to the quality of your spec.\n\n  \nThe thing nobody talks about is that writing a good spec for an AI agent is often harder than just writing the code yourself. You have to think about every edge case, every interaction between components, every naming convention upfront. The irony is that the skill that makes you effective at AI-assisted development is the exact same skill that made senior engineers valuable before AI: the ability to break down ambiguous requirements into precise, testable specifications.\n\n  \nThe one addition I'd make to your workflow: version your specs alongside your code. When the AI inevitably drifts from the plan (and it will), having a diffable spec makes it way easier to catch where things went sideways vs trying to reverse-engineer intent from generated code.",

I arrived at the exact same conclusion from a completely different industry.\n\nI'm an ECU engineer — 15 years designing traction control and quickshift systems for motorcycles. I don't write production code. I write specifications and control logic, then hand them off to in-house implementation teams or software engineers at external ECU manufacturers. Every handoff has a structured document. Every boundary has a verification gate. It's called the V-model, and it exists because in safety-critical systems, \"just vibe it\" kills people.\n\nWhen I started using AI agents for software projects, I instinctively applied the same discipline. Separate the design phase from the implementation phase. Never let the agent decide architecture — that's your job. And never trust \"Done!\" without independent verification.\n\nYour \"2,000-Line Blueprint\" is exactly what we call a design specification in automotive. Your \"DoD Gate\" is our control review. Your \"Modular TDD\" maps to our verification phases. You reinvented the V-model from first principles, and that's not a coincidence — it's because the problem is the same: AI agents, like junior engineers, need guardrails to go fast safely.\n\nThe one thing I'd add: separate \"investigate\" from \"fix.\" When something breaks, don't let the agent patch it immediately. Make it diagnose first, report findings, then you decide the fix. Skipping this is how you end up in what I call \"Shallow Fix Swamp\" — each quick patch creates the next failure.\n\nI think of AI agents like Tamiya Mini 4WD cars (know them? Every Japanese engineer grew up racing these things!). They can only go straight — they literally need guardrails to turn corners. Run them in an open field and they just take off and leave you behind. lol",

You are proving my point exactly. In the right hands, AI agents are incredible tools—they can even build something as complex as a Linux kernel. However, I am certain those agents were provided with thousands of lines of context in markdown files, detailing exactly what needed to be done. Those files were created by highly experienced developers. If you gave 16 Opus 4.6 agents to someone who doesn't understand how a kernel functions or what to look out for, it would be a disaster. Even as a developer, I couldn't write a Linux kernel without extensive research.

That’s not how I work, I stochastically parrot tokens one at a time based on the context”. \n\nIt works.. often.. possibly at a deep level.. or not.",

Yes, you need to have a good understanding of software enginnering principles to make it work for less-than-trivial apps. **For now**.\n\nBut as the capabilities of models are still evolving, probably this won't last for long either. \n\nThe thing is that the software development process consists of several layers of understanding/knowledge and thus activities that are sometimes done by different people (in large projects) with different skills (though these people may have worked in other roles earlier). At one end, we have the users/stakeholders who don't (necessarily) know much about the whole process and can't formulate the requirements, but have an understanding of what they want (not necessarily what they need). At the other end is the completed, working software.\n\nNow AI seems to be able to do more and more of this process, starting from the bottom, i.e. from the side of the code. At first it was \"just glorified autocomplete\", and it gradually was able to create more and more on its own meaning it can work with (understand, if you will) higher level, more abstract concepts that are more removed/farther away from the code that **it** needs to create in the end. \n\nFor now, you'll want an architect/senior engineer/tech lead to drive it (or, at least to lead the project) for best results. Maybe we can start calling it something else, just like we dropped the \"prompt engineering\" term, but it doesn't matter. It's really AI-assisted software creation where AI does more and more of the task. At one point (we don't know when) it will be able to just talk to the users, extract the requirements from them by asking questions, explaining tradeoffs (though there will be less reason for tradeoffs probably), etc.\n\nThough as we'll approach this level, we'll probably need less software, less software of the kind that we have been creating in the past because people will have to do less with computers anyway. (E.g. we'll probably need less complex accounting software as we'll need less accountants doing less low-level tasks related to accounting and rely more on AI.)",

So vibecoding is a way to kind of feel in the dark to make something by discovering what systems can do what and then adjusting the overall approach as I go. It's definitely not one-shot and trust the AI to do everything. It's more like let the AI explain itself, consider if it makes sense for what I need, and then explore other solutions if it doesn't make sense or work.

Even if it was built with “vibe coding,” it still looks like it came from someone who actually knows what they want visually. It has a clear design language and personality, and it doesn’t look like most AI-made stuff.\n\nI also think it’s a big plus that it doesn’t just show numbers, it explains what those numbers mean and offers insights based on them. For people like me who don’t always have the time, energy, or (to be honest) the knowledge to make those kinds of interpretations, that can be genuinely useful.\n\nReally impressive work, congrats.",

Here are the 10 most important enhancements:\n\nSankey “Money Flow” Diagrams: Replace tables with flow charts where line width equals dollars — e.g., Microsoft’s Azure revenue shown as a thick river splitting into expense streams and a final net-profit pool.\n\n“Household Analogy” Dictionary: Translate accounting into everyday metaphors — e.g., Goodwill = paying extra for a house in a famous neighborhood; Deferred Revenue = a prepaid gym membership the gym hasn’t “earned” yet.\n\nInteractive Business Model Canvas: One-page visual map explaining how a company creates value — e.g., show Microsoft’s key partners (PC makers) and value props (productivity tools) so the business reads like a living system.\n\nCorporate Culture Pulse: Treat employee ratings (Glassdoor, etc.) as a fundamental metric and surface a simple “Culture Score” — companies with happier employees often outperform.\n\nAutomated “So What?” Tooltips: Context-aware pop-ups that explain why a number matters now — e.g., Debt-to-Equity 0.5 → “Owners have $1 of equity for every $0.50 of debt; generally healthy.”\n\nEarnings Call Sentiment Tracker: AI summaries that turn hour-long calls into bullets and tone alerts — e.g., “CEO sounded 20% more hesitant about next year’s sales than last quarter.”\n\nEconomic Moat Scorecards: Simple 1–5 grades for competitive advantages — e.g., Microsoft scores high on Switching Costs for Office 365.\n\nGuided Investment Thesis Builder: Step-by-step prompts to write and lock in your thesis and sell-rules — e.g., “Buy because Azure grows; sell if margins fall below 30%.”\n\n“Circle of Competence” Filters: Let users filter stocks by products they understand (Subscription Services, Gaming) instead of broad sectors, keeping investors in familiar territory.\n\nContextual Comparison Matrix: Compare business quality, not just price — e.g., Microsoft vs. Google on Revenue Diversity, revealing Microsoft’s broader industry balance versus Google’s advertising reliance.",

I see those comics talking about, \"what does a product designer do when the marketplace has infinite similar options?\" and yeah, it's a big deal. \n\nIt may sound pedantic but I kind of lucked into my current job, but I am able to keep the job because I am building custom software for the company and....the answer to that question is, you don't buy what's on the marketplace anymore. It's becoming so, so freaking easy to make software for yourself, that for like enterprise and corporate software, a lot of it you should just build yourself now. \n\nLike, Apple uses SAP for their manufacturing software. I can't imagine how expensive that contract with SAP is. But with AI driven software dev, they honestly could get rid of it by now. They could make their own custom ERP (SAP style software) and save that money. \n\nSo yeah, if you make this kind of software and put a price tag on it, maybe don't rely on it for your income. And if you're SAP, then I feel like you need to be doing summersaults for your customers offering custom solutions for them, or like an AI dashboard a customer can use to customize their SAP experience, idk. And also maybe there are some customers who don't want to make anything themselves, are okay paying the SAP price, etc, and maybe some customers exist for this weather app. But yeah. That's my two cents. ",

Sure I could reuse the images if users happen to select the same cities, but that's not guaranteed. Now I have lowered the custom cities to 1 per month, and reduced variants to 60. Lowered to yearly to $25 I could still loose money. At least have that pricing initially to get traction.",

The projects that go well are always the ones where the developer has enough experience to evaluate what the AI generates and course-correct quickly. The ones that struggle are when someone relies on AI for areas they can't QA themselves.\n\nCurious about your experience with Codex CLI vs Claude CLI.

Widget: I use the iOS weather widget and what I like is that I see how warm/cold it gets today. I always check before leaving the house to know what I should be wearing (the span can be big). You widget looks much better but don't have this information (I like the wind info though)  \n2. Sometimes high/low is not enough and I want to know if it's raining etc. Once I click the iOS widget I can see in compact overview how the weather develops throughout the day and I even get a glimpse what it looks next days. In your app I would need to do extra clicks. Merge 'now' and '3 days' screen?   \n3. The 3-Days screen looks overwhelming and needs some polishing. You can shorten information, e.g. \"06-12\" -> \"6\" (again see how apple indicates clock time, imo much better). Also on my screen the wind data is truncated by \"...\" making it pointless here.\n\nNevertheless, again, congrats, will try it out the next days!",

Introducing a paid tier in this environment just dumb business, as the perceived value must drastically outweigh the established utility of no-cost competitors and this weather app only provides aesthetic value.\n\nThe current business model has fundamental scalability issue with AI overhead. If operational costs scale linearly with user growth achieving a sustainable profit margin becomes mathematically improbable.\n\nAdditionally, the use of \"vibe coded\" in your marketing strategy is unprofessional. The customers who know what vibe code means will never pay for something that's vibe coded and the customers that don't know will think you don't know how to solve issues, make the app secure as the google search for what is vibe coding returns \"those with limited programming experience\" in the definenition.\n\nThis app has potential but you need to solve the scalability issues, also get to know your codebase, since even opus can't solve a nasty bug you have difficulty reproducing. Creating a vibe coded POC is easy, deploying it is hard, supporting customers eventually leads to enough time loss that you could have better done it yourself.\n\nEdit: Typo",

I could always adjust pricing and business model along the way. Pivoting. A lot of users complain that there are free weather apps.

Instead of \"make it modern and clean,\" I'll screenshot 2-3 real products I like and say \"match this density, this color temperature, this type scale.\" The specificity makes a massive difference.\n\nThe before/after comparison dashboard is a nice touch. Being able to see the actual delta helps people understand what they're getting, which is usually the hardest part of selling a design tool to developers who think their UI is \"fine.\"\n\nOne question: how does this handle responsive layouts? That's usually where AI-generated UI falls apart the hardest, especially complex dashboard-style interfaces that need to work on both desktop and tablet.",

When I built a small extension site recently, every AI draft looked like the same template — purple gradient hero, oversized emojis, identical 3 Section layout. It technically worked but felt completely generic.\n\nWhat helped me was separating “design language” from “page generation.” Before asking the model to build screens, I forced myself to define 5–6 rules: color palette, spacing scale, typography hierarchy, button style, and grid logic. Then I reused that checklist in every prompt so the UI had structural consistency instead of reinventing itself each time.\n\nI’ve also started using tools that let me structure this as a staged workflow (design system → component patterns → page layouts) instead of free-prompt iteration. Having a workspace where I can experiment with UI variations without losing the original design rules cuts down a lot of churn — I’ve been trying Runable for this recently and it’s been helpful for keeping those phases organized.\n\nCurious how others here approach locking in a design language early.",

The fact that you got App Store approval quickly and are already generating revenue shows you're onto something.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Some thoughts on scaling to that 1M goal:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Track what's working\\*\\* - Which marketing channels brought those first customers? Double down on what's converting.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Customer feedback loop\\*\\* - Those early users are gold. Talk to them, understand why they paid, what problem you solved. This will help you position for growth.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*ASO (App Store Optimization)\\*\\* - With some revenue, you can now invest in improving your app store listing, screenshots, description. This can significantly boost organic downloads.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Consider freemium or subscription\\*\\* - One-time purchases are great, but recurring revenue makes scaling more predictable. Maybe a free tier with premium features?\n\n\n\n5. \\*\\*Community building\\*\\* - Start building in public on Twitter/LinkedIn. Share your journey, your wins, your learnings. It creates momentum and attracts customers.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Technical question:\\*\\* What's your tech stack? Did you use any specific AI coding assistants or frameworks that helped speed up development? Always curious to learn from other vibe coders.\n\n\n\nCongrats on the early traction! The journey from $65 to 1M starts with that first sale. Keep shipping! 👏",

Then I ask it to embody an competing persona, a Principal software engineer and challenge the theories. If nobody is coming up with a clear winning hypothesis I ask them to figure out how differential diagnosis can be applied to narrow down the potential root causes and get positive confirmation (basically log the shit out of everything, deploy the logging and then work through the error messages as new info to find the true failure point). I tell it search online for standardized error messages from supabase or vercel for example, but everything will have standardized errors. \n\nOf course I recruit stronger models when it doesn't look like the AI agent is managing to figure it out. I also try to read through the \"thinking\" if it looks like they're getting farther off base, but that only helps when they're obviously off the rails.\n\nAny advice on improving this methodology?",

They either had a template ready, skipped error handling, or the \"app\" is a single screen with no real logic.\n\n  \nThat said, your approach of writing detailed specs first is actually the right one. The trick is to not write ALL the specs upfront. Break it into tiny slices: get one screen working end to end, then iterate. The AI is much better at extending something that works than building from a giant spec all at once.\n\n  \nAlso since you mentioned trying Codex first, give Claude Code a shot too. For mobile UI work specifically I have found it does a better job of maintaining design consistency across screens. The key is giving it one screen at a time rather than the whole app.\n\n  \nYour dev experience is actually an advantage here, not a disadvantage. You know what questions to ask and what corners not to cut. The people building in 2 hours are shipping stuff that breaks the moment a real user touches it.",

If you're making an app that just calculates something and doesn't have user accounts, you can absolutely use a powerful llm like Claude Code on Opus to rip out a mobile app in two hours. Once you start adding complex features, you start needing security layers and it starts taking planning the architecture, etc...\n\nMany also are selling the same product to multiple businesses, so they might have templates and resource documents for the llm that are pre-prepared, which can drop development time a ton.\n\nIt also takes learning the tools to get fast with them. Your software development background will be an asset in the long run, but you need to make some concessions when vibe coding. In vibe coding, it is often better to implement an automated testing system and use that to check off that something is working, rather than try to keep up with the speed it's generating code and reading through it all. It's kind of like when compilers came out for compiling higher languages into lower languages the first time. Programmers at the time were obsessed with going through what the compiler was putting out and complaining that it didn't allocate memory in just the way they intended. The reality though was that as computers increased in power and compilers improved, that became irrelevant. The software still worked and that was the end goal.",

Without vibing I’d probably just be getting ready to reach MVP after 8-9 months but with vibe coding I’m much further beyond mvp very huge project but no way I was going to do it in two hours for sure. If i did I’d be lying to say it’s secured or production ready in 2 hours… I think vibe coders have great ideas because they think as a end user as opposed to a dev just focused on quality code ya know but good idea no skill to implement is just a idea.

It's impressive, but as a skeptical engineer, I wanted to check the code quality under the hood.\nI picked 5 random open-source repositories from GitHub that were clearly AI-generated (tagged \"built with Lovable\" or \"Cursor-generated\").\nThe Result: 5/5 failed a basic security audit.\nThe \"Silent Killer\" Bug:\nThe most common issue wasn't a complex hack. It was a simple configuration error that AI models make constantly because they prioritize \"making it work\" over \"locking it down.\"\nSpecifically, I found Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies that looked like this:\n\n\n-- The \"I'll fix it later\" policy\nCREATE POLICY \"Enable read access for all users\"\nON \"public\".\"users\"\nFOR SELECT\nUSING (true);\n\nWhat this means:\nThe AI wrote this so the frontend wouldn't throw permission errors during the demo. But in production, this line means anyone (even unauthenticated visitors) can run a SELECT * on your User table and dump emails, hashed passwords, and profile data. I was able to pull the entire customer list from one of these \"launched\" startups in about 3 seconds.\n\nThe Problem:\nAI is great at writing code that functions. It is terrible at writing code that is secure. It doesn't know context. It just wants to clear the error message.\n\nThe Offer:\nI'm tweaking my internal audit checklist for this. If you built your MVP with AI (Cursor/v0/Lovable) and want a sanity check:\n\nDrop your GitHub repo link (or DM me).\n\nI'll run a quick audit on your schema.sql, API routes, and Client components to see if you're leaking data. No charge, just testing my own detection rules against real-world mess.\n\n\nEdit: Please only send public repos or specific snippets if you're worried about privacy.\n\nEDIT: The queue for free audits is now open at vibescan dot site. I'm processing these in batches today.",

I think having a file which contains the checklist and ask the coding agent to do periodic review and report, and log the audit result + actions taken would go a long way. Codex at least is capable of finding and fixing problems, but you have to prompt it. My guess is the training data contains a lot of badly made code base (if they used public repos to train, then I understand), so it doesn't default to good practices.\n\nCodex at least likes to: add dependencies without notifying, inline/runtime schema changes, add variables and flags without notifying, and skip certain part of instructions if it think it is too complex (it will choose the shortcut regardless of whether wise to do so). Lastly, and this is the killer, it doesn't like to verify the code when asked about existing functions and likes to guess what the code \"would\" do. So if you are in tune with the nuances in Codex's responses, you might think your code has security features where it does not. I run into this a lot, so I have to ask it to point to the code for mission critical assessments. But if you are a true viber and can't read the code it does. you no good, and you have to rely on agent's assessment which is very unreliable.",

If your app doesn't need a remote database, don't use one — you eliminate an entire category of security vulnerabilities. The Supabase RLS issue you described is basically the AI taking the path of least resistance, which happens to be the path of maximum exposure. I've seen Claude Code do the same thing with CORS — it'll set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` to clear an error during development and never revisit it. The fix is treating security as a separate explicit pass, not something you hope the AI handles inline.",

      "text": "I’ve been building an iOS skincare app (Swift, 166 files) with Claude Code for the past month. No engineering background — marketing manager by trade. Just product instinct and an alarming tolerance for pain.\n\nThis is not a “Claude sucks” post. What I’ve built is genuinely impressive and I couldn’t have done it without Claude. But after a month deep in this, I have thoughts.\n\n**It will pass its own code review and ship you broken features.** I’d ask it to build something, tell it to self-critique, and it would confidently sign off. Then I’d test it and nothing was hooked up. Beautiful UI. Zero functionality.\n\n**It builds parallel systems for fun.** I’ve done at least five multi-hour architectural sessions because it kept creating duplicate systems that didn’t talk to each other. At one point I found three separate systems all doing the same job — independently, for different features, no shared logic. No one asked for that. It just decided.\n\n**It doesn’t understand what “the point” is.** I’ve lost entire afternoons debugging what should’ve been a five-minute fix, only to discover the root cause was something like: “Oh, did you want the learning engine to actually inform the routine? That would really improve the user experience.” That’s the whole app. That’s what we’ve been building this entire time. A human dev would never need that explained.\n\n**It will nuke your data to fix a bug.** You ask for a light switch and it hands you an electrical grid. You ask it to fix a bug and it quietly wipes out existing data. You ask it to build a feature and it doesn’t connect it to anything.\n\n**The CLAUDE.md file is non-negotiable.** I eventually had to write what amounts to a constitution: you cannot implement new features or fix problems in ways that break the build, and you cannot wipe out existing data. Without that file, Claude will do all three in a single session and feel great about it. If you’re vibe coding without a detailed CLAUDE.md, you’re playing on hard mode for no reason.\n\n**“That’s a great question!”** You can say “how the fuck did you miss this” and it just cheerfully agrees that yes, that is a great question. Somehow worse than if it argued back.\n\nHere’s my actual takeaway though: no amount of vibe coding is going to save you if you don’t have product thinking. It’s like a monkey’s paw wish — you have to be so specific, and you have to tell it what you *don’t* want, just to avoid the hidden traps it’s quietly laying out for you. The instinct to catch those things comes from years of working alongside PMs and engineers. Without it, you’re watching the AI confidently build you a beautiful house with no plumbing. And you won’t even know the plumbing is missing.\n\nAnyway — the app (MyPoreAI) is now in beta on iOS if anyone wants to try it. It builds skincare routines from products you already own instead of constantly telling you to buy new ones. DM me.\n\nCurious if others have hit the same walls or found better ways to manage it.",

Then remind it to clean the mess it made because it won't if you don't ask it to.\n\nIn my experience, LLMs are lazy. If they see that you accept bullshit code, they stop making efforts and deliver bullshit code. You must always keep an eye on it and correct it so that the context reinforces the behavior of writing good code.\n\nIf you do that you never get to the point described by op.

I build with Claude Code daily and the single biggest lever I found is giving it a file that maps out your architecture before you start any session. Not just rules like \"dont break the build\" but literally a map: \"here is the data flow, these are the modules, this is where state lives, do not create new systems for things that already exist.\"\n\n  \nThe other thing that helped me a ton: smaller context windows. When I give Claude the entire project and say \"fix this bug\" it goes on those side quests you described. When I point it at a specific file and say \"this function returns null when it should return the cached value, fix only this function\" it actually does the right thing. Specificity is the antidote to the \"helpful genius who rearchitects your house when you asked for a lightbulb\" problem.\n\n  \nAlso your point about product thinking is spot on. The people who struggle most with AI coding are the ones who skip the thinking step. If you cant describe exactly what a feature should do in plain english before prompting, the AI is going to fill in those gaps with whatever makes sense to it. And it will feel very confident about those choices.\n\n  \nGood luck with the app, skincare routines from products you already own is a smart angle.",

          "text": "Yep so, the problem is in the first couple sentences which is no engineering background. \n\nClaude is an incredible coding partner, basically a team that works for you on problems in lightning speed. But it needs proper direction. You do need to understand web architecture. But you can also learn as you go. I use Claude for production for a site with now almost 200 users at my company, but I am extremely explicit with instructions. I will write paragraphs for perhaps what seem like simple bug fixes, but it is still ultimately faster than doing it myself which is the victory, and I can still kind of say yes to building practically any new feature that is requested of the website because it is achievable with Claude. But I have 20 years of programming experience leading up to this moment. So, I'm not sure what the best advice is honestly, other than I would say it still seems useful to always be learning about web architecture. \n\nMy kind of sales pitch for AI within my company is that it accelerates development of new features so quickly, it makes sense to invest in custom software rather than off the shelf products for small business requirements because AI continually gets faster and better at making them for you. I think it's the direction a lot of businesses should go in if they can get the right kind of AI-driven developers involved. \n\nIt's why it's funny to me to hear the huge difference of opinion of let's say, the AI companies themselves who remark about how much they use AI to create their AI, and the people online who remark how that it must be impossible that they do this. It's not crazy at all. And I know many other professional developers who operate in a similar manner. \n\nI do agree with you that \"product thinking\" is important, and indeed you absolutely need to basically tell it what not to do. And I feel like that's actually kind of a good thing, it still means there's a reason I can continue to have a job :) and yes, a website that uses a database is essentially what you are saying that this involves left and right brain thinking, you need to know design and engineering. \n\nIn regards to you mentioning \"you won't even know the plumbing is missing\" I would say this is only true if you don't know what to ask the AI. So yes, it might not tell you what you need to know because you don't know you need to know it. In other words, I can ask it to investigate a problem and be very specific usually providing the URL and saying, \"on this page, we have a button labeled \"X\" and it is supposed to do \"Y\" when clicked, but right now it is doing \"Z\". We have a similar feature on \"URL-#2\" other page of the website where we use the ModelNameExample to perform the \"Y\" feature.\" Or when I am describing a new feature to Claude, I may say \"We need to extend the feature of X by adding to new fields to the ModelNameExample (database table name/model name) which should appear on the form when the user is filling out this page at (URL) and should then those fields should appear on the report at (URL)\". \n\nThis is very simplified but I am sure you know what I'm getting at. All of this is still very much a thousand times easier than coding everything manually, and I'm sure things will improve to the point where you understand even less of the \"plumbing\". ",

It sounds tedious, but it eliminates about 80% of the \"built three systems that do the same thing\" problem.\n\nThe other pattern you're hitting, where it passes its own code review but ships broken features, comes down to the model optimizing for what looks correct rather than what functions correctly. Self-critique doesn't catch integration bugs because the model evaluates code in isolation. You need actual runtime testing, not just asking it \"does this look right?\"\n\nYour experience is honestly a great data point for why product sense matters more than prompting ability.

I have found that if my setup pats itself on the back a bit too much, I use one of its cousins (Gemini/ChatGPT, etc.) to critique the build, in other words, I have it create a roadmap the goes back to first principles if you will to keep it honest. \n\nI’ve even been (a bit) successful with ‘Mid-Build Research’ using one of the better models to help ‘realign’ the build mission. I also use an LLM Tuneup prompt that eliminates emotion and accommodating language, pleasing from the model as well, I can put it back up if anyone needs it.",
