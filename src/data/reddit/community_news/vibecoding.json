Wow, amazing!

Part of the problem with all these people vibe-coding their ideas is that they don't know what they don't know ***and the AI isn't going to tell them because it doesn't either***. \n\nIf I had a dollar for the number of times I've had to explain to a non-technical executive that they're asking for something that is just not technically possible, l'd be able to afford a very nice dinner out for me and my family. I get asked a lot less about these problems now, but I hear about how they're going to happen any day now, just as soon as they can work out how to make the AI understand the idea (as the code keeps not working for some reason).",

              "text": ">just jump right into your latest genius CRUD motivation tracker finance to-do app.\n\nThe To-Do App Critique Reveals the Critique's Own Poverty of Imagination\n\nYou're not wrong about the flood of motivation tracker finance to-do apps. But that says more about what problems the English-speaking tech-adjacent world thinks are worth solving than about vibe coding itself.\nHere's what you're missing from your app store vantage point:\n\nWhile you're mocking CRUD apps, someone in Bangalore can finally prototype a transparency system that surfaces bribery patterns in municipal contracts. A teacher in rural Nigeria who never learned syntax can now show exactly how an education delivery system should work. A motivated citizen can build a working demo of how road accident data should flow to actually save lives instead of disappearing into bureaucratic black holes.\n\nThe software industry had 40 years to solve these problems. They didn't. Why? Because children dying of diarrhea in India isn't a profitable market segment.\nVibe coding isn't about replacing senior engineers at Google. It's about giving the prototype pen to the people who actually see the problems—and have been locked out by syntax gatekeeping and software budgets.\nYour critique assumes the only valid apps are the ones that make it to the App Store for Western consumers. That's not a defense of quality. That's a confession of tunnel vision.\n\nThe condescension from devs was never quality control. It was a bottleneck on human imagination. Good riddance.",

Of course, technology (specifically coding languages) is evolved. \nConsidering that, I am not even good at prompting because I don't know how it should actually be done. Giving business requirements is definitely not working. For me, LLM works best when prompts are precise. \nFor example, I caught it with dependency injection (despite clear instructions) and hashing (again clear instructions), it just simply apologized and asked me if I wanted to do that. \n\nNow, I can't understand the complete code structure and I find it risky to put something like this on prod and charge money for services it offers",

Some are empty for obvious reasons.\n* You can now share a specific channel via a direct URL. (Added a share button on right top of stream screen)\n* Added the channel's country logo to the channel info tag.\n* Added a CORS error warning, as it is not something I'm able to solve without paying a fortune to proxies.",

I just dealt with this while building a secure web player for an OTT provider client. The options were a PHP proxy, which eats up workers fast as you grow, an NGINX setup, which is the better route, or if you’re feeling bold, using Cloudflare Workers until they shut you down for handling streaming traffic.\n\nI am ALL EARS if someone has a better option.",

You don’t want to unexpectedly hit cost limits, request-per-second caps, or provider quotas. It also helps protect against bad actors using your app as a proxy. Adding alerts when usage approaches a limit would be a nice touch and relatively easy to implement.\n\nContent safety (possibly overkill, but relevant):\n\nSince the app seems mainly focused on kids, you might consider sending the generated result to another LLM (image-to-text) for moderation checks (sexual content, inappropriate text, etc.). Even if you already restrict this in your prompt, a creative user can bypass it. You can’t prevent everything, but you can make a best effort.\n\nAdditional input methods & accessibility:\n\nI added speech support to the UI using the Web Speech API. This allows not only image-based input but also speech-to-image flows. In this case, you’d also need to secure against prompt injection.\n\nPossible flows could be:\n\nspeech → doodle → AI image\n\nspeech → AI image\n\nspeech → style → applied to a doodle\n\nNot all kids are great painters, and having worked with children with disabilities, I think offering multiple input options is important.\n\nGood luck!!",

It also has a book which explains the basic stuff. I am the same as you experienced dev but no hardware exp so the book was quite helpful\n\nEdit: Be wary though, it is so fun that I got a box full of electronics at home now that is full of components used in past prototyping/having fun projects :p like led strips, microphones, various sensors, cables, solder, breadboards, a few arduinos, a few pi picos, etc. lol",

Then tell it to triage to GitHub issues, use milestones and labels, add Google Jules for long running low cost background kick-off, and create a lovely mad cascade where merges to main cause codebase curation and issue triage and more PR review and set yourself a fun little challenge.

It's still just reimplementing things that already exist but in, probably, a worse way. \n\nI think a really cool follow up post for you would be to have AI analyze existing popular operating systems and try to identify limitations or pain points. Then try to have it address those in your OS implementation. Basically work together with it to try and come up with a truly novel OS, architecture, or paradigm in how OSs work or should be used.

      "text": "I have been experimenting with vibecoding for a few months now with GPT and Claude. I have extensive programming experience so I'm good at reading code and understanding how it works and how different pieces come together. I have that shit down pat.\n\nI have been giving ChatGPT and Claude firm instructions on what requirements I have and asking it to work within those requirements. The code almost never works on the first try if it's a complex request but refining the prompts fixes it, but the real danger is when the code seems to work but has logic flaws or security vulnerabilities. \n\nReviewing the code, it often becomes clear the LLMs don't have a full understanding of how the different pieces work together. For example, I recently had an issue that BOTH Claude and GPT couldn't fix until I found what the issue was and told them how to fix it.\n\nThere was a call from a render loop which would get the loading percentage from the background process which was doing the loading. There was another variable for load completion being set to true by the background thread, on the background thread, which would stop the background thread from continuing to run after it hit 100%. The problem was that this was happening before the render loop could read that it was at 100% so the loading never got flagged as complete on the render thread. In situations like this one both Claude and GPT completely failed to debug the problem because they couldn't understand the context. I had to specifically tell them what the problem was and how to fix it.\n\nI really think the issue with AI code is how people will use it without knowing how to read code so they won't know if the output is any good or not.\n\nAt the end of the day, to an experienced programmer, AI ends up just being an overhyped form of auto complete. It speeds things up but relying on it for debugging or generating complex projects for now is still a fools errand.\n\nThose are just my thoughts I'm open to changing my view but I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\n\n ",

The trick is to get a fairly detailed idea put together, then give that outline as a .md to Claude opus 4.5 in plan mode or gpt5.2-high, and then ask it to create a detailed PRD from the outline and break up the workflow into tasks that will be executed by ai agents. Include tests for every step. \n\nYou will end up with a bunch of quick and concise tasks that you can copy and paste into the prompt for cheaper agents to execute.  I like GLM-4.7 for that lately.  The agent will not stop until testing passes and then you move onto the next task.",

I was trying to learn python but ideas kept coming to me and I had no idea to implement them so I turned to vibe coding and I'm working on my own Augment clone. You could use Augments mcp in your various platforms too. Not here to advertise it. Augment is going down because they have messed up their pricing and made it similar to Cursor's, I feel sometimes that it is just taking the scenic route to use more credits. It is quite expensive because I use legacy pro which is 208000 credits but I've used 121000 in two days granted I did do some major work using Opus.

Eventually had a wake-up call that I was never going to be able to fix my fucked up GPA at this point so I might as well just pivot to business and focus (and did well from that point on).\n\nWith my only formal education being 2 years of comp sci (that I barely understood even back then), I had to play the game \"The Farmer Was Replaced\" to even learn the basics again. However, these vibe coding tools still enabled me to get what I want out of them.\n\nFor example, I don't know coding best practices, but I can ask the tool to review for those best practices and apply them. I don't know security best practices, but I can ask it to review for security. I don't know what I don't know so I can't even ask them to address it...so I ask it to red-team the proposed design and tell me what I don't know that I should be considering. I don't know how to avoid pitfalls in back-end architecture and race condition consideration etc. (never even heard of \"race conditions\"), but I asked it to think about it and it got back to me with proposals and then did it well enough. I don't know how to properly comment/document code but I asked it to do it anyway just in case.\n\nThere are situations where the AI can't figure out how to fix the bug, but I can ask it to provide me with a differential diagnosis strategy and work with me on it. I can ask other models or ask them to search online. These strategies all ended up working.\n\nAt the end of the day, the tools are doing what I expect them to. When I poke and prod them in testing, or use them for the intended purpose, it's able to address those things. So if for all intents and purposes it appears to work, that means it's fulfilling it's purpose.\n\nI'm not a coder by profession or even as a hobby, I work in FP&A (though I do have a PMP, the closest thing I get to code is SQL when dealing with ERP migration or planning software implementation from the product owner side), One thing that is common in FP&A is that you refine the business cases to be \"accurate enough\", then just go with it, because it's directionally accurate and precise enough to not change the conclusions that the decision relies upon, then just continuing to delay and refine the case to be perfect is delaying a decision that can have real impact and keeps us from moving on and dealing with the other decisions we haven't even started to analyze. In practical terms, I feel like these vibecoding tools align really well with the \"move fast and move on\" mentality that's required in my industry.\n\nI'll be getting more experienced at vibecoding, even if it isn't hands-on experience with code. If it means I keep getting useful results faster and more frequently, it won't make me an \"experienced programmer\", but it does mean the vibe coding doesn't \"suck\" because from a pragmatic perspective, if it works it works.",

They can't. Because they're missing the context of why it worked, who the actual users were, and how it was marketed. Building will most likely be the easier part in the future.

Are there any products available on the market that solves this? No? It doesn't exist, but all of our systems have an API layer and can interconnect to solve that problem? Can you recommend a solution for our scale and resources? Great.\n\nI have a small team of less than 5 devs and ops people. I have a total addressable market of the 30 people on my team. A 1 to 6 ratio is pretty good. Whereas some SaaS business out there is trying to solve for tens of thousands of customers. They will never build anything better than the in-house team at this point.\n\nSaaS products are approximate averages of the business problems that exist in the market. I can be surgical. I have context. I know exactly where our friction points are and the nuances of our problem set. I know John, I know Katie, I know Mariam. I know what they are good at. I know what makes them tick. I know what they respond to. I know the rate of turnover. I know the technical capability of our team. I know I can build a simple CLI tool for some people. I know I have to build UI's for others. And the AI generates perfect docs for all these in-house products. A SaaS will could never move like that.

A scene with a monster have: 1 video loop scene with monster, 2. video loop without the monster (win status), 3. transition to next scene, 4 animation combat and lose, 5. animation combat and win. So that is 5 videos per scene. 5 x10 scenes = 50 videos. lets say I made 100 videos (failed generations). So $70, plus cost of images, sound effects, music. So I guess the cost will be around $100.",

Take into account what you’ve learnt so far about generated video and gaming while making this and compare it to some of the game experiences that are out there today. \n\nFrom the looks of it, the platform seems more geared toward RPGs with a narrative/conversational play style and turn-based combat. This isn’t Elden Ring like but could be somewhat like a cross of Ace Attorney+Monster Hunters+Baldurs Gate.",

          "text": "I think for now (at least for the next few years) it'll be better to use it as a rendering layer on top of a simplistic world. Interactive video generation has issues with consistency if you turn around twice.\n\nThe other issue will be story progression. If you leave it up to an AI, it has a tendency to skip right to the end. For a lot of storyteller AIs, as soon as a character is preparing to go somewhere, the next paragraph has them already arriving at the destination. But for games, the gameplay loop exists in the path to get there.\n\nI would suggest building some sort of dungeon crawler that pre-generates a layout to keep things on the rails. Since you're generating video on the fly, you can leverage the strengths there by making the character freely defined by the player. They can describe the character they want, then some LLM backend builds the actions they have available based on a set of rules, and generates a reference asset and prompt for the video model to go off of.",
