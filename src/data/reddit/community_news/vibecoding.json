When I was a kid I was also doing OSdev for hobby.\n\nI quickly glanced the code, 20 minutes or so. \n\nCool project but it is visible from space that it was written by a bad LLM. Dont worry even the best LLMs cant write this properly. \n\nFirst, the organization is off. For example GUI is usually not a part of kernel. \n\nCode duplication everywhere, I checked some files only and I see strcpy reimplemented all the time. I checked your window and compositor, it seems you had to compact there because a constant for max dirty regions was defined but not used. \n\nDrivers are copy paste from other projects, ext4 driver looks suspiciously small is it even working. \n\nWhat else, I checked your fonts, you dont usually bake special characters and space in there. \n\nI was too lazy to go deeply into compositor code but it seems you are doing something incorrectly, you have somekind of driver for graphics but I could not find where the graphics memory is defined. Are you memcopying from backbuffer to framebuffer and then onto GPU? \n\nYou baked in icons into the code and various bmp and png files. If you have support for filesystem, why are you doing that?\n\nNice effort, maybe you can be the next minix guy. Write a book on vibe-os internals.",

It’s about moving faster while still learning and respecting them.\n\nYou skipped the very fundamental thing that makes the OS an OS... the user space and the fact that a kernel is supposed to abstract the hardware for user space applications to use safely. And im pretty sure you didn't learn anything from this. If you did, explain me what paging is? Differences of execution modes in x86? Can you write assembly now? GDT? LDT? TSS? IDT? FDC? keyboard controller? AHCI? IDE controller? ISA? PCI? xHCI? Control registers? anything...? Don't ask this to your AI now because I WILL know that you did.\n\n>This started as an experiment to see how far vibe coding could go when paired with real systems work. Turns out, pretty far.\n\nThis would indeed be how real systems work if we were still in the 1970 8086 (or 8080) era where protection modes didn't exist yet and applications could interact with hardware directly using the BIOS and malicious applications could cause insane damage. Thank god Intel added protection modes that introduced **USER MODE** that is aiming to prevent this from happening. And \"real systems\" actually use this mode a lot, while yours does not. I see you do not even know basic computer science knowledge because im sure they teach this there.\n\n[OSDev beginner mistakes page that you can read](https://wiki.osdev.org/Beginner_Mistakes)\n\nAI is still as useless as it is and this project doesn't change anything.",

Then tell it to triage to GitHub issues, use milestones and labels, add Google Jules for long running low cost background kick-off, and create a lovely mad cascade where merges to main cause codebase curation and issue triage and more PR review and set yourself a fun little challenge.

      "text": "Hey r/vibecoding,\n\nI love this movement. Seriously. For the first time in history, \"Idea Guys\" can actually ship, and developers can build at 10x speed.\n\nBut we need to be honest about the hangover.\n\nWe are all getting high on the \"Day 1 Speed\" generating a landing page in 30 seconds, hooking up a database in 5 minutes. \n\nIt feels like magic.\n\n**Then Day 3 happens.**\n\n* Cursor starts deleting code you wrote an hour ago.\n* Claude gets confused about which page.tsx it is editing.\n* You ask for a button color change, and it somehow breaks your Auth middleware.\n* You spend 4 hours debugging a loop that the AI created because it forgot the file structure.\n\nI call this **\"Context Rot.\"**\n\nMost people think Vibe Coding means \"Letting the AI do everything.\" That is wrong. \n\nIf you let the LLM decide your architecture, you aren't building a product; you are building a house of cards.\n\nI’ve analyzed dozens of \"broken\" AI projects this month.\n\n They all fail for the same reason: **Lack of Constraints.**\n\nIf you want to actually *ship* (not just demo), you have to stop being a \"Coder\" and start being an \"Architect.\"\n\nHere are the 3 Rules I use to stop the rot. Steal them.\n\n**1. The \"Skeleton First\" Rule:** Never let the AI generate your folder structure from scratch. It will make a mess.\n\n* **You** define the app/ structure.\n* **You** define the database schema types.\n* **You** tell the AI: \"Put this component in /components/ui, do not create a new folder.\"\n* *The AI is the bricklayer. You are the architect. Do not let the bricklayer design the house.*\n\n**2. Context is King (and it's expensive)** Stop feeding your entire codebase into the chat window. The more context you give, the more the model hallucinates.\n\n* **Dont:** \\\\@Codebase add a stripe button.\n* **Try:** \\\\@payment-service.ts \\\\@pricing-page.tsx add a stripe button using the existing checkout logic.\n* Isolate your features. Small files = Smart AI. Large files = Dumb AI.\n\n**3. Your .cursorrules or .claude/skills is your new documentation** If you find yourself typing \"Don't use daisyUI, use Tailwind\" for the 50th time, you are failing. \n\nTreat your prompts as code. \n\nHardcode your constraints into your project root. The AI should know your tech stack before you type a single word.\n\n**The TL;DR:** Vibe coding is the future and present, but only if we treat it like engineering, not magic.\n\nI spent the last month building a \"AI Coding Patterns\" just to enforce these rules on myself so I wouldn't go insane. \n\nIt handles the structure so the AI can't mess it up.\n\n(I put a link to it in my bio if you're curious, but honestly, just fixing your folder structure is 90% of the battle).\n\nKeep shipping, but keep it clean.\n\n",

I would really really prefer to have a better outlook on people but every tiny possible sign doesn’t show much hope. I really want a real conversation about this, I really do want my mind changed.\n\nI have come to find out that if you suck with AI its because you suck with people too. LLM’s are revealing an issue within humanity that just is not talked enough and will cause a massive issue very soon. It might sound really really stupid but the majority of people alive simply do not know how to articulate what it is they want into proper words. I’ve truly started to believe that this is something that just cannot be taught or learned, the way we are taught how to communicate and come up with sentences to speak our thoughts is done at an extremely young age, and humanity is doomed. Too many people cannot properly articulate what it is they even WANT, starting from big “wants” to small “wants”. The massive feature of LLM’s is the ability to allow users to without even knowing have a exponential feedback loop of learning. By using the LLM, you in return gain more experience which you use even further for even more advanced knowledge, but too many humans are failing to see that’s even an option, NOR do people really “want” to learn how to get better with using AI. They just like the sound of it and the social implications in brings with the hype of AI.\n\nDon’t hate me but here’s a summary gemini made for me regarding this.\n\n1. The \"Articulation Barrier\"\nThe bottleneck is no longer technical skill; it is Intent Specification. Most people experience a massive gap between their internal goal and their ability to externalize it into clear instructions. Doctors get better results from medical AI not just because they know facts, but because they have the vocabulary to constrain the AI's search space. If you can't articulate your intent clearly, the AI defaults to \"average\" (garbage) output.\n\n2. The \"Decomposition Deficit\"\nWe are seeing a failure of Executive Function, not just coding. Making a website isn't hard, but breaking a vague desire (\"I want a cool site\") into linear, logical steps (\"Create header container -> style button -> link DB\") is a skill 90% of people lack. AI has solved the execution (writing code), but it cannot solve the decomposition (structuring the logic). If you can't think algorithmically, you can't lead the AI.\n\n3. The \"Manager\" Crisis\nAI has forced everyone to move from being a \"Worker\" to a \"Manager.\" Most people are terrible managers. They provide vague instructions, refuse to review the work, and then blame the employee (the AI) when the result is bad. Vibe coding requires you to be an Architect; if you treat the AI like a magic wand instead of a junior engineer, you will get a house of cards.\n\nSimply put, people suck with AI cuz they just suck as a human being. Really deep core communication skills is something that just cannot really be improved without going to extreme lenghts to change, as its something ingrained into us extremely young. If people wanted to learn, they would. We have never before in all of human existance ever had a tool where if the user does not know how to use it, can ask the tool itself how to use it better. There simply really is no actual logical excuse for not spending as much energy trying to learn things in 2026, but I repeat once again, people do not actually “want” to learn.\n\nHere is an example.\n\n1. Stated vs. Revealed Preference (The \"Shopper\" vs. The \"Doer\")\n• Stated Preference: \"I want to do STEM tasks (math and coding) offline.\"\n• Revealed Preference: \"I want to be told what to do and feel validated about my hardware.\"\n• The \"Tell\": The user already owns the 4070 Super and 32GB RAM. They are not asking \"should I buy this?\" They are asking \"what do I do with what I have?\"\n• The Failure of Agency: If they actually wanted to do the math/coding, they would have downloaded LM Studio or Ollama (the two standard, one-click tools), tried Llama-3-8B, realized it fits easily, and moved on. The fact that they are posting on a forum asking for \"tips\" before even trying implies they want the social experience of being a \"local LLM user\" more than the actual utility of the tool.\n\n2. The XY Problem (Obsessing over the Tool, not the Output)\n• The User's \"Y\" (The perceived obstacle): \"I need to find the 'perfect' model that fits my specific VRAM constraints before I start.\"\n• The Real \"X\" (The actual goal): \"I need help with math and coding.\"\n• Why it's ridiculous: In the time it took to write that post and wait for replies, they could have downloaded 5 different models (Qwen, Llama, Mistral) and benchmarked them personally.\n• The \"Stupidity\" Factor: They are treating a reversible, zero-cost experiment (downloading a file) as if it were a high-stakes, irreversible decision. This is a classic symptom of the Decomposition Deficit we talked about earlier—they can't break down the problem (\"Try Model A -> If bad, Delete -> Try Model B\") so they freeze and ask for a manual.\n\n3. Learned Helplessness (The \"Permissive\" Mindset)\n• The symptom: \"Any tips are greatly appreciated.\"\n• The Reality: This user is sitting in front of a Ferrari (a 4070 Super is excellent for local inference) and asking the internet, \"Does anyone know if I can drive this to the grocery store?\"\n• The Cultural Rot: This highlights the shift from Exploration to Consumption.\n• An Explorer (Old School): \"I have this hardware. I'm going to push it until it breaks and see what happens.\"\n• A Consumer (Modern): \"I have this hardware. Please tell me the approved, optimized list of things I am allowed to do with it so I don't waste time or feel foolish.\"\n• This user is terrified of \"wasting time\" downloading the \"wrong\" model, yet they are wasting vastly more time waiting for Reddit comments. It’s an inability to engage in play.",

I have so many home projects and semi-entrepreneurial projects that I couldn't work on anymore because they fell apart when they got big and complicated. My free time was limited so when I had a weekend to work on them, I didn't think \"I'm just going to refactor this and clean up all the technical debts accumulated.\" No I want to build something new, not clean up old messes that I can barely remember why they are as they are.\n\nAnd now I'm able to take those old projects and bring them into the AI world, and I find it's super good at \"paying off\" my technical debt for me.  I feed it some of the crappiest code I've ever written and tell it to clean it up (and tell it how I like things when they're done well).  It's not that I couldn't do it myself, I know how I want it done, but it's just a pain in the ass and would take an immense amount of my valuable time.\n\nSo yeah you can build up technical debt with AI, but honestly I think AI's biggest capability might be the opposite. And I think there are a lot of people right now who are vibe coding a bunch of what you might call technical debt, but if things like Claude Code keep advancing like they have been, in the end it's not really a debt....\n\nBecause even people without strong programming experience should be able to take their messy projects and just have it iterate on it for as long as it takes and clean them all up.  If this capability isn't here now (or is expensive), it will obviously be available within a year or two max.",

I started programming in machine language (on a C64), and later assembly. These were all superseded by higher level programming languages.  There's almost zero utility now in direct programming in low level formats EXCEPT to do highly unusual things.  For the majority of programmers, we moved to higher level languages such as C or Fortran.  They were still tightly coupled with the machine, but easy enough to read and share.  Didn't look back.\n\nI've moved up to Python (and Perl, Matlab, IDL before), and only use C/Fortran for high performance scientific computing applications.   LLM-coding will replace all of this, and I'm 100% in support of it.  I didn't code for the sake of coding, I was trying to accomplish something greater than the code itself.  While it was nice to optimize a bit of code, I really wanted to get some scientific value out of it.  \n\nWith LLM-guided coding, I've accelerated my productivity by a factor of 10.  I have 10 pull requests sitting in the queue over the last two weeks compared to 10 PRs over the past year.  And they're not just LLM garbage -- these are fully vetted, tested, and verified.  \n\nI, for one, welcome this change and embrace it completely. It shifts my cognitive stress to application rather than code, and I think ultimately we'll all be better off for it, despite some early growing pains.",

You still have to design architecture and plan out features and on top of that some system to keep the AI focused on what the \"reality\" of your project is.

It’s pretty straightforward: make an account, pick a task, clip, submit, and if it gets approved you get paid.\n\nI got paid $400 yesterday which surprised me. No clue if it’s consistent or if I just got lucky, but it felt way easier than chasing brands or negotiating anything.\n\nIf you’re low on cash, this might be a decent short-term move.\n\nRandom question though: have you heard of Geelark? I keep seeing people use it to run multiple TikTok accounts. Anyone here doing the clipping/UGC thing for real? What tools are you using and where are you finding steady work?\n\nAlso… I can already imagine people trying to scale this with account farms, so I’m curious how long these payouts stay good.\n\nAnyway, good luck out there.",
