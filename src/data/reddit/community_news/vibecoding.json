I still cannot sit down and write a line of code without help. However, I can read code and find bad code and have a LLM fix it as well as use the auto code feature for finishing code I know I need. The new thing or skill now is learning how to detect old worthless code that creates what people are calling AI slop or spaghetti, and I am getting very good at that as well. It does take a lot of time to complete phases of my codes, so there are times where I know if I could write code I could do it WAY faster, but I cant retain all enough to type code, so I just learn what causes spaghetti code and hope I find it before it ruins anything beyond repair.",

They won't stop cleanup 'when the code runs'. They will seek to understand what it produces and look not just for well-formatted code, but pitfalls they've seen before.\n\nA senior engineer will also understand how to allocate their time. They will understand that all code is generally security relevant, but where historic attacks are. They will implement defenses - possibly by asking the AI to write a first draft of input validation, for example.\n\nThey will understand that RegEx is really powerful, but when you use RegEx to solve a problem, you now have two problems: the original issue and the fact that RegEx can be fragile. They will know, in the back of their head, parts of a task they haven't told the AI yet due to context limits and reshape the code in advance - for example, choosing a more efficient data structure for the entire goal then the part you just generated.\n\nAs for Linus? I generally trust his judgement. He's not perfect, but he has had one of the most complex jobs in software development for decades. The fact that he's picking a hobby project to experiment with AI and learn it a bit? Best case scenario. Hell, I personally have trouble learning a tool, library or language if I don't have a task well suited for it.\n\nIn this case, he's writing code of a type he doesn't write nearly as often. And, AI with the right guidance can write good code, and with a senior engineer it can be great code.",

Still use it for the front-end, because it writes like 30 lines a second, but you need to spend some time perfecting the UI, and often the backend. Obviously shouldn’t trust it for auth stuff, or if you do, really look on to what it did, cause that’s serious stuff. I don’t think AI will steal jobs to us, it will just make our job faster. I managed to commit 40k lines of code in like 4 or 5 hrs, that’s magic (to be noted: that commit was made in a review branch, so it doesn’t include all the reviewing time). Also, AI doesn’t have a taste, you still need to tell it what you want, what functionality, the theme etc. About the themes: they don’t come from AI, AI just knows what the CSS for “material design” should look like, so new styles are hard to create with AI. Also, languages, frameworks and standards can’t be created by AI alone. Our job is not being stolen, it’s just being reshaped in a more “creative” one, rather than a 10% imagine, 90% coding, it’s now more like a 60% imagine, 40% writing blasphemy to the model because it halucinated…",

Part of the problem with all these people vibe-coding their ideas is that they don't know what they don't know ***and the AI isn't going to tell them because it doesn't either***. \n\nIf I had a dollar for the number of times I've had to explain to a non-technical executive that they're asking for something that is just not technically possible, l'd be able to afford a very nice dinner out for me and my family. I get asked a lot less about these problems now, but I hear about how they're going to happen any day now, just as soon as they can work out how to make the AI understand the idea (as the code keeps not working for some reason).",

But that says more about what problems the English-speaking tech-adjacent world thinks are worth solving than about vibe coding itself.\nHere's what you're missing from your app store vantage point:\n\nWhile you're mocking CRUD apps, someone in Bangalore can finally prototype a transparency system that surfaces bribery patterns in municipal contracts. A teacher in rural Nigeria who never learned syntax can now show exactly how an education delivery system should work. A motivated citizen can build a working demo of how road accident data should flow to actually save lives instead of disappearing into bureaucratic black holes.\n\nThe software industry had 40 years to solve these problems. They didn't. Why? Because children dying of diarrhea in India isn't a profitable market segment.\nVibe coding isn't about replacing senior engineers at Google. It's about giving the prototype pen to the people who actually see the problems—and have been locked out by syntax gatekeeping and software budgets.\nYour critique assumes the only valid apps are the ones that make it to the App Store for Western consumers. That's not a defense of quality. That's a confession of tunnel vision.\n\nThe condescension from devs was never quality control. It was a bottleneck on human imagination. Good riddance.",

Of course, technology (specifically coding languages) is evolved. \nConsidering that, I am not even good at prompting because I don't know how it should actually be done. Giving business requirements is definitely not working. For me, LLM works best when prompts are precise. \nFor example, I caught it with dependency injection (despite clear instructions) and hashing (again clear instructions), it just simply apologized and asked me if I wanted to do that. \n\nNow, I can't understand the complete code structure and I find it risky to put something like this on prod and charge money for services it offers",

I'm fairly certain their 1m context window for pro tier is complete BS. I had no other choice so I adapted: every time I wanted to add a feature I asked gemini to tell me how to do it myself, to give me only the lines of code required to make the changes and nothing else, I start a new chat every time a function is done implementing or a fix is complete, never stretch the conversation unless strictly needed. First tell gemini about the Change you want to make, ask them their thoughts about it, if there's a better approach to my idea, and when everything's seem to click, then ask them to write code. Routinely ask for code audits. Don't upload your code to the chat if not strictly necessary, but do it inside the gems context to save on tokens. \n\nI'm currently building a highly custom ERP for my family's business and it's going surprisingly well. I almost finished all the core functions and logic which was honestly incredibly time consuming and tedious, now I'm focusing on making the app look and feel good, making it responsive for use in phones. I'm amazed at how well it's getting. It's also incredible how much I'm learning about coding and ui/ux design. I'm almost reaching 3 months semi manually vibe coding non stop from dawn til dusk and I love every second of it. I spend 20$ a month + my time, but I'd say its completely worth it.

I went from being careful to vibecode 2 out of 3 projects and run codebase tightening and cleanup with scheduled batch prompts (cuz pretty cheap and you don't need this to run real time anyway). Really brute forcing the thing with multi model code tightening which solves at least 50% of code bloat.\nAnd I'd say it depends on your business. If you work for clients then you can take 3x more projects and those $800 will be absorbed in like the 3rd day of the month. Then you just earn by reselling your agents basically for a much higher price that you pay them the rest of the month.\nFrom my POV the big tech is just giving us free money (as long as you can find enough clients ofc).",

I'm not jealous of this generation of people coding at all.\n\nIve developed a whole file sharing via crypto platform, with admin panels, good UX, multi level caching, storage, privacy, fallbacks for crypto-platforms when some other fail. All with 20$/month for 3-4 months, on github copilot and maybe 1-2 times when i tested anthropic BYOK which costed a hell of a lot money (80$ for what I could do with copilot for 2-5$).\n\nYou need to be able to know: libraries, programming practices and design patterns, guide the LLM to use specific design practices to avoid future maintenance issues, either by you or the LLM. How to read errors and how to guide the LLM to fix an error, there's a big difference between \"build doesn't compile because you changed this class' static variable to return X because of Y, fix\" and \"please fix we have an error\". One will spend 1 million tokens trying to debug it and loop over circular reasoning, other will spend 5-50k tokens making direct changes.\n\nPlus, LLMs are famous for being blamed for security issues (e.g. API tokens exposed). But if you know how to guide it, you can prevent yourself from doing stupid things that would turn into large security issues. I didn't know what Envelop encryption was, for file data, until the LLM recommended it to me, because I asked it to recommend me ways on how to do one feature. They can save you a lot of time and money from doing mistakes.\n\nIn summary, yall trying to vibe-code, without being engineers.",

Meet with local businesses that need better sites and progressive web apps. Stick to ones that are hyper simple, no storefronts online, database management, etc... Offer to make them a WordPress theme for their existing site to spruce it up, make a PWA menu for the restaurant for customers to browse stuff, that kind of thing. \n\nYou can get $5-10k per job for this kind of work. Claude Code can rip it out FAST, and if you target businesses that have requirements that vibe coding is good at, you're good to go.  I would avoid clients that seem overly picky about the exact placement of things and jobs where you have to implement complex stuff on the backend. Those are doable, but you would be able to rip out ten wordpress themes in the time it would take to implement a web store for example.",

You don’t want to unexpectedly hit cost limits, request-per-second caps, or provider quotas. It also helps protect against bad actors using your app as a proxy. Adding alerts when usage approaches a limit would be a nice touch and relatively easy to implement.\n\nContent safety (possibly overkill, but relevant):\n\nSince the app seems mainly focused on kids, you might consider sending the generated result to another LLM (image-to-text) for moderation checks (sexual content, inappropriate text, etc.). Even if you already restrict this in your prompt, a creative user can bypass it. You can’t prevent everything, but you can make a best effort.\n\nAdditional input methods & accessibility:\n\nI added speech support to the UI using the Web Speech API. This allows not only image-based input but also speech-to-image flows. In this case, you’d also need to secure against prompt injection.\n\nPossible flows could be:\n\nspeech → doodle → AI image\n\nspeech → AI image\n\nspeech → style → applied to a doodle\n\nNot all kids are great painters, and having worked with children with disabilities, I think offering multiple input options is important.\n\nGood luck!!",

I'll be honest I still don't understand GitHub but it seems to be the spot, keep in mind where I'm coming from is the limewire and bear share days so that shows how out of the loop I am. So I won't even ask a question I'll just present my situation. I sell handcrafted products (I know what you're thinking but I'm not like all of those) and it's taking off pretty well the last year but I need to get a social or online presence and I would like AI to help me with that I had one telling me step by step but I lost it and I can't find it. But I have so many ideas for my business that I would be perfect for and a lot of designing aspects but those apps don't exist and it seems like you guys just make them now. I'm not asking for anyone to hold my hand just asking for a direction. If y'all could point me to a website or just point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it. Most forums were chat rooms is just a lot of bickering and heaven forbid you asked for genuine advice or help. Anyway this is too long already if someone could help I would really be grateful",

It also has a book which explains the basic stuff. I am the same as you experienced dev but no hardware exp so the book was quite helpful\n\nEdit: Be wary though, it is so fun that I got a box full of electronics at home now that is full of components used in past prototyping/having fun projects :p like led strips, microphones, various sensors, cables, solder, breadboards, a few arduinos, a few pi picos, etc. lol",

But, for now, there are plenty of niche markets with small or medium sized businesses that function mostly unaware of the tools and the efficiency available to them. So if you see a tool that is already created, sometimes that is a reason why you should create the tool that you were creating. Not only to make it one that you can legally sell, but to make more efficient progress and have an opportunity to tweak and improve on their concept. Market research. \n\n\nThis won't last forever. It will eventually be flooded with micro apps for every niche you can think of, but for now there is plenty of opportunity to write an app for plumbers who specialize in plumbing houses with basements in cold climates.\n\nFor me, your advice is sound. Because this is new and difficult for me. And I can spend an entire day working on something and achieving nothing. I'm still learning so I am not too hard on myself, but yesterday I spent the whole day working on trying to refactor what was already done, and today I am going back a step and I feel like I just burned a lot of energy and fried a lot of brain cells and didn't accomplish much. Ultimately, I am learning so maybe I am not wasting time, but it sure feels like it right now.",

I have extensive programming experience so I'm good at reading code and understanding how it works and how different pieces come together. I have that shit down pat.\n\nI have been giving ChatGPT and Claude firm instructions on what requirements I have and asking it to work within those requirements. The code almost never works on the first try if it's a complex request but refining the prompts fixes it, but the real danger is when the code seems to work but has logic flaws or security vulnerabilities. \n\nReviewing the code, it often becomes clear the LLMs don't have a full understanding of how the different pieces work together. For example, I recently had an issue that BOTH Claude and GPT couldn't fix until I found what the issue was and told them how to fix it.\n\nThere was a call from a render loop which would get the loading percentage from the background process which was doing the loading. There was another variable for load completion being set to true by the background thread, on the background thread, which would stop the background thread from continuing to run after it hit 100%. The problem was that this was happening before the render loop could read that it was at 100% so the loading never got flagged as complete on the render thread. In situations like this one both Claude and GPT completely failed to debug the problem because they couldn't understand the context. I had to specifically tell them what the problem was and how to fix it.\n\nI really think the issue with AI code is how people will use it without knowing how to read code so they won't know if the output is any good or not.\n\nAt the end of the day, to an experienced programmer, AI ends up just being an overhyped form of auto complete. It speeds things up but relying on it for debugging or generating complex projects for now is still a fools errand.\n\nThose are just my thoughts I'm open to changing my view but I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\n\n ",

Include tests for every step. \n\nYou will end up with a bunch of quick and concise tasks that you can copy and paste into the prompt for cheaper agents to execute.  I like GLM-4.7 for that lately.

Sometimes it does go a little off the rails, but then it's just a case of starting a new agent. I'm a beginner strictly speaking myself. I was trying to learn python but ideas kept coming to me and I had no idea to implement them so I turned to vibe coding and I'm working on my own Augment clone. You could use Augments mcp in your various platforms too. Not here to advertise it. Augment is going down because they have messed up their pricing and made it similar to Cursor's, I feel sometimes that it is just taking the scenic route to use more credits. It is quite expensive because I use legacy pro which is 208000 credits but I've used 121000 in two days granted I did do some major work using Opus. I do love Opus and the context engine in Augment without the bs hopefully what my context engine Vs code ext AI coder is going to be one day 😂",

Eventually had a wake-up call that I was never going to be able to fix my fucked up GPA at this point so I might as well just pivot to business and focus (and did well from that point on).\n\nWith my only formal education being 2 years of comp sci (that I barely understood even back then), I had to play the game \"The Farmer Was Replaced\" to even learn the basics again. However, these vibe coding tools still enabled me to get what I want out of them.\n\nFor example, I don't know coding best practices, but I can ask the tool to review for those best practices and apply them. I don't know security best practices, but I can ask it to review for security. I don't know what I don't know so I can't even ask them to address it...so I ask it to red-team the proposed design and tell me what I don't know that I should be considering. I don't know how to avoid pitfalls in back-end architecture and race condition consideration etc. (never even heard of \"race conditions\"), but I asked it to think about it and it got back to me with proposals and then did it well enough. I don't know how to properly comment/document code but I asked it to do it anyway just in case.\n\nThere are situations where the AI can't figure out how to fix the bug, but I can ask it to provide me with a differential diagnosis strategy and work with me on it. I can ask other models or ask them to search online. These strategies all ended up working.\n\nAt the end of the day, the tools are doing what I expect them to. When I poke and prod them in testing, or use them for the intended purpose, it's able to address those things. So if for all intents and purposes it appears to work, that means it's fulfilling it's purpose.\n\nI'm not a coder by profession or even as a hobby, I work in FP&A (though I do have a PMP, the closest thing I get to code is SQL when dealing with ERP migration or planning software implementation from the product owner side), One thing that is common in FP&A is that you refine the business cases to be \"accurate enough\", then just go with it, because it's directionally accurate and precise enough to not change the conclusions that the decision relies upon, then just continuing to delay and refine the case to be perfect is delaying a decision that can have real impact and keeps us from moving on and dealing with the other decisions we haven't even started to analyze. In practical terms, I feel like these vibecoding tools align really well with the \"move fast and move on\" mentality that's required in my industry.\n\nI'll be getting more experienced at vibecoding, even if it isn't hands-on experience with code. If it means I keep getting useful results faster and more frequently, it won't make me an \"experienced programmer\", but it does mean the vibe coding doesn't \"suck\" because from a pragmatic perspective, if it works it works.",

Vibecode your way to a graphics layer that really speaks to the game / experience you're trying to make. \n\nAt least for the next few years before real time video generation makes raster pipelines a thing of the past :D \n\nWas torn between doing something like this and a path tracing voxel engine or something like that, but this was a bit of a better test project since apart from the choice of rendering buffer it's all pretty vanilla / standard game-dev stuff and utilizing well understood techniques and file formats.",

Like a Q&A type mode where you say something like \"I played X game and things looked like Y, what are techniques that accomplish this\" - explore different ideas, and then implement them and learn about them as you go. \n\nFor example, MSAA is about the dumbest version of antialiasing - in a way starting from a project like this one and modding it is also a good way.  Like hey this goofball made a terminal based game, can we convert it into something that runs on the GPU and looks like whatever.  Then taking it from there and saying, \"how do I add shadows to this\" \n\nSo yeah, I do agree - having a bit of knowledge helps a lot, but to a degree that makes me feel better since I think ultimately these coding agents really reward curiosity at the end of the day.",

I have not looked at the code once, including logs.  I did prompt it to make mini apps against the game to test out certain aspects / sub-systems - for example graphics or map loading, to work through particularly annoying issues. \n\nWill agree that I might have been talking to the agent in more sophisticated language than someone that's never built graphics / game-tech before.

The fact that it's an OS, to me, means nothing more than that your project is different from the typical vibe coded project on here but doesn't really demonstrate any new or more impressive AI capabilities. It's still just reimplementing things that already exist but in, probably, a worse way. \n\nI think a really cool follow up post for you would be to have AI analyze existing popular operating systems and try to identify limitations or pain points. Then try to have it address those in your OS implementation. Basically work together with it to try and come up with a truly novel OS, architecture, or paradigm in how OSs work or should be used. But you could certainly use this as the starting point to that kind of work.",

It's in finding actual problems in spaces you know well, where people are currently using spreadsheets or juggling 5 different tools, and building something purpose built for that specific use case. The best saas ideas come from domain expertise that regular people don't havethe problems only someone working in that industry would even know exist.\n\nRight now we're at the stage where people are browsing lists of other successful saas products and think they can just recreate it and see the same success. They can't. Because they're missing the context of why it worked, who the actual users were, and how it was marketed. Building will most likely be the easier part in the future. Distribution and actually understanding your users is where most people fail. So even though tons of these random apps keep popping up, most will be at a dead end.",

Are there any products available on the market that solves this? No? It doesn't exist, but all of our systems have an API layer and can interconnect to solve that problem? Can you recommend a solution for our scale and resources? Great.\n\nI have a small team of less than 5 devs and ops people. I have a total addressable market of the 30 people on my team. A 1 to 6 ratio is pretty good. Whereas some SaaS business out there is trying to solve for tens of thousands of customers. They will never build anything better than the in-house team at this point.\n\nSaaS products are approximate averages of the business problems that exist in the market. I can be surgical. I have context. I know exactly where our friction points are and the nuances of our problem set. I know John, I know Katie, I know Mariam. I know what they are good at. I know what makes them tick. I know what they respond to. I know the rate of turnover. I know the technical capability of our team. I know I can build a simple CLI tool for some people. I know I have to build UI's for others. And the AI generates perfect docs for all these in-house products. A SaaS will could never move like that.
