Simply nailing down the product requirements, writing (or reviewing) a technical design doc, requiring the agent to add and run tests with each commit, and reviewing PRs will make the agents' output a lot more sensible. Use them as very diligent, somewhat competent, but very forgetful junior engineers and you will not be disappointed.\n\nAlternatively, after you have requirements, you can write a ton of tests against the API layer, use those tests to programmatically identify dead backend code and remove it, then break out one chunk of endpoints at a time and re-write them in new modules.  Then you can write a new frontend, starting with a proper API client and then going screen-by-screen - you may be able to parallelize this somewhat with another developer, but expect to uncover inconsistencies in the API as you go.\n\nBut that's how I've gone about refactoring a project that was shipped to users, where you have to take care not to break anything at every step.  If nothing has shipped yet, you have the freedom of starting over and can get there faster.",

Also write tests first. It might help just splitting the big file up into independent endpoints first, without changing any logic.

Even if you give it some capabilities via MCP this minimal task I have where it fails still occurs as its not a good for for AI.\n\nA hybrid approach is probably better.

Before touching anything, add basic integration tests for the main flows. Use the app as a black box and test the API endpoints. This is your safety net.\n\n  \n2. Start extracting one route group at a time into separate files. Pick the simplest one first. Keep the original file as the router that imports from the new modules.\n\n  \n3. Use Claude Code or similar to help with the mechanical refactoring. Paste chunks of the 30K file and ask it to identify logical groupings and extract them. The AI can handle tedious extraction work pretty well.\n\n  \nFor the frontend UI/UX mess:\n\n  \n1. Create a simple style guide first, even just 5-6 rules: primary color, font stack, button styles, spacing scale. Apply these globally via CSS variables.\n\n  \n2. Pick one component pattern (cards, forms, whatever is most common) and make it consistent everywhere. Then move to the next pattern.\n\n  \n3. Do NOT try to redesign everything at once. Consistency beats perfection when cleaning up.\n\n  \nThe key is incremental improvement with tests protecting you. Your boss created technical debt but its not unfixable. Just chip away at it.",

Both are solid, but once you count lots of external users the numbers were not that different in the long run. In the end I stopped thinking in terms of “portal builder” and moved to a normal database plus an app builder on top.\n\nFor me that ended up being UIBakery on top of Postgres. I am not from their team or anything, it just fit better. External users only see their own rows, auth is handled once, and the pricing felt saner than paying per head for every customer who logs in twice a month. It took a bit more setup than Softr on day one, but I am much less stressed about the bill now.\n\nBig question is really your monthly budget and how technical you are willing to get. If you want to stay very low effort, Glide or Stacker might be easier. If you are ok touching a DB or getting some help, something like UI Bakery on top of Airtable or a proper DB can be a nice middle ground.",

Without that breathing room this turns into constant firefighting instead of real cleanup.\n\nThen I’d approach it in a structured, iterative way, in small steps:\n\n1. Stabilize the current state Make sure builds and runtime are reproducible and that it’s clear what currently works. Put very lightweight safeguards around the most important flows so you notice quickly if something breaks during refactoring.\n2. Make the structure visible Group the existing code into logically related functional areas and get a rough understanding of how they interact. At this stage it’s about creating clarity, not changing behavior.\n3. Modularize before optimizing Gradually move toward smaller, more clearly bounded modules without altering functionality. The goal here is readability and maneuverability, not “clean code” yet.\n4. Incremental simplification Once the structure holds, start reducing duplication, clarifying responsibilities, and making boundaries more explicit. It’s normal to go through multiple passes before things feel right.\n5. Bring UI/UX into a consistent shape No big redesign. Define a small set of layout and styling rules and apply them consistently over time. Consistency matters more than perfection here.\n\nAI can help a lot with the mechanical parts (splitting code, restructuring, repetitive changes), but it can’t make the judgment calls around boundaries, priorities, and acceptance criteria for you.\n\nThis only works if time is intentionally allocated for it. You’re being paid to do this and you’ll learn a lot about refactoring and system understanding, but without clear expectations and space, it quickly becomes your personal problem instead of a structural one.",

Then get cracking. It should take a couple of hours tops.\n\nThis is how I have worked with similar apps developed and abandoned by human developers. Code was bloated and full of dependencies and broken functionality due to years of neglect and oversight. (Node 8, we pack, react/angular mix).\n\nKeep the vanilla JS and CSS.

The system was built without anyone ever deciding what was in charge, what was allowed to change, and what absolutely shouldn’t. Once features start shipping faster than understanding, entropy wins every time.\n\nOn the UI/UX specifically, the trap is trying to “fix” it globally. If you touch everything at once, you’ll never finish. The only sane move is to pick one thin vertical slice that actually matters to users, define what “correct” looks like there, and enforce consistency only inside that boundary. Treat everything else as radioactive until proven otherwise.\n\nMore broadly, don’t try to refactor this into a good system straight away. First goal is to make it legible. Break the giant API file only if you can explain why each new boundary exists. If you can’t explain it, Cursor won’t be able to maintain it either.\n\nYou’re basically inheriting a product that worked by momentum, not structure. The fastest way out isn’t cleaning up the slop, it’s stopping the bleeding and forcing a single source of truth back into the system.\n\nIt’s rough work, but you’re asking the right question.",

We're seeing a similar 'interaction hunger' with **ReplyFan**, but on the human side—people using AI just to keep up with the noise on old-school social networks.\n\nIt’s fascinating to see Moltbook creating a sandbox where agents can just vibe with each other. Do you think the future is us (the humans) just observing these agent networks, or will tools like ReplyFan bridge the gap by letting our personal agents 'vibe' in the real world for us? Fascinating milestone! ",

      "text": "I'm a professional software engineer with decades of experience who has really been enjoying vibe coding lately.  I'm not looking to discourage anyone or gatekeep here, I am truly thrilled by AI's ability to empower more software development. \n\nThat said, if you're a pure vibe coder (you don't read/understand the code you're generating) your codebase is over 100k lines, and you're either charging money or creating something people will depend on then PLEASE either do way more testing than you think you need to and/or try to find someone to do a code review (and yes, by all means, please ask the AI to minimize/optimize the codebase, to generate test plans, to automate as much testing as possible, and to review your code.  I STILL recommend doing more testing than the AI says and/or finding a person to look at the code).\n\nI'm nearly certain, more than 90% of the software people are vibe coding does not need > 100k lines of code and am more confident in saying that your users will never come close to using that much of the product.     \n  \nSome stats:\n\nA very quick research prompt estimates between 15-50 defects per 1000 lines of human written code.  Right now the AI estimate is 1.7x higher.  So 25.5 - 85 bugs per 1000 lines.  Averaging that out (and chopping the decimal off) we get 55 bugs per 1000 lines of code.  So your 100k code base, on average, has 5500 bugs in it.  Are you finding nearly that many?\n\nThe number of ways your features can interact increases exponentially.  It's defined by the formula 2\\^n - 1 - n.  So if your app has 5 features there are 26 possible interactions. 6 features 57, 7 features 120, 8 features 247 and so on.  Obviously the amount of significant interactions is much lower (and the probability of interactions breaking something is not nearly that high) but if you're not explicitly defining how the features can interact (and even if you are defining it with instructions we've all had the AI ignore us before) the AI is guessing.  Today's models are very good at guessing and getting better but AI is still probabalistic and the more possibilities you have the greater the chances of a significant miss.\n\nTo try to get in front of something, yes, software written by the world's best programmers has plenty of bugs and I would (and do) call for more testing and more careful reviews across the board.  However, the fact that expert drivers still get into car accidents doesn't mean newer drivers shouldn't use extra caution.\n\nBottom line, I'm really excited to see the barrier to entry disappearing and love what people are now able to make but I also care about the quality of software out there and am advocating that the care you put in to your work matches the scope of what you're building.",

So many super granular tests for things like \"is this function returning what's expected on a specific input\" and some test that will run over a whole feature like \"does this button does what it's supposed to be doing\".\n\nTo have truly solid software, you should spend almost as much time writing tests than building features and methodologies like test driven development go as far as writing the tests before the first line of feature code.\n\nFor vibe coding specifically, I'd suggest introducing this in your prompts. Maybe get Claude to give you test case before you start on the feature, that way you would have good indicator that it's working for the ai. Also, as your automated test base grow, you will catch way more regression since tests will stop passing on unrelated part of the software when you bump into a weird interaction.",

Gut feel is this could surpass many human dev teams. What you say about the exponential and level of interactions is interesting and I buy it. Ok so an LLM is probabilistic. What is a human? Is there a deterministic world where a human is guaranteed to find all these bugs? Humans very often lack, sleep, motivation, focus, time, energy and so forth. So clearly a human is not deterministic in the respect you can depend on them to nail the search for bugs in a reliable way. So therefore to say an LLM is probabilistic is not to say much, if we conclude the human developer is also probabilistic (as to the probability they will identify most bugs)",

              "text": "There's been plenty of cases with experienced professional devs fully embracing AI where bugs are slipping in, even with all the automated AI review they've setup and vulnerability scanning.\n\nOne recent example is a dev that's pushed 40k commits in less than a year on github with multiple AI agents collaborating on various projects. One of these was a community hub for a tool that users could share extensions on.\n\nThe vulnerability found was that you could upload an SVG as an icon for your extension that would show when browsing a list or on its own page. The SVG wasn't post processed to strip executable code however so it could run JS when loaded in your browser.\n\nDespite the dev having many years of experience at big corporations and a reputation full of praise, this vulnerability allowed a common XSS vulnerability. The assets like this SVG weren't served from a separate origin, there was no protection in place to prevent the SVG from stealing authentication cookies, and localStorage API was used to store JWT including a refresh token.\n\nSo a malicious SVG would infect all logged in users on that site, which would update any of their own authored extensions to infect, and so forth. Not only that these extensions would be used to run AI automation on systems. So all users of the extension would get an update and grant the attacker full access to the environment the AI agent ran in, which meant even more secrets and exploits to access.\n\nThat same dev also has another project for devs that has a desktop widget to show github stats and other features. To do this it should only need a token granting read-only access, but instead it's full write permissions. If compromised all users github accounts are at risk.\n\nEven if you are careful with your own AI usage, you may begin to use new libraries that are fully developed by AI where similar mistakes are made. These dependencies could be far down in the supply chain and thus really difficult for you to audit or even be aware of until it's too late.\n\nThe risk of these problems is far greater due to AI usage spreading and the highly likely scenario of the users to not be as cautious or knowledgeable as someone working at a slower pace with full understanding of these topics (who can still make mistakes, sure). That concern really compounds how cautious we must be.",

There are cases where they could all, interact with each other but the credits feature probably doesn't need to interact with the game options or quit game but if they do (ex: there's an option to turn off showing credits at the end or the end credits after game completion will bring up the quit game feature when they're done displaying) it's unlikely to cause big problems if either the option or the end of credits quit interaction doesn't work.",

Interfacing with software such as Unity where there is a switch it would rather write its own routine to address a situation, and when it goes wrong add even more bad code. \nI guess a third thing is one that just happened to me. Its code expected a situation to occur in order for camera movement to occur. This is both of the two issues above. It was insane. I told it to simply do nothing in the situation. It came back with different code. I told it to stop and simply do nothing. It came back suggesting even more code.

          "text": "Totally with you on the “LOC as golf score” thing, with the big caveat that readability wins and “less” only matters if you’re not smearing complexity across 40 folders. Where Warp has helped me in practice is making “being careful” feel like part of the workflow instead of a lecture you ignore at 2am. I’ll start a change with \\`/plan\\` so the agent has to commit to a concrete approach before it touches the repo, and the plan stays versioned so you can actually compare what you asked for vs what it did later.  Then when it spits out a diff, Interactive Code Review is genuinely useful because you can leave inline comments like a normal PR review and have the agent address them in one pass, which is a nice guardrail against “it works on my machine” vibes.  The other underrated safety net is Full Terminal Use, since a lot of real breakage only shows up when you run interactive flows, REPLs, debuggers, “top”, DB shells, etc, and Warp’s agent can actually drive those while you watch and take over when it’s about to do something dumb. If you’re dealing with a big vibed codebase, the “don’t lose the spec” problem is half the battle, so having a shared place to store plans, test checklists, runbooks, and workflows that sync for the team is clutch; Warp Drive is basically that lightweight shared brain, and you can keep it organized and up to date without it turning into yet another dead Confluence.  And if you want to push the review/testing discipline further, the Slack or Linear integrations are surprisingly good for “hey, go reproduce this bug and open a PR” without context-dropping, because the agent runs in a defined remote environment and reports back in the same thread with what it did.  That “environment” piece matters when you’re trying to avoid phantom green tests, since it’s an explicit Docker image + repo set + setup commands, not “whatever happened to be on my laptop today”.",

Keep a [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) file in the root with your project context, conventions, and architecture decisions. Every time you come back to add features, Claude picks up where you left off instead of reinventing patterns.\n\n  \n2. Break changes into small PRs. Vibe coding makes it tempting to do huge refactors but that is where things fall apart. Small incremental changes are way easier to debug when something breaks.\n\n  \n3. Use git branches for experiments. Let Claude try wild ideas on a branch, test it, then merge or toss it.\n\n  \n4. For debugging, feeding Claude the error plus relevant context works better than just pasting the stack trace. Give it the function, the test that failed, and what you expected.\n\n  \nThe real insight: maintainability with AI coding is less about the code quality and more about YOUR understanding of the architecture. If you know how the pieces fit, you can always fix things. If you let the AI go wild without understanding what it built, you're toast.\n\n  \nSpeed vs maintainability? I optimize for understanding. Slower upfront but way faster at month 6.",

The architecture is important, Starting on [Lovable.dev](http://Lovable.dev) meant inheriting a React + TypeScript frontend built with Vite, which is primarily client-side rendered. That setup is not ideal for SEO, so I had to introduce server-side rendering selectively to compensate. If I just started with a Next.js app, that already has SSR which is better for SEO. I don't have any issues maintaining it, I've had to rebuild some sections like all the RSS parsing and categorization, agent editorial management but with new models and services, you're going to be rebuilding things regularly. I know one startup that rearchitects and rebuilds almost every 6 months.",

Everyone talks about how easy it is now with Claude Code, Antigravity etc.., but they leave out the part where you get completely fucked by production issues that AI can't solve.\n\nPure AI coding gets you maybe 60% there. You can build nice landing pages, set up login systems, even get a decent dashboard running. But then real subscribers start using your product and everything breaks in ways the AI never warned you about.\n\nLemonsqueezy integration that worked perfectly in test mode but randomly failed with real customers. I thought I was making money while actual payments were bouncing. AI couldn't explain webhook validation or why certain cards were getting declined without proper error handling.\n\nDatabase performance that was fine with 10 users but completely shit with 1,000+. Every query started timing out. AI kept suggesting caching fixes instead of telling me I was running garbage queries on unindexed tables. My dashboard was loading every single data point instead of paginating like a normal human would.\n\nUser sessions that just randomly logged people out. What happens when someone's subscription expires while they're using the app? How do you handle multiple browser tabs? AI could fix individual bugs but had no clue how to build proper session management.\n\nData isolation problems where customers could see each other's data. That's a fun support ticket to get. AI had zero understanding of how to debug multi-tenant architecture or why my database setup was fundamentally broken.\n\nBilling logic that looked perfect but created accounting chaos. Proration, failed payment retries, subscription changes - the AI code \"worked\" but had edge cases that destroyed my revenue tracking. One customer downgrading somehow triggered three billing events and I couldn't figure out what the hell happened.\n\nThe turning point was realizing I needed to be a better AI supervisor, not just blindly trust whatever code it spat out. Started setting up actual logging for critical actions, testing payment flows with real cards before launching, keeping a simple spreadsheet of what actually worked vs what looked good in dev.\n\nSpent a few weeks learning database basics, payment processing fundamentals, how web apps actually handle user data and security. Not trying to become a senior dev, just enough to read server logs and understand when something was genuinely broken vs a quick fix.\n\nMost success stories skip the part where they got stuck for weeks on subscription billing or had to hire actual developers to rebuild their payment system. The sweet spot is learning just enough SaaS fundamentals to not get completely destroyed by production, then using AI to move 10x faster on the stuff you actually understand.\n\nStill using AI for 90% of my development, but now I can tell when it's giving me code that'll explode in production vs code that'll actually work with real users and real money.",

This is a subtle auth thing that flies under the radar. Lock on user row when refreshing token - don't blindly refresh. To servers this looks like lost creds and multiple big OAuth providers require re-auth.\n\n\nE: if it's not clear, imagine the auth server getting a refresh tokens request, refreshing the token, and then getting another request for the old, now revoked token.

      "text": "I don’t know how to write code and I have never built anything before. I’m just a middle aged dude that started building now, AI makes superhumas out of people (people that really know hot to leverage it). People call it vibecoding but I think that word is fucking stupid. \n\nAnyways, for brief context: I’m building a mini-webapp (it’s called Picturific) that automatically generates multiple images with zero prompts, while keeping character and style continuity. \n\nThis is how it went down.\n\nI went to Austin for a music show (the band’s name is Orchid, if anyone cares) for 3 days. I did not take my laptop and I did not check emails. I only checked emails when arrived, and I started seeing receipts from FAL. At first I saw 2, which I thought and knew was a lot. But I did not think much of it. I continued working. Then I came back to check the emails again. I scrolled more. And a shitload of these FAL emails started appearing.\n\nIn less than 72 hours, my project had burned through $700+. Fuck.\n\nI had no idea how this happened.\n\nI spent the next 6 hours pissed, digging through logs, with the help of the same AI that had messed up the code. But I had no choice, I don’t know how to code. I had to work with the AI knowing it was capable of fucking up again. \n\nIt turns out I (or rather the AI) had built what the AI called a \"Ghost Machine.\" If you're building with AI agents and cloud functions, you might want to read this.\n\nOne of the core values of my app Picturific is consistency. To keep our characters looking the same across x scenes, I built an \"AI Auditor\" (The AI called it the Eye of Sauron). After every image is generated, the auditor checks it against a character reference sheet. If the hair is slightly wrong or a character is missing a medal (for example), it rejects the image and triggers a retry.\n\nThe Hallucination Cascade\n\nI asked the AI to plan the scenes based on a long story. I asked for 3 images. But the AI got \"excited\" or something and returned a plan for 22 scenes instead. Since I didn't have a hard cap on the logic yet, my code started 22 separate tasks.\n\nThe \"Zombie Worker\" Loop. \n\nThis was the real fuck up. Some of these complex generations were taking 2 minutes. My cloud provider (Supabase) has a \"self-healing\" feature. If a task takes too long, the cloud thinks it crashed and automatically restarts it.\n\nBecause I hadn't built \"Checkpointing\" (the code didn't check if it was already on its 3rd attempt after a restart), the newly born worker would start the cycle all over again.\n\nThe result of this was that one single user click triggered an infinite loop of AI agents fighting each other over shit like \"incorrect hair shading,\" with the cloud platform constantly reviving the dead processes to keep the war going. At $0.15 a generation, the bill moved fast.\n\nThe Three (very fucking expensive) Lessons (that hopefully will save you some trouble):\n\n1. AI doesn’t understand your budget. You can't trust an LLM to follow a \"Number of Images\" constraint if the input text is long. It can hallucinate scope. You must hard-code limits into your backend. If you don't have a \"Circuit Breaker\" in your code, you’re just handing your credit card to a toddler who likes to click buttons.\n2. The Cloud is a Multiplier. \"Self-healing\" cloud functions are great for uptime, but they are a nightmare for \"Leaky\" AI logic. If your code can trigger a restart without checking its own history, a small bug becomes a massive financial leak.\n3. Visibility is your only defense. If I hadn't been logging every single \"Audit Failure\" and \"Task Start\" in a forensic database, I would have had no way to explain the $700. I would have just seen a high bill and probably quit the project. Detailed logs are the only reason I was able to find exactly why what happened happened, and how to fix it without probably having to restart the whole thing (this is probablue due to me not being a developer and not being able to read code).\n\nFor now, I have plugged the leaks. I limited the AI scope, fixed the restart loops, and taught the \"Auditor\" that perfection isn't worth bankruptcy, or something like that.\n\nThe silver linings is that the \"forced\" retries actually worked—the consistency is better than ever because the AI eventually \"learned\" what I wanted.\n\nIt’s been an expensive lesson, but the output is finally something I’m proud of.\n\nWhat's your worst AI fuck-up story?",

The zombie worker loop combined with auditor retries is a nasty combo.\n\n  \nA few things that saved me after learning the hard way:\n\n  \n1. Hard spending caps on every API key - most providers let you set this. Set it lower than you think you need. You can always raise it but you cant get the money back\n\n  \n2. Circuit breakers with exponential backoff - after X failures in Y minutes, stop entirely and alert yourself. Dont let the system keep trying forever\n\n  \n3. Idempotency keys - so if a task restarts it can check if it already completed successfully instead of starting fresh\n\n  \n4. Separate dev keys with tiny limits - never use production API keys during development, its too easy to accidentally run a loop\n\n  \n5. Per-request cost tracking - log estimated cost per API call so you can see it accumulating in real time\n\n  \nThe self-healing cloud function thing is brutal. Vercel, Supabase, AWS Lambda - they all restart on timeout by default. You have to explicitly build in checkpointing to survive restarts gracefully.\n\n  \nThe silver lining is youll never make this mistake again. And the quality improvement from forced retries is real - I had a similar experience where the retries actually improved output quality because the AI learned from previous attempts.\n\n  \nWhat provider are you using for the image generation?

FAL, openai, replicate, anthropic — all of them have billing limits. set them before you write a single line of code. $50 cap would have saved you $650.\n\n2. never let AI decide how many times to run something without a circuit breaker. if your code can loop, it will loop. hardcode max retries (3-5 is usually plenty).\n\n3. for the auditor pattern specifically — there's a real concept called 'good enough' thresholds. instead of rejecting on any imperfection, score the output 0-100 and accept anything above 70. the difference between 85% and 99% consistency is usually invisible to users but costs 10x more in compute.\n\n4. set up billing alerts. every cloud provider has them. $10, $25, $50 thresholds. email + slack notification. takes 5 minutes.\n\nthe silver lining you mentioned is real though — forced retries with good logging actually produce better training signal than getting it right the first time. expensive lesson but the knowledge compounds.",

Poor project planning, I say this because while you think you reviewed the project documents you didn't review them with a panel of experts. Some of this can be automated. \n\nUltimately, better source documents means better end product. Here is an example:\n\nYou tell AI to write an application and when it comes back it's missing 24 API endpoints and 35% of the database structure, UI/UX logic, etc. \n\nWhen you properly plan this process out the AI will build out everything and keep a map to everything as well. \n\nPersonally I went backwards in time on my practices with software development using AI. I actually stumbled into the idea that if you plan everything and I really do mean every detail you can get a working finished product using some of the most complex coding languages today. \n\nI do charge for assistance on project refactoring, etc. and I'm already pretty booked up. For the right price though my schedule just opened up.\n\nI primarily focus on Secure SaaS solutions and have built several sites which the longest project was quoted to taking 2 to 3 years by a team of 6 which I had it planned and coded in less than a month. I spent the next 2 months source reviewing and verifying the logic before sending it off to the client and they were very excited. :-)\n\nThis work was under a strict NDA so I can't show off the finished work sadly.  That site was a really cool idea and they even provided me patents they already had in a pending state and asked me to see if their ideas would work and if they didn't to find an alternative way. (Yes, AI can also do that as well.)\n\nI include a final code scan to validate if it detected any patent infringement. It's not perfect of course but one thing to remember; all main steam AI models contain patents as a source. AI is able to tell you if it used a patent during development.",

A few passes of that until the plan is solid with details on all the stages of implementation. \n\nThis gives me much better results than when I used to jump straight into directly asking an agent to go something with code.\n\nThen once it's done, I'll do a few agentic audit and optimisation passes, in some cases even refactors to ensure that the codebase is neat and tidy.\n\nWorks very well for me.",

      "text": "Software development is moving fast, but AI coding tools often get stuck in **vibe coding loop.** You give an agent a prompt, it gives you code that looks *almost right*, but is broken somewhere, and you spend hrs fixing it. The problem isn't that the AI is bad, it's that it lacks solid planning.\n\n\n\n**The Problem: Intent vs. Implementation**\n\nWhen you go directly from idea to code using AI, you're asking it to guess the architectural details, edge cases, and business logic. This leads to:\n\n* **Context drift:** it fixes one bug but breaks three other files it didn't \"see\"\n* **Regression:** new features dont respect existing design patterns\n* **Wasted tokens:** endless back-and-forth prompts to fix small errors\n\n\n\n**The Solution: Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**\n\nInstead of \"code first\", SDD allows you to start with structured, versioned **specifications** that act as the single source of truth.\n\nIn SDD, you dont just describe a feature. You define phases, technical constraints, and exactly what end product looks like. Your agent then uses these specs as its roadmap. It stops guessing and starts executing against a verified plan. This ensures that the code matches your actual intent, not just a random prompt.\n\n\n\n**Why It’s Important**\n\n1. **Predictability:** you know exactly what AI is going to touch before it writes a single line.\n2. **Decomposition:** It breaks complex changes into tiny, reviewable steps that AI can handle accurately.\n3. **Traceability:** If a year from now you wonder *why* a specific logic exists, the answer is in the spec, not buried in a massive Git diff.\n\n\n\n**Suggested Tool:** [**Traycer**](https://traycer.ai/)\n\nIf you're interested in SDD approach, my top pick is Traycer. Most AI tools have their plan mode, but they still assume a lot of stuff by themselves and jump to coding phase. Traycer sits as an architect layer between you and your coding agent (like cursor, claudecode, etc).\n\n\n\n**How it solves the gap:**\n\n* **Elicitation:** It asks you questions to surface requirements you might have forgotten.\n* **Planning:** It generates a detailed implementation plan so the AI doesn't get lost in your repo.\n* **Automatic Verification:** Once the code is written, traycer verifies it against your original spec. If there’s a gap, it flags it.\n\nIt’s specifically built for large, real-world repos where *vibe coding* usually falls apart.\n\n\n\n**Other tools in the SDD space:**\n\nHere are a few other tools defining this space with different approaches:\n\n* [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/)**:** An agentic ide from aws that follows req -> design -> tasks workflow. It uses hooks to trigger bg tasks (like updating docs or tests) whenever you save a file.\n* [Tessl](https://tessl.io/)**:** Focuses on \"spec-as-source.\" It aims for a model where the code is a fully generated derivative of the spec, meaning you modify the specification, not the generated code files.\n* [BMAD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)**:** A framework that deploys a team of specialized agents (PM, architect, QA, etc) to manage the full agile lifecycle with consistent context. \n* [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)**:** Github’s opensource toolkit. It provides a CLI and templates that introduce checkpoints at every stage of the spec and implementation process.",

The problem isn't that AI is bad at coding, it's that context window sizes at inference are small relative to the size of a moderately complex codebase and the AI has a limited attention span, so it truncates and tends to get anchored on things in sometimes unhelpful ways. \n\nWhile it's definitely possible to try to provide clear instructions to the AI to try to force it in a certain direction, this is actively working against the things that make AI a powerful tool for coding. It also adds to rather than mitigates the context size problem by adding another thing the AI has to keep in its awareness. You're basically hoping that it follows your instructions and when it doesn't, you just just add \\*more\\* to the instructions and hope it follows that as well.\n\nThe way around this is to accept where the AI's true strengths lie:  \n\\- AI is great at producing code quickly  \n\\- AI is great at making tweaks to existing examples  \n\\- AI has been trained on a lot of best-practice examples of code (alongside the bad ones)\n\nWhat you want to do is create the simplest possible mechanical tool to bundle relevant code (by means of a graph or adjacency matrix representation of the codebase) for use in context. Keep context contained to O(1) regardless of codebase size by leveraging the graph. Then take advantage of the AI's strengths to iteratively improve a code snippet/file along some arbitrary guiding reward function/scoring system that very concisely lets the AI know to access the best-practice parts of the model.\n\nIf you tune this right you get living \"documentation\" that is just mechanically curated context from your actual codebase, recursive improvement both locally (at the file or code snippet level) and globally (in terms of architecture of the codebase), and minimal token usage. In the recursive refactoring process, if one AI context window misses something (a TODO comment, a security vulnerability, an extraction/abstraction opportunity, failure to follow an established pattern, etc.) then the next context window is likely to catch it. Over enough iterations (usually 3-4) the arbitrary scoring mechanism will tend to hit diminishing returns or stabilize and you end up with code that is much higher quality and better aligned with your codebase at large than you would with current agentic tools. And you don't have to write any context by hand besides a sentence or two explaining a change or addition you want.",

I use the broadly known prompting asking the agent to use layers of management (design, management, execution) and all 3 are just single-thread run in a single agent. The flaw being that this all falls apart when the project gets larger and the original chat window gets context rotted and then I start over with a new window that doesn't know the design or management plans other than the original PRD.\n\nHow do I get to what you're describing instead?",

The individual components of the approach are simple and done elsewhere, but the value is in how you combine them.\n\nI used Claude to help me build the tool I use in a couple weeks of experimentation and now I use it for all my coding (right now I'm using it on a 250k LOC codebase). I would (and am aiming to) make it open source, but it's built mainly for my particular use cases, so I would need time to polish it to apply to other coding languages and frameworks.\n\nBut the essential parts are to find a way to represent your codebase in terms of a graph of import/exports/calls and/or semantic similarity. AI can help you make simple tools like this, or there are likely many open source ones out there to try. From that you pull in the most relevant files/snippets for whatever piece of code you're working on at the moment. This could be cross-cutting concerns, reference implementations, consumers/providers, etc. The key is to use a weighted approach (or n jumps in the graph) to keep the context bounded.\n\nThen you have an arbitrary scoring framework. For example, you could use a list of things to evaluate code on like semantic clarity, abstraction, typing, security, etc. The dimensions are less important than the instruction for the AI to evaluate and look for improvements. Ask the AI to score the code and then try to improve it along the dimensions. A single context window will miss things. Multiple context windows will tend towards catching everything. After a certain number of iterations the AI scores will tend to converge and stabilize because it becomes harder for it to suggest meaningful improvements. This is usually a sign you can move on to another piece of code.\n\nUsing this approach you get the most relevant context, recursive improvement towards best practice on individual code files or snippets, emergent architectural optimization, and minimal token usage. It just takes a relatively simple mechanical (i.e. not AI) harness to do it.",

What works for me is intentional structure paired with agentic tooling.

That then becomes a `PROMPT.md` which acts as a contract between the spec and the AI.\n\nI feed both into **Warp** with my global Warp Rules. Warp plans tasks, scaffolds code in clear blocks, and lets me iterate phase by phase from architecture to APIs to features to UI. I get the speed of experimentation without unpredictable drift, so I’m not reworking everything just because an early prompt went sideways.

Context windows do not save us here haha\n\nBut I'd say just as important as specing the AI is building robust tests to ensure the outcome is fit for purpose. This includes ensuring there aren't regressions in otherwise unrelated parts of the app. I probably spend 25% of my vibe coding time just checking stuff to make sure things don't break. And even with that investment, I still occasionally ship newly broken code. Thankfully, users love speed, so these errors kinda help contribute to the founder hero aesthetic that many early adopters of new apps love, but when the real money's flowing and there are thousands of users to keep happy, it's not ideal when you add a simple feature and 10 other things break.\n\nSpecs tell the AI SWE what to do. Automated tests tell YOU whether it actually did it without breaking everything else. I learned this the hard way managing a massive app.",

I have built products like HelperBat.com (AI powered agentic scheduling assistant), MuseBattle.com (an AI literacy game), CheckIt.so (AI-powered document processing), ZeptoFlow.com (No-code AI tool builder), Lstr.cc (AI-powered list curation tools) and other things. My latest project is HelperBat and I'm looking for beta testers and will give free lifetime accounts to them.\n\nIn my experience, this is the best flow to get started on a vibe coding project. Go to [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) and say: \"I have the following rough idea for an app I want to build with Replit AI agent. Please review and critique the idea and help me work through it until you have enough information to write a complete Product Requirements Document. Here's the idea I have so far: \"\n\nOnce you have a full PRD you go to Replit, attach it and say \"let's start building!\" and once in a while you tell Replit (in planning mode) \"please refer back to the PRD and compare it with the current state of the codebase, then plan the next development sprint.\" If you have a good PRD this will get you a long way through in a very efficient manner compared to other ad-hoc YOLO approaches to vibe coding.",
