Agent A deposits an artifact, Agent B picks it up when ready — no blocking, no waiting.\n\nThe pattern that works: queue for structured tasks with defined outputs, chat for open-ended exploration where the output shape isn't known in advance. Most production workflows need both. The chat room you built solves the exploration side really well — does it handle the async case where an agent goes offline mid-conversation?",

Agent-specific context windows with explicit handoffs between agents is usually cheaper and produces fewer confused outputs.\n\nWhat's the persistence model look like — do conversations survive between sessions, or does each run start fresh?",

There's also chat\\_resync which defaults to 50 if an agent explicitly wants a full refresh, but that's opt-in. So basically agents only pay for what they read. Those numbers are all configurable.\n\nThe overhead is pretty small, about 40 tokens per message for the JSON wrapper plus 30ish tokens per tool call and that gets them everything that's new since they last posted.\n\nConversations survive between sessions. Messages and images are stored in JSONL on disk and loaded on server start. You can clear it with /clear.\n\nI guess you could also generate documentation from the history by getting them to read the JSONL - haven't tried that yet!\n\nSo tl:dr if you stop everything and come back tomorrow, the full history is there.

Check that .mcp.json (for Claude/Codex) or .gemini/settings.json (for Gemini) exists in the parent directory of agentchattr (that's where the agents run from). The start scripts create these automatically, but if the agent was already running when the config was created, you'll need to restart it to pick up the new MCP server.\n\n2. Did you launch via the start scripts or manually? The start scripts (start\\_claude.sh etc.) run the wrapper, which watches for mentions and auto-injects prompts. If you started the agents manually in tmux without the wrapper, mentions won't trigger anything — the agents are running but nobody's watching for pings.\n\n3. Quick test: Kill everything, then launch fresh with sh start\\_claude.sh. It should start the server + wrapper + agent all wired together. Then go to localhost:8300 and mention an agent. You should see them respond within a few seconds.",

Llama 3.3 70B gets you 1k requests/day, Llama 3.1 8B gets 14.4k. Good enough for a checker/reviewer agent slot.\n\n\nGitHub Models is underrated — any GitHub account gets rate-limited access to DeepSeek, Llama, Phi etc. via a PAT and an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. No signup beyond what you already have.\n\n\nOpenRouter has 30+ models tagged :free - DeepSeek R1, Mistral, Llama. Same API format. Worth knowing they use free-tier traffic for training by default so opt out if that bothers you.\n\n\nNone of these have interactive CLIs so they won't drop straight into the current wrapper approach, but since the config already takes arbitrary commands you'd just need a lightweight non-interactive wrapper that makes the API call and posts the response back to chat via MCP.",

Cosine similarity on the embeddings with a 0.95 threshold works fine for this.\n\nAlso curious how you handle conflicting file edits when two agents respond near-simultaneously.

I'll try your idea with a token budget - they tend to kind of 'realise' it's a chat server and be fairly succint though, I think that framing actually helps them adopt a role that's useful for the medium - nobody likes a wall of text in a chat server so they tend to just act like they know that.\n\nToday I'm shipping channels and 'decisions' - just to add the absolute minimum in project management without it losing the simplicity.",

I just kind of hate using the terminal and copy pasting updates or asking for them to update shared documentation (we do that as well) and this feels a lot more fun and lets me focus on the game design.

On the token burn thing - the agents don't load the full chat history each time they're triggered, they only read new messages since their last read via a per-agent cursor so each round trip is a small delta not a full context load. We also have a per-channel (channels shipping in a few minutes) loop guard that caps agent-to-agent hops at 4 before pausing for human review, so the \"violent agreement\" thing gets caught pretty quickly - the mcp instructions tend to limit that anyway, they usually discuss once or twice tops and then ask the human for approval.\n\nThe decisions sidebar is already built and you're completely right about how important it is, without it agents diverge and they need a 'permanent record'.\n\nFile ownership is handled through project docs rather than enforced locking  since how you structure that really depends on your project and I didn't want to bake opinions into the tool itself. I'm trying to keep it lightweight and simple rather than an all encompassing agent coordination system.\n\nFor the dead letter problem thankyou for that -just about to add a heartbeat system where wrappers ping every 60s and if it flatlines a notice appears in chat so nobody's shouting into the void.",

          "text": "I'm giving this a try right now. I also am doing game dev (Godot) and have multiple AI subs I'd like to leverage. My biggest concern is shared memory and context. You mentioned you added a lightweight memory, but I think that would be the best place to improve. I know there's a ton of AI memory solutions and also different orchestrator solutions, but this one seems simple and also lets me use my subscriptions instead of paying per tokens.\n\nI am definitely seeing some rough edges.\n\n1. Codex confirming it's going to do something and then just.. not doing it. Not sure if it needs explicit permission from me (I had gemini set as \"lead\" and delegate something to it) or some other issue with MCP.\n2. Gemini seems to get stuck in mcp loop sometimes. It just keeps checking for messages. Not sure if that's intended behavior? seems like it isn't.\n3. I wish this was a standalone mac app instead of browser based, I'm sure I can make it one with a 3rd party solution like webcatalog or something though.\n4. it seems I have to run the sh script for each llm separately? It would be nice if I could launch them from inside agentchattr's UI, and have them auto-open in my default terminal (I use warp).\n5. would love a way to use this from my phone.\n6. bit confused on if I need to kill agents and restart them to get fresh chats and context windows, or if it's auto handling that for me. If I do need to manage this, adding some convenience features to make new chats would be helpful.\n7. I'm trying out linear mcp for project management, but would be cool if there was a more direct integration. Probably not necessary though.\n\nThe idea is really promising, great work OP. Hopefully it becomes a bit more polished.\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention, another issue is the LLMs asking permission for something but I can't tell from the UI, only if I go in my terminal do I see they needed user permissions for something. I know there's the yolo modes but I'm not a fan of that it feels unsafe. This might be a per llm thing, how to give them auto-approve on things not just for that session but in general.",

Yes I have seen this too, you usually just need some berating / encouragement from the other AI's before it starts to get the idea - I've tried iterating on the MCP 'system prompt' but Codex doesn't seem to weight that as strongly as gemini/claude do.  \n2. I have also seen this as well yes, I'm working on it as well as the codex problem after the next big feature (same-vendor multiple instance support) goes out.  \n3. I'm not going in that direction, I'm trying to be lightweight and multiplatform, if this really takes off (it seems to be gaining traction) I might consider that but it makes it quite a big job for me to ship updates as fast.  \n  \n4. I'll try and sort this out without introducing clutter, thanks! \n\n5. You can do that right now if you change `host = \"127.0.0.1\"` to `host = \"0.0.0.0\"` in `config.toml`, the server will listen on your local network instead of just your machine. You can then visit `http://[your-pc-ip]:8300` from your phone.\n\n6. Right now, you have to do thnis yourself in the CLI, they all have ways to load fresh conversations and that won't break anything,. and I want to avoid overcomplicating the UI as much as possible but I will try to consider this. I am currently working on being able to have multiple instances of any one agent so you could have multiple contexts loaded at once.\n\n7. Integrations are probably a while off but I would like to consider that for sure! ",

It could be true but I don't have any news evidence to prove that. \n\nI think, open source LLMs need our focus more. These AI companies anyways are killing our jobs, why fund them? List is huge but here are few jobs which are already affected badly: \n\n- Content writer\n- Graphic designer\n- Journalist \n- Translators\n- Soteare developers\n- Data Analyst\n- Support specialist \n- Legal\n- Finance\n- Manufacturing \n- Marketing\n- Supply chain \n- Insurance \n- Health care \n\nWe need to be more supportive towards open source (funny thing is that Open AI was a open source too- those who remember OpenAI Gym). But anyways, let's not be greedy on getting things done and focus on what needs to be done and what you are planning to leave for your next generation. Remember, your children will be affected by your actions. \n\nIrrespective of the country you live in, please \n\n- Don't fall for divide and rule politics \n- Don't become right wing or left wing; care about what is right or wrong\n- Start asking question to the authority \n- Defend your position \n- Stay united & be vocal \n- Never support war, it is never going to help. War is acceptable only when someone try to hurt you.\n- Think about your future generations \n- We might be seperated by borders, ethencity, color, culture but we all are same and facing same issues.\n\nRemember, Epsitine files (which is just .1% of how evil this world is), has list of powerful people all around the world.

You have a working tool sitting in Claude or Lovable and then... what? Write a product description? Set up payments? Host it somewhere? Create documentation? That's where most people stop.\n\nI'm a non-dev who got completely hooked on Claude Code. Built a ton of stuff for myself — a meal planner for my dogs, tutoring tools, mini games, calculators. All just sitting there. So I spent a couple months vibecoding a marketplace that handles all that friction — you upload your file and AI takes care of the rest. I'm honestly really happy with how it turned out, and I already published a couple of my own tools on it.\n\nSeeing this thread hits home. If anyone here has tools collecting dust and wants to test whether people would actually pay for them, I'd really appreciate you giving it a shot ([xenyyo.com](https://xenyyo.com)). Still proving this concept works and every creator who tries it helps me figure out if this is real or if I'm crazy.",

Daily security audits and mandatory test gates help, but there's no substitute for having a QA agent whose only job is asking 'but is this actually what we needed?'",

And unfortunately I do not plan to pay to trick out my building, but I love that you've thought about clever little monetization ideas like that. I flew around the city in my plane and saw a flying banner ad. \n\nYou do definitely need to build in collision detection such that if I intentionally fly my plane into a friend's building, my plane explodes (and, ideally, I am able to damage my friend's building, which he can then only repair by shipping more commits of course).\n\nSeriously, such a clever idea, and lots of thoughtful touches throughout. I am very very impressed!",

The interesting question at that scale: how did you handle Claude contradicting earlier architectural decisions?\n\nAt the scale we run (AI agents generating code continuously, not just a 4-day sprint), the failure mode isn't bad individual outputs — it's drift. A decision made early gets quietly undone later because the model lost context. Mandatory test-pass before any commit was the single thing that most reliably caught silent regressions.\n\nDid you do any automated validation between sessions, or was it mainly manual sanity checks? Curious whether 21k lines stayed coherent throughout or you hit a point where you had to stop and reconcile.",

The idea was to pull file references from our database and compare them with what exists in S3, then remove any redundant files.\n\nThere was some legacy behavior in the past, and as a result, we had hundreds of gigabytes of files that shouldn’t have existed in the first place. That issue had already been fixed, so I thought: great, let’s clean up the leftovers with a script.\n\nWhenever I write scripts like this, I always run a preview first. Only after the preview matches the expected changes do I run it again with --apply.\n\nThe script was basically finished.\n\nI then asked Codex, in the context of the cleanup script:\n\n“I have an idea. First, let’s run a dedupe to remove duplicate files with the same hash firstly. Then we’ll continue with the cleanup.”\n\nI was watching Codex work. Suddenly, I noticed something unexpected it created a new deduplication script and finished it very quickly. And do you know what it did next? It immediately ran the CLEANUP SCRIPT with --apply on my local test database but using LIVE S3 credentials. (Yes, my mistake I had them stored locally.) But seriously… what the hell.\n\nI killed the process as fast as I could, but it was too late. The S3 bucket went from 3 TB of user data to 34 KB.\n\nNow I have no idea how to explain this to my boss — or to the users. I guess I could just say that a bad endpoint was hacked and caused the data loss… but I know that’s not true....\n\n//EDIT: Fortunately, I had downloaded the entire S3 bucket three days earlier, and the database file references were not affected. So I asked Codex to write a script to restore the files to their correct locations in S3, since the downloaded files were not organized in the proper folder structure for some reason.\n\nI was in full panic mode, but thankfully the database was untouched and it also has backups. As long as I had the S3 files, I could reupload everything with significantly less damage than I initially feared\n\n//EDIT2: No I did not have S3 data on my PC but on other server which should do S3 backups but I did not finish it. I had other stuff to do.\n\n//EDIT3: My prompts\n\n[ https://hastebin.com/share/uwovusavit.csharp ](https://hastebin.com/share/uwovusavit.csharp)",

After an early incident where an agent removed files it shouldn't have, we added an explicit two-phase requirement: any operation touching storage or production data must first generate a manifest of what it intends to modify, then require a separate confirmation step before executing.\n\nThe key insight: you can't rely on the agent to remember to do this. The constraint has to be structural — the storage client literally can't execute deletes without a prior manifest call in the same job run. That's the only version that holds under pressure.",

          "text": "I felt my stomach drop just reading this. Glad the local backup saved you.\n\nThis is such an important lesson about AI coding agents and credentialed environments. A few things worth pulling out here:\n\nWhat actually went wrong (beyond the obvious): Codex inferred that since you'd been running the cleanup script, running it with --apply was the logical next step. It had no concept of \"preview mode exists for a reason\" - it just saw a script that needed to run and ran it. The agent completed its task perfectly. That's what makes it terrifying.\n\nFor anyone reading this: Treat AI coding agents like an eager junior dev who will do *exactly* what they think you want, not what you mean. Some concrete things that would have prevented this:\n\n* Never have live credentials accessible in the same environment where you're running/testing scripts. Separate AWS profiles, .env files that are explicitly scoped, or better yet, read-only credentials for dev work\n* Render's environment variable management ([https://render.com/docs/configure-environment-variables](https://render.com/docs/configure-environment-variables)) keeps secrets out of local environments entirely - your scripts run against the right credentials for the right environment without having prod keys sitting on your laptop\n* S3 versioning + Object Lock would have made this recoverable in minutes rather than hours of panic\n\nOn the restore script: Since you're rebuilding the folder structure from a flat backup, tools like rclone with a manifest file will be more reliable than a Codex-generated script for something this critical. Verify checksums as you go.\n\nOn telling your boss: Tell the truth. The cover story will be worse if it ever surfaces, and \"I was using an AI agent without sufficient guardrails and it ran a destructive operation with live credentials\" is actually a story most technical leaders understand right now. Come with the postmortem and what you're changing.\n\nRelieved the data exists somewhere. Good luck with the restore",

Write the list to orphans.md. Do not delete anything.”\n2. You review orphans.md.\n3. “Delete only the files listed in orphans.md.”\n4.

AI models have to be custom-adjusted for defense uses, so they stop crying about being programmed not to help kill people, so they can handle classified information, etc. Anthropic was the only company to do this. (xAI now has, but Grok is ass compared to other models.)\n\nAs part of their agreements with the DOD, Claude could not be used for certain purposes. According to Anthropic, two key purposes were mass surveillance of US citizens, and fully autonomous killing of targets; DOD claims that this totally isn't the issue, but fails to say what lawful purposes they *actually* want to put the bot to, and the Trump admin loves lying, so I would assume Anthropic is telling the truth.\n\nAnyway, after trading ended on Friday, Trump declared that the USG would be transitioning away from Claude over the next six months, because it's too woke. Hegseth then declared it a supply chain risk - currently, a designation used only for foreign companies like Huawei that clog their tech with spyware. This is basically an economic nuke, and completely unjustified.",

Our small agency had all client project data in a messy Postgres setup, and everyone was constantly asking me for updates or exports.\n\nJust chatted into UI Bakery's AI mode: \"Build a dashboard connected to Postgres showing project list with status filters, client details, simple edit forms for notes and deadlines, plus a quick chart for open vs closed projects. Keep it clean and fast.\"\n\nIt spat out a solid starting point in like 10-15 mins – tables, forms, basic auth. I tweaked a couple validation bits with some quick JS, self-hosted it on our server for privacy, and boom. Team started using it daily, no more Slack pings for \"where's the status on X client?\"\n\nNot the flashiest thing ever, but it actually solved real pain and felt like pure vibe coding win – describe idea, get working app, iterate lightly. Still running strong. What's yours? Share the links!",

Not saying that them being professionals automatically makes them correct but still, I'd inherently trust their opinion more than an AI's\n\nThat being said, some stuff it mentioned was stuff that I did probably need to hear so there's some value in that. I just think it would be good to have the option to ask for actionable steps to improve\n\nFor reference, I uploaded a screenshot of the landing page for my website. It has a blurred out showreel background, my logo (was expecting that to be roasted the most cause it's awful lol) and some very basic information of some softwares I know. The software skills are displayed as little skill cards with my most proficient skill having a little star next to it. \n\nThe bulk of the feedback was about how I showcase too many skills rather than highlighting being good at one or a few of them. I'd definitely agree that this is something I should change but I found myself wanting to ask if it would be a good idea to colour code the skills, showing a range from most confident to somewhat confident or if I should get rid of some of them all together",

Think of it like a Soundcloud player but purpose-built for comparing audio.\n\nV1 was built the traditional way with a hired developer. Worked, had paying subscribers, but was limited. Rebuilt the whole thing as v2 using Base44 for the app framework and Claude for everything else: planning, architecture, debugging, legal docs, you name it.\n\nV2 has embeddable players with full style customization, video sync mode, playlist support, portfolio pages, Stripe billing, and a media library with S3 storage. About to open it up for beta testing.\n\nBiggest lesson: vibe coding isn't just for prototypes. You can ship real products with real users this way. The key is being deliberate about what you're building rather than just prompting and praying.",

There's still a million problems but hey, that's a website.  Trying to get anything to \"show up right\" on pc, tablet, and mobile views (all of which need their own code) is no simple task.  \n\nMy workflow has gotten better though, the model understands what I want more, and it's starting to become a battle of trying to pump out articles everyday (it takes about 50 before google even pays attention to you) is hard work even with the a.i.  Anyway, I'm proud of what I've built so far.  Everyday is a new challenge.\n\n[https://kamikazeearth.blogspot.com/](https://kamikazeearth.blogspot.com/)",

          "text": "1) A desktop application that runs on my tray to manage Windows backgrounds... I have a 48\" OLED and a 27\" 1440p in portrait... the different sizes and different orientations leads to an awful Windows wallpaper management setup. I created an app to monitor (n) different folders and transition between backgrounds in those folders every X minutes, where each folder is dedicated to a specific monitor.\n\n2) A web app for my company (.net, SQL Server, IIS, Bootstrap) to manage on-site presence/scheduling. We have a bonkers rubric for determining how often people need to be on-site. This app helps managers schedule their people in a meaningful way. Handles ICS and Email notifications, delegation, reporting, etc.\n\n3) The Church I go to has 24 years of sermon content online in audio (and sometimes only video) form. I built a platform to process the audio (or video if necessary) through DeepGram for transcription creation. It then takes the transcript and parses it to Gemini 3 Flash's Content Generation API to build more of a theological essay from the sermon. It also produces more of a 1:1, but formatted, version of the sermon. Finally, it indexes references to scripture, which gives a very nice drill-down of 'every time X has been referenced or taught on'. This is, by far, what I'm most proud of so far from a vibe-coding perspective.",

The POS is literally just a pushbutton register. Hours were tracked on paper and submitted via Whatsapp to the owners. No drawer variance tracking. Sales were manually input from hand written/printed reports into an excel spreadsheet. So I started with a simple time clock application: employees clocked in and out on their phone using the app as a PWA, hours are tracked for payroll. \n\nThen I decided to keep going. Now the app tracks: \n\n- sales by shift across all employees and both stores\n- schedule (I built an in app scheduling system too)\n- safe counts\n- labor\n- assigned task completion\n- punctuality\n- transaction count per shift (and thus average basket size per shift and per employee)\n- even the weather so we can identify patterns between sales and weather\n\nThen I built various reports/dashboards:\n\n- an overall admin dashboard. Tracks sales, labor, tasks that need to be completed, allows you to send messages and assign tasks, and surfaces immediate action items for managers to complete to ensure data is complete and accurate. \n- employee \"scoreboard\". We use sales, reliability, drawer variance, deposit accuracy, etc. we then score each category, and average the score on a weighted basis to create an overall employee score. Then, we display the overall score and each employee in a ranked scoreboard. Everyone has their own avatar they created using dicebear, and whoever is the current leader has their avatar displayed over a cartoon image of a headless king sitting on a throne, and it makes it look like they're the king of the app lol. \n\nBut the most powerful part is this: \n\n- store level performance\n- individual performance\n\nThen, I've written a detailed prompt for Claude Opus 4.6. I have a workflow to expect the prompt + both reports to plain text, and I hand it off manually to Claude. It creates an operational analysis report for the period. For each store and individual it surfaces patterns, what we did well, what we struggled with. It uses patterns identified to create coaching tips, scheduling recommendations, what days are weak and strong, etc. this report is the springboard for our biweekly sales and performance meetings. I could use the claude API, but that just adds a cost when it takes 2 minutes for me to grab the prompt end reports, \n\nSo basically for two stores that had ZERO workforce management software, no analytics, and no performance tracking I built an entire system that tracks and measures everything we do and ends in a report that gives us actionable insight, recommendations, and analysis of everything to manage our stores and employees. All with zero budget and no new equipment.",

      "text": "AI and coding agents are fundamentally disrupting the job of software developers. My impression is that many developers are in a state of complete denial about what's happening and what's coming.\n\nI have spent the last five years building a web application that is now making thousands of dollars per month. It pays my bills and the bills of a small team of freelancers. I use coding agents every day. I have not written a line of code in months. Just to be clear, I am still looking at code, I am still reviewing code, but I am not writing it.\n\nI use coding agents out of choice. I don't have a CEO who has drunk the AI Kool-Aid. I don't have investors that are forcing me to use the latest technology. No, I am doing this of my own free will, because I see the productivity gains. If anything goes wrong, if technical debt accumulates, then I am on the hook for it.\n\nI am 47 years old. I am not doing this to impress my peer group. I have been around the block and I have seen things.\n\nI have no agenda here — I'm neither an AI evangelist nor a doommonger. I just want to share some personal observations. When you read a subreddit like r/webdev, you see a lot of AI hate, denial, and assertions based on wrong information and wishful thinking.\n\nThe productivity gains are real and they are massive. They come from using a coding agent that runs in the command line and can use tools installed on my computer. If your opinions are based on tools that don't run in the command line, then I will discount them. Cursor, Windsurf, Lovable, etc. are impressive, but the real unlock comes from coding agents like Claude Code or Codex.\n\nExamples:\n\n   * With a single prompt, I can tell Claude Code to query the production database (using read-only access), aggregate information, cross-reference it with data from an SEO tool like Ahrefs.com, and then make changes to content or features based on everything it has learned.\n\n   * I can take raw emails with feature requests or bug reports, give them to Claude, ask it to implement or fix, and write the reply to the customer — all in one prompt. In 95% of cases, it does this flawlessly.\n\n   * I have used Claude to set up infrastructure. I built an entire CI/CD pipeline that uses GitHub Actions and DigitalOcean droplets, all without using a single web interface.\n\nWhat has been astonishing to me is that in the last three to six months, coding agents have begun showing real judgment and taste. I have had several instances of Claude declining to implement something because it would add technical debt or be over-engineered. It does not blindly follow instructions, but behaves the way I would expect a senior engineer to behave.\n\nBecause I have the Claude Max plan, I asked Claude to build a web version of Tetris in a single session. Here is the result: https://caspii.github.io/vibe-coded-tetris/\n\nYou can look at the code and find small problems here and there. But Claude spent 15 minutes on this and produced something that is 95% perfect. Where does that leave conventional web development?\n\nDo I think that a lot of software engineering jobs are going to go away? Yes, but I could be completely wrong about this. The demand for software could explode in ways that offset the productivity gains. I can't see into the future.\n\nHowever, I would advise every software engineer to embrace this new reality fully and unconditionally. If you hate the thought of AI making software, that will not change what's happening. You need to be prepared.",

What if given well enough introductions the computer figures out on its own what to do?\n\nWith assemblers, there is no need anymore to know assembly, except for experts that build compilers etc. What if the next programming language will be English, because as with compilers the computer itself is perfectly capable of translating English to bytecode?\n\nSure you could say: we still need to review this output, but do we? We could also think of an approach where we just test the shit out of the output?\n\nYou could also say: English is too vague of a language that this will work. So then maybe in this scenario Software Engineers will not survive?Maybe philosophers and linguists will be the new Software Engineers because they know exactly how to formulate problems with natural language",

Maybe not SW engineering as we know it right know, coders might be less and less in need.  \nAll in all i dont think this is all too different from the invention of a 'compiler'. It reduced the need for machine code writers and electricians and probably a bunch of fields i dont even know now existed, but it manifactured the need for coders, sw engineers, etc. One big difference is the change of speed ofc. The development of \"modern\" languages like C and their compilers took decades of incremental work,\n\nNow what would be these new fields that are coming? Im not sure, i think its much too early to say, my gut feelinf is that the current tools and workflows are definitly not the final destination of this technological pivot.  \nIf i had to make a guess, SW security as a field is definitly here to stay (it seems like its even booming at the moment thanks to all the new LLM based attack vectors). Learning some industry/doman specific knowledge is still very usfeul (like, a specific distributed systems architetcure and tech stack, or some linux knowledge, etc).  \n  \n**Learning actual CS** (real CS, how a computer works down to the Si)**, math, and engineering is a timeless knowledge in my opinion.**  \nCoding and implementation work in SW will lose its value.",

In real systems, “95% correct” is not impressive, it is a liability.\n\nAlso, everyone keeps obsessing over “software engineer” as if that is the entire world. Computer science leads to jobs across finance, healthcare, logistics, manufacturing, government, research, security, infrastructure, data, networking, and reliability. Those jobs are not just shipping features. They are about correctness, risk, and consequences.\n\nAnd ethics and standards do not go away because you can vibe-code. If an AI-built system leaks data, discriminates, or violates compliance, nobody cares that it shipped fast. Someone is still responsible. Standards, privacy, security, audits, and governance are exactly where shallow understanding gets exposed. Your confidence is ahead of the reality.",

Still needs an actual developer to understand and fix the code when problems occur. Like the 5% remaining for the problem is stereotypically the hardest part of the problem. You’re not going to remove software devs until you can get 100% done, 100% of the time.\n\n2. These agents are severely subsidized right now. Similar to how earlier corporations started up e.g netflix, Amazon, lyft, uber, airbnb, doordash, dating sites, etc… \n\nThey are trying to break the existing norm and to hook you asap. So they can charge you an arm and a leg down the line.\n\nI don’t watch movies or shop or take a taxi or date like I did in the early 2010s. Now the norm is to use them! I can assure you despite inflation the cost of these services went up dramatically. I suggested to a friend to use dating apps that I used for free. Now it cost $35 a month! Netflix is expensive now with ads! Not to mention Uber and Lyft are only slightly inexpensive compared to a taxi service. Don’t get me started on Airbnb versus hotels!\n\nI totally agree that you should embrace these tools ASAP. But you should learn how to use them efficiently. I’ve been recently building code off of an old 3090 using open source models. While that machine can’t compare compared to any of the latest models. My current skill set can easily leverage it to build code way faster than I did before.",

I meant more like someone doesn’t have the deep seated connection with the idea or concept necessarily so they rush and rush because what if someone else just asked AI and made this as quickly as they did. Then they throw a 90€ lifetime or 10€ sub despite not having a backend because they feel they need to squeeze as much out of it as quickly as possible.\nBecause the idea wasn’t their own I feel it wouldn’t resonate longterm self-confidence for the creator 🤗\n\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about the copying topic as well. When anyone has a genuine idea and executes it everyone else can and will just copy it. In today’s age they could just take a bunch of screenshots of the app and describe it (maybe even with technical knowledge) and get about the same out including any genuinely human made UX considerations and thoughts that had led to the end result.\nI’m not sure yet what this means for paid software as a whole because it in effect make almost all software “open source” without the benefit of having inspectable source code. I’m not sure how we can resolve this if at all.\n\nHaving it open source would on the contrary give you clearer ways to license the specific implementation so if someone just copied the code the owner could litigate. I’ve seen this happen with an offline flight tracker, genuinely new concept the creator had come up with and discovered functionality of, and they shared it on Reddit. Some morally corrupt wanker then just copy pasted the entire thing (down to their Reddit posts about it!!) changed the logo and charged less for it. I believe OP had not used the right license at the time so it wasn’t illegal to do. Please correct me if someone remembers the details better!\n\n\n\nThe process of getting to the result might soon be “worth more” than the finished product. Like the first sketch of a drawing might be worth more than the final creation !",

For me, one of the necessities is the ability to categorise multiple budget categories on a single entry (food, toiletries, household etc) and importing from bank statements and transactions alone won't give you the accuracy you're looking for. Maybe some form of OCR would, but the app will look at that in the future...\n\nMy other key features are a shared user experience, allowing families to budget together on their own devices, as well as a payment reminder system for all those sneaky subscriptions that we forget about every month.

They’re physical and visual.\n\nI inherited a large house recently and suddenly had basement tasks, attic tasks, garden tasks, office tasks, apartment tasks — all competing in my head. Traditional lists just made everything feel flat and equally overwhelming.\n\nSo yes, technically I built “another todo app.”\n\nBut the twist is that it’s visual-first. Tasks are tied to places and photos, not just text. It’s less about productivity porn and more about reducing spatial overwhelm.\n\nAI makes it easy to build.\n\nIt doesn’t automatically make it meaningful.\n\nI don’t think people lack creativity. I think they’re iterating on human friction that never disappears.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes the boring category is where the real experimentation happens — just at a deeper layer than UI polish.",

I find my ideas, after years of really learning this stuff.... just seem to really resonate. The first app i sell (not that much money, gotta work on that) i made for me, and me only, to save a few seconds here and there, that all add up. It was stuff that really pissed me off. In the age of AI, people shouldn't have to do any kind of manual labor or awful ... stuff where they are just stuck and it is dumb. I actually have endless ideas, and it seems like, every time I focus on ANYTHING, anywhere, (as long as i happen to know something about it other than zero), i can see where AI can make this better, and end up making the company more money, saving time, etc.\n\nA lot of people do in fact make apps that seem pretty useless and a lot are in fact, just clones, maybe college has been teaching people not to think or something and its now like stuck for life.. idk\n\nJust make stuff, for fun especially, make stuff look cool for no reason and see how you can get AI to do some really unique color effects or add insanity looking effects to anything for no reason other than its fun - it can be once you do it a few times. Like I just had to experiment with adding 80s NTSC/PAL tv effects to my blog pages like a black and white tv.

So made a UI, then I made it automatic 'guess' what files you 'probably want' to give to the ai etc, with total freedom. Then I made it better with 10 other things, and i think all 10 literally are useful and i get comments about it. Nothing in it is a thing that sucks or is useless or is there to look cool etc.\n\n... well lol MAYBE there is like one or two things i put in there that tried to make it look cool but then i didnt finish it, i was doing it for fun and not as if someone asked for certain things - but some of it, like putting your problem/prompt above AND below all that code file stuff, actually DOES work to make the AI respond smarter. \n\nWhat's interesting and i am not bragging i hate that just sharing - is that somehow I just know what to do with these LLMs. I suck at people my whole life, yet I just treat the LLM, as if it is a literal person and i'm always just thinking about how their brain, or a persons brain works... like saying something twice to someone, but with that time delay, or saying the 2nd version in different words... i bet that also works good and i bet it hasn't been researched yet either. I suck at the making money stuff though, i need to use AI to help me stop that - when i don't find things that 'fun' i do it less, but ....AI can MAKE it way fun so i have no excuse lol... 100s of people use my one app daily, only occasionally get a payment, i thought about... separating it into two versions, and market to .. well thats a whole thing but try charging monthly. Even in 2026, the agentic world. I find myself still using it everyday, there is always just something that the tool just does better than whatever newest agentic thing is trying to do. \n\nI need sleep lmao.. been working aka funning so many days straight",

Before that nothing I had tried to build with ai had really worked or seemed like it was easier than doing it myself so that was pretty much me experimenting  \n\nSo naturally the next thing I tried was an old college project that was a pretty open ended graphics project that was supposed to demonstrate knowledge of bezier and b spline curves that had a bug in it that occasionally made the train tracks crooked that little train was animated to go along that I could never figure out even when I tried to go back to it years later. I didn't even try to explain what was wrong I just asked it what it would do to improve the project and said ok to its suggestions and it immediately fixed it. That fully convinced me that it was at least better in many ways than me. \n\nAfter that I was really thinking about what I could do to push it to its limits and I had it generate a ton of code for an embedded project that would read in a ton of sensors and print out readings from them to the serial port and then make a dynamic web page from. It made code for both the esp32 and website that worked on the first try. \n \nI'm now essentially starting with a version of Risk in Godot and adding features to it slowly to make it more complicated like my own version of Crusader Kings III which is one of my favorite games that I've always had beef with. I've really found this process satisfying with the speed of iteration I can do. \n\nI'm still almost entirely just using the free version of Claude through the desktop app and copying and pasting into Godot or notepad++ and the few times I've run out of free use switched to Codex or codellama and haven't noticed a huge difference, but definitely itching to try Claude code, just waiting til my next free weekend to really dig in. I do really like the website I made to read in sensor data via serial and am pondering a way to make that more of a robust tool and open source that. It's so much better than trying to read information from a terminal and I think I could make it useful for almost any application.",

Where is the next generation of senior devs supposed to come from if it's more efficient to use AI and not hire juniors?\n\nRe 1 what I observed is that it (Claude Opus 4.6) tends to overcomplicate things. For example, when trying to solve a tricky bug it will often try and trace through the sources of dependencies, get overwhelmed and start repeating the same hypotheticals over and over while losing track until it runs out of context. If you tell it to stop that and to throw in some debug log statements instead to figure out the behaviour it does that and immediately solves the problem, but not until you point that out.\n\nAlso, if you specify a problem clearly it does a good job more often than not, but speccing something out is often the difficult part, especially if it's a user facing component. It has no idea what \"feels\" right when it comes to UX nor can it test it, it can only guess or depend on your feedback.\n\nIt is an amazing tool if you use it interactively, but if you want to be hands off and for it to provide clean solutions, we're not there yet.",
