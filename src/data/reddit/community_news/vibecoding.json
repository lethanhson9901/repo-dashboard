                  "text": "My argument is always that vibe coding actually typically reduces tech debt when you pan out how things happen in real life. I worked in a think-tank that was brought in to startups to implement or fix something for years, so I got to see the actual live codebase of at least fifty startups.\n\nTypically two scenarios in a startup:\n\nWithout vibe coding. You take time off work or work overtime for months to get a minimum viable product for investors. You're either operating on a super tight budget because you're not working or you're strapped for time because you're working at 10PM after working all day. This prioritizes cutting corners and the resulting code has a shitload of tech debt. When you finally get funding, you've invested hundreds of hours into the codebase, so you typically make it work and just have to live with the problems.\n\nWith vibe coding. You rip out an MVP in a few weeks easily. Vibe coding is excellent at getting a quick idea materialized fast, it struggles later when the project is very complex. This puts you into the funding stage really fast and you can usually be doing this while you're also employed, so you can take your time and often get a better investment deal. When you finally get funding, you can basically discard your original MVP and use it to plan the full project. This makes the full project have way less tech debt because the vibe coded MVP is kind of a \"draft\".",

If you can explain it, you can own it—otherwise it’s a demo. Waitress debugging is cool; next time order observability, rollbacks, and alarms too. I use AI for boilerplate and ideas, but architecture, data flow, and failure modes must be clear. Iterate fast, not lazy. Fun ≠ robust; easy ≠ maintainable. Vibe then discipline—that’s truly next level.",

Then I started giving both CP and CC the same prompts to see how they’d diagnose and fix the issue. Found out that CC was working on a stale version hence why it broke my app and then still couldn’t solve it after 14+ hours. (I liked to switch between Cursor and CC sometimes to compare outputs.) But there was no reason for it to be not be on the correct branch. I had to provide a screenshot from git for it to believe that I really was on 5 commits after the one it thought I was on. \n\nBefore that I noticed that a large chunk of work CC had done just disappeared, at least the chat history did after the page refreshed on its own. But when I asked for a rundown of recent commits it was able to recall them but it turned out later that a group of them had not been pushed as expected despite CC telling me they were. To be fair I should have paid more attention to the fact they clearly state it’s still in beta.\n\nI’m a coding novice who is bootstrapping so until I can hire a dev I am learning by using the different tools. However after this catastrophe I am a CP believer now. And from what I’ve seen Google is doing I cannot believe that Claude would be ahead here.\n\nAlso I think her point is more about the different opinions delaying the work than them not being able to do it.",

While watching the movie White Christmas I vibe coded a 2D map designer that allowed me to define buildings,  roads and place vehicles. I spent a few hours after the movie cleaning it up.  Later in the week I thought I'd see of I could get 3D working. With Codex it took me about 5 hours ( most of that is codex writing the code). So, over the break i took a couple of days and architected an object movement manager and then a multi stage task manager. I then added a 3D model catalog manager that can import GLTF 3D models. Then I set up a demo mode where random tasks are assigned to different objects (e.g. drive from one place to another,  pick up an object and deliver it elsewhere). Oh yeah, I added A* path finding and collision detection.  The whole thing is working extremely well, as a PoC. If I tried to do this all manually it would have taken me 6 months.

I tried zero shoting a marketing site (Astro based) with different agents in Windsurf. I gave them all access to a iOS code base with dozens of MD files and 60k+ lines of swift codes. Here are my ranking for the agents:\n\n1. Claude Opus 4.5 - by far the best UI. It also understands and emphasize what is special about the app in individual section of the UI that really stands out. Didn’t use the color theme of the app tho. \n\n2. GPT 5.2 High (Xhigh took too long) - UI is pretty good. It captures the colors and theme of the app and even includes a drop down from the website to change themes just like the app. But the UI design is a bit lacking as it flatmaps a lot of features of the app in the UI. It’s a bit uninspiring, and requires a lot of redesign to be a marketing site.\n\n3. Gemini 3 Pro - by far the worst. It can be a very barebones starting point, but needs a lot more work. It also didn’t follow my instructions well and cheated by checking out gpt5.2’s work while in progress. I also had a lot of hallucination problems with it with other stuffs. Honestly I’d skip Gemini 3 Pro for coding and use it as a part time advisor.",

All the money is not going into designing the best chatting or image generation tools, but codding tools.\n\nBecause once humans are no longer needed to create a new generation of AI, AI improvement will explode by developing itself. And then from this point on replacement of all other jobs can start meaning that this is where AI companies will earn the most.\n\nIf AI today is replacing other jobs faster than programmer's jobs (and i do not think that it is the case) it is just byproduct scenario of what they are really trying to accomplish.  \nBy design programming jobs should be the first one to go.",

DigitalOcean scales with a click. I have CC do security audits. Surprisingly effective.\n\nDeploy pipeline? GitHub actions. Observability? Grafana, Loki, Prometheus. I don’t even know what the fuck the second two are, but I have a dashboard with all my logging and metrics. One time, it took my dev team of professional devs six months to setup a Kubernetes deploy pipeline. What a fucking nightmare that was.\n\nLetta took an afternoon to create an agent. Making the agent unique to users was about 15 minutes. The agent has a full scale RAG memory and tools integrated into my app.\n\nI decided to setup account sync and trading this weekend. I setup SnapTrade while building an IKEA dresser. Most of my time will be spent in Figma doing the design work.\n\nThe young ones here don’t realize how incredibly difficult this was a decade ago. Like Ruby on Rails and as revolutionary because it cut out a ton of BS but this is 1000x of a game changer than RoR, Wordpress, or React was. \n\nSure there are risks to sort through, but I’ve been doing product work for two decades.

So I feel that's how vibe-coding must be used, you know some skill and you enhance its implementation using AI to get way better results.  \nBut the way they market vibe-coding as something that one using it can create multi-million dollar SaaS products with 3 nights of prompts is what makes it so hated.

          "text": "I'm not a software developer nor am I a hardcore vibe coder; I've played around with it. However, I am in IT. I understand the difference between a development environment and a production environment. So I see merits in both sides of the argument. It is fun to build something that wouldn't have been possible before AI. Like wanting to make a song, but not having any musical talent. You can hear the song in your head, but you can't reproduce it in the real world. AI let's all that happen. It can be intoxicating.\n\nHowever, I can also see the concern for a flood of garbage on the market. If every app in the app stores were vibe coded by someone with zero knowledge, then the risk of leaks and hacks would increase exponentially.\n\nSo, the problem isn't AI or making things with its help. It's just a tool, like a hammer. It'll do what you tell it to do. The problem is people thinking that they don't need to know jack shit to put something into production. That's not going to go well, in any scenario. \n\nThe solution is to work in a development environment and actually learn while building. It's called due diligence and it's encouraged in any industry. I don't think the argument is that you need to be a senior developer to build an app. Rather, you need to build an app like a senior developer, if that makes sense.\n\nFor example, I started a project to see if I could build a .NET app that would integrate with GitHub and act as a PowerShell script repository, with dynamic updates and what not. Now, I know very little about writing C# code. However, being in IT, I know I needed unit tests and a CI/CD pipeline. I also know I needed authentication of some type, 2FA, and role based access. Not only to protect the repository, but also, I have some PowerShell scripts that will bring an entire network to its knees if not used by someone with the proper knowledge. Anyhoo, my point being, I had to have knowledge of all of that, understand what it means, and know how to tell AI how to do it. That brings me to my next point: The codebase got so complex that Claude Sonnet could no longer handle it. I think I'll have to continue with Claude Opus, at this point, which I don't have access to, ATM. But, I wouldn't know that Claude was struggling if I wasn't paying attention to what it was doing and outputting.\n\nAnyway, I think that's the criticism that the developers are offering; some more curmudgeonly than others, but mostly the same point. It's not that vibe coding is bad. You just need to know what you're doing still, before entering the production environment, especially if you care at all about your customers/users.",

Congrats on shipping and getting that first customer.\n\nI'm also building with Claude + Cursor (49, zero coding background before March 2024, now have 2 apps live with paying customers). So I get the excitement of \"holy shit, this actually works.\"\n\nBut I also want to address the concern in the comments, because it's valid:\n\nVibe coding is incredible for getting things built. But when real money and user data are involved, there's a responsibility layer that AI tools don't automatically handle.\n\nWhat I've learned shipping AI-built products:\n\nTest the hell out of payment flows. I use Stripe, and I spent days testing every edge case. Failed payments, refunds, subscription cancellations, webhook failures. AI writes the initial code, but I test like my reputation depends on it (because it does).\n\nSecurity isn't optional. Even if you don't understand the code, you need to understand what the code is doing with user data. Read through the authentication logic. Understand where data is stored. Use established services (Supabase, Stripe, Auth0) that handle the hard security stuff.\n\n\"Codebase is probably a mess\" is fine for MVP, but... once you have paying customers, you need to either learn enough to maintain it safely OR hire someone to audit the critical paths (auth, payments, data handling).\n\nThe \"fix this error pls\" approach works until it doesn't. For features, it's great. For security and payment handling, you need to actually understand what's happening, not just that \"it works.\"\n\nHere's my personal rule:\n\n\\- Vibe coding for: Features, UI, business logic, integrations, 90% of the app\n\n\\- Extra careful with: Authentication, payments, user data, anything that could harm someone if it breaks\n\nThis isn't anti-vibe-coding. I've built everything with AI tools. But I also know I'm responsible for what ships.\n\nYour app working and getting customers is awesome. Just make sure you're also:\n\n✅ Using Stripe or similar (not handling card data yourself)\n\n✅ Have proper error handling on payment flows\n\n✅ Following App Store guidelines on subscriptions\n\n✅ Can respond if something breaks at 2 AM\n\nThe community celebrating vibe coding wins is great. But we also need to be honest about the responsibility that comes with real users and real money.\n\nCongrats on the first customer. Now the real work begins: keeping them happy and safe.\n\nWhat are you using for payments and backend? Happy to share what's worked for me if helpful.",

If you combine the huge power of these models with the knowledge/experience of real developers, you can become super-human. One dev can basically achieve what was previously possible by a team of devs in the fraction of cost/time, without compromising on code quality / tech debt.\n\nAt this point \"vibe coding\" or \"AI assisted coding\" (if you want to sound \"serious\") should be the norm, not something to make fun of, and anyone who knows what he/she's doing, can become a beast.",

Run up thousands in API charges. Use it for anything they want.\n\nThis isn't a vibe coding problem. It's a fundamentals problem.\n\nYour app should never know your secrets. Ever.\n\n**The fix is simple:** run a backend proxy. App calls your server, server authenticate your app, calls OpenAI. Keys stay on your server where they belong.\n\nAll that speed means nothing if your API key ends up on GitHub or worse.",

              "text": "This is a great question that reveals an incomplete understanding.  Let me try to round you out.  The issue is not really about .env or not, instead it's really about whether your secret is embedded and available to the client-side code or the server-side code.  Server side is more secure, and generally you're gonna be fine using .env there.\n\nIf you're reading this and you're already lost, go ask your AI to explain to you which parts of your code are server-side, which parts are clientside.  These fancy web frameworks these days blend the two so it's understandable newcomers just think it's all the same, and if you truly vibecoded your app beginning to end, odds are it'll be using something like Next.js etc, and you'll eventually confuse the two when trying to vibe out some new feature.\n\nAnyways, what happens clientside is that that code often gets delivered to the users browser - wholesale - html, js, css and all, and what happens is unaware developers will accidentally include/bundle secrets in that js.  Yes \"production\" builds of that js can often be minified, but that doesn't actually change the key if it's included - afterall, if you think about it, you need your js to still make valid API calls.  Web frameworks do this because sometimes you don't care for your pages to be webscraper friendly, and instead sending along all that js actually allows that js to run, making the user experience change and by dynamic without ever needing to actually communicate with the server.\n\nThis is where the risk is, you may inadvertently be including a client that calls out to something else, and oops! Client needs it's API key or token or whatever, oh you'll just import it no big deal right? Whelp there you have it.  When this runs, your secret param is resolved, and hiding in the JS of your page.  It's a mistake I've seen dozens of times from people just learning these modern \"hybrid\" style web technologies - even well before vibe coding was a thing.\n\nHonestly, in my experience, this is a far more common oversight than committing your secrets to git.  A few other comments mentioned using something other than .env - it's important to know in web development none of those will save you if you don't fundamentally understand the difference between client-side code, and server side code.",

      "text": "Since vibe coding came into existence, I have been experimenting with building products a lot. Some of my products were consumer facing and some.. well, internal clones of expensive software. However, since beginning, I knew one big thing - **the vibe stack was expensive.**\n\n  \nI initially tried a lot of tools - Bolt, v0, Replit, Lovable, etc. out of which Replit game me the best results (yes, I can be biased due to my selection of applications). **But I often paid anywhere from $25-$200/mo. Other costs like API, models, etc. made monthly bills upward of $300/mo.** Was it cost effective when compared to hiring a developer? Yes. Was it value for money? NO.\n\n  \nSo, over the months, I optimised by complete stack to be either free (or minimal cost) for internal use or stay at a much lean cost for consumer-facing products. \n\nHere's how the whole stack looks today - \n\n1. IDE - [Google's AntiGravity](https://antigravity.google) (100% free + higher access if you use student ID)\n\n2. AI Documentation - [SuperDocs](https://superdocs.cloud) (100% free & open source)\n\n3. Database - [Supabase](http://supabase.com) (Nano plan free, enough for basic needs)\n\n4. Authentication - [Stack Auth](http://stack-auth.com) (Free upto 10K users)\n\n5. LLM (AI Model) - [OpenRouter](http://openrouter.ai) or [Gemini via AI Studio](http://aistudio.google.com) for testing and a custom tuned model by [Unsloth AI](http://unsloth.ai) for production. (You can fine-tune models using Unsloth literal in a Google Colab Notebook)\n\n6. Version Maintenance/Distribution  - [Github](http://GitHub.com)/[Gitlab](http://gitlab.com) (both totally free and open source)\n\n7. Faster Deployment - [Vercel](http://Vercel.com) (Free Tier Enough for Hobbyists)\n\n8. Analytics - [PostHog](http://posthog.com), [Microsoft Clarity](http://clarity.microsoft.com) & [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com) (All 3 are free and independent for different tracking, I recommend using all of them)\n\n  \nThat's the list devs! I know I might have missed something. If yes, just ask me up or list them up in the comments. If you have any questions related to something specific, ask me up as well. ",

The preview you see on screen is way lower resolution than what gets exported, so I had to build two separate render paths and keep them perfectly in sync. Tricky, but satisfying when it clicked.\n\nThe terrain shading was the most fun to implement. It uses Terrain-RGB tiles where each pixel's color encodes elevation, then runs it through a hillshading algorithm on the GPU. The shadows and highlights adapt to whatever color palette you pick, so it actually looks integrated rather than like a generic overlay slapped on top.\n\n**Stack:**\n\n* Next.js 16 + Tailwind\n* MapLibre GL JS (via React Map GL)\n* OpenStreetMap data via OpenFreeMap\n* Nominatim for geocoding\n* MapTiler Terrain-RGB tiles\n\n**Why it's free:**\n\nIt's 100% frontend. No backend, no database, no auth. Runs on Vercel's free tier. I pay nothing to keep it alive.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. Drop a location in the comments and I'll generate one if you want to see a specific style\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbf090x9bhag1.png?width=5400&format=png&auto=webp&s=3681fb045924c84ed3c3cf70d35679232b6cdb71\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2r22kidpbhag1.jpg?width=5400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccdad5bb13824cd1123effb63c421be29ef23979",

My dev team will also review it (with AI lol) so they'll point out anything alarming.\n\nDude.... That last part... Holy shit man. If you're building anything bigger than a simple script, Claude Code is absolutely in a different galaxy compared to copying and pasting.\n\nAre you familiar with it? It lives in your terminal. It accesses your entire codebase, and edits all relevant files for you. No copying+pasting. Just watch it do all the work for you. No more worrying about indentations on pasting.\n\nAnd Claude Code's abilities are absolutely mind blowing. I ask it stuff, and it tracks the logic through every step of my entire gigantic code base. Then it cleanly and perfectly spits out the right code changes. Sure sometimes it takes some massaging, but in general, it can one-shot really big tasks.\n\nI've been using it for months, but I still routinely laugh out loud at its abilities. It traces things so carefully. It'll scan through 15 files and then say \"Okay I've figured it out! In step 7 of your ETL, you didn't ztype this variable, which is required once step 11 executes and searches for it. That's what was causing the issue! I'll fix it now.\"\n\nGet your company to pay for the $100/month Max plan if you can. Or at least the lower-cost version. It's SO WORTH IT!",

I’m extremely lucky.\n\nIt helps that I churn out amazing work products for them consistently, so they don’t care to check in on me.\n\nPlus I made sure to negotiate all pay increase structures before handing over my code heh. I intentionally kept putting it off until we agreed to the pay structure. I got a bonus for handing over the code, then I’ll get the monthly payout (25% of the cost of the tool) once we roll it out to the whole company in a few months. I’ll also get another one-time bonus after a successful rollout.\n\nI completely agree - My speed has increased exponentially over time. I think if I started from scratch today, I could rebuild the whole thing in a month or less. That’s why I don’t even care about  handing them the code base. I’d probably build it even better today with my current knowledge vs my literal 0 knowledge when I started 9 months ago\n\nIt definitely feels like a hobby, but the real world products it can create are very real/useful!

          "text": "I have to say it's really bizarre to see this sub's demo embrace AI, yet reject all crypto use-cases. Usually the people who are against one are against both (ie, \"crypto is a scam, Sam Altman is a scammer\" or \"btc mining wastes energy, AI datacenters waste energy\".  \n\nInstead its really segregated, and I'm quite surprised that a vibecoding sub (or any AI subs) still distance themselves from blockchain integration in projects.  Feels narrow-minded.  Especially since BTC has been around for almost 20 years now, and with the incoming signing of the CLARITY Act in the USA this year, using stablecoins is going to be much more commonplace soon.\n\nAnyways, I vibe coded a game that let's you buy game pieces with crypto. I've made some money from that, without having to deal with stripe or online payment vendor integration.  Making it was fun as hell.  https://www.chaoschess.online",

Demand is there with proper marketing, it just needs to be done correctly across the spectrum of business stuff (so proper combo of price x value of the product x cost savings while keeping quality top notch). \n\nstep outside of the bubble of 'i need to create saas to get rich'. Yep, saas can make you rich (v. rich) if you're lucky enough to hit the market pain point - but now when people can build tiny saas for their own needs the demand is elsewhere. Actually - teaching people on how to use AI combined with creating a microautomations is IMO the key to getting rich with AI (what im also doing recently), but vibecoding itself can be very beneficial once you start to think outside of the box (with a bit of luck and a ton of research on how to do things efficiently and for cheap).",

      "text": "Last year was my official “vibe coding era”.\n\nYou know the drill.  \nFriday night, some random idea, open Cursor or Replit, talk to an LLM, and by 2 a.m. you have a “working” app that only crashes on every third click. I did that with todo apps, mini CRMs, dashboards for made up data, you name it.\n\nIt was fun, and honestly it made me better at thinking in systems, but when the year ended I realised something a bit sad:\n\nI had a graveyard full of half-finished vibe coded projects and not a single thing I actually used every day.\n\nSo my New Year deal with myself is different.  \nThis year I want at least one vibe coded thing that survives January.\n\nRight now I am doing it like this:\n\n* I still vibe code the logic and ideas with an LLM, because that is the fun part\n* but when it starts looking promising, I move it into something a bit more serious so it does not fall apart the moment I add real data or real users\n\nFor internal style stuff I have been experimenting with UI Bakery for that second step. My little resolution project is a small B2B-ish tool on top of a real Postgres DB. I let the AI inside UI Bakery scaffold the UI and workflows, then I go in and fix the weird bits by hand. It still feels like vibe coding, just with a slightly more grown up frame around it.\n\nI am not trying to turn this into a “use X, Y is bad” post. If anything, last year taught me that the tool matters less than the loop:\n\nidea → messy AI sketch → clean up → actually use it\n\nCurious how everyone else is starting the year:\n\nAre you planning to keep pure vibe coding for fun prototypes  \nAre you trying to turn any of your LLM-born monsters into real products or internal tools  \nAnd if you already did that, what stack did you end up with in the end\n\nWould love to read some “I finally turned my cursed weekend project into something real” stories to kick off the year.",

In the end of the day, it's just \"Having a clear idea of what you want\" and what it brings to the table and pushing through it until you have exactly what you want and what solves your problem. I don't really vibe code, but I do a lot of agentic coding, and I feel like the nuance is given to the creative power you hand over to the AI. I am working on a couple of solution (two for work, one passion project and a thing that matches 100% of my needs on a specific thing) and they're all thought as fully fledge products first. It can never be \"Hey Claude Code, make me an app\", it's : massive PRD with UI/UX documents, stack thought out according to the needs of every project, reading a lot about services, lots of docs... THIS is part of the fun. Being a project manager is fun. Coding and solving problems is fun too, but I feel like vibe coding is more efficient AND more fun when considered as your lead developper in your own virtual company in which you are the CEO, CTO and N+1 of all your agents.",

When I’m lazy about the thinking, the code feels like chaos, no matter how good the model is.\n\nFor my little New Year project I kind of split it in two steps:  \nfirst I do exactly what you describe (write the doc, think through flows), then I let AI help with the heavy lifting and wire it into something like UI Bakery for the internal UI. It still feels like vibe coding, but with that project manager brain turned on before I start.\n\nTotally agree that the fun is in owning the whole thing, not just watching a bot spit out files.",

At least in my experience, working with v0 (by Vercel), I found that starting simple can bite me later on, when I need more sophistication. Somehow, it would lock into an architecture, then it later struggles to modify to meet more complex needs. After getting frustrated in my attempts to evolve the app, I started from scratch and outlined some key considerations about types of things I need it to do down the road. This helped v0 lay out a more robust architecture. I still approached it iteratively, but got to my result with fewer iterations, and more importantly, fewer frustrations!",

After the first UI Mock with replit I moved to Codex, Antigravity and Copilot, but that didn't matter much. Key was that in every iteration I demanded an extensive plan and tests for everything implemented. No feature was \"finished\" without 80% test coverage, no warnings of compiler or linter. I integrated that early on, going forward in small iterations feature by feature and that prevented most breaks. I saw the AI run into cycles of \"Now it is finished.\" \"Oh the tests break. let me see...\"\"Now it's finished...\" And so on - in one iteration alone... Without tests it would have broken everything in every feature, multiple times. This way I had only 5-10 minor issues like a button that didn't work or had no visual feedback.\n\nSo my take is: Build something you really are your own customer in, work in small, cleary defined iterations and tests, tests, tests...",

(FAccT 2024) and still aligned with newer 2025 comparisons.\n\n**Video:** High by design (e.g., \\~**225 Wh per 10 seconds**)  \nRecent 2025 text-to-video benchmarks (Luccioni / Hugging Face) show short video generations around **\\~90 Wh**, with large variance depending on resolution, frames, and diffusion steps. We intentionally stay conservative because video energy use explodes quickly with quality.\n\nNOTE: We're revising to \\~10 Wh per second in the next update based on latest credible data.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nWe continuously scan 2025 research and frontier disclosures, adjust when consensus shifts, and communicate results as **ranges for impact awareness—not billing-grade precision.** As better telemetry becomes public, the model will keep improving.\n\nOn water: we didn’t include it because it’s **far messier and less standardized than energy** right now. Water use varies hugely by data-center location, cooling method, climate, and local power mix, and providers don’t report water at a per-model or per-query level. That makes estimates easy to misinterpret or overstate, even though water use is real and important. Energy is currently the **most measurable and comparable signal**, so we focused there first — but expanding “footprint” to include water (and other resources) is absolutely something we want to do as the data improves.",

No auth required.\n\nHis response: \"But I have authentication set up?\"\n\nHere's what he didn't understand: **Supabase authentication and Supabase authorization are two different things.**\n\nAuthentication = proving who you are (login) Authorization = what you're allowed to access (RLS)\n\nBy default, Supabase exposes all tables via the API. Your `anon_key` is public - it's in your frontend code. Anyone can use it to query your database directly.\n\nThe ONLY thing stopping them is Row Level Security (RLS). And if you didn't enable it, your database is a public API.\n\n**This isn't theoretical.** In May 2025, security researchers scanned 1,645 apps built with Lovable. 170+ had completely exposed databases. They found home addresses, financial data, API keys, and payment records. One breach affected 13,000 users.\n\n**How to check if you're exposed (30 seconds):**\n\n1. Open your Supabase dashboard\n2. Go to Authentication → Policies\n3. If you see \"RLS disabled\" on any table with user data — you're exposed\n\n**How to fix it:**\n\n    -- Enable RLS on your table\n    ALTER TABLE public.your_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;\n    \n    -- Users can only see their own data\n    CREATE POLICY \"Users see own data\" \n    ON your_table\n    FOR SELECT \n    TO authenticated\n    USING (auth.uid() = user_id);\n\n**The key concepts:**\n\n* `anon_key` = public, meant for unauthenticated users, RESPECTS RLS\n* `service_role` key = bypasses ALL RLS, should NEVER be in frontend code\n* RLS disabled = your table is public to anyone with the anon key\n\n**Common mistakes I see:**\n\n1. **RLS enabled but no policies** \\- This blocks EVERYONE including your own app\n2. **Using service\\_role key in frontend** \\- Bypasses all security, anyone can extract it\n3. **Policies on SELECT but not INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE** \\- Users can't read others' data but can modify it\n4. **Forgetting the** `TO authenticated` **clause** \\- Policy applies to anon users too\n\n**Before you ship, run this:**\n\n    -- Find all tables without RLS\n    SELECT tablename \n    FROM pg_tables \n    WHERE schemaname = 'public' \n    AND tablename NOT IN (\n      SELECT tablename FROM pg_policies\n    );\n\n**Supabase also has a built-in Security Advisor in the dashboard. Run it. It catches most common issues.**\n\nI've seen way too many indie hackers ship apps with exposed databases because the AI tools they used didn't enable RLS by default. Takes 5 minutes to fix, saves you from being the next breach headline.",
