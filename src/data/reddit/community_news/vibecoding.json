Simply nailing down the product requirements, writing (or reviewing) a technical design doc, requiring the agent to add and run tests with each commit, and reviewing PRs will make the agents' output a lot more sensible. Use them as very diligent, somewhat competent, but very forgetful junior engineers and you will not be disappointed.\n\nAlternatively, after you have requirements, you can write a ton of tests against the API layer, use those tests to programmatically identify dead backend code and remove it, then break out one chunk of endpoints at a time and re-write them in new modules.  Then you can write a new frontend, starting with a proper API client and then going screen-by-screen - you may be able to parallelize this somewhat with another developer, but expect to uncover inconsistencies in the API as you go.\n\nBut that's how I've gone about refactoring a project that was shipped to users, where you have to take care not to break anything at every step.  If nothing has shipped yet, you have the freedom of starting over and can get there faster.",

Before touching anything, add basic integration tests for the main flows. Use the app as a black box and test the API endpoints. This is your safety net.\n\n  \n2. Start extracting one route group at a time into separate files. Pick the simplest one first. Keep the original file as the router that imports from the new modules.\n\n  \n3. Use Claude Code or similar to help with the mechanical refactoring. Paste chunks of the 30K file and ask it to identify logical groupings and extract them. The AI can handle tedious extraction work pretty well.\n\n  \nFor the frontend UI/UX mess:\n\n  \n1. Create a simple style guide first, even just 5-6 rules: primary color, font stack, button styles, spacing scale. Apply these globally via CSS variables.\n\n  \n2. Pick one component pattern (cards, forms, whatever is most common) and make it consistent everywhere. Then move to the next pattern.\n\n  \n3. Do NOT try to redesign everything at once.

Both are solid, but once you count lots of external users the numbers were not that different in the long run. In the end I stopped thinking in terms of “portal builder” and moved to a normal database plus an app builder on top.\n\nFor me that ended up being UIBakery on top of Postgres. I am not from their team or anything, it just fit better. External users only see their own rows, auth is handled once, and the pricing felt saner than paying per head for every customer who logs in twice a month. It took a bit more setup than Softr on day one, but I am much less stressed about the bill now.\n\nBig question is really your monthly budget and how technical you are willing to get. If you want to stay very low effort, Glide or Stacker might be easier. If you are ok touching a DB or getting some help, something like UI Bakery on top of Airtable or a proper DB can be a nice middle ground.",

Without that breathing room this turns into constant firefighting instead of real cleanup.\n\nThen I’d approach it in a structured, iterative way, in small steps:\n\n1. Stabilize the current state Make sure builds and runtime are reproducible and that it’s clear what currently works. Put very lightweight safeguards around the most important flows so you notice quickly if something breaks during refactoring.\n2. Make the structure visible Group the existing code into logically related functional areas and get a rough understanding of how they interact. At this stage it’s about creating clarity, not changing behavior.\n3. Modularize before optimizing Gradually move toward smaller, more clearly bounded modules without altering functionality. The goal here is readability and maneuverability, not “clean code” yet.\n4. Incremental simplification Once the structure holds, start reducing duplication, clarifying responsibilities, and making boundaries more explicit. It’s normal to go through multiple passes before things feel right.\n5. Bring UI/UX into a consistent shape No big redesign. Define a small set of layout and styling rules and apply them consistently over time. Consistency matters more than perfection here.\n\nAI can help a lot with the mechanical parts (splitting code, restructuring, repetitive changes), but it can’t make the judgment calls around boundaries, priorities, and acceptance criteria for you.\n\nThis only works if time is intentionally allocated for it. You’re being paid to do this and you’ll learn a lot about refactoring and system understanding, but without clear expectations and space, it quickly becomes your personal problem instead of a structural one.",

One UX, one front-end, one senior developer, one tester, one reality checker and a project manager.\n\nSet your AI to have the project manager persona orchestrate the personas and create a development plan with regular demos and testing by you and put it into an MD file that they can reference. Then get cracking. It should take a couple of hours tops.\n\nThis is how I have worked with similar apps developed and abandoned by human developers. Code was bloated and full of dependencies and broken functionality due to years of neglect and oversight. (Node 8, we pack, react/angular mix).\n\nKeep the vanilla JS and CSS. It is easier to check for errors and bugfix than any libraries or frameworks. Frameworks like SASS and react were made to make humans work quicker, not AI.

The system was built without anyone ever deciding what was in charge, what was allowed to change, and what absolutely shouldn’t. Once features start shipping faster than understanding, entropy wins every time.\n\nOn the UI/UX specifically, the trap is trying to “fix” it globally. If you touch everything at once, you’ll never finish. The only sane move is to pick one thin vertical slice that actually matters to users, define what “correct” looks like there, and enforce consistency only inside that boundary. Treat everything else as radioactive until proven otherwise.\n\nMore broadly, don’t try to refactor this into a good system straight away. First goal is to make it legible. Break the giant API file only if you can explain why each new boundary exists. If you can’t explain it, Cursor won’t be able to maintain it either.\n\nYou’re basically inheriting a product that worked by momentum, not structure. The fastest way out isn’t cleaning up the slop, it’s stopping the bleeding and forcing a single source of truth back into the system.\n\nIt’s rough work, but you’re asking the right question.",

Terminals are fun until you are tired. I threw together a little internal dashboard in UI Bakery that just hits my script’s endpoints, so I can click presets instead of retyping prompts and flags every time.\n\nCurious how you are using it day to day.

      "text": "I'm a professional software engineer with decades of experience who has really been enjoying vibe coding lately.  I'm not looking to discourage anyone or gatekeep here, I am truly thrilled by AI's ability to empower more software development. \n\nThat said, if you're a pure vibe coder (you don't read/understand the code you're generating) your codebase is over 100k lines, and you're either charging money or creating something people will depend on then PLEASE either do way more testing than you think you need to and/or try to find someone to do a code review (and yes, by all means, please ask the AI to minimize/optimize the codebase, to generate test plans, to automate as much testing as possible, and to review your code.  I STILL recommend doing more testing than the AI says and/or finding a person to look at the code).\n\nI'm nearly certain, more than 90% of the software people are vibe coding does not need > 100k lines of code and am more confident in saying that your users will never come close to using that much of the product.     \n  \nSome stats:\n\nA very quick research prompt estimates between 15-50 defects per 1000 lines of human written code.  Right now the AI estimate is 1.7x higher.  So 25.5 - 85 bugs per 1000 lines.  Averaging that out (and chopping the decimal off) we get 55 bugs per 1000 lines of code.  So your 100k code base, on average, has 5500 bugs in it.  Are you finding nearly that many?\n\nThe number of ways your features can interact increases exponentially.  It's defined by the formula 2\\^n - 1 - n.  So if your app has 5 features there are 26 possible interactions. 6 features 57, 7 features 120, 8 features 247 and so on.  Obviously the amount of significant interactions is much lower (and the probability of interactions breaking something is not nearly that high) but if you're not explicitly defining how the features can interact (and even if you are defining it with instructions we've all had the AI ignore us before) the AI is guessing.  Today's models are very good at guessing and getting better but AI is still probabalistic and the more possibilities you have the greater the chances of a significant miss.\n\nTo try to get in front of something, yes, software written by the world's best programmers has plenty of bugs and I would (and do) call for more testing and more careful reviews across the board.  However, the fact that expert drivers still get into car accidents doesn't mean newer drivers shouldn't use extra caution.\n\nBottom line, I'm really excited to see the barrier to entry disappearing and love what people are now able to make but I also care about the quality of software out there and am advocating that the care you put in to your work matches the scope of what you're building.",

So many super granular tests for things like \"is this function returning what's expected on a specific input\" and some test that will run over a whole feature like \"does this button does what it's supposed to be doing\".\n\nTo have truly solid software, you should spend almost as much time writing tests than building features and methodologies like test driven development go as far as writing the tests before the first line of feature code.\n\nFor vibe coding specifically, I'd suggest introducing this in your prompts. Maybe get Claude to give you test case before you start on the feature, that way you would have good indicator that it's working for the ai. Also, as your automated test base grow, you will catch way more regression since tests will stop passing on unrelated part of the software when you bump into a weird interaction.",

So clearly a human is not deterministic in the respect you can depend on them to nail the search for bugs in a reliable way.

              "text": "There's been plenty of cases with experienced professional devs fully embracing AI where bugs are slipping in, even with all the automated AI review they've setup and vulnerability scanning.\n\nOne recent example is a dev that's pushed 40k commits in less than a year on github with multiple AI agents collaborating on various projects. One of these was a community hub for a tool that users could share extensions on.\n\nThe vulnerability found was that you could upload an SVG as an icon for your extension that would show when browsing a list or on its own page. The SVG wasn't post processed to strip executable code however so it could run JS when loaded in your browser.\n\nDespite the dev having many years of experience at big corporations and a reputation full of praise, this vulnerability allowed a common XSS vulnerability. The assets like this SVG weren't served from a separate origin, there was no protection in place to prevent the SVG from stealing authentication cookies, and localStorage API was used to store JWT including a refresh token.\n\nSo a malicious SVG would infect all logged in users on that site, which would update any of their own authored extensions to infect, and so forth. Not only that these extensions would be used to run AI automation on systems. So all users of the extension would get an update and grant the attacker full access to the environment the AI agent ran in, which meant even more secrets and exploits to access.\n\nThat same dev also has another project for devs that has a desktop widget to show github stats and other features. To do this it should only need a token granting read-only access, but instead it's full write permissions. If compromised all users github accounts are at risk.\n\nEven if you are careful with your own AI usage, you may begin to use new libraries that are fully developed by AI where similar mistakes are made. These dependencies could be far down in the supply chain and thus really difficult for you to audit or even be aware of until it's too late.\n\nThe risk of these problems is far greater due to AI usage spreading and the highly likely scenario of the users to not be as cautious or knowledgeable as someone working at a slower pace with full understanding of these topics (who can still make mistakes, sure). That concern really compounds how cautious we must be.",

The number of features that actually interact is almost always much lower and features interacting aren't always dangerous.\n\nTo use a (not meant to be perfect) example, if we're looking at a video game, the main menu feature can interact with the load game feature, the game credits feature, the game options feature and the quit game feature.  There are cases where they could all, interact with each other but the credits feature probably doesn't need to interact with the game options or quit game but if they do (ex: there's an option to turn off showing credits at the end or the end credits after game completion will bring up the quit game feature when they're done displaying) it's unlikely to cause big problems if either the option or the end of credits quit interaction doesn't work.",

Interfacing with software such as Unity where there is a switch it would rather write its own routine to address a situation, and when it goes wrong add even more bad code. \nI guess a third thing is one that just happened to me. Its code expected a situation to occur in order for camera movement to occur. This is both of the two issues above. It was insane. I told it to simply do nothing in the situation. It came back with different code. I told it to stop and simply do nothing. It came back suggesting even more code. Aga, I told it to stop everything I don’t want more code for a situation that it would fix the issue. It finally did what I told it. Of course, what it thought was the problem wasn’t but simply bad code that it had written that wasn’t needed and messed everything up in the system. \nWhile the results may look good it doesn’t mean the good is.",

          "text": "Totally with you on the “LOC as golf score” thing, with the big caveat that readability wins and “less” only matters if you’re not smearing complexity across 40 folders. Where Warp has helped me in practice is making “being careful” feel like part of the workflow instead of a lecture you ignore at 2am. I’ll start a change with \\`/plan\\` so the agent has to commit to a concrete approach before it touches the repo, and the plan stays versioned so you can actually compare what you asked for vs what it did later.  Then when it spits out a diff, Interactive Code Review is genuinely useful because you can leave inline comments like a normal PR review and have the agent address them in one pass, which is a nice guardrail against “it works on my machine” vibes.  The other underrated safety net is Full Terminal Use, since a lot of real breakage only shows up when you run interactive flows, REPLs, debuggers, “top”, DB shells, etc, and Warp’s agent can actually drive those while you watch and take over when it’s about to do something dumb. If you’re dealing with a big vibed codebase, the “don’t lose the spec” problem is half the battle, so having a shared place to store plans, test checklists, runbooks, and workflows that sync for the team is clutch; Warp Drive is basically that lightweight shared brain, and you can keep it organized and up to date without it turning into yet another dead Confluence.  And if you want to push the review/testing discipline further, the Slack or Linear integrations are surprisingly good for “hey, go reproduce this bug and open a PR” without context-dropping, because the agent runs in a defined remote environment and reports back in the same thread with what it did.  That “environment” piece matters when you’re trying to avoid phantom green tests, since it’s an explicit Docker image + repo set + setup commands, not “whatever happened to be on my laptop today”.",

Basically share anything other than tools made for other makers).\n\nThere are a lot of niches that haven't seen the potential of vibe coding - only if we moved away from tools for other makers.\n\nThere are so many cool niches out there like gardening, blogging, visualization, data, art, chronic pain, sleep, games, personal finance, books, movies, decor, coffee, history, weddings, yoga, pets, wine, bread, maps, geocoding, bookbinding, events, music, sports, kayaking, coding etc.\n\nAnd I do think most vibe coders don't iterate and prompt *enough* to make their apps look non-vibe coded or at least touched by a human.\n\nVibe coded apps *can* look like they've been designed by humans.

His condition is progressing so I made it ready to go for a single switch when his body starts to lose both inputs. I'm going to develop a \"parking spot\" for the scanner to start/stop auto scan which will be on this app too, eventually.\n\nScreen readers would need to be disabled or you can simply turn off the TTS. Honestly, it's built specifically for Ben and it's supposed to represent what's possible now with no programming experience.\n\nThe whole thing could use a single button for everything today with variable scan speeds and all sorts of settings for visibility and TTS. I made every game work with a single input. \n\n(Touch, mouse, possibly eye tracking and head tracking work too provided it's enabled on the system)",

We’ve turned full automation where the company I got hired for had 10+ years work of knowledgebase solutions for tickets well written, and a fuck ton of emails with the full solutions and steps done etc. I’ve indexed all of those documents and goldmine of natural good info into a rag, and then hooked up ssh and sqlplus tools. Now whenever we receive an email from a client our model gets triggered, reads email, if it can find a solution or has a 10/10 confidence meter on being able to execute or run the solution to the clients problem, it will. If at anytime that confidence rating drops to 8/10, the model investigates on the appropriate server/db, and PREPARES everything for us to investigate and handle manually, such as placing the patch files in the right directories and unzipping and then telling us the commands we can just directly copy and paste, etc etc etc. This assistant gets activated via Slack and also iMessage, so being able to have an extremely powerful assistant like this has allowed us to gain more new clients than ever, with less work done by humans than ever. You just kinda really need to have a real necessity that is not too indepth with reasoning and thinking and learning on the fly, and instead jobs that anyone with the simple knowledge are able to execute if proper instructions are provided - those kind of tasks are the ones you need to start looking into trying to automate, the kinds that you say “i could do this if i just had the time” kinda things.",

The \"Where to Live\", Cultural Guide and Helpful Links are nice additions. Overall it works well, does what it promised extremely well and feels like a genuinely useful tool. I would 100% recommend this to someone looking to relocate.\n\nIf you were to ask me how to improve it, I'd suggest trimming down the amount of info. It can get a bit overwhelming and there is a significant amount of duplicated info (I see the same budget breakdown twice in the Overview tab and then once again in the Budget tab). It's nice that it's thorough but I think there's a balance point in which the amount of info is just right, and I think this crosses that line slightly towards the \"too much\" side. \n\nNice job overall!",

They didn’t rebuild it — they untangled the AI-generated mess, fixed the broken logic, completed missing flows, and got it to a real, shippable state. It’s live now and honestly looks way less “vibe-coded” than before.\n\nBig agree with your point though: vibe coding *can* look human, but only if you iterate hard and know when to stop prompting and let humans clean it up.

Really dig into the niche persona.  \n\n   Skip the basic stats.  \n\n   What's their style vibe?  \n\n   What mood do they want the app to hit?  \n\n   (Like gardening: chill, grounded, how-to vibes; coffee brewing: sharp, classy, hearty.)  \n\n   And their go-to visuals already (mags, sites, real-world stuff)?\n\n2.  Break down the aesthetic.  \n\n   Grab 3-5 non-app examples that nail the feel (book jacket, product packaging, room setup).  \n\n   Pick apart the visuals: colors, fonts, icons, spacing, even texture ideas.\n\n3.  Prompt with real detail and feeling.  \n\n   No more \"make it look nice.\"  \n\n   Go for: Build a landing page for a craft coffee bean tracker.  \n\n   Make it feel like a snug Pacific Northwest coffee shop, warm wood colors, simple icons from pour-over gear, font like an old-school coffee sack.\n\n4.  Iterate on small pieces first.  \n\n   Don't tackle the full app.  \n\n   Nail one bit at a time, a hero image, card design, button look.  \n\n   Perfect that, then grow it out.\n\nThis way, even vibe-coded stuff lands like it was made just for them, not some cookie-cutter.  \n\nIt's turning a gut feeling into a solid prompt.\n\nWhat's the first niche you're gonna try this on?",

Vibe coding makes it tempting to do huge refactors but that is where things fall apart. Small incremental changes are way easier to debug when something breaks.\n\n  \n3. Use git branches for experiments. Let Claude try wild ideas on a branch, test it, then merge or toss it.\n\n  \n4. For debugging, feeding Claude the error plus relevant context works better than just pasting the stack trace. Give it the function, the test that failed, and what you expected.\n\n  \nThe real insight: maintainability with AI coding is less about the code quality and more about YOUR understanding of the architecture. If you know how the pieces fit, you can always fix things. If you let the AI go wild without understanding what it built, you're toast.\n\n  \nSpeed vs maintainability? I optimize for understanding. Slower upfront but way faster at month 6.",

He is a experienced developer so he actually looked at the code and was like \"yeah we gotta clean up here and create some structure\" because if we don't we will have to redo everything down the line. Then again we are building quite a complex product (dreamforge.ai). I would say that if the product is more simple then def. it's possible to maintain and go on for a lot longer than 6 months.\n\nRegarding speed and maintainability for us we need to maintain it so that we can have speed. If there are new LLM models coming out we need to be super fast to implement them so I would say the go hand in hand.",

The architecture is important, Starting on [Lovable.dev](http://Lovable.dev) meant inheriting a React + TypeScript frontend built with Vite, which is primarily client-side rendered. That setup is not ideal for SEO, so I had to introduce server-side rendering selectively to compensate. If I just started with a Next.js app, that already has SSR which is better for SEO. I don't have any issues maintaining it, I've had to rebuild some sections like all the RSS parsing and categorization, agent editorial management but with new models and services, you're going to be rebuilding things regularly.

I built [hotfix.cloud](http://hotfix.cloud) because I kept ending up in that exact moment where prod breaks and you just want a clean proposed fix instead of spelunking through AI generated files at 2am.\n\nIf you want a second comment to reply to OP directly when they ask about speed vs maintainability, do this:\n\nSpeed matters more early, but only if you can recover fast. Maintainability is just recovery time at month 6. If you cannot quickly identify what broke and ship a safe fix, you are going to rebuild anyway.",

Everyone talks about how easy it is now with Claude Code, Antigravity etc.., but they leave out the part where you get completely fucked by production issues that AI can't solve.\n\nPure AI coding gets you maybe 60% there. You can build nice landing pages, set up login systems, even get a decent dashboard running. But then real subscribers start using your product and everything breaks in ways the AI never warned you about.\n\nLemonsqueezy integration that worked perfectly in test mode but randomly failed with real customers. I thought I was making money while actual payments were bouncing. AI couldn't explain webhook validation or why certain cards were getting declined without proper error handling.\n\nDatabase performance that was fine with 10 users but completely shit with 1,000+. Every query started timing out. AI kept suggesting caching fixes instead of telling me I was running garbage queries on unindexed tables. My dashboard was loading every single data point instead of paginating like a normal human would.\n\nUser sessions that just randomly logged people out. What happens when someone's subscription expires while they're using the app? How do you handle multiple browser tabs? AI could fix individual bugs but had no clue how to build proper session management.\n\nData isolation problems where customers could see each other's data. That's a fun support ticket to get. AI had zero understanding of how to debug multi-tenant architecture or why my database setup was fundamentally broken.\n\nBilling logic that looked perfect but created accounting chaos. Proration, failed payment retries, subscription changes - the AI code \"worked\" but had edge cases that destroyed my revenue tracking. One customer downgrading somehow triggered three billing events and I couldn't figure out what the hell happened.\n\nThe turning point was realizing I needed to be a better AI supervisor, not just blindly trust whatever code it spat out. Started setting up actual logging for critical actions, testing payment flows with real cards before launching, keeping a simple spreadsheet of what actually worked vs what looked good in dev.\n\nSpent a few weeks learning database basics, payment processing fundamentals, how web apps actually handle user data and security. Not trying to become a senior dev, just enough to read server logs and understand when something was genuinely broken vs a quick fix.\n\nMost success stories skip the part where they got stuck for weeks on subscription billing or had to hire actual developers to rebuild their payment system. The sweet spot is learning just enough SaaS fundamentals to not get completely destroyed by production, then using AI to move 10x faster on the stuff you actually understand.\n\nStill using AI for 90% of my development, but now I can tell when it's giving me code that'll explode in production vs code that'll actually work with real users and real money.",

If you have more than one request in flight to refresh a token, you'll sign users out invisibly and most likely churn them if you're not catching the error and re-signing then back in. This is a subtle auth thing that flies under the radar. Lock on user row when refreshing token - don't blindly refresh. To servers this looks like lost creds and multiple big OAuth providers require re-auth.\n\n\nE: if it's not clear, imagine the auth server getting a refresh tokens request, refreshing the token, and then getting another request for the old, now revoked token. Looks sus. Always think about concurrency in everything you do :)",

They are not easy buttons. If you expect quality output, unfortunately you have to do some work to give them quality input. I wish this is what people understood just in general, and I wish that was part of the marketing more instead of the breathless, contextless hyperbole.\n\nCool shit can definitely be made with this stuff by non-developers. But we still have to make an effort to learn the tool and take the time to set it and thus ourselves up for success. It’s The old saying: Garbage in, garbage out. Nowhere is this more true than with AI tools.",

People call it vibecoding but I think that word is fucking stupid. \n\nAnyways, for brief context: I’m building a mini-webapp (it’s called Picturific) that automatically generates multiple images with zero prompts, while keeping character and style continuity. \n\nThis is how it went down.\n\nI went to Austin for a music show (the band’s name is Orchid, if anyone cares) for 3 days. I did not take my laptop and I did not check emails. I only checked emails when arrived, and I started seeing receipts from FAL. At first I saw 2, which I thought and knew was a lot. But I did not think much of it. I continued working. Then I came back to check the emails again. I scrolled more. And a shitload of these FAL emails started appearing.\n\nIn less than 72 hours, my project had burned through $700+. Fuck.\n\nI had no idea how this happened.\n\nI spent the next 6 hours pissed, digging through logs, with the help of the same AI that had messed up the code. But I had no choice, I don’t know how to code. I had to work with the AI knowing it was capable of fucking up again. \n\nIt turns out I (or rather the AI) had built what the AI called a \"Ghost Machine.\" If you're building with AI agents and cloud functions, you might want to read this.\n\nOne of the core values of my app Picturific is consistency. To keep our characters looking the same across x scenes, I built an \"AI Auditor\" (The AI called it the Eye of Sauron). After every image is generated, the auditor checks it against a character reference sheet. If the hair is slightly wrong or a character is missing a medal (for example), it rejects the image and triggers a retry.\n\nThe Hallucination Cascade\n\nI asked the AI to plan the scenes based on a long story. I asked for 3 images. But the AI got \"excited\" or something and returned a plan for 22 scenes instead. Since I didn't have a hard cap on the logic yet, my code started 22 separate tasks.\n\nThe \"Zombie Worker\" Loop. \n\nThis was the real fuck up. Some of these complex generations were taking 2 minutes. My cloud provider (Supabase) has a \"self-healing\" feature. If a task takes too long, the cloud thinks it crashed and automatically restarts it.\n\nBecause I hadn't built \"Checkpointing\" (the code didn't check if it was already on its 3rd attempt after a restart), the newly born worker would start the cycle all over again.\n\nThe result of this was that one single user click triggered an infinite loop of AI agents fighting each other over shit like \"incorrect hair shading,\" with the cloud platform constantly reviving the dead processes to keep the war going. At $0.15 a generation, the bill moved fast.\n\nThe Three (very fucking expensive) Lessons (that hopefully will save you some trouble):\n\n1. AI doesn’t understand your budget. You can't trust an LLM to follow a \"Number of Images\" constraint if the input text is long. It can hallucinate scope. You must hard-code limits into your backend. If you don't have a \"Circuit Breaker\" in your code, you’re just handing your credit card to a toddler who likes to click buttons.\n2. The Cloud is a Multiplier. \"Self-healing\" cloud functions are great for uptime, but they are a nightmare for \"Leaky\" AI logic. If your code can trigger a restart without checking its own history, a small bug becomes a massive financial leak.\n3. Visibility is your only defense. If I hadn't been logging every single \"Audit Failure\" and \"Task Start\" in a forensic database, I would have had no way to explain the $700. I would have just seen a high bill and probably quit the project. Detailed logs are the only reason I was able to find exactly why what happened happened, and how to fix it without probably having to restart the whole thing (this is probablue due to me not being a developer and not being able to read code).\n\nFor now, I have plugged the leaks. I limited the AI scope, fixed the restart loops, and taught the \"Auditor\" that perfection isn't worth bankruptcy, or something like that.\n\nThe silver linings is that the \"forced\" retries actually worked—the consistency is better than ever because the AI eventually \"learned\" what I wanted.\n\nIt’s been an expensive lesson, but the output is finally something I’m proud of.\n\nWhat's your worst AI fuck-up story?",

Poor project planning, I say this because while you think you reviewed the project documents you didn't review them with a panel of experts. Some of this can be automated. \n\nUltimately, better source documents means better end product. Here is an example:\n\nYou tell AI to write an application and when it comes back it's missing 24 API endpoints and 35% of the database structure, UI/UX logic, etc. \n\nWhen you properly plan this process out the AI will build out everything and keep a map to everything as well. \n\nPersonally I went backwards in time on my practices with software development using AI. I actually stumbled into the idea that if you plan everything and I really do mean every detail you can get a working finished product using some of the most complex coding languages today. \n\nI do charge for assistance on project refactoring, etc. and I'm already pretty booked up. For the right price though my schedule just opened up.\n\nI primarily focus on Secure SaaS solutions and have built several sites which the longest project was quoted to taking 2 to 3 years by a team of 6 which I had it planned and coded in less than a month. I spent the next 2 months source reviewing and verifying the logic before sending it off to the client and they were very excited. :-)\n\nThis work was under a strict NDA so I can't show off the finished work sadly.  That site was a really cool idea and they even provided me patents they already had in a pending state and asked me to see if their ideas would work and if they didn't to find an alternative way. (Yes, AI can also do that as well.)\n\nI include a final code scan to validate if it detected any patent infringement. It's not perfect of course but one thing to remember; all main steam AI models contain patents as a source. AI is able to tell you if it used a patent during development.",

A few passes of that until the plan is solid with details on all the stages of implementation. \n\nThis gives me much better results than when I used to jump straight into directly asking an agent to go something with code.\n\nThen once it's done, I'll do a few agentic audit and optimisation passes, in some cases even refactors to ensure that the codebase is neat and tidy.\n\nWorks very well for me.",
