For reeder it’s 10 free feeds, so I guess for most paying users the reason is >10 feeds?\n\nWould be curious to know :)",

I can auto-file stuff into “must read,” “maybe,” and “junk,” then search years back like it’s my own mini Google. That’s where free tiers usually fall down: they let you subscribe, but not really manage volume. I also like integrations: piping key feeds into Notion and Slack, and using Reddit + Hacker News as high-signal sources. Feedly and Notion AI help summarize noisy feeds, and Pulse quietly catches niche Reddit mentions I care about so they don’t get buried. Bottom line: I pay when the reader becomes an actual workflow tool, not just a list of feeds.",

It doesn’t really think in feed limits, instead it groups hundreds of live feeds per country and shows everything strictly in chronological order, no algorithm. What I like is that you don’t have to manually add individual feeds, you basically subscribe to countries and everything flows from there. Even with a lot of sources the daily volume still feels managable. There are some AI related features too which I haven’t really explored yet, but the alerts / notifications works surprisingly well for me so far for simple news tracking. Not saying it’s for everyone, but if you want to reduce noise without hunting for feeds, it’s worth checking out.",
