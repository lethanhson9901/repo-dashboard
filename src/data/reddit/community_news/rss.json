For reeder it’s 10 free feeds, so I guess for most paying users the reason is >10 feeds?\n\nWould be curious to know :)",

It doesn’t really think in feed limits, instead it groups hundreds of live feeds per country and shows everything strictly in chronological order, no algorithm. What I like is that you don’t have to manually add individual feeds, you basically subscribe to countries and everything flows from there. Even with a lot of sources the daily volume still feels managable. There are some AI related features too which I haven’t really explored yet, but the alerts / notifications works surprisingly well for me so far for simple news tracking. Not saying it’s for everyone, but if you want to reduce noise without hunting for feeds, it’s worth checking out.",

It offers enought without feeling empty or cluttered. Unlike some of those other top apps, i didnt feel overwhelmed right at the start lol, one thing i am curious about is whether you plan to implement any ai features? e.g. the option to add your own ai api-key to generate summaries? I also have a technical question: i noticed that when i move the pap to the background and tehn repoen it shortly after, the app restarts completely. this was a bit annoying when i was trying to paste rss links (i discovered the built-in search function a bit too late hehe). was that behavior normal?\n\nOther than that, i am really impressed and excited to see what improvements are coming in the near future. Thank you for you work!",

I want it to work well for long-time RSS users, but also feel comfortable for people who are completely new to RSS.\n\nAbout AI features, there is a Features section in the menu where users can suggest ideas and vote on them. There are currently a few AI-related requests, and one of them is slowly getting more attention. I am not personally very interested in AI features, but if enough users want it, I am open to looking into it. If I do add something like summaries, it would most likely require users to provide their own API key, as you suggested.\n\nThe app restarting when coming back from the background is not intended behavior. Thank you for pointing it out. I will investigate this and make sure it is fixed in an upcoming release. Thanks again!\n\nAlso, could I ask you to leave a review in the store? It will help me a lot!\n\nFeel free to reach out anytime if you have questions or ideas.",

      "text": "I built it because most feed readers either feel abandoned, overloaded with features, or lock you into a hosted service. This one is meant to be simple: you subscribe to feeds, it fetches new posts in the background, and you get a daily digest by email. No infinite scrolling, no algorithm.\n\nYou can browse feeds on the web, vote on articles without creating an account, and share links easily. There’s also a small admin UI to manage feeds and subscribers. It can run as a normal Node app or self-hosted with Docker.\n\nRecently I added multiple UI themes (including a Catppuccin-style one) just for fun — same layout, different vibes — but the focus is still on being boring and reliable.\n\nLive demo: [https://feeder.works](https://feeder.works)  \nRepo: [https://github.com/runawaydevil/thefeeder](https://github.com/runawaydevil/thefeeder)\n\nIf you’re into self-hosted tools, RSS, or just tired of modern content platforms, feedback is welcome.

Accounts for 'users' that are able to 'log in' is quite important\n\n \\- how the links are removed? is it configurable?\n\n \\- voting on articles sounds quite fun, but what about tags? can link be tagged with #something?\n\nMy project by the way.
