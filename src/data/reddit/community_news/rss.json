      "text": "Built **UnSocial** because I hate social media and can't help myself not wasting time on it. I use Inoreader to keep up with everything, but social platforms refuse to provide RSS feeds. **UnSocial** acts as a local companion app to your favorite reader, adding the RSS functionality these platforms need.\n\n# Why use it?\n\n* **Private Feeds:** Since it uses your own login, it can generate feeds for **private profiles and closed groups** you follow.\n* **100% Local & Private:** No third-party servers or telemetry. Your credentials and data never leave your machine, Everything is processed locally on your hardware.\n* **Zero Footprint:** A single portable Windows `.exe` (MIT License). Runs in the system tray and auto refreshes in the background.\n* **RSS Reader Integration:** Includes optional Cloudflare Tunnel support so you can access your local feeds on your RSS reader of choice.\n\n# How it compares to [Insert another tool name here]\n\nWhile tools like RSS-Bridge are great, **UnSocial** fills a different niche:\n\n1. **No Docker/Server Required:** It’s a portable Windows app.\n2. **Authenticated Content:** It handles private/authenticated content natively through your local browser session.\n3. **I couldn't find a free one that works.**\n\n# LLM Disclaimer\n\nI’m not a professional dev, so I used LLMs to help bridge the coding gap. It’s stable for daily use, though the code might have some rough edges.\n\nFeel free to contribute to the repo, and if this app helps you in anyway, I’d appreciate you [buying me a coffee here](https://buymeacoffee.com/uiuu3nugyy).\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/pynbbz/UnSocial](https://github.com/pynbbz/UnSocial)",

However, if they publish 10 articles a day or whatever, I don't want ten separate emails in my inbox every day. I'd like them to be collected into a single daily (or maybe even weekly) digest email.\n\nIs there a webapp that offers this functionality for free or no more than about $1 per month? Or is there some way for me to do it from within Gmail or Thunderbird?\n\nThanks!",

With our current pricing credits are ⅒ of a USD cent each (or half-price if you buy in bulk). So if you had content from 50 different feeds every day of the month that would be up to 31¢ per month. But the price will be less if you have less feeds on any given day. You can see full pricing info here: https://feedmail.org/#pricing\n\nWe also offer a free trial of 400 credits. So depending on your usage you can probably get many months of daily digests before you have to top up your account the first time.\n\nWe don't offer a free option because I don't think it properly aligns our incentives with our customers. But I try to keep our pricing very affordable.",
