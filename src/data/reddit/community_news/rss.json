But you miss because of lousy twitter algo. You can go their newsletter -> convert it into rss (just open the source code and there will be some rss link)\n\nAnd all major web dev sites like nextjs, vercel, provide their own blog -> you can find their rss  links inot the source code.\n\nAnd I think there are some paid services which also let you convert someone's twitter into rss.\n\nSummary: if you read something again and again on twitter, youtube, reddit, other platform, just use rss reader. Algo changes every day, and you end up missing your favourite creater.\n\nBy the way, i am the founder of https://vimrss.com/. It is minimalist and it supports Vim Keybindings (basically u dont have to use the mouse to read it).",

I mean, RSS was made for a different internet, where there was no \"discovery.\" You friend would email you a link to a cool website, and if you liked that blog post or whatever, you could subscribe with RSS.\n\nThen RSS fell out of popularity and I imagine it just doesn't have a critical mass of users to agree on \"this is how and where you can find RSS feeds.\" There are aggregators like the ones people have shared here (which I'm sure are great!), but it's just not centralized, for better and for worse.\n\nThe way I view it, finding good feeds to follow is part of the RSS and de-algorithm-ing experience. For example, I follow my friends' Letterboxd and Substacks with RSS to keep up on those things. I found a few blogs (some personal, some for small companies) to follow.\n\nBasically, I think you should try to figure out what you want out of your RSS reader. Is it a news feed? Is it a de-algorithm'd social media? Is it content consumption? Is it following blogs and feeds that post thoughtful content? There's no right answer, you need to figure out what you're looking for.",

      "text": "\nHey folks, I want to introduce my project, that I am now calling out for beta testers. [Foragd](https://foragd.app) is an online, web-based feed reader. It keeps your subscriptions in sync and works on all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) and all browsers.\n\n## What Makes Foragd Different?\n\n- **Focused on reading content, not tracking totals:** not trying to shoehorn feeds into an email-like interface and not showing unread counts. Straightforward homepage, subscription, and article views.\n- **Powerful Search:** fast and powerful searching. Find that article mentioning that thing from that site a while back, easily.\n- **Easy Filtering:** easily filter articles within a subscription by keyword, phrase, category, or author. No complex filter building, just easy `+/-` operators. For example: `alcoholic drinks + -\"rum based\" +daiquiri`\n\n## Who Is a Good Beta Tester?\n\n- A love of the indie web and independent content.\n- You want to use a cloud-based RSS/Atom/Syndication reader and are willing to pay for a subscription.\n- You are willing to provide, at least fortnightly, feedback during the beta period.\n\n## What Do You Get out of It?\n\n- A year of the top-tier *Curator* plan for the service, free when it launches.\n- Help a solo developer launch their first product.\n\n## How Do I Sign Up?\n\nFill out the [sign up form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMnLy6zJToJ8yuQfr8TlsnTuC7Bt4x2OGhl9F_jP6IncGiCA/viewform?usp=dialog) and we will be in touch in a day or so with details!\n",

With article favorites, these are kept forever (beyond your plan retention) and definitely looking at how they can be exported.\n\nWhat service and plan level are you currently using?

For iOS, I use [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/), but I rarely use iOS, so others will probably have better recommendations.  Limiting yourself to lesser products that work cross-platform, like aggregator-specific apps, usually means a product with less features and plenty of ads.

I couldn't find any Newsboat-like newsreader that syncs across devices. So I built a web version of it.\n\nI love YouTube, but I really don't like the recommendation system of YouTube.\n\nI subscribe youtubers. But YouTube doesn't recommend any of them.\n\nThen, I keep missing the newsletters like \"thisweekinreact.com\". My email is flooded with lots of useless emails.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n\\- You only need h,j,k,l to navigate the user interface.\n\n\\- There are other vim keys like g, and G. These are shown when you press \\`?\\`.\n\n\\- I tried to mimic newsboat as much as I could. But I also wanted to \"rice\" it (make it little bit good looking).\n\n\\- I am also using arrow keys to navigate.\n\n\\- And each feed source provides something like 15 posts at a time. So, I also added the refresh button (r key) to refresh all the feeds. Now, if the next day, for example, 2 feeds are added, you will have total 17 feeds. The old 2 will not be lost becasue they are saved in the database.\n\n\\- And sometimes, my mind gets so cluttered that I like the basic mouse. Even my arch linux with tiling window manager supports basic mouse keybindings.\n\n\\- And most importantly, I want to read https://www.reddit.com/r/vim, specific reddit user like https://www.reddit.com/user/ponzi\\_gg.rss, youtube channels like https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia, my archlinux news before updating it https://www.archlinux.org/feeds/news/ (it breaks sometimes).\n\n\\---\n\nAnd If you try it, please give me some feedbacks. Any thing weird or something not working.\n\nAnd please forgive me for any weird English mistakes sicen that is not my native language.  \n",

And on the internet, most of other rss readers have too many features i don't want. newsboat is what i liked the most in the past.   \nAnd at the same time, newsboat was too difficult to configure, so here i put these configuration behind the scripts. In rss, you can load youtube, reddit and other platform, but that requires some knowledge and hunting about how to find their rss links. So, added those into backend scripts. So it supports youtube/@... youtube/c/channelname, youtube/user/... So, i tried my best to make it fast, simple for me. and i thought making it open to others. and also tried to put it as low price as possible ( one time tiny payment to maintain database cost; it also motivates me to invest some time)\n\nthanks again, to give your time",

      "text": "Hi RSS'ers!\n\n**TL;DR**: I see a lot of RSS readers on here emphasize how they have \"no algorithms.\" My question is: what's so bad about algorithms, in your opinion? Would any of you be interested in alpha-testing an ad-free, 100% private/on-device algorithmic RSS reader? If so, reach out to [hello@kitpicks.com](mailto:hello@kitpicks.com) \n\n**Some more questions** to maybe prompt some thoughts:\n\nIs the main problem with algorithmic feeds that they're not 100% predictable? Is it that they optimize for scrolling/time-in-app/time-spent-looking-at-ads as opposed to quality clicks? (Or do they somehow otherwise optimize for \"the wrong thing\"?) Is it that most algorithms involve some centralized data collection of your reading behavior? Something else?\n\nIf you're maybe open to an algorithmic feed, do you use an algorithmic RSS reader? Why or why not?\n\n  \n**My background**:\n\nI'm an ex-FAANG software engineer currently in a Computer Science Master's program. I've always been interested in kind of the decentralization/SOLID/IndieWeb movements around web content -- I think there are some seriously misaligned incentives between centralized ad-supported feeds (Insta/FB, Twitter, perhaps even Reddit...) and user interests. That said, I think there is \\*something\\* to be said for the \"filtering service\" that algorithms provide. For me, Twitter and Google Discover are go-to sources for reading material, just because they surface content from potentially hundreds of different sources, and chronological RSS feeds often feel like I'm slogging through too much content.\n\nSo, in my spare time, I've started developing an RSS reader which will do privacy-first on-device algorithmic ranking based on your clicks and explicit thumbs up/thumbs down of content you were recommended. It's not quite ready to be shared yet but I did want to get some feedback on the idea to gauge its potential.",

But some people wish to control over what they get and what they do not get.\n\nThe problems with most \"algorithmic\" approaches:\n\n- They are probabilistic => no guarantee that you will not lose important news, and no guarantee that you will not receive noise.\n- They are not under the control of the user; they are under the control of their provider (for example, Facebook feed is under the control of Meta, obviously). So, at the end, the corporation decided what you'll see and what you'll miss — not a very optimistic situation.",

For example:\n\n- Currently, I have 629 subscriptions.\n- 2900 news for the last 3 days.\n- Read only the 200 most relevant for me.\n\nMy reader places tags on each article with the help of LLMs, and the user can create rules like `elon-musk + tesla => -100 points`, `nasa + mars => +100 points`, so the user always sees the most relevant articles on the top.\n\n> algorithmic ranking based on your clicks and explicit thumbs up/thumbs down of content you were recommended.\n\nI have the same idea in mind, but instead of ranking news directly based on user preferences (I assume you are working on something like that), I plan to recommend new rules for the user (based on the same preferences). So, the ranking will continue be transparent, and users continue to be in control.\n\nIt may be a good idea for us to collaborate on this topic.

      "text": "Hey everyone! I've been building Corefeed, an iOS feed reader that unifies articles, podcasts, and YouTube channels in a single timeline.\n\nThe initial idea started because I wanted time-based grouping (last hour, today, this week, etc.) of entries rather than just endless chronological scrolling. I thought this would make it easier to stay on top of my feeds when I don't check in for a couple of days. I also wanted to experiment with Apple's Foundation Models, so I added optional AI-generated digests and briefings features.\n\nAs I progressed, the idea developed more into a mixing articles, podcasts, and YoutTube channels in a timeline. The app now supports RSS, Atom, JSON Feed, podcast feeds (both traditional and Podcasting 2.0 spec), plus YouTube channels (excluding shorts). It now has a nice minimal-but-enough podcast player, automatic tags generated for each article (for filters) with Apple Intelligence (when available), feed groups, and various quality-of-life improvements. One thing that I'm currently working on is the idea of having multiple timelines that can be switched between easily. Each timeline would be a set of frozen filters basically.\n\nI've been working on it for a couple of months but it's still in early alpha and needs more testing and refinement before I'd consider submitting to the App Store.\n\nMore details and screenshots/videos on: https://corefeed.app\n\nIf anyone is interested in helping me test: https://tally.so/r/D4kdB5",
