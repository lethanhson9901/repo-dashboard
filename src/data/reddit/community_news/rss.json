And use it into the RSS Reader.\n\nFor reddit, just add .rss to any reddit group or user.\n\nAnd if you see someone on twitter is constantly posting good stuff. But you miss because of lousy twitter algo. You can go their newsletter -> convert it into rss (just open the source code and there will be some rss link)\n\nAnd all major web dev sites like nextjs, vercel, provide their own blog -> you can find their rss  links inot the source code.\n\nAnd I think there are some paid services which also let you convert someone's twitter into rss.\n\nSummary: if you read something again and again on twitter, youtube, reddit, other platform, just use rss reader. Algo changes every day, and you end up missing your favourite creater.\n\nBy the way, i am the founder of https://vimrss.com/. It is minimalist and it supports Vim Keybindings (basically u dont have to use the mouse to read it).",

I mean, RSS was made for a different internet, where there was no \"discovery.\" You friend would email you a link to a cool website, and if you liked that blog post or whatever, you could subscribe with RSS.\n\nThen RSS fell out of popularity and I imagine it just doesn't have a critical mass of users to agree on \"this is how and where you can find RSS feeds.\" There are aggregators like the ones people have shared here (which I'm sure are great!), but it's just not centralized, for better and for worse.\n\nThe way I view it, finding good feeds to follow is part of the RSS and de-algorithm-ing experience. For example, I follow my friends' Letterboxd and Substacks with RSS to keep up on those things. I found a few blogs (some personal, some for small companies) to follow.\n\nBasically, I think you should try to figure out what you want out of your RSS reader. Is it a news feed? Is it a de-algorithm'd social media? Is it content consumption? Is it following blogs and feeds that post thoughtful content? There's no right answer, you need to figure out what you're looking for.",

I couldn't find any Newsboat-like newsreader that syncs across devices. So I built a web version of it.\n\nI love YouTube, but I really don't like the recommendation system of YouTube.\n\nI subscribe youtubers. But YouTube doesn't recommend any of them.\n\nThen, I keep missing the newsletters like \"thisweekinreact.com\". My email is flooded with lots of useless emails.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n\\- You only need h,j,k,l to navigate the user interface.\n\n\\- There are other vim keys like g, and G. These are shown when you press \\`?\\`.\n\n\\- I tried to mimic newsboat as much as I could. But I also wanted to \"rice\" it (make it little bit good looking).\n\n\\- I am also using arrow keys to navigate.\n\n\\- And each feed source provides something like 15 posts at a time. So, I also added the refresh button (r key) to refresh all the feeds. Now, if the next day, for example, 2 feeds are added, you will have total 17 feeds. The old 2 will not be lost becasue they are saved in the database.\n\n\\- And sometimes, my mind gets so cluttered that I like the basic mouse. Even my arch linux with tiling window manager supports basic mouse keybindings.\n\n\\- And most importantly, I want to read https://www.reddit.com/r/vim, specific reddit user like https://www.reddit.com/user/ponzi\\_gg.rss, youtube channels like https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia, my archlinux news before updating it https://www.archlinux.org/feeds/news/ (it breaks sometimes).\n\n\\---\n\nAnd If you try it, please give me some feedbacks. Any thing weird or something not working.\n\nAnd please forgive me for any weird English mistakes sicen that is not my native language.  \n",

So, i couldnot just reading it from my other devices. And on the internet, most of other rss readers have too many features i don't want. newsboat is what i liked the most in the past.   \nAnd at the same time, newsboat was too difficult to configure, so here i put these configuration behind the scripts. In rss, you can load youtube, reddit and other platform, but that requires some knowledge and hunting about how to find their rss links. So, added those into backend scripts. So it supports youtube/@... youtube/c/channelname, youtube/user/... So, i tried my best to make it fast, simple for me. and i thought making it open to others. and also tried to put it as low price as possible ( one time tiny payment to maintain database cost; it also motivates me to invest some time)\n\nthanks again, to give your time",
