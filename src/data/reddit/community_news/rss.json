I was going to start with just adding NBC Top Stories, Al Jazeera Breaking News, Reuters Top Stories, The Guardian, The Seattle Times and probably more. However when I click Add Feed the only one that shows up is The Guardian so that one works. I've tried finding RSS urls for the others and pasting them in and nothing seems to work. What am I missing?\n\n  \nDownloaded v2.16.1 from Droid-ify",

However, if they publish 10 articles a day or whatever, I don't want ten separate emails in my inbox every day. I'd like them to be collected into a single daily (or maybe even weekly) digest email.\n\nIs there a webapp that offers this functionality for free or no more than about $1 per month? Or is there some way for me to do it from within Gmail or Thunderbird?\n\nThanks!",

With our current pricing credits are ⅒ of a USD cent each (or half-price if you buy in bulk). So if you had content from 50 different feeds every day of the month that would be up to 31¢ per month. But the price will be less if you have less feeds on any given day. You can see full pricing info here: https://feedmail.org/#pricing\n\nWe also offer a free trial of 400 credits. So depending on your usage you can probably get many months of daily digests before you have to top up your account the first time.\n\nWe don't offer a free option because I don't think it properly aligns our incentives with our customers. But I try to keep our pricing very affordable.",
