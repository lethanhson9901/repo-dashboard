But as it doesn't support mobile, I need a different app on my phone, and the saved articles are getting more out of sync over time.\n\nI hope a self-hosted reader can solve the problem. I'd expect the new reader to inherit at least some of the merits of Feedbro, such as:\n* Switchable reading layout (Feedbro provides 6, but now I mainly rely on the list mode)\n* Feed-specific auto refreshing\n* Rule-based tagging and highlighting (But not necessarily GPT-powered; I believe this is what most of readers lack)\n\nThere might be some other features that I depend on which I haven't realized.
