I can't code and anything I accomplish technologically only occurs through frantic googling.\n\nHaving a feed sounds great, but I can't get anything I actually want to work. I tried a few different clients that came with Linux Mint's app store, with Quiterss seeming most viable.\n\nExcept nothing works. I can't get any feeds to generate. Most of the news sources I wanted (AP, Ground News, Reuters) either don't offer feeds, or seem to require lots of workarounds. I've looked at RSS generator apps but maybe I'm just lazy, they seem so labor-intensive for something that I don't trust myself to make work.\n\nReddit consistently gives me an \"error transferring \\[URL\\]\" message. Am I supposed to link my account? (I saw an old thread about some countries banning this; I'm in the USA so I wouldn't think that would be an issue?)\n\nThat said, do all feeds require accounts? I've gotten \"authentication needed\" messages from several feeds. Everything seems to need verification or, if I'm reading right, an account on something like Feedly? I think I was under the impression that one simply inputs the right URL and it will create a feed and update, and it's doable locally/privately/offline?\n\nIf anyone can point me in the direction of a good guide or toolset to *actually get working feeds* I'd be much obliged.",

I'll work on adding options for that later, but for now I will update my application and it seems like you should be able to generate a basic feed from the API call that the site is using to populate these news items. If not with mkfd, maybe there's another tool out there to generate feeds from API calls.",
