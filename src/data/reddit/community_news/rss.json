So I built a browser extension to solve this.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Select any content on a webpage and the AI automatically generates RSSHub-compatible rules\n* No need to understand RSSHub's rule syntax or write any code\n* Export rules directly in the format RSSHub expects\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Install the extension\n2. Navigate to any website you want to create an RSS feed for\n3. Select the content elements (title, link, description, date, etc.)\n4. AI analyzes the page structure and generates the rule\n5. Export and use with your RSSHub instance\n\nIt's open source: [https://github.com/xiongsircool/rsshub-rule-generator](https://github.com/xiongsircool/rsshub-rule-generator)\n\nWould love feedback from the community.
