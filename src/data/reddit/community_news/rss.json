You subscribe to Laterfeed's atom feed via your favorite RSS aggregator (e.g. Miniflux, FreshRSS) or via your RSS client, and you get to view your saved-later articles as RSS posts.\n\nLet me know what you think and if this helped you!\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/orellazri/laterfeed](https://github.com/orellazri/laterfeed)",
