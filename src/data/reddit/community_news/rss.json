You subscribe to Laterfeed's atom feed via your favorite RSS aggregator (e.g. Miniflux, FreshRSS) or via your RSS client, and you get to view your saved-later articles as RSS posts.\n\nLet me know what you think and if this helped you!\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/orellazri/laterfeed](https://github.com/orellazri/laterfeed)",

On Substack, the writing can be great, but the discussion mostly lives in the comments under each individual newsletter. It doesn’t really feel like a shared space where conversations connect across topics or communities. On Reddit, there are some excellent niche subs, but threads can get buried fast, repeat the same points, or drift off-topic once they get big.\n\nAny recommendations? What platforms or communities have you found to have genuinely high-quality discussion?\n\nBonus: are there any platforms that use AI in a helpful way, like summarizing threads, reducing noise, or making it easier to follow meaningful conversations?",
