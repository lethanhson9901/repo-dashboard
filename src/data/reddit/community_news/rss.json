I use Inoreader to keep up with everything, but social platforms refuse to provide RSS feeds. **UnSocial** acts as a local companion app to your favorite reader, adding the RSS functionality these platforms need.\n\n# Why use it?\n\n* **Private Feeds:** Since it uses your own login, it can generate feeds for **private profiles and closed groups** you follow.\n* **100% Local & Private:** No third-party servers or telemetry. Your credentials and data never leave your machine, Everything is processed locally on your hardware.\n* **Zero Footprint:** A single portable Windows `.exe` (MIT License). Runs in the system tray and auto refreshes in the background.\n* **RSS Reader Integration:** Includes optional Cloudflare Tunnel support so you can access your local feeds on your RSS reader of choice.\n\n# How it compares to [Insert another tool name here]\n\nWhile tools like RSS-Bridge are great, **UnSocial** fills a different niche:\n\n1. **No Docker/Server Required:** It’s a portable Windows app.\n2. **Authenticated Content:** It handles private/authenticated content natively through your local browser session.\n3. **I couldn't find a free one that works.**\n\n# LLM Disclaimer\n\nI’m not a professional dev, so I used LLMs to help bridge the coding gap. It’s stable for daily use, though the code might have some rough edges.\n\nFeel free to contribute to the repo, and if this app helps you in anyway, I’d appreciate you [buying me a coffee here](https://buymeacoffee.com/uiuu3nugyy).\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/pynbbz/UnSocial](https://github.com/pynbbz/UnSocial)",

      "text": "Hey r/rss. I've been building an app called Newsie ([newsieapp.com](https://newsieapp.com/)) and wanted to get some real feedback from people who actually care about RSS.\n\nThe short version: it's a feed reader where you can also follow friends and see what they're reading and sharing. Think Google Reader's social features meets a modern RSS client. You follow websites, save articles, and optionally share things with friends who are also on the app.\n\nI built it because I missed the social side of Google Reader. I still use RSS daily, but I wanted a way to see what articles my friends found interesting without relying on Twitter/X or algorithmic feeds to surface that stuff.\n\n**Where it's at right now:**\n\n* Progressive web app (works on mobile and desktop, no app store download needed)\n* Free, no paid tier, no ads\n* Supports RSS/Atom, OPML import\n* Folders, read/unread, favorites\n* Social feed: follow friends, share articles, comment on shared posts\n* Still early - I'm a solo developer iterating based on user feedback\n\n**What I'm genuinely wrestling with:**\n\n1. For those of you who remember Google Reader's social features - is that something you actually miss, or is it nostalgia? Would you want social in your feed reader, or do you prefer keeping reading as a solo activity?\n2. I've been trying to make the app approachable for people who don't know what \"RSS\" means (using language like \"follow a website\" instead of \"add an RSS feed\"). Does that feel dumbed down to power users, or do you appreciate the clarity?\n3. What's the one thing that would make you actually try a new reader? I know switching costs are real.\n\nNot trying to sell anyone anything here. Just a solo dev looking for honest takes from the people who know this space best.",

Again, due to the broadcast orientation of RSS, TV/radio language works well I think. Also, YouTube “like and subscribe” is pretty well drilled into everyone’s heads at this point.\n\nI’ll give pretty much anything a go that’ll eat my OPML. I’d say the biggest hurdle is signup. There’s always the doubt in my mind, “Is this going to be worth the unwanted emails?”\n\nSocial may not be my cup of tea but there’s definitely gains for whoever figures out how to make a seamless blended experience.

So it’s still RSS-first, with an optional way to see what your friends are reading. If that wasn’t clear in my post, that’s good feedback on how I’m describing it.\n\nReally interesting that you landed on “Channel” and “Subscribe” - I went through the same exercise and ended up with “Follow a website.” The broadcast/TV framing is smart though, I hadn’t thought of it that way.\nAnd your point about signup friction is noted. That “is this worth the unwanted emails” hesitation is real. Good thing to keep front of mind.\n\nCool that you’re building in the space too. What are you working on?",

          "text": "Hi,\n\nSolid breakdown. A few thoughts from experience:\n\n**On rotating headers/user-agents:** This helps but Reddit's fingerprinting has gotten smarter. They look at header ordering and TLS fingerprints now, not just the UA string. If you're using Node's fetch or axios with default settings, you might still get flagged even with rotation.\n\n**On residential proxies:** Agreed they cost money, but datacenter IPs get burned fast on Reddit specifically. If you're self-hosting and hitting rate limits even with BullMQ, the IP reputation is likely the issue, not the request frequency.\n\n**One thing I'd add:** Reddit's `.json` endpoints (append `.json` to any feed URL) are more reliable than RSS for programmatic access. Same data, less parsing headaches, and they seem to have slightly higher rate limits in my testing.\n\n**On Puppeteer:** Overkill for RSS feeds unless you're doing something that requires JS rendering. The overhead isn't worth it for structured data that's already available via API/JSON.\n\nWhat's your current request volume looking like? That usually determines whether you need the full stack or can get away with simpler solutions.\n\nHope this helps!",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I wanted a simple, visual way to organize my feeds into widgets and tabs without having to pay for a subscription or set up any server.\n\nI ended up building a **static dashboard**. This means it runs entirely in your web browser—there is no server, and you don’t even need to create an account.\n\nQuick Demo: [https://rozhovetskyi.github.io/Dashboard/demo](https://rozhovetskyi.github.io/Dashboard/demo)\n\n**What it can do:**\n\n* **Thematic Tabs:** You can group feeds into specific topics (like \"Tech,\" \"Global News,\" or \"Finance\") to keep things organized and avoid distractions.\n* **Keep the widgets clean:**  You can set widgets to only show stories from the last N days (e.g., nothing older than 3 days) and limit the total number of items displayed.\n* **RSS & Google News:** Full support for standard feeds and specific Google News topics.\n* **Custom Widgets:** I added support for HTML widgets so you can embed things like weather, clocks, or stock tickers.\n\n**Why I built it this way:**\n\n* **Everything stays on your machine:** Your feed list and settings are saved in your browser's local storage. No data ever leaves your computer.\n* **Zero Setup:** You can use the live link above, or literally just download the code to your desktop and open the HTML file. It doesn't need a server to work.\n* **Portable:** You can export your entire layout to a file and import it on another device.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n* **The Easy Way:** Just open the [https://rozhovetskyi.github.io/Dashboard/](https://rozhovetskyi.github.io/Dashboard/) and start adding feeds.\n* **Complex Way:** Grab the code from [https://github.com/Rozhovetskyi/Dashboard](https://github.com/Rozhovetskyi/Dashboard) and host it yourself or run it locally or fork to you github.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts or if there are any features you think are missing! :)",
