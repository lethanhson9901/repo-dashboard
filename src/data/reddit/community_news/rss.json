I think the topic buttons could be smaller, and I think the articles opening right there in a reader mode would be nice. That's my main draw for my current RSS app, is it opens the article in app in a reader mode (and the organization it offers). I like that yours looks *different*, it's kinda refreshing.",

This is something we have in iOS and Android (when Google approves us) that elevates the experience.\n\nPerhaps an option to collapse the topics would useful?\n\nThank you for your feedback by the way. Really appreciate it!",
