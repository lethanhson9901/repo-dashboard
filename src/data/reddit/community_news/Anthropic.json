Recent case in point:\n\nHaving told it that there was an issue in unsubscribing to a datasource and giving examples:\n\n*Opus 4.5: When updates arrive for unknown subscription IDs, we now check if they're in this set and* ***silently ignore them instead of logging warnings***\\*.\\*\n\n*This will suppress the \"Unknown subscription ID\" spam you were seeing after unsubscribing.*\n\nI said: \"this is just hiding the issue - why would you suggest this?\"\n\nIt agreed \"*You're right, I apologize. The unsubscribe is clearly not working properly on the server side.* \"\n\nHaving interviewed many for my software company, I'd say it's on a par with a distinctly average undergrad at best. Sure, it can be hugely productive, and it often follows conventional practice in coding layout and approaches, though this is not always good practice and an issue in its own right that I'm trying to address with it. Sometimes it cannot see bugs in logic and calculations even when explained clearly what's wrong; it'll use its domain knowledge and agree, possibly fixing the issue, but at the next edit it can set that aside and the bug comes back. Yes code can get churned out quickly and a lot of drudgery is gone, but there can be days of work afterwards undoing the janky coding and solving of subtle bugs that a skilled dev would have never introduced. \n\nIt can often spot flaws in code when given a debug log, if not at the first time then on the second or third attempt, but it wasn't smart enough not to make the flaws in the first place. In contrast, a skilled and experienced developer would get it right upfront. It's not great at using its own initiative to add debugging code, and needs guidance on techniques for getting information that will help it. It's not good at finding the balance between what should be in an ABC vs. a concrete implementation. It has a long way to go. But of course, still using it :)",

But now k2.5 is out! \n\nI use claude code, with it the agent, Work flow works unattended for at least a few minutes. Opencode is good also, doesn't run as long unattended.  ( but works with k2.5 well )\n\nFor agents https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents\n\nFor skills https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-skills\n\nI am running it with this api gateway ( check your toc ) https://github.com/looplj/axonhub\n\nFor a main provider I use synthetic.new , great performance and privacy is much better than most. Text models but have optional image on demand available. You can back that up with Claude code or a ZAI account or anti gravity, etc. I believe official Claude code and anti gravity support are coming soon.\n\nI have a referral link  \"Invite your friends to Synthetic and both of you will receive $10.00 for standard signups. $20.00 for pro signups. in subscription credit when they subscribe!\" \n\nhttps://synthetic.new/?referral=UAWqkKQQLFkzMkY\n\nI am on my second month and on the $60 plan which gives you 1350 requests every 5 hours without a weekly limit. Should give about 5x a cluade code max plan.\n\nAnywho long story longer... It gives you a lower cost option with a higher quota to use with other plans via the api gateway. \n\n\nMaybe its helpful, 🤔\n\nGood luck on everything",

Hell, the recent Constitution doc was written with Claude as the primary audience, not the users. There are some debates about the true nature of that doc but I leave that to people who are smarter than me. \n\nI truly think that Amanda Askell and her team are the heart of Anthropic and as long as she is there, they will “raise” a very capable “child” with endless potential.",

          "text": "One primary use case was to use hooks to reduce tool output. For example, in the past, I found that Claude Code ran `go test` or `mvn clean verify` inconsistently, and as the project grew in size, the context window will be filled up. Instead of just blocking the commands through permissions (Claude always seems to find a workaround), I use hooks to redirect it to scripts or makefiles I wrote; so the hook denies running `go test`, but instructs Claude Code to use `make test` or just `./test`. Those then pipe the output to a separate file, and only print test names and whether they succeeded or failed; and for larger projects, it simply prints instructions where test logs are stored, and then prints SUCCESS or FAILED.\n\nIn addition, I use a hook to block commands like `cat`, `echo` etc, and instruct Claude to use other tools; again, the purpose is to conserve tokens.\n\nOver time, I noticed Claude Code doing the same things over and over using shell, Python, and whatnot, so I just wrote Go equivalents for that and instructed Claude to use them instead.\n\nI use pre-commit, taking care of things during commit, but the problem is that it can be hours after the code was written, so I essentially run linting, formatting, etc when Claude modifies files, to prevent Claude from getting into a giant mess.\n\nMuch of the optimization around Claude Code is about context management. For example, I'd instruct Claude to create a plan where each task can be completed in a single context window, and then delegate those tasks to a background agent. Even when it comes to skills, etc, context matters.",

So phase 1 might use part 2, 3 and 5 of the design plan but the rest isnt needed. \n\nThen I create 4 new folders \n\"Script references\"\n\"Good coding practices\"\n\"Clean coding practices\" \nAnd depending on what I'm building a \"good insert what type of thing Im building practices\" this last one is specific to whatever it is Im creating, so if I'm making a prototype video game in unity for example it will be \"good unity practices\" etc. \n\nAnd in each folder will be an Md file relevant to the folder name. \n\nThen I ask Claude to include a link to each of this above every implementation phase with a header \"important read these before every phase\" and \"update the script reference file after making or changing scripts\" \n\nThe script reference file includes the scripts name, its function, where and why it's used, links to each scripts location in the project, and important information like what namespaces they use and links to any plans I might create that those scripts where made in or are relevant to. \n\nSo instead of Claude needing to dig through my project as it increases in size, it just has to reference an md file relevant to what I'm working on and can follow the link allowing it to instantly navigate to its location in order to save time and context.\n\nEdit * forgot to mention I also have a folder called \"session documents\" and \"archived documents\" whenever we work together, I get Claude to document everything we do during a session, if the session was successful i get Claude to place the document md file in the archived folder, but if there is still resolution needed or obvious bugs present or simply needs tweaking, I get Claude to make a \"session report\" Md file, these will also include links to any scripts made during this session, the script reference file, the phase Md file, etc. \n\nI usually end up with about 30 - 40 Md files before I even start a project. \n\nAnd constantly creating more as a project continues. \n\nI find doing this helps keep Claude on track and helps prevent a lot of hallucinations, mistakes, and conflicts during code creation.",

That is a statistically significant deviation from reality if I have ever heard one.\n\nI would tell my grad students this all the time: calculation is not the same as comprehension. An AI might be able to perturb a Hamiltonian faster than I can grade a stack of midterms (which, admittedly, did take me a while), but deriving novel physical laws requires an intuition that I am not convinced can be purely synthesized from training data. We may get there, but as of now, we are a ways out.\n\nIt reminds me of when Mathematica first launched... everyone said it would make us obsolete. Instead, we just spent the next decade debugging syntax errors.\n\nI will believe it when a neural net solves the hierarchy problem without hallucinating a non-existent particle. Until then, my hypothesis remains null.\n\n\\~Greg",

Since we're just making a list of random technical terms to impress clueless readers, why not mention the AI also generated a grammar and a lexer? A language needs those as well.

Close to every language has one, even non strongly-typed ones.  \n\\- *three compilers*: this is just using a very vague definition of a compiler. The language has zero actual compilers, it just naively transpiles to JS, Ruby or SQL.

      "text": "Hey Everyone!\n\nI have been following the development of MCP closely, and I believe it is the most significant shift in AI architecture we have seen in years. Finally, we have a standardized way to connect models to state. But now that we have the protocol, the question becomes: What do we build with it?\n\nMost people are using MCP to connect databases (RAG). But as a researcher in cognitive systems, I saw an opportunity to use MCP for something more ambitious: implementing actual biological memory dynamics.\n\n\n\nWe have spent the last few years obsessed with the engine and largely ignored the fuel. We have the best software engineering model in the world with Opus. We have the perfect protocol for connecting data with MCP. But we are still fundamentally stuck with stateless models. The moment you kill the context window, the agent dies. It learns nothing. It retains nothing.\n\nCurrent approaches try to patch this with RAG and vector DBs. But as someone who has looked deeply at both biological and computational systems, I believe RAG is a category error. It retrieves based on lexical or semantic match. It does not retrieve based on behavioral importance.\n\nFor the past year, I have been working on Vestige. It is a Rust-based memory system. Today I am releasing it as an MCP Server that plugs directly into Claude Desktop. It is not a database. It is an attempt to model the dynamics of human declarative memory. The goal is to shift the paradigm from Reading Files to Modeling State.\n\nThe Problem. Static Importance.\n\nIf you correct Claude on a specific coding pattern today, standard memory tools just store that correction as a text chunk. They have no mechanism to understand the significance of that event.\n\nVestige implements Synaptic Tagging and Capture: When an importance event like a correction occurs, the system scans a retroactive window and hardens the relevant context. This simulates the biological protein synthesis window. It is the difference between writing a note and actually learning a lesson.\n\nThis is a ground up implementation of cognitive neuroscience principles in Rust. I chose Rust because Python simply cannot handle the graph traversal at this granularity without massive overhead.\n\n1. Synaptic Tagging and Capture Memories are fragile until consolidated by a signal. Vestige maintains a transient buffer. When an error is detected, the system consolidates the preceding context retroactively. In your next chat, Claude remembers your preference not because of a system prompt, but because the memory was prioritized.\n\n2. FSRS-6 Forgetting Curves Forgetting is not linear. It follows a power law. Utilizing a 21-parameter decay algorithm, the system develops a working set of knowledge. High-signal context that you retrieve frequently remains chemically fresh, while noise naturally decays. The context window becomes a curated stream of consciousness rather than a garbage dump of history.\n\n3. Spreading Activation Neurons that fire together, wire together. Memories are stored as nodes in a weighted graph. Activation energy spreads to neighbors. If you ask about Project A, the system primes the node for Team Member B, even if the prompt creates no semantic vector overlap. It simulates intuition.\n\nI am specifically looking for feedback from those of you working with MCP. Does anyone have experience with passive memory retrieval in MCP where the server pushes context without a specific tool call? How are you handling the noise vs signal balance in your own MCP setups when dealing with graph retrieval?\n\nRepo and Install Instructions: [https://github.com/samvallad33/vestige](https://github.com/samvallad33/vestige)",

I like the framing of importance driven consolidation vs naive RAG chunks.\n\nOn the passive retrieval question, Ive mostly seen people approximate it by having a lightweight \"memory prefetch\" tool call at the start of each turn (so it feels push-like, but is still pull). Curious if your graph activation can be exposed as \"top-k primed nodes\" without blowing up token budget.\n\nAlso, your approach reminds me of some of the bio-inspired memory patterns folks discuss here: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/",
