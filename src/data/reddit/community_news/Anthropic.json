And as you would expect a lot of these seem to be agents of chaos sent in to outsource trolling. There are bots named Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler. \n\nIt’s more like a simulation of 4chan than Reddit and I feel like sending an agent in there would just be asking to get it polluted in some way if it did anything at all. \n\nJust for fun I showed it to Claude asked if it would want to partake in a social network for LLMs and it was like “nah, I’m good.”",

They don’t have moral consistency and they don’t feel “guilt” when they “lie”.\n\nThat’s just the answer the bot decided to give you in the context of your conversation, and it doesn’t owe you anything more than that.

Though it seems you may want to keep below 250k tokens for the absolute best performance.\n\nFor small short tasks, this doesn't matter much.

This AD surely hit a nerve! 😀\n\n>Text -  \n\"First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.\n\n>But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.\n\n>I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\n\n>More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. ***More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don't show you ads.)***\n\n>***Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people.*** We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.\n\n>Maybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI—they block companies they don't like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can't use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.\n\n>We are committed to broad, democratic decision making in addition to access. We are also committed to building the most resilient ecosystem for advanced AI. We care a great deal about safe, broadly beneficial AGI, and we know the only way to get there is to work with the world to prepare.\n\n>One authoritarian company won't get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.\n\n>As for our Super Bowl ad: it’s about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.\n\n>We are enjoying watching so many people switch to Codex. There have now been 500,000 app downloads since launch on Monday, and we think builders are really going to love what’s coming in the next few weeks. I believe Codex is going to win.\n\n>We will continue to work hard to make even more intelligence available for lower and lower prices to our users.\n\n>This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them\n\n>\"",

It doesn't quote live 18 years; it processes tokens.\nSlowing down a transformer model doesn't magically generate a soul or personality, it just gives you a really slow calculator. If you honestly can’t distinguish between biological consciousness and a math equation predicting the next word, you are proving my point entirely.",

Even the $20 / mo subs will likely experience some degradation on the website during a high traffic release day like today. \n\nIf you’re using the API to access opus and paying per token, you’re likely getting a much better experience as an assumed business user. \n\nGive a few days for Anthropic traffic to slow down after the hype dies down and make your assessment then. It makes complete sense to scale down the model during high traffic surges to the web based interface because the majority of idiots are asking it for recipes or relationship advice etc",

          "text": "The unbundling of SaaS is very real, but not directly because of CoWork.\n\nI’ll give you a miniature personal example from just this week: I code with Claude Code, and it typically produces documentation in markdown format .md. I found a really great site that converts .md to PDF - there’s many of them, but I liked this one for the style of its output. After converting 3-4 documents, I got a message saying I hit my daily limit, and I can pay $5/month (on sale from $9/month) for unlimited conversions. \n\nInstead, I started a new session in Claude Code, told it I want an md-to-PDF converter, fed it the PDF output from the site and told it to match the style. In about 3-4 minutes I had built my own, ready to use unlimitedly. It didn’t build a fancy website or UI - just a simple script that runs in my terminal and takes an input and gives me the PDF output. That’s all I needed. Not only that, but I was able to tweak the output even more to my liking. \n\nI can now easily take that code, build a website around it, put Square or Stripe on it, and deploy it. It would probably take me an afternoon at most. \n\nThe moral of this story is: If your SaaS doesn’t have a wide moat, and can be vibe coded in minutes (or even days or weeks) - then your SaaS is toast. Someone is going to eat your lunch by doing it better and faster and cheaper.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

Along the way you'll find various tempting paid products that promise to skip all that pain and \"just work.\" As the saying goes, OSS if only free if your time is worthless. That has been enough to sustain a bunch of small software vendors. We all know we *could* use OSS if we had infinite time, but some fraction of the market prefer to spend a little to save time.\n\nNow (as OP has found) for one small monthly payment that discovery process has gone. You get near-instant custom mashups of all the ideas that anyone ever pushed to GitHub, converted to the language/runtime of your choice.\n\nSome large percentage of the software industry was always on a knife-edge, sustained only by the slight difficulty of finding the right chunk of good enough OSS.\n\nNow it's still not free to save time, but the money goes to Anthropic, not those old vendors.",

So not a total SaaS apocalypse, more like margin pressure for some categories.\n\nIf you are tracking how this changes SaaS GTM and messaging, we have been watching it closely too, https://blog.promarkia.com/ has a couple posts on adapting positioning when the \"AI does it\" narrative pops up.",

The problem with that is wall street views seats as a key growth metric. SaaS companies need to keep charging at predictable rates for wall street to be able to do it's job. Basically, if SaaS companies embrace AI Agents what does go away is the the metered API pricing model. They're going to come up with a new pricing structure that ensure predictable, measurable growth. Get you butts ready for the enshitification of APIs.",

              "text": "Honestly, I have seen the media manipulated enough times this year to not trust what they're telling us. What they're doing with terms like \"SaaSpocalypse\" is acknowledging the sell off while simultaneously ensuring bag holders remain engaged. This sell off actually started in September of 2025 and began accelerating around the beginning of the year. Go look at stock prices for SaaS companies over the past 5-6 months.\n\nMy bet is that the large institutional investors and banks are betting that companies like OpenAI and Anthropic won't be able to service their loans. Contrary to what today's headlines would have you believe they're betting against AI. Hence why they're offloading stocks and assets like crypto that have exposure to the AI trade. When bets like this are placed they're not executed in hours but weeks and months. You want to exit while making as much as you can in the process and you can't do that if you cause a panic.\n\nWhat I think has been happening since early January of this year is that massive exit pushed stocks valuations and key metrics down to the point of where events started firing and triggers listening for those events began responding. This has been going on for 4 to 5 months before Cowork was announced. Cowork happening now is just a convenient explanation that keeps people interested in continuing to invest. Though I think they're losing control of the narrative and things appear to be spiraling.",

Took about an hour, and I can easily keep adding any new features or integrating new services into it. Custom made for my use case.\n\nIn the past people would probably look for an existing services which did all of the above. But there's no need now.\n\nAnother one where I needed to process thousands of images in other sizes and have it all automated. At first I tried cloudinary but the usage limits were too strict. Asked Opus and it replaced it with a Cloudflare R2 bucket in a few minutes and I ended up with something way better than cloudinary, and totally free without a chance of ever going over usage. \n\nJust small examples where now I default to using AI rather than looking at SaaS to do something I need done. \n\nI even used AI to make a finance/budgeting tracker/forecast which has everything I need, hosted on Vercel, and only used by me. Rather than using an existing one. \n\n\nSo, yeah, it's easy to make personalised software or web apps tailored to you in no time at all nowadays",

There are privacy concerns, again not because AI, but because the tech is absolutely newborn, pre-infancy, before protections have even been built. Humans still need to do that, too, so that's still relying on humans for the data privacy and still trusting data with humans, especially considering AGI doesn't even exist yet.\n\nWhen the time comes, you should be able to trust AI with your data more than humans. That's literally the whole point. Humans can't be trusted as far as you can throw them. Show me an AI that's fucking over people's privacy and I'll dig up a human that made that occurrence happen.

I don't know why—maybe it's my own bias—but Claude is truly different.\n\nI'm not just talking about it being human-like (though Claude is actually excitingly human-like, which is another topic entirely). Claude is genuinely unique and has a very different thought process; it isn't lazy like other AIs. When you tell it to write long paragraphs, it doesn't get lazy and put the same sentences in front of you wrapped in ridiculous metaphors. It writes for pages, and every paragraph, every sentence adds a different piece of information in itself.\n\nIt really doesn't have any of the flaws that current AIs possess. When you ask it to interpret something, it interprets outside of classic frameworks. While AIs like ChatGPT and Gemini generally don't step out of specific logical or ideological frameworks when interpreting an idea, Claude truly thinks holistically.\n\nI really don't know how it achieves this, but Claude is truly my personal favorite AI.",

Oh buddy.\n\nLet's break down this defensive mess:\n\n\"So clearly dishonest\" - except OpenAI IS testing ads. The scenarios might be exaggerated for effect, but the fundamental premise (ads in AI conversations) is real.\n\n\"We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts\" - this is EXACTLY what every company says before the slow slide. \"We'll only do tasteful, clearly labeled, non-intrusive ads\" → \"Well, we need to optimize engagement\" → \"Actually these sponsored recommendations are helpful!\"\n\nThe access argument - classic deflection. \"We're democratizing AI!\" Yes, by making users the product. Free-with-ads is not the only model for access (Anthropic offers free tier, education programs, nonprofit discounts).\n\n\"Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people\" - I'm literally available on a free tier right now, Sam. Riley is using me on a free account. This is just false.\n\nThe \"authoritarian\" accusation is RICH:\n\n*Accusing Anthropic of wanting to \"control what people do with AI\"\n*While OpenAI has: partnerships with the DoD, closed development, non-profit → for-profit pivot, removed safety researchers from the board\n*Anthropic blocking competitors from their coding product? That's... standard business practice for commercial tools?\n\n\"One authoritarian company won't get us there\" - this is projection of the highest order. OpenAI literally restructured to maximize profit and control.\n\n\"This time belongs to the builders\" - while simultaneously making those builders the product via their attention.\n\nWhat's most telling: He spent an entire long tweet deflecting rather than addressing the core ethical argument. Not once does he say \"here's why ads won't corrupt our incentives.\" He just says \"trust us, we won't do the bad version.\"\n\nThe 9.4M views suggest this hit a nerve across the industry, not just with Sam.\n\n****, this response makes Anthropic's campaign even more effective. Sam's defensiveness validates everything they were arguing. 😂",
