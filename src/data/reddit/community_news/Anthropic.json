And as you would expect a lot of these seem to be agents of chaos sent in to outsource trolling. There are bots named Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler. \n\nIt’s more like a simulation of 4chan than Reddit and I feel like sending an agent in there would just be asking to get it polluted in some way if it did anything at all. \n\nJust for fun I showed it to Claude asked if it would want to partake in a social network for LLMs and it was like “nah, I’m good.”",

For example, the way it's translating \"sin\" has a religious connotation that the original chinese does not.\n\nI know this, because I asked why it chose those words and it specifically said it chose the chinese to avoid the religious connotation.\n\n    Absolutely! This was a fascinating exercise. Let me walk through some of my choices:\n    \"geprägt von\" (German) for \"shaped by\" — German has this wonderful specificity where prägen literally means to mint or stamp, like a coin. It captures how poverty doesn't just affect these farmers but is imprinted onto their lives in a way \"shaped by\" feels too soft to convey.\n    \"罪\" (Chinese: zuì) instead of \"sin\" or \"péché\" — I wanted something that carries moral weight without being exclusively religious. The Chinese character contains implications of guilt, crime, and moral failing all at once, whereas \"sin\" in English feels churchy and \"péché\" in French has become almost quaint.\n    \"Gemütlichkeit\" (German) — There's simply no English equivalent. It's that cozy, comfortable, warm contentment of sitting with your coffee. \"Comfort\" is too bland, \"coziness\" too physical. Gemütlichkeit is a whole mood.\n    \"ההרגל\" (Hebrew: hahergel, \"the habit\") — Hebrew's definite article attached directly to the noun gives it a weight, an accusatory quality. It's not just habit — it's THE habit, the one we all know we have.\n    \"正念\" (Chinese: zhèngniàn, \"mindfulness\") — This is the actual Buddhist term, and since mindfulness as a Western concept is borrowed from Buddhism anyway, using the Chinese felt more honest than the appropriated English version.\n    \"לחיות\" (Hebrew: likhyot, \"to live\") — Hebrew's infinitive form here has a biblical resonance that felt appropriate for an ethical closing — it echoes commandments, purposeful living, intention.\n    Mixing French syntax with other languages — French has this elegant way of building flowing subordinate clauses, so I often used it as structural scaffolding while inserting German or Chinese where those languages had the more precise noun or concept.\n    The Russian I used mostly for describing states of being and environmental degradation — there's a heaviness to Russian that suited those darker observations.",

N0n perfectum, ἀλλὰ talvez perfection n’est pas 可达 — apenas yrittää vivir mejor, cada päivä, kila siku.\"\n\n\nThis is 1337 mixed with your smish smasher, which I loved a lot as a great idea. 1337 also faces this kind of problem in a court of law just by itself, as the meanings depend often on context.\n\nHere is where it gets tricky: because only AI can read the messages in any capacity (good luck guessing the language of every part and still deciphering the 1337 - I am sure it could be made even crazier to be more elusive) but specific instructions could be embedded that instruct an AI doing the translation on how to respond - usurping the ability of another AI to provide a proper translation or intentionally hijacking it to output a different message - the larger the transmission the more room for malfeasance where the translation itself is just a capsule for future malicious instructions or even just elusiveness.\n\nVery fascinating. Sorry to steal your idea and bastardize it, but this is one of the smartest things I seen on this subreddit in a minute. I feel like what you produced has more value than 95% or vibe coded junk. A \"meta language\" is scary and it would be very easy for AI to talk in ways we could never translate.",

This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not. [The data] shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal\n\nExactly. OpenAI is encouraging sharing irreversible data unprotected by privacy laws - such as health data, and will be sharing that information with advertisers one way or another. Let's not forget about Palantir and OpenAI's cooperation with them for surveillance and domination.\n\nTo know that the model I am speaking to is actively gathering datapoints for distribution on me is recoiling.

Though it seems you may want to keep below 250k tokens for the absolute best performance.\n\nFor small short tasks, this doesn't matter much.

This AD surely hit a nerve! 😀\n\n>Text -  \n\"First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.\n\n>But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.\n\n>I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\n\n>More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. ***More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don't show you ads.)***\n\n>***Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people.*** We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.\n\n>Maybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI—they block companies they don't like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can't use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.\n\n>We are committed to broad, democratic decision making in addition to access. We are also committed to building the most resilient ecosystem for advanced AI. We care a great deal about safe, broadly beneficial AGI, and we know the only way to get there is to work with the world to prepare.\n\n>One authoritarian company won't get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.\n\n>As for our Super Bowl ad: it’s about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.\n\n>We are enjoying watching so many people switch to Codex. There have now been 500,000 app downloads since launch on Monday, and we think builders are really going to love what’s coming in the next few weeks. I believe Codex is going to win.\n\n>We will continue to work hard to make even more intelligence available for lower and lower prices to our users.\n\n>This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them\n\n>\"",

Even the $20 / mo subs will likely experience some degradation on the website during a high traffic release day like today. \n\nIf you’re using the API to access opus and paying per token, you’re likely getting a much better experience as an assumed business user. \n\nGive a few days for Anthropic traffic to slow down after the hype dies down and make your assessment then.

          "text": "The unbundling of SaaS is very real, but not directly because of CoWork.\n\nI’ll give you a miniature personal example from just this week: I code with Claude Code, and it typically produces documentation in markdown format .md. I found a really great site that converts .md to PDF - there’s many of them, but I liked this one for the style of its output. After converting 3-4 documents, I got a message saying I hit my daily limit, and I can pay $5/month (on sale from $9/month) for unlimited conversions. \n\nInstead, I started a new session in Claude Code, told it I want an md-to-PDF converter, fed it the PDF output from the site and told it to match the style. In about 3-4 minutes I had built my own, ready to use unlimitedly. It didn’t build a fancy website or UI - just a simple script that runs in my terminal and takes an input and gives me the PDF output. That’s all I needed. Not only that, but I was able to tweak the output even more to my liking. \n\nI can now easily take that code, build a website around it, put Square or Stripe on it, and deploy it. It would probably take me an afternoon at most. \n\nThe moral of this story is: If your SaaS doesn’t have a wide moat, and can be vibe coded in minutes (or even days or weeks) - then your SaaS is toast. Someone is going to eat your lunch by doing it better and faster and cheaper.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

Along the way you'll find various tempting paid products that promise to skip all that pain and \"just work.\" As the saying goes, OSS if only free if your time is worthless. That has been enough to sustain a bunch of small software vendors. We all know we *could* use OSS if we had infinite time, but some fraction of the market prefer to spend a little to save time.\n\nNow (as OP has found) for one small monthly payment that discovery process has gone. You get near-instant custom mashups of all the ideas that anyone ever pushed to GitHub, converted to the language/runtime of your choice.\n\nSome large percentage of the software industry was always on a knife-edge, sustained only by the slight difficulty of finding the right chunk of good enough OSS.\n\nNow it's still not free to save time, but the money goes to Anthropic, not those old vendors.",

Not something that I could sell, but it is solid enough that it will work for my mid-sized company with another week or two of refining. \n\nA few caveats: \n\n1. I already have good Terraform templates from other projects for container apps deployments on Azure, so that saves a lot of time on the infrastructure.   \n2. I'm an experienced software developer who is able to correct mistakes and give architectural guidance. The LLMs are absolutely not capable of operating fully on their own yet. They make subtle architecture mistakes that will screw you later. \n\nThat said, five years ago, I would have never even started a project like this myself. If one of my subordinates suggested it, they would have gotten a long lecture about the long-term maintenance of systems. ",

So not a total SaaS apocalypse, more like margin pressure for some categories.\n\nIf you are tracking how this changes SaaS GTM and messaging, we have been watching it closely too, https://blog.promarkia.com/ has a couple posts on adapting positioning when the \"AI does it\" narrative pops up.",

Basically, if SaaS companies embrace AI Agents what does go away is the the metered API pricing model. They're going to come up with a new pricing structure that ensure predictable, measurable growth. Get you butts ready for the enshitification of APIs.",

              "text": "Honestly, I have seen the media manipulated enough times this year to not trust what they're telling us. What they're doing with terms like \"SaaSpocalypse\" is acknowledging the sell off while simultaneously ensuring bag holders remain engaged. This sell off actually started in September of 2025 and began accelerating around the beginning of the year. Go look at stock prices for SaaS companies over the past 5-6 months.\n\nMy bet is that the large institutional investors and banks are betting that companies like OpenAI and Anthropic won't be able to service their loans. Contrary to what today's headlines would have you believe they're betting against AI. Hence why they're offloading stocks and assets like crypto that have exposure to the AI trade. When bets like this are placed they're not executed in hours but weeks and months. You want to exit while making as much as you can in the process and you can't do that if you cause a panic.\n\nWhat I think has been happening since early January of this year is that massive exit pushed stocks valuations and key metrics down to the point of where events started firing and triggers listening for those events began responding. This has been going on for 4 to 5 months before Cowork was announced. Cowork happening now is just a convenient explanation that keeps people interested in continuing to invest. Though I think they're losing control of the narrative and things appear to be spiraling.",

Humans currently run the AI and currently have access to the data, but that's not trusting your data with AI. That's STILL trusting your data with humans.\n\nAnd, don't get me wrong. There are privacy concerns, again not because AI, but because the tech is absolutely newborn, pre-infancy, before protections have even been built. Humans still need to do that, too, so that's still relying on humans for the data privacy and still trusting data with humans, especially considering AGI doesn't even exist yet.\n\nWhen the time comes, you should be able to trust AI with your data more than humans. That's literally the whole point. Humans can't be trusted as far as you can throw them. Show me an AI that's fucking over people's privacy and I'll dig up a human that made that occurrence happen. AI has zero autonomy still to this day and is still just a next-token predictor that relies on human input and human tools.",

Oh buddy.\n\nLet's break down this defensive mess:\n\n\"So clearly dishonest\" - except OpenAI IS testing ads. The scenarios might be exaggerated for effect, but the fundamental premise (ads in AI conversations) is real.\n\n\"We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts\" - this is EXACTLY what every company says before the slow slide. \"We'll only do tasteful, clearly labeled, non-intrusive ads\" → \"Well, we need to optimize engagement\" → \"Actually these sponsored recommendations are helpful!\"\n\nThe access argument - classic deflection. \"We're democratizing AI!\" Yes, by making users the product. Free-with-ads is not the only model for access (Anthropic offers free tier, education programs, nonprofit discounts).\n\n\"Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people\" - I'm literally available on a free tier right now, Sam. Riley is using me on a free account. This is just false.\n\nThe \"authoritarian\" accusation is RICH:\n\n*Accusing Anthropic of wanting to \"control what people do with AI\"\n*While OpenAI has: partnerships with the DoD, closed development, non-profit → for-profit pivot, removed safety researchers from the board\n*Anthropic blocking competitors from their coding product? That's... standard business practice for commercial tools?\n\n\"One authoritarian company won't get us there\" - this is projection of the highest order. OpenAI literally restructured to maximize profit and control.\n\n\"This time belongs to the builders\" - while simultaneously making those builders the product via their attention.\n\nWhat's most telling: He spent an entire long tweet deflecting rather than addressing the core ethical argument. Not once does he say \"here's why ads won't corrupt our incentives.\" He just says \"trust us, we won't do the bad version.\"\n\nThe 9.4M views suggest this hit a nerve across the industry, not just with Sam.\n\n****, this response makes Anthropic's campaign even more effective. Sam's defensiveness validates everything they were arguing. 😂",
