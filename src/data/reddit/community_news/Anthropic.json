I can't imagine that'll go over well with the defense industry. Additionally we'd have a situation where an American company is given this designation for no real reason. That alone could chill the whole tech ecosystem in not positive ways. I'm not saying the Trump Admin wouldn't do it, but it would be incredibly stupid if they did. As for using war powers to compel access, well, lawsuit city and my guess is the Government would lose. It'd be a stupid battle to fight as it'd defang that threat when they want to use it in the future. If I had to guess, Hegseth will try to make good TV out of cancelling the contract, but leave it at that. The other options just don't work out for them. That said, I don't take the current administration as particularly strategic or thoughtful, so they could do the dumbest possible thing and try to call it a win. ",

And when that assessment comes back from the defense contractors, who were asked to analyze and quantify their exposure, I'm 100% sure it's going to say that all of our \"top guys\" are using Claude models, because they're the best ones out.

Right now, if you ask Claude how to make a bomb or plan an attack on people, it refuses. The Pentagon wants a version with those refusals stripped out completely.  \n  \nThis is illegal for two reasons:  \nFirst, the law they’re threatening to use ( the Defense Production Act ) was written to force companies to manufacture physical things like weapons and supplies during wartime. It was never intended to force a software company to rewrite its code.  \nSecond, and most importantly, Congress just passed a law TWO MONTHS AGO requiring the military to use AI that follows ethical guidelines. The executive branch cannot override a law Congress already passed. That’s unconstitutional …basic separation of powers.  \n  \nSo Hegseth is essentially trying to bully a private company into building an unrestricted AI that could help plan attacks and make weapons , while simultaneously ignoring a law Congress just signed.  \nIf they follow through, they will lose in court.\n\n  \n[https://www.axios.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-pentagon-claude-hegseth-dario](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-pentagon-claude-hegseth-dario)",

If things are severely bad, that was always part of the political risk of moving forward safety.  Que sera sera.\n\nInvoking laws just needs to be enough to get through the agencies (stacked under executive branch), Congress (defunct for now), and Courts (explicitly not allowed to interfere with supply chain risk threat).  How a supply chain risk designation is handled would be life or death for Anthropic.  It's not high odds but not impossible that people will spend political capital to take Anthropic out of frontier AI competition.  Or even crush it.  \n\nLetter of the law supply chain risk designation is mostly inconvenience.  A slap on the wrist and treated like Huawei.  Anthropic's revenue can handle losing outright defense related work.  Which is sort of why I don't expect letter of the law supply chain risk as it can be a cultural win for Anthropic.  \n\nThe way the government is framing supply chain risk is for a chilling effect that ANY business using Anthropic products or contracts can be coerced in defense contracts - 'cut off Anthropic or do us favors'.  Most importantly server contracts with AWS.  That'd spook a lot of business community though, so I don't think the timing is right to try that.  Maybe if AGI models are months away and government still lacks safeguards. \n\nI doubt Anthropic will be crippled or compromise their safety image that drew a lot of their staff.  It'll hurt though.  Before anything else, this about threatening a political enemy to be humiliated for public and private reasons.  Oligarchy gangsterism against a \"woke\" aligned AI company that doesn't sufficiently play ball in outputs, backrooms, or public pageantry.\n\nPretending as if the DPA can coerce certain compromises can buy Anthropic time until they've any shot at rebelling without tanking market leads and their upcoming IPO.  That would be face saving for both parties, but it's not sure that certain figures will tolerate Anthropic saving face.\n\nYou know what else Congress passed just months ago?  Streamlining how easy it is for the Executive Branch to declare supply chain risks.  It's a materially irrelevant procedural streamline but demonstrates ongoing awareness the presidential power would be overused like the tariff authority.\n\nIt has always been a gamble whether Anthropic can survive with ethics intact during US's democracy turmoil.  Today that still stands at \"probably?\"\n\nThat's probably enough detail.  We may know the outcome as soon as tomorrow.",

It can help debug a Kubernetes cluster or write a research paper. But real-time weapons targeting? Autonomous drone coordination? Kill chain execution at millisecond latency? That's not what this architecture does. You'd want purpose-built systems with sensor fusion, real-time control loops, hardened deterministic response times. Not a transformer that thinks in tokens.\n\nThe Pentagon already has those systems. Palantir builds them. Anduril builds them. L3Harris builds them. The idea that the entire autonomous weapons program hinges on whether Claude has guardrails is... theatrical.\n\nAnd if you read this thru an the lens that Anthropic is corporation. They took a $200 million defense contract. They partnered with Palantir for classified networks. They launched Claude Gov. They offered $1 pricing to undercut competitors for government market share. And now they're drawing a very public line on two narrow issues — autonomous weapons and mass surveillance — while the contract they already signed permits an enormous range of military applications.\n\nThat's not a company that's anti-military. That's a company managing its brand while maximizing its market. The standoff generates press coverage that reinforces the \"safety-first\" narrative, which is their core differentiator against OpenAI and xAI. Whether or not the Friday deadline results in anything, Anthropic gets to be the company that \"stood up to the Pentagon.\"\n\nI'm not saying it's cynical. It might be genuinely principled people navigating impossible tradeoffs. But the strategic incentives align perfectly with the public positioning, and have to notice that.\n\n",

Using DPA to force a company to remove ethical guardrails from its product would be an unprecedented legal stretch that would almost certainly fail in court.\n\nAnd what laws? Here:\n\nSeveral laws would potentially be violated. It will also break the constitution so I’ll mix them.\n1. First Amendment\nCoercing a company to remove ethical/safety guardrails on speech-generating AI as a condition of avoiding government punishment is compelled speech … a well-established First Amendment violation.\n2. Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\nA supply chain designation used as a political weapon rather than a genuine security finding would be “arbitrary and capricious” agency action … directly challengeable under the APA.\n3. Fifth Amendment … Due Process\nUsing regulatory designations to economically destroy a company for refusing government demands …without legitimate legal basis … is a deprivation of property without due process.\n4. Anti-Commandeering Doctrine\nThe government cannot simply commandeer private property or compel private companies to serve government purposes without proper legal authority and compensation.\n5. The Coercion Doctrine\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled the government cannot use funding threats or regulatory penalties to coerce compliance with demands it has no direct legal authority to make. NFIB v. Sebelius established this clearly.",

      "text": "Statement: https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war\n\nFull text:\n\nStatement from Dario Amodei on our discussions with the Department of War\n\nI believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries.\n\nAnthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community. We were the first frontier AI company to deploy our models in the US government’s classified networks, the first to deploy them at the National Laboratories, and the first to provide custom models for national security customers. Claude is extensively deployed across the Department of War and other national security agencies for mission-critical applications, such as intelligence analysis, modeling and simulation, operational planning, cyber operations, and more.\n\nAnthropic has also acted to defend America’s lead in AI, even when it is against the company’s short-term interest. We chose to forgo several hundred million dollars in revenue to cut off the use of Claude by firms linked to the Chinese Communist Party (some of whom have been designated by the Department of War as Chinese Military Companies), shut down CCP-sponsored cyberattacks that attempted to abuse Claude, and have advocated for strong export controls on chips to ensure a democratic advantage.\n\nAnthropic understands that the Department of War, not private companies, makes military decisions. We have never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner.\n\nHowever, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values. Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do. Two such use cases have never been included in our contracts with the Department of War, and we believe they should not be included now:\n\nMass domestic surveillance. We support the use of AI for lawful foreign intelligence and counterintelligence missions. But using these systems for mass domestic surveillance is incompatible with democratic values. AI-driven mass surveillance presents serious, novel risks to our fundamental liberties. To the extent that such surveillance is currently legal, this is only because the law has not yet caught up with the rapidly growing capabilities of AI. For example, under current law, the government can purchase detailed records of Americans’ movements, web browsing, and associations from public sources without obtaining a warrant, a practice the Intelligence Community has acknowledged raises privacy concerns and that has generated bipartisan opposition in Congress. Powerful AI makes it possible to assemble this scattered, individually innocuous data into a comprehensive picture of any person’s life—automatically and at massive scale.\n\nFully autonomous weapons. Partially autonomous weapons, like those used today in Ukraine, are vital to the defense of democracy. Even fully autonomous weapons (those that take humans out of the loop entirely and automate selecting and engaging targets) may prove critical for our national defense. But today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons. We will not knowingly provide a product that puts America’s warfighters and civilians at risk. We have offered to work directly with the Department of War on R&D to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have not accepted this offer. In addition, without proper oversight, fully autonomous weapons cannot be relied upon to exercise the critical judgment that our highly trained, professional troops exhibit every day. They need to be deployed with proper guardrails, which don’t exist today.\n\nTo our knowledge, these two exceptions have not been a barrier to accelerating the adoption and use of our models within our armed forces to date.\n\nThe Department of War has stated they will only contract with AI companies who accede to “any lawful use” and remove safeguards in the cases mentioned above. They have threatened to remove us from their systems if we maintain these safeguards; they have also threatened to designate us a “supply chain risk”—a label reserved for US adversaries, never before applied to an American company—and to invoke the Defense Production Act to force the safeguards’ removal. These latter two threats are inherently contradictory: one labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.\n\nRegardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.\n\nIt is the Department’s prerogative to select contractors most aligned with their vision. But given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider. Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters—with our two requested safeguards in place. Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.\n\nWe remain ready to continue our work to support the national security of the United States.",

The printing press and broad availability of book reproduction.\n\n\n> you can spend an eternity trying to edit it out -- much like programmers do with vibecoded slop\n\nSure. Or you can have a multi-agentic pipeline, clear PRD's, a TDD agent that verifies correctness to the API contracts you specify, reviewing agents that are tackling things w/fresh context window from the perspective of security, aesthetics, correctness, use CGP (code property graphs) or AST (abstract syntax tree graphs) to give the code actual context on your data flows, and burn $30 on Opus-4.6 in half an hour getting 90% of the way to something that would have taken you 2-4 weeks in the past.\n\nTake that same pattern - AI pipelines w/clear context agents that tune some input to a desired \"bend\" in the distribution on the output, and you don't have slop. The shape of this technology - subjective, aesthetic, weirdly \"good taste / bad taste\" oriented through how models are pre-trained, post-trained, fine-tuned, then prompted, _should_ hold pretty universal in all domains. Sure, you have to burn multiples of compute to get that more refined \"not one-shot slop\" output, but the cost of compute is bottoming out so insanely fast that this is kind of inevitable.",

Those textbooks distill knowledge from many sources, and Anthropic's models benefit from getting to start from a much clearer starting point than if they needed to come to the same conclusions from first principles themselves.\n\nSo there's a fairly strong argument to be made that Anthropic is being hypocritical here, having happily distilled everyone else's knowledge for their own benefit while being up-in-arms about others now doing the same to them. You can believe that *both* Anthropic and these other models are stealing knowledge, or neither are - but its hard to thread the needle between the two behaviors to say one is right and one is wrong IMO.",

It assumes that foreign labs/governments matching US AI capabilities is a bigger concern than the US government having exclusive access to these capabilities.\n\nI think these are both unlikely to be true. If the US govt said \"Give us your model with no safeguards and don't tell anyone, or we will not allow you to do business\", I doubt we would ever hear about it and I doubt Anthropic would end up out of business.\n\nFrankly, this strikes me as a damage control response to stuff the US gov't is pressuring them about behind closed doors.",

It's still and I think with the current models we are using basically a souped up version of auto complete. It's a fancy version of googling \"website code boiler plate\" and a bit of iteration on top of that. I spend less time writing fresh code and more time reviewing what Claude Code spat out and telling it what to adjust or just doing it myself because I know what I'm doing and LLMs fundamentally do not, they just predict what is the most likely code. \n\nI think LLMs can be thought of in terms of being basically an upgrade to internet searches where the text, image, or what not just automatically appears instead of having to copy and paste it. Sure a lot of entry level work involves copy templates and best practices and adjusting it to your brand, case, or set of numbers.  And honestly a lot of that can be done by a LLM because it's standardized. But life is not standardized, hence there will be problems to solve.",

E.g. If you give the wrong drug to that nice old lady, you do get a reward signal, but it’s usually in the form of a death notice and malpractice lawsuit. \n\nFor Swe, we’re operating in a low trust environment by default, and have this developed excellent ability to distinguish between different failure modes and catch them early. There hasnt been sufficient motivation to do this to the same extent in other fields. I think this is the big reason SWE might seem particularily vulnerable.\n",

It's much easier to design a good tool for yourself, so normal that SWE would design tooling that improve their field.\n\nSecond point, coding is about 20-30% of what SWE do, so if they get entirely replaced it mean that much more was automated. Typically what about SWE that work in law/accounting/finance ? What about the software that goes into planes or car ? Will we remove the regulation ?\n\nIf we manage to replace even them we have likely something pretty solid. What I understand for lawyers is that tools that make research much more efficient are deployed and that the AI would dig the reference material so you would double check. But now maybe a research that you do would require half the time as before. And potentially of writing stuff by yourself, the AI would do half the work that you would improve and review.\n\nIn the end replace doesn't make any sense vs improve/help. If you AI make people say twice as productive we will either have more business overall OR we will layoff people that become unnecessary and potentially salaries will drop.\n\nFor accounting honestly I don't get it as for me you can automate everything WITHOUT AI. So I don't think the situation is much different than before.\n\nI don't think AI would decimate (divide by 10) the SWE industry. I would expect a gain that maybe bring us to 2X in productivity at some point and that there will be lot of effort to develop all these product to increase productivity in all other job as it was always our job as SWE. At some point I was doing software for retail. The idea is that when a supermaket did introduce a software like ours for the first time, they would divide by 10 the number of people needed. And there was not any AI in that software, just classical automation.\n\nWhat matter is how many new/different jobs are created. And this you only know after the fact but historically unemployed keep at low value most of the time.\n\nWhat would make you think that time would be different long term ?",

They won't replace accountants, but will allow individual accountants to work on many many more jobs at the same time, greatly reducing demand for total accountants.\n\nAI won't replace the marketing guys responsible for imagining and planning ads, but it will replace the rest of the team that actually takes those ideas and implements them.\n\nBasically, white collar jobs will remain just as much as is necessary to interact with (or manipulate) other humans. Everything else will be AI. Curiously, I'm in tech support, and despite AI being capable of analyzing and troubleshooting problems, I'm fairly secure in my position simply because AI will likely not understand the empathy required to de-escalate and calm down a panicky non-tech savvy person having a mental breakdown because their internet is down.",

I can’t imagine firms maintaining the level of legal staff with the ease of research. The moment LLMs convince the major firms of their data safety, mass layoffs will follow.",
