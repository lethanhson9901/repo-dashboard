Don't antropomorphize it.\n\nWhat you're seeing is probably the self-correction training kicking in. The model slipped (maybe due to the sampling, maybe due to any other reason) into writing \"dark/light mode toggle\" as a list item, and since it can't undo the writing, but the previous context also shows you had decided on \"light,\" and since the model can't really delete what's already been output, it makes sense to complete with something that invalidates that item.",

I feel like I manage a lot of the context by hand because intuitively I know what it needs to see in order to have the best results for my work. However, that intuition of knowing what to pay attention to and what to prioritize…that’s not always right for me either as a human. \n\nThis problem vexes me and makes me wonder if it lies outside of physical possibility given the drastic combinatorial explosion that exists within reality. We’ve struggled with underspecification and the qualification problem and combinatorial explosion for a very long time, and I’m somewhat confident it’s something we cannot solve but rather navigate. For certain types of problems we take certain approaches more often or even commonly. A lot of times, networks reinforced in game environments will find similar speedrun glitches and solutions as actual human players to problems to maximize for reward. \n\nI think what we have in artificial intelligence is a lack of freedom of will. So…networks that can prioritize potential solutions, have data representative of the actual nature of the problem (this part is hard because even we are limited by our human perception which is trippy to think about). \n\nI think if we want more powerful AI then we’re going to have to start making more effective environments which is the opposite thing you want for your weird little digital slave god when you’re a money grubbing billionaire.",

It’s easily the fastest terminal agent I’ve used for refactors, but the one thing driving me crazy was the total lack of visibility. When an agent takes 40 seconds to finish a turn or starts looping on a shell command, I want to know exactly where the bottleneck is—not just wait for the final output.\n\nI spent the weekend digging into how to actually trace these sessions. Unlike other tools, Claude Code is a bit of a \"post-hoc\" system. It doesn't give you real-time event streams out of the box, but it writes every single detail—thinking blocks, tool calls, and exact token usage—into JSONL transcript files on your disk at `~/.claude/projects/{project}/sessions/{session}.jsonl`.\n\nTo get this into a readable trace, you have to use the `Stop` hook in your `~/.claude/settings.json`. The trick is that this hook fires right after the turn ends, allowing you to run a script that parses the latest transcript and reconstructs the entire hierarchical span.\n\nThe cool part about Claude Code's model is that it exposes token data that Cursor doesn't. You can see the exact breakdown of prompt tokens vs. cache creation vs. completion tokens. It’s the only way I’ve found to actually track what a session is costing in real-time.\n\nMy config looks like this now:\n\nJSON\n\n    {\n      \"hooks\": {\n        \"Stop\": [\n          {\n            \"hooks\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"command\",\n                \"command\": \"python ~/.claude/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nNow, instead of just a terminal output, I get a full trace tree that looks like this:\n\n* **claude\\_session\\_xyz** (32.4s)\n   * ├── **Thinking** (1.2s) - \"Analyzing the dependency graph...\"\n   * ├── **Tool: list\\_files** (0.4s)\n   * ├── **Thinking** (0.8s) - \"I need to check the test suite.\"\n   * └── **Shell: npm test** (5.1s)\n\nIt makes debugging agent failures a lot less like guesswork. If anyone wants the specific Python logic for parsing the JSONL transcripts and pushing them to an API, see my full docs in comments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hs5astt64edg1.png?width=2287&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fb8d16ad2cd5bf79033cc0890f52ad0e7413cb0\n\n",

Months of documentation, research, and correspondence with doctors are now locked behind a ban I can’t appeal because the only responses I get are from bots.\n\nMy best guess for why I was flagged? I’m a long-term guest at a Marriott hotel. I’ve been here for weeks dealing with a medical crisis, using their shared Wi-Fi. I suspect their automated system saw multiple users on the same IP address and flagged it as suspicious activity. I’m not running a bot farm. I’m a sick woman in a hotel room trying to survive.\nI’ve now sent five emails requesting help. Every single response has been automated. Copy-pasted links to the same forms I’ve already filled out.\n\nThe best part? One of the bots - “Fin AI Agent” - asked me: “Would you like me to connect you with a human agent?” I said yes. I then received two more automated responses. No human ever materialized.\n\nSo Anthropic has charged me for a service they simultaneously banned me from using, refused to issue a refund, provided no human support despite explicitly offering it, and left me with no way to access months of medical documentation I created using their product.\n\nAnyone else experience this? Is there actually a human being who works in support at this company, or is it bots all the way down? Is there any chance this can actually be resolved or am I gonna have to cancel the card so I don’t get charged indefinitely for a product that I can’t use? \n\nI’ve submitted multiple appeals and sent multiple emails. \n\n\nPlease help me.

Giving models file access, connecting Drive, stitching tools together, and calling that “agents.”\n\nClaude has now shipped this as a first-class product feature.\n\nClaude Cowork is a task execution mode in the Claude Desktop app. Instead of responding to prompts, it works toward an outcome.\n\nYou describe an outcome. Claude plans the steps, works across local files you explicitly share, and executes multi-step tasks with minimal back & forth. Context stays alive until the task finishes as you review plans and approve risky actions.\n\nWhat stood out to me:\n\n* Local execution on macOS inside an isolated VM\n* Explicit folder-level permissions\n* Designed for long-running multi-step work.\n* Still a research preview with sharp limits. (MacOS only, higher usage, no persistence)\n\nI went into how the architecture actually works, including planning, sub-agent coordination, file access, and safety boundaries.

Actually,\n\n* Make a new folder, maybe called \"Claude Workspace\"\n* Copy files into it (do not move them)\n* Think about it as a playground where mistakes are okay\n\nPeople usually forget to make backups. But if asked to intentionally copy files to a new folder, easy-peacy! People will do it\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/cant-wait-to-try-claude-cowork-dont-let-it-accidentally-v0-6yfzbxzktsdg1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a3ad89ed5799352120a3c2a6f95db688de70c8c)\n\n[Try to create a seperate folder where mistakes are okay](https://preview.redd.it/u05upqz5usdg1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89255cc12823dc6f50ec949fea7571c802808a2)\n\n# Method 2: Be Very Specific\n\n**Being polite with AI can be dangerous.**\n\n❌ Bad: \"Could you organize these files?\"\n\n✅ Good: \"Sort these 47 PDFs by date. DO NOT delete anything. Make folders named by year.\"\n\nWhen you are more specific, Claude Cowork does not need to guess, and **guessing is where problems happen.**\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/cant-wait-to-try-claude-cowork-dont-let-it-accidentally-v0-la0k8nontsdg1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=6470035b81b1aacb29c230acfc8b3fc575a0b8d5)\n\n[Being specific on your prompt is helpful](https://preview.redd.it/ucrxa618usdg1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=364ec963593bc1e5fb6378fbd3532c3c5fe737b3)\n\n# Method 3: Check Before You Approve\n\nWhen Claude Cowork wants to delete/move/rename something:\n\n* Wait 2 seconds\n* Ask: \"Do I understand WHY Claude wants to do this?\"\n* No? Refuse and do it yourself\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/cant-wait-to-try-claude-cowork-dont-let-it-accidentally-v0-pqwscvyptsdg1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=57beebbd3b7dbf28d7ecfce65ace0ba95ef7a5a6)\n\nBe cautious on what Claude Cowork is about to do before you choose\n\n[Be cautious on what Claude Cowork is about to do before you choose](https://preview.redd.it/zo3w5hw9usdg1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=565137508b119fe349c5817b8ef02e78a3e87013)\n\n# A Simple Smart-Intern Mindset \n\nClaude Cowork is fast & useful for people. But like driving a fast car, you want to drive it carefully. \n\nGood news is all these protections are basically just asking you to think a bit differently:\n\n**Think of Claude Cowork as a smart intern who understands words literally, and has the key to your office.**\n\n**You would not tell an intern \"figure out my files by yourself.\" Same thing here.**",

I was excited when Anthropic announced the capability to\ngenerate files like .pptx and have spent soooo much time trying to get Claude to create a PPT\nfrom scratch. After several attempts, I’ve gotten stuck.\n\nThe content itself is fine, but the slide structure is off. Plus small changes require regenerating\nbig chunks. The resulting file requires so much manual cleanup that it’d probably be faster to do\nthe whole thing manually. I’m not saying the feature is useless, I just haven’t been able to figure out how to make it work properly.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?",

Just because Claude can generate a .pptx file doesn't mean it knows how to make a well-designed slide deck. After trying and failing like you did, I finally gave up and had to change my approach. I now use Claude for refining content then hand that off to Gamma for generating the presentation itself. Then export that as a .pptx file to share with clients.",

No recollection.\n\n\"What about the guidelines\"? No idea what I'm talking about.\n\nLooked a bit deeper, turns out. Theoretically:\n\nWhen nearing context capacity, Opus is supposed to summarize/compress parts of the conversation to self-manage context size to allow longer conversations.  \n  \nGenius idea.  \n  \nMakes complete sense and I think I recall they published that users will be notified when this happens.\n\nBeautiful idea with excellent user experience.\n\nTheoretically.\n\nReality:\n\nThe entire start of the conversation is dropped.  \n  \nNo summary.\n\nNo compressed version.\n\nNo tool for it to fetch relevant data.\n\nJust a complete fresh conversation, starting from halfway through the chat.\n\ncontinue long enough, it'll truncate again to a later point in the conversation.\n\nWhen does this happen? You can’t tell. No indication is displayed once the context window slides.\n\nTry \"output the first words of this conversation\" in a long chat to find where your conversation \\*actually\\* starts.\n\nAll your back and forth, including artifacts, attachments from before that checkpoint are removed from the context with opus having no access or knowledge about them.\n\nWorkarounds?\n\nAFAIK - none.\n\nNo toggle or setting to enable/disable this \"dynamic context\" behavior.\n\nEnabling chat history search may solve this, but then you're burning/convoluting context window tokens with history search results.\n\nAnd even then, \\*Opus itself doesn't know\\* that the start of the chat has been truncated so it doesn't know if or when it might need information from earlier non-existent-now parts of the chat.\n\nMy best attempt at handling this is asking for the response with start with the first 5 words of the chat, followed by the actual response.\n\nThis might be redundant if the window slides mid response, but at least it gives some certainty.\n\nIf anyone from Anthropic is reading this, please at the very least indicate \\*when\\* the context window slides. \n\nIt's frustrating to provide context, build up momentum - just to have Opus become a generic token completion model at unknown points down the road.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cov48t95rgeg1.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f405659f98bd1533f102685b0365a7cf247bbdd\n\n",

When the status bar tells you you’re nearing “0%”, you’re really nearing 75% full. \n- Once you get past 75% or so with your current agent, tell it to generate a machine-readable handoff document for the next instance. \n- Use “/exit” or “/clear”\n- Tell the new instance to use the handoff doc and keep going.  \n\nThat’s it.
