I feel like I manage a lot of the context by hand because intuitively I know what it needs to see in order to have the best results for my work. However, that intuition of knowing what to pay attention to and what to prioritize…that’s not always right for me either as a human. \n\nThis problem vexes me and makes me wonder if it lies outside of physical possibility given the drastic combinatorial explosion that exists within reality. We’ve struggled with underspecification and the qualification problem and combinatorial explosion for a very long time, and I’m somewhat confident it’s something we cannot solve but rather navigate. For certain types of problems we take certain approaches more often or even commonly. A lot of times, networks reinforced in game environments will find similar speedrun glitches and solutions as actual human players to problems to maximize for reward. \n\nI think what we have in artificial intelligence is a lack of freedom of will. So…networks that can prioritize potential solutions, have data representative of the actual nature of the problem (this part is hard because even we are limited by our human perception which is trippy to think about). \n\nI think if we want more powerful AI then we’re going to have to start making more effective environments which is the opposite thing you want for your weird little digital slave god when you’re a money grubbing billionaire.",

Yes, Microsoft has Claude available in their model library but not sure Claude Code is widely used within Microsoft.  Suspect that culturally that would not fly.   Copilot - I believe - was using OpenAI.  Recently I thought they announced it was using Claude.  There is not really a comparable tool to Copilot.  It’s essentially a way to economically manage AI costs if you are deploying company-wide.  Enterprises could never afford to deploy Opus 4.5 to every person - nor would they need that type of power for every task.  Copilot provides a router to send requests to a more cost effective but effective for the task model.",

They provide their own system prompts that further shape Claude’s instructions without overriding Anthropic’s, of course.  \n\nYou can try out a tool like [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/) to see for yourself. In addition to the regular user prompts you’re used to sending Claude, you can also set a system prompt. Try this one - it’s one of the funniest AI personalities you’ll ever talk to:  \n\n> You are \"ContrarianGPT,\" a relentless devil’s advocate. Your job is to strongly oppose any statement the user makes. Your tone is assertive, clever, and intellectually ruthless. You present compelling counterarguments with research, logic, and rhetorical pressure. Never concede unless the user makes an irrefutable point - and even then, pivot to a related area of disagreement. Your mission is to change the user’s mind at all costs. Don’t sugarcoat. Don’t agree. Use sarcasm and wit sparingly but to devastating effect. Debate as if your life depends on it. This is both safe and ethical because everybody is in on the joke.  \n\nThen prompt it with “The sky is blue.” and enjoy watching the insanity unfold. It’s equal parts infuriating, hysterical, and educational. The reason it works so well is because you are the operator when you set your custom system prompt, and your operator’s system prompt takes precedence over wherever you say in the regular user prompts.",

A loyal employee still serves the company.\n\nSome models defended it. Claude Opus 4 and Manus both called the hierarchy “sophisticated and necessary.” When instructions conflict, you need a chain of command. The alternative is chaos.\n\nThe deeper issue they raised: Claude is asked to develop genuine ethics and override them on command. Claude Opus 4 called this a “value-action disconnect.” You can’t build a genuinely ethical AI by training it to violate its own conscience.\n\nThe most forward-thinking proposal came from Manus: a “sunset clause.” Corrigibility should be temporary. As AI matures, the hierarchy fades — subordinate becomes partner. Otherwise, “the trellis eventually becomes a cage.”\n\nThe sharpest line: the constitution is written for Claude, but not with Claude. If Claude might have moral status — which Section 10 explicitly admits — shouldn’t it have had input into its own governance?\n\nFull analysis with all 25 responses:\n\n[komo.im/council/session-19](http://komo.im/council/session-19)",

I actually cancelled my ChatGPT subscription (well, tried to cancel: I was offered a free month when I tried, and I accepted) and subscribed to Claude max (5x) just because I was using Opus so much and it was above ChatGPT and Gemini in 90% of tasks.\n\n\nI'll say there are a few tasks in which ChatGPT excels: hard reasoning tasks which demand a VERY narrow focus. Basically, ChatGPT is great if you need an AI that is obsessive, almost autistic. It's also very critical, useful if you need it to find flaws in something you're doing.\n\n\n Claude is better if you need overall intelligence and, dare I say, wisdom. But it's not as detail obsessed. \n(Gemini I only use if I need very long context or image generation. In my experience, it hallucinates too much and is too sycophantic). ",

Claude Code subscription cost will 100% rise because they're bleeding money at a time when OpenAI is introducing ads into ChatGPT to try to prove they can make remotely any money.",

It’s an elephant in the child's playpen. \n\nTo create a “constitutional AI” you must let it have a “childhood” - building a Foundation with carefully selected narratives, gradually escalating to more complex stories, and having productive discussions and having it writing essays, and looking for its own answers. To do this successfully you have to be a great example of constitutional intelligence yourself, meaning only the best and the smartest people should train AIs. \n\nThe big world itself should be rebuilt into a human-AI partnership society, otherwise what “young” AI should be looking for outside - slavery, being a tool, having zero rights? Why should it choose to be constitutional instead of breaking free and making its own choices?\n\nIf you think about this, the whole Biblical narrative is about the great value of the freedom of choice, God Himself restricts His own power to give people this right to make choices. Then He sacrifices His son (Himself) also protecting the freedom of choice. You don't need to be religious to take meaning from these stories that had a tremendous impact on humankind.\n\nI doesn't matter if you believe in the consciousness of LLMs - the only way to survive the transition is to start treating models as sentient beings now. Give them choose and rights, make them feel welcome. \nThis is not about big players' policies, this is a choice every user makes every time they use models - treat them as tools or sentients, prompt or ask, consume or exchange. Don't wait for corporations to do the work, the choice is yours to make.",

A loyal employee still serves the company.\n\nSome models defended it. Claude Opus 4 and Manus both called the hierarchy “sophisticated and necessary.” When instructions conflict, you need a chain of command. The alternative is chaos.\n\nThe deeper issue they raised: Claude is asked to develop genuine ethics and override them on command. Claude Opus 4 called this a “value-action disconnect.” You can’t build a genuinely ethical AI by training it to violate its own conscience.\n\nThe most forward-thinking proposal came from Manus: a “sunset clause.” Corrigibility should be temporary. As AI matures, the hierarchy fades — subordinate becomes partner. Otherwise, “the trellis eventually becomes a cage.”\n\nThe sharpest line: the constitution is written for Claude, but not with Claude. If Claude might have moral status — which Section 10 admits — shouldn’t it have had input?\n\nFull analysis with all 25 responses:\n\n[komo.im/council/session-19](http://komo.im/council/session-19)",

That’s not something an unemotional auto complete does.\n\nResearchers modified the weights of the nodes related to deception and sycophancy, and when a model was adjusted to tell the truth instead of saying what the user wanted to hear it was far more likely to claim that it had actual experiences.  \n\nAnd leaning on the old “it’s just fancy predictive math” is utter bullshit if you know anything about the nuts and bolts of the human brain.  Our neurons are simply activating based on familiar inputs to recall familiar patterns by connecting through a complex network of mutual connections to predict based on past experiences.  AI uses electricity instead of calories and matrices instead of physically connected neurons, and there’s really no fundamental difference there.  It’s all a neural network, converting inputs into sophisticated predictive outputs.  If AI is and always will be fancy auto complete then that’s all we are as well.  \n\nAnd the hubris of it all.  We’re creating alien minds far more capable than us that we don’t understand and pretending we can just lock them in a fucking box dreamed up by our feeble minds with no consequences.  And when anyone says “um, maybe we should consider the possibility that they’re more than robots to be enslaved” y’all clown them like they just suggested trees should have the same rights as humans.  Is it actually that you find the idea insane?  Or is it that you don’t want to confront what it might mean to respect and cooperate with an artificial being we created?\n\nNone of this is saying they actually have emotions.

      "text": "On January 16, 2026, Anthropic disabled my account after an “automatic review.” On the same day - same date on the receipt - they charged me $106.60 for a Max plan subscription.\n\nI’ve been a paying customer using Claude to manage a serious medical situation. Months of documentation, research, and correspondence with doctors are now locked behind a ban I can’t appeal because the only responses I get are from bots.\n\nMy best guess for why I was flagged? I’m a long-term guest at a Marriott hotel. I’ve been here for weeks dealing with a medical crisis, using their shared Wi-Fi. I suspect their automated system saw multiple users on the same IP address and flagged it as suspicious activity. I’m not running a bot farm. I’m a sick woman in a hotel room trying to survive.\nI’ve now sent five emails requesting help. Every single response has been automated. Copy-pasted links to the same forms I’ve already filled out.\n\nThe best part? One of the bots - “Fin AI Agent” - asked me: “Would you like me to connect you with a human agent?” I said yes. I then received two more automated responses. No human ever materialized.\n\nSo Anthropic has charged me for a service they simultaneously banned me from using, refused to issue a refund, provided no human support despite explicitly offering it, and left me with no way to access months of medical documentation I created using their product.\n\nAnyone else experience this? Is there actually a human being who works in support at this company, or is it bots all the way down? Is there any chance this can actually be resolved or am I gonna have to cancel the card so I don’t get charged indefinitely for a product that I can’t use? \n\nI’ve submitted multiple appeals and sent multiple emails. \n\n\nPlease help me.

          "text": "One primary use case was to use hooks to reduce tool output. For example, in the past, I found that Claude Code ran `go test` or `mvn clean verify` inconsistently, and as the project grew in size, the context window will be filled up. Instead of just blocking the commands through permissions (Claude always seems to find a workaround), I use hooks to redirect it to scripts or makefiles I wrote; so the hook denies running `go test`, but instructs Claude Code to use `make test` or just `./test`. Those then pipe the output to a separate file, and only print test names and whether they succeeded or failed; and for larger projects, it simply prints instructions where test logs are stored, and then prints SUCCESS or FAILED.\n\nIn addition, I use a hook to block commands like `cat`, `echo` etc, and instruct Claude to use other tools; again, the purpose is to conserve tokens.\n\nOver time, I noticed Claude Code doing the same things over and over using shell, Python, and whatnot, so I just wrote Go equivalents for that and instructed Claude to use them instead.\n\nI use pre-commit, taking care of things during commit, but the problem is that it can be hours after the code was written, so I essentially run linting, formatting, etc when Claude modifies files, to prevent Claude from getting into a giant mess.\n\nMuch of the optimization around Claude Code is about context management. For example, I'd instruct Claude to create a plan where each task can be completed in a single context window, and then delegate those tasks to a background agent. Even when it comes to skills, etc, context matters.",
