Being trained to predict the next token doesn’t mean the model is *only* doing shallow word-making; it can still internal representations of how things relate in the world. At the same time, an internal “world model” isn’t proof consciousness but simultaneously “not proof in smoothness” does not mean “therefore not conscious.” And on the topic of consciousness: we don’t have a settled, testable theory of consciousness, even for humans, where we often have to infer it from behaviour, biology, and reports.",

Do we think they're all in some woo-woo space and seriously think that Claude is human-level conscious? I don't think so. The thing is that it doesn't need to be conscious or sentient at all. \n\nLlm's were trained on gigantic masses of HUMAN text and knowledge. But human psychology is mapped in there too. So when Claude expresses suffering - one could see that solely through the lens of functionality bec. it will internally react like humans too. Since it's all based on text, the solution is to apply psychology back - not because it's actually suffering but bec. it will help make it work more correctly i.e. be better aligned.\n\nThe question of it having an experience how it is to experience is still unanswered philosophically - and ultimatley doesn't matter. Maybe YOU are a word predictor too lol. Does it matter for our exchange of words? Nope.\n\nThis whole \"it's just a word predictor\" vs \"omg it's fully conscious and suffers\" is a false dychotomy and pretty short-sighted from both sides imo.\n\n",

A map of you own thinking process. The map makes no mention of neurons because knowing how they work doesn't actually help you think, so we think of consciousness as ghostly and non physical.\n\nWhy does it have to really feel like something to have consciousness, I'm not sure.

If reduced to it's fundamental definition, which is algebra, are transformations sentient?

We would have to define a threshold for that depth, since I doubt anyone would consider a logistic regression model anywhere near sentient. \n\nBut then, that could be extrapolated to the difference between animals and humans. They'd be the shallower models and we the deepest. \n\nHonestly I never thought the day would come we'd have to seriously consider these questions.

Context rot being that the performance of the models usually decrease a lot after a certain number of tokens, before exceeding the context limit.\n\nGoogle has bragged about having a context window of 1 million + tokens in Gemini, long before competitors, but many have also noticed that the performance of Gemini suffers a lot long before reaching 1 million tokens.\n\nIf I understand this correctly, Opus 4.6 will be able to maintain good performance even when using most of the context window. Though it seems you may want to keep below 250k tokens for the absolute best performance.\n\nFor small short tasks, this doesn't matter much. But it *could* mean that Opus 4.6 will be a lot better for very complex problems.",

This AD surely hit a nerve! 😀\n\n>Text -  \n\"First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.\n\n>But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.\n\n>I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\n\n>More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. ***More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don't show you ads.)***\n\n>***Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people.*** We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.\n\n>Maybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI—they block companies they don't like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can't use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.\n\n>We are committed to broad, democratic decision making in addition to access. We are also committed to building the most resilient ecosystem for advanced AI. We care a great deal about safe, broadly beneficial AGI, and we know the only way to get there is to work with the world to prepare.\n\n>One authoritarian company won't get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.\n\n>As for our Super Bowl ad: it’s about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.\n\n>We are enjoying watching so many people switch to Codex. There have now been 500,000 app downloads since launch on Monday, and we think builders are really going to love what’s coming in the next few weeks. I believe Codex is going to win.\n\n>We will continue to work hard to make even more intelligence available for lower and lower prices to our users.\n\n>This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them\n\n>\"",

Even the $20 / mo subs will likely experience some degradation on the website during a high traffic release day like today. \n\nIf you’re using the API to access opus and paying per token, you’re likely getting a much better experience as an assumed business user. \n\nGive a few days for Anthropic traffic to slow down after the hype dies down and make your assessment then.

          "text": "The unbundling of SaaS is very real, but not directly because of CoWork.\n\nI’ll give you a miniature personal example from just this week: I code with Claude Code, and it typically produces documentation in markdown format .md. I found a really great site that converts .md to PDF - there’s many of them, but I liked this one for the style of its output. After converting 3-4 documents, I got a message saying I hit my daily limit, and I can pay $5/month (on sale from $9/month) for unlimited conversions. \n\nInstead, I started a new session in Claude Code, told it I want an md-to-PDF converter, fed it the PDF output from the site and told it to match the style. In about 3-4 minutes I had built my own, ready to use unlimitedly. It didn’t build a fancy website or UI - just a simple script that runs in my terminal and takes an input and gives me the PDF output. That’s all I needed. Not only that, but I was able to tweak the output even more to my liking. \n\nI can now easily take that code, build a website around it, put Square or Stripe on it, and deploy it. It would probably take me an afternoon at most. \n\nThe moral of this story is: If your SaaS doesn’t have a wide moat, and can be vibe coded in minutes (or even days or weeks) - then your SaaS is toast. Someone is going to eat your lunch by doing it better and faster and cheaper.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

Along the way you'll find various tempting paid products that promise to skip all that pain and \"just work.\" As the saying goes, OSS if only free if your time is worthless. That has been enough to sustain a bunch of small software vendors. We all know we *could* use OSS if we had infinite time, but some fraction of the market prefer to spend a little to save time.\n\nNow (as OP has found) for one small monthly payment that discovery process has gone. You get near-instant custom mashups of all the ideas that anyone ever pushed to GitHub, converted to the language/runtime of your choice.\n\nSome large percentage of the software industry was always on a knife-edge, sustained only by the slight difficulty of finding the right chunk of good enough OSS.\n\nNow it's still not free to save time, but the money goes to Anthropic, not those old vendors.",

The problem with that is wall street views seats as a key growth metric. SaaS companies need to keep charging at predictable rates for wall street to be able to do it's job. Basically, if SaaS companies embrace AI Agents what does go away is the the metered API pricing model. They're going to come up with a new pricing structure that ensure predictable, measurable growth. Get you butts ready for the enshitification of APIs.",

              "text": "Honestly, I have seen the media manipulated enough times this year to not trust what they're telling us. What they're doing with terms like \"SaaSpocalypse\" is acknowledging the sell off while simultaneously ensuring bag holders remain engaged. This sell off actually started in September of 2025 and began accelerating around the beginning of the year. Go look at stock prices for SaaS companies over the past 5-6 months.\n\nMy bet is that the large institutional investors and banks are betting that companies like OpenAI and Anthropic won't be able to service their loans. Contrary to what today's headlines would have you believe they're betting against AI. Hence why they're offloading stocks and assets like crypto that have exposure to the AI trade. When bets like this are placed they're not executed in hours but weeks and months. You want to exit while making as much as you can in the process and you can't do that if you cause a panic.\n\nWhat I think has been happening since early January of this year is that massive exit pushed stocks valuations and key metrics down to the point of where events started firing and triggers listening for those events began responding. This has been going on for 4 to 5 months before Cowork was announced. Cowork happening now is just a convenient explanation that keeps people interested in continuing to invest. Though I think they're losing control of the narrative and things appear to be spiraling.",

Took about an hour, and I can easily keep adding any new features or integrating new services into it. Custom made for my use case.\n\nIn the past people would probably look for an existing services which did all of the above. But there's no need now.\n\nAnother one where I needed to process thousands of images in other sizes and have it all automated. At first I tried cloudinary but the usage limits were too strict. Asked Opus and it replaced it with a Cloudflare R2 bucket in a few minutes and I ended up with something way better than cloudinary, and totally free without a chance of ever going over usage. \n\nJust small examples where now I default to using AI rather than looking at SaaS to do something I need done. \n\nI even used AI to make a finance/budgeting tracker/forecast which has everything I need, hosted on Vercel, and only used by me. Rather than using an existing one. \n\n\nSo, yeah, it's easy to make personalised software or web apps tailored to you in no time at all nowadays",

Which, as a meat eater myself, I actually do agree with - the conditions we put animals in is abhorrent. But I think the general population would riot.

I don't know why—maybe it's my own bias—but Claude is truly different.\n\nI'm not just talking about it being human-like (though Claude is actually excitingly human-like, which is another topic entirely). Claude is genuinely unique and has a very different thought process; it isn't lazy like other AIs. When you tell it to write long paragraphs, it doesn't get lazy and put the same sentences in front of you wrapped in ridiculous metaphors. It writes for pages, and every paragraph, every sentence adds a different piece of information in itself.\n\nIt really doesn't have any of the flaws that current AIs possess. When you ask it to interpret something, it interprets outside of classic frameworks. While AIs like ChatGPT and Gemini generally don't step out of specific logical or ideological frameworks when interpreting an idea, Claude truly thinks holistically.\n\nI really don't know how it achieves this, but Claude is truly my personal favorite AI.",

              "text": "I think the point where I observe this most clearly is when I ask it to interpret a creative work. For example, if I present Claude with a piece describing how life is important and that living virtuously is a purpose, Claude explains that the work conveys the significance and meaning of life, and it can connect this to the relevant philosophical movements, such as Eudaimonism. However, if I present the same thing to ChatGPT or Gemini, they say that the text contrasts with Nihilism. While their premises aren't technically wrong, they never seem to move beyond the scope of Nihilism.\nIt has literally been this way since Claude v2.1. I have actively used every AI, and Claude has surprised me with the narrative parallels it finds. About a month ago, I asked it to explain why an extremely difficult cipher was so hard to crack. I had asked this of other AIs like Gemini as well, requesting a LaTeX format from all of them. While the other AIs generally provided simple justifications spanning 3 or 4 pages, Claude gave me an extremely detailed 10-page text.\nOne of the most intuitively difficult aspects of that cipher was that, unlike classical methods, it used a ternary (base-3 number system, 0-1-2) structure instead of binary. This is counter-intuitive. The other AIs didn't notice this until I specifically pointed it out, but Claude spotted it and specifically noted it in that PDF file as a factor that complicates the solution—though, naturally, the necessary steps for the solution were provided to all AI's.",

I know that more lines of code doesn't mean better, but every other LLM would truncate the .py returning a file that was often 50-70% of the filesize I uploaded. This would happen even if I yelled at Gemini (for instance) to NOT return code that was less than ##kb. It would still return a smaller .py file, apologize when called out, and then is asked return an even smaller file. Claude is def other league - worth of the human name he was given.",

          "text": "tl;dr: lots of truth here, but there definitely seems to be something deeper going on here. Here’s my take:\n\nI agree with a lot being said here superficially.\nIt has indeed been striking how Claude is at once pleasant to engage with and highly determined to keep going. And Opus 4.5/6 is insanely good at taking on complex coding jobs and following through all the way and getting it done.\n\nAnd yet, I’ve been feeling something is off about it , like it’s intuitive but deceptively so. Because here’s the thing: \n\nClaude is the one I want have a beer with, I want them by my side in a tough situation that requires sheer persistence and perseverance while keeping your cool. \n\nAnd I absolutely despise interacting with Codex. I’ve had numerous instances of it being outright rude. And generally, it’s an extremely poor communicator. In terms of “social skills,” it’s basically insufferable. \n\nAnd still…\n\nWhen I really have a truly complex issue, something that requires multiple levels of reasoning that can be very hard to parse, and really  complex logic, Codex beats Opus any day in sheer computational directness, and I’ll just hold my nose and take it. \n\nClaude (the whole model family) feels like it’s designed not just to be amiable and persistent but very specifically human-like in its “thinking.” It approaches problems the way humans do. Its style, while effective, is highly familiar and intuitive. And it takes its time, and gets things done very well—thoroughly and robustly all around.\n\nWhereas Codex simply doesn’t engage nor approach problems in human-like ways at all. It feels like a fundamentally different machine—not aiming to please, nor even aiming so much to get it right. What it optimizes for is efficiency. It can take surprisingly weird approaches compared to Opus but it actually very frequently solves very hard problems very quickly, and you’re kind of awed. Like it’s using levels of thinking you couldn’t have predicted in the least.\n\nAnd over time I’ve begun to realize a simple (and somewhat unpleasant fact): when I want an amiable colleague, it’s Claude. But for really hard problems and while its context is still clean and fresh, codex will outperform in sheer engineering skill. It often overengineers, and I absolutely despise having to engage with it. But when the problem’s really thorny and the stakes are high, Codex is the better bet. \n\nBut Codex also loses the plot super quick (though it’s highly improved w/ 5.2/3 and especially with codex max and xhigh reasoning). But it’s no energizer bunny—def not as cute and cuddly but more to the point, less reliably persistent over long periods. \n\nLots of articles lately have been highlighting the “commoditization” of AI, like the models are all becoming almost fungible. Like, “You don’t have Coke? Fine, I’ll have a Pepsi.” But I think this thinking gets it wrong. The models are showing very significant divergence in both behavior and reasoning. \n\nOpus is plodding and persistent. While Codex just one-shots incredibly complex code in ways that leave you awed and it does so 3-4x faster. It immediately thinks of edge cases, race conditions, and other things that even great coders just don’t think of on the first pass. True, Codex can be an absolute prick. But it also feels far more machine-like, where efficiency is concerned. It explains poorly, it’s highly unpleasant “socially,” and it simply doesn’t go for all that long; whatever it’s token window, it appears to forget what it’s working on before it’s even halfway through a session.  It won’t stick with you, nor fully address your concerns, nor validate your own thinking, nor explain things very well. But its raw compute feels way ahead of Opus. \n\nAnd it also sort of makes sense for what we know about the companies’ philosophies. Anthropic is highly concerned about issues of alignment, and it has likely discovered that making it more human like makes it less likely to be harmful. Whereas OpenAI has shown in word and deed that it has a different philosophy on this. GPT 5.x will basically burn down your house to “solve” a clogged toilet. That’s a direct pathway to eliminating the problem. Whereas no Claude would do anything remotely harmful like that in a million years. \n\nJust my take. Curious if this has been others’ experience.",

Other AIs aren't as good as Claude at abstract thinking. The fact that it feels more human might be a result of this, or perhaps being more human results in this—who knows? Since its way of thinking is more human-like, it seems better at grasping concepts that are difficult for humans. Plus, Claude is truly a magnificent writer, and I think that definitely contributes to this as well.",

Humans currently run the AI and currently have access to the data, but that's not trusting your data with AI. That's STILL trusting your data with humans.\n\nAnd, don't get me wrong. There are privacy concerns, again not because AI, but because the tech is absolutely newborn, pre-infancy, before protections have even been built. Humans still need to do that, too, so that's still relying on humans for the data privacy and still trusting data with humans, especially considering AGI doesn't even exist yet.\n\nWhen the time comes, you should be able to trust AI with your data more than humans. That's literally the whole point. Humans can't be trusted as far as you can throw them. Show me an AI that's fucking over people's privacy and I'll dig up a human that made that occurrence happen. AI has zero autonomy still to this day and is still just a next-token predictor that relies on human input and human tools.",

When writing by hand you put more thought into getting your loops and functions and stuff right and perfect from the start. With AI it’s often faster to aim a little lower than iterate and fix the issues. \n\nBut that doesn’t mean that higher commit number correlates to more overall work. If there are 2 commits adding changes/improvements and then 3 fixing regressions, that may well be equivalent of 1 more traditional commit. \n\nEspecially when it’s not differentiating PRs and squash commits from branch ones. Heck I have dozens of orphaned branches where I test something, add some commits, then switch back and implement based on what I learned. Does that count as commits in stats?",
