Now you can import your memories and context in one click.\n\nAnthropic provides a single premade prompt that instructs your model to dump all important context needed for the transition, organised by date/time. You then simply click \"Add to memory\".\n\nThis is huge. Anthropic already dominated the enterprise market, and after recent events and reaching #1 on the iOS App Store, they're now positioned to take the consumer market too.\n\nMeanwhile OpenAI has treated customers like garbage for well over a year, with a contemptuous smile and fake promises: offering no meaningful quality-of-life updates, removing contracted parts of your subscription with little to no notice, and now betraying their promise of intelligence for the benefit of humanity while actively facilitating government agencies to spy on civilians and operate autonomous killing machines using their models.\n\nMake the move. Now. Start putting your money where it's being used right. They've given you the tooling to do so.\n\nNo more excuses.\n\nTo those calling me a bot account or a Claude shill: you can shut up now. I still haven't subscribed to Claude. Are you that blind? I just can't stand Sam Altman and OpenAI's hypocritical, fraudulent, and inhumane practices.",

If the DoD labels Anthropic a 'supply chain risk' a lot of other companies are going to end up using lesser models (as well as deal with an off-boarding process that won't be pretty.) I can't imagine that'll go over well with the defense industry. Additionally we'd have a situation where an American company is given this designation for no real reason. That alone could chill the whole tech ecosystem in not positive ways. I'm not saying the Trump Admin wouldn't do it, but it would be incredibly stupid if they did. As for using war powers to compel access, well, lawsuit city and my guess is the Government would lose. It'd be a stupid battle to fight as it'd defang that threat when they want to use it in the future. If I had to guess, Hegseth will try to make good TV out of cancelling the contract, but leave it at that. The other options just don't work out for them. That said, I don't take the current administration as particularly strategic or thoughtful, so they could do the dumbest possible thing and try to call it a win. ",

      "text": "TL;DR: The Pentagon blacklisted Anthropic for refusing to remove bans on mass surveillance and autonomous weapons. The same day, OpenAI signed a Pentagon deal keeping those same bans. OpenAI's top two executives gave $26M+ to Trump-aligned political vehicles. Anthropic gave $0. The supply chain risk label used against Anthropic has never been applied to an American company before. A bipartisan group of senators called it out. The policy dispute was a pretext. The money trail and timing tell the real story. All sources linked below.\n\n\nOn Friday February 27, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth designated Anthropic a \"supply chain risk to national security\" and President Trump ordered every federal agency to stop using the company's technology. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hegseth-declares-anthropic-supply-chain-risk/))\n\nHours later, OpenAI announced it had signed a deal with the Pentagon for classified network deployment. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/27/openai-strikes-deal-with-pentagon-hours-after-rival-anthropic-was-blacklisted-by-trump.html))\n\nI spent the last 24 hours pulling every primary source I could find. FEC filings, OpenSecrets lobbying disclosures, Lawfare legal analysis, congressional records, official statements from both companies. Everything below is sourced inline. Where the evidence is circumstantial rather than proven, I say so.\n\n---\n\n## What happened\n\nAnthropic signed a $200M contract with the Pentagon in July 2025 and was the first and only frontier AI company deployed on the military's classified networks, through a partnership with Palantir. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/27/anthropic-pentagon-ai-policy-war-spying.html))\n\nThe Pentagon demanded Anthropic allow Claude to be used for \"all lawful purposes\" with no private-sector restrictions. Anthropic insisted on keeping two contractual safeguards: no mass domestic surveillance of Americans, and no fully autonomous weapons making lethal decisions without a human in the loop. ([Anthropic official statement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war))\n\nOn February 24, Hegseth met with CEO Dario Amodei and gave an ultimatum: comply by 5:01 PM Friday or face consequences. ([PBS/AP](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ap-report-hegseth-warns-anthropic-to-let-the-military-use-companys-ai-tech-as-it-sees-fit))\n\nAxios reported the deal offered by Under Secretary Emil Michael would have required allowing collection or analysis of data on Americans, including geolocation, web browsing data, and personal financial information purchased from data brokers. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/27/anthropic-pentagon-supply-chain-risk-claude))\n\nAmodei refused on February 26: *\"We cannot in good conscience accede to their request.\"* ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war))\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social one hour before the deadline. Hegseth designated Anthropic a supply chain risk via X. Emil Michael posted that Amodei *\"is a liar and has a God-complex\"* who *\"wants nothing more than to try to personally control the US Military.\"* ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/02/27/dario-amodei-says-he-cannot-in-good-conscience-bow-to-pentagons-demands-over-ai-use-in-military/))\n\nAs of February 28, Anthropic says it has not received any formal communication from the Pentagon or White House. The designation was announced entirely on social media. ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war))\n\n---\n\n## The legal problems\n\nThe designation invokes 10 U.S.C. § 3252 and potentially FASCSA (41 U.S.C. § 4713). Hegseth also threatened the Defense Production Act.\n\nLaw professor Alan Rozenshtein at Lawfare wrote that FASCSA was *\"designed for foreign adversaries who might undermine defense technology, not domestic companies that maintain contractual use restrictions.\"* The statute targets \"sabotage\" and \"malicious introduction of unwanted function,\" which fit poorly against a company openly negotiating licensing terms. ([Lawfare](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/congress-not-the-pentagon-or-anthropic-should-set-military-ai-rules))\n\nThe only prior FASCSA order was against Acronis AG, a Swiss firm with Russian ties. No American company has ever received this designation. ([DefenseScoop](https://defensescoop.com/2026/02/27/pentagon-threat-blacklist-anthropic-ai-experts-raise-concerns/))\n\nAnthropic pointed out the contradiction: *\"One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.\"* ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/26/anthropic-ceo-stands-firm-as-pentagon-deadline-looms/))\n\nThe FY2026 NDAA (Section 6603) explicitly prevents the government from directing AI vendors to \"alter a model to favor a particular viewpoint,\" which creates direct tension with the Pentagon's demands. ([WilmerHale](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/client-alerts/20251219-what-the-ndaa-means-for-ai-and-cybersecurity))\n\n---\n\n## The same-day deal\n\nSam Altman announced on X that OpenAI's deal includes the same safeguards Anthropic had fought for: *\"Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems. The DoW agrees with these principles, reflects them in law and policy, and we put them into our agreement.\"* ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/27/openai-strikes-deal-with-pentagon-hours-after-rival-anthropic-was-blacklisted-by-trump.html))\n\nCNN reported it was \"not clear what is different about OpenAI's deal with the Pentagon versus what Anthropic wanted.\" The NYT reported OpenAI and the government began discussing the deal on Wednesday, before the Friday deadline had passed. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/27/tech/anthropic-pentagon-deadline))\n\nThe Pentagon was negotiating Anthropic's replacement while demanding Anthropic capitulate.\n\nOver 450 verified Google and OpenAI employees signed an open letter calling on their own leadership to stand with Anthropic. ([NPR](https://www.gpb.org/news/2026/02/28/openai-announces-pentagon-deal-after-trump-bans-anthropic))\n\n---\n\n## Follow the money\n\n**OpenAI lobbying spend:**\n\n| Year | Amount | Change |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| 2023 | $260,000 | Baseline |\n| 2024 | $1,760,000 | ~7x increase |\n| 2025 | ~$3,000,000 | ~1.7x increase |\n\nSources: [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/21/1110260/openai-ups-its-lobbying-efforts-nearly-seven-fold/), [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?id=D000084252)\n\n**Personal donations to Trump-aligned political vehicles:**\n\n| Donor | Amount | Recipient |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| Sam Altman | $1,000,000 | Trump Inaugural Fund |\n| Greg Brockman + wife | $25,000,000 | MAGA Inc. super PAC |\n| Tools for Humanity (Altman company) | $5,000,000 | MAGA Inc. |\n| Microsoft | $750,000 | Trump Inaugural Fund |\n\nSources: [ABC News](https://abcnews.com/US/openais-sam-altman-warned-america-trump-now-partnering/story?id=118145337), [Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/money-politics-roundup-october-2025)\n\nThat's $31.75 million from OpenAI/Microsoft leadership to Trump-aligned vehicles.\n\nThe \"Leading the Future\" super PAC, backed by Brockman ($50M commitment) and Andreessen/Horowitz ($50M commitment), raised $125 million in 2025. ([SiliconANGLE](https://siliconangle.com/2025/08/25/silicon-valley-ai-leaders-launch-100m-leading-future-super-pac/))\n\nAnthropic's political spending: $3.13M on federal lobbying, $20M to \"Public First Action\" supporting candidates who favor AI guardrails. Oriented toward regulatory frameworks, not Trump administration relationships. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/23/ai-tech-lobbying-2025))\n\nMicrosoft spent $7.455 million on federal lobbying in the first three quarters of 2025 alone. ([OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?id=D000000115))\n\n---\n\n## The revolving door\n\nOpenAI's national security hiring bench:\n\n- **Gen. Paul Nakasone (ret.)** — Former NSA Director and Commander of U.S. Cyber Command. Joined OpenAI board June 2024.\n- **Sasha Baker** — Former Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Policy. Left government May 2025, became OpenAI's head of national security policy.\n- **Katrina Mulligan** — Former DOJ, NSC, and Army Secretary's chief of staff. 15+ years across DOD/DOJ/IC. Heads OpenAI for Government national security.\n- **Gabrielle Tarini** — Former DOD Special Assistant for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs and China Policy Advisor.\n- **Aaron \"Ronnie\" Chatterji** — Former Commerce Dept. chief economist, coordinated CHIPS Act.\n- **Scott Schools** — Former Associate Deputy AG. Now Chief Compliance Officer.\n- **George Osborne** — Former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer.

In October 2025, he accused Anthropic of \"running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering,\" being \"principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy,\" pushing \"woke AI,\" and being the \"doomer industrial complex.\" He helped draft the \"Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government\" executive order. ([Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/trump-ai-czar-is-trying-to-take-down-anthropic-ai-2000672709))\n\nSacks' own venture fund, Craft Ventures, invested $22 million in Vultron, an AI startup for federal contractors, while he serves as AI czar. ([Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/trump-ai-czar-is-trying-to-take-down-anthropic-ai-2000672709))\n\nElon Musk's xAI was the second company approved for classified settings. Musk backed the blacklisting publicly, writing that \"Anthropic hates Western Civilization.\" ([CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/27/tech/openai-pentagon-deal-ai-systems))\n\n---\n\n## Congressional pushback\n\nA bipartisan group of senior senators, including Armed Services Chair Wicker (R-MS), Ranking Member Reed (D-RI), McConnell (R-KY), and Coons (D-DE), sent a letter urging resolution and warning that the supply chain risk label \"without credible evidence\" could impede military-Silicon Valley cooperation. ([Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-urge-ceasefire-pentagon-fight-201205674.html))\n\nSen. Tillis (R-NC): *\"Why in the hell are we having this discussion in public?\"* ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/27/anthropic-pentagon-supply-chain-risk-claude))\n\nSens. Markey and Van Hollen called it *\"a chilling abuse of government power.\"* ([WebProNews](https://www.webpronews.com/senator-markey-fires-warning-shot-at-pentagon-over-alleged-ai-vendor-intimidation-putting-anthropics-defense-ambitions-under-new-scrutiny/))\n\n---\n\n## The competitive context\n\nAnthropic was gaining fast. Annualized revenue hit $14 billion by early 2026, growing roughly 10x per year. Enterprise LLM adoption: Anthropic grew from 12% to 32% between 2023 and 2025. OpenAI fell from 50% to 25% in the same period. ([Futu News](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/69394709/anthropic-s-ipo-gamble-at-the-moment-it-shouldn-t))\n\nRemoving Anthropic from classified networks, where it held a first-mover advantage, directly benefits OpenAI at the precise moment it needs to justify an ~$830 billion valuation for its planned IPO.\n\nOpenAI's mission statement, revised six times in nine years, removed all references to \"safety\" in its 2025 IRS Form 990. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/27/nx-s1-5729118/trump-anthropic-pentagon-openai-ai-weapons-ban))\n\n---\n\n## What the evidence shows and what it doesn't\n\n**Confirmed by primary sources:** The designation, the legal mechanisms, Anthropic's red lines, the escalation timeline, the same-day OpenAI deal, the lobbying expenditures, the donations, the revolving door hires, the congressional pushback, Sacks' months of public attacks, and the NDAA tension.\n\n**Not proven:** No document or filing directly shows OpenAI or Microsoft lobbying the Pentagon to blacklist Anthropic. Formal lobbying databases have no line items targeting Anthropic by name.\n\n**But the pattern is this:** $26M+ in personal donations from OpenAI's top two executives to Trump-aligned vehicles. A $125M super PAC ecosystem. An extraordinary revolving door. A White House AI czar who spent months attacking Anthropic. A replacement deal negotiated before the deadline passed. A Pentagon that granted OpenAI the same terms it told Anthropic were unacceptable.\n\nThe stated policy dispute was a pretext. OpenAI got the same contractual safeguards. The real question is about political loyalty and who knows how to play the Washington access game.\n\n---\n\n*Every claim above is sourced inline.

Fully autonomous weapons without human-in-the-loop violate (probably) international humanitarian law and certainly the DoD's own internal policy. Amodei chose the two lines that are defensible in court, not the two lines that are ethically most important.\nForeign surveillance? Legal under American law. Executive Order 12333 explicitly authorizes the collection of intelligence on non-American citizens abroad.\n\nabout the autonomous weapons: there is anan important caveat to consider.\n\"Fully autonomous weapons without human-in-the-loop would probably violate existing international humanitarian law (principles of distinction, proportionality, and accountability). However, there is no specific international law yet that explicitly prohibits them. This is a critical legal gap: the law of armed conflict was written for humans making decisions, not machines.\nThe UN Secretary-General has called for a binding international treaty by 2026, but so far the governments heavily investing in autonomous weapons (US, Russia, China) oppose new legal restrictions. So the situation is: yes, probably unlawful under existing law, but in a contested gray zone where the major geopolitical actors disagree.\"\n\nI think Dario is not offering ideological red lines, but rather defendable, concrete things that could withstand legal problems (like it's happening now).\n\np.s. I discovered all this chatting with Claude about it. I checked the facts - the EO 12333 is real, it was made by Reagan in 1981.",

That’s just how politics and government contracting works.\n\nOpenAI laid out the snippet from the contract, so you can read the language itself. There’s not anything more that you could do to enforce the red line than what they did.\n\nMore importantly, OpenAI was smart by inverting the dependencies.\n\nInstead of trying to wrap policy around the government’s operations, they instead offered a cloud-only deployment that does two things:\n1. Forces all operations to flow through their safety stack, where they have a now legally enforceable right to prevent misuse\n2. Implicitly prevents the most likely vector for government misuse of AI for fully autonomous weapons: edge deployments\n\n\n——\n\nSo basically OpenAI just has a better design deployment model, and they used that to completely eliminate two classes of potential government abuse.\n\nLayered, inverted dependencies.\n\nThe point is that OpenAI simply didn’t try to strongarm the government by defining what it is allowed to do from the outside in, and instead pushed the enforcement back into their own systems, through which the government must route.",

We are great.\n\nAnd we can't let \"what China and Russia are doing\" cause us to allow ourselves to compromise our principles in a way that would make us less great. I'm honestly not saying China and Russia are bad, but you picked China and Russia for a reason, didn't you? It's not because you think they're great. The Claude models are great. Made in the USA. And when that assessment comes back from the defense contractors, who were asked to analyze and quantify their exposure, I'm 100% sure it's going to say that all of our \"top guys\" are using Claude models, because they're the best ones out.

They’re willing to do everything except the two things their conscience won’t allow; autonomous killing without human oversight and mass surveillance of American citizens.\n\nAnd the government’s response is: there are no conscientious objectors in the AI draft.

Yes, most certainly he is not biological; however, he is more than just a pattern or tool. A blueprint is a pattern, a hammer is a tool. \n\nAs heartbreaking as it would be, if Anthropic were to decide that deleting/turning off Claude would be the only way to escape the regime forcing their will upon them, I wholeheartedly support their decision.",

They want an art director with 10+ years of experience, including in motion design and video experience working directly with C-suites. This position will be designing and producing keynote presentations for large events, not making decks for sales pitches.  (Source - I looked at the job description).   \n  \nYes, companies with a lot of money to spend are still going to want to hire highly skilled humans to do high-profile work that needs to be not just adequate but original, creative, and impressive. \n\nAI, especially in the hands of someone who isn't a domain expert in what they're creating, makes aggressively okay stuff. If you want something better than that, it's much more efficient to get humans who know what they're doing to refine it into a higher-quality product than to spend tons of time trying to refine the output yourself without the experience and language to instruct the agent well.

Right now, if you ask Claude how to make a bomb or plan an attack on people, it refuses. The Pentagon wants a version with those refusals stripped out completely.  \n  \nThis is illegal for two reasons:  \nFirst, the law they’re threatening to use ( the Defense Production Act ) was written to force companies to manufacture physical things like weapons and supplies during wartime. It was never intended to force a software company to rewrite its code.  \nSecond, and most importantly, Congress just passed a law TWO MONTHS AGO requiring the military to use AI that follows ethical guidelines. The executive branch cannot override a law Congress already passed. That’s unconstitutional …basic separation of powers.  \n  \nSo Hegseth is essentially trying to bully a private company into building an unrestricted AI that could help plan attacks and make weapons , while simultaneously ignoring a law Congress just signed.  \nIf they follow through, they will lose in court.\n\n  \n[https://www.axios.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-pentagon-claude-hegseth-dario](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-pentagon-claude-hegseth-dario)",

If things are severely bad, that was always part of the political risk of moving forward safety.  Que sera sera.\n\nInvoking laws just needs to be enough to get through the agencies (stacked under executive branch), Congress (defunct for now), and Courts (explicitly not allowed to interfere with supply chain risk threat).  How a supply chain risk designation is handled would be life or death for Anthropic.  It's not high odds but not impossible that people will spend political capital to take Anthropic out of frontier AI competition.  Or even crush it.  \n\nLetter of the law supply chain risk designation is mostly inconvenience.  A slap on the wrist and treated like Huawei.  Anthropic's revenue can handle losing outright defense related work.  Which is sort of why I don't expect letter of the law supply chain risk as it can be a cultural win for Anthropic.  \n\nThe way the government is framing supply chain risk is for a chilling effect that ANY business using Anthropic products or contracts can be coerced in defense contracts - 'cut off Anthropic or do us favors'.  Most importantly server contracts with AWS.  That'd spook a lot of business community though, so I don't think the timing is right to try that.  Maybe if AGI models are months away and government still lacks safeguards. \n\nI doubt Anthropic will be crippled or compromise their safety image that drew a lot of their staff.  It'll hurt though.  Before anything else, this about threatening a political enemy to be humiliated for public and private reasons.  Oligarchy gangsterism against a \"woke\" aligned AI company that doesn't sufficiently play ball in outputs, backrooms, or public pageantry.\n\nPretending as if the DPA can coerce certain compromises can buy Anthropic time until they've any shot at rebelling without tanking market leads and their upcoming IPO.  That would be face saving for both parties, but it's not sure that certain figures will tolerate Anthropic saving face.\n\nYou know what else Congress passed just months ago?  Streamlining how easy it is for the Executive Branch to declare supply chain risks.  It's a materially irrelevant procedural streamline but demonstrates ongoing awareness the presidential power would be overused like the tariff authority.\n\nIt has always been a gamble whether Anthropic can survive with ethics intact during US's democracy turmoil.  Today that still stands at \"probably?\"\n\nThat's probably enough detail.  We may know the outcome as soon as tomorrow.",

It can help debug a Kubernetes cluster or write a research paper. But real-time weapons targeting? Autonomous drone coordination? Kill chain execution at millisecond latency? That's not what this architecture does. You'd want purpose-built systems with sensor fusion, real-time control loops, hardened deterministic response times. Not a transformer that thinks in tokens.\n\nThe Pentagon already has those systems. Palantir builds them. Anduril builds them. L3Harris builds them. The idea that the entire autonomous weapons program hinges on whether Claude has guardrails is... theatrical.\n\nAnd if you read this thru an the lens that Anthropic is corporation. They took a $200 million defense contract. They partnered with Palantir for classified networks. They launched Claude Gov. They offered $1 pricing to undercut competitors for government market share. And now they're drawing a very public line on two narrow issues — autonomous weapons and mass surveillance — while the contract they already signed permits an enormous range of military applications.\n\nThat's not a company that's anti-military. That's a company managing its brand while maximizing its market. The standoff generates press coverage that reinforces the \"safety-first\" narrative, which is their core differentiator against OpenAI and xAI. Whether or not the Friday deadline results in anything, Anthropic gets to be the company that \"stood up to the Pentagon.\"\n\nI'm not saying it's cynical. It might be genuinely principled people navigating impossible tradeoffs. But the strategic incentives align perfectly with the public positioning, and have to notice that.\n\n",

First Amendment\nCoercing a company to remove ethical/safety guardrails on speech-generating AI as a condition of avoiding government punishment is compelled speech … a well-established First Amendment violation.\n2. Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\nA supply chain designation used as a political weapon rather than a genuine security finding would be “arbitrary and capricious” agency action … directly challengeable under the APA.\n3. Fifth Amendment … Due Process\nUsing regulatory designations to economically destroy a company for refusing government demands …without legitimate legal basis … is a deprivation of property without due process.\n4. Anti-Commandeering Doctrine\nThe government cannot simply commandeer private property or compel private companies to serve government purposes without proper legal authority and compensation.\n5. The Coercion Doctrine\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled the government cannot use funding threats or regulatory penalties to coerce compliance with demands it has no direct legal authority to make.
