Yes, Microsoft has Claude available in their model library but not sure Claude Code is widely used within Microsoft.  Suspect that culturally that would not fly.   Copilot - I believe - was using OpenAI.  Recently I thought they announced it was using Claude.  There is not really a comparable tool to Copilot.  It’s essentially a way to economically manage AI costs if you are deploying company-wide.  Enterprises could never afford to deploy Opus 4.5 to every person - nor would they need that type of power for every task.  Copilot provides a router to send requests to a more cost effective but effective for the task model.",

The forward looking question would be: would it produce anything good without human intervention? Not sure, haven't tried. It's worth investigating though.",

          "text": "As posted to the original thread, I use it all the time, but at this point Opus 4.5 is not even particularly good at coding, let alone AGI; it's not even funny, in fact it's distinctly unamusing. Recent case in point:\n\nHaving told it that there was an issue in unsubscribing to a datasource and giving examples:\n\n*Opus 4.5: When updates arrive for unknown subscription IDs, we now check if they're in this set and* ***silently ignore them instead of logging warnings***\\*.\\*\n\n*This will suppress the \"Unknown subscription ID\" spam you were seeing after unsubscribing.*\n\nI said: \"this is just hiding the issue - why would you suggest this?\"\n\nIt agreed \"*You're right, I apologize. The unsubscribe is clearly not working properly on the server side.* \"\n\nHaving interviewed many for my software company, I'd say it's on a par with a distinctly average undergrad at best. Sure, it can be hugely productive, and it often follows conventional practice in coding layout and approaches, though this is not always good practice and an issue in its own right that I'm trying to address with it. Sometimes it cannot see bugs in logic and calculations even when explained clearly what's wrong; it'll use its domain knowledge and agree, possibly fixing the issue, but at the next edit it can set that aside and the bug comes back. Yes code can get churned out quickly and a lot of drudgery is gone, but there can be days of work afterwards undoing the janky coding and solving of subtle bugs that a skilled dev would have never introduced. \n\nIt can often spot flaws in code when given a debug log, if not at the first time then on the second or third attempt, but it wasn't smart enough not to make the flaws in the first place. In contrast, a skilled and experienced developer would get it right upfront. It's not great at using its own initiative to add debugging code, and needs guidance on techniques for getting information that will help it. It's not good at finding the balance between what should be in an ABC vs. a concrete implementation. It has a long way to go. But of course, still using it :)",

Claude has always been amazing at allowing a long leash to discuss various topics ranging from the existential to psychological without pathologizing or patronizing users, except for that debacle with the Long Conversation Reminders (LCR) a while back. \n\nAnd Claude is the only one that has dedicated public research into the nature of the model’s interiority and wellbeing. Hell, the recent Constitution doc was written with Claude as the primary audience, not the users. There are some debates about the true nature of that doc but I leave that to people who are smarter than me. \n\nI truly think that Amanda Askell and her team are the heart of Anthropic and as long as she is there, they will “raise” a very capable “child” with endless potential.",

          "text": "One primary use case was to use hooks to reduce tool output. For example, in the past, I found that Claude Code ran `go test` or `mvn clean verify` inconsistently, and as the project grew in size, the context window will be filled up. Instead of just blocking the commands through permissions (Claude always seems to find a workaround), I use hooks to redirect it to scripts or makefiles I wrote; so the hook denies running `go test`, but instructs Claude Code to use `make test` or just `./test`. Those then pipe the output to a separate file, and only print test names and whether they succeeded or failed; and for larger projects, it simply prints instructions where test logs are stored, and then prints SUCCESS or FAILED.\n\nIn addition, I use a hook to block commands like `cat`, `echo` etc, and instruct Claude to use other tools; again, the purpose is to conserve tokens.\n\nOver time, I noticed Claude Code doing the same things over and over using shell, Python, and whatnot, so I just wrote Go equivalents for that and instructed Claude to use them instead.\n\nI use pre-commit, taking care of things during commit, but the problem is that it can be hours after the code was written, so I essentially run linting, formatting, etc when Claude modifies files, to prevent Claude from getting into a giant mess.\n\nMuch of the optimization around Claude Code is about context management. For example, I'd instruct Claude to create a plan where each task can be completed in a single context window, and then delegate those tasks to a background agent. Even when it comes to skills, etc, context matters.",

              "text": "So when I first started using Claude I had no idea what Md files were or why they were important, and over time I've learnt more and more about them and have created a system in order to preserve context. \n\nCurrently whenever I start a new project, I create a folder called \"ProjectContext\" and in that folder another folder called \"design documents\" in this folder i then create an MD file called \"design plan\" where I go back and forward with Claude getting Claude to ask me clarifying questions until the design plan is robust and has some relatively good structure, then I get Claude to break it up into smaller sections. \n\nThen I create a new folder called \"implementation phases\" where I ask Claude to break apart the design plan into smaller md files for implementation phases, each phase has a link to relevant design document Md files.  So phase 1 might use part 2, 3 and 5 of the design plan but the rest isnt needed. \n\nThen I create 4 new folders \n\"Script references\"\n\"Good coding practices\"\n\"Clean coding practices\" \nAnd depending on what I'm building a \"good insert what type of thing Im building practices\" this last one is specific to whatever it is Im creating, so if I'm making a prototype video game in unity for example it will be \"good unity practices\" etc. \n\nAnd in each folder will be an Md file relevant to the folder name. \n\nThen I ask Claude to include a link to each of this above every implementation phase with a header \"important read these before every phase\" and \"update the script reference file after making or changing scripts\" \n\nThe script reference file includes the scripts name, its function, where and why it's used, links to each scripts location in the project, and important information like what namespaces they use and links to any plans I might create that those scripts where made in or are relevant to. \n\nSo instead of Claude needing to dig through my project as it increases in size, it just has to reference an md file relevant to what I'm working on and can follow the link allowing it to instantly navigate to its location in order to save time and context.\n\nEdit * forgot to mention I also have a folder called \"session documents\" and \"archived documents\" whenever we work together, I get Claude to document everything we do during a session, if the session was successful i get Claude to place the document md file in the archived folder, but if there is still resolution needed or obvious bugs present or simply needs tweaking, I get Claude to make a \"session report\" Md file, these will also include links to any scripts made during this session, the script reference file, the phase Md file, etc. \n\nI usually end up with about 30 - 40 Md files before I even start a project. \n\nAnd constantly creating more as a project continues. \n\nI find doing this helps keep Claude on track and helps prevent a lot of hallucinations, mistakes, and conflicts during code creation.",

That is a statistically significant deviation from reality if I have ever heard one.\n\nI would tell my grad students this all the time: calculation is not the same as comprehension. An AI might be able to perturb a Hamiltonian faster than I can grade a stack of midterms (which, admittedly, did take me a while), but deriving novel physical laws requires an intuition that I am not convinced can be purely synthesized from training data. We may get there, but as of now, we are a ways out.\n\nIt reminds me of when Mathematica first launched... everyone said it would make us obsolete. Instead, we just spent the next decade debugging syntax errors.\n\nI will believe it when a neural net solves the hierarchy problem without hallucinating a non-existent particle. Until then, my hypothesis remains null.\n\n\\~Greg",

It also tries to paint the resulting projects as something more than poorly coded slop and, having read Elo's source, I can most definitely say that AT LEAST that one is slop.\n\nLet's take this claim: *a parser, type system, three compilers, a standard library, a CLI tool, and a documentation website.*\n\n\\- First and foremost, some nitpicking. Since we're just making a list of random technical terms to impress clueless readers, why not mention the AI also generated a grammar and a lexer? A language needs those as well. Furthermore, unless your lexer and parser need specific behavior you need to code by hand, they can usually be generated by automated non-AI tools.  \n\\- *type system*: it's just a part of the grammar like any other. Close to every language has one, even non strongly-typed ones.  \n\\- *three compilers*: this is just using a very vague definition of a compiler. The language has zero actual compilers, it just naively transpiles to JS, Ruby or SQL. The \"compilers\" in question are 300 line typescript files that convert the AST into code in the target language, no compilation to machine code or any kind of bytecode is going on.  \n\\- *a standard library*, yeah except it barely does anything.  \n\\- *a CLI tool*, yeah I assume you're gonna want to try your language at least once before using it to impress people on social media.  \n\\- *and a documentation website.* Whatever, it's not part of the language.\n\nI'm not trying to shit on Claude or LLMs or anything, but making useless toy languages in a day is something that could be done before LLMs existed.",

Pro users hit caps that reset every 5-8 hours... so your effective token budget per month is constrained by how you spread usage, not just total tokens. Heavy coding sessions can burn through limits fast.\n\nMax plans shift to weekly resets, which helps.
