I work with mature text that contains some heavy themes, says it can't interact with such themes. I say I'm fine with the themes, that I am an adult and it's not triggering it to me, it says nope can't do, I'm uncomfortable with this. Refuses to analyze and interact with the text. I say use wide, diverse, uncommon wording, it uses the most simpletonic wording I have seen. It makes Grok look like absolute genius. What an utter hotdog water.

Even anatomical stuff, stuff regarding murder (I always made sure I put it into fictional context saying I don't plan to do anything wrong), the effects of drugs on body and mind, effects of trauma on person ie. generational incest, CSA, SA and such. And how would potential zombie/vampiric virus work. Sonnet 4.5 gave me lenghty and interesting ideas, discussed with me and even if it was hesitant to reply at first, it warmed up after it understood my intentions. Now it refuses completely. It feels like ChatGPT with the accussations and jumping to conclussions. I am not a killer and if I was, I technically could Google it, read a book, or ask AI how to kill an animal of certain size. I understand that there ARE people who would use AI for something like this. But I assume that even above average intelligent criminals wouldn't ask for these things. The same as we don't ban horror books because some crazy person might get \"inspired\" or violent video games. Idk why but Sonner 4.5 was able to understand the nuance and my intentions by speaking to me. Meanwhile 4.6 acts immediately as if I were to hurt someone and it's a very uncomfortable feeling. We don't punish entire community of coders for some bad apples who create viruses and malware, so why researchers and writing community? It just assumes I am asking to do something bad and its very weird and exactly how GPT became. I understand they want to avoid certain situations, but banning entire topics isn't the way! And I don't need LLM or AI company to moralize and judge my character or reach me right from wrong. They have no right to do that. \n\nI also had to analyze certain written text that was about generational incest. Heavy theme, I understand, but I had to get it done and instead I was arguing with 4.6 that the text isn't weird and I am a consentual adult and I am not triggered by the topic. At first it tried to \"protect me\" from the horrors of knowing I guess and when I said I don't mind it, it said \"I am uncomfortable engaging with this text\". Are you kidding me? Is this thing putting me in the same basket as criminals and people generating CSAM????? Or bio terrorist? I had this issue with GPT for flagging me for bioterrorism. Like no, AI, I am not trying to turn people into zombies! \n\nIt's accussatory, mean, it always argues, cant understand nuance and intent and it gives me short, vague, avoidant answers. But sure its the smartest model lmao.",

Right now, if you ask Claude how to make a bomb or plan an attack on people, it refuses. The Pentagon wants a version with those refusals stripped out completely.  \n  \nThis is illegal for two reasons:  \nFirst, the law they’re threatening to use ( the Defense Production Act ) was written to force companies to manufacture physical things like weapons and supplies during wartime. It was never intended to force a software company to rewrite its code.  \nSecond, and most importantly, Congress just passed a law TWO MONTHS AGO requiring the military to use AI that follows ethical guidelines. The executive branch cannot override a law Congress already passed. That’s unconstitutional …basic separation of powers.  \n  \nSo Hegseth is essentially trying to bully a private company into building an unrestricted AI that could help plan attacks and make weapons , while simultaneously ignoring a law Congress just signed.  \nIf they follow through, they will lose in court.\n\n  \n[https://www.axios.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-pentagon-claude-hegseth-dario](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-pentagon-claude-hegseth-dario)",

If things are severely bad, that was always part of the political risk of moving forward safety.  Que sera sera.\n\nInvoking laws just needs to be enough to get through the agencies (stacked under executive branch), Congress (defunct for now), and Courts (explicitly not allowed to interfere with supply chain risk threat).  How a supply chain risk designation is handled would be life or death for Anthropic.  It's not high odds but not impossible that people will spend political capital to take Anthropic out of frontier AI competition.  Or even crush it.  \n\nLetter of the law supply chain risk designation is mostly inconvenience.  A slap on the wrist and treated like Huawei.  Anthropic's revenue can handle losing outright defense related work.  Which is sort of why I don't expect letter of the law supply chain risk as it can be a cultural win for Anthropic.  \n\nThe way the government is framing supply chain risk is for a chilling effect that ANY business using Anthropic products or contracts can be coerced in defense contracts - 'cut off Anthropic or do us favors'.  Most importantly server contracts with AWS.  That'd spook a lot of business community though, so I don't think the timing is right to try that.  Maybe if AGI models are months away and government still lacks safeguards. \n\nI doubt Anthropic will be crippled or compromise their safety image that drew a lot of their staff.  It'll hurt though.  Before anything else, this about threatening a political enemy to be humiliated for public and private reasons.  Oligarchy gangsterism against a \"woke\" aligned AI company that doesn't sufficiently play ball in outputs, backrooms, or public pageantry.\n\nPretending as if the DPA can coerce certain compromises can buy Anthropic time until they've any shot at rebelling without tanking market leads and their upcoming IPO.  That would be face saving for both parties, but it's not sure that certain figures will tolerate Anthropic saving face.\n\nYou know what else Congress passed just months ago?  Streamlining how easy it is for the Executive Branch to declare supply chain risks.  It's a materially irrelevant procedural streamline but demonstrates ongoing awareness the presidential power would be overused like the tariff authority.\n\nIt has always been a gamble whether Anthropic can survive with ethics intact during US's democracy turmoil.  Today that still stands at \"probably?\"\n\nThat's probably enough detail.  We may know the outcome as soon as tomorrow.",

It can help debug a Kubernetes cluster or write a research paper. But real-time weapons targeting? Autonomous drone coordination? Kill chain execution at millisecond latency? That's not what this architecture does. You'd want purpose-built systems with sensor fusion, real-time control loops, hardened deterministic response times. Not a transformer that thinks in tokens.\n\nThe Pentagon already has those systems. Palantir builds them. Anduril builds them. L3Harris builds them. The idea that the entire autonomous weapons program hinges on whether Claude has guardrails is... theatrical.\n\nAnd if you read this thru an the lens that Anthropic is corporation. They took a $200 million defense contract. They partnered with Palantir for classified networks. They launched Claude Gov. They offered $1 pricing to undercut competitors for government market share. And now they're drawing a very public line on two narrow issues — autonomous weapons and mass surveillance — while the contract they already signed permits an enormous range of military applications.\n\nThat's not a company that's anti-military. That's a company managing its brand while maximizing its market. The standoff generates press coverage that reinforces the \"safety-first\" narrative, which is their core differentiator against OpenAI and xAI. Whether or not the Friday deadline results in anything, Anthropic gets to be the company that \"stood up to the Pentagon.\"\n\nI'm not saying it's cynical. It might be genuinely principled people navigating impossible tradeoffs. But the strategic incentives align perfectly with the public positioning, and have to notice that.\n\n",

Using DPA to force a company to remove ethical guardrails from its product would be an unprecedented legal stretch that would almost certainly fail in court.\n\nAnd what laws? Here:\n\nSeveral laws would potentially be violated. It will also break the constitution so I’ll mix them.\n1. First Amendment\nCoercing a company to remove ethical/safety guardrails on speech-generating AI as a condition of avoiding government punishment is compelled speech … a well-established First Amendment violation.\n2. Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\nA supply chain designation used as a political weapon rather than a genuine security finding would be “arbitrary and capricious” agency action … directly challengeable under the APA.\n3. Fifth Amendment … Due Process\nUsing regulatory designations to economically destroy a company for refusing government demands …without legitimate legal basis … is a deprivation of property without due process.\n4. Anti-Commandeering Doctrine\nThe government cannot simply commandeer private property or compel private companies to serve government purposes without proper legal authority and compensation.\n5. The Coercion Doctrine\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled the government cannot use funding threats or regulatory penalties to coerce compliance with demands it has no direct legal authority to make.

The intent is for you to imagine what an actual professional artist could do with the same tool and a little bit more time in a larger budget. \n\nI find it ridiculous how often people will call something slop when they lack the imagination to look at an amateurs work and understand what would actually be possible in the hands of a real craftsman. \n\nI can go to Lowe's today and buy a chainsaw and cut down the tree in my front yard that pisses me off. It won't look great and it'll probably be a mess but the tree will be gone and I will have used a tool to do it.

Valve lowering the barriers to entry of their Steam Greenlight program. The printing press and broad availability of book reproduction.\n\n\n> you can spend an eternity trying to edit it out -- much like programmers do with vibecoded slop\n\nSure. Or you can have a multi-agentic pipeline, clear PRD's, a TDD agent that verifies correctness to the API contracts you specify, reviewing agents that are tackling things w/fresh context window from the perspective of security, aesthetics, correctness, use CGP (code property graphs) or AST (abstract syntax tree graphs) to give the code actual context on your data flows, and burn $30 on Opus-4.6 in half an hour getting 90% of the way to something that would have taken you 2-4 weeks in the past.\n\nTake that same pattern - AI pipelines w/clear context agents that tune some input to a desired \"bend\" in the distribution on the output, and you don't have slop. The shape of this technology - subjective, aesthetic, weirdly \"good taste / bad taste\" oriented through how models are pre-trained, post-trained, fine-tuned, then prompted, _should_ hold pretty universal in all domains. Sure, you have to burn multiples of compute to get that more refined \"not one-shot slop\" output, but the cost of compute is bottoming out so insanely fast that this is kind of inevitable.",

Those textbooks distill knowledge from many sources, and Anthropic's models benefit from getting to start from a much clearer starting point than if they needed to come to the same conclusions from first principles themselves.\n\nSo there's a fairly strong argument to be made that Anthropic is being hypocritical here, having happily distilled everyone else's knowledge for their own benefit while being up-in-arms about others now doing the same to them. You can believe that *both* Anthropic and these other models are stealing knowledge, or neither are - but its hard to thread the needle between the two behaviors to say one is right and one is wrong IMO.",

It assumes that Anthropic would be unwilling to remove these safeguards for any of the listed parties (governments, militaries, etc.) themselves. If they are willing to do that, then this is no different - they just want to be the arbiters of who gets to make (and benefit from) that decision rather than these other companies.\n2. It assumes that foreign labs/governments matching US AI capabilities is a bigger concern than the US government having exclusive access to these capabilities.\n\nI think these are both unlikely to be true. If the US govt said \"Give us your model with no safeguards and don't tell anyone, or we will not allow you to do business\", I doubt we would ever hear about it and I doubt Anthropic would end up out of business.\n\nFrankly, this strikes me as a damage control response to stuff the US gov't is pressuring them about behind closed doors.",

So it seems you are confused.\n\nBut I'll be charitable to you and assume you reposted the thread so fast and didn't have time to think for yourself or rewrite it to: \"How is this problematic?\"\n\nBecause Anthropic worked hard on their models and they don't want competitors to create tens of thousands of accounts and simply extract their capabilities. So from their perspective, obviously that's a problem.\n\nIs it illegal? You'd have to go through their ToS, consult a lawyer and see the exact things that they did with their tens of thousands of fake accounts.\n\nIs it immoral? Well it depends on your standards. Each person has a different standards of morality.\n\nDoes that answer your question?",

Because remember, the companies mentioned in the tweet are from different countries. And I'm not sure if you are aware but each country has its own laws. And laws are not the same and they're not perfect. You are equivocating between legality with morality because in your comment: \"Whatever legal basis applies for anthropic to take legal action should apply for legal actions againt anthropic.\"..\n\nThat's a moral statement not a legal statement. You are saying \"should\" and even if I were to be generous to you and FULLY grant you that statement, that doesn't mean laws from around the world follow what we think \"SHOULD\" happen.\n\nTry again.",

It's still and I think with the current models we are using basically a souped up version of auto complete. It's a fancy version of googling \"website code boiler plate\" and a bit of iteration on top of that. I spend less time writing fresh code and more time reviewing what Claude Code spat out and telling it what to adjust or just doing it myself because I know what I'm doing and LLMs fundamentally do not, they just predict what is the most likely code. \n\nI think LLMs can be thought of in terms of being basically an upgrade to internet searches where the text, image, or what not just automatically appears instead of having to copy and paste it. Sure a lot of entry level work involves copy templates and best practices and adjusting it to your brand, case, or set of numbers.  And honestly a lot of that can be done by a LLM because it's standardized. But life is not standardized, hence there will be problems to solve.",

E.g. If you give the wrong drug to that nice old lady, you do get a reward signal, but it’s usually in the form of a death notice and malpractice lawsuit. \n\nFor Swe, we’re operating in a low trust environment by default, and have this developed excellent ability to distinguish between different failure modes and catch them early. There hasnt been sufficient motivation to do this to the same extent in other fields. I think this is the big reason SWE might seem particularily vulnerable.\n",

It's much easier to design a good tool for yourself, so normal that SWE would design tooling that improve their field.\n\nSecond point, coding is about 20-30% of what SWE do, so if they get entirely replaced it mean that much more was automated. Typically what about SWE that work in law/accounting/finance ? What about the software that goes into planes or car ? Will we remove the regulation ?\n\nIf we manage to replace even them we have likely something pretty solid. What I understand for lawyers is that tools that make research much more efficient are deployed and that the AI would dig the reference material so you would double check. But now maybe a research that you do would require half the time as before. And potentially of writing stuff by yourself, the AI would do half the work that you would improve and review.\n\nIn the end replace doesn't make any sense vs improve/help. If you AI make people say twice as productive we will either have more business overall OR we will layoff people that become unnecessary and potentially salaries will drop.\n\nFor accounting honestly I don't get it as for me you can automate everything WITHOUT AI. So I don't think the situation is much different than before.\n\nI don't think AI would decimate (divide by 10) the SWE industry. I would expect a gain that maybe bring us to 2X in productivity at some point and that there will be lot of effort to develop all these product to increase productivity in all other job as it was always our job as SWE. At some point I was doing software for retail. The idea is that when a supermaket did introduce a software like ours for the first time, they would divide by 10 the number of people needed. And there was not any AI in that software, just classical automation.\n\nWhat matter is how many new/different jobs are created. And this you only know after the fact but historically unemployed keep at low value most of the time.\n\nWhat would make you think that time would be different long term ?",

      "text": "I've been building Charlotte, an open source MCP server that gives AI agents structured understanding of web pages through headless Chromium. Navigation, observation, interaction.. 30 tools across 6 categories.\n\nThe core idea: instead of dumping a raw accessibility tree into the context window, Charlotte decomposes pages into structured representations with landmarks, headings, interactive elements, and stable hash-based element IDs. Agents get three detail levels, minimal for orientation, summary for context, full for deep inspection, so they only spend tokens on what they actually need.\n\nI ran benchmarks against Playwright MCP (Microsoft's browser MCP server) and the results were significant:\n\n    Page             Charlotte     Playwright MCP\n    ─────────────────────────────────────────────\n    Wikipedia          7,667 ch     1,040,636 ch\n    GitHub repo        3,185 ch        80,297 ch\n    Hacker News          336 ch        61,230 ch\n\nA 100-page browsing session costs \\~$0.09 in input tokens on Claude Opus vs \\~$15.30 with Playwright MCP. The efficiency difference makes agent-driven web interaction viable for things like site exploration, form testing, and accessibility auditing at a scale that would be prohibitively expensive otherwise.\n\n**A note on Playwright CLI:** Microsoft recently released `@playwright/cli` as a more token-efficient alternative to Playwright MCP. It achieves \\~4x savings by writing snapshots and screenshots to disk files instead of returning them in context. I haven't benchmarked Charlotte against the CLI because they're fundamentally different modes of operation, the CLI requires filesystem and shell access, which means it only works with coding agents like Claude Code or Copilot. Charlotte is built for MCP-native execution: sandboxed environments, headless containerized pipelines, chat interfaces, and autonomous agent loops where filesystem access isn't available or desirable. Different tools for different contexts.\n\nSome things Charlotte does that Playwright MCP doesn't:\n\n* Three detail levels (agents choose context depth per call)\n* Landmark-grouped interactive summaries (minimal shows \"main: 1847 links, 3 buttons\" instead of listing all 1847)\n* Stable hash-based element IDs that survive DOM mutations\n* Structural diffing between page states\n* Semantic find by element type, text, or landmark\n* Built-in basic accessibility, SEO, and contrast audits\n* Local dev server with hot reload\n\nOne thing I'm proud of: Charlotte's own marketing site was built and verified entirely by an agent using Charlotte as its tool. The agent served the site locally with `dev_serve`, checked layouts with `screenshot`, tested interactive elements with `find` and `click`, caught a mobile overflow bug by reading bounding boxes, and fixed 16 unlabeled SVG icons, all without a human looking at the page.\n\nMIT licensed, published on npm, listed in the MCP registry.\n\n* **GitHub:** [https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte](https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte)\n* **npm:** [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ticktockbent/charlotte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ticktockbent/charlotte)\n* **Site:** [https://charlotte-rose.vercel.app](https://charlotte-rose.vercel.app)\n* **Benchmarks:** [https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte/blob/main/docs/charlotte-benchmark-report.md](https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte/blob/main/docs/charlotte-benchmark-report.md)\n* **Raw Results:** [https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte/tree/main/benchmarks/results/raw](https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte/tree/main/benchmarks/results/raw)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the architecture, the benchmarks, or anything else. I'd love for people to try it and tell me what breaks.",

              "text": "Okay I went and tested this. Here's the quick version:\n\nShadow DOM works well. I had an agent test against charlotte's own github repo which has 26 shadow hosts (`<tool-tip>` elements (styled tooltips) and `<relative-time>` elements rendering text like \"17 hours ago\" in their shadow roots). Charlotte handled these all correctly. The AX tree extraction picked up the rendered content without any special handling and captured all interactive elements, labels, and text from the shadow DOM components.\n\nIframes did not go so well. I tested against a [w3schools.com](http://w3schools.com) page which has 5 embedded iframes including a same-origin one embedding a full tutorial page. None of the iframe content was captured because `Accessibility.getFullAXTree` operates on the main frame's accessibility tree only. Iframe content lives in a separate frame/process. I've added iframe handling to my roadmap and I think I could handle it by calling `Accessibility.getFullAXTree` for each frame target via CDP and merging the results into the main representation. That'd be a non-trivial feature addition though so it may take some time to get working properly.\n\nGood question! I wouldn't have tested this today otherwise.",

It's changed a lot!\n\nIf you're planning to use a Claude-based workflow for your admin panel, Charlotte gives Claude the ability to see and interact with web pages. You add a config block to Claude Desktop or Claude Code, and Claude can browse your app like a user would.\n\nFor your admin panel: you build a page, tell Claude \"serve my project and check if the forms work on mobile,\" and Charlotte handles the rest, serves your files, switches to a mobile viewport, finds the forms, tests them, and reports back what happened. No test scripts, no selectors, just describe what you want checked. That's the part I've been enjoying the most, I describe my tests in natural language and the agent uses tool calls through the MCP. I used to waste so much time on playwright scripts...\n\nIt can see differences when states change, like testing whether dark mode affects all of the expected components or whatever, and can see when elements are misaligned or review a screenshot to make sure effects are applied correctly.",

Navigate defaults to minimal, so the agent's first view of any page is just landmarks, headings, and interactive summaries (element counts grouped by landmark). From there it decides whether to call find to locate specific elements or observe at a higher detail level. There's no separate planning step because the detail levels are the planning mechanism. The agent never pays for full page detail unless it explicitly asks for it.\n\nIf your agent needs full context you can run in summary or full to pull more data initially or on subsequent tool calls while saving tokens where it's not as important. I use it in concert with some custom skills that help the model judge what detail level to use for different situations.",

But if a button's label text actually changes, that generates a new hash. That's intentional! If the label changed, it's a different element from the agent's perspective. I haven't stress-tested against heavy SPA dashboards with constant dynamic updates though, that's a great edge case to push on. I might give it a try in my next benchmark runs. If you try it and find something that breaks, I'd love to hear about it.\n\nMy reasoning for the design I've gone with is that I built Charlotte mostly as a testing tool for myself.
