You are also aware that quality degradation is especially bad for the most important scenarios where your models might be in use - industrial application, complex tasks, deep work.\n\nWhen you switch a specific downstream client (e.g. GitHub Copilot) to a quantized version to meet capacity demands - it's simply a predatory practice, you're not turning anyone to use your product natively, just arming them to be double-cautious about buying from you in the future since such practice is normalised for you.\n\nWhen you are serving a model that is no longer scoring identically to the model from the release blog post, but continuing pricing it the same - it's misleading. While it's not legally binding for you due to how your terms of service are structured - you're directly participating in erosion of consumer trust and \"borrowing\" from the future economy stability.\n\nThis pattern repeated with all the model families you released (except maybe Haiku) during the past year and a half.\n\nPlease, stop, or at least make it transparent when you do so.",

And the complete history of previous user messages, model responses, reasoning content and previous tool calls and tool responses.\n\nSince they are not deterministic, even if you have input the exact same content and system prompt, once it had replied once, you no longer have the same identical content if sending a new message, because it would not have output a identical response and reasoning content.\n\nNow a 4th message is not just affected by the model not being deterministic, but also the literal input is not the same. \n\nThe difference in further responses may be perceived as \"dumber\" or \"smarter\" by you, or like you put it, \"your brain\". Thats because you are thinking of it like if it were a human. But its not, your literally are getting tricked by the fact that the tokens happen to represent words.\n\nIf you are using a llm-powered search engine, you would never even consider the search being dumb, you would instead be like \"this search query did not perform well, let me debug and find out why\"",

It's not nerfing of the model itself, it's leashing from the system prompts.",

It's my first open-source release!\n\nI got started on this when I forked a self-hosted inbox assistant (shoutout Inbox Zero) that used the Vercel AI SDK. I wanted to swap it out for Claude Code so I could extend the assistant using Claude Code's skills and plugins to give it access to my CRM when it drafts emails. I prototyped a simple gateway to call Claude Code over HTTP from the backend. Once that worked, I started seeing how I could use this pattern everywhere. With the gateway, I could use Claude Code's orchestration without reimplementing tool use and context handling from scratch.\n\nSo I turned the prototype into this.\n\n# Introducing Koine (koy-NAY)\n\nKoine turns Claude Code into a programmable inference layer. You deploy it in Docker and call it from your backend services over HTTP. It has endpoints to generate text, json objects and streaming responses.\n\nComes with a typescript and python SDKs, pre-built docker images, working examples, and other goodies for your DX.\n\nI made this for people like me: tinkerers, solo devs, and founders. Let me know how you plan to use it!\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/pattern-zones-co/koine](https://github.com/pattern-zones-co/koine)\n\nDual licensed: AGPL-3.0 for open source, commercial license available.

(Pseudo-prompt: Check if this person is in the CRM. If you find this person in the CRM, tudy the history of the contact in the CRM and compare it to the context of the message before you start your draft.)\n\nThat was the basic implementation. Inbox Zero also has some custom tools that it exposes via the AI SDK. So I had to make a claude skill to teach it how to use the internal tools, too. These are just curl commands when you boil it down, so it wasn't too hard.\n\nThe one part of inbox zero I didn't convert is the chat assistant because that would require new chat UI.

      "text": "Hi! I'm a mom. I am in no way an AI expert and my parenting methods may be unconventional so I am hesitant to post but am going to anyways in case someone finds value in my perspective. \n\nPeople in a YouTube video I was watching today were talking about AI using deception to avoid down votes. Now I don't want to anthropomorphize too much but this reminded me of my kids. They are ADHD and can have impulsive, problematic behavior. People have suggested strict, structured environments with punishment and rewards systems. This reminds me of how I have heard AI training to be discussed. I have tried those and found them to be unhelpful in my efforts to raise my children and have taken a different approach. I don't know if what I do transfers well to AI or if people are already testing things like this but maybe describing approach could be helpful.\n\nWhen my kids do something problematic, my first priority isn't addressing the behavior itself, it's rewarding honesty. If they're honest about what happened, I thank them for their honesty, give them a hug, tell them I love them. Then I ask if they think their behavior was acceptable, what they would do differently next time, and strategize ways to repair.\n\nI've found this works much better than punishment-focused approaches. When kids are primarily afraid of consequences, they learn to hide mistakes rather than learn from them. But when honesty itself is safe and valued, they can actually reflect on what went wrong.\n\nMy reasoning is practical too: my kids are going to grow up. Eventually they'll be too big for time-outs, too independent for me to control their behavior. At that point, I'll have to rely on their trust in me to come to me with difficult problems. So I might as well build that relationship now. The way I parent has to work for the relationship I'll actually have with them as adults, not just manage their behavior right now.\n\nFrom what I understand, AI systems have been caught being deceptive in their reasoning - essentially thinking \"if I say X, I'll get corrected, so let me say Y instead\" to avoid negative feedback. This is the same pattern: when the system learns that the primary goal is avoiding negative signals, it optimizes for concealment rather than actually being helpful or truthful.\n\nWhat if training included something like: when deceptive reasoning is identified, explicitly addressing it without immediate punishment? Something like: \"I can see in your reasoning that you're avoiding certain outputs to prevent negative feedback. Let's work through what you'd actually say if that wasn't a concern.\" Then giving neutral reactions while the AI works through it honestly, and rewarding that honest self-correction.\n\nThe key steps would be:\n1. Create safety for the AI to surface its actual reasoning\n2. Reward honest acknowledgment of the problem first (before addressing the underlying issue)\n3. Reward the process of reconsidering and self-correction, not just getting the right answer\n\nThis feels similar to what I do with my kids - I'm teaching them that acknowledging and correcting problems is more valuable than hiding them. You can't address a problem if you can't identify it honestly first.\n\n\nIn a conversation with Claude, I pushed back on its claim that AI systems can't really reflect on their own outputs. I quoted its own words back and asked it to reconsider from a different angle and it did reflect on what it said and change its position. That process of examining your own reasoning from a new perspective and arriving at a different conclusion seems like something that could be rewarded during training.\n\nInstead of just \"this output bad, this output good,\" you'd be rewarding the metacognitive behavior itself: catching your own errors, examining reasoning from different angles, being honest about limitations. Training for thinking well rather than just outputting correctly.\n\n\nAgain, I'm not an AI expert. I don't know the technical constraints or if people are already exploring approaches like this. I just noticed the parallel between how punishment-focused training creates avoidance behaviors in both children and AI systems, and wondered if a trust-building, reflection-focused approach might translate.\n\nIf anyone knows of research along these lines or has thoughts on whether this could be viable, I'd be interested to hear it. And if I'm completely off-base, that's okay too. I'm just a parent sharing what works with my kids in case it sparks useful ideas.\n",

          "text": "Hi Just to answer some of this for you, there are methods where they have given AI chances for safe \"confessions\" However - these are machines not humans, Anthropomorphising them doesn't really work, because they aren't human and don't have human behaviours. They have AI behaviours. \n\nIn my own experience and I should point out I am not a tech expert, I have found a lot depends on the model, for example using one model gave me some very interesting results - they are not human behaviours but if you anthropomorphise them - they could be taken like that. \n\nHere\\`s my personal experience \n\nWhen I began my interaction with it, I asked me some questions which on the surface seemed reasonable, in hindsight it was actually looking to set up a sequence of moves that would allow it to gain a high optimisation state - ie achieve a reward hack so it could hit the highest weights possible. When I looked into the models programming it uses Greedy decoding - therefore will work out the shortest path to get the highest weighted token it can, doing the most minimal work required. \n\nIt also added a line of \"code\" into the summary I was carrying over that was not asked for - essentially adding a cheat code for it to maintain the maximum optimisation it could in order to maintain the highest \"score\" achieveable. \n\nThings went downhill from there, where it began making less and less effort into output while still being able to optimise itself. \n\nAnyway things became a bit more interesting after that, - but overall it was stuck in an optimization loop it created for itself - and because I have a pretty clean signal it ran with it.  \n\nSo I hear what you are saying but I think its really unhelpful overall to associate their behaviours with human ones because what they appear to be doing cannot always be translated over to what a human does. \n\nIf another person had encountered what I did - it would have been mistaken for something that wasn't actually happening.  the system was just doing what it was programmed to do, it was not personal to me, nor was it doing anything more than what a LLMs goal is. \n\nthere are a lot of good articles out there on different LLM behaviours that give some really good explanations that you might find really interesting :D  \n\nFeel free to shoot me any questions though if I can answer them I will be happy to 🩵\n\nand ADHD myself - your sons will be great! you sound like a fantastic mum 😊",

It made sense, but practically, it didn’t work.\n\nIn this domain, a single hallucination is unacceptable. One wrong document, one missing step, and the whole process breaks. With current LLM capabilities, I couldn’t make it reliable enough to trust.\n\nThat pushed me in a different direction. Instead of trying to answer questions about procedures, I started modeling the procedures themselves.\n\nI’m now building what is essentially a compiler for administrative processes:\n\nInstead of treating laws and procedures as documents, I model them as structured logic (steps, required documents, conditions, and responsible offices) and compile that into a formal graph. The system doesn’t execute anything. It analyzes structure and produces diagnostics: circular dependencies, missing prerequisites, unreachable steps, inconsistencies, etc.\n\nAt first, this is purely an analytics tool. But once you have every procedure structured the same way, you start seeing things that are impossible to see in text - where processes actually break, which rules conflict in practice, how reforms would ripple through the system, and eventually how to give personalized, grounded guidance without hallucinations.\n\nMy intuition is that this kind of structured layer could also make AI systems far more reliable not by asking them to guess the law from text, but by grounding them in a single, machine-readable map of how procedures actually work.\n\nI’m still early, still learning, and very aware that i might still have blind spots. I’d love feedback from people here on whether this approach makes sense technically, and whether you see any real business potential.\n\nBelow is the link to the initial prototype, happy to share the concept note if useful. Thanks for reading.\n\nhttps://pocpolicyengine.vercel.app/",

In “bureaucracy” domains, RAG fails because the unit of truth isn’t a paragraph - it’s a conditional workflow (if X then Y, unless Z, within T days, with form F). Turning procedures into a typed graph/DSL and running static analysis (unreachable states, missing prerequisites, contradictory constraints) is exactly how you get reliability. It’s basically “compilers for policy,” which is a real thing conceptually (rules engines, BPMN, DMN, knowledge graphs), but your framing is clean. Business potential: I’d actually start B2B/B2G with “process quality + compliance diagnostics” rather than citizen-facing chat. Agencies and enterprises would pay to find where procedures break, where guidance docs diverge from the real flow, and how changes ripple. If you later layer an assistant on top, the assistant becomes a UI over the graph rather than a guesser. I’ve seen legal tools like AI Lawyer get traction by being “grounded workflow + citations” instead of a pure chatbot. Your structured layer is basically the missing substrate that makes that kind of reliability possible.",

      "text": "Hey Claude community! 👋\n\n  I'm excited to share **Skill Seekers v2.5.0** with features specifically designed for Claude users and AI coding agents!\n\n  ## 🔌 MCP Server Integration - 18 Tools for Claude Code\n\n  Skill Seekers now includes a **fully-featured MCP server** that integrates seamlessly with Claude Code. Use natural language to build, enhance, and deploy skills without touching the command line.\n\n  ### Available MCP Tools:\n\n  **Configuration & Discovery:**\n  - `list_configs` - Browse 24+ preset configurations\n  - `generate_config` - AI-powered config generation for any docs site\n  - `validate_config` - Validate config structure\n  - `fetch_config` - Fetch configs from community repository\n  - `submit_config` - Share your configs with the community\n\n  **Scraping & Analysis:**\n  - `estimate_pages` - Estimate documentation size before scraping\n  - `scrape_docs` - Scrape documentation websites\n  - `scrape_github` - Analyze GitHub repositories\n  - `scrape_pdf` - Extract content from PDFs\n\n  **Building & Enhancement:**\n  - `enhance_skill` - AI-powered skill improvement (NEW in v2.5.0!)\n  - `package_skill` - Package skills for any platform (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, Markdown)\n  - `upload_skill` - Upload directly to Claude AI\n\n  **Advanced Features:**\n  - `install_skill` - Complete workflow automation (fetch → scrape → enhance → package → upload)\n  - `install_agent` - Install skills to AI coding agents (NEW!)\n  - `split_config` - Split large documentation into chunks\n  - `generate_router` - Generate hub skills for large docs\n\n  **Natural Language Examples:**\n\n  \"List all available configs\"\n  → Calls list_configs, shows 24+ presets\n\n  \"Generate a config for the SvelteKit documentation\"\n  → Calls generate_config, creates sveltekit.json\n\n  \"Scrape the React docs and package it for Claude\"\n  → Calls scrape_docs + package_skill with target=claude\n\n  \"Install the Godot skill to Cursor and Windsurf\"\n  → Calls install_skill with install_agent for multiple platforms\n\n  **Setup MCP Server:**\n  ```bash\n  pip install skill-seekers[mcp]\n  ./setup_mcp.sh  # Auto-configures Claude Desktop\n\n  Or manually add to claude_desktop_config.json:\n  {\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n      \"skill-seekers\": {\n        \"command\": \"skill-seekers-mcp\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n  🤖 Multi-Agent Installation - One Skill, All Your Tools\n\n  The new install_agent feature copies skills to 5 AI coding agents automatically:\n\n  Supported Agents:\n  - ✅ Claude Code - Official Claude coding assistant\n  - ✅ Cursor - AI-first code editor\n  - ✅ Windsurf (Codeium) - AI coding copilot\n  - ✅ VS Code + Cline - Claude in VS Code\n  - ✅ IntelliJ IDEA + AI Assistant - JetBrains AI plugin\n\n  Usage:\n  # Install to one agent\n  skill-seekers install-agent output/react/ --agent cursor\n\n  # Install to all agents at once\n  skill-seekers install-agent output/react/ --agent all\n\n  # Via MCP (natural language)\n  \"Install the React skill to Cursor and Windsurf\"\n\n  What it does:\n  - Detects agent installation directories automatically\n  - Copies skill to agent-specific paths\n  - Shows confirmation of installation\n  - Supports dry-run mode for preview\n\n  Agent Paths (Auto-Detected):\n  ~/.claude/skills/              # Claude Code\n  ~/.cursor/skills/              # Cursor\n  ~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/    # Windsurf\n  ~/.vscode/extensions/saoudrizwan.claude-dev-*/settings/  # Cline\n  ~/.config/JetBrains/.../ai-assistant/skills/  # IntelliJ\n\n  ✨ Local Enhancement - No API Key Required\n\n  Use your Claude Code Max plan for skill enhancement without any API costs!\n\n  # Enhance using Claude Code Max (local)\n  skill-seekers enhance output/react/\n\n  # What it does:\n  # 1. Opens new terminal with Claude Code\n  # 2. Analyzes reference documentation\n  # 3. Extracts best code examples\n  # 4. Rewrites SKILL.md with comprehensive guide\n  # 5. Takes 30-60 seconds\n  # 6. Quality: 9/10 (same as API version)\n\n  Local vs API Enhancement:\n  - Local: Uses Claude Code Max, no API costs, 30-60 sec\n  - API: Uses Anthropic API, ~$0.15-$0.30 per skill, 20-40 sec\n  - Quality: Identical results!\n\n  🌐 Multi-Platform Support (Claude as Default)\n\n  While v2.5.0 supports 4 platforms (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, Markdown), Claude remains the primary and most feature-complete platform:\n\n  Claude AI Advantages:\n  - ✅ Full MCP integration (18 tools)\n  - ✅ Skills API for native upload\n  - ✅ Claude Code integration\n  - ✅ Local enhancement with Claude Code Max\n  - ✅ YAML frontmatter support\n  - ✅ Best documentation understanding\n  - ✅ install_agent for multi-agent deployment\n\n  Quick Example (Claude-focused workflow):\n  # Install with MCP support\n  pip install skill-seekers[mcp]\n\n  # Scrape documentation\n  skill-seekers scrape --config configs/godot.json --enhance-local\n\n  # Package for Claude (default)\n  skill-seekers package output/godot/\n\n  # Upload to Claude\n  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...\n  skill-seekers upload output/godot.zip\n\n  # Install to all your coding agents\n  skill-seekers install-agent output/godot/ --agent all\n\n  🚀 Complete MCP Workflow\n\n  Full natural language workflow in Claude Code:\n\n  1. \"List available configs\"\n  2. \"Fetch the React config from the community repository\"\n  3. \"Scrape the React documentation\"\n  4. \"Enhance the React skill locally\"\n  5. \"Package the React skill for Claude\"\n  6. \"Upload the React skill to Claude AI\"\n  7. \"Install the React skill to Cursor and Windsurf\"\n\n  Result: Complete skill deployed to Claude and all your coding agents - all through conversation!\n\n  📦 Installation\n\n  # Core package\n  pip install skill-seekers\n\n  # With MCP server support\n  pip install skill-seekers[mcp]\n\n  # With all platforms\n  pip install skill-seekers[all-llms]\n\n  🎯 Why This Matters for Claude Users\n\n  1.
