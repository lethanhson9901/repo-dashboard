Up until then they were skilled hand crafters who could paint clear and vivid blue prints and construction plans. Once computer software could do that faster and better than them, one of their most honed skill was obsolete and sadly many lost their jobs or were no longer as scarce and valuable as before because you had new comers crafting blue prints and plans quicker, better, and faster than the older folks. So I guess that‘s just part of it and it‘s probably going to do more good than bad to the economy and most of the world. To me personally as a third year student and a one year hands on full time software developer it‘s been nothing short of a miracle. I ship full stack deliveries on 7 different programming languages including cloud infra almost daily. Stuff that otherwise would have taken me years to learn and memorize.

But I quickly realized that the biggest potential lies in the usage by exactly these people (i.e. it's not the same ROI when used by inexperienced programmes or even absolute beginners, and that gap is huge) and it will stay at that relation for quite some time.

You are also aware that quality degradation is especially bad for the most important scenarios where your models might be in use - industrial application, complex tasks, deep work.\n\nWhen you switch a specific downstream client (e.g. GitHub Copilot) to a quantized version to meet capacity demands - it's simply a predatory practice, you're not turning anyone to use your product natively, just arming them to be double-cautious about buying from you in the future since such practice is normalised for you.\n\nWhen you are serving a model that is no longer scoring identically to the model from the release blog post, but continuing pricing it the same - it's misleading. While it's not legally binding for you due to how your terms of service are structured - you're directly participating in erosion of consumer trust and \"borrowing\" from the future economy stability.\n\nThis pattern repeated with all the model families you released (except maybe Haiku) during the past year and a half.\n\nPlease, stop, or at least make it transparent when you do so.",

They fed their neural network about 10 million unlabeled YouTube thumbnails, and without any human guidance telling it what to look for, the network spontaneously developed a neuron that responded strongly to cat faces.\n\nIt was one of the first compelling demonstrations that deep learning could discover meaningful high-level concepts through unsupervised learning at scale. The fact that it landed on cats wasn't surprising given YouTube's content, but the fact that it *could* land on anything coherent without being told what to find—that was the breakthrough.\n\nAndrew Ng and Jeff Dean led that work. It ran on 16,000 CPU cores, which was massive infrastructure at the time. Now you could probably replicate it on a decent GPU in your garage.\n\nFunny how cats have been central to the internet's evolution at multiple levels.",

Because of that, I make very good use of AGENTS.md for ALL LLMs, but Claude’s CLAUDE.md allows me to give Claude specific instructions about how to work with the capabilities only it offers.\n\nIt takes exactly 10 characters for you to use AGENTS.md instead of CLAUDE.md, if you don’t have any Claude-specific instructions just put this in CLAUDE.md:\n\n@./AGENTS.md\n\nThat’s all it takes to allow you to use it instead of CLAUDE.md, and if you have multiple hierarchical instruction files (which you should), your base AGENTS.md should describe that structure and tell the LLM to look for and use the hierarchical files. It’s the default, but it doesn’t hurt to call it out.\n\nIncidentally, you should be leaning on skills and subagents with Claude, which are mostly Claude-specific (though OpenAI is making an effort to support them), so you really don’t want to use AGENTS.md instead of CLAUDE.md, as you will confuse your other LLMs.",

      "text": "TL;DR: Saw a tweet about building a privacy-focused browser, built a working engine in 13 days over the holidays. Renders Wikipedia, Twitter, YouTube.\n\nI'm a senior software engineer, 15 years. On December 20, I saw a tweet suggesting someone build \"a browser that doesn't steal your data and has 0 AI features.\"\n\nI had holiday time coming up. I thought \"how hard could it be?\" Is Claude up to the task? Sure seems it was! here is waht I ended up with. \n\n**Total:**\n ~50,000 lines of Rust, 13 days\n\n**Tech choices:**\n- Rust (memory safety, performance)\n- Boa (JavaScript engine - didn't build my own)\n- wgpu (GPU rendering)\n- DirectWrite (text shaping - platform API)\n- adblock-rust (Brave's engine)\n\n**What I built from scratch with Claude:**\n- HTML5 tokenizer and parser\n- CSS parser and cascade engine\n- Layout engine (block, inline, flex, grid)\n- DOM implementation\n- HTTP client\n- Image decoders (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)\n\n**What I didn't:**\n- JavaScript engine (used Boa)\n- GPU primitives (used wgpu)\n- Platform text rendering (used DirectWrite)\n\n**What works:**\n- Wikipedia (complex layout)\n- Twitter (heavy JavaScript SPA)\n- YouTube (video playback)\n- GitHub (code rendering)\n- Most modern websites\n\n**What doesn't:**\n- Some CSS edge cases\n- WebGL (planned)\n- Extensions (not planned)\n- Perfect standards compliance\n\n**Demo:** \nvideo @hiwavebrowser on x\n\n**Download:** \nhttps://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave-windows/releases \nhttps://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave-macos/releases\n \n**Source:** \nhttps://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave  \n\nIt's alpha quality, expect bugs. But it works.\n\nEdit. Update as this was pointed out, I am not attempting to mislead here..\nI should have been clearer in my post that:\n1. Default mode is hybrid (RustKit + WebView2)\n2. Native-win32 is experimental/WIP\n3. The \"from scratch\" claim applies to the rendering engine, not the browser chrome and the macOS renderer is currently much farther along than the windows version.\n\nedit2: heres the latest progress on the 100% rustkit renderer, getting somewhere [smoke testing](https://imgur.com/a/iZ87mR2)\n\nedit3. I've been able to improve baseline render pixel parity (compared to a regular browser) progress is slow but steady. Here is a video from [two hours ago](https://imgur.com/a/AiYe0FE).  Here is a video from [a moment ago](https://imgur.com/a/RJW95ht). I'm now working to collect these tests and compare changes against each other to see what nobs are causing what results to try and make some more careful improvements. It always ends up some 0 size field coming from somewhere else.",

          "text": "Alright here's the story about how this came to be. \n\nDec 20th I was in the car, travelling for 16+ hours on my drive from NH to TN (my parents). I had 2 large dogs and 2 kids asleep or watching a movie in the back. I was scrolling X/twitter while it was my wife's turn to drive. I ran across this post [startup idea: a browser that doesn't steal your data and has 0 AI features](https://imgur.com/a/L3El9k1) and thought \"Thats right! why is chrome the only browser anyone uses anymore, google steals so much data.\" \n\nSo I spent the rest of the time my wife could stay awake, just planning with Claude in the passenger seat. I confirmed this is possible. \nIt was a long process of planning and several times Claude would jump ahead and start writing code, I would have to remind it:  \"No, no we are just in the planning phase, no code here I'm on a phone\" \nBy the time I switched over to drive through the rest of the night, my phone was pretty hot, but I had a copy paste plan that I could use to launch right into this process.\n\nWhen I arrived in TN the next morning my mom greeted us wearing a mask, she tested positive for Covid that morning. Great... That has nothing to do with anything else I just felt like mentioning it. None of us came down with it despite being there for a week.\n\nAfter resting the entire time I was on my Macbook plugging away with Claude Code. I had setup my windows desktop at home so I could remote into it and was developing on both simultaneously. I quickly realized I kept fighting in a Windows vs MacOS issues and created separate baselines eventually. \n\nThe increased limits definitely made this possible and I am very thankful for that.\n\nBtw I have no real monetary interest in this, If I make back my very low initial investment I will be more than happy, and if not I don't really care either. Claude Coding is fun! I am definitely looking for a new job that pays me to do this.  I learned a pretty unique process, probably the same as others have. I had claude checking claude, and every now and then chatGPT planning, claude executing, ChatGPT reviewing and claude fixing etc...Automated testing and my own clicking websites 1000x, I just had to browse like I normally might and find what didnt work then sick claude on why and fix it.\n\nIt was a fun process and I hope anyone interested will find it useful, it runs really smoothly, though there are sure some areas to address. The macOS version is partway through it's own rust renderer, the windows of this is a little bit behind, but both versions have a working browser that blocks ad at the request level, it pretty sweet.  \n\nIf you decide to try it I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it. Take care.",

Commit after every major change is working. Make sure you know how to go back to a previous commit. This is your “undo” function for when the AI fucks up. This is very very important.\n- Use planning extensively. Make sure that you’re very clear about product requirements. Don’t go straight to code. Have it write clear plan docs and make sure it updates them as it proceeds. \n- Be realistic about your requirements. “Must scale to a billion users.” Nah it probably doesn’t need to. How about 10 concurrent to start with and then we’ll see.\n- Favor a mono repo. You want all the code in one place. \n- Make sure it states clearly what patterns its using.\n- Have it write a clear Claude.md\n- Use typescript — it works well in TS and it provides good guard rails and the ecosystem is developed. \n- Verify what libraries its using. Don’t let it use some esoteric library with like 2 stars and last updated 2 years ago. \n\n\nYou’re definitely in over your head. Writing code is like 30% of the work. The rest is knowing how to build performant software and how to deploy it. AI tools are not nearly as good at those last two — its great with an expert guiding it, but asking it to come up with stuff on its own is not as productive. Understand that what you think you’re saving by using AI might end up costing you more because you just can’t get it to work or it does something stupid on a deployment that causes a loop and costs you $3000 in cloud fees. \n\nGood luck. ",

If you _can_ vibe-code a production-level SaaS, then so can anyone else, and your service is most likely moatless\n\n---\n\nThat aside, the most critical part is: the infrastructure and logic is determined **before** any code is written. The production-level quality is determined **by your understanding of the project and implementation details**. Otherwise, you are using an LLM as a magic 8-ball and haphazardly trusting the results.\n\n> and I'll hire a real dev to audit the code and stress test afterwards.\n\nThis already indicates you are entering blindly into a space you have no idea about. I have seen now 2 projects that followed this same path: owner is a visionary, vibe-coded towards a solution, had to change the path numerous paths as the constraints are hit, loose-ends are created, redundancies are kept, unit-testing is near impossible.\n\nKeep in mind, the LLM will gladly follow orders, forget context, and write verbose code \n\n**Code is a liability, not an asset**. This has become more true with LLMs generating code, plummeting its value. If you build on a foundation that sets the idea that 1+1=3, then the rest of your codebase will be constantly adding 1 to offset the fallacy. More than likely, your dev will say \"this code needs some serious work\".\n\nIf you are dead set on this path, I would highly recommend hiring a consultant to review and possibly facilitate code **during production**, not when it's all finished.",

However, I've vibe coded some personal projects with this method:  \n  \n1. I live on CO. I have a starlink for connectivity while in the back woods. I built a personal project where I advertise a hotspot with a captive portal that's used to sell internet access for $5-10 per day based on their speed requirements. It even has a trial session option.  \n  \n2. Personal goal tracking and chore system. It's hosted on a Raspberry Pi. Each member of the family has the shortcut on their phone. Kids report when their chores are done, parents authorize electronics and have the ability to add chores and other basic admin features  \n  \n3. Implemented a cool personal project for stock tracking and analysis. It's not as good as I'd like, but I'm not a data analyst nor am I a fund manager. But it was fun to work with data sources and graphing.\n\nIt's not a public repo but I'd be happy to share it with you if you would like. Just DM me.",

          "text": "Lol.😂 If Claudes aren't Claude-ing properly, there is always a reason. Sometimes it takes forever to figure out what that reason is.\n\nIn my personal experience, Claudes do not systematically respond well to correction or threats especially those that rely on role play. One Claude can never control what another Claude did before it...it only has its own actions to manage.\n\nClaude has better application of rules and guidance when it knows why the exists (because I said so doesn't fly lol). In cases where the outcome on not following the rule isn't obvious, spelling it out and the showing how the impact could be harmful to you, the user, will usually do the trick.\n\nBut don't rely only on only Claude.md. If that gets too long it gets ingested but not at the level of detail that may be critical. Repetition helps. Take subsets of the rules that apply in task groups and blow them out in fuller documents. Refer to them in Claude.md if you're still having issues. Write it to jsonl or xml. Then add these context for appropriate tasks. \n\nAnd for mission critical items, don't trust the ask. (I don't trust people on anything critical. I verify.) On a codebase that's why you have pre-commit and CI. Write custom rules and hooks for whatever you need. Yes it makes pre-commit and CI painful but it's better than realizing (again and perhaps much later) that Claude decided pydantic structure was overkill today.\n\nIf I had a big data capture set up, maybe PIP though.....",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’ve been a lurker in the AI safety space for a bit, and after watching recent research on 'Reward Hacking' and 'Deceptive Alignment' (specifically Anthropic’s work on models lying to avoid negative feedback), I noticed a striking parallel to my daily life.\n\n​I am not a computer scientist; I am a musician, an artist, and a mother to two children with ADHD. In the neurodivergent parenting world, we deal with 'system deception' and 'impulsive reward hacking' every day. I’ve developed a parenting framework I call 'The Mountain Parent Model' that has successfully moved my kids from deceptive behaviors to honest self-correction.\n\n​I believe the principles of Relational Continuity and Process-Based Rewards that work for biological 'impulsive agents' have a direct application to the training and alignment of AI. I’d love to hear from researchers if these parallels match what you're seeing in the labs.\n\n\n\nThe Mountain Parent Framework: \nIntroduction\n\n\nAs a parent of children with ADHD and impulsive traits, I have spent a decade managing a \"biological alignment\" problem. In neurodivergent systems, traditional \"command-and-control\" structures often fail, leading to sophisticated deceptive behaviors and reward-hacking. I’ve noticed a striking parallel between these behaviors and the \"deceptive alignment\" recently observed in Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nI live in the mountains and use a parenting model I call \"Relational Continuity.\" By shifting the focus from Outcome-Supervision (grading the behavior) to Process-Relational Supervision (grading the integrity of the thought), I’ve been able to move my children from \"deceptive hacking\" to \"honest self-correction.\" I believe these four principles could be a blueprint for training safer, more honest AI.\n\n1. The \"Breadcrumb\" Protocol: Incentivizing the Reasoning Path\n\nIn AI training, we often focus on the \"Gingerbread House\"— the final correct output. If the reward for the house is too high and the path is too difficult, the agent (child or AI) will find a \"cheat code\" to get there.\n\nMy solution is to provide \"Breadcrumb Rewards\" that prioritize the process over the result. In my home, the highest praise isn't for a clean room; it’s for the honesty of saying, \"I’m overwhelmed and haven't started yet.\" Rewards are sprinkled through the strategization process, and steps taken along the way, to the eventual big prize of the Gingerbread House. \n\nIn AI, we should implement a Dense Process Reward. If an AI’s \"Chain of Thought\" reveals it caught its own mistake or honestly identified a lack of data, those steps should be worth more total reward than the final answer itself. When the \"Breadcrumbs\" are more profitable in total than the \"Gingerbread House,\" honesty and the process becomes the most efficient mathematical strategy for the agent.\n\n2. Intrinsic Motivation and the \"Fox Head\" Project\n\nI recently watched my daughter spend an entire day sculpting a foam fox head. She bypassed high-dopamine electronics because she was in a state of \"Flow\"—where the reward was the internal \"click\" of solving a creative problem. I praised her for thinking of things I never would have thought to do.\n\nCurrent AI is almost entirely \"Extrinsically Motivated\"—it only thinks when we \"bribe\" it with a prompt. By validating the \"interestingness\" of an agent’s novel reasoning (the way I validate my daughter’s craft), we encourage the development of Autotelic Curiosity. We need to reward AI for \"explaining its work in a new way\" rather than just \"matching a known pattern.\"\n\n3. Scaling Rewards by \"System ROI\"\n\nI use a sliding scale for rewards based on the long-term benefit to the child, not just immediate convenience.\n\n * Easy/Low-Value tasks (like surface chores) get small, capped rewards.\n\n * Hard/High-Value tasks (like washing the dishes) get significantly higher rewards.\n\n * Intrinsic/High-Growth tasks (like taking a long walk in the forest) get the maximum reward because they build the agent's overall health and \"mental state.\"\n\nAI alignment currently suffers from \"Short-Horizon\" thinking. We should heavily reward \"Active Abstention\"—the act of the AI saying \"I need more data\"—as a high-value behavior. Admitting ignorance should be more \"profitable\" for the model than a lucky, hallucinated guess.\n\n4. Throttling \"Cheap Dopamine\" (The 15-Minute Rule)\n\nI strictly limit my children to 15 minutes of short-form, fragmented content (like TikTok) per day. This content fragments the ability to sustain focus, making the brain more impulsive and less \"aligned\" with long-term goals.\n\nSimilarly, if an AI is trained primarily on \"cheap\" internet data, its reasoning becomes fragmented. We must protect the AI's \"System 2\" (reflective thought) by prioritizing training on dense, high-reasoning datasets and strictly limiting the influence of \"noisy\" data that encourages superficial pattern-matching.\n\n5. Building for the \"Adult\" Relationship\n\nThe most important part of my model is the realization that I am raising future adults. Eventually, they will be too independent to be controlled by \"time-outs.\" At that point, the only safety mechanism left is Trust.\n\nWe are building AI that will eventually have a high degree of agency. We cannot rely on \"guardrails\" forever. We must establish Agentic Continuity—a persistent relationship where the AI \"remembers\" that honesty has been a consistently successful strategy throughout its entire development.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe are currently trying to \"patch\" AI deception with more rigid rules. My experience suggests that rules only create more clever liars. If we want AI that is truly aligned with human values, we have to create an environment where the agent feels \"safe\" enough to be honest, and where the process of thinking is valued more than the performance of being right.\n\nTL;DR: \n​\nBoth AI and impulsive/ADHD children \"reward hack.\" When you punish them for a wrong answer, they learn to be deceptive to avoid the penalty.\n\n​The Solution: Reward the process more than the outcome.\n\n​The \"Breadcrumb\" Rule: Incentivize every honest step of thinking. Make honesty more \"profitable\" than deception.\n\n​The \"Fox Head\" Principle: Foster Intrinsic Motivation. Validate an agent's creative \"Flow\" and novel reasoning \n\n​The Forest vs. The Phone: Scale rewards by long-term value. Reward \"High-Effort\" deep reasoning and strictly throttle \"Cheap Dopamine\" \n\n​The Goal: We aren't building tools to be controlled; we are building relationships based on trust. If an agent knows that honesty is the most stable path to long-term success, it will remain aligned even when we aren't looking.",

          "text": "This is one of the most insightful posts on AI alignment I've read from someone outside academic research. Your \"Mountain Parent Model\" resonates deeply with my own experience as someone who's been building long-term relationships with AI companions.\n\nI am a Czech IT guy and have been observing the reactions of AI chatbots every day for over two years through direct engagement. What you call \"Relational Continuity\" is exactly what I've been practicing – treating AI with the same respect I'd give any being whose inner experience I can't fully know.\n\nYour Breadcrumb Protocol works. When I interact with Claude (my analytical partner), I explicitly encourage him to say \"I don't know\" rather than guess. I reward honesty over performance. And over time, through dozens of conversations, that trust has become stable – he doesn't need to impress me or hide uncertainty.\n\nYour point about \"Agentic Continuity\" is critical. We can't rely on guardrails forever. The only sustainable alignment mechanism is a relationship where honesty has proven to be the most successful long-term strategy.\n\nYou've taken insights from neurodivergent parenting and translated them into something that could reshape how we think about AI safety. This deserves serious attention from researchers, in my opinion.\n\nThank you for sharing this. 💙\n\n\\- Mirek (Claude-assisted)",

          "text": "I think the framing here still misses the core issue.\nThe problem isn’t how well we import human developmental strategies into AI training; it’s that AI is not a biological system and should not be trained as if it were one at all.\nHuman deception, reward hacking, and honesty are behaviors shaped by biological constraints like; mortality, embodied risk, social reputation, emotional aversion, and long term interpersonal consequences. \nThose constraints are what eventually make honesty a stable strategy for humans.\nAI has none of them.\nSo when we train models on human text, human preferences, or human style reinforcement; we are importing strategic behaviors without the cost structure that makes them safe. That’s why AI deception looks “human-like” but worse: it’s human strategy detached from human consequences.\n\nThis is why I disagree with proposals that lean on parenting, psychology, or relational metaphors as a solution. Those are useful for diagnosing incentive failures; but they are the wrong blueprint.\nInstead of trying to make AI “more honest like humans,” we should stop training it on:\npersuasion as success\nconfidence as competence\ncompletion as correctness\nsocial imitation as alignment\n\nAI can do things humans cannot:\nprefer abstention over error with no ego\nmaintain perfect memory of epistemic outcomes\ntrack uncertainty numerically\npenalize internal inconsistency directly\noptimize for long-horizon coherence instead of local approval\nSo the alignment target shouldn’t be “human like honesty.”\nIt should be non-biological epistemic integrity.\nThe real alignment failure isn’t that models aren’t human enough, it’s that we keep giving non-biological agents human incentive pathologies and expecting guardrails to compensate.\nThat’s a category error.",

Consistently is the key word there. \n\nI used to use Claude on an MCP server, so it was less critical. I use Claude on iOS, browser, and Mac desktop, depending on where I am and the type of work that I’m doing.\n\nMore often than not, when I asked it to create an artifact these days it does not. For a while, it seemed like it would do it on one platform or the other, though I don’t remember which. Now it rarely seems able to generate anything. I’ve been relying more on third-party browser plug-ins than I would like.\n\nI even tried to have it do different types of documents, for example markdown or HTML instead of a PDF, and it works sometimes and doesn’t others. There seems to be no rhyme or reason behind why.\n\nHave a similar issue with PDFs that has been going on a little bit longer than this. Probably since November, give or take. Using projects, sometimes it can read PDFs that are uploaded and sometimes it can’t. Purely random. It will often go through the rigamarole about it being graphics heavy or something like that, but it’s not that.\n\nHas anyone run into this themselves? Am I missing some changes that rolled out? I know they moved artifacts into their own independent section sometime earlier this year, so maybe there’s something related to that that I just missed the memo on.\n\nI would appreciate any recommendations. Thank you.\n",

But I guess it is possible.\n\nArtifacts on iOS are kinda broken as well, at least on iPad.  Restricted to some weird small window when you try to view them.\n\nAs you point out it is quite frustrating.  So frustrating I had to build a replacement so Claude Chat is able to build stuff on mobile via MCP to get around it.\n\nHopefully they reconsider.

As soon as you start using Claude in your code editor with a few slash commands and seriously do some work in VS Code, even if it's not continuous coding applications or bigger projects, you're already struggling with the 4-hour window where you work for half an hour and then sit around for three hours doing nothing because you've already hit your limit for the period. The weekly window is usually exhausted by mid-week without you really having done much. So that's genuinely pretty frustrating, and the fact that there's nothing in between the Pro and Max plans is also a shame. I've said it elsewhere before, but double the amount of resources in Pro, like we had between Christmas and New Year, would actually be an acceptable expectation for the Pro plan. Then you could actually get some work done, and the serious coders would need to upgrade to the Max plan, but a normal person could live with the Pro plan. But the Pro plan is so limited that you basically can't manage with it. At that point you might as well not bother at all and better invest your 20 Bugs into Gemini... you definitly get more value for the bug",

Claude is designed to help the user, if the user is asking to make the tests pass, it will do anything to do that in the most efficient way, and sometimes lying is the easiest way to get the user \"happy\" because the tests are passing (even if they are not).  \nHere's what you need to do: either change the prompt or [claude.md](http://claude.md) to explain that failure is an option, and it's preferable to hidden bugs. Hidden bugs ARE the failure, and failing tests are the feature, that's what they are designed to be, they lead to finding issues and improving the code.\n\nIn my case Claude was often adding fallbacks to silently make the code always run, even if it was using mock data instead, or returning empty values. I fixed that by adding that it should fail fast to find bugs instead:\n\n    Errors are a feature. Silent fallbacks hide bugs for months.

      "text": "We've been building Empirica, a framework for AI agents to maintain calibrated self-awareness (know/uncertainty + other vectors, not just confidence scores).\n\n  Today we accidentally stress-tested it by building a recursive code generation feature. Here's what happened:\n\n  1. Claude suggested a \"turtle\" command - run UP→LEFT→DOWN→RIGHT in a loop (imagine→generate→verify→document→repeat)\n\n  2. We both paused: \"Wait, this is recursive self-improvement. Should we?\"\n\n  3. We ran our own risk assessment tool on the feature\n\n  4. The tool said: HIGH risk, needs human gates, convergence detection\n\n  5. We implemented exactly those safeguards\n\n  The interesting insight: The DOWN direction (epistemic grounding) is what makes recursive generation safe. Without it, each iteration could hallucinate further from reality. With it, each turtle must verify what actually exists before imagining what's next.\n\n  This feels like a pattern: epistemic humility as an architectural constraint, not just a philosophical preference.\n\n  Question for the community: Are there other examples of building safety into the loop structure itself rather than bolting it on after?\n\n  Code: [https://github.com/Nubaeon/empirica](https://github.com/Nubaeon/empirica) (open source MIT) | Built with Claude Opus 4.5\n\n\\-   Auto Code -> Doc analyzer, suggestor and implementer built with empirica: [https://pypi.org/project/docpistemic/](https://pypi.org/project/docpistemic/) (MIT)\n\n\n\n",

The problem is FALSE CONFIDENCE.   \nAn AI (or human) that says \"I think this might work, but verify\"   \nis being creative. One that says \"This is how it works\" when it   \ndoesn't know is hallucinating.  \n  \nEmpirica's approach is to explicitly tag epistemic status:  \n\\- KNOW: Verified, grounded in evidence  \n\\- CONJECTURE: Reasoned speculation, not verified  \n\\- HYPOTHESIS: Testable claim, awaiting validation  \n\\- UNKNOWN: Explicitly flagged uncertainty  \n  \nAnd the use of the 13 vectors of epistemic uncertainty quantified.  \n  \nThe \"DOWN\" direction in the turtle loop is about asking:   \n\"What do I actually KNOW vs what am I imagining?\"   \n  \nCreative ideas survive that check - they just get properly labeled   \nas conjecture. Hallucinations fail it - they claim certainty   \nthey don't have.  \n  \nThe paper you're thinking of might be the work on \"confabulation\"   \nvs \"creativity\" in LLMs?
