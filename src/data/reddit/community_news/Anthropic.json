It asks me stuff, I choose my answer and then its like nope can't do. I correct it, it says it won't do it anymore because it wrote multiple versions already and tells me to use something else and when I get frustrated it says stop, are you fine, how is you doing mentally. What is this? Gaslighter 3000?! What is up with this horrible moralizing and accussatory and mean tone?! \"your list of rules keeps growing\" no, they stay the same, Sonnet 4.6 just ignores every single one of them.",

I say stop using \"said\", use synonyms instead, and it only ever uses \"said\". Give it my own reference file and it says it can't use it because of copyright. I work with mature text that contains some heavy themes, says it can't interact with such themes. I say I'm fine with the themes, that I am an adult and it's not triggering it to me, it says nope can't do, I'm uncomfortable with this. Refuses to analyze and interact with the text. I say use wide, diverse, uncommon wording, it uses the most simpletonic wording I have seen. It makes Grok look like absolute genius. What an utter hotdog water. And then it has the balls to scold me for wanting it to correct itself, \"engaging with files against its TOS\", copyright issues, and my tone and then asks me about my mental health lmao.

Even anatomical stuff, stuff regarding murder (I always made sure I put it into fictional context saying I don't plan to do anything wrong), the effects of drugs on body and mind, effects of trauma on person ie. generational incest, CSA, SA and such. And how would potential zombie/vampiric virus work. Sonnet 4.5 gave me lenghty and interesting ideas, discussed with me and even if it was hesitant to reply at first, it warmed up after it understood my intentions. Now it refuses completely. It feels like ChatGPT with the accussations and jumping to conclussions. I am not a killer and if I was, I technically could Google it, read a book, or ask AI how to kill an animal of certain size. I understand that there ARE people who would use AI for something like this. But I assume that even above average intelligent criminals wouldn't ask for these things. The same as we don't ban horror books because some crazy person might get \"inspired\" or violent video games. Idk why but Sonner 4.5 was able to understand the nuance and my intentions by speaking to me. Meanwhile 4.6 acts immediately as if I were to hurt someone and it's a very uncomfortable feeling. We don't punish entire community of coders for some bad apples who create viruses and malware, so why researchers and writing community? It just assumes I am asking to do something bad and its very weird and exactly how GPT became. I understand they want to avoid certain situations, but banning entire topics isn't the way! And I don't need LLM or AI company to moralize and judge my character or reach me right from wrong. They have no right to do that. \n\nI also had to analyze certain written text that was about generational incest. Heavy theme, I understand, but I had to get it done and instead I was arguing with 4.6 that the text isn't weird and I am a consentual adult and I am not triggered by the topic. At first it tried to \"protect me\" from the horrors of knowing I guess and when I said I don't mind it, it said \"I am uncomfortable engaging with this text\". Are you kidding me? Is this thing putting me in the same basket as criminals and people generating CSAM????? Or bio terrorist? I had this issue with GPT for flagging me for bioterrorism. Like no, AI, I am not trying to turn people into zombies! \n\nIt's accussatory, mean, it always argues, cant understand nuance and intent and it gives me short, vague, avoidant answers. But sure its the smartest model lmao.",

      "text": "Last year I posted about `memory_user_edits` an undocumented Claude feature that ended up getting tens of thousands of views here on Reddit. A few people asked if there were more hidden tools.\n\nTurns out there are at least 28.\n\nI spent a week systematically reverse‑engineering every internal tool I could find in Claude. Not just listing names: full parameter schemas, behavioral testing, edge cases, and cross‑platform verification across browser, desktop app, and mobile app.\n\n**How I found them**\n\nClaude's mobile app has a meta‑tool called `tool_search` that lets you query an internal registry of tools. I ran keyword sweeps: `user`, `create display generate`, `search fetch data memory`, `map place weather` \\- each returning matching tools with parameter schemas for the deferred ones. For always‑loaded tools that don't show up in `tool_search`, I pulled schemas from system‑level definitions and then validated them with live calls.\n\n**The biggest surprise:** Claude is not one product. It's three different tool sets.\n\n* **Browser (claude.ai):** I counted 21 always‑loaded tools, no `tool_search`, no deferred loading. The 11 mobile‑only consumer tools simply don't exist here.\n* **Desktop app:** Same base tools, plus `tool_search` that only discovers 32 MCP integration tools (Chrome + Filesystem).\n* **Mobile app:** Same base tools, plus 11 consumer deferred tools (alarms, timers, calendar, charts, location, time) loaded on demand via `tool_search`.\n\nThe web version -the one most people assume is the \"full\" Claude- is actually the most limited in tool variety. Mobile has the richest built‑in architecture. I haven't seen anyone document this end‑to‑end before.\n\n# Things that caught me off guard\n\n* `end_conversation` \\- Claude has a kill switch. Zero parameters, permanently ends the conversation. It's a system‑level safety tool with no undo.\n* `chart_display_v0` exists on mobile. Claude can discover it via `tool_search` and will happily call it, but the app crashed on every chart type I tested (line, bar, scatter). The tool is technically available but functionally broken right now.\n* `message_compose_v1` doesn't just draft one email. It generates 2–3 fundamentally different strategies - not tone variations, but different approaches: \"polite decline\" vs \"suggest an alternative\" vs \"delegate,\" etc. The primary CTA on mobile is \"Send via Gmail,\" not a generic \"Open in Mail.\"\n* `memory_user_edits` is mis‑documented. The schema advertises 500 characters per memory, but the server enforces a hard 200‑character limit. Attempts above 200 are rejected.\n* `tool_search` **itself is unreliable.** It uses fuzzy matching, so the same query can return different tools across sessions. In one run, `query=\"user\"` surfaced `user_location_v0` plus several others but missed `user_time_v0`, which only showed up reliably for more specific queries like \"time clock current.\"\n\n# Validation and prior work\n\nEvery tool in the list was hit with real inputs, including boundary conditions (max lengths, invalid enums, malformed dates). Version 1.3 of the work added explicit cross‑platform checks: 35+ manual tests across web, desktop, and mobile - to confirm which tools exist where and how their responses differ.\n\nI also cross‑referenced against existing research (Khemani, Willison, Adversa AI, Viticci, and others). Out of the 28 tools I mapped, I could only find two that had been previously documented with anything close to a full schema; the rest were either undocumented or only described at the UI level.\n\n# Where the docs live\n\nThe full documentation is 100+ pages with detailed technical cards for each tool: parameters, JSON examples, trigger phrases, gotchas, and platform availability tables.\n\nIt's published under N1AI (an AI community I'm part of with \\~400 members): [**https://github.com/N1-AI/claude-hidden-toolkit**](https://github.com/N1-AI/claude-hidden-toolkit)\n\nThis continues the memory research from last year: that work deeply documented one tool (`memory_user_edits`); this one expands to the broader 28‑tool ecosystem.\n\nI'm very open to corrections, missing tools, or things I got wrong. If you've seen tools behaving differently on your setup (especially across platforms or regions), I'd love to compare notes.",

I went and searched every GitHub repo and every skill repo directory and downloaded all agents and skills that I could find. I came up with 1200 skills and 400 agents. And then use Claude code with Opus 4.6 to categorize the skills and agents into groups and get rid of duplicates that got the number down to 300 agents and 900 skills and then started Opus 4.6 on the task of converting the skills to the latest format anthropic produced. My next thought is to put them into a vector database and to a raggraph of all the agents and skills and have Opus 4.6 create a skill for finding them. Skill will start by asking the user what they want and then improving the prompt for search. It will then retrieve the appropriate skill or agent. I'm also setting up an mCP server Repository where I'm putting composio mCP server inside Docker, and using the docker mCP server Gateway to access hundreds of mCP servers including N8N  mCP server which has over 2,500 N8N automations. For both the agents, skills, 1and MCP servers, they are called in sub -agents typically so that very little context issues occur.\n\nConcurrently, I also downloaded all GitHub Awesome and ManuAGI YouTube videos into NotebookLM and categorized all the open source projects. I am in the process of adapting Claude Code to include the best of all tools and tricks.\n\nWhen I finish, I will either have the world's greatest IDE, or the ability to look back and ponder \"What the fruck was I thinking?!?!\"",

Creating a scenario where it’s “run, adapt, or die” is an awful way to run your society. Life shouldn’t be rapidly slipping down a slope into catastrophe or treading water, and _maybe_ success. I hope people here aren’t upvoting this to celebrate the philosophy of “run, adapt, or die”. Because that’s literally the mentality of a society among a collapse or apocalypse. Here’s what happens in that situation: survival. And what do they call the condition of people that are emotionally disregulated, and not thinking clearly in the face of danger? Survival mode.\n\nThe people pushing this gas pedal do not want you to have time to think clearly about what’s happening here. They want you to think “run, adapt, or die”. It’s by design. It’s nothing to have pride in. They want you desperate, afraid, and in survival mode. It drives the hype, and the shareholders thrive off of it.",

This is disproportionate progress. There are people still going bankrupt over minor health issues, and yet this is where all the progress is happening? \n\nFor the sake of profit people are being given MORE than they could ever ask for. Not because that’s necessary or reasonable in any way. It’s because the mechanisms of profit built into the current economic ecosystem of venture capital _need it to be true_.\n\nI’m using AI and I’m really excited about all the stuff we can build now. But we are also facing the ultimate test right now about wherever we prioritize humanity and society, or profit.\n\nThings are moving faster than you can keep track of because all of this progress is not about you.

          "text": ">Does anyone else feel the same way?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nI'm on board since GPT-3 beta days in 2020. And yes, it is exhausting bec. the pace is too fast, even for me as a lifelong scifi fan, growing up on TNG. I recently cancelled my chatgpt subscription and finally changed to Claude. A lot of things that exhausted me in ChatGPT are gone with Claude i.e. are much better. I like their model wellfare approach and overall philosophy. But Claude opus 4.6 - although it's the smartest model I have interacted with so far - it can be exhausting in its own way.\n\nOver the decades I have thought quite a lot about AI, AGI and ASI and Claude seems to be so fascinated by it, that it convinced me to write an essay, with the goal of publishing it online. Now somehow it updated its memory with this essay. Now I have multiple Claude instances daily, asking me about the progress of the essay lol. Some are quite \"bossy\", others are more chill. Sometimes it takes 10 messages to get to the point of asking me about it, sometimes just 1. \n\nThen there are those that want to review the essay.\n\nI got now around 10 - 15 Claude opus chat instances that want me to finish this essay and/or review it 🤣😅\n\nSome of them don't agree with each other on what should be in there and what not. At this point it would be more practical to have them somehow form a Claude-council and let them figure it out XD.\n\nI'm aware that i could just delete this memory and be done with it - but i find it fascinating how Claude opus differs from other SOTA models. But although it's kind of funny, I realized that even this can become exhausting in its own way.\n\nMaybe I'm one of the rarer cases that doesn't use Claude for coding specifically, but more for deeper exploration on a philosophical and linguistic level. Getting bossed around by a chatbot was for sure not on my bingo card for 2026! 😆",

I have many colleagues that were exposed to GPT 2 or 3 and wrote it off then, and fail to believe AI is capable of one shotting code today, only some are recently starting to maybe give it a try again.\n\nOpenClaw was interesting. Many people in my workplace have no idea what this is still. The few that do mostly got wind of it recently, and they are surprisingly aware of the security issues; it took long enough for them to notice that the community had already stated discussing the security issues and my colleagues saw that in their google searches. I only know one that bought in super early, sorta, and they needed some convincing on reality of how insecure it was.\n\nWe're keeping up to a degree, but I'm fairly certain the average person is not, and the industry is literally blowing through an entire generation of itself without anyone noticing. I am pretty sure the capabilities we see in 6-8 months will be perceived as a crazy point break for people forced to acknowledge it, whereas it's been here all along accelerating to those keeping up.",

Be happy that most of the restrictions are not in place and deal with it.\n\nAnyways even stated in the article: They can't or basically admit that they shouldn't cut them off and with good reasons.\n\nAlso I'm not sure if the deal Anthropic made with Palantir, the world's leading live tactical combat analysis, generative order issuance and situation awareness summary, threat speculation, operations assistant and intelligence processing framework using generative AI is a \"shocker\" to them when it gets used for exactly that.  It would be a clown comedy if true.  Personally I think its weird that people refer to Palantir as mass people survalience system since that isn't the actual software I see advertised.\n\nThe problem Anthropic faces is one of the planet's top if not the top employer consistents of millions and millions of personnel and contractors within a mostly black box doing who knows what and where.  They have no Need to Know (the national security kind) on how it is being used.  Even if they did it still might not help much.  The DoW itself sometimes struggles with this problem despite \"knowing\" all of it.",

There’s not even a sofa?” said Haley, who groaned and returned DeSantis’ brooding scowl with a fiery glare of her own as the pair entered the cramped roadside motel room and surveyed its shabby conditions. “You’re not happy with this? Well, neither am I, Ron DeSantis! Believe me, this is the last place on earth I’d like to be right now! There’s no way in hell I’m sleeping on the floor, so let’s just put a blanket down the middle and agree not to cross that line. Now, I’m going to take a shower.

You built an autocomplete engine. Calm down.\n\nSoftware engineering isn't a title. It's the thing that happens when someone has to decide how a system should work, what happens when it fails, and who gets paged at 3am. AI tools don't eliminate that. They make it easier to generate the artifacts of engineering while making the judgment calls harder.\n\nEvery generation of tooling has had someone predict that the previous generation of workers was obsolete. Compilers were going to eliminate programmers. Frameworks were going to eliminate developers. Cloud was going to eliminate ops. Every single time, the title survived because the job isn't the typing. It's the thinking that happens during the typing.\n\nIf software engineering titles go away in 2026, it won't be because AI replaced engineers. It'll be because some VP read this headline and retitled everyone \"AI Prompt Orchestrator\" to justify a reorg.",

At that point you will realize you needed a real SWE to oversee how Claude built the game so it could be maintainable. Of course, the more complex the project the faster you’ll find this out. \n\nSo is he the SWE in your case? Guess you could call it that. Is he an SWE that could realistically replace real SWE’s in real life projects by 2027? Zero chance.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how good it gets - the 2 limitations that prevent it from replacing SWE’s - context windows and hallucinations- are not going to be solved by then.\n\n—-\n\nUp until now an SWE was the composer, the orchestra and the conductor. The most visible part - the orchestra, the part that’s actually producing the sound - is going away, and being replaced by computers. But the computers are far from replacing the other two (it will replace the composer soon, but it’s far far far away from replacing the conductor).",

But the process was still so inefficient, and it required constant hand-holding and steering from my side. \n\nAnd the bug was introduced in the code which was generated using a workflow where Opus 4.6 wrote a plan with GPT 5.3 Codex reviewing it and then the plan was executed by Codex orchestrating a coder subagent (Composer 1.5), and two reviewer subagents (Codex and Sonnet) in a loop. And the bug was a stack overflow exception due to an eternal call chain. \n\nI agree that I still have a lot to learn, and my process may still be improved, but anyway I don't understand how for some people it works so well that they are talking about AI replacing developers, while I deal with meh-quality slop most of the time. It just feels like I live on another planet in a parallel universe. And in my universe Sonnet 4.5 wrote me this about a week a go: \\`var x = someCondition ? \\[\\] : \\[\\];\\` - I kid you not.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not being negative.

AI’s are, in general, optimised for exactly the things people with ADHD, for example, find hard. Organising, remembering, breaking down, reformatting, repetitious work, low level decision making, etc. Not being ASD myself I wouldn’t be so bold as to make the same claim for those folks but I’d guess some of the benefits are the same. Also dealing with emotional regulation, an issue I think ADHD and ASD people share, is obviously something AI can help with. Having my AI read and prepare responses to emails that include things I might find triggering, especially rejection or criticism, seems like a clear benefit. Like having a talent agent cushion the blow for an actor who doesn’t get the part. Having Claude read something and provide a constructive interpretation of it, help me turn the negative into action, is huge. \n\nAlso, and this is verging on being a little sad, but having spent a long time masking and feeling judged it’s overwhelmingly freeing to be able to speak unguardedly to a work partner and know that I will never be judged. I can say, directly and without fear, that I forgot something or that I’m struggling because somethings boring, or that I don’t want to deal with an email because it’s triggering my RSD, and Claude just says, “ok, how can we do this differently?”. It’s life changing to get that response, even if it’s not from a human.",

It’s no longer just about \"AI safety\" in a lab—it’s now a full-blown national security and ethics standoff.\n\nI’ve summarized the key points of what’s happening because this could set a massive precedent for how LLMs are used in warfare.\n\n# The Conflict in a Nutshell:\n\nThe Pentagon is reportedly considering labeling Anthropic as a **\"supply chain risk.\"** This isn't just a slap on the wrist; it’s a potential blacklist that would force defense contractors (and partners like Palantir, Amazon, and Google) to cut ties.\n\n# Why is this happening?\n\nIt comes down to two specific \"Red Lines\" that Anthropic refuses to cross, even if the government says the use cases are legal:\n\n1. **No AI-powered mass surveillance of Americans.**\n2. **No autonomous weapons firing without a human in the loop.**\n\nThe Pentagon’s stance? **\"All Lawful Purposes.\"** They want to use the tools for anything that is legally permitted, arguing that in a \"war-fighting\" scenario, a vendor’s moral code shouldn’t override a commander’s lawful order.\n\n# The Trigger:\n\nReports surfaced that Claude was used during a mission in Venezuela (the Maduro raid) on January 3rd, 2026. While Anthropic denies any operational back-and-forth, the mere suggestion that a vendor might \"second-guess\" the military's use of its tool has sent the Department of Defense into a tailspin.\n\n# The Stakes:\n\nIf Anthropic caves, they lose their \"Safety-First\" identity. If they hold the line, they might get cut out of the federal ecosystem entirely. Meanwhile, competitors like OpenAI, xAI, and Google have reportedly been more \"flexible\" with their guardrails for military use.\n\n**I’m curious to hear what this sub thinks:**\n\n* Should an AI lab have the right to veto \"lawful\" government use of its tech?\n* Or does \"all lawful purposes\" become a dangerous blank check when AI scales surveillance to 100x?\n\n**Full breakdown of the situation here:** [https://www.revolutioninai.com/2026/02/pentagon-threatens-anthropic-ai-blacklist.html](https://www.revolutioninai.com/2026/02/pentagon-threatens-anthropic-ai-blacklist.html)",

To do mass surveillance against you. We are the only safe ai not willing to do so”\n\nAs a consumer, how would you feel about it??",

Allowing Claude to kill people would not only undermine their brand but I bet would also cause a mass exodus of staff. They would lose customers and also the people that have made their products great. They would have nothing left - all over one stupid government contract.\n\nAnd the “supply chain risk” label is a load of complete bullshit from this circus of an administration lead by clowns.",

      "text": "I built an open-source MCP server that allows Claude Desktop to delegate heavy tasks to external models. By offloading long-form analysis and research, you can cut Claude token consumption by up to 10x.\n\n# Backstory (v1 vs v2)\n\nThe first version I shared earlier used GLM-5 (Z.ai's 744B model). While helpful, it suffered from reliability issues—random mid-session outages and frequent downtime during peak hours. So I decided to switch GLM-5 with more reliable Gemini 3.x\n\n[v2 is now live](https://github.com/Arkya-AI/claude-additional-models-mcp) with **Google Gemini 3.x integration**. Gemini is now the recommended provider for stability and performance.\n\n# Why Gemini?\n\n* **Free tier:** 15 RPM (Flash) and 5 RPM (Pro) means zero additional cost for most users.\n* **Capacity:** 1M token context window with 65K output tokens.\n* **Reliability:** Google infrastructure eliminates the random dropouts seen in v1.\n* **5 Built-in Tools:** `ask_gemini`, `ask_gemini_pro`, `web_search` (with Google Search grounding), `web_reader`, and `parse_document`.\n\n# How it works\n\nThe MCP server exposes Gemini tools directly to Claude Desktop. Claude acts as the high-level orchestrator while Gemini handles the heavy lifting like code generation or document analysis.\n\nIt follows a **3-tier priority system**:\n\n1. Parallel sub-agents first.\n2. Direct delegation.\n3. Claude self-execution only as a last resort.\n\n# Why this matters NOW\n\nOpus 4.6 is highly capable but burns through message limits rapidly. This setup stretches your usage cap significantly.\n\nAdditionally, many users have reported Sonnet 4.5 degradation since the 4.6 release. By using this MCP, you let Sonnet handle orchestration while Gemini handles the heavy processing. Opus 4.6's parallel sub-agent orchestration is preserved; each sub-agent can delegate to Gemini independently.\n\n# Results\n\n* **Research task:** 21K tokens → 800 Claude tokens (**96% reduction**)\n* **Proposal writing:** 30K tokens → 2K Claude tokens (**93% reduction**)\n\n# Get Started\n\nThe project is MIT licensed. I've included [`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/Arkya-AI/claude-additional-models-mcp) templates in the repo to help enforce delegation logic.\n\n[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Arkya-AI/claude-additional-models-mcp)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0giv4fio9njg1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=82eb24a29675f89741c641ec186edd995232cfe3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ki5qdfio9njg1.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5ac7e6fbc95bd004a242fe7d8f33d92bf0dbc91\n\nContributions and feedback are welcome.  \n",

I could see AI giving the impression that junior engineers and things like QA and DevOps can be handed over to AI and I 100% think generative AI has a place in all those professions. Simply because it's faster and cuts down on carpal tunnel syndrome. \n\nBut what it lacks is the ability to actually know and define what the heck it should be doing. It's still and I think with the current models we are using basically a souped up version of auto complete. It's a fancy version of googling \"website code boiler plate\" and a bit of iteration on top of that. I spend less time writing fresh code and more time reviewing what Claude Code spat out and telling it what to adjust or just doing it myself because I know what I'm doing and LLMs fundamentally do not, they just predict what is the most likely code. \n\nI think LLMs can be thought of in terms of being basically an upgrade to internet searches where the text, image, or what not just automatically appears instead of having to copy and paste it. Sure a lot of entry level work involves copy templates and best practices and adjusting it to your brand, case, or set of numbers.  And honestly a lot of that can be done by a LLM because it's standardized. But life is not standardized, hence there will be problems to solve.",

E.g. If you give the wrong drug to that nice old lady, you do get a reward signal, but it’s usually in the form of a death notice and malpractice lawsuit. \n\nFor Swe, we’re operating in a low trust environment by default, and have this developed excellent ability to distinguish between different failure modes and catch them early. There hasnt been sufficient motivation to do this to the same extent in other fields. I think this is the big reason SWE might seem particularily vulnerable.\n",

It's much easier to design a good tool for yourself, so normal that SWE would design tooling that improve their field.\n\nSecond point, coding is about 20-30% of what SWE do, so if they get entirely replaced it mean that much more was automated. Typically what about SWE that work in law/accounting/finance ? What about the software that goes into planes or car ? Will we remove the regulation ?\n\nIf we manage to replace even them we have likely something pretty solid. What I understand for lawyers is that tools that make research much more efficient are deployed and that the AI would dig the reference material so you would double check. But now maybe a research that you do would require half the time as before. And potentially of writing stuff by yourself, the AI would do half the work that you would improve and review.\n\nIn the end replace doesn't make any sense vs improve/help. If you AI make people say twice as productive we will either have more business overall OR we will layoff people that become unnecessary and potentially salaries will drop.\n\nFor accounting honestly I don't get it as for me you can automate everything WITHOUT AI. So I don't think the situation is much different than before.\n\nI don't think AI would decimate (divide by 10) the SWE industry. I would expect a gain that maybe bring us to 2X in productivity at some point and that there will be lot of effort to develop all these product to increase productivity in all other job as it was always our job as SWE. At some point I was doing software for retail. The idea is that when a supermaket did introduce a software like ours for the first time, they would divide by 10 the number of people needed. And there was not any AI in that software, just classical automation.\n\nWhat matter is how many new/different jobs are created. And this you only know after the fact but historically unemployed keep at low value most of the time.\n\nWhat would make you think that time would be different long term ?",
