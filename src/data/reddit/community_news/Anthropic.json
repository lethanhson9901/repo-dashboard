I also use it in my general notes. It can leave a summary of whatever conversation you're having.

But the performance of opus 4.5 has been nothing but unacceptably poor. I was wondering if anyone else is in the same boat. I'm not sure if it is associated with the release of 2.1.1. if it is part of AB testing then I need a way to opt out of any such testing. ",

Do they still hallucinate here and there - yep - but the local loop won't do redundant work. If they find issues - the local loop reads from the PRs (github has an extension for VSCode you can use). If you're worried about tracing - both Claude and Codex do this (Codex is EXTREMELY good at it).\n\nAt this point - deployment to Azure...

The consumer prays its the former but more likely its the latter since the people who use AI for programming tend to be extremely lazy.\n\nAlso, principal engineers are rarely tech leads at the same time and usually stopped programming when they became a staff engineer.

Writing a generic description like handles git commits means Claude might never load it because dozens of things could match.\n\nWhat worked for me: make the description specific enough that it only matches when you actually want it. Something like generates conventional commit messages from staged diffs is way more reliable than a vague one-liner.\n\nFor structuring... I keep SKILL.md under 500 words and bundle anything heavy into references/. Claude loads those only when needed so you dont blow context on every invocation.

      "text": "I’ve been daily driving the Claude Code CLI for a bit now. It’s easily the fastest terminal agent I’ve used for refactors, but the one thing driving me crazy was the total lack of visibility. When an agent takes 40 seconds to finish a turn or starts looping on a shell command, I want to know exactly where the bottleneck is—not just wait for the final output.\n\nI spent the weekend digging into how to actually trace these sessions. Unlike other tools, Claude Code is a bit of a \"post-hoc\" system. It doesn't give you real-time event streams out of the box, but it writes every single detail—thinking blocks, tool calls, and exact token usage—into JSONL transcript files on your disk at `~/.claude/projects/{project}/sessions/{session}.jsonl`.\n\nTo get this into a readable trace, you have to use the `Stop` hook in your `~/.claude/settings.json`. The trick is that this hook fires right after the turn ends, allowing you to run a script that parses the latest transcript and reconstructs the entire hierarchical span.\n\nThe cool part about Claude Code's model is that it exposes token data that Cursor doesn't. You can see the exact breakdown of prompt tokens vs. cache creation vs. completion tokens. It’s the only way I’ve found to actually track what a session is costing in real-time.\n\nMy config looks like this now:\n\nJSON\n\n    {\n      \"hooks\": {\n        \"Stop\": [\n          {\n            \"hooks\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"command\",\n                \"command\": \"python ~/.claude/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nNow, instead of just a terminal output, I get a full trace tree that looks like this:\n\n* **claude\\_session\\_xyz** (32.4s)\n   * ├── **Thinking** (1.2s) - \"Analyzing the dependency graph...\"\n   * ├── **Tool: list\\_files** (0.4s)\n   * ├── **Thinking** (0.8s) - \"I need to check the test suite.\"\n   * └── **Shell: npm test** (5.1s)\n\nIt makes debugging agent failures a lot less like guesswork. If anyone wants the specific Python logic for parsing the JSONL transcripts and pushing them to an API, see my full docs in comments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hs5astt64edg1.png?width=2287&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fb8d16ad2cd5bf79033cc0890f52ad0e7413cb0\n\n",

Claude plans the steps, works across local files you explicitly share, and executes multi-step tasks with minimal back & forth. Context stays alive until the task finishes as you review plans and approve risky actions.\n\nWhat stood out to me:\n\n* Local execution on macOS inside an isolated VM\n* Explicit folder-level permissions\n* Designed for long-running multi-step work.\n* Still a research preview with sharp limits. (MacOS only, higher usage, no persistence)\n\nI went into how the architecture actually works, including planning, sub-agent coordination, file access, and safety boundaries.

They’re able to do much more complex internal accounting for the quota than directly translating a $20 subscription to $20 of API credits or similar. **You’re not paying for tokens, you’re paying for a fractional time slice of their infrastructure**. \n\nAnthropic rents fixed servers, so they’re sunk costs.  During periods of lower usage, the GPUs would be wasted doing jothing, so usage is “cheap” to use, while periods of congestion mean they’re potentially maxing out their GPUs and renting extra or picking which customer to prioritize, so it’s “expensive”. \n\nFurthermore, tokens aren’t created equal. The API pricing hides this, but each token gets more expensive to calculate than the previous one, because it uses more GPU. A single request with 100k tokens will use more GPU resources than 100 requests of 1k. That means it’s more expensive for Anthropic to serve a customer with one long conversation instead of a customer with many tiny conversations. \n\n(And that’s totally ignoring costs/optimizations of prompt caching too, which things like Claude Code aggressively use)",

Actually,\n\n* Make a new folder, maybe called \"Claude Workspace\"\n* Copy files into it (do not move them)\n* Think about it as a playground where mistakes are okay\n\nPeople usually forget to make backups. But if asked to intentionally copy files to a new folder, easy-peacy! People will do it\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/cant-wait-to-try-claude-cowork-dont-let-it-accidentally-v0-6yfzbxzktsdg1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a3ad89ed5799352120a3c2a6f95db688de70c8c)\n\n[Try to create a seperate folder where mistakes are okay](https://preview.redd.it/u05upqz5usdg1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89255cc12823dc6f50ec949fea7571c802808a2)\n\n# Method 2: Be Very Specific\n\n**Being polite with AI can be dangerous.**\n\n❌ Bad: \"Could you organize these files?\"\n\n✅ Good: \"Sort these 47 PDFs by date. DO NOT delete anything. Make folders named by year.\"\n\nWhen you are more specific, Claude Cowork does not need to guess, and **guessing is where problems happen.**\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/cant-wait-to-try-claude-cowork-dont-let-it-accidentally-v0-la0k8nontsdg1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=6470035b81b1aacb29c230acfc8b3fc575a0b8d5)\n\n[Being specific on your prompt is helpful](https://preview.redd.it/ucrxa618usdg1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=364ec963593bc1e5fb6378fbd3532c3c5fe737b3)\n\n# Method 3: Check Before You Approve\n\nWhen Claude Cowork wants to delete/move/rename something:\n\n* Wait 2 seconds\n* Ask: \"Do I understand WHY Claude wants to do this?\"\n* No? Refuse and do it yourself\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/cant-wait-to-try-claude-cowork-dont-let-it-accidentally-v0-pqwscvyptsdg1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=57beebbd3b7dbf28d7ecfce65ace0ba95ef7a5a6)\n\nBe cautious on what Claude Cowork is about to do before you choose\n\n[Be cautious on what Claude Cowork is about to do before you choose](https://preview.redd.it/zo3w5hw9usdg1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=565137508b119fe349c5817b8ef02e78a3e87013)\n\n# A Simple Smart-Intern Mindset \n\nClaude Cowork is fast & useful for people. But like driving a fast car, you want to drive it carefully. \n\nGood news is all these protections are basically just asking you to think a bit differently:\n\n**Think of Claude Cowork as a smart intern who understands words literally, and has the key to your office.**\n\n**You would not tell an intern \"figure out my files by yourself.\" Same thing here.**",

I was excited when Anthropic announced the capability to\ngenerate files like .pptx and have spent soooo much time trying to get Claude to create a PPT\nfrom scratch. After several attempts, I’ve gotten stuck.\n\nThe content itself is fine, but the slide structure is off. Plus small changes require regenerating\nbig chunks. The resulting file requires so much manual cleanup that it’d probably be faster to do\nthe whole thing manually. I’m not saying the feature is useless, I just haven’t been able to figure out how to make it work properly.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?",

Just because Claude can generate a .pptx file doesn't mean it knows how to make a well-designed slide deck. After trying and failing like you did, I finally gave up and had to change my approach. I now use Claude for refining content then hand that off to Gamma for generating the presentation itself. Then export that as a .pptx file to share with clients.",

You have to break up the work a certain way as it often runs out of context window and just stops.  So I first run research, then another prompt to build storyline in markdown, and then output into JSX and then output slides.  All separate steps.  Then I convert JSX to PPTX about 2 to 3 slides at a time.  It will try different things and fail at them and then retry. You have to keep track of what things failed and what things succeeded and then put in conversion guidelines into a markdown file and save that as part of the knowledge for the next time you run the prompt.",
