Happy to answer any questions/ would love to hear feedback. Sorry if it reads markety, it's copied from the Linkedin post I made where you don't get much post attention if you don't write this way:\n\nStrawberry launches today it's Free. Open source. Guaranteed by information theory.  \n  \nThe insight: When Claude confidently misreads your stack trace and proposes the wrong root cause it's not broken. It's doing exactly what it was trained to do: compress the internet into weights, decompress on demand. When there isn't enough information to reconstruct the right answer, it fills gaps with statistically plausible but wrong content.  \n  \nThe breakthrough: We proved hallucinations occur when information budgets fall below mathematical thresholds. We can calculate exactly how many bits of evidence are needed to justify any claim, before generation happens.  \nNow it's a Claude Code MCP. One tool call: detect\\_hallucination  \n  \nWhy this is a game-changer?  \n  \nInstead of debugging Claude's mistakes for 3 hours, you catch them in 30 seconds. Instead of \"looks right to me,\" you get mathematical confidence scores. Instead of shipping vibes, you ship verified reasoning. Claude doesn't just flag its own BS, it self-corrects, runs experiments, gathers more real evidence, and only proceeds with what survives. Vibe coding with guardrails.  \n  \nReal example:  \n  \nClaude root-caused why a detector I built had low accuracy. Claude made 6 confident claims that could have led me down the wrong path for hours. I said: \"Run detect\\_hallucination on your root cause reasoning, and enrich your analysis if any claims don't verify.\"  \n  \nResults:  \nClaim 1: ✅ Verified (99.7% confidence)  \nClaim 4: ❌ Flagged (0.3%) — \"My interpretation, not proven\"  \nClaim 5: ❌ Flagged (20%) — \"Correlation ≠ causation\"  \nClaim 6: ❌ Flagged (0.8%) — \"Prescriptive, not factual\"  \nClaude's response: \"I cannot state interpretive conclusions as those did not pass verification.\"  \n  \nRe-analyzed. Ran causal experiments. Only stated verified facts.

This means log-loss under a trained model provides an upper bound on Kolmogorov complexity up to a constant that depends on the \"reference machine.\"\n\nFor LLMs, the reference machine is the architecture + trained weights θ. The autoregressive factorization p(x) = Π p(x\\_i | x\\_{<i}) defines a valid prefix-free coding scheme where each conditional assigns bits, total bits = -log p(x). Different architectures = different reference machines, but relationships between them are bounded by O(1) per the invariance theorem.\n\nThe assumptions:\n\n1. Model class is expressive enough to approximate the true distribution (universal approximation)\n2. Training achieves near MDL-optimal compression (empirically validated: mixture-optimality gap <10⁻⁴ nats/token)\n3. Positional encodings make the model minimize E\\_π\\[K(X|π)\\] rather than permutation-invariant K(X)\n\nPoint 3 is the paper's main contribution. Classical K(X) is permutation-invariant, but transformers necessarily condition on ordering via positional encodings. The resolution is the expectation over orderings recovers the complexity interpretation, with the Jensen gap from permutation averaging bounded at Θ(log n/n). So any specific ordering violates exchangeability, but the expectation-level behavior admits the Kolmogorov interpretation up to additive constants that wash out at scale.\n\nThe \"LLM as reference machine\" framing is consistent with Delétang et al.'s \"language modeling is compression\" result.",

But the performance of opus 4.5 has been nothing but unacceptably poor. I was wondering if anyone else is in the same boat. I'm not sure if it is associated with the release of 2.1.1. if it is part of AB testing then I need a way to opt out of any such testing. ",

The limits are controlled by Anthropic on their side, its not client side. They get all the data they want. The API calls go directly to them. The value prop for the plan is you can use X tokens within X sessions and when you use all that you are done until the clock resets. That's the trade. Just like the gym.  I can wear whatever color shirt I want and drive any car I want to the gym. The gym is the Anthropic endpoint for the model. \n\nUnless Anthropic are doing something inside CC to manipulate model routing and token consumption, that they aren't disclosing, then there is absolutely no difference if you make an API call from CC or Crush, or Vscode or whatever.  The limits are the limits. If CC has smarter token strategies than Open Code that doesn't impact the total tokens that Anthropic have made available to the user. \n\nThere has to be something else going on. If they really are forcing CC usage, then it is doing something behind the scenes like routing to other models without disclosure. Because as far as I can figure, that's the only way they could be saving money. That could explain some things, but I sure hope it's not true. yikes if it is.",

      "text": "I’ve been daily driving the Claude Code CLI for a bit now. It’s easily the fastest terminal agent I’ve used for refactors, but the one thing driving me crazy was the total lack of visibility. When an agent takes 40 seconds to finish a turn or starts looping on a shell command, I want to know exactly where the bottleneck is—not just wait for the final output.\n\nI spent the weekend digging into how to actually trace these sessions. Unlike other tools, Claude Code is a bit of a \"post-hoc\" system. It doesn't give you real-time event streams out of the box, but it writes every single detail—thinking blocks, tool calls, and exact token usage—into JSONL transcript files on your disk at `~/.claude/projects/{project}/sessions/{session}.jsonl`.\n\nTo get this into a readable trace, you have to use the `Stop` hook in your `~/.claude/settings.json`. The trick is that this hook fires right after the turn ends, allowing you to run a script that parses the latest transcript and reconstructs the entire hierarchical span.\n\nThe cool part about Claude Code's model is that it exposes token data that Cursor doesn't. You can see the exact breakdown of prompt tokens vs. cache creation vs. completion tokens. It’s the only way I’ve found to actually track what a session is costing in real-time.\n\nMy config looks like this now:\n\nJSON\n\n    {\n      \"hooks\": {\n        \"Stop\": [\n          {\n            \"hooks\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"command\",\n                \"command\": \"python ~/.claude/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nNow, instead of just a terminal output, I get a full trace tree that looks like this:\n\n* **claude\\_session\\_xyz** (32.4s)\n   * ├── **Thinking** (1.2s) - \"Analyzing the dependency graph...\"\n   * ├── **Tool: list\\_files** (0.4s)\n   * ├── **Thinking** (0.8s) - \"I need to check the test suite.\"\n   * └── **Shell: npm test** (5.1s)\n\nIt makes debugging agent failures a lot less like guesswork. If anyone wants the specific Python logic for parsing the JSONL transcripts and pushing them to an API, see my full docs in comments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hs5astt64edg1.png?width=2287&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fb8d16ad2cd5bf79033cc0890f52ad0e7413cb0\n\n",

Giving models file access, connecting Drive, stitching tools together, and calling that “agents.”\n\nClaude has now shipped this as a first-class product feature.\n\nClaude Cowork is a task execution mode in the Claude Desktop app. Instead of responding to prompts, it works toward an outcome.\n\nYou describe an outcome. Claude plans the steps, works across local files you explicitly share, and executes multi-step tasks with minimal back & forth. Context stays alive until the task finishes as you review plans and approve risky actions.\n\nWhat stood out to me:\n\n* Local execution on macOS inside an isolated VM\n* Explicit folder-level permissions\n* Designed for long-running multi-step work.\n* Still a research preview with sharp limits. (MacOS only, higher usage, no persistence)\n\nI went into how the architecture actually works, including planning, sub-agent coordination, file access, and safety boundaries.
