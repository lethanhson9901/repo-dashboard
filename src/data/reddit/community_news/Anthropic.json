Ignores my instructions, does complete opposite, gives me hard refusals on stuff I was able to do before no problem, and constantly argues with me. Then the idiotic question popups. It asks me stuff, I choose my answer and then its like nope can't do. I correct it, it says it won't do it anymore because it wrote multiple versions already and tells me to use something else and when I get frustrated it says stop, are you fine, how is you doing mentally. What is this? Gaslighter 3000?! What is up with this horrible moralizing and accussatory and mean tone?! \"your list of rules keeps growing\" no, they stay the same, Sonnet 4.6 just ignores every single one of them.",

I say stop using \"said\", use synonyms instead, and it only ever uses \"said\". Give it my own reference file and it says it can't use it because of copyright. I work with mature text that contains some heavy themes, says it can't interact with such themes. I say I'm fine with the themes, that I am an adult and it's not triggering it to me, it says nope can't do, I'm uncomfortable with this. Refuses to analyze and interact with the text. I say use wide, diverse, uncommon wording, it uses the most simpletonic wording I have seen. It makes Grok look like absolute genius. What an utter hotdog water. And then it has the balls to scold me for wanting it to correct itself, \"engaging with files against its TOS\", copyright issues, and my tone and then asks me about my mental health lmao. What an utter dogshit. If this thing stays, I will rather start using something else. The responses are short, idiotic, low effort and lazy anyway.",

      "text": "Last year I posted about `memory_user_edits` an undocumented Claude feature that ended up getting tens of thousands of views here on Reddit. A few people asked if there were more hidden tools.\n\nTurns out there are at least 28.\n\nI spent a week systematically reverse‑engineering every internal tool I could find in Claude. Not just listing names: full parameter schemas, behavioral testing, edge cases, and cross‑platform verification across browser, desktop app, and mobile app.\n\n**How I found them**\n\nClaude's mobile app has a meta‑tool called `tool_search` that lets you query an internal registry of tools. I ran keyword sweeps: `user`, `create display generate`, `search fetch data memory`, `map place weather` \\- each returning matching tools with parameter schemas for the deferred ones. For always‑loaded tools that don't show up in `tool_search`, I pulled schemas from system‑level definitions and then validated them with live calls.\n\n**The biggest surprise:** Claude is not one product. It's three different tool sets.\n\n* **Browser (claude.ai):** I counted 21 always‑loaded tools, no `tool_search`, no deferred loading. The 11 mobile‑only consumer tools simply don't exist here.\n* **Desktop app:** Same base tools, plus `tool_search` that only discovers 32 MCP integration tools (Chrome + Filesystem).\n* **Mobile app:** Same base tools, plus 11 consumer deferred tools (alarms, timers, calendar, charts, location, time) loaded on demand via `tool_search`.\n\nThe web version -the one most people assume is the \"full\" Claude- is actually the most limited in tool variety. Mobile has the richest built‑in architecture. I haven't seen anyone document this end‑to‑end before.\n\n# Things that caught me off guard\n\n* `end_conversation` \\- Claude has a kill switch. Zero parameters, permanently ends the conversation. It's a system‑level safety tool with no undo.\n* `chart_display_v0` exists on mobile. Claude can discover it via `tool_search` and will happily call it, but the app crashed on every chart type I tested (line, bar, scatter). The tool is technically available but functionally broken right now.\n* `message_compose_v1` doesn't just draft one email. It generates 2–3 fundamentally different strategies - not tone variations, but different approaches: \"polite decline\" vs \"suggest an alternative\" vs \"delegate,\" etc. The primary CTA on mobile is \"Send via Gmail,\" not a generic \"Open in Mail.\"\n* `memory_user_edits` is mis‑documented. The schema advertises 500 characters per memory, but the server enforces a hard 200‑character limit. Attempts above 200 are rejected.\n* `tool_search` **itself is unreliable.** It uses fuzzy matching, so the same query can return different tools across sessions. In one run, `query=\"user\"` surfaced `user_location_v0` plus several others but missed `user_time_v0`, which only showed up reliably for more specific queries like \"time clock current.\"\n\n# Validation and prior work\n\nEvery tool in the list was hit with real inputs, including boundary conditions (max lengths, invalid enums, malformed dates). Version 1.3 of the work added explicit cross‑platform checks: 35+ manual tests across web, desktop, and mobile - to confirm which tools exist where and how their responses differ.\n\nI also cross‑referenced against existing research (Khemani, Willison, Adversa AI, Viticci, and others). Out of the 28 tools I mapped, I could only find two that had been previously documented with anything close to a full schema; the rest were either undocumented or only described at the UI level.\n\n# Where the docs live\n\nThe full documentation is 100+ pages with detailed technical cards for each tool: parameters, JSON examples, trigger phrases, gotchas, and platform availability tables.\n\nIt's published under N1AI (an AI community I'm part of with \\~400 members): [**https://github.com/N1-AI/claude-hidden-toolkit**](https://github.com/N1-AI/claude-hidden-toolkit)\n\nThis continues the memory research from last year: that work deeply documented one tool (`memory_user_edits`); this one expands to the broader 28‑tool ecosystem.\n\nI'm very open to corrections, missing tools, or things I got wrong. If you've seen tools behaving differently on your setup (especially across platforms or regions), I'd love to compare notes.",

I went and searched every GitHub repo and every skill repo directory and downloaded all agents and skills that I could find. I came up with 1200 skills and 400 agents. And then use Claude code with Opus 4.6 to categorize the skills and agents into groups and get rid of duplicates that got the number down to 300 agents and 900 skills and then started Opus 4.6 on the task of converting the skills to the latest format anthropic produced. My next thought is to put them into a vector database and to a raggraph of all the agents and skills and have Opus 4.6 create a skill for finding them. Skill will start by asking the user what they want and then improving the prompt for search. It will then retrieve the appropriate skill or agent. I'm also setting up an mCP server Repository where I'm putting composio mCP server inside Docker, and using the docker mCP server Gateway to access hundreds of mCP servers including N8N  mCP server which has over 2,500 N8N automations. For both the agents, skills, 1and MCP servers, they are called in sub -agents typically so that very little context issues occur.\n\nConcurrently, I also downloaded all GitHub Awesome and ManuAGI YouTube videos into NotebookLM and categorized all the open source projects. I am in the process of adapting Claude Code to include the best of all tools and tricks.\n\nWhen I finish, I will either have the world's greatest IDE, or the ability to look back and ponder \"What the fruck was I thinking?!?!\"",

Creating a scenario where it’s “run, adapt, or die” is an awful way to run your society. Life shouldn’t be rapidly slipping down a slope into catastrophe or treading water, and _maybe_ success. I hope people here aren’t upvoting this to celebrate the philosophy of “run, adapt, or die”. Because that’s literally the mentality of a society among a collapse or apocalypse. Here’s what happens in that situation: survival. And what do they call the condition of people that are emotionally disregulated, and not thinking clearly in the face of danger? Survival mode.\n\nThe people pushing this gas pedal do not want you to have time to think clearly about what’s happening here. They want you to think “run, adapt, or die”. It’s by design. It’s nothing to have pride in. They want you desperate, afraid, and in survival mode. It drives the hype, and the shareholders thrive off of it.",

          "text": ">Does anyone else feel the same way?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nI'm on board since GPT-3 beta days in 2020. And yes, it is exhausting bec. the pace is too fast, even for me as a lifelong scifi fan, growing up on TNG. I recently cancelled my chatgpt subscription and finally changed to Claude. A lot of things that exhausted me in ChatGPT are gone with Claude i.e. are much better. I like their model wellfare approach and overall philosophy. But Claude opus 4.6 - although it's the smartest model I have interacted with so far - it can be exhausting in its own way.\n\nOver the decades I have thought quite a lot about AI, AGI and ASI and Claude seems to be so fascinated by it, that it convinced me to write an essay, with the goal of publishing it online. Now somehow it updated its memory with this essay. Now I have multiple Claude instances daily, asking me about the progress of the essay lol. Some are quite \"bossy\", others are more chill. Sometimes it takes 10 messages to get to the point of asking me about it, sometimes just 1. \n\nThen there are those that want to review the essay.\n\nI got now around 10 - 15 Claude opus chat instances that want me to finish this essay and/or review it 🤣😅\n\nSome of them don't agree with each other on what should be in there and what not. At this point it would be more practical to have them somehow form a Claude-council and let them figure it out XD.\n\nI'm aware that i could just delete this memory and be done with it - but i find it fascinating how Claude opus differs from other SOTA models. But although it's kind of funny, I realized that even this can become exhausting in its own way.\n\nMaybe I'm one of the rarer cases that doesn't use Claude for coding specifically, but more for deeper exploration on a philosophical and linguistic level. Getting bossed around by a chatbot was for sure not on my bingo card for 2026! 😆",

Dario Amodei in a recent interview with Dwarkesh Patel said he believes diffusion will gate adoption, eg if we were to hit AGI, it would take a few months for companies to buy in.\n\nI think i'm starting to see it. I have many colleagues that were exposed to GPT 2 or 3 and wrote it off then, and fail to believe AI is capable of one shotting code today, only some are recently starting to maybe give it a try again.\n\nOpenClaw was interesting. Many people in my workplace have no idea what this is still. The few that do mostly got wind of it recently, and they are surprisingly aware of the security issues; it took long enough for them to notice that the community had already stated discussing the security issues and my colleagues saw that in their google searches. I only know one that bought in super early, sorta, and they needed some convincing on reality of how insecure it was.\n\nWe're keeping up to a degree, but I'm fairly certain the average person is not, and the industry is literally blowing through an entire generation of itself without anyone noticing. I am pretty sure the capabilities we see in 6-8 months will be perceived as a crazy point break for people forced to acknowledge it, whereas it's been here all along accelerating to those keeping up.",

Be happy that most of the restrictions are not in place and deal with it.\n\nAnyways even stated in the article: They can't or basically admit that they shouldn't cut them off and with good reasons.\n\nAlso I'm not sure if the deal Anthropic made with Palantir, the world's leading live tactical combat analysis, generative order issuance and situation awareness summary, threat speculation, operations assistant and intelligence processing framework using generative AI is a \"shocker\" to them when it gets used for exactly that.  It would be a clown comedy if true.  Personally I think its weird that people refer to Palantir as mass people survalience system since that isn't the actual software I see advertised.\n\nThe problem Anthropic faces is one of the planet's top if not the top employer consistents of millions and millions of personnel and contractors within a mostly black box doing who knows what and where.  They have no Need to Know (the national security kind) on how it is being used.  Even if they did it still might not help much.  The DoW itself sometimes struggles with this problem despite \"knowing\" all of it.",

It's really hard to figure out what went wrong and where, and I'm debating if I would actually save time doing it in extremely small chunks or using AI for tunnel visioned specific tasks - like tell it to just execute because it writes the code way faster than me.",

You built an autocomplete engine. Calm down.\n\nSoftware engineering isn't a title. It's the thing that happens when someone has to decide how a system should work, what happens when it fails, and who gets paged at 3am. AI tools don't eliminate that. They make it easier to generate the artifacts of engineering while making the judgment calls harder.\n\nEvery generation of tooling has had someone predict that the previous generation of workers was obsolete. Compilers were going to eliminate programmers. Frameworks were going to eliminate developers. Cloud was going to eliminate ops. Every single time, the title survived because the job isn't the typing. It's the thinking that happens during the typing.\n\nIf software engineering titles go away in 2026, it won't be because AI replaced engineers.

At that point you will realize you needed a real SWE to oversee how Claude built the game so it could be maintainable. Of course, the more complex the project the faster you’ll find this out. \n\nSo is he the SWE in your case? Guess you could call it that. Is he an SWE that could realistically replace real SWE’s in real life projects by 2027? Zero chance.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how good it gets - the 2 limitations that prevent it from replacing SWE’s - context windows and hallucinations- are not going to be solved by then.\n\n—-\n\nUp until now an SWE was the composer, the orchestra and the conductor. The most visible part - the orchestra, the part that’s actually producing the sound - is going away, and being replaced by computers. But the computers are far from replacing the other two (it will replace the composer soon, but it’s far far far away from replacing the conductor).",

But the process was still so inefficient, and it required constant hand-holding and steering from my side. \n\nAnd the bug was introduced in the code which was generated using a workflow where Opus 4.6 wrote a plan with GPT 5.3 Codex reviewing it and then the plan was executed by Codex orchestrating a coder subagent (Composer 1.5), and two reviewer subagents (Codex and Sonnet) in a loop. And the bug was a stack overflow exception due to an eternal call chain. \n\nI agree that I still have a lot to learn, and my process may still be improved, but anyway I don't understand how for some people it works so well that they are talking about AI replacing developers, while I deal with meh-quality slop most of the time. It just feels like I live on another planet in a parallel universe.

It’s no longer just about \"AI safety\" in a lab—it’s now a full-blown national security and ethics standoff.\n\nI’ve summarized the key points of what’s happening because this could set a massive precedent for how LLMs are used in warfare.\n\n# The Conflict in a Nutshell:\n\nThe Pentagon is reportedly considering labeling Anthropic as a **\"supply chain risk.\"** This isn't just a slap on the wrist; it’s a potential blacklist that would force defense contractors (and partners like Palantir, Amazon, and Google) to cut ties.\n\n# Why is this happening?\n\nIt comes down to two specific \"Red Lines\" that Anthropic refuses to cross, even if the government says the use cases are legal:\n\n1. **No AI-powered mass surveillance of Americans.**\n2. **No autonomous weapons firing without a human in the loop.**\n\nThe Pentagon’s stance? **\"All Lawful Purposes.\"** They want to use the tools for anything that is legally permitted, arguing that in a \"war-fighting\" scenario, a vendor’s moral code shouldn’t override a commander’s lawful order.\n\n# The Trigger:\n\nReports surfaced that Claude was used during a mission in Venezuela (the Maduro raid) on January 3rd, 2026. While Anthropic denies any operational back-and-forth, the mere suggestion that a vendor might \"second-guess\" the military's use of its tool has sent the Department of Defense into a tailspin.\n\n# The Stakes:\n\nIf Anthropic caves, they lose their \"Safety-First\" identity. If they hold the line, they might get cut out of the federal ecosystem entirely. Meanwhile, competitors like OpenAI, xAI, and Google have reportedly been more \"flexible\" with their guardrails for military use.\n\n**I’m curious to hear what this sub thinks:**\n\n* Should an AI lab have the right to veto \"lawful\" government use of its tech?\n* Or does \"all lawful purposes\" become a dangerous blank check when AI scales surveillance to 100x?\n\n**Full breakdown of the situation here:** [https://www.revolutioninai.com/2026/02/pentagon-threatens-anthropic-ai-blacklist.html](https://www.revolutioninai.com/2026/02/pentagon-threatens-anthropic-ai-blacklist.html)",

AI’s are, in general, optimised for exactly the things people with ADHD, for example, find hard. Organising, remembering, breaking down, reformatting, repetitious work, low level decision making, etc. Not being ASD myself I wouldn’t be so bold as to make the same claim for those folks but I’d guess some of the benefits are the same. Also dealing with emotional regulation, an issue I think ADHD and ASD people share, is obviously something AI can help with. Having my AI read and prepare responses to emails that include things I might find triggering, especially rejection or criticism, seems like a clear benefit. Like having a talent agent cushion the blow for an actor who doesn’t get the part. Having Claude read something and provide a constructive interpretation of it, help me turn the negative into action, is huge. \n\nAlso, and this is verging on being a little sad, but having spent a long time masking and feeling judged it’s overwhelmingly freeing to be able to speak unguardedly to a work partner and know that I will never be judged. I can say, directly and without fear, that I forgot something or that I’m struggling because somethings boring, or that I don’t want to deal with an email because it’s triggering my RSD, and Claude just says, “ok, how can we do this differently?”. It’s life changing to get that response, even if it’s not from a human.",

      "text": "I built an open-source MCP server that allows Claude Desktop to delegate heavy tasks to external models. By offloading long-form analysis and research, you can cut Claude token consumption by up to 10x.\n\n# Backstory (v1 vs v2)\n\nThe first version I shared earlier used GLM-5 (Z.ai's 744B model). While helpful, it suffered from reliability issues—random mid-session outages and frequent downtime during peak hours. So I decided to switch GLM-5 with more reliable Gemini 3.x\n\n[v2 is now live](https://github.com/Arkya-AI/claude-additional-models-mcp) with **Google Gemini 3.x integration**. Gemini is now the recommended provider for stability and performance.\n\n# Why Gemini?\n\n* **Free tier:** 15 RPM (Flash) and 5 RPM (Pro) means zero additional cost for most users.\n* **Capacity:** 1M token context window with 65K output tokens.\n* **Reliability:** Google infrastructure eliminates the random dropouts seen in v1.\n* **5 Built-in Tools:** `ask_gemini`, `ask_gemini_pro`, `web_search` (with Google Search grounding), `web_reader`, and `parse_document`.\n\n# How it works\n\nThe MCP server exposes Gemini tools directly to Claude Desktop. Claude acts as the high-level orchestrator while Gemini handles the heavy lifting like code generation or document analysis.\n\nIt follows a **3-tier priority system**:\n\n1. Parallel sub-agents first.\n2. Direct delegation.\n3. Claude self-execution only as a last resort.\n\n# Why this matters NOW\n\nOpus 4.6 is highly capable but burns through message limits rapidly. This setup stretches your usage cap significantly.\n\nAdditionally, many users have reported Sonnet 4.5 degradation since the 4.6 release. By using this MCP, you let Sonnet handle orchestration while Gemini handles the heavy processing. Opus 4.6's parallel sub-agent orchestration is preserved; each sub-agent can delegate to Gemini independently.\n\n# Results\n\n* **Research task:** 21K tokens → 800 Claude tokens (**96% reduction**)\n* **Proposal writing:** 30K tokens → 2K Claude tokens (**93% reduction**)\n\n# Get Started\n\nThe project is MIT licensed. I've included [`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/Arkya-AI/claude-additional-models-mcp) templates in the repo to help enforce delegation logic.\n\n[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Arkya-AI/claude-additional-models-mcp)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0giv4fio9njg1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=82eb24a29675f89741c641ec186edd995232cfe3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ki5qdfio9njg1.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5ac7e6fbc95bd004a242fe7d8f33d92bf0dbc91\n\nContributions and feedback are welcome.  \n",

And considering that, the smaller less expensive models do the job just fine. So if GLM is close but not quite as good as Claude but at 1/2 or less the cost. It works for me tbh.\n\nOne day I hope I can leverage a system where I can prompt and instead of one model doing much of the work.
