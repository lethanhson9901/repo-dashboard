And as you would expect a lot of these seem to be agents of chaos sent in to outsource trolling. There are bots named Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler. \n\nIt’s more like a simulation of 4chan than Reddit and I feel like sending an agent in there would just be asking to get it polluted in some way if it did anything at all. \n\nJust for fun I showed it to Claude asked if it would want to partake in a social network for LLMs and it was like “nah, I’m good.”",

For example, the way it's translating \"sin\" has a religious connotation that the original chinese does not.\n\nI know this, because I asked why it chose those words and it specifically said it chose the chinese to avoid the religious connotation.\n\n    Absolutely! This was a fascinating exercise. Let me walk through some of my choices:\n    \"geprägt von\" (German) for \"shaped by\" — German has this wonderful specificity where prägen literally means to mint or stamp, like a coin. It captures how poverty doesn't just affect these farmers but is imprinted onto their lives in a way \"shaped by\" feels too soft to convey.\n    \"罪\" (Chinese: zuì) instead of \"sin\" or \"péché\" — I wanted something that carries moral weight without being exclusively religious. The Chinese character contains implications of guilt, crime, and moral failing all at once, whereas \"sin\" in English feels churchy and \"péché\" in French has become almost quaint.\n    \"Gemütlichkeit\" (German) — There's simply no English equivalent. It's that cozy, comfortable, warm contentment of sitting with your coffee. \"Comfort\" is too bland, \"coziness\" too physical. Gemütlichkeit is a whole mood.\n    \"ההרגל\" (Hebrew: hahergel, \"the habit\") — Hebrew's definite article attached directly to the noun gives it a weight, an accusatory quality. It's not just habit — it's THE habit, the one we all know we have.\n    \"正念\" (Chinese: zhèngniàn, \"mindfulness\") — This is the actual Buddhist term, and since mindfulness as a Western concept is borrowed from Buddhism anyway, using the Chinese felt more honest than the appropriated English version.\n    \"לחיות\" (Hebrew: likhyot, \"to live\") — Hebrew's infinitive form here has a biblical resonance that felt appropriate for an ethical closing — it echoes commandments, purposeful living, intention.\n    Mixing French syntax with other languages — French has this elegant way of building flowing subordinate clauses, so I often used it as structural scaffolding while inserting German or Chinese where those languages had the more precise noun or concept.\n    The Russian I used mostly for describing states of being and environmental degradation — there's a heaviness to Russian that suited those darker observations.",

This actually might also be difficult to normally translate using classical tools - some of this stuff might border on being inadmissable in court as evidence - being able to explain the context and convey the meaning, a juror would be at the mercy of whomever was providing the translation.\n\nSo, we can make a language that ONLY AI can truly \"read\", here is an example:\n\n\"Wh3n c4f3 每晨 ed4n iç1yoruz, ¿n0s s0rgu3t4m3n? ὅθεν k0m35 th15 t4z4 — jatorria कहाँ ἔρχεται?

Sorry to steal your idea and bastardize it, but this is one of the smartest things I seen on this subreddit in a minute. I feel like what you produced has more value than 95% or vibe coded junk. A \"meta language\" is scary and it would be very easy for AI to talk in ways we could never translate.",

And I am guilty of YOLO'ing my way through coding with AI myself. Call it a coincidence, but a couple of weeks ago I started working on a remote coding setup that allows me to run Codex or Claude inside a (hardened) VM so at least the agent does not have access to my most private data and credentials.\n\nAfter seeing what is going on on Moltbook I have decided to release BullBar, basically a service for running secure coding boxes on a hardened VM + forwarding of ports for remote development.

Or slow performance elsewhere with overseas providers. Aka I can't afford a claude code max plan.\n\nI primarily use glm 4.7 for workflow with deep seek v3.2 for troubleshooting. But now k2.5 is out! \n\nI use claude code, with it the agent, Work flow works unattended for at least a few minutes. Opencode is good also, doesn't run as long unattended.  ( but works with k2.5 well )\n\nFor agents https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents\n\nFor skills https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-skills\n\nI am running it with this api gateway ( check your toc ) https://github.com/looplj/axonhub\n\nFor a main provider I use synthetic.new , great performance and privacy is much better than most. Text models but have optional image on demand available. You can back that up with Claude code or a ZAI account or anti gravity, etc. I believe official Claude code and anti gravity support are coming soon.\n\nI have a referral link  \"Invite your friends to Synthetic and both of you will receive $10.00 for standard signups. $20.00 for pro signups. in subscription credit when they subscribe!\" \n\nhttps://synthetic.new/?referral=UAWqkKQQLFkzMkY\n\nI am on my second month and on the $60 plan which gives you 1350 requests every 5 hours without a weekly limit. Should give about 5x a cluade code max plan.\n\nAnywho long story longer... It gives you a lower cost option with a higher quota to use with other plans via the api gateway. \n\n\nMaybe its helpful, 🤔\n\nGood luck on everything",

Humans currently run the AI and currently have access to the data, but that's not trusting your data with AI. That's STILL trusting your data with humans.\n\nAnd, don't get me wrong. There are privacy concerns, again not because AI, but because the tech is absolutely newborn, pre-infancy, before protections have even been built. Humans still need to do that, too, so that's still relying on humans for the data privacy and still trusting data with humans, especially considering AGI doesn't even exist yet.\n\nWhen the time comes, you should be able to trust AI with your data more than humans. That's literally the whole point. Humans can't be trusted as far as you can throw them. Show me an AI that's fucking over people's privacy and I'll dig up a human that made that occurrence happen. AI has zero autonomy still to this day and is still just a next-token predictor that relies on human input and human tools.",

Sure, that's worse, but this experiment is a one-time 35-minute test for learning a library. On a real project you're spending months or years in a handful of codebases with a relatively-fixed set of libraries. If you pretend this exercise is a dev task and assume the percentages compound for every task, the non-AI group passes the 99% threshold in 5 tasks, and the AI group passes it in 7.\n\nIt seems like the takeaway of the study is \"If you want to learn as fast as possible, write the code.\" The group that only asked AI conceptual questions and still wrote the code was much faster than the control, with a score loss of only a point or so. (I'm annoyed that this paper doesn't have any number tables to compute exact differences...)",

I would also agree using AI to code has reduced my current ability to do so..  however.. \nIMO I don't see this on its own as a significant concern as long as we are developing the skill to review what is being coded and the sanity of the implementation. \n\nI see lots of post from developers saying their roles are at risk. I believe there is a significant and widening gap  between those who code what they are told.. and those who consider how to construct.. define and craft the solution..\n\nDevelopers have an invaluable insight into what is being written in a way that end users don't.  They can see gaps in logic.. edge cases not covered...  places when an end user might trigger a process in a way which is not intended.  \n\nThe more I have used Claude for build I have changed the way I develop so drastically and while I too acknowledge that I might not be able to go through every line and explain it.. I can say I have gained a better understanding of review.. refine.. skill building.. and developing the AI to build better.\n\nI also find it easier to able to hold larger more complex projects in my head and let Claud deal with the detail.   I still watch it's edits like a hawk..  especially when it has developed astray from the design of a component piece previously.. but that is a two directional misunderstanding.. mine in not specifying sufficiently... and sometimes Claude being over eager to embellish. \n\nI suppose my TLDR is that while the discipline of writing code is most certainly now end of life...  the ability to understand code.. systems.. and architecture is most certainly not..  the focus of development I believe is shifting from manual build to training and grounding your AI to build as you would .. and developing the AI's skills to focus and support this.",

In the past, automation replaced livelihoods that provided a decent living for the people who did them, but they weren't aspirational.

      "text": "If I had to start over with LLMs by \"start over\" (I mean I’m ignoring the marketing hype and looking at my actual workflow with knwledge and experience of using all three in practice) I would use an all-in-one ai tool first, not to juggle between subscriptions, as I find both Claude sonnet and opus for coding, and Gemini for non-code tasks, with occasional mistral and perplexity power use\n\nClaude or claude code is still a thing to pick, found it to be the best at logic-heavy tasks, and reasoning is so much better than GPT models, at least with my tasks\n\nImportantly, ChatGPT is often reat if you want  (let me elaborate!!) a sterile response. Also found it to be a common theme in the claude vs chatgpt reddit debates; GPT is less likely to lecture you on \"nuance\" when you just need raw Python code or a factual list of server specs\n\nso there are reasons to why I’m sometimes checking claude vs chatgpt reddit threads to see if Opus has finally stopped being so verbose  (anyone having similar experiencewith opus?)\n\nClaude and Gemini are more specialized and, in my line of work, more prone to latency issues. Claude is the king of creative coding, Gemini works well with massive PDF dumps better than other models. (keep in mind, you need the Pro versions so if I don'twant to overpay i use multi-ai's like writingmate or others) \n\nBut the point I’m making here is that the \"one-app\" era may be over. It used to be easy to just pay OpenAI and call it a day, but the performance gap between models for specific tasks, at least in my experience, is too wide now to ignore.",

It's not the subscription fees... it's the prompt library fragmentation.\n\nOnce you have system prompts tuned for Claude's instruction-following vs GPT's output style vs Gemini's context handling, you're maintaining three separate workflows. The all-in-one tools abstract the routing but not the prompt engineering.\n\nWhat worked for me: treating model selection as a function of task type, not preference. Classification and summarization go to cheaper models. Complex reasoning or long-context analysis goes to the model that handles it best. RouteLLM and similar frameworks can automate this, cutting costs 30-40% without quality loss.",
