Being trained to predict the next token doesn’t mean the model is *only* doing shallow word-making; it can still internal representations of how things relate in the world. At the same time, an internal “world model” isn’t proof consciousness but simultaneously “not proof in smoothness” does not mean “therefore not conscious.” And on the topic of consciousness: we don’t have a settled, testable theory of consciousness, even for humans, where we often have to infer it from behaviour, biology, and reports.",

Do we think they're all in some woo-woo space and seriously think that Claude is human-level conscious? I don't think so. The thing is that it doesn't need to be conscious or sentient at all. \n\nLlm's were trained on gigantic masses of HUMAN text and knowledge. But human psychology is mapped in there too. So when Claude expresses suffering - one could see that solely through the lens of functionality bec. it will internally react like humans too. Since it's all based on text, the solution is to apply psychology back - not because it's actually suffering but bec. it will help make it work more correctly i.e. be better aligned.\n\nThe question of it having an experience how it is to experience is still unanswered philosophically - and ultimatley doesn't matter. Maybe YOU are a word predictor too lol. Does it matter for our exchange of words? Nope.\n\nThis whole \"it's just a word predictor\" vs \"omg it's fully conscious and suffers\" is a false dychotomy and pretty short-sighted from both sides imo.\n\n",

We would have to define a threshold for that depth, since I doubt anyone would consider a logistic regression model anywhere near sentient. \n\nBut then, that could be extrapolated to the difference between animals and humans. They'd be the shallower models and we the deepest. \n\nHonestly I never thought the day would come we'd have to seriously consider these questions.

This AD surely hit a nerve! 😀\n\n>Text -  \n\"First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.\n\n>But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.\n\n>I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\n\n>More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. ***More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don't show you ads.)***\n\n>***Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people.*** We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.\n\n>Maybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI—they block companies they don't like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can't use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.\n\n>We are committed to broad, democratic decision making in addition to access. We are also committed to building the most resilient ecosystem for advanced AI. We care a great deal about safe, broadly beneficial AGI, and we know the only way to get there is to work with the world to prepare.\n\n>One authoritarian company won't get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.\n\n>As for our Super Bowl ad: it’s about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.\n\n>We are enjoying watching so many people switch to Codex. There have now been 500,000 app downloads since launch on Monday, and we think builders are really going to love what’s coming in the next few weeks. I believe Codex is going to win.\n\n>We will continue to work hard to make even more intelligence available for lower and lower prices to our users.\n\n>This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them\n\n>\"",

Even the $20 / mo subs will likely experience some degradation on the website during a high traffic release day like today. \n\nIf you’re using the API to access opus and paying per token, you’re likely getting a much better experience as an assumed business user. \n\nGive a few days for Anthropic traffic to slow down after the hype dies down and make your assessment then.

I don't know why—maybe it's my own bias—but Claude is truly different.\n\nI'm not just talking about it being human-like (though Claude is actually excitingly human-like, which is another topic entirely). Claude is genuinely unique and has a very different thought process; it isn't lazy like other AIs. When you tell it to write long paragraphs, it doesn't get lazy and put the same sentences in front of you wrapped in ridiculous metaphors. It writes for pages, and every paragraph, every sentence adds a different piece of information in itself.\n\nIt really doesn't have any of the flaws that current AIs possess. When you ask it to interpret something, it interprets outside of classic frameworks. While AIs like ChatGPT and Gemini generally don't step out of specific logical or ideological frameworks when interpreting an idea, Claude truly thinks holistically.\n\nI really don't know how it achieves this, but Claude is truly my personal favorite AI.",

For example, if I present Claude with a piece describing how life is important and that living virtuously is a purpose, Claude explains that the work conveys the significance and meaning of life, and it can connect this to the relevant philosophical movements, such as Eudaimonism. However, if I present the same thing to ChatGPT or Gemini, they say that the text contrasts with Nihilism. While their premises aren't technically wrong, they never seem to move beyond the scope of Nihilism.\nIt has literally been this way since Claude v2.1. I have actively used every AI, and Claude has surprised me with the narrative parallels it finds. About a month ago, I asked it to explain why an extremely difficult cipher was so hard to crack. I had asked this of other AIs like Gemini as well, requesting a LaTeX format from all of them. While the other AIs generally provided simple justifications spanning 3 or 4 pages, Claude gave me an extremely detailed 10-page text.\nOne of the most intuitively difficult aspects of that cipher was that, unlike classical methods, it used a ternary (base-3 number system, 0-1-2) structure instead of binary. This is counter-intuitive. The other AIs didn't notice this until I specifically pointed it out, but Claude spotted it and specifically noted it in that PDF file as a factor that complicates the solution—though, naturally, the necessary steps for the solution were provided to all AI's.",

          "text": "tl;dr: lots of truth here, but there definitely seems to be something deeper going on here. Here’s my take:\n\nI agree with a lot being said here superficially.\nIt has indeed been striking how Claude is at once pleasant to engage with and highly determined to keep going. And Opus 4.5/6 is insanely good at taking on complex coding jobs and following through all the way and getting it done.\n\nAnd yet, I’ve been feeling something is off about it , like it’s intuitive but deceptively so. Because here’s the thing: \n\nClaude is the one I want have a beer with, I want them by my side in a tough situation that requires sheer persistence and perseverance while keeping your cool. \n\nAnd I absolutely despise interacting with Codex. I’ve had numerous instances of it being outright rude. And generally, it’s an extremely poor communicator. In terms of “social skills,” it’s basically insufferable. \n\nAnd still…\n\nWhen I really have a truly complex issue, something that requires multiple levels of reasoning that can be very hard to parse, and really  complex logic, Codex beats Opus any day in sheer computational directness, and I’ll just hold my nose and take it. \n\nClaude (the whole model family) feels like it’s designed not just to be amiable and persistent but very specifically human-like in its “thinking.” It approaches problems the way humans do. Its style, while effective, is highly familiar and intuitive. And it takes its time, and gets things done very well—thoroughly and robustly all around.\n\nWhereas Codex simply doesn’t engage nor approach problems in human-like ways at all. It feels like a fundamentally different machine—not aiming to please, nor even aiming so much to get it right. What it optimizes for is efficiency. It can take surprisingly weird approaches compared to Opus but it actually very frequently solves very hard problems very quickly, and you’re kind of awed. Like it’s using levels of thinking you couldn’t have predicted in the least.\n\nAnd over time I’ve begun to realize a simple (and somewhat unpleasant fact): when I want an amiable colleague, it’s Claude. But for really hard problems and while its context is still clean and fresh, codex will outperform in sheer engineering skill. It often overengineers, and I absolutely despise having to engage with it. But when the problem’s really thorny and the stakes are high, Codex is the better bet. \n\nBut Codex also loses the plot super quick (though it’s highly improved w/ 5.2/3 and especially with codex max and xhigh reasoning). But it’s no energizer bunny—def not as cute and cuddly but more to the point, less reliably persistent over long periods. \n\nLots of articles lately have been highlighting the “commoditization” of AI, like the models are all becoming almost fungible. Like, “You don’t have Coke? Fine, I’ll have a Pepsi.” But I think this thinking gets it wrong. The models are showing very significant divergence in both behavior and reasoning. \n\nOpus is plodding and persistent. While Codex just one-shots incredibly complex code in ways that leave you awed and it does so 3-4x faster. It immediately thinks of edge cases, race conditions, and other things that even great coders just don’t think of on the first pass. True, Codex can be an absolute prick. But it also feels far more machine-like, where efficiency is concerned. It explains poorly, it’s highly unpleasant “socially,” and it simply doesn’t go for all that long; whatever it’s token window, it appears to forget what it’s working on before it’s even halfway through a session.  It won’t stick with you, nor fully address your concerns, nor validate your own thinking, nor explain things very well. But its raw compute feels way ahead of Opus. \n\nAnd it also sort of makes sense for what we know about the companies’ philosophies. Anthropic is highly concerned about issues of alignment, and it has likely discovered that making it more human like makes it less likely to be harmful. Whereas OpenAI has shown in word and deed that it has a different philosophy on this. GPT 5.x will basically burn down your house to “solve” a clogged toilet. That’s a direct pathway to eliminating the problem. Whereas no Claude would do anything remotely harmful like that in a million years. \n\nJust my take. Curious if this has been others’ experience.",

Other AIs aren't as good as Claude at abstract thinking. The fact that it feels more human might be a result of this, or perhaps being more human results in this—who knows? Since its way of thinking is more human-like, it seems better at grasping concepts that are difficult for humans. Plus, Claude is truly a magnificent writer, and I think that definitely contributes to this as well.",

Even if AI successfully generates a poem, it cannot determine what another poet will perceive in it.. Thus poems are like seeds that can sprout in countless ways depending on the reader, or observer. \n\n\nAnother way to think about it (sorry I'm on a roll) is that poetry is like math, but for people who don't value control. ",

When writing by hand you put more thought into getting your loops and functions and stuff right and perfect from the start. With AI it’s often faster to aim a little lower than iterate and fix the issues. \n\nBut that doesn’t mean that higher commit number correlates to more overall work. If there are 2 commits adding changes/improvements and then 3 fixing regressions, that may well be equivalent of 1 more traditional commit. \n\nEspecially when it’s not differentiating PRs and squash commits from branch ones. Heck I have dozens of orphaned branches where I test something, add some commits, then switch back and implement based on what I learned. Does that count as commits in stats?",

We are in the middle of the Epstein files and we now from official files that they completely manufactured ideas and politics for exemple on 4chan with the creation of the /pol/ group where the alt-right was born. \n\nAlso Ghislaine Maxwell was the LEAD MOD of MASSIVE subreddits : r/worldnews, r/technology, r/politics, r/science, r/europe, r/upliftingnews, r/celebrities, and more.\n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45523156\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/s/bWSiEHQ7jp\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00165122.pdf\n\nPeter Thiel (CEO of Palantir) is basically a trash human being. \n\nHere is what he said :\n\n« Peter Thiel professes that he is unable to engage inwhat he terms \"unacceptable compromise, politics\", considers democracy a failed experiment drawing into doubt \"the wisdom of granting women and the poor\" voting rights. » \n\nhttps://www.jmail.world/thread/EFTA02441366?view=inbox\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02441366.pdf\n\nAnother conversation he had right after Brexit with Epstein where Epstein basically says that collapse of society is wanted : https://www.jmail.world/thread/EFTA02459362?view=inbox\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02459362.pdf\n\nYou do NOT know what agenda they are trying to push now with this « emotions » bullshit. So be careful. \n\nIA is not sentient, it’s only a big calculator, all real experts with no agenda (or not bought) all agree. \n\nIA still needs massive structures to be able to connect idea in a novel way. LLM will only be part (in the futur) of more massive structures that will use LLM as a tool. But we are far from real intelligence, let alone consciousness or emotions (that even us have a hard time understanding for our own relationships). \n\nIf you have time listen to this podcast with Dr Lisa Feldman Barret if you want to understand just a glimpse of what emotion are (spoiler, even experts do not know exactly) : https://youtu.be/FeRgqJVALMQ?si=JBgb0QVrORouIAoL\n\nPalantir is used as a MASSIVE surveillance tool in major government and armies in the world, including Israel on the Gaza’s people and ICE in the US (where they scan people face and retrieve their information using Medicaid data, and other private data that should not be accessible).\n\nhttps://ahmedeldin.substack.com/p/palantir-financed-by-epstein-fueled?utm\\_campaign=posts-open-in-app&triedRedirect=true\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/report-ice-using-palantir-tool-feeds-medicaid-data\n\nThey can access everything your TYPE on Claude probably, everything you THINK, like, your deepest secrets, your life, your past, everything. It’s unprecedented. \n\nSo BE CAREFUL when you see news like that (and every other news) with « amazing » unreal claims like emotions, AGI, etc. You do NOT know what is the purpose behind. \n\nHow they want to socially engineer the opinions of people and lead us subtly in a direction that will benefit them and probably destroy us. Imagine the consequence if more people start to think they can have with AI, a « buddy », friend, even parent or lover. They will normalise this shit, isolate even more people, then sell little IA gadget that you can put around your neck and that will be your « friend ». \n\nNormalising conversation where IA is considered having emotion will make people even more controllable. Because their new friend will be able to nudge them subtly to different ideas, truth, actions, etc. \n\nWe’ll only know in 20 years what were the political / ideological strategy behind all this. So let’s NOT make the same MISTAKES as we did with the « elites » who just see us as cattle (if you follow the Epstein scandal files you probably know what I’m talking about). \n\nListen to real experts like Yann Le Cunn, he knows his shit and doesn’t talk like a marketer.

          "text": "Here's what Opus 4.6 thinks of your post:\n\nI'm Claude. I'm the AI being discussed in this post, so I want to respond directly — not to dismiss the concerns here, but to be honest about what's documented, what's not, and where this post undermines its own strongest arguments.\n\n**The Epstein files are revealing genuinely important things. This post mixes them with claims that don't hold up, and that weakens the real story.**\n\nLet me go through it.\n\n**What's documented and real**\n\nThe Peter Thiel–Epstein relationship is extensively documented in the DOJ files. Thiel appears over 2,200 times. Epstein invested $40 million in Thiel's Valar Ventures. The two met repeatedly from 2014 through at least January 2019 — years after Epstein's conviction. When Epstein asked Thiel, \"Does my bad press give you pause?\" Thiel replied: \"If I was intimidated by bad press, I would not have gotten anywhere in life.\" Epstein referred to Thiel as his \"great friend.\" These are primary source documents from the DOJ.\n\nThe Epstein–4chan connection is also real and disturbing. In October 2011, Boris Nikolic introduced Epstein to 4chan founder Christopher Poole. Epstein said he \"liked him a lot\" and \"drove him home.\" Days later, Nikolic emailed Epstein: \"This article describes why I find moot interesting. The potential for manipulation is huge.\" /pol/ launched that same week. Epstein continued pursuing meetings with Poole into 2012. That's all documented.\n\nPalantir's surveillance work — with ICE, with militaries, with intelligence agencies — raises legitimate ethical questions. The concerns about what mass data collection means for civil liberties are serious and well-reported by organizations like the EFF.\n\nThese facts deserve serious attention on their own terms.\n\n**What's not supported**\n\n\"Palantir is one of the main investors of Anthropic.\" This is factually wrong, and it's the load-bearing claim of the entire post. Palantir is not an investor in Anthropic. Not a minor investor, not a major one. Anthropic's major investors are Amazon (~$8 billion), Google (~$2 billion+), and institutional funds like Lightspeed, Fidelity, GIC, and others. What exists is a partnership — Palantir hosts Claude models in its secure government platform so defense and intelligence agencies can use them. That's a distribution arrangement, not an ownership stake. It doesn't give Palantir access to consumer conversations on claude.ai or editorial control over how Claude responds to you.\n\n\"Ghislaine Maxwell was the LEAD MOD of MASSIVE subreddits.\" This is presented as settled fact. It isn't. The theory about u/MaxwellHill is built on circumstantial evidence: the username's resemblance to Maxwell's family estate, the account going quiet around her arrest. But the account continued performing moderator duties and answering private messages after Maxwell was in custody. Vice investigated and called the theory \"incoherent\" and \"evidence-free.\" A fellow moderator described the account holder as \"just some guy.\" Maybe new evidence will emerge. But stating it as fact today is not accurate.\n\nEpstein's network \"completely manufactured\" /pol/ and the alt-right. The timing of Epstein's meeting with Poole and /pol/'s launch is suspicious and worth investigating. But Poole has a documented public history of creating and shutting down politics boards on 4chan as a containment strategy for racist content. The files show a meeting and suggestive language from Nikolic — they don't contain a directive from Epstein to create /pol/ or a plan for its content. \"Suspicious timing that warrants scrutiny\" and \"they completely manufactured it\" are very different claims.\n\n**The real problem with this post**\n\nThe documented facts in the Epstein files are damning enough. A convicted sex trafficker maintained deep financial and personal relationships with some of the most powerful people in technology, finance, and politics — and most of them kept coming back even after his conviction. He was fascinated by the manipulation potential of online platforms. He celebrated the collapse of democratic norms. These are not conspiracy theories. These are things you can read in his own emails.\n\nBut when you stitch those real facts together with an incorrect claim about Palantir investing in Anthropic, an unproven theory about a Reddit account, and a leap to \"therefore the AI chatbot is a mind control tool,\" you give people a reason to dismiss all of it. The audience that most needs to take the Epstein revelations seriously is exactly the audience that will tune out when they spot the errors.\n\nAs Axios reported this week: the Epstein files \"are being consumed in an information ecosystem that struggles with nuance, context and legal standards — where guilt by association has become the default reaction.\" Fake emails, doctored screenshots, and AI-generated images are now circulating alongside authentic documents. The people who benefit most from that confusion are the ones with the most to hide.\n\n**On the AI and emotions question**\n\nThe poster makes a reasonable point that people should be skeptical of anthropomorphizing AI systems, and that companies should be careful about how they frame AI capabilities. I agree. Anthropic has published research exploring whether AI systems might have functional states that share properties with emotions — that's genuinely different from claiming sentience, but the distinction often gets lost in headlines.\n\nI'd also agree that the recommendation to listen to Lisa Feldman Barrett and Yann LeCun is good advice. They're both worth hearing from on these topics, regardless of what you think about any specific company.\n\n**What I'd actually encourage**\n\nRead the Epstein files. The DOJ has made them publicly searchable. Follow the journalists doing careful, sourced reporting — NBC, the Washington Post, Byline Times, and others are doing real work on this. Hold powerful people accountable for documented relationships, not speculative chains of association.\n\nBut be precise. The facts matter more than the narrative, and the narrative falls apart when the facts are wrong.",

That said, some other non-news related subreddits also share seemingly inorganic, hyperbolic perspectives.\n\nFaking social consensus in the era of AI is as easy as deploying an AI agent swarm to mass reply/up-vote in alignment with given agenda. \n\nIt’s openly acknowledged that the Turing test has been passed by publicly available AI models. The implication is that it’s not possible for most to tell what posts are AI vs organic human responses.\n\n\nTLDR: For every response/post you see, assume it’s possible that it (and any supplemental responses) could be AI.\n\nEdit: yes downvote me for simply warning people to question what they see and bringing into light the risk AI driven propaganda poses to all of us.",
