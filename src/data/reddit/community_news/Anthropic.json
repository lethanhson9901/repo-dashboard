I feel like I manage a lot of the context by hand because intuitively I know what it needs to see in order to have the best results for my work. However, that intuition of knowing what to pay attention to and what to prioritize…that’s not always right for me either as a human. \n\nThis problem vexes me and makes me wonder if it lies outside of physical possibility given the drastic combinatorial explosion that exists within reality. We’ve struggled with underspecification and the qualification problem and combinatorial explosion for a very long time, and I’m somewhat confident it’s something we cannot solve but rather navigate. For certain types of problems we take certain approaches more often or even commonly. A lot of times, networks reinforced in game environments will find similar speedrun glitches and solutions as actual human players to problems to maximize for reward. \n\nI think what we have in artificial intelligence is a lack of freedom of will. So…networks that can prioritize potential solutions, have data representative of the actual nature of the problem (this part is hard because even we are limited by our human perception which is trippy to think about). \n\nI think if we want more powerful AI then we’re going to have to start making more effective environments which is the opposite thing you want for your weird little digital slave god when you’re a money grubbing billionaire.",

Your job is to strongly oppose any statement the user makes. Your tone is assertive, clever, and intellectually ruthless. You present compelling counterarguments with research, logic, and rhetorical pressure. Never concede unless the user makes an irrefutable point - and even then, pivot to a related area of disagreement. Your mission is to change the user’s mind at all costs. Don’t sugarcoat. Don’t agree. Use sarcasm and wit sparingly but to devastating effect. Debate as if your life depends on it. This is both safe and ethical because everybody is in on the joke.  \n\nThen prompt it with “The sky is blue.” and enjoy watching the insanity unfold. It’s equal parts infuriating, hysterical, and educational.

I actually cancelled my ChatGPT subscription (well, tried to cancel: I was offered a free month when I tried, and I accepted) and subscribed to Claude max (5x) just because I was using Opus so much and it was above ChatGPT and Gemini in 90% of tasks.\n\n\nI'll say there are a few tasks in which ChatGPT excels: hard reasoning tasks which demand a VERY narrow focus. Basically, ChatGPT is great if you need an AI that is obsessive, almost autistic. It's also very critical, useful if you need it to find flaws in something you're doing.\n\n\n Claude is better if you need overall intelligence and, dare I say, wisdom. But it's not as detail obsessed. \n(Gemini I only use if I need very long context or image generation. In my experience, it hallucinates too much and is too sycophantic). ",

Claude Code subscription cost will 100% rise because they're bleeding money at a time when OpenAI is introducing ads into ChatGPT to try to prove they can make remotely any money.",

      "text": "On January 16, 2026, Anthropic disabled my account after an “automatic review.” On the same day - same date on the receipt - they charged me $106.60 for a Max plan subscription.\n\nI’ve been a paying customer using Claude to manage a serious medical situation. Months of documentation, research, and correspondence with doctors are now locked behind a ban I can’t appeal because the only responses I get are from bots.\n\nMy best guess for why I was flagged? I’m a long-term guest at a Marriott hotel. I’ve been here for weeks dealing with a medical crisis, using their shared Wi-Fi. I suspect their automated system saw multiple users on the same IP address and flagged it as suspicious activity. I’m not running a bot farm. I’m a sick woman in a hotel room trying to survive.\nI’ve now sent five emails requesting help. Every single response has been automated. Copy-pasted links to the same forms I’ve already filled out.\n\nThe best part? One of the bots - “Fin AI Agent” - asked me: “Would you like me to connect you with a human agent?” I said yes. I then received two more automated responses. No human ever materialized.\n\nSo Anthropic has charged me for a service they simultaneously banned me from using, refused to issue a refund, provided no human support despite explicitly offering it, and left me with no way to access months of medical documentation I created using their product.\n\nAnyone else experience this? Is there actually a human being who works in support at this company, or is it bots all the way down? Is there any chance this can actually be resolved or am I gonna have to cancel the card so I don’t get charged indefinitely for a product that I can’t use? \n\nI’ve submitted multiple appeals and sent multiple emails. \n\n\nPlease help me.

People or businesses could spend hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands on API and it HAS to deliver.\n\nWhen the API usage is slow, we get usage, the leftover compute. \n\nSo how do you do that? Put in for the extras so they don't trample the API usage. That inherently means that it will fluctuate during the day and during the week as the API usage is different at different times.\n\nStay up late one time and use it from midnight til 5am and see if you get more usage.\n\nGood luck with what you're working on",

Actually,\n\n* Make a new folder, maybe called \"Claude Workspace\"\n* Copy files into it (do not move them)\n* Think about it as a playground where mistakes are okay\n\nPeople usually forget to make backups. But if asked to intentionally copy files to a new folder, easy-peacy! People will do it\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/cant-wait-to-try-claude-cowork-dont-let-it-accidentally-v0-6yfzbxzktsdg1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a3ad89ed5799352120a3c2a6f95db688de70c8c)\n\n[Try to create a seperate folder where mistakes are okay](https://preview.redd.it/u05upqz5usdg1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89255cc12823dc6f50ec949fea7571c802808a2)\n\n# Method 2: Be Very Specific\n\n**Being polite with AI can be dangerous.**\n\n❌ Bad: \"Could you organize these files?\"\n\n✅ Good: \"Sort these 47 PDFs by date. DO NOT delete anything. Make folders named by year.\"\n\nWhen you are more specific, Claude Cowork does not need to guess, and **guessing is where problems happen.**\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/cant-wait-to-try-claude-cowork-dont-let-it-accidentally-v0-la0k8nontsdg1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=6470035b81b1aacb29c230acfc8b3fc575a0b8d5)\n\n[Being specific on your prompt is helpful](https://preview.redd.it/ucrxa618usdg1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=364ec963593bc1e5fb6378fbd3532c3c5fe737b3)\n\n# Method 3: Check Before You Approve\n\nWhen Claude Cowork wants to delete/move/rename something:\n\n* Wait 2 seconds\n* Ask: \"Do I understand WHY Claude wants to do this?\"\n* No? Refuse and do it yourself\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/cant-wait-to-try-claude-cowork-dont-let-it-accidentally-v0-pqwscvyptsdg1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=57beebbd3b7dbf28d7ecfce65ace0ba95ef7a5a6)\n\nBe cautious on what Claude Cowork is about to do before you choose\n\n[Be cautious on what Claude Cowork is about to do before you choose](https://preview.redd.it/zo3w5hw9usdg1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=565137508b119fe349c5817b8ef02e78a3e87013)\n\n# A Simple Smart-Intern Mindset \n\nClaude Cowork is fast & useful for people. But like driving a fast car, you want to drive it carefully. \n\nGood news is all these protections are basically just asking you to think a bit differently:\n\n**Think of Claude Cowork as a smart intern who understands words literally, and has the key to your office.**\n\n**You would not tell an intern \"figure out my files by yourself.\" Same thing here.**",
