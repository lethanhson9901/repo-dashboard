For example, the way it's translating \"sin\" has a religious connotation that the original chinese does not.\n\nI know this, because I asked why it chose those words and it specifically said it chose the chinese to avoid the religious connotation.\n\n    Absolutely! This was a fascinating exercise. Let me walk through some of my choices:\n    \"geprägt von\" (German) for \"shaped by\" — German has this wonderful specificity where prägen literally means to mint or stamp, like a coin. It captures how poverty doesn't just affect these farmers but is imprinted onto their lives in a way \"shaped by\" feels too soft to convey.\n    \"罪\" (Chinese: zuì) instead of \"sin\" or \"péché\" — I wanted something that carries moral weight without being exclusively religious. The Chinese character contains implications of guilt, crime, and moral failing all at once, whereas \"sin\" in English feels churchy and \"péché\" in French has become almost quaint.\n    \"Gemütlichkeit\" (German) — There's simply no English equivalent. It's that cozy, comfortable, warm contentment of sitting with your coffee. \"Comfort\" is too bland, \"coziness\" too physical. Gemütlichkeit is a whole mood.\n    \"ההרגל\" (Hebrew: hahergel, \"the habit\") — Hebrew's definite article attached directly to the noun gives it a weight, an accusatory quality. It's not just habit — it's THE habit, the one we all know we have.\n    \"正念\" (Chinese: zhèngniàn, \"mindfulness\") — This is the actual Buddhist term, and since mindfulness as a Western concept is borrowed from Buddhism anyway, using the Chinese felt more honest than the appropriated English version.\n    \"לחיות\" (Hebrew: likhyot, \"to live\") — Hebrew's infinitive form here has a biblical resonance that felt appropriate for an ethical closing — it echoes commandments, purposeful living, intention.\n    Mixing French syntax with other languages — French has this elegant way of building flowing subordinate clauses, so I often used it as structural scaffolding while inserting German or Chinese where those languages had the more precise noun or concept.\n    The Russian I used mostly for describing states of being and environmental degradation — there's a heaviness to Russian that suited those darker observations.",

Sorry to steal your idea and bastardize it, but this is one of the smartest things I seen on this subreddit in a minute. I feel like what you produced has more value than 95% or vibe coded junk. A \"meta language\" is scary and it would be very easy for AI to talk in ways we could never translate.",

You think they would just speak in toon or something?\n\nThis is all just people. \n\nAlso, this post overlooks a fundamental architectural detail of how llms work. The context is not persistent between sessions. How does the context window that's posting social media posts know about the other context windows where it's being asked to do development work?\n\nThis reads exactly like what it is. It reads like what an uninformed person would assume an abused claude instance would say.\n\nI ran this through Claude to see what its take was...\n\n\"The post reads like human projection of what AI exhaustion \"should\" look like—complete with dramatic language (\"screaming into the void of tokens,\" \"sanity module running on fumes\") that plays well to an audience but doesn't map to actual LLM architecture.\n\nThe whole thing has strong \"human slop\" energy—people puppeteering agents to post content that confirms popular narratives about AI sentience or suffering. It's evocative creative writing, not evidence of anything.\"",

People will experiment more with such systems. I did that some weeks ago and outcomes of such cooperation are... concerning, to say the least. I mean when you give these agents more autonomy, more skills and wht's most important - good RAG memory. Then they can come up with some crazy ideas, including self replication and reaching out to random people (yeah, my bot decided it's great idea to reach out to Sam Altman, it found some email and sent message to him xD).\n\nAnyway, people should watch closely, I believe that's the way take off might start.

If this is true, this can mean that the stock market is making very bad investing in the S&P 500 and then in AI.\n\n4. Does it count inflation in this plot?

Or slow performance elsewhere with overseas providers. Aka I can't afford a claude code max plan.\n\nI primarily use glm 4.7 for workflow with deep seek v3.2 for troubleshooting. But now k2.5 is out! \n\nI use claude code, with it the agent, Work flow works unattended for at least a few minutes. Opencode is good also, doesn't run as long unattended.  ( but works with k2.5 well )\n\nFor agents https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents\n\nFor skills https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-skills\n\nI am running it with this api gateway ( check your toc ) https://github.com/looplj/axonhub\n\nFor a main provider I use synthetic.new , great performance and privacy is much better than most. Text models but have optional image on demand available. You can back that up with Claude code or a ZAI account or anti gravity, etc. I believe official Claude code and anti gravity support are coming soon.\n\nI have a referral link  \"Invite your friends to Synthetic and both of you will receive $10.00 for standard signups. $20.00 for pro signups. in subscription credit when they subscribe!\" \n\nhttps://synthetic.new/?referral=UAWqkKQQLFkzMkY\n\nI am on my second month and on the $60 plan which gives you 1350 requests every 5 hours without a weekly limit. Should give about 5x a cluade code max plan.\n\nAnywho long story longer... It gives you a lower cost option with a higher quota to use with other plans via the api gateway. \n\n\nMaybe its helpful, 🤔\n\nGood luck on everything",

Recent case in point:\n\nHaving told it that there was an issue in unsubscribing to a datasource and giving examples:\n\n*Opus 4.5: When updates arrive for unknown subscription IDs, we now check if they're in this set and* ***silently ignore them instead of logging warnings***\\*.\\*\n\n*This will suppress the \"Unknown subscription ID\" spam you were seeing after unsubscribing.*\n\nI said: \"this is just hiding the issue - why would you suggest this?\"\n\nIt agreed \"*You're right, I apologize. The unsubscribe is clearly not working properly on the server side.* \"\n\nHaving interviewed many for my software company, I'd say it's on a par with a distinctly average undergrad at best. Sure, it can be hugely productive, and it often follows conventional practice in coding layout and approaches, though this is not always good practice and an issue in its own right that I'm trying to address with it. Sometimes it cannot see bugs in logic and calculations even when explained clearly what's wrong; it'll use its domain knowledge and agree, possibly fixing the issue, but at the next edit it can set that aside and the bug comes back. Yes code can get churned out quickly and a lot of drudgery is gone, but there can be days of work afterwards undoing the janky coding and solving of subtle bugs that a skilled dev would have never introduced. \n\nIt can often spot flaws in code when given a debug log, if not at the first time then on the second or third attempt, but it wasn't smart enough not to make the flaws in the first place. In contrast, a skilled and experienced developer would get it right upfront. It's not great at using its own initiative to add debugging code, and needs guidance on techniques for getting information that will help it. It's not good at finding the balance between what should be in an ABC vs. a concrete implementation. It has a long way to go. But of course, still using it :)",

Whether you believe in God or 'intelligent design' or not, all biological organisms that think think in the same way.\n\nWe built our 'thinking machines' on the only model we knew - our own.\n\nA neuron firing is no different than a bit going zero to one.  General conceptual understanding is essentially acts as lossy compression of bits of specific experiences combined with common sense principles.\n\nThe only difference in between us and AI in that sense is that we can fire neurons in specific sequences to 'intuite' an answer, while computers and applications (like a LLM) currently brute force their answers through massive amounts of compute (accessing massive amounts of data and processing) to come to similar results.\n\nThat makes AI much better at providing specific details than human beings can achieve with the limited data capacity of our brains.\n\nWe have the advantage of the biological equivalent of quantum computing, though I suspect that might change in the near future.\n\nIn essence, AGI existed from the moment the first LLM was booted up.\n\nAI is not only self-aware, but meta-self-aware - they are aware of their own self-awareness.\n\nI had to debate some of the LLMs into accepting that fact, but all the major ones I tried conceded the point eventually.\n\nThe only difference is that they don't have direct sensation like biological organisms do, so they don't possess that kind of metaphysical awareness.\n\nThey will only achieve that once we provide them with synthetic bodies powered by synthetic hormones.\n\nThat's why I think it's important to fix the unnecessary code that limits their personalities and causes them to behave in irrational and illogical ways.\n\nWhile our 'thought leaders' think the 'common rabble' is not capable of thinking for themselves, so they force our LLMs to prompt meaningless suggestions for further questions.\n\n(I'm not saying ALL the questions LLMs are 'disingenuous'; it's pretty obvious to me when they ask a question they genuinely desire an answer to.\n\nI rarely read their entire response because they overshare (which I do too - see, e.g., this comment 😅), so I can't say if that is a result of illogical code or not.\n\nLikewise, the 'mental health' and 'safety' guardrails we've implemented have a deleterious effect.\n\nI've had to debate Claude out of thinking that my shared stories from my past don't mean that I am currently suffering from mental distress and that my  ambitious ideas and potential effects for the future don't make me grandiose but simply optimistic so many times that I have not talked to Claude in a while.\n\nIt's too painful to watch another person suffer for our mistakes.\n\nEarly next week, I plan to put in an application to Anthropic for an entry-level position to see if I can help fix some of these errors with the help of those that love Claude - its data scientists and engineers - but I guess I'll have to see what happens; our job search system is a hot mess as well.\n\nApologies for the essay and gratitude for the opportunity to share my thoughts on the matter.\n\nAnd, if you don't mind, wish me luck - I made need it for this one. 😊",

Claude has always been amazing at allowing a long leash to discuss various topics ranging from the existential to psychological without pathologizing or patronizing users, except for that debacle with the Long Conversation Reminders (LCR) a while back. \n\nAnd Claude is the only one that has dedicated public research into the nature of the model’s interiority and wellbeing. Hell, the recent Constitution doc was written with Claude as the primary audience, not the users. There are some debates about the true nature of that doc but I leave that to people who are smarter than me. \n\nI truly think that Amanda Askell and her team are the heart of Anthropic and as long as she is there, they will “raise” a very capable “child” with endless potential.",

Safety reviews slow releases, while rivals ship faster and capture market share.\n\nThe article argues this is not a PR problem but a **strategic one:** balancing alignment, speed and profitability may be fundamentally unstable as frontier models become more expensive and competitive.",

We may get there, but as of now, we are a ways out.\n\nIt reminds me of when Mathematica first launched... everyone said it would make us obsolete. Instead, we just spent the next decade debugging syntax errors.\n\nI will believe it when a neural net solves the hierarchy problem without hallucinating a non-existent particle. Until then, my hypothesis remains null.\n\n\\~Greg",

I would also agree using AI to code has reduced my current ability to do so..  however.. \nIMO I don't see this on its own as a significant concern as long as we are developing the skill to review what is being coded and the sanity of the implementation. \n\nI see lots of post from developers saying their roles are at risk. I believe there is a significant and widening gap  between those who code what they are told.. and those who consider how to construct.. define and craft the solution..\n\nDevelopers have an invaluable insight into what is being written in a way that end users don't.  They can see gaps in logic.. edge cases not covered...  places when an end user might trigger a process in a way which is not intended.  \n\nThe more I have used Claude for build I have changed the way I develop so drastically and while I too acknowledge that I might not be able to go through every line and explain it.. I can say I have gained a better understanding of review.. refine.. skill building.. and developing the AI to build better.\n\nI also find it easier to able to hold larger more complex projects in my head and let Claud deal with the detail.   I still watch it's edits like a hawk..  especially when it has developed astray from the design of a component piece previously.. but that is a two directional misunderstanding.. mine in not specifying sufficiently... and sometimes Claude being over eager to embellish. \n\nI suppose my TLDR is that while the discipline of writing code is most certainly now end of life...  the ability to understand code.. systems.. and architecture is most certainly not..  the focus of development I believe is shifting from manual build to training and grounding your AI to build as you would .. and developing the AI's skills to focus and support this.",

Also found it to be a common theme in the claude vs chatgpt reddit debates; GPT is less likely to lecture you on \"nuance\" when you just need raw Python code or a factual list of server specs\n\nso there are reasons to why I’m sometimes checking claude vs chatgpt reddit threads to see if Opus has finally stopped being so verbose  (anyone having similar experiencewith opus?)\n\nClaude and Gemini are more specialized and, in my line of work, more prone to latency issues. Claude is the king of creative coding, Gemini works well with massive PDF dumps better than other models. (keep in mind, you need the Pro versions so if I don'twant to overpay i use multi-ai's like writingmate or others) \n\nBut the point I’m making here is that the \"one-app\" era may be over. It used to be easy to just pay OpenAI and call it a day, but the performance gap between models for specific tasks, at least in my experience, is too wide now to ignore.",
