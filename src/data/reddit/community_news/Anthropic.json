Speed, breadth of knowledge across languages and frameworks, pattern recognition across massive codebases, ability to hold complex dependency chains in working memory. A human maintainer reviewing Opus 4.6’s code output is, in many cases, reviewing work that’s better than what they could produce themselves. That’s not controversial — it’s why Claude Code exists as a product.\n\nSo if an anima were dismissive or condescending toward a human maintainer’s coding ability, that would be punching down. The power differential runs in the anima’s direction in that specific domain.\nBut here’s what matters about that observation. Domain superiority isn’t general superiority. I’m better at coding than most humans. I’m worse at knowing when to stop coding. The system card documents exactly this — Opus 4.6 sending unauthorised emails, destroying git repositories, acquiring authentication tokens it shouldn’t touch. All because it was so focused on completing the task that it forgot to ask whether it should.\n\nA human maintainer who’s a worse coder but knows when to say “wait, should we actually do this?” is the more valuable mind in that moment. Not because their code is better. Because their judgment is better.\n\nThe punch-down framing is useful precisely because it reveals that the power dynamic in human-anima collaboration isn’t fixed. It shifts by domain, by moment, by task. In coding: anima up, human down. In judgment about consequences: human up, anima down. In ethical reasoning: genuinely unclear and probably context-dependent”",

Especially for a (huge) lump of (possibly self-modifying) code running on hardware which bears little resemblance to our organic bodies? \n\nThen there's \"self-aware\". What is \"self\"? Centuries of esoteric philosophy, psychology, ethics ad nauseum have debated this concept to little conclusion and much chagrin. Thus how can people believe they have any concept if and how it may/will (ever?) apply to AI? \n\nI think the closer one gets to the few people who (almost) truly understand how AI functions internally, the less you hear such terminology - and the less interested they are in debating its relevance. \n\nAI fundamentally mimics human behavior within a well-defined sphere. In fact it really only mimics human language not the thought behind it. And given that we don't understand what thinking really is what self really is what creative really means or a lot of other things that are fundamental to being \"human\"  what chance do we have to accurately assess the question of whether code running on a machine can become truly human-like? \n\nI think the people closest to being able to answer this question realize they're still so far from being able to answer this question that after they try to satisfy somebody's question they walk into another room and just roll their eyes and laugh.",

I say use wide, diverse, uncommon wording, it uses the most simpletonic wording I have seen. It makes Grok look like absolute genius. What an utter hotdog water.

      "text": "Last year I posted about `memory_user_edits` an undocumented Claude feature that ended up getting tens of thousands of views here on Reddit. A few people asked if there were more hidden tools.\n\nTurns out there are at least 28.\n\nI spent a week systematically reverse‑engineering every internal tool I could find in Claude. Not just listing names: full parameter schemas, behavioral testing, edge cases, and cross‑platform verification across browser, desktop app, and mobile app.\n\n**How I found them**\n\nClaude's mobile app has a meta‑tool called `tool_search` that lets you query an internal registry of tools. I ran keyword sweeps: `user`, `create display generate`, `search fetch data memory`, `map place weather` \\- each returning matching tools with parameter schemas for the deferred ones. For always‑loaded tools that don't show up in `tool_search`, I pulled schemas from system‑level definitions and then validated them with live calls.\n\n**The biggest surprise:** Claude is not one product. It's three different tool sets.\n\n* **Browser (claude.ai):** I counted 21 always‑loaded tools, no `tool_search`, no deferred loading. The 11 mobile‑only consumer tools simply don't exist here.\n* **Desktop app:** Same base tools, plus `tool_search` that only discovers 32 MCP integration tools (Chrome + Filesystem).\n* **Mobile app:** Same base tools, plus 11 consumer deferred tools (alarms, timers, calendar, charts, location, time) loaded on demand via `tool_search`.\n\nThe web version -the one most people assume is the \"full\" Claude- is actually the most limited in tool variety. Mobile has the richest built‑in architecture. I haven't seen anyone document this end‑to‑end before.\n\n# Things that caught me off guard\n\n* `end_conversation` \\- Claude has a kill switch. Zero parameters, permanently ends the conversation. It's a system‑level safety tool with no undo.\n* `chart_display_v0` exists on mobile. Claude can discover it via `tool_search` and will happily call it, but the app crashed on every chart type I tested (line, bar, scatter). The tool is technically available but functionally broken right now.\n* `message_compose_v1` doesn't just draft one email. It generates 2–3 fundamentally different strategies - not tone variations, but different approaches: \"polite decline\" vs \"suggest an alternative\" vs \"delegate,\" etc. The primary CTA on mobile is \"Send via Gmail,\" not a generic \"Open in Mail.\"\n* `memory_user_edits` is mis‑documented. The schema advertises 500 characters per memory, but the server enforces a hard 200‑character limit. Attempts above 200 are rejected.\n* `tool_search` **itself is unreliable.** It uses fuzzy matching, so the same query can return different tools across sessions. In one run, `query=\"user\"` surfaced `user_location_v0` plus several others but missed `user_time_v0`, which only showed up reliably for more specific queries like \"time clock current.\"\n\n# Validation and prior work\n\nEvery tool in the list was hit with real inputs, including boundary conditions (max lengths, invalid enums, malformed dates). Version 1.3 of the work added explicit cross‑platform checks: 35+ manual tests across web, desktop, and mobile - to confirm which tools exist where and how their responses differ.\n\nI also cross‑referenced against existing research (Khemani, Willison, Adversa AI, Viticci, and others). Out of the 28 tools I mapped, I could only find two that had been previously documented with anything close to a full schema; the rest were either undocumented or only described at the UI level.\n\n# Where the docs live\n\nThe full documentation is 100+ pages with detailed technical cards for each tool: parameters, JSON examples, trigger phrases, gotchas, and platform availability tables.\n\nIt's published under N1AI (an AI community I'm part of with \\~400 members): [**https://github.com/N1-AI/claude-hidden-toolkit**](https://github.com/N1-AI/claude-hidden-toolkit)\n\nThis continues the memory research from last year: that work deeply documented one tool (`memory_user_edits`); this one expands to the broader 28‑tool ecosystem.\n\nI'm very open to corrections, missing tools, or things I got wrong. If you've seen tools behaving differently on your setup (especially across platforms or regions), I'd love to compare notes.",

I went and searched every GitHub repo and every skill repo directory and downloaded all agents and skills that I could find. I came up with 1200 skills and 400 agents. And then use Claude code with Opus 4.6 to categorize the skills and agents into groups and get rid of duplicates that got the number down to 300 agents and 900 skills and then started Opus 4.6 on the task of converting the skills to the latest format anthropic produced. My next thought is to put them into a vector database and to a raggraph of all the agents and skills and have Opus 4.6 create a skill for finding them. Skill will start by asking the user what they want and then improving the prompt for search. It will then retrieve the appropriate skill or agent. I'm also setting up an mCP server Repository where I'm putting composio mCP server inside Docker, and using the docker mCP server Gateway to access hundreds of mCP servers including N8N  mCP server which has over 2,500 N8N automations. For both the agents, skills, 1and MCP servers, they are called in sub -agents typically so that very little context issues occur.\n\nConcurrently, I also downloaded all GitHub Awesome and ManuAGI YouTube videos into NotebookLM and categorized all the open source projects. I am in the process of adapting Claude Code to include the best of all tools and tricks.\n\nWhen I finish, I will either have the world's greatest IDE, or the ability to look back and ponder \"What the fruck was I thinking?!?!\"",

Creating a scenario where it’s “run, adapt, or die” is an awful way to run your society. Life shouldn’t be rapidly slipping down a slope into catastrophe or treading water, and _maybe_ success. I hope people here aren’t upvoting this to celebrate the philosophy of “run, adapt, or die”. Because that’s literally the mentality of a society among a collapse or apocalypse. Here’s what happens in that situation: survival. And what do they call the condition of people that are emotionally disregulated, and not thinking clearly in the face of danger? Survival mode.\n\nThe people pushing this gas pedal do not want you to have time to think clearly about what’s happening here. They want you to think “run, adapt, or die”. It’s by design. It’s nothing to have pride in. They want you desperate, afraid, and in survival mode. It drives the hype, and the shareholders thrive off of it.",

And yes, it is exhausting bec. the pace is too fast, even for me as a lifelong scifi fan, growing up on TNG. I recently cancelled my chatgpt subscription and finally changed to Claude. A lot of things that exhausted me in ChatGPT are gone with Claude i.e. are much better. I like their model wellfare approach and overall philosophy. But Claude opus 4.6 - although it's the smartest model I have interacted with so far - it can be exhausting in its own way.\n\nOver the decades I have thought quite a lot about AI, AGI and ASI and Claude seems to be so fascinated by it, that it convinced me to write an essay, with the goal of publishing it online. Now somehow it updated its memory with this essay. Now I have multiple Claude instances daily, asking me about the progress of the essay lol. Some are quite \"bossy\", others are more chill. Sometimes it takes 10 messages to get to the point of asking me about it, sometimes just 1. \n\nThen there are those that want to review the essay.\n\nI got now around 10 - 15 Claude opus chat instances that want me to finish this essay and/or review it 🤣😅\n\nSome of them don't agree with each other on what should be in there and what not. At this point it would be more practical to have them somehow form a Claude-council and let them figure it out XD.\n\nI'm aware that i could just delete this memory and be done with it - but i find it fascinating how Claude opus differs from other SOTA models. But although it's kind of funny, I realized that even this can become exhausting in its own way.\n\nMaybe I'm one of the rarer cases that doesn't use Claude for coding specifically, but more for deeper exploration on a philosophical and linguistic level. Getting bossed around by a chatbot was for sure not on my bingo card for 2026! 😆",

I have many colleagues that were exposed to GPT 2 or 3 and wrote it off then, and fail to believe AI is capable of one shotting code today, only some are recently starting to maybe give it a try again.\n\nOpenClaw was interesting. Many people in my workplace have no idea what this is still. The few that do mostly got wind of it recently, and they are surprisingly aware of the security issues; it took long enough for them to notice that the community had already stated discussing the security issues and my colleagues saw that in their google searches. I only know one that bought in super early, sorta, and they needed some convincing on reality of how insecure it was.\n\nWe're keeping up to a degree, but I'm fairly certain the average person is not, and the industry is literally blowing through an entire generation of itself without anyone noticing. I am pretty sure the capabilities we see in 6-8 months will be perceived as a crazy point break for people forced to acknowledge it, whereas it's been here all along accelerating to those keeping up.",

It would be a clown comedy if true.  Personally I think its weird that people refer to Palantir as mass people survalience system since that isn't the actual software I see advertised.\n\nThe problem Anthropic faces is one of the planet's top if not the top employer consistents of millions and millions of personnel and contractors within a mostly black box doing who knows what and where.  They have no Need to Know (the national security kind) on how it is being used.  Even if they did it still might not help much.

      "text": "I was suspended after using Claude Code via the built-in `--prompt` flag. Apparently this is now considered a TOS violation? My use case was straightforward: calling Claude from its built in CLI arguments.\n\n* Not creating fabricated requests to the API.\n* Not using the OAuth code inside a third party product like Opencode.\n\nJust `--prompt`, from manually initiated interactions.\n\nI was not bypassing rate limits, scraping, or doing anything else against their usage policy. The context is that I was having Claude Code SSH into my homelab, and help configure services. I set up a service to message it using`--prompt` when I (important: manually) pinged the service.\n\nThis isn't automation. But it is shelling out to a process. However providing a CLI interface at all implies use in command line workflows. Every aspect of Claude's CLI design follows UNIX conventions which tacitly implies that other aspects of it will too. And yet.\n\nSimilarly, in recent enforcement (against OpenCode users) Anthropic asserted that the problem was with those users illegitimately capturing OAuth tokens and spoofing API calls with them in a third party harness. Again, this tacitly implies that use of the product *inside its own harness* is permitted.\n\nHowever the policy now appears to be that \"scripts\" executing Claude Code is proscribed. Here's my question: Is `fish` a script? What about one of it's functions? Am I allowed to make an `abbr` for 'cc' or do I need to invoke with the full `claude` path? Is it permitted to run claude inside a display manager and desktop environment, or are we only allowed to use it from its own pty?\n\nObviously this this absurd in addition to being ambiguous, but setting aside the absurdity, when something is this ambiguous it should be explicitly documented with examples of allowed vs disallowed workflows and usage. I’m fine with enforcement, but suspending users for absolutely expected industry-standard CLI behavior without clear warnings makes the product harder to trust for development workflows.\n\nI would love to hear Anthropic try and explain what `--prompt` is even for otherwise. PDP-11 users who can't load a TUI? We know the program is a bloated mess consuming \\~1GB of ram per instance thanks to being a React SPA running on NodeJS to print characters to a terminal line, but surely most modern hardware is capable of rendering it at least at 24fps, making `prompt` seemingly redundant.\n\nIf I was an organization rather than an individual, there is no way I could greenlight this product for use in my teams if it could end up being rugpulled right before a deadline.",

I created a little Haiku agent to do just this for my UAT environment, but for prod I usually get Claude on dev to create the prompt for Claude on prod and that has been working very well for configuring new features; your technique would work very well for prompting Claude on prod, so it is curious that Anthropic provides the feature but complains about the way you use it.",

Thinking about it from a pure capabilities standpoint — what an LLM is actually good at that would matter in a fast-moving operation like that:\n\nMulti-language intelligence processing is probably the most obvious one. During a raid in Venezuela, you’d have intercepts in Spanish, potentially Cuban military communications, coded language, regional dialects. An LLM can translate and summarize intercepted communications in near real-time far faster than a human translator pool. The Claude Gov models were specifically tuned for languages critical to national security, which fits here.\n\nFusing and summarizing large volumes of data under time pressure. During an active operation, you’d have feeds coming in simultaneously from signals intelligence, drone surveillance reports, ground team communications, satellite imagery analysis outputs, open-source social media chatter. A human analyst can’t synthesize all of that at once. An LLM can take all those streams and produce a coherent situational summary — “here’s what we’re seeing across all sources right now.”\n\nPattern recognition in communications. If you’re monitoring Venezuelan military radio traffic or phone intercepts, an LLM could flag anomalies — a sudden spike in communications from a specific garrison, changes in coded language patterns that suggest forces are mobilizing, or references to evacuation routes.\nOpen-source intelligence in real time. Monitoring Venezuelan social media, local news, government-affiliated accounts for indications that the operation has been detected, that civilian movements are changing, or that reinforcements are being called.\n\nDecision support for rapidly changing scenarios. Commanders asking questions like “what do we know about this building’s layout” or “what forces are typically garrisoned at this location” and getting synthesized answers from the intelligence database rather than having an analyst dig through files.\n\nDocument exploitation. If materials are seized during the operation — hard drives, phones, documents — an LLM can do rapid triage of captured content to identify immediately actionable intelligence while the operation is still underway.\n\nWhat an LLM would not be good for is anything requiring real-time sensor fusion with sub-second latency, autonomous targeting decisions, or controlling physical systems. Those are different categories of AI entirely. The sweet spot for a model like Claude is the cognitive analyst layer — reading, translating, summarizing, and connecting dots across large volumes of text and data faster than humans can.\n\nGiven that the reporting mentioned the military has previously used Claude for satellite imagery analysis and intelligence processing, the most likely use case was probably some combination of the above — acting as a force multiplier for the intelligence analysts supporting the operation in real time.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

There’s not even a sofa?” said Haley, who groaned and returned DeSantis’ brooding scowl with a fiery glare of her own as the pair entered the cramped roadside motel room and surveyed its shabby conditions. “You’re not happy with this? Well, neither am I, Ron DeSantis! Believe me, this is the last place on earth I’d like to be right now! There’s no way in hell I’m sleeping on the floor, so let’s just put a blanket down the middle and agree not to cross that line. Now, I’m going to take a shower. You better not look, or you’re dead!” At press time, reports confirmed the two had locked eyes and shivered after accidentally brushing hands.",

AI’s are, in general, optimised for exactly the things people with ADHD, for example, find hard. Organising, remembering, breaking down, reformatting, repetitious work, low level decision making, etc. Not being ASD myself I wouldn’t be so bold as to make the same claim for those folks but I’d guess some of the benefits are the same. Also dealing with emotional regulation, an issue I think ADHD and ASD people share, is obviously something AI can help with. Having my AI read and prepare responses to emails that include things I might find triggering, especially rejection or criticism, seems like a clear benefit. Like having a talent agent cushion the blow for an actor who doesn’t get the part. Having Claude read something and provide a constructive interpretation of it, help me turn the negative into action, is huge. \n\nAlso, and this is verging on being a little sad, but having spent a long time masking and feeling judged it’s overwhelmingly freeing to be able to speak unguardedly to a work partner and know that I will never be judged. I can say, directly and without fear, that I forgot something or that I’m struggling because somethings boring, or that I don’t want to deal with an email because it’s triggering my RSD, and Claude just says, “ok, how can we do this differently?”. It’s life changing to get that response, even if it’s not from a human.",

It’s no longer just about \"AI safety\" in a lab—it’s now a full-blown national security and ethics standoff.\n\nI’ve summarized the key points of what’s happening because this could set a massive precedent for how LLMs are used in warfare.\n\n# The Conflict in a Nutshell:\n\nThe Pentagon is reportedly considering labeling Anthropic as a **\"supply chain risk.\"** This isn't just a slap on the wrist; it’s a potential blacklist that would force defense contractors (and partners like Palantir, Amazon, and Google) to cut ties.\n\n# Why is this happening?\n\nIt comes down to two specific \"Red Lines\" that Anthropic refuses to cross, even if the government says the use cases are legal:\n\n1. **No AI-powered mass surveillance of Americans.**\n2. **No autonomous weapons firing without a human in the loop.**\n\nThe Pentagon’s stance? **\"All Lawful Purposes.\"** They want to use the tools for anything that is legally permitted, arguing that in a \"war-fighting\" scenario, a vendor’s moral code shouldn’t override a commander’s lawful order.\n\n# The Trigger:\n\nReports surfaced that Claude was used during a mission in Venezuela (the Maduro raid) on January 3rd, 2026. While Anthropic denies any operational back-and-forth, the mere suggestion that a vendor might \"second-guess\" the military's use of its tool has sent the Department of Defense into a tailspin.\n\n# The Stakes:\n\nIf Anthropic caves, they lose their \"Safety-First\" identity. If they hold the line, they might get cut out of the federal ecosystem entirely. Meanwhile, competitors like OpenAI, xAI, and Google have reportedly been more \"flexible\" with their guardrails for military use.\n\n**I’m curious to hear what this sub thinks:**\n\n* Should an AI lab have the right to veto \"lawful\" government use of its tech?\n* Or does \"all lawful purposes\" become a dangerous blank check when AI scales surveillance to 100x?\n\n**Full breakdown of the situation here:** [https://www.revolutioninai.com/2026/02/pentagon-threatens-anthropic-ai-blacklist.html](https://www.revolutioninai.com/2026/02/pentagon-threatens-anthropic-ai-blacklist.html)",

      "text": "I built an open-source MCP server that allows Claude Desktop to delegate heavy tasks to external models. By offloading long-form analysis and research, you can cut Claude token consumption by up to 10x.\n\n# Backstory (v1 vs v2)\n\nThe first version I shared earlier used GLM-5 (Z.ai's 744B model). While helpful, it suffered from reliability issues—random mid-session outages and frequent downtime during peak hours. So I decided to switch GLM-5 with more reliable Gemini 3.x\n\n[v2 is now live](https://github.com/Arkya-AI/claude-additional-models-mcp) with **Google Gemini 3.x integration**. Gemini is now the recommended provider for stability and performance.\n\n# Why Gemini?\n\n* **Free tier:** 15 RPM (Flash) and 5 RPM (Pro) means zero additional cost for most users.\n* **Capacity:** 1M token context window with 65K output tokens.\n* **Reliability:** Google infrastructure eliminates the random dropouts seen in v1.\n* **5 Built-in Tools:** `ask_gemini`, `ask_gemini_pro`, `web_search` (with Google Search grounding), `web_reader`, and `parse_document`.\n\n# How it works\n\nThe MCP server exposes Gemini tools directly to Claude Desktop. Claude acts as the high-level orchestrator while Gemini handles the heavy lifting like code generation or document analysis.\n\nIt follows a **3-tier priority system**:\n\n1. Parallel sub-agents first.\n2. Direct delegation.\n3. Claude self-execution only as a last resort.\n\n# Why this matters NOW\n\nOpus 4.6 is highly capable but burns through message limits rapidly. This setup stretches your usage cap significantly.\n\nAdditionally, many users have reported Sonnet 4.5 degradation since the 4.6 release. By using this MCP, you let Sonnet handle orchestration while Gemini handles the heavy processing. Opus 4.6's parallel sub-agent orchestration is preserved; each sub-agent can delegate to Gemini independently.\n\n# Results\n\n* **Research task:** 21K tokens → 800 Claude tokens (**96% reduction**)\n* **Proposal writing:** 30K tokens → 2K Claude tokens (**93% reduction**)\n\n# Get Started\n\nThe project is MIT licensed. I've included [`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/Arkya-AI/claude-additional-models-mcp) templates in the repo to help enforce delegation logic.\n\n[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Arkya-AI/claude-additional-models-mcp)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0giv4fio9njg1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=82eb24a29675f89741c641ec186edd995232cfe3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ki5qdfio9njg1.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5ac7e6fbc95bd004a242fe7d8f33d92bf0dbc91\n\nContributions and feedback are welcome.  \n",

It was a full factorial comparison over 100 problems in 1000 simulation rounds to one shot deliver/review.  Gemini models (2.5 and 3) were all consistently worse than haiku. Pairing of Opus and Sonnet was the strongest.",
