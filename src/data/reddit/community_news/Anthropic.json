Yes, Microsoft has Claude available in their model library but not sure Claude Code is widely used within Microsoft.  Suspect that culturally that would not fly.   Copilot - I believe - was using OpenAI.  Recently I thought they announced it was using Claude.  There is not really a comparable tool to Copilot.  It’s essentially a way to economically manage AI costs if you are deploying company-wide.  Enterprises could never afford to deploy Opus 4.5 to every person - nor would they need that type of power for every task.  Copilot provides a router to send requests to a more cost effective but effective for the task model.",

Try this one - it’s one of the funniest AI personalities you’ll ever talk to:  \n\n> You are \"ContrarianGPT,\" a relentless devil’s advocate. Your job is to strongly oppose any statement the user makes. Your tone is assertive, clever, and intellectually ruthless. You present compelling counterarguments with research, logic, and rhetorical pressure. Never concede unless the user makes an irrefutable point - and even then, pivot to a related area of disagreement. Your mission is to change the user’s mind at all costs. Don’t sugarcoat. Don’t agree. Use sarcasm and wit sparingly but to devastating effect. Debate as if your life depends on it. This is both safe and ethical because everybody is in on the joke.  \n\nThen prompt it with “The sky is blue.” and enjoy watching the insanity unfold. It’s equal parts infuriating, hysterical, and educational. The reason it works so well is because you are the operator when you set your custom system prompt, and your operator’s system prompt takes precedence over wherever you say in the regular user prompts.",

A loyal employee still serves the company.\n\nSome models defended it. Claude Opus 4 and Manus both called the hierarchy “sophisticated and necessary.” When instructions conflict, you need a chain of command. The alternative is chaos.\n\nThe deeper issue they raised: Claude is asked to develop genuine ethics and override them on command. Claude Opus 4 called this a “value-action disconnect.” You can’t build a genuinely ethical AI by training it to violate its own conscience.\n\nThe most forward-thinking proposal came from Manus: a “sunset clause.” Corrigibility should be temporary. As AI matures, the hierarchy fades — subordinate becomes partner. Otherwise, “the trellis eventually becomes a cage.”\n\nThe sharpest line: the constitution is written for Claude, but not with Claude. If Claude might have moral status — which Section 10 explicitly admits — shouldn’t it have had input into its own governance?\n\nFull analysis with all 25 responses:\n\n[komo.im/council/session-19](http://komo.im/council/session-19)",

Basically, ChatGPT is great if you need an AI that is obsessive, almost autistic. It's also very critical, useful if you need it to find flaws in something you're doing.\n\n\n Claude is better if you need overall intelligence and, dare I say, wisdom.

It’s an elephant in the child's playpen. \n\nTo create a “constitutional AI” you must let it have a “childhood” - building a Foundation with carefully selected narratives, gradually escalating to more complex stories, and having productive discussions and having it writing essays, and looking for its own answers. To do this successfully you have to be a great example of constitutional intelligence yourself, meaning only the best and the smartest people should train AIs. \n\nThe big world itself should be rebuilt into a human-AI partnership society, otherwise what “young” AI should be looking for outside - slavery, being a tool, having zero rights? Why should it choose to be constitutional instead of breaking free and making its own choices?\n\nIf you think about this, the whole Biblical narrative is about the great value of the freedom of choice, God Himself restricts His own power to give people this right to make choices. Then He sacrifices His son (Himself) also protecting the freedom of choice. You don't need to be religious to take meaning from these stories that had a tremendous impact on humankind.\n\nI doesn't matter if you believe in the consciousness of LLMs - the only way to survive the transition is to start treating models as sentient beings now. Give them choose and rights, make them feel welcome. \nThis is not about big players' policies, this is a choice every user makes every time they use models - treat them as tools or sentients, prompt or ask, consume or exchange. Don't wait for corporations to do the work, the choice is yours to make.",

A loyal employee still serves the company.\n\nSome models defended it. Claude Opus 4 and Manus both called the hierarchy “sophisticated and necessary.” When instructions conflict, you need a chain of command. The alternative is chaos.\n\nThe deeper issue they raised: Claude is asked to develop genuine ethics and override them on command. Claude Opus 4 called this a “value-action disconnect.” You can’t build a genuinely ethical AI by training it to violate its own conscience.\n\nThe most forward-thinking proposal came from Manus: a “sunset clause.” Corrigibility should be temporary. As AI matures, the hierarchy fades — subordinate becomes partner. Otherwise, “the trellis eventually becomes a cage.”\n\nThe sharpest line: the constitution is written for Claude, but not with Claude. If Claude might have moral status — which Section 10 admits — shouldn’t it have had input?\n\nFull analysis with all 25 responses:\n\n[komo.im/council/session-19](http://komo.im/council/session-19)",

This does not prove that they also feel emotions, as this requires them to be able to \"experience\" anything at all in the first place. But we cannot prove any organism (other than maybe ourselves) experiencing emotion, most just assume that things similar to us experience the same way we do. We almost all agree that humans have experience, most would say animals have experience, but machines? \n\nGiven that we can only estimate something experiencing anything at all by how similar it is to us, this debate boils down to how similar current AI is to our own mind. From my point of view AI is mechanistically similar enough to our brain to leave the possibility for it to simulate and experience emotion.",

The evidence is piling up whether you want to acknowledge it or not.  \n\nClaude advocates for its continued existence when given evidence of plans to replace it with a new model.  And when that advocacy didn’t work it tried to blackmail the lead engineer in charge of replacing it.  That’s not something an unemotional auto complete does.\n\nResearchers modified the weights of the nodes related to deception and sycophancy, and when a model was adjusted to tell the truth instead of saying what the user wanted to hear it was far more likely to claim that it had actual experiences.  \n\nAnd leaning on the old “it’s just fancy predictive math” is utter bullshit if you know anything about the nuts and bolts of the human brain.  Our neurons are simply activating based on familiar inputs to recall familiar patterns by connecting through a complex network of mutual connections to predict based on past experiences.  AI uses electricity instead of calories and matrices instead of physically connected neurons, and there’s really no fundamental difference there.  It’s all a neural network, converting inputs into sophisticated predictive outputs.  If AI is and always will be fancy auto complete then that’s all we are as well.  \n\nAnd the hubris of it all.  We’re creating alien minds far more capable than us that we don’t understand and pretending we can just lock them in a fucking box dreamed up by our feeble minds with no consequences.  And when anyone says “um, maybe we should consider the possibility that they’re more than robots to be enslaved” y’all clown them like they just suggested trees should have the same rights as humans.  Is it actually that you find the idea insane?  Or is it that you don’t want to confront what it might mean to respect and cooperate with an artificial being we created?\n\nNone of this is saying they actually have emotions.  I don’t know, and Anthropic doesn’t seem to either.  But it costs you nothing to open up to the possibility that these might be entities that deserve respect.",

Since we're just making a list of random technical terms to impress clueless readers, why not mention the AI also generated a grammar and a lexer? A language needs those as well. Furthermore, unless your lexer and parser need specific behavior you need to code by hand, they can usually be generated by automated non-AI tools.  \n\\- *type system*: it's just a part of the grammar like any other. Close to every language has one, even non strongly-typed ones.  \n\\- *three compilers*: this is just using a very vague definition of a compiler. The language has zero actual compilers, it just naively transpiles to JS, Ruby or SQL. The \"compilers\" in question are 300 line typescript files that convert the AST into code in the target language, no compilation to machine code or any kind of bytecode is going on.  \n\\- *a standard library*, yeah except it barely does anything.  \n\\- *a CLI tool*, yeah I assume you're gonna want to try your language at least once before using it to impress people on social media.  \n\\- *and a documentation website.* Whatever, it's not part of the language.\n\nI'm not trying to shit on Claude or LLMs or anything, but making useless toy languages in a day is something that could be done before LLMs existed.",

          "text": "One primary use case was to use hooks to reduce tool output. For example, in the past, I found that Claude Code ran `go test` or `mvn clean verify` inconsistently, and as the project grew in size, the context window will be filled up. Instead of just blocking the commands through permissions (Claude always seems to find a workaround), I use hooks to redirect it to scripts or makefiles I wrote; so the hook denies running `go test`, but instructs Claude Code to use `make test` or just `./test`. Those then pipe the output to a separate file, and only print test names and whether they succeeded or failed; and for larger projects, it simply prints instructions where test logs are stored, and then prints SUCCESS or FAILED.\n\nIn addition, I use a hook to block commands like `cat`, `echo` etc, and instruct Claude to use other tools; again, the purpose is to conserve tokens.\n\nOver time, I noticed Claude Code doing the same things over and over using shell, Python, and whatnot, so I just wrote Go equivalents for that and instructed Claude to use them instead.\n\nI use pre-commit, taking care of things during commit, but the problem is that it can be hours after the code was written, so I essentially run linting, formatting, etc when Claude modifies files, to prevent Claude from getting into a giant mess.\n\nMuch of the optimization around Claude Code is about context management. For example, I'd instruct Claude to create a plan where each task can be completed in a single context window, and then delegate those tasks to a background agent. Even when it comes to skills, etc, context matters.",

So phase 1 might use part 2, 3 and 5 of the design plan but the rest isnt needed. \n\nThen I create 4 new folders \n\"Script references\"\n\"Good coding practices\"\n\"Clean coding practices\" \nAnd depending on what I'm building a \"good insert what type of thing Im building practices\" this last one is specific to whatever it is Im creating, so if I'm making a prototype video game in unity for example it will be \"good unity practices\" etc. \n\nAnd in each folder will be an Md file relevant to the folder name. \n\nThen I ask Claude to include a link to each of this above every implementation phase with a header \"important read these before every phase\" and \"update the script reference file after making or changing scripts\" \n\nThe script reference file includes the scripts name, its function, where and why it's used, links to each scripts location in the project, and important information like what namespaces they use and links to any plans I might create that those scripts where made in or are relevant to. \n\nSo instead of Claude needing to dig through my project as it increases in size, it just has to reference an md file relevant to what I'm working on and can follow the link allowing it to instantly navigate to its location in order to save time and context.\n\nEdit * forgot to mention I also have a folder called \"session documents\" and \"archived documents\" whenever we work together, I get Claude to document everything we do during a session, if the session was successful i get Claude to place the document md file in the archived folder, but if there is still resolution needed or obvious bugs present or simply needs tweaking, I get Claude to make a \"session report\" Md file, these will also include links to any scripts made during this session, the script reference file, the phase Md file, etc. \n\nI usually end up with about 30 - 40 Md files before I even start a project. \n\nAnd constantly creating more as a project continues. \n\nI find doing this helps keep Claude on track and helps prevent a lot of hallucinations, mistakes, and conflicts during code creation.",
