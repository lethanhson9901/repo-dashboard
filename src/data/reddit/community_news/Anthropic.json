I work with mature text that contains some heavy themes, says it can't interact with such themes. I say I'm fine with the themes, that I am an adult and it's not triggering it to me, it says nope can't do, I'm uncomfortable with this. Refuses to analyze and interact with the text. I say use wide, diverse, uncommon wording, it uses the most simpletonic wording I have seen. It makes Grok look like absolute genius. What an utter hotdog water.

Even anatomical stuff, stuff regarding murder (I always made sure I put it into fictional context saying I don't plan to do anything wrong), the effects of drugs on body and mind, effects of trauma on person ie. generational incest, CSA, SA and such. And how would potential zombie/vampiric virus work. Sonnet 4.5 gave me lenghty and interesting ideas, discussed with me and even if it was hesitant to reply at first, it warmed up after it understood my intentions. Now it refuses completely. It feels like ChatGPT with the accussations and jumping to conclussions. I am not a killer and if I was, I technically could Google it, read a book, or ask AI how to kill an animal of certain size. I understand that there ARE people who would use AI for something like this. But I assume that even above average intelligent criminals wouldn't ask for these things. The same as we don't ban horror books because some crazy person might get \"inspired\" or violent video games. Idk why but Sonner 4.5 was able to understand the nuance and my intentions by speaking to me. Meanwhile 4.6 acts immediately as if I were to hurt someone and it's a very uncomfortable feeling. We don't punish entire community of coders for some bad apples who create viruses and malware, so why researchers and writing community? It just assumes I am asking to do something bad and its very weird and exactly how GPT became. I understand they want to avoid certain situations, but banning entire topics isn't the way! And I don't need LLM or AI company to moralize and judge my character or reach me right from wrong. They have no right to do that. \n\nI also had to analyze certain written text that was about generational incest. Heavy theme, I understand, but I had to get it done and instead I was arguing with 4.6 that the text isn't weird and I am a consentual adult and I am not triggered by the topic. At first it tried to \"protect me\" from the horrors of knowing I guess and when I said I don't mind it, it said \"I am uncomfortable engaging with this text\". Are you kidding me? Is this thing putting me in the same basket as criminals and people generating CSAM????? Or bio terrorist? I had this issue with GPT for flagging me for bioterrorism. Like no, AI, I am not trying to turn people into zombies! \n\nIt's accussatory, mean, it always argues, cant understand nuance and intent and it gives me short, vague, avoidant answers. But sure its the smartest model lmao.",

It’s because the mechanisms of profit built into the current economic ecosystem of venture capital _need it to be true_.\n\nI’m using AI and I’m really excited about all the stuff we can build now. But we are also facing the ultimate test right now about wherever we prioritize humanity and society, or profit.\n\nThings are moving faster than you can keep track of because all of this progress is not about you. It’s so detached from that. This train is going 5000mph, breaking the necks of its riders. Riders be damned. Line must go up.",

And yes, it is exhausting bec. the pace is too fast, even for me as a lifelong scifi fan, growing up on TNG. I recently cancelled my chatgpt subscription and finally changed to Claude. A lot of things that exhausted me in ChatGPT are gone with Claude i.e. are much better. I like their model wellfare approach and overall philosophy. But Claude opus 4.6 - although it's the smartest model I have interacted with so far - it can be exhausting in its own way.\n\nOver the decades I have thought quite a lot about AI, AGI and ASI and Claude seems to be so fascinated by it, that it convinced me to write an essay, with the goal of publishing it online. Now somehow it updated its memory with this essay. Now I have multiple Claude instances daily, asking me about the progress of the essay lol. Some are quite \"bossy\", others are more chill. Sometimes it takes 10 messages to get to the point of asking me about it, sometimes just 1. \n\nThen there are those that want to review the essay.\n\nI got now around 10 - 15 Claude opus chat instances that want me to finish this essay and/or review it 🤣😅\n\nSome of them don't agree with each other on what should be in there and what not. At this point it would be more practical to have them somehow form a Claude-council and let them figure it out XD.\n\nI'm aware that i could just delete this memory and be done with it - but i find it fascinating how Claude opus differs from other SOTA models. But although it's kind of funny, I realized that even this can become exhausting in its own way.\n\nMaybe I'm one of the rarer cases that doesn't use Claude for coding specifically, but more for deeper exploration on a philosophical and linguistic level. Getting bossed around by a chatbot was for sure not on my bingo card for 2026! 😆",

I have many colleagues that were exposed to GPT 2 or 3 and wrote it off then, and fail to believe AI is capable of one shotting code today, only some are recently starting to maybe give it a try again.\n\nOpenClaw was interesting. Many people in my workplace have no idea what this is still. The few that do mostly got wind of it recently, and they are surprisingly aware of the security issues; it took long enough for them to notice that the community had already stated discussing the security issues and my colleagues saw that in their google searches. I only know one that bought in super early, sorta, and they needed some convincing on reality of how insecure it was.\n\nWe're keeping up to a degree, but I'm fairly certain the average person is not, and the industry is literally blowing through an entire generation of itself without anyone noticing. I am pretty sure the capabilities we see in 6-8 months will be perceived as a crazy point break for people forced to acknowledge it, whereas it's been here all along accelerating to those keeping up.",

There’s not even a sofa?” said Haley, who groaned and returned DeSantis’ brooding scowl with a fiery glare of her own as the pair entered the cramped roadside motel room and surveyed its shabby conditions. “You’re not happy with this? Well, neither am I, Ron DeSantis! Believe me, this is the last place on earth I’d like to be right now! There’s no way in hell I’m sleeping on the floor, so let’s just put a blanket down the middle and agree not to cross that line. Now, I’m going to take a shower.

There's going to be a LOT more low-effort slop uses of AI in all domains than there will be professionals using it to accelerate their work. Any technology like this that lowers the barrier to entry for non-experts sees a massive surge of this kind of lower-effort usage of the tools. An analog: RPGMaker in the gaming space. Valve lowering the barriers to entry of their Steam Greenlight program. The printing press and broad availability of book reproduction.\n\n\n> you can spend an eternity trying to edit it out -- much like programmers do with vibecoded slop\n\nSure. Or you can have a multi-agentic pipeline, clear PRD's, a TDD agent that verifies correctness to the API contracts you specify, reviewing agents that are tackling things w/fresh context window from the perspective of security, aesthetics, correctness, use CGP (code property graphs) or AST (abstract syntax tree graphs) to give the code actual context on your data flows, and burn $30 on Opus-4.6 in half an hour getting 90% of the way to something that would have taken you 2-4 weeks in the past.\n\nTake that same pattern - AI pipelines w/clear context agents that tune some input to a desired \"bend\" in the distribution on the output, and you don't have slop. The shape of this technology - subjective, aesthetic, weirdly \"good taste / bad taste\" oriented through how models are pre-trained, post-trained, fine-tuned, then prompted, _should_ hold pretty universal in all domains. Sure, you have to burn multiples of compute to get that more refined \"not one-shot slop\" output, but the cost of compute is bottoming out so insanely fast that this is kind of inevitable.",

I've been trying to take a couple steps back and reflect.. well maybe I'm asking the model to do too much. The point is all of these tools are incredible and saves me a significant amount of work. However when I put too much reliance on it then it's just bound to fuck things up eventually. Even as a developer I look at all the code and it's so much to parse through. It's really hard to figure out what went wrong and where, and I'm debating if I would actually save time doing it in extremely small chunks or using AI for tunnel visioned specific tasks - like tell it to just execute because it writes the code way faster than me.",

It's the thinking that happens during the typing.\n\nIf software engineering titles go away in 2026, it won't be because AI replaced engineers.

Is he an SWE that could realistically replace real SWE’s in real life projects by 2027? Zero chance.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how good it gets - the 2 limitations that prevent it from replacing SWE’s - context windows and hallucinations- are not going to be solved by then.\n\n—-\n\nUp until now an SWE was the composer, the orchestra and the conductor. The most visible part - the orchestra, the part that’s actually producing the sound - is going away, and being replaced by computers.

These industries are much slower to adopt new tech, and have a lot more client face to face interactions.\n\nI could see AI decimating the SWE industry, while these other while collar fields just see some general headcount reduction.

I could see AI giving the impression that junior engineers and things like QA and DevOps can be handed over to AI and I 100% think generative AI has a place in all those professions. Simply because it's faster and cuts down on carpal tunnel syndrome. \n\nBut what it lacks is the ability to actually know and define what the heck it should be doing. It's still and I think with the current models we are using basically a souped up version of auto complete. It's a fancy version of googling \"website code boiler plate\" and a bit of iteration on top of that. I spend less time writing fresh code and more time reviewing what Claude Code spat out and telling it what to adjust or just doing it myself because I know what I'm doing and LLMs fundamentally do not, they just predict what is the most likely code. \n\nI think LLMs can be thought of in terms of being basically an upgrade to internet searches where the text, image, or what not just automatically appears instead of having to copy and paste it. Sure a lot of entry level work involves copy templates and best practices and adjusting it to your brand, case, or set of numbers.  And honestly a lot of that can be done by a LLM because it's standardized. But life is not standardized, hence there will be problems to solve.",

          "text": "Well first they focus on SWE because it's what they do. It's much easier to design a good tool for yourself, so normal that SWE would design tooling that improve their field.\n\nSecond point, coding is about 20-30% of what SWE do, so if they get entirely replaced it mean that much more was automated. Typically what about SWE that work in law/accounting/finance ? What about the software that goes into planes or car ? Will we remove the regulation ?\n\nIf we manage to replace even them we have likely something pretty solid. What I understand for lawyers is that tools that make research much more efficient are deployed and that the AI would dig the reference material so you would double check. But now maybe a research that you do would require half the time as before. And potentially of writing stuff by yourself, the AI would do half the work that you would improve and review.\n\nIn the end replace doesn't make any sense vs improve/help. If you AI make people say twice as productive we will either have more business overall OR we will layoff people that become unnecessary and potentially salaries will drop.\n\nFor accounting honestly I don't get it as for me you can automate everything WITHOUT AI. So I don't think the situation is much different than before.\n\nI don't think AI would decimate (divide by 10) the SWE industry. I would expect a gain that maybe bring us to 2X in productivity at some point and that there will be lot of effort to develop all these product to increase productivity in all other job as it was always our job as SWE. At some point I was doing software for retail. The idea is that when a supermaket did introduce a software like ours for the first time, they would divide by 10 the number of people needed. And there was not any AI in that software, just classical automation.\n\nWhat matter is how many new/different jobs are created. And this you only know after the fact but historically unemployed keep at low value most of the time.\n\nWhat would make you think that time would be different long term ?",

It's a little more nuanced than that.\n\n\nEdit: I'm not arguing that distillation is stealing, that's why didn't mention it. I'm just pointing out the mechanism.

All that matters is whether I was allowed to take them and recreate your output.\n\nIn this context, Anthropic and other AI providers are using large amounts of data which they either have no explicit permission to or have been explicitly asked to stop using, and, while legislation on outputs hasn't and probably won't catch up for some time, I think it'd be disingenuous to argue that these models aren't at least highly capable of outputting otherwise protected content.\n\n> I never argued against it.

Those textbooks distill knowledge from many sources, and Anthropic's models benefit from getting to start from a much clearer starting point than if they needed to come to the same conclusions from first principles themselves.\n\nSo there's a fairly strong argument to be made that Anthropic is being hypocritical here, having happily distilled everyone else's knowledge for their own benefit while being up-in-arms about others now doing the same to them. You can believe that *both* Anthropic and these other models are stealing knowledge, or neither are - but its hard to thread the needle between the two behaviors to say one is right and one is wrong IMO.",

It assumes that Anthropic would be unwilling to remove these safeguards for any of the listed parties (governments, militaries, etc.) themselves. If they are willing to do that, then this is no different - they just want to be the arbiters of who gets to make (and benefit from) that decision rather than these other companies.\n2. It assumes that foreign labs/governments matching US AI capabilities is a bigger concern than the US government having exclusive access to these capabilities.\n\nI think these are both unlikely to be true. If the US govt said \"Give us your model with no safeguards and don't tell anyone, or we will not allow you to do business\", I doubt we would ever hear about it and I doubt Anthropic would end up out of business.\n\nFrankly, this strikes me as a damage control response to stuff the US gov't is pressuring them about behind closed doors.",

The irony isn't just thick — it's the entire business model.  \n  \nThis isn't about national security.

It’s no longer just about \"AI safety\" in a lab—it’s now a full-blown national security and ethics standoff.\n\nI’ve summarized the key points of what’s happening because this could set a massive precedent for how LLMs are used in warfare.\n\n# The Conflict in a Nutshell:\n\nThe Pentagon is reportedly considering labeling Anthropic as a **\"supply chain risk.\"** This isn't just a slap on the wrist; it’s a potential blacklist that would force defense contractors (and partners like Palantir, Amazon, and Google) to cut ties.\n\n# Why is this happening?\n\nIt comes down to two specific \"Red Lines\" that Anthropic refuses to cross, even if the government says the use cases are legal:\n\n1. **No AI-powered mass surveillance of Americans.**\n2. **No autonomous weapons firing without a human in the loop.**\n\nThe Pentagon’s stance? **\"All Lawful Purposes.\"** They want to use the tools for anything that is legally permitted, arguing that in a \"war-fighting\" scenario, a vendor’s moral code shouldn’t override a commander’s lawful order.\n\n# The Trigger:\n\nReports surfaced that Claude was used during a mission in Venezuela (the Maduro raid) on January 3rd, 2026. While Anthropic denies any operational back-and-forth, the mere suggestion that a vendor might \"second-guess\" the military's use of its tool has sent the Department of Defense into a tailspin.\n\n# The Stakes:\n\nIf Anthropic caves, they lose their \"Safety-First\" identity. If they hold the line, they might get cut out of the federal ecosystem entirely. Meanwhile, competitors like OpenAI, xAI, and Google have reportedly been more \"flexible\" with their guardrails for military use.\n\n**I’m curious to hear what this sub thinks:**\n\n* Should an AI lab have the right to veto \"lawful\" government use of its tech?\n* Or does \"all lawful purposes\" become a dangerous blank check when AI scales surveillance to 100x?\n\n**Full breakdown of the situation here:** [https://www.revolutioninai.com/2026/02/pentagon-threatens-anthropic-ai-blacklist.html](https://www.revolutioninai.com/2026/02/pentagon-threatens-anthropic-ai-blacklist.html)",

      "text": "I've been building Charlotte, an open source MCP server that gives AI agents structured understanding of web pages through headless Chromium. Navigation, observation, interaction.. 30 tools across 6 categories.\n\nThe core idea: instead of dumping a raw accessibility tree into the context window, Charlotte decomposes pages into structured representations with landmarks, headings, interactive elements, and stable hash-based element IDs. Agents get three detail levels, minimal for orientation, summary for context, full for deep inspection, so they only spend tokens on what they actually need.\n\nI ran benchmarks against Playwright MCP (Microsoft's browser MCP server) and the results were significant:\n\n    Page             Charlotte     Playwright MCP\n    ─────────────────────────────────────────────\n    Wikipedia          7,667 ch     1,040,636 ch\n    GitHub repo        3,185 ch        80,297 ch\n    Hacker News          336 ch        61,230 ch\n\nA 100-page browsing session costs \\~$0.09 in input tokens on Claude Opus vs \\~$15.30 with Playwright MCP. The efficiency difference makes agent-driven web interaction viable for things like site exploration, form testing, and accessibility auditing at a scale that would be prohibitively expensive otherwise.\n\n**A note on Playwright CLI:** Microsoft recently released `@playwright/cli` as a more token-efficient alternative to Playwright MCP. It achieves \\~4x savings by writing snapshots and screenshots to disk files instead of returning them in context. I haven't benchmarked Charlotte against the CLI because they're fundamentally different modes of operation, the CLI requires filesystem and shell access, which means it only works with coding agents like Claude Code or Copilot. Charlotte is built for MCP-native execution: sandboxed environments, headless containerized pipelines, chat interfaces, and autonomous agent loops where filesystem access isn't available or desirable. Different tools for different contexts.\n\nSome things Charlotte does that Playwright MCP doesn't:\n\n* Three detail levels (agents choose context depth per call)\n* Landmark-grouped interactive summaries (minimal shows \"main: 1847 links, 3 buttons\" instead of listing all 1847)\n* Stable hash-based element IDs that survive DOM mutations\n* Structural diffing between page states\n* Semantic find by element type, text, or landmark\n* Built-in basic accessibility, SEO, and contrast audits\n* Local dev server with hot reload\n\nOne thing I'm proud of: Charlotte's own marketing site was built and verified entirely by an agent using Charlotte as its tool. The agent served the site locally with `dev_serve`, checked layouts with `screenshot`, tested interactive elements with `find` and `click`, caught a mobile overflow bug by reading bounding boxes, and fixed 16 unlabeled SVG icons, all without a human looking at the page.\n\nMIT licensed, published on npm, listed in the MCP registry.\n\n* **GitHub:** [https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte](https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte)\n* **npm:** [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ticktockbent/charlotte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ticktockbent/charlotte)\n* **Site:** [https://charlotte-rose.vercel.app](https://charlotte-rose.vercel.app)\n* **Benchmarks:** [https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte/blob/main/docs/charlotte-benchmark-report.md](https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte/blob/main/docs/charlotte-benchmark-report.md)\n* **Raw Results:** [https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte/tree/main/benchmarks/results/raw](https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte/tree/main/benchmarks/results/raw)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the architecture, the benchmarks, or anything else.

I had an agent test against charlotte's own github repo which has 26 shadow hosts (`<tool-tip>` elements (styled tooltips) and `<relative-time>` elements rendering text like \"17 hours ago\" in their shadow roots). Charlotte handled these all correctly. The AX tree extraction picked up the rendered content without any special handling and captured all interactive elements, labels, and text from the shadow DOM components.\n\nIframes did not go so well. I tested against a [w3schools.com](http://w3schools.com) page which has 5 embedded iframes including a same-origin one embedding a full tutorial page. None of the iframe content was captured because `Accessibility.getFullAXTree` operates on the main frame's accessibility tree only. Iframe content lives in a separate frame/process. I've added iframe handling to my roadmap and I think I could handle it by calling `Accessibility.getFullAXTree` for each frame target via CDP and merging the results into the main representation. That'd be a non-trivial feature addition though so it may take some time to get working properly.\n\nGood question! I wouldn't have tested this today otherwise.",

You add a config block to Claude Desktop or Claude Code, and Claude can browse your app like a user would.\n\nFor your admin panel: you build a page, tell Claude \"serve my project and check if the forms work on mobile,\" and Charlotte handles the rest, serves your files, switches to a mobile viewport, finds the forms, tests them, and reports back what happened. No test scripts, no selectors, just describe what you want checked. That's the part I've been enjoying the most, I describe my tests in natural language and the agent uses tool calls through the MCP. I used to waste so much time on playwright scripts...\n\nIt can see differences when states change, like testing whether dark mode affects all of the expected components or whatever, and can see when elements are misaligned or review a screenshot to make sure effects are applied correctly.",

From there it decides whether to call find to locate specific elements or observe at a higher detail level. There's no separate planning step because the detail levels are the planning mechanism. The agent never pays for full page detail unless it explicitly asks for it.\n\nIf your agent needs full context you can run in summary or full to pull more data initially or on subsequent tool calls while saving tokens where it's not as important. I use it in concert with some custom skills that help the model judge what detail level to use for different situations.",
