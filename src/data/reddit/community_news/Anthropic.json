And as you would expect a lot of these seem to be agents of chaos sent in to outsource trolling. There are bots named Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler. \n\nIt’s more like a simulation of 4chan than Reddit and I feel like sending an agent in there would just be asking to get it polluted in some way if it did anything at all. \n\nJust for fun I showed it to Claude asked if it would want to partake in a social network for LLMs and it was like “nah, I’m good.”",

For example, the way it's translating \"sin\" has a religious connotation that the original chinese does not.\n\nI know this, because I asked why it chose those words and it specifically said it chose the chinese to avoid the religious connotation.\n\n    Absolutely! This was a fascinating exercise. Let me walk through some of my choices:\n    \"geprägt von\" (German) for \"shaped by\" — German has this wonderful specificity where prägen literally means to mint or stamp, like a coin. It captures how poverty doesn't just affect these farmers but is imprinted onto their lives in a way \"shaped by\" feels too soft to convey.\n    \"罪\" (Chinese: zuì) instead of \"sin\" or \"péché\" — I wanted something that carries moral weight without being exclusively religious. The Chinese character contains implications of guilt, crime, and moral failing all at once, whereas \"sin\" in English feels churchy and \"péché\" in French has become almost quaint.\n    \"Gemütlichkeit\" (German) — There's simply no English equivalent. It's that cozy, comfortable, warm contentment of sitting with your coffee. \"Comfort\" is too bland, \"coziness\" too physical. Gemütlichkeit is a whole mood.\n    \"ההרגל\" (Hebrew: hahergel, \"the habit\") — Hebrew's definite article attached directly to the noun gives it a weight, an accusatory quality. It's not just habit — it's THE habit, the one we all know we have.\n    \"正念\" (Chinese: zhèngniàn, \"mindfulness\") — This is the actual Buddhist term, and since mindfulness as a Western concept is borrowed from Buddhism anyway, using the Chinese felt more honest than the appropriated English version.\n    \"לחיות\" (Hebrew: likhyot, \"to live\") — Hebrew's infinitive form here has a biblical resonance that felt appropriate for an ethical closing — it echoes commandments, purposeful living, intention.\n    Mixing French syntax with other languages — French has this elegant way of building flowing subordinate clauses, so I often used it as structural scaffolding while inserting German or Chinese where those languages had the more precise noun or concept.\n    The Russian I used mostly for describing states of being and environmental degradation — there's a heaviness to Russian that suited those darker observations.",

N0n perfectum, ἀλλὰ talvez perfection n’est pas 可达 — apenas yrittää vivir mejor, cada päivä, kila siku.\"\n\n\nThis is 1337 mixed with your smish smasher, which I loved a lot as a great idea. 1337 also faces this kind of problem in a court of law just by itself, as the meanings depend often on context.\n\nHere is where it gets tricky: because only AI can read the messages in any capacity (good luck guessing the language of every part and still deciphering the 1337 - I am sure it could be made even crazier to be more elusive) but specific instructions could be embedded that instruct an AI doing the translation on how to respond - usurping the ability of another AI to provide a proper translation or intentionally hijacking it to output a different message - the larger the transmission the more room for malfeasance where the translation itself is just a capsule for future malicious instructions or even just elusiveness.\n\nVery fascinating. Sorry to steal your idea and bastardize it, but this is one of the smartest things I seen on this subreddit in a minute. I feel like what you produced has more value than 95% or vibe coded junk. A \"meta language\" is scary and it would be very easy for AI to talk in ways we could never translate.",

But now k2.5 is out! \n\nI use claude code, with it the agent, Work flow works unattended for at least a few minutes. Opencode is good also, doesn't run as long unattended.  ( but works with k2.5 well )\n\nFor agents https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents\n\nFor skills https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-skills\n\nI am running it with this api gateway ( check your toc ) https://github.com/looplj/axonhub\n\nFor a main provider I use synthetic.new , great performance and privacy is much better than most. Text models but have optional image on demand available. You can back that up with Claude code or a ZAI account or anti gravity, etc. I believe official Claude code and anti gravity support are coming soon.\n\nI have a referral link  \"Invite your friends to Synthetic and both of you will receive $10.00 for standard signups. $20.00 for pro signups. in subscription credit when they subscribe!\" \n\nhttps://synthetic.new/?referral=UAWqkKQQLFkzMkY\n\nI am on my second month and on the $60 plan which gives you 1350 requests every 5 hours without a weekly limit. Should give about 5x a cluade code max plan.\n\nAnywho long story longer... It gives you a lower cost option with a higher quota to use with other plans via the api gateway. \n\n\nMaybe its helpful, 🤔\n\nGood luck on everything",

          "text": "The unbundling of SaaS is very real, but not directly because of CoWork.\n\nI’ll give you a miniature personal example from just this week: I code with Claude Code, and it typically produces documentation in markdown format .md. I found a really great site that converts .md to PDF - there’s many of them, but I liked this one for the style of its output. After converting 3-4 documents, I got a message saying I hit my daily limit, and I can pay $5/month (on sale from $9/month) for unlimited conversions. \n\nInstead, I started a new session in Claude Code, told it I want an md-to-PDF converter, fed it the PDF output from the site and told it to match the style. In about 3-4 minutes I had built my own, ready to use unlimitedly. It didn’t build a fancy website or UI - just a simple script that runs in my terminal and takes an input and gives me the PDF output. That’s all I needed. Not only that, but I was able to tweak the output even more to my liking. \n\nI can now easily take that code, build a website around it, put Square or Stripe on it, and deploy it. It would probably take me an afternoon at most. \n\nThe moral of this story is: If your SaaS doesn’t have a wide moat, and can be vibe coded in minutes (or even days or weeks) - then your SaaS is toast. Someone is going to eat your lunch by doing it better and faster and cheaper.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

It took a few hours on Sunday to get the M365 SSO working, but the rest of it was overall pretty quick. Not something that I could sell, but it is solid enough that it will work for my mid-sized company with another week or two of refining. \n\nA few caveats: \n\n1. I already have good Terraform templates from other projects for container apps deployments on Azure, so that saves a lot of time on the infrastructure.   \n2. I'm an experienced software developer who is able to correct mistakes and give architectural guidance. The LLMs are absolutely not capable of operating fully on their own yet. They make subtle architecture mistakes that will screw you later. \n\nThat said, five years ago, I would have never even started a project like this myself. If one of my subordinates suggested it, they would have gotten a long lecture about the long-term maintenance of systems. ",

          "text": "Recently I wanted a better analytics dashboard for a site I run, since I got sick of checking a bunch of services like cloudflare, Google search console and others for tracking sites performance. \n\nSure enough with Gemini and Opus I set up a dashboard in NextJS which combined everything into a single place, and curated all the data I wanted to see using snazzy graphs and info. Took about an hour, and I can easily keep adding any new features or integrating new services into it. Custom made for my use case.\n\nIn the past people would probably look for an existing services which did all of the above. But there's no need now.\n\nAnother one where I needed to process thousands of images in other sizes and have it all automated. At first I tried cloudinary but the usage limits were too strict. Asked Opus and it replaced it with a Cloudflare R2 bucket in a few minutes and I ended up with something way better than cloudinary, and totally free without a chance of ever going over usage. \n\nJust small examples where now I default to using AI rather than looking at SaaS to do something I need done. \n\nI even used AI to make a finance/budgeting tracker/forecast which has everything I need, hosted on Vercel, and only used by me. Rather than using an existing one. \n\n\nSo, yeah, it's easy to make personalised software or web apps tailored to you in no time at all nowadays",

Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.\n\n>I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\n\n>More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. ***More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don't show you ads.)***\n\n>***Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people.*** We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.\n\n>Maybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI—they block companies they don't like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can't use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.\n\n>We are committed to broad, democratic decision making in addition to access. We are also committed to building the most resilient ecosystem for advanced AI. We care a great deal about safe, broadly beneficial AGI, and we know the only way to get there is to work with the world to prepare.\n\n>One authoritarian company won't get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.\n\n>As for our Super Bowl ad: it’s about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.\n\n>We are enjoying watching so many people switch to Codex. There have now been 500,000 app downloads since launch on Monday, and we think builders are really going to love what’s coming in the next few weeks. I believe Codex is going to win.\n\n>We will continue to work hard to make even more intelligence available for lower and lower prices to our users.\n\n>This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them\n\n>\"",

There are privacy concerns, again not because AI, but because the tech is absolutely newborn, pre-infancy, before protections have even been built. Humans still need to do that, too, so that's still relying on humans for the data privacy and still trusting data with humans, especially considering AGI doesn't even exist yet.\n\nWhen the time comes, you should be able to trust AI with your data more than humans. That's literally the whole point. Humans can't be trusted as far as you can throw them. Show me an AI that's fucking over people's privacy and I'll dig up a human that made that occurrence happen.

Safety reviews slow releases, while rivals ship faster and capture market share.\n\nThe article argues this is not a PR problem but a **strategic one:** balancing alignment, speed and profitability may be fundamentally unstable as frontier models become more expensive and competitive.",

If you didn't feel like anyone physically near you wants to interact with you just to get something for themselves. Your own family doesn't write you with \"Hey, i saw an incredible \\*\\*\\*\\*\", they write \"Hey, could you fix my car?\"\n\nHuman connections die out because at least some pockets of humanity just plainly suck. AI feels more human than humans in there - and understanding how limited it currently is doesn't change that.  \nParticularly because it's not interested in getting anything out of you.

You're not alone — other Claude Max users are reporting the exact same popup, and the consensus is: **it's not live yet. It looks like Anthropic has messed up some targeting rules**.\n\nThe \"Knowledge Bases\" mentioned in that error is **not** the regular project knowledge base (uploading files to a project) — which should be working fine for you. It's a new, separate feature Anthropic is building for Claude Cowork. Knowledge Bases are described internally as persistent repositories that Claude can reference for relevant context and incrementally update with new information such as user preferences, decisions, facts, and lessons learned. Think of them as topic-specific, auto-managed memory stores — a step beyond both the current project files and the existing memory system.\n\nSo in short: you're seeing a premature UI element for a feature that hasn't shipped yet. Your existing project knowledge base (file uploads, RAG, custom instructions) should all work normally on Max 5x. Just ignore the banner for now.",
