And this is one of those cases.\n\nI work on a service that runs in AWS and depends on a fair number of AWS services - S3, DDB, EventBridge, Fargate, Lambda, SQS, and probably others I've forgotten about. Testing the full service and running end-to-end tests is painful, and requires deploying a lot of CFN stacks to a dev account.\n\nWe have started using agents to write our code (Kiro CLI + Claude 4.5 Opus) and are producing _far_ more code than we can realistically test. So we needed a new way to test it that the agents could use without human intervention.\n\nI watched a video where someone talked about exactly this problem, and he suggested faking your dependencies and testing locally; that is a lot of work, but it is the kind of work that AI can do extremely easily. It's not complicated or subtle, it just requires knowledge of all the AWS APIs.\n\nIn a few days of running an agent as a background task while I did my day job I had the entire service running on my laptop without using a single real AWS service. The agent built local HTTP servers that fake the AWS service APIs so my service code SDK calls still work. I just have to set `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_<SERVICE>` to override the service URL to be `localhost:<port>`.\n\nI never would have thought is was possible until I tried it, but I believe it now. I think this is one of the challenges of adopting AI - opening your eyes to the things that you never would have considered before, but which are possible now.\n\nEdit: To clarify, my fake AWS services only implement the small subset of the AWS API that my service code uses. Faking the _entire_ API for all of those services would be a big job, but it's one you don't have to do if you are faking services just for your use case.",

      "text": "Hello, my team has been using Bedrock since its infancy and we're a platinum tier Amazon partner. Here are my suggestions for Bedrock:\n\n\\* Add a new **embedding model**. Titan v2 is ok, but its 2 years old. Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B is much better at 1024 dimensions. There are many open source models that excel at 512 dimensions also. We're using EC2 (or really ECS with EC2) to host them locally, but having them in Bedrock at a reasonable price would make things easier to maintain.\n\n\\* Add some inexpensive and easy to use **reranker** models that are open source. Cohere is just too expensive... we've been hosting some models on EC2, but we'd rather use Bedrock for jina-reranker-v3 / mxbai-rerank-large-v1 / bge-reranker-v2-m3 / qwen3-reranker-0.6B. \n\n\\* You're fast to add Anthropic models, which we really appreciate. But can you add other open source LLMs that you started investing into already? Where is **DeepSeek v3.2**? Where is **Kimi K2.5**? **MiniMax 2.1**? It feels like a lot of models you host are slightly outdated.\n\n\\* I don't know if anyone is using your **Nova models**. We've benchmarked them, and for the price/performance they always fall short. Sorry... If they were 2x cheaper, we would probably use them in some places.\n\nThis is my team's feedback on AWS Bedrock. I'm curious what other people think about Bedrock and where its lacking.",

Titan v2 was fine when it launched but the open source space has moved so far ahead that hosting your own on ECS starts making more sense, which kind of defeats the purpose of a managed service. Same story with rerankers, Cohere pricing just doesn't work if you're doing any serious volume of reranking. Would love to see them add jina-reranker-v3 or even the smaller qwen models as first-class Bedrock options.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m noticing a significant discrepancy in behavior between legacy Network Load Balancers and newly created ones regarding how they handle DNS for Availability Zones with 0 registered targets.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n* **Architecture:** Internet-facing NLB -> Target Group (Instance Type) -> K8s Nodes (NodePort).\n* **Cross-Zone Load Balancing:** **Disabled** (intentionally, for cost/latency reasons in a specific multi-AZ setup).\n* **Scenario:** 3 AZs with one specific AZ (e.g., `ca-central-1d`) has no healthy targets (0 nodes).\n\n**The Discrepancy:**\n\n1. **Old NLB (Created \\~2024):**\n   * **Behavior:** The NLB automatically removes the IP address of the empty AZ from the DNS record.\n   * **Result:** `dig comand` returns only 2 IPs (for the healthy AZs). Traffic is never routed to the empty AZ. Everything works.\n   * If we terminate all instances from the first AZ (1a) with AWS FIS, the DNS assigned from this AZ was also removed, so we have only one DNS remaining.\n2. **New NLB (Created Feb 2026):**\n   * **Configuration:** Identical to the old one (Terraform/OpenTofu code is the same).\n   * **Behavior:** The NLB **continues to publish the IP** of the empty AZ in the DNS record.\n   * **Result:** `dig` returns 3 IPs. Client traffic is round-robined to the empty AZ (\\~33% of requests). Since Cross-Zone is disabled and there are no local targets, these packets are blackholed, causing immediate connection timeouts/failures.\n\n**Support's Response:** I opened a ticket, and AWS Support claims *\"*After reviewing your case and consulting with our internal resources, I can confirm that \\*\\*this is the expected behavior for Network Load Balancers\\*\\*, and there has been no recent change to how NLBs handle DNS resolution for AZs with no registered targets*.\"*\n\nHowever, the empirical evidence (side-by-side `dig` results on same-region, same-config LBs) suggests otherwise.\n\n**The Impact:** This feels like a silent breaking change. Previously, we relied on the NLB's ability to \"drain\" an AZ from DNS if the backend was dead (fail-open style). Now, it seems new NLBs are \"sticky\" to their AZs regardless of backend health, which breaks standard DR/Failover patterns where you might spin down an AZ to save costs or during an outage.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Has anyone else noticed this shift in \"Fail Open\" behavior on recent NLBs?\n* Is there a new attribute (hidden or documented) that controls this \"DNS draining\" behavior?\n* Is the only solution now to force Cross-Zone Load Balancing (and pay the transfer costs) or manually manipulate Subnet mappings during an incident?\n\nThanks for any insights.",

Think about ransomware.\n3. You have backup solutions for that - AWS backup, Rubrik, Commvault, etc. Not cheap but real backup solutions. \n4. Goofle drive and most backup solutions/vendors - those do not provide INCREMENTAL changes so if you change a small portion of a file/object, you need to save the whole copy.\n4.

If a handwritten '5' looks like an 'S', Textract often guesses wrong based on pixel shape alone. A Vision LLM (like GPT-4o or Claude) looks at the surrounding text, understands it's a 'Quantity' field, and correctly identifies it as '5'.\n\n​Textract is definitely superior for bounding boxes (coordinates) and pure speed on massive datasets. But if your goal is extracting structured JSON from complex/messy documents where field logic matters more than pixel-perfect coordinates, Vision models are usually cheaper and more accurate in practice. We actually benchmarked this extensively for ParserData and found Vision models reduced 'logic errors' by nearly 40% compared to raw Textract output.",

The main problem I've had is essentially the LLM \"count to 100\" or \"how many r's are in strawberry\" problem.\n\nLLM would often give a slower and incomplete response, hitting token limits, hallucinating details or re-interpret some lines. I tried again more recently and the models flat out do a tool call to Tesseract.\n\nIt really depends what your use case is though and how accurate you need the OCR. If you have a good quality source image with high DPI and text is well aligned, you get a long way. Textract does give a confidence value on the interpreted text and at the end of the day, Textract is using AI/ML for it's engine, it's just not LLM.",

You can create an Internet gateway to route to/from the internet, or endpoints (think network port) to give access to other services.\n\nInside the vpc you could put an EC2 instance, or RDS database etc.  if it has an IP address it's got an interface connected to your VPC.\n\nA thing in your VPC can also have a security group which is like a simple firewall which defines what traffic is allowed in or out.  This can reference an IP range, or another security group.\n\nBeyond that there are DHCP options, acls etc but honestly, they're way less important.  When you need them you'll know why and Google will be your friend 🙂\n\nOne slightly odd definition that is confusing to start with is public/private subnets.\n\nIn a public subnet you route 0.0.0.0/0 to the Internet gateway.  In a private subnet you don't!  That way resources in the private subnet cannot access or be accessed from the internet.  You can add a NAT gateway if you need outbound internet.  Ironically, because the NAT gateway needs Internet access it lives in the public subnet, but your private route tables have a default route to it.\n\nI hope that's helpful.  AWS networking is weirdly simple once you get used to it, but it can be very confusing initially 👍",

Think of Network ACLs as \"dumb\" rules that just work on IP address and port numbers, akin to `iptables` and they're applied on the subnet level.  Security Groups are smarter - instead of just IP ranges as sources/targets you can use rules like \"members of this security group\", \"members of another security group\", etc. and they're applied on the security group level (which can span several subnets).\n\nI'd strongly advise you use one or the other, never both if you can help it.  Using both together is just a recipe for confusion when traffic isn't working that you think should be because of interactions between the two.  The one you use should (nearly) always be security groups.  Only use network ACLs if you really know what you're doing and have a specific need.  They usually only come into play when you're doing fancier stuff like VPC peering or connecting your VPC back to your datacenter with a VPN.",

It's a Python ORM but the heavy lifting happens in Rust via PyO3.\n\nWanted to share how I handle async because I think it's interesting.\n\n## The problem with most Python DynamoDB libraries\n\nThey either do sync-only, or they wrap sync calls with `asyncio.to_thread()`. That's not real async. You're still blocking a thread somewhere.\n\n## What I do instead\n\nThe Rust core uses Tokio (Rust's async runtime) to talk to DynamoDB. When you call an async method from Python, it goes like this:\n\n1. Python `await`s the call\n2. PyO3 hands it to Tokio on the Rust side\n3. Tokio makes the HTTP request without holding the GIL\n4. Result comes back to Python\n\nThe GIL is released during the entire network call. Your other Python coroutines keep running. No threads wasted sitting idle waiting for DynamoDB to respond.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nThis helps in any Python app — Lambda, ECS, FastAPI, Django, scripts, whatever.\n\n- Serialization/deserialization happens in Rust — type conversion is fast\n- Compression (zstd) and encryption (AES-GCM) also run in Rust with the GIL released\n- Zero Python runtime dependencies, so installs are small and there are no conflicts\n- On Lambda specifically, cold starts stay lean and warm invocations hit the Rust fast path\n\n## Quick example\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom pydynox import Model, ModelConfig, DynamoDBClient\n\nclient = DynamoDBClient()\n\nclass User(Model):\n    model_config = ModelConfig(table=\"users\")\n    pk: str\n    name: str\n    email: str\n\nasync def main():\n    user = User(pk=\"USER#1\", name=\"John\", email=\"john@example.com\")\n    await user.save()\n\n    found = await User.get(pk=\"USER#1\")\n    print(found.name)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nSync works too — same API, just drop the `await`.\n\n## Performance\n\nSerialization alone is faster because Rust handles the Python-to-DynamoDB type conversion directly instead of going through multiple dict transformations.\n\nThe library is Apache 2.0 and on GitHub.\n\nDocs: [https://ferrumio.github.io/pydynox/](https://ferrumio.github.io/pydynox/)\n\nIf you've tried mixing Rust and Python for AWS stuff, I'd love to hear how it went. Questions are welcome too.\n",

Other threads will happily run while waiting on the HTTP response.\n\nThe other reasons are more compelling:  boto3 is a humongous dependency and its serde is quite slow.",

      "text": "Lex bots use a legacy keyword-based utterance matching approach for intent selection. For all but the simplest contact center solutions, this isn’t a great fit.\n\nConversational prompt–based intent selection is more accurate, provides a better CX experience, and eliminates the need for questions designed to constrain CX replies to specific keywords. It also removes the painful maintenance work of managing long keyword lists to keep intent matching accurate.\n\nTo put it more bluntly, I see Lex bots as technical debt. I continually have to engineer around them to create dynamic interactions that feel like real conversations, rather than a “bot with slots” experience.\n\nI believe a new type of “Get Customer Input” block is needed — one that can interact directly with my prompts and Bedrock. This would allow seamless data exchange between Connect and the conversational AI layer, enabling path and route selections based on GenAI responses rather than basic keyword matching.\n\nI’m aware that Lex now supports “generative assessment” for keyword intents. However, in my testing, enabling this made intent selection worse, not better. The reality is that keyword-based selection simply doesn’t work for advanced conversational interactions — especially when customers may not know the exact keyword that corresponds to their reason for calling.\n\nI’m a huge fan of Connect and have used it for years, but lately, working with Lex has become frustrating. It creates more barriers than bridges, and I believe that’s a serious issue.",
