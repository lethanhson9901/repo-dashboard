      "text": "Hey all.\n\n  Quick post of something I noticed over the weekend which might trip up someone else.\n\n\nWas pushing a Docker image into ECR using a GitHub Actions deployment workflow, a workflow that's been same-same for a good six months and suddenly two days prior was failing with the following error:\n\n```\nunknown: unexpected status from HEAD request to https://XXXXX.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/v2/XXXX/XXXX/manifests/sha256:XXXX: 403 Forbidden\nmake: *** [Makefile:68: burp] Error 1\nError: Process completed with exit code 2.\n```\n\nAfter a little head scratching, I pulled out a few community threads via Google - all from 1 - 2 years ago, but suspiciously had some very recent comments (two days prior) on them with similar issues:\n\n- https://repost.aws/questions/QUYf5U-mW3SqaYKFEvbr9fzw/suddenly-getting-403-on-pushing-my-containers-to-ecs\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79137398/gitlab-cicd-issue-403-forbidden-while-pushing-docker-image-to-aws-ecr\n\nThe IAM role used in my GitHub workflow was (as it should be) fairly restrictive - with the following IAM actions only:\n\n```\necr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability\necr:CompleteLayerUpload\necr:InitiateLayerUpload\necr:PutImage\necr:UploadLayerPart\n```\n\nThese are all honed against a [specific ECR repository ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonelasticcontainerregistry.html#amazonelasticcontainerregistry-repository).\n\nTurns out, adding `ecr:BatchGetImage` was the fix - this provides the ability for querying image digests from within ECR, which is exactly where the HTTP HEAD error lies.\n\nSo, it seems a recent release of Docker CLI has changed the behavior of `docker push` to now query image digests during an image push and I can only assume this version recently landed on GitHub managed workflow runners.\n\nAnyway... hopefully this helps someone else out of a bind!\n",

I would just create a {pk TENANT#<tenant-id>, sk:METADATA} for each tenant, that has a property TYPE=TENANT and use a GSI to query for the type, to get a full tenant list or something similiar. But would be more worried, that your general pk/sk design leads to hot partitioning, since your pk is always the tenant id, and the pk determines the partition. What I do is, to break it down into subcategories. like {pk: TENANT#<tenant-id>#USER, sk: <user-id>} or {pk: TENANT#<tenant-id>#PROJECT, sk: <project-id>}. That would be already two distinct paritition, instead of a single one by just using the pattern {pk: TENANT#<tenant-id>, sk: PROJECT#<project-id>}, where all items for that tenant compete for the same 1,000 WCU / 3,000 RCU per-partition throughput limit. That works also well for me, since i usually have dedicated api routes for subcategories. What is your security model to enforce tenant isolation?",

              "text": "Great points — here's my thinking:\n\nTenant index isn't really a worry because it's an admin operation with low volume. I've handled this with the TENANT\\_LIST GSI, but your TYPE=TENANT approach seems functionally similar.\n\nSplitting PKs into subcategories is an interesting approach - you spread writes across multiple partitions with the tradeoff that you lose the ability to read across entity types in a single operation. I think this really depends on the access patterns. For the multi-tenant case, being able to query \\`TENANT#<id>\\` and get metadata + subscription + users in one call is something I reach for a lot.  \nFor most SaaS apps, from what I understand, the hot partition concern is overblown - 1,000 WCU per partition is a lot, and since 2018 DynamoDB's adaptive capacity redistributes throughput to handle hot partitions without you needing to intervene. It won't proactively split them, but it handles the imbalance. If you're at a scale where a single tenant is consistently pushing past that, you probably have bigger architectural decisions to make anyway.\n\nThe tenant isolation point is legit and something I should address in the article. In my production apps I handle this at the application layer (tRPC + OpenAuth — every query is scoped to the authenticated tenant). I'm aware of IAM fine-grained access control with \\`dynamodb:LeadingKeys\\` condition keys as the DB-level option, but haven't needed it yet. Have you had success with that approach in practice, or is there something else you'd recommend?",

So basically, I make sure that the relevant data (tenant id, role, etc) is part of the signed access token, like you do. I have predefined IAM roles with role tags, using the LeadingKeys pattern, and at the API level, the actual dynamodb requests are being done while assuming those roles. This will enforce tenant isolation. But I also have more RBAC/ABAC style of permissions enforced at the middleware level. For all that I build an universal authentication and authorisation system I deploy once (or as often as I want to get more isolation for other reasons)  and can reuse for any other app. It's just plug and play at this point. But was a lot of work to get there. But at the moment I'm still doing REST APIs. Which works nicely, because I'm running Hono with OpenAPI extension, where I only have to define a zod schema as single source of truth, and can easily generate the correctly typed client code via the OpenAPI specs, it automatically generates from that. But the system would work with GraphQL too. ",

At 100 tenants that's manageable. At 10,000 it's a nightmare.  \n\\- Cross-tenant queries become expensive - \"List all tenants\" or \"aggregate usage across tenants\" requires scanning every table.  \n\\- AWS account limits - There's a default limit of 2,500 tables per account per region. You can request increases, but it's a signal you're fighting the grain.  \n\\- Cost - Each table with on-demand pricing has its own minimum throughput allocation. One shared table is cheaper than N separate ones.\n\nThe single-table approach gives you logical isolation (tenant-scoped partition keys) with the operational simplicity of one table. If you need stronger isolation, the IAM LeadingKeys approach another commenter mentioned gives you DB-level enforcement without separate tables.\n\nThat said, table-per-tenant is the right call for some use cases — particularly when tenants have wildly different scale or strict data residency requirements. It's not wrong, just different tradeoffs.",

              "text": "Good question - this is one of the genuine pain points with DynamoDB, and one that kept me sticking to rdbms for a very long time. \n\nFor attribute-level changes (adding a new field, changing a default), it's straightforward - DynamoDB is schemaless per item, so new items get the new attribute and old items don't. I handle backfills lazily at read time or with a one-off migration script depending on whether the field is required.\n\nFor key structure changes (modifying a PK/SK pattern or GSI), it's more involved. You can't alter keys on existing items - you have to write new items with the new key pattern and clean up the old ones. ElectroDB's versioning helps here: you define a new entity version and can read both old and new formats during the transition.\n\nFor GSI changes, adding a new GSI is non-disruptive (DynamoDB backfills it from the existing table). Changing or removing one requires a migration plan.\n\nHonestly, this is probably the strongest argument against overly complex single-table designs - the more entities and overloaded indexes you have, the harder migrations get. It's why I'd rather start with clean, well-separated key prefixes and only overload GSIs when the access patterns are stable.\n\nSchema migration tooling is a big gap in the DynamoDB ecosystem right now. It's something I'm thinking about for singletable.dev down the road.",

Multi-table DynamoDB still requires you to define access patterns before you design. It's not a relational database where you can normalize first and figure out queries later.\n\nWhere I'd push back: single-table isn't all-or-nothing. The modern approach is pragmatic - group entities that are queried together, use a few clean GSIs, don't overload everything into one index just because you can. That's what this pattern does.\n\nThat said, if your app's access patterns are genuinely unknown and/or evolving fast, DynamoDB itself might not be the right choice - and that's a totally valid position.",

Previously, customers could only create and manage virtual machines inside bare metal EC2 instances. With this launch, customers can create nested virtual machines by running KVM or Hyper-V on virtual EC2 instances. Customers can leverage this capability for use cases such as running emulators for mobile applications, simulating in-vehicle hardware for automobiles, and running Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows workstations.\n\nThis capability is available in all commercial regions on C8i, M8i, and R8i instances.

If a handwritten '5' looks like an 'S', Textract often guesses wrong based on pixel shape alone. A Vision LLM (like GPT-4o or Claude) looks at the surrounding text, understands it's a 'Quantity' field, and correctly identifies it as '5'.\n\n​Textract is definitely superior for bounding boxes (coordinates) and pure speed on massive datasets. But if your goal is extracting structured JSON from complex/messy documents where field logic matters more than pixel-perfect coordinates, Vision models are usually cheaper and more accurate in practice. We actually benchmarked this extensively for ParserData and found Vision models reduced 'logic errors' by nearly 40% compared to raw Textract output.",

There are other blogs where people did similar.\n\nI've done some pretty extensive testing myself with using LLM (mainly Claude 3.7 generation) vs. Textract on scanned paper documents. The main problem I've had is essentially the LLM \"count to 100\" or \"how many r's are in strawberry\" problem.\n\nLLM would often give a slower and incomplete response, hitting token limits, hallucinating details or re-interpret some lines. I tried again more recently and the models flat out do a tool call to Tesseract.\n\nIt really depends what your use case is though and how accurate you need the OCR. If you have a good quality source image with high DPI and text is well aligned, you get a long way. Textract does give a confidence value on the interpreted text and at the end of the day, Textract is using AI/ML for it's engine, it's just not LLM.",

      "text": "Hey r/aws,\n\nI've been working on an open source DynamoDB library called **pydynox**. It's a Python ORM but the heavy lifting happens in Rust via PyO3.\n\nWanted to share how I handle async because I think it's interesting.\n\n## The problem with most Python DynamoDB libraries\n\nThey either do sync-only, or they wrap sync calls with `asyncio.to_thread()`. That's not real async. You're still blocking a thread somewhere.\n\n## What I do instead\n\nThe Rust core uses Tokio (Rust's async runtime) to talk to DynamoDB. When you call an async method from Python, it goes like this:\n\n1. Python `await`s the call\n2. PyO3 hands it to Tokio on the Rust side\n3. Tokio makes the HTTP request without holding the GIL\n4. Result comes back to Python\n\nThe GIL is released during the entire network call. Your other Python coroutines keep running. No threads wasted sitting idle waiting for DynamoDB to respond.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nThis helps in any Python app — Lambda, ECS, FastAPI, Django, scripts, whatever.\n\n- Serialization/deserialization happens in Rust — type conversion is fast\n- Compression (zstd) and encryption (AES-GCM) also run in Rust with the GIL released\n- Zero Python runtime dependencies, so installs are small and there are no conflicts\n- On Lambda specifically, cold starts stay lean and warm invocations hit the Rust fast path\n\n## Quick example\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom pydynox import Model, ModelConfig, DynamoDBClient\n\nclient = DynamoDBClient()\n\nclass User(Model):\n    model_config = ModelConfig(table=\"users\")\n    pk: str\n    name: str\n    email: str\n\nasync def main():\n    user = User(pk=\"USER#1\", name=\"John\", email=\"john@example.com\")\n    await user.save()\n\n    found = await User.get(pk=\"USER#1\")\n    print(found.name)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nSync works too — same API, just drop the `await`.\n\n## Performance\n\nSerialization alone is faster because Rust handles the Python-to-DynamoDB type conversion directly instead of going through multiple dict transformations.\n\nThe library is Apache 2.0 and on GitHub.\n\nDocs: [https://ferrumio.github.io/pydynox/](https://ferrumio.github.io/pydynox/)\n\nIf you've tried mixing Rust and Python for AWS stuff, I'd love to hear how it went. Questions are welcome too.\n",

Other threads will happily run while waiting on the HTTP response.\n\nThe other reasons are more compelling:  boto3 is a humongous dependency and its serde is quite slow.",

My question is AWS Cognito  right step or should we look other options  like okta or OAuth ? What you people have experienced during migration  ?

By the time the whole process finishes usage has already changed and the analysis is outdated.\n\nCommitment recommendations in cost explorer are okay as a starting point but they don't account for upcoming projects, seasonal traffic patterns or planned architecture changes. They just look at historical usage and say \"buy this much\" which is often wrong.\n\nUnder committing means leaving savings on the table, over-committing means paying for capacity you don't use and the optimal middle ground requires constant adjustment. Three year commitments save more but lock you in longer which is risky for startups where everything changes constantly.\n\nCoverage percentage drops randomly when workloads shift and you need to evaluate whether to buy more which savings plan type makes sense (compute vs ec2) and what term length is appropriate. Feels like this should be automated somehow but I haven't found anything that actually works reliably\n\nIs there a good workflow for this or is manual quarterly analysis just the reality?",
