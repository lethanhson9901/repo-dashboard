Like it’s no big deal to wipe out these new grads and mid-levels who’ve been grinding here, just to save a buck for the shareholders. I don’t have kids but I think about those new grads all day today. They are someone’s kids, who went to the best CS schools and grinded their asses off to get a job here, and now they’re just getting replaced like nothing.\n\n> Today really hit me. Walked into standup and I’m literally the only non-Indian left in my entire org. I know you read that and thought I’m exaggerating. I’m not. Feels like I’m a stranger in what used to be my home. Corporate greed wins again, and politicians who left their citizens to protect the companies by importing labor and keeping blind eyes on offshore.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1qpuuqo/aws_just_gutted_us_teams/\n\nI don't care what anyone says.

I hated seeing her struggle.  She was / still is a hard working American.  She didn't do anything wrong.\n\nI hate seeing hard working Americans get treated like shit.  Yes, Americans are expensive because everything is expensive here.  Our healthcare, food, shelter, and education all expensive.  I want them to be cheaper but the ultra-wealthy fucks can't seem to pull their heads out of their ass and realize that where they live.  Maybe they think they can flee to another country, or bunker, but they can't.  The US, may not exist as they know it for long given what is happening to hard working Americans.  It is like being pecked to death by ducks.\n\nIt isn't just Amazon.  It is the uncertainty for all Americans about their job future.  There is no guarantee that if you just work hard you will have a job that at least affords enough for you and your family.\n\nRant over, I am tired of this.",

If you're running 24x7x30, it certainly doesn't make sense. You can literally buy a new mac each month for the same cost.

I've even consulted on projects where a company opted to not even bother with Android or deprecate their Android app because the revenue captured wasn't enough and the tech advantage to Apple is very high for a small shop.",

If you go to Supermicro and play with their configurator, you will find their rent-to-buy ratio, though not as crazy as 20 days, will probably just be a few months.\n\nThen, we have the issues that Mac minis are too small. AWS probably needs to install the same hardware for a single Mac mini as they do for a big dual socket AMD server. In the latter case, they can split the machine into many smaller instances to amortize the cost. Mathematically speaking, (M + n)/n > (M + N)/N, where n < N, and in particular if M is about the same as n but insignificant compared to N.\n\nLastly, I suppose there was significant R&D involved putting Macs into AWS, and the total volume they could sell would be insignificant compared to traditional servers. That must have some impact to their pricing decision as well.",

Typically you find out the reasoning behind most of these cases is multiple red flags that AWS notices. personal prepaid cards being used to pay for a supposed business, questionable user base and activity that seemingly appears overnight in a very new account, odd usage patterns and constantly changing login locations, sketchy business description (likely edging toward scam or fraud)...\n\nMy point is, they don't just suspend accounts with zero reason. We see a lot of these nightmare scenarios posted here, but whenever I've been able to dig deeper, there are legitimate reasons that OP doesn't share about what flagged their account in the first place. The idea it's been escalated so much according to them and they are still suspended is just another clue that there is more to the story.",

      "text": "Been using AWS Bedrock for a GenAI project at work for about six months now, and honestly, it's been... interesting. I came across this guide by an Amazon Applied Scientist (Stephen Bridwell, if you're curious) who's built systems processing billions of interactions, and it got me thinking about my own setup.\n\nFirst of, the model access is legit – having Claude, Llama, Titan all in one place is convenient. But man, the quotas... getting increases was such a hassle, and testing in production because nonprod accounts get nada? Feels janky. The guide mentions right-sizing models to save costs, like using Haiku for simple stuff instead of Sonnet for everything, which I totally screwed up early on. Wasted a bunch of credits before I figured that out.\n\nSecurity-wise, Bedrock's VPC endpoints and IAM integration are solid, no complaints there. But the instability... random errors during invocations, especially around that us-east-1 outage period. And the documentation? Sometimes it's just wrong, spent hours debugging only to find the SDK method didn't work as advertised. \n\nHmm, actually, let me backtrack a bit – the Knowledge Bases for RAG are pretty slick once you get the chunking right. But data prep is key, and if your docs are messy, it's gonna suck. Learned that the hard way after a few failed prototypes.\n\nCost optimization tips from the guide were helpful, like using batch mode for non-urgent jobs and prompt caching. Still, monitoring token usage is a pain, and I wish the CloudWatch integration was more intuitive.\n\nWhat's been your experience? Anyone else hit throttling issues or found workarounds for the quotas madness? Or maybe you've had smoother sailing – curious what models you're using and for what projects. \n\nAlso, if you've tried building agents or using Multi-Agent Collaboration, how'd that go? I heard it's janky, but I haven't done in yet.\n\nJust trying to figure out if I'm missing something or if Bedrock's just inherently fiddly for production GenAI.",

For example, restoring an RDS database from a snapshot using Terraform used to take consistently around **20 minutes**. Lately, the exact same operation (same configuration, same snapshot size) is taking upwards of **45 minutes**.\n\nIt's not just isolated to RDS either; I'm seeing similar delays across other services during `terraform apply`.\n\n**Context:**\n\n* **IaC:** Terraform\n* **Region:** eu-central-1\n* **Timeframe:** Comparison between \\~3 months ago vs. now.\n\nHas anyone else observed this? I'm trying to figure out if this is an account-specific issue (throttling/quotas?), a specific region issue, or if the control plane performance has actually degraded globally.\n\nThanks",

We've been a partner since 2022 and I know how overwhelming things might seem.\n\nYou first need to decide which path you want to take - [see here](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/paths/). As a VoIP solutions provider, it seems the software path might be the one to start with. i.e: build your solution on top of AWS and distribute it to customers through AWS Marketplace. Either as an AMI or SaaS offering. Of course, you can branch out to other paths as you grow.\n\nTypically you want to focus on getting as much funding as possible. Each partner paths comes with its own access to various funding programs - POC, MDF, Sandbox, etc. I'd suggest studying the official docs from partner central [here](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/guides).\n\nNormally, an AWS representative should've made introductions already. However, AWS went through some tough...restructuring exercises and people might be focused on something else. Also, per capita workload has increased tremendously in the past 2 years so there's a good chance you're going to fall through the cracks. If somebody does get through to you, play nice and make your offerings as clear as possible. They have KPIs and need your help to achieve them. If somebody doesn't introduce themselves in the next 7-10 days, reach out to support and ask for an introduction.\n\nIn our early days we were lucky enough to have somebody in AWS who pushed us - \"get to the next partnership tier\", \"get recognized through service delivery certifications and competencies\", \"get your GTM strategy in place\", etc. I hope you get somebody like that as well.\n\nIf you're struggling, feel free to DM me and we can have a chat.\n\nGood luck and enjoy it. It was definitely worth it for us.",

That's what opens up more opportunities for you and show you're somewhat serious. The main hurdle with that is getting AWS FTR certified, plus you'll need to maintain some ACE opportunity items in the partner network. They've updated the requirements since I went through it, so I can't give you exact details on that part.\n\nEven after you're validated, you need to get into another program called ISV Accelerate to be considered for co-sell. You'll also want your product on AWS Marketplace with proper AWS hosting.\n\n[https://aws.amazon.com/partners/foundational-technical-review/](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/foundational-technical-review/)\n\nIt's basically a series of mini-bosses you have to fight through. And honestly, opportunities don't just drop in your lap after all that. The co-sell motion is pretty bureaucratic and resource-intensive to even start understanding how it works. After you get to that point, the partner team will want to push you towards more specialized certifications relevant to your industry and what you're trying to do.",

Right now I'm only interested in the knowledge base part.\n\nIn this repo they use a lambda with an service role (aoss dashboard/API access all) against the index specified by arn.\n\nThis repo is 2yrs old so it's possible it's outdated. I was trying to make an index through a resource of type `AWS::Opensearch Serverless::Index` but I always get access denied.\n\nI don't think it's my AWS user/profile. I wonder if I need something like a role.\n\n[https://github.com/aws-samples/deploy-amazon-bedrock-agent-using-aws-sam](https://github.com/aws-samples/deploy-amazon-bedrock-agent-using-aws-sam)\n\nI think the answer is yes... because the index resource type mentioned above does try to create the index and results in the access denied error in the stack event logs.\n\nMy setup is almost the same as that repo with the exception of not using the `CreateOSSIndexForKnowledgebaseFunction` bit in the knowledgebase template. In the KB template they're using `AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource` resource type for their index.\n\n**Update**\n\nWhile it's not fully done I did get past the index creation problem. I had to put the account arn under principal AWS for the execution role, and I also added it to the data access policy. This is not necessarily the right way to do it.\n\n**Update 2**\n\nOkay so I didn't actually get this to work. If I put the root account under the data access policy list of principals, it could create the index. But then another problem arises where this index can't be found by the knowledgebase so idk, in the interest of moving forward I will manually create the index in the dashboard.\n\nWhat's funny is even using the AWS console with my account which has admin access to everything, it gets access denied lmao.\n\n  \nIt's weird I had to add my own user to the data access policy principal of the collection, which may make sense for the console but the stack index creation would work after this change. It's odd with the execution role defined at the top of the stack you'd think it uses that everywhere. That role is in the principal of the collection already when it's failing.",

Serverless OpenSearch indexes still need a principal with the right AOSS permissions, and CloudFormation executes with whatever role the stack is using. If that role isn’t explicitly allowed in the collection’s access policy, you’ll get access denied even if your user is admin.\n\nYou don’t strictly need Lambda, but you *do* need a role that’s trusted and mapped in the data access policy for the collection. The sample repo uses a custom resource because index creation used to be clunky and they wanted tighter control over timing and permissions. That pattern is still valid, just not the only way now.\n\nCheck two things: the stack execution role and the collection’s access policy. Make sure the role creating the index is listed as a principal with index-level permissions. Once that’s aligned, CloudFormation should be able to create the index without the Lambda workaround.",

Do I need to generate a .metadata.json for each of my thousands of documents?\n\nEdit: I should mention, I'm aware there are other options to handle this, I was just looking for something native to Bedrock to reduce extra ingestion pre-processing steps",
