Frontend Hosting \n\nThis is an alternative to Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare Pages for deploying SPAs and static websites of all types on AWS.\n\nIt’s based on the traditional method (S3 + Cloudfront) but includes additional features that are a bit harder to an SRE team to build out of the box (feature branch deploys, password protection, redirect management)\n\nI honestly think this is best way to handle frontend deployments on AWS so long as you set this up with IaC\n\n\\2. Backend SDK\n\nGen 1 was heavily opinionated, bound to its CLI, and had unclear boundaries with how interfaced with existing IaC. 90% of pain and strife associated to Amplify in general can be attributed here. \n\nGen 2 fixes many these issues and create clear separation of boundaries between your existing infra as it’s largely based on CDK. \n\nIf you are mostly running lambda backends or need to support older Next.js versions, I’d consider it safe to use\n\nThat said, amplify wouldn’t be my first choice.\n\nI strongly believe sticking to containers simplifies life for everyone, especially when ECS Express Mode or App Runner exist.",

IAM policy based access controls and full audit traceability is a great win in my space especially vs trusting backend code to correctly handle RBAC decision trees.

A few examples of why I find it problematic. \n\n\\* It doesn't have any real state management so if someone changes something outside cloudformation, it won't pick up that change when you run the stack, no warning just silently ignore unless it conflicts and the whole stack will fail.\n\n\\* It treats the whole stack as a single entity so it'll deploy all or nothing.  Some consider this a pro, most just find it annoying because say for example you mistype a security group id you're referencing.  Instead of refusing to create the resource that relies on that group so you can quickly fix it, you need to wait for it to rollback (remove all changes in that stack, get to a good state (UPDATE\\_ROLLBACK\\_COMPLETE) and then you can try again.  That means depending on your stack size, it could take over an hour to fix that simple problem.\n\n\\* It can be difficult to figure out what actually went wrong during stack creation and depending on the state it ends up in, can be difficult to fix and sometimes require you to delete the stack and redeploy.  Another fun feature is the first time you deploy a stack, if it errors out, you have to delete the stack manually.\n\n\\* Some strange behaviors that aren't well documented.  Example: when changing a db subnet group, you remove subnets 1234 and 5678 and add 1919.  It will add 1919 but fail to delete the other 2 even if nothing is using them.\n\nI'm sure others will give many more examples.",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am looking for guidance on how organizations design and manage AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) permission sets at scale.\n\n**Context**  \nOur AWS permission sets are mapped to AD/Okta groups. Some groups are team-based and have access to multiple AWS accounts. Team membership changes frequently, and we also have users who work across multiple teams.\n\nBecause access is granted at the group level, we often run into situations where access requested for one individual results in broader access for others in the same group who didn’t need or ask for it.\n\nWe also receive a high volume of access change requests. While we try to enforce least privilege, we’re struggling to balance that with operational overhead and permission set sprawl.\n\n**Discussion points**\n\n* How do you structure permission sets and groups to scale without constant rework?\n* Do you use team-based, job-based, or hybrid permission sets?\n* Do you create separate groups per account + team + job role, or use a different model?\n* Do you provide birthright access for engineers? If so:\n   * What does that access look like?\n   * Is it different in sandbox vs non-prod vs prod?\n* How do you determine what access a team actually needs, especially when users don’t know what permissions they require?\n* How do you manage temporary access to a permission set? Do you use cyberark sca?\n* Who approves access to permission set groups (manager, app owner, platform, security, etc.)?\n\nAny real-world patterns, lessons learned, or “what not to do” stories would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

It just is what it is.     \n  \nWe use set of enterprise-wide console roles that are used for most daily access needs, but also provide account-specific permission sets which engineering teams can use to fine-grain their access if it is needed over above the standard roles.\n\nWe had to build quite a bit of custom code to automate a lot of this (based on CloudTrail events coming in from identity store), but a few years in it's working pretty well.\n\nWe also use customer managed policy references heavily to build more granularity:  With some planning you can grant differing permissions using the same permission set, depending on the target (useful for environment tiers in our case).  \n\nBut it could be better.   The next big milestone is to slowly move to an ABAC model where feasible, which should (in theory) help cut down the number of permission sets needed. \n\nAnyway if you have any specific questions feel free to ask.

Define roles, determine what they need to do in what environments, create PermissionsSets for them then rolling them out.

Can read logs, manage Support tickets etc.\n* No write access.\n\nAdminSet\n\n* AD group is empty and only used through an audting temporary elevation process.\n* * Prod.\n\nPlatformAdmins\n\n* Gods. Like domain admins. \n* This is you, and you don't get involved in operations. :)\n\nThe same User can be in one or more of the above roles. e.g. Developers and Testers because they are performing those roles. If someone asks for a permission that's not included in the roles above then they are often asking to circumvent the operating model, either because the model is deficient, in which case it needs fixed, or they are just cowboys. (e.g. I want to get into UAT to clickops something because our testing isn't complete and product owner is all over me).\n\nOn defining privileges. YOu tailor it to allow them to get \"quality\" work done quickly. So developers can do a lot in the dev environment, but after that we want the model encourage the maturity of the CICD. So no clickops after Dev environment. It should all be driven by CICD with testing etc all automated.",

Reliability & Hallucination Prevention\nLLM + CLI (The Risk): When an LLM generates a CLI command, it is guessing the syntax based on its training data. If a flag has changed, or if the model \"hallucinates\" a parameter (e.g., inventing a --force-delete flag that doesn't exist), the command fails. You then have to paste the error back to the LLM to debug.  \nAWS MCP (The Solution): The MCP server exposes defined tools to the LLM. The LLM doesn't guess the command; it selects a tool from a list of valid options provided by the server. The MCP server then constructs the correct API call or CLI command under the hood, ensuring syntax accuracy.  \n2. Context Window Efficiency\nLLM + CLI: To get an LLM to understand your infrastructure via CLI, you often have to run aws ec2 describe-instances, copy the massive JSON output, and paste it into the chat. This eats up your context window rapidly with irrelevant noise.\nAWS MCP: MCP servers are \"context-aware.\" They can fetch only the relevant resources (resources) or summarize data before sending it to the LLM. This keeps the conversation focused and prevents the model from \"forgetting\" earlier instructions due to context overflow.  \n3. Security & Guardrails\nLLM + CLI: If you give an LLM access to a terminal (e.g., via a \"bash\" tool), it effectively has the permissions of your local user. It could accidentally delete resources or upload credentials if you aren't watching every character it types.\nAWS MCP:\nLeast Privilege: You can run the MCP server with a specific, restricted AWS profile or role, independent of your main local credentials.  \nSandboxing: MCP servers can verify the \"intent\" of a command before executing it.\nRead-Only Modes: Many MCP implementations allow you to set the server to \"read-only,\" meaning the LLM can look at your S3 buckets but physically cannot execute a delete or put command, regardless of what the prompt says.\n4. Structured Data vs. Text Parsing\nLLM + CLI: CLI output is text. The LLM has to parse whitespace, tables, or raw JSON text. Complex outputs (like CloudWatch logs or deeply nested JSON) are difficult for an LLM to read reliably without formatting errors.\nAWS MCP: The protocol allows the server to pass structured objects directly to the LLM. It acts like an API integration, meaning the LLM receives clean data structures (lists, dictionaries) rather than a wall of text it has to OCR/parse.\n5. Discovery & Up-to-Date Knowledge\nLLM + CLI: The LLM's knowledge of AWS CLI commands is cut off at its training date. It won't know about a new AWS service released last month.\nAWS MCP: The MCP server is a piece of software you update. If AWS releases a new feature and you update your MCP server, the LLM immediately has access to that \"tool\" and its documentation via the protocol, even if the model itself hasn't been retrained.",

I'm thinking about applying ABAC to simplify IAM setup in certain cases. For example, imagine that we have an account sandbox-bobaduk, where I have broad access for playing around. We also have an account secret-data where we store some dataset in an S3 bucket.\n\nWe use Google Workspace as our IDP, and I can apply tags to my role session based on attributes. For example, I authenticate as arn:aws:sts::$sandbox-bobaduk:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_MyRole_08759cec7ee3fdc9/bobaduk@org.org. Because I used sso to authenticate, I have the tag `team=data-guy` on my role session.\n\nI can write a resource policy for my s3 bucket that allows GetObject if the OrgId=myorg, and the team tag has the value \"data-guy\".\n\nSo far so good.\n\nMy question, which I'm struggling a little to answer is \"can I trust the provenance of that tag?\".\n\nMy thinking is that I can use an SCP that denies tagging a session with the \"team\" tag, unless the user is adopting a role matching \"AWSReservedSSO_*\". \n\nI should also have an SCP that prevents a user from creating a new role or user with that tag.\n\nthe AWSReservedSSO_* roles can only be created by identity centre, and the trust policy restricts their use to identity centre, so with those SCPs in place, am I missing anything? \n\nI don't need transitive tagging for role chaining, because these tags are _only_ used for this kind of cross-account access based on a resource policy. if I assume another role, I should only have the permissions granted explicitly to that role.",

      "text": "A few days ago I posted a benchmark here showing Llama 3.2 (3B, Int4) running on Lambda with sub-500ms cold starts. The reaction was skeptical, with many folks sharing their own 10s+ spin-up times for similar workloads.\n\nI wanted to share the specific architecture and configuration that made that benchmark possible. It wasn't a private feature; it was about exploiting how Lambda allocates resources.\n\nHere is the TL;DR of the setup:\n\n**1. The 10GB Memory \"Hack\" is for vCPUs, not RAM.** This is the most critical part. A 3GB model doesn't need 10GB of RAM, but in Lambda, you can't get CPU without memory. At 1,769 MB, you only get 1 vCPU.\n\n* To get the **6 vCPUs** needed to saturate thread pools for parallel model deserialization (e.g., with PyTorch/ONNX Runtime), you need to provision **\\~10GB of memory**.\n* The higher memory also comes with more memory bandwidth, which helps immensely.\n* **Counter-intuitively, this can be cheaper.** The function runs so much faster that the total cost per invocation is often lower than a 4GB function that runs for 5x longer.\n\n**2. Defeating the \"Import Tax\" with Container Streaming.** Standard Python imports like `import torch` are slow. I used Lambda's **container image streaming**. By structuring the Dockerfile so the model weights are in the lower layers, Lambda starts streaming the data *before* the runtime fully initializes, effectively paralleling the two biggest bottlenecks.\n\n**The Results (from my lab):**\n\n* **Vanilla Python (S3 pull):** \\~8s cold start. Unusable.\n* **Optimized Python (10GB + Streaming):** \\~480ms cold start. This was the Reddit post.\n* **Rust + ONNX Runtime:** \\~380ms cold start. The fastest, but highest engineering effort.\n\nI wrote up a full deep dive with the Terraform code, a more detailed benchmark breakdown, and a decision matrix on when *not* to use this approach (e.g., high, steady QPS).\n\n[**https://www.rack2cloud.com/lambda-cold-start-optimization-llama-3-2-benchmark/**](https://www.rack2cloud.com/lambda-cold-start-optimization-llama-3-2-benchmark/)\n\nI'm curious if others have played with high-memory Lambdas specifically for the CPU benefits on CPU-bound init tasks. Is the trade-off worth it for your use cases?",

Since that much memory/vCPU was overkill for the rest of the app, we ended up having to have two Lambdas with different memory configs that effectively ran the same code, with the smaller REST API Lambda calling the bigger image processing Lambda as needed. It generally worked, but was more of a headache than one would think at first glance.\n\n\nStill, interesting you managed to make this work in Lambda so effectively. I've played around with running small LLMs in Lambda with some success, so adding some of the details you mentioned might make a big difference.",

If you ran your lightweight REST API handler on that 10GB instance, you’d be burning significant budget on idle vCPUs just waiting for network I/O. By decoupling them, you aligned the resource profiles to the actual work being done. It hurts to manage, but it's the correct design pattern for cost and performance.\n\nDefinitely give the container streaming setup a shot for your LLM experiments. The high vCPU count *really* shines when it can parallelize the layer download and the model deserialization simultaneously. Please let us know if you see similar gains.",

ECS Anywhere still treats a cluster as a shared scheduling and control boundary, so putting all locations into one cluster makes it much easier for something to accidentally cross a boundary you do not want crossed. Even if you add constraints, you are fighting the model a bit.\n\nOne cluster per site keeps failure domains clean and matches how your redundancy is designed. It also makes it easier to reason about capacity, deployments, and outages when something goes wrong at a single location. The tradeoff is more clusters to manage, but that tends to be an operational problem you can automate, while cross location blast radius is harder to undo later.",

What actually hurts is the constant context switching while trying to understand how a system fits together, what depends on what, and what changed recently.\n\nAs systems grow, this feels like it gets exponentially harder. Add logs and now you’ve created a million new events to dig through.. Add another database and suddenly you’re dealing with subnet constraints or a DB choice that’s expensive as hell, and no one noticed until later. Everyone knows their slice, but the full picture lives nowhere, so bit rot just keeps creeping in.\n\nThis feels even worse now that AI agents are pushing a ton of slop ..i mean code and config changes quickly. Things are moving at lightspeed, I cant be the only one feeling like my understanding is falling behind daily.\n\nI’m honestly stuck on how people handle this well in practice. For folks dealing with real production systems, what’s actually helped? Diagrams, docs, tribal knowledge, tooling, something else? ",

In reality that doesn't really work out very often, but what you can do is apply the same rules as you'd do in namespaces/modules/packages/boundaries, things that only matter very close to the technical 'thing' and don't spill over into other areas (outside of its own boundary) would be in your commit message, code comments, or repository docs for example.

Then only you can fail the pipeline when the code does not hit a particular baseline you set, let it be Code Quality (Sonarqube), SAST / DAST etc.\n\nNow, having said that,  I have implemented the other way also, like a Central Pipeline. The way I did is, all the fields are parametrized with fields for example Application ID for that particular application in our scan tool, Packaged Artifact URL for doing Opensource Library Scan, GIT Repo URL for downloading source for SAST ,  Branch to name a few (it has been 5 years so I dont remember most)\n\nThen the application build pipeline will trigger the scanning Job by calling REST API of CI/CD tool with above parameters filled in. Things like Artifact URL, GIT Repo URL etc would be already available as environment variables. But application ID for Scanning tool, i had to set it manually as a parameter for each pipeline (Devs will fill it, and I just had to give the template)\n\nAPI key for your Scanning tool would be most probably global key. This key can be stored as a variable in the central pipeline itself\n\nI have scaled both the above models for 1000+ pipelines. Works well, but I strongly suggest you to keep these scans and Quality gates as part of the actual build pipeline itself. It can go in parallel with rest of the stages not affecting deployment times. Because at some point, you would want to break the pipelines when code quality goes south.",

If we do create one it is up to us to make sure it works for everyone which is a burden we rather not take on. \n\nSo we decided to decouple enforcement from scanning. In github we can create rulesets that require certain scanning tools to have checked the repository before a PR can be merged. We use this for enforcement while providing pipeline templates and private github actions to help implementation of scanning tools. \n\nThis makes it easier to start enforcement while not being a burden because teams can do their own implementation if ours don’t work. \n\nFor scanning tools that dont integrate with github rulesets checks we have created our own tool to check if the scanning is sufficient.",

Because upon research it seems like everybody hates it and no one actually uses it in this great year of 2026. I've encountered it before, but that's when I was playing around AWS, not production.\n\nI've heard of CDK, might lean into this compared to SAM.\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qg79f4)",

The result is the same - the console, CF, and terraform, all use the same APIs.\n\nIf you want control, you have to do just as much work to do to prevent console meddling.\n\nDrift detection? TF can do that. State? You can put the state in an S3 bucket with strong controls on it.\n\nAll the attitudes preferring CloudFormation to Terraform I've seen ... seem to be rooted in dislike for the idea of programming. The only advantages CF has over TF in my book are that you have a prebuilt IaC setup, and lots of code samples. The rest ... CF is hard to grow, hard to refactor, and a PITA to modularize. And slow, because dependency graphs in CF treat stacks as an entire atomic unit, you can't update anything with an input that depends on an output until the whole stack is done.",

You can \"learn\" tf, then move to another company and have no idea what TF is going on. There are more escape hatches in tf that it can be baffling how it even got a name for itself as iac. There is some real shit out there. It's like the little tikes learning kit for iac. In some ways it's the new perl vs python argument of \"there's more than one way to do it\" in perl vs \"there's only one way to do it\" in Python. Which I guess means in some ways it's a derivation of the (big|little) endiness argument.\n\nThe nicer thing about cf is that it's a bit more predictable (outside of using custom resources, etc) and as long as you're not naming things you can pick it up and deploy it in a similar account for dev or stage, etc. it's concept of \"state\" is the not defined by some file you need to keep track of, it's state is it and it's resources existence. It's also not as clever or fearureful as tf, which when you manage huge amounts of resources in huge amounts of stacks across huge amounts of accounts across modest amounts of departments can be a very very nice thing because you can still fit the concept in your head.
