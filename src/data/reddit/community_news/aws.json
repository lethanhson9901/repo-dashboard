      "text": "This is the follow-up to my account suspension post from 2 days ago that got 164K views.\n\nEric G from AWS Executive Escalations sent my documents to Trust & Safety for review. That was his last message. It's been 2 days of complete silence since then.\n\nNo response on the support portal. No response from the multiple AWS support reps who were tagged here and on LinkedIn. Nothing. Just silence while my startup sits completely offline.\n\nWe made the decision yesterday to migrate everything to GCP. We can't wait any longer. Every day of silence costs us thousands in lost revenue and damages customer relationships we spent months building. Our business needs to function.\n\nWhat's wild is that even with 164K people seeing this, even with Executive Escalations directly involved, even with multiple support reps across every channel saying they escalated it - AWS just went silent. No updates, no timeline, no communication at all.\n\nThe community response here was incredible. People reached out, offered advice, tagged AWS employees, shared their own stories. Thank you to everyone who tried to help. It meant a lot even though AWS never showed up.\n\nCase 176984120700770 if AWS ever decides to respond. But we've moved on.\n\nTo anyone else building on AWS, have a backup plan. Because this can happen to you too, and 164K views apparently isn't enough to get a response.",

We see a lot of these nightmare scenarios posted here, but whenever I've been able to dig deeper, there are legitimate reasons that OP doesn't share about what flagged their account in the first place. The idea it's been escalated so much according to them and they are still suspended is just another clue that there is more to the story.",

      "text": "I keep seeing the same questions about AWS credits, and most of the answers are either outdated or vague. We went through this ourselves last year when building on AWS. So here’s what actually works as of February 2026\n\nNo affliate links, no fluff. Just what’s currently real and worked for us.\n\n\n\n**1. The fintech route - $5K in about 15 minutes**\n\nMost people overlook this one. A few startup banking platforms are official AWS Activate Providers, which means their customers can apply for AWS credits directly through them. Sometimes you will get notified from them if you are eligable.\n\nWe used Brex, but the same logic applies to other fintechs offering benefit. Once your business account is set up, you can apply through the AWS Activate Portfolio tier using the provider’s organization ID (you’ll find it inside their perks or startup programs section).\n\nA few important details:\n\n\\- Your AWS Accouunt should list your fintechs card as default payment method before applying.\n\n\\- The Company needs to be under 10 years old and must not have already received more than $5K in Activate Credits.\n\n\\- Credits usually land in about a week and expire after 12 months.\n\n\\- Your support plan needs be Business Support+. \n\n\n\n**2. AWS Activate Founders - $1K, open to almost anyone**\n\nGot to [https://aws.amazon.com/startups](https://aws.amazon.com/startups) and apply for the Founders tier.\n\nRequirements:\n\n\\- Company founded within the last 10 years\n\n\\- Pre-series B\n\n\\- AWS Account on a paid plan\n\n\\- Real company website (not a placeholder)\n\n\n\nTwo common mistakes:\n\n\\- Don’t use a Gmail or Yahoo adress, use your company domain instead.\n\n\\- Make sure your website hast actual content. Empty sites often get auto-rejected\n\n\n\n**3. AWS Activate Portfolio - $25K to $100K**\n\nIf you are backed by a VC or went through an accelerator, ask them. Most investors are AWS Activate Providers but never proactively mention it.\n\n\n\n**4. The Free Tier changed in mid-2025**\n\nNew Accounts after July 15, 2025 get $100 in credits automatically, plus another $100 unlocked by using core services (e.g. EC2, Lambda, Budgets).\n\n\n\n**5. Accelerator programs - $100K+ if you get in**\n\nY Combinator gives $100K standard and up to $500K for AI startups.\n\nEven YC’s Startup School (free, online, open to anyone) includes $2.5K in AWS credits.\n\n\n\n**6. Nonprofits and researchers - $1K to $5K**\n\nRegistered nonprofits can get $1K - $5K per year through TechSoup’s AWS program.\n\n\n\n**What doesn’t work!**\n\n\\- Buying credits from „brokers“, violates AWS ToS.\n\n\\- Creating multiple accounts to stack Founders credits, AWS tracks at the company level\n\n\\- Using personal AWS account and later converting it to business, just start fresh with a business account.\n\n\\- waiting too long after funding round, the 12-month Portfolio window is hard-coded.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nFastest route if you’re an early-stage startup:\n\n1. Open a fintech business account (Brex or Mercury both work)\n\n2. Apply through their AWS Activate partnership -> $5K in credits.\n\n3. Apply for Founders ($1K) seperately.\n\n4. If you have investors, ask for their Activate org ID -> $25K - $100K.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions. We’ve gone through most of these paths ourselves.",

          "text": "Solid breakdown. One thing worth adding -- the Business Support plan requirement for the fintech route is a hidden cost people miss. That's $100/month minimum, so factor that into the $5K credit math. Still net positive obviously, but I've seen people surprised by the support plan charge eating into their credits.\n\n  \nAlso for anyone reading this in a non-US context: the fintech route through Brex/Mercury only works if you have a US-incorporated entity. For international startups, the Activate Founders tier is usually the first real option.\n\n  \nOne more gotcha on the Portfolio tier -- some VCs have already used up their Activate allocations for the quarter and won't tell you. If your investor says they're an Activate Provider but the application gets rejected, ask them to check their remaining allocation. They get a fixed number of referrals per period.\n\n  \nThe personal vs business account advice is critical. Starting fresh with a business account from day one saves weeks of back-and-forth with support trying to convert later.",

      "text": "Hello, my team has been using Bedrock since its infancy and we're a platinum tier Amazon partner. Here are my suggestions for Bedrock:\n\n\\* Add a new **embedding model**. Titan v2 is ok, but its 2 years old. Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B is much better at 1024 dimensions. There are many open source models that excel at 512 dimensions also. We're using EC2 (or really ECS with EC2) to host them locally, but having them in Bedrock at a reasonable price would make things easier to maintain.\n\n\\* Add some inexpensive and easy to use **reranker** models that are open source. Cohere is just too expensive... we've been hosting some models on EC2, but we'd rather use Bedrock for jina-reranker-v3 / mxbai-rerank-large-v1 / bge-reranker-v2-m3 / qwen3-reranker-0.6B. \n\n\\* You're fast to add Anthropic models, which we really appreciate. But can you add other open source LLMs that you started investing into already? Where is **DeepSeek v3.2**? Where is **Kimi K2.5**? **MiniMax 2.1**? It feels like a lot of models you host are slightly outdated.\n\n\\* I don't know if anyone is using your **Nova models**. We've benchmarked them, and for the price/performance they always fall short. Sorry... If they were 2x cheaper, we would probably use them in some places.\n\nThis is my team's feedback on AWS Bedrock. I'm curious what other people think about Bedrock and where its lacking.",

Titan v2 was fine when it launched but the open source space has moved so far ahead that hosting your own on ECS starts making more sense, which kind of defeats the purpose of a managed service. Same story with rerankers, Cohere pricing just doesn't work if you're doing any serious volume of reranking. Would love to see them add jina-reranker-v3 or even the smaller qwen models as first-class Bedrock options.",

      "text": "My app allows users to do a bulk import of many products. When the user triggers a bulk import, each product will get enqueued to the sqs queue as a message. There is a lambda worker that will process from the queue. The problem is that in order to import the product I need to call a third party API which is rate limited (using a fixed window, e.g. 5000 api calls per day). Since there could be multiple users that trigger a bulk import at the same time, I was planning to use SQS \"fair\" queues to avoid the noisy neighbor problem.\n\nMy original idea was to create an internal rate limiter that would allow the lambda to process X amount of messages per minute. For example, 3 messages per minute. Once the limit per minute is reached, I was planning to use changeMessageVisibility() for any other messages it picks up until the next one-minute window begins. So for example, if there are 30 seconds left until the next minute window starts, I would make the message invisible for 30 seconds. But I realize now that if some messages are \"unlucky\" and keep getting changeMessageVisibility() called on them, then the receive count will increase and eventually they will be added to the dead letter queue. And for bulk imports, the queue will be quite full, so the lambda would be picking up messages continuously for a period of time.\n\nI'm aware we can use \"maximum concurrency\" on the SQS side and \"reserved concurrency\" on the lambda side, but this doesn't give me the granularity of control on the rate of processing that I am seeking.",

This is how we'll support a rolling daily rate limit check.  If you have a hard daily limit that rolls over at x time daily, just switch this to a single daily row.\n\nSenders -> Inbox SQS\n\nLambda A on cron such as \"rate(5 minutes)\": Reads all items from DynamoDB newer than 24 hours ago and sums the counts.  If the count is lower than your daily limit, take the difference and pull that many messages off the Inbox SQS and send them to the Outbox SQS for processing.  Update the current hour item count with however many more you've sent to Outbox making sure to set the TTL to 24 hours in the future for cleanup.  If you've reached your limit, just exit and try again next rate(5 minutes) or whatever.  Since each hour is an item and they are TTL set to auto-expire after 24 hours, DynamoDB will handle the cleanup of your old counts. -Expirations can take a while, even if they are usually quick, so don't rely on them for the scan() to only pull the latest 24...but the count is low enough a scan() + filter is very cheap here.\n\nLambda B subscribes to Outbox SQS: This is the setup you have now, just processes as fast as it can and doesn't care about limits because the first half of this already manages the rate limit into this SQS.\n\nThis Inbox/Outbox model gives you complete control on your processing rate for 3rd party calls while still allowing clients to burst without worry.  Add DLQ to everything of course, monitoring, etc, but that's the basic framework.\n\nThere's other ways to do this you might consider, such as manually handling exponential backoff + jitter and retry patterns using a 3 queue model and metadata in the message attributes, but if we're strictly talking about honoring 3rd party rate limits the above inbox/outbox pattern has worked well for me and doesn't waste costly CPU/memory cycles on sleep() calls.",

It requires two queues.\n\nQueue #1 is your existing queue where all the work is dumped into, irrespective of quota limits.\n\nYou then have a Lambda that is scheduled periodically (say, every 1-15 minutes), and reads messages from Queue #1. This Lambda knows about the rate limit, and only puts a number of messages into Queue #2 that can be handled within the schedule period. But here is the trick: Every time a message is inserted into Queue #2, it configures a DelaySeconds in the \"release\" of the message: This is an SQS SendMessage parameter that ensure messages are not becoming visible immediately, but only after a while. Obviously you ensure that the DelaySeconds is spread evenly over the schedule period.\n\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API\\_SendMessage.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessage.html) \\- see the DelaySeconds attribute. Note that this can have a maximum of 15 minutes, so you need to schedule the Lambda above at least every 15 minutes.\n\nThe last bit is the Lambda that reads Queue #2 and invokes the 3rd party API call. Due to the way the messages are released from Queue #1, you don't have to worry about rate limits anymore in this Lambda.",

We've been a partner since 2022 and I know how overwhelming things might seem.\n\nYou first need to decide which path you want to take - [see here](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/paths/). As a VoIP solutions provider, it seems the software path might be the one to start with. i.e: build your solution on top of AWS and distribute it to customers through AWS Marketplace. Either as an AMI or SaaS offering. Of course, you can branch out to other paths as you grow.\n\nTypically you want to focus on getting as much funding as possible. Each partner paths comes with its own access to various funding programs - POC, MDF, Sandbox, etc. I'd suggest studying the official docs from partner central [here](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/guides).\n\nNormally, an AWS representative should've made introductions already. However, AWS went through some tough...restructuring exercises and people might be focused on something else. Also, per capita workload has increased tremendously in the past 2 years so there's a good chance you're going to fall through the cracks. If somebody does get through to you, play nice and make your offerings as clear as possible. They have KPIs and need your help to achieve them. If somebody doesn't introduce themselves in the next 7-10 days, reach out to support and ask for an introduction.\n\nIn our early days we were lucky enough to have somebody in AWS who pushed us - \"get to the next partnership tier\", \"get recognized through service delivery certifications and competencies\", \"get your GTM strategy in place\", etc. I hope you get somebody like that as well.\n\nIf you're struggling, feel free to DM me and we can have a chat.\n\nGood luck and enjoy it. It was definitely worth it for us.",

That's what opens up more opportunities for you and show you're somewhat serious. The main hurdle with that is getting AWS FTR certified, plus you'll need to maintain some ACE opportunity items in the partner network. They've updated the requirements since I went through it, so I can't give you exact details on that part.\n\nEven after you're validated, you need to get into another program called ISV Accelerate to be considered for co-sell. You'll also want your product on AWS Marketplace with proper AWS hosting.\n\n[https://aws.amazon.com/partners/foundational-technical-review/](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/foundational-technical-review/)\n\nIt's basically a series of mini-bosses you have to fight through. And honestly, opportunities don't just drop in your lap after all that. The co-sell motion is pretty bureaucratic and resource-intensive to even start understanding how it works. After you get to that point, the partner team will want to push you towards more specialized certifications relevant to your industry and what you're trying to do.",

In practice we saw maybe 1-2% write latency increase on the primary, which is basically noise. The bigger gotcha is replication lag to the secondary region, which is typically under a second but can spike during heavy write bursts. Make sure you understand what that means for your RPO targets. The other thing that catches people is failover time. Aurora Global Database failover isn't instant, you're looking at around 1-2 minutes for a managed planned failover and potentially longer for unplanned. If your DR requirements need sub-30-second failover you might want to look at Aurora Global Database with write forwarding or a multi-region active-active pattern instead. Also test your failover runbook regularly, the number of teams that set up Global Database for DR and never actually test a failover is way too high.",

          "text": "Having been someone who has made these calls before (as the final decision maker) - multi-cloud hybrids make no sense financially, resiliency-wise, and operationally. If you're going to use Azure, AWS, or GCP - stick to one.\n\nI am skeptical if you are truly calculating lower-costs. Usually:\n\n1. The cost analysis underestimates running Engineering costs required for oncall, maintenance and support. Most teams struggle with distributed systems. Observability of systems across clouds and 3P vendors becomes much more complex and painful.\n2. Temporary discounts provided by the 2nd cloud provider are erroneously factored in. You're making a long-term decision that costs significant money to unwind. Naiive business/tech leaders factor in the discounted run-rate which is a fundamental mistake.\n3. Data-transfer costs (realized and opportunity costs). Cloud providers often eat the costs of intra-network data transfer because its folded into the cost of setting up and maintaining compute. They are forced to charge some degree of ingress/egress costs because that is a cost born from another party (namely ISPs). The data-costs add up in both dollars and time (the amount of data that can move between compute nodes is several times greater than traversing the public internet).\n\nFor most businesses - going back to a hybrid on-prem is a wiser business and architectural decision for the same CapEX and OpEX you would need to operate a hybrid cloud. If you're trying to avoid vendor lock-in, going into a hybrid on-prem solution is a better architectural choice.\n\n* You will be forced to modularize your systems in a way that can be executed either on-prem or in-cloud.\n* You'll select vendors that have built solutions that keep you in the drivers-seat with how you use them. You'll find yourself \"owning\" what you purchase instead of \"renting it\" - meaning that you'll start to really assess the cost/value of holding a subscription.\n* You'll be intentional with your data-sovereignty ; leading to less headaches and less likely you get hit with the regulatory schtick which is due to whack a few folks in the upcoming years as the world starts to decouple with the American cloud providers.\n\nOnboarding a second cloud does not structurally reduce your running costs - it increases it. If you're going to increase it - its better to achieve real vendor independence.",

Traffic is never routed to the empty AZ. Everything works.\n   * If we terminate all instances from the first AZ (1a) with AWS FIS, the DNS assigned from this AZ was also removed, so we have only one DNS remaining.\n2. **New NLB (Created Feb 2026):**\n   * **Configuration:** Identical to the old one (Terraform/OpenTofu code is the same).\n   * **Behavior:** The NLB **continues to publish the IP** of the empty AZ in the DNS record.\n   * **Result:** `dig` returns 3 IPs. Client traffic is round-robined to the empty AZ (\\~33% of requests). Since Cross-Zone is disabled and there are no local targets, these packets are blackholed, causing immediate connection timeouts/failures.\n\n**Support's Response:** I opened a ticket, and AWS Support claims *\"*After reviewing your case and consulting with our internal resources, I can confirm that \\*\\*this is the expected behavior for Network Load Balancers\\*\\*, and there has been no recent change to how NLBs handle DNS resolution for AZs with no registered targets*.\"*\n\nHowever, the empirical evidence (side-by-side `dig` results on same-region, same-config LBs) suggests otherwise.\n\n**The Impact:** This feels like a silent breaking change. Previously, we relied on the NLB's ability to \"drain\" an AZ from DNS if the backend was dead (fail-open style). Now, it seems new NLBs are \"sticky\" to their AZs regardless of backend health, which breaks standard DR/Failover patterns where you might spin down an AZ to save costs or during an outage.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Has anyone else noticed this shift in \"Fail Open\" behavior on recent NLBs?\n* Is there a new attribute (hidden or documented) that controls this \"DNS draining\" behavior?\n* Is the only solution now to force Cross-Zone Load Balancing (and pay the transfer costs) or manually manipulate Subnet mappings during an incident?\n\nThanks for any insights.",

No AWS-managed site-to-site VPN, no self-hosted site-to-site VPN, no TGW, no VPC peering, nothing.\n\nThe reason is that if you have independent customers, then each of these customers manages its own IP plan, and sooner or later these plans are going to come into conflict with each other. Then you need to add band-aids like two-way NAT or other types of translation. That's a rabbit hole you really don't want to get close to.\n\nAnd even if you don't get into overlapping IP space problems, there's still security to consider: You are essentially opening up their network to everyone who is connected to a different company. Sure, you can then try to lock things down with firewalls and whatnot, but it's better not to start out with that gaping security hole in the first place.\n\nIf you are trying to connect independent customers together, then either implement things as if it comes from the public internet: DMZs, Reverse Proxies, API Gateways, Bastion Hosts and other tried and tested technology, which minimises and formalises the \"interface\". Or interface your customers directly at layer-7. AWS has tools like PrivateLink and VPC Lattice for that.",

B has two subnets, let's call them subnet-B1 and subnet-B2, and each has its own route table rtb-B1 and rtb-B2.\n\nIn the route table for vpc-A's traffic, I point an IP range I want to route though vpc-B (let's say 10.0.3.0/24 as an example) towards the peering connection pcx-AB. Then, in rtb-B1 I set 10.0.3.0/24 to a correctly configured service (living in another VPC, the Internet, doesn't matter) that dumps incoming traffic to a log, but in rtb-B2 I set 10.0.3.0/24 to a NAT gateway living within subnet-B1.\n\nWhat is going to happen? Am I going to see packets from 10.0.1.0/24 in the log, along with connection errors because the destination doesn't know where vpc-A is? Or are they going to come from 10.0.2.0/24, network translated through the NAT in subnet-B1? Or am I going to see a mix of both?\n\nEssentially: when traffic arrives to a VPC with multiple route tables through a peering connection, which table's routes does it prioritise?\n\nHere's a shitty drawing of the situation:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o4ozyrjiy4hg1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d568bd211d5403c140da0a682a491ea82238aad\n\n",

While I didn't pay for anything, if you need more hands-on, SkillBuilder has some subscription based sessions too\nhttps://skillbuilder.aws/category/exam-prep/advanced-networking-specialty-ANS-C01\n\n\nAWS Academy is another option.\n\n\nThere are many 3rd party trainings too, like TutorialsDojo. I haven't used them myself but some people said they were helpful.",
