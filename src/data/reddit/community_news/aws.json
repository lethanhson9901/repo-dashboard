Backend SDK\n\nGen 1 was heavily opinionated, bound to its CLI, and had unclear boundaries with how interfaced with existing IaC. 90% of pain and strife associated to Amplify in general can be attributed here. \n\nGen 2 fixes many these issues and create clear separation of boundaries between your existing infra as it’s largely based on CDK. \n\nIf you are mostly running lambda backends or need to support older Next.js versions, I’d consider it safe to use\n\nThat said, amplify wouldn’t be my first choice.\n\nI strongly believe sticking to containers simplifies life for everyone, especially when ECS Express Mode or App Runner exist.",

I work in corporate space mostly, not end user, so for me it's much more about hooking auth into ALBs, API Gateway, etc and linking that into Okta or Identity Center.\n\nGetting actual IAM credentials via Identity Pools on per-user basis is also a *HUGE* win architecturally for me as I can then use IAM directly to auth users by policy to API Gateway or direct writes to dynamodb, etc from the browser.  IAM policy based access controls and full audit traceability is a great win in my space especially vs trusting backend code to correctly handle RBAC decision trees.  My API code then only has to care about its actual task knowing the security is handled upstream.",

A few examples of why I find it problematic. \n\n\\* It doesn't have any real state management so if someone changes something outside cloudformation, it won't pick up that change when you run the stack, no warning just silently ignore unless it conflicts and the whole stack will fail.\n\n\\* It treats the whole stack as a single entity so it'll deploy all or nothing.  Some consider this a pro, most just find it annoying because say for example you mistype a security group id you're referencing.  Instead of refusing to create the resource that relies on that group so you can quickly fix it, you need to wait for it to rollback (remove all changes in that stack, get to a good state (UPDATE\\_ROLLBACK\\_COMPLETE) and then you can try again.  That means depending on your stack size, it could take over an hour to fix that simple problem.\n\n\\* It can be difficult to figure out what actually went wrong during stack creation and depending on the state it ends up in, can be difficult to fix and sometimes require you to delete the stack and redeploy.  Another fun feature is the first time you deploy a stack, if it errors out, you have to delete the stack manually.\n\n\\* Some strange behaviors that aren't well documented.  Example: when changing a db subnet group, you remove subnets 1234 and 5678 and add 1919.  It will add 1919 but fail to delete the other 2 even if nothing is using them.\n\nI'm sure others will give many more examples.",

Cloudflare, etc.  Amazon's ability to guarantee a DNS control plane failover in under an hour is unique and a step up above anyone else.   Remember, this isn't a region redundancy, R53 is any cast globally.  This is so if the R53 control plane has issues, you can fail over to a secondary control plane of R53.",

Focused on reliability and developer experience, I put together a construct library where services have cost-savings, reliability, security, and scalability baked in from the start.\n\nThis is where I want to introduce a phrase I'm calling Infrastructure as Software. The idea is that these constructs, with minimal input, can be stitched together to build fault-tolerant systems. I built this site as a forcing function to showcase what I've been working on, but more importantly it's how an SRE approaches building self-healing infrastructure.\n\nThere's still more to this project, but for now I want to introduce the philosophy of Infrastructure as Software as I continue to illustrate how these constructs work together to build autonomous systems.\n\nWould love to get the community’s input. \n\n[https://github.com/crmagz/cdk-constructs-library](https://github.com/crmagz/cdk-constructs-library)\n\n[https://thepractitioner.cloud/blog/infrastructure-as-software](https://thepractitioner.cloud/blog/infrastructure-as-software)\n\n[https://thepractitioner.cloud/guides/infrastructure-as-software/introduction](https://thepractitioner.cloud/guides/infrastructure-as-software/introduction)\n\n",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am looking for guidance on how organizations design and manage AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) permission sets at scale.\n\n**Context**  \nOur AWS permission sets are mapped to AD/Okta groups. Some groups are team-based and have access to multiple AWS accounts. Team membership changes frequently, and we also have users who work across multiple teams.\n\nBecause access is granted at the group level, we often run into situations where access requested for one individual results in broader access for others in the same group who didn’t need or ask for it.\n\nWe also receive a high volume of access change requests. While we try to enforce least privilege, we’re struggling to balance that with operational overhead and permission set sprawl.\n\n**Discussion points**\n\n* How do you structure permission sets and groups to scale without constant rework?\n* Do you use team-based, job-based, or hybrid permission sets?\n* Do you create separate groups per account + team + job role, or use a different model?\n* Do you provide birthright access for engineers? If so:\n   * What does that access look like?\n   * Is it different in sandbox vs non-prod vs prod?\n* How do you determine what access a team actually needs, especially when users don’t know what permissions they require?\n* How do you manage temporary access to a permission set? Do you use cyberark sca?\n* Who approves access to permission set groups (manager, app owner, platform, security, etc.)?\n\nAny real-world patterns, lessons learned, or “what not to do” stories would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

It just is what it is.     \n  \nWe use set of enterprise-wide console roles that are used for most daily access needs, but also provide account-specific permission sets which engineering teams can use to fine-grain their access if it is needed over above the standard roles.\n\nWe had to build quite a bit of custom code to automate a lot of this (based on CloudTrail events coming in from identity store), but a few years in it's working pretty well.\n\nWe also use customer managed policy references heavily to build more granularity:  With some planning you can grant differing permissions using the same permission set, depending on the target (useful for environment tiers in our case).  \n\nBut it could be better.   The next big milestone is to slowly move to an ABAC model where feasible, which should (in theory) help cut down the number of permission sets needed. \n\nAnyway if you have any specific questions feel free to ask.  I'll try to answer best I can.",

Define roles, determine what they need to do in what environments, create PermissionsSets for them then rolling them out.

Can read logs, manage Support tickets etc.\n* No write access.\n\nAdminSet\n\n* AD group is empty and only used through an audting temporary elevation process.\n* * Prod.\n\nPlatformAdmins\n\n* Gods. Like domain admins. \n* This is you, and you don't get involved in operations. :)\n\nThe same User can be in one or more of the above roles. e.g. Developers and Testers because they are performing those roles. If someone asks for a permission that's not included in the roles above then they are often asking to circumvent the operating model, either because the model is deficient, in which case it needs fixed, or they are just cowboys. (e.g. I want to get into UAT to clickops something because our testing isn't complete and product owner is all over me).\n\nOn defining privileges. YOu tailor it to allow them to get \"quality\" work done quickly. So developers can do a lot in the dev environment, but after that we want the model encourage the maturity of the CICD. So no clickops after Dev environment. It should all be driven by CICD with testing etc all automated.",

Load balancers increase latency, especially if they are L7 (ALB) or add TLS.\n\nIf you don’t, I would recommend adding distributed tracing and per-route latency / throughput metrics would be helpful. OpenTelemetry is great. If you don’t want to pay, the OpenTelemetry collector has auto-instrumentation using ebpf, and yes you can setup the collector along with your service in Fargate.\n\nhttps://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/obi/",

If you don't need the logs, delete them, don't just automatically downgrade their retention.  Getting the app owners to state plainly and simply what their needs are (and the business why) lets you bucket the log SLA sanely.\n\nIt's better to have a flowchart than a one size fits all rule IMO.",

A common pattern is minimal retention in CloudWatch for operational debugging, then streaming everything to S3 as cheaply as possible and doing search only when needed.\n\nKinesis Firehose to S3 with compression and partitioning is usually the simplest and cheapest long term option. Athena on top of S3 for ad hoc queries beats keeping logs hot in a metrics system. Grafana is fine as a front end, but the real cost savings come from pushing cold data to S3 quickly and being disciplined about retention and sampling.",

ECS Anywhere still treats a cluster as a shared scheduling and control boundary, so putting all locations into one cluster makes it much easier for something to accidentally cross a boundary you do not want crossed.

It also makes it easier to reason about capacity, deployments, and outages when something goes wrong at a single location. The tradeoff is more clusters to manage, but that tends to be an operational problem you can automate, while cross location blast radius is harder to undo later.",

I did not purchase their 1-on-1 coaching, or bother with AI Story analysis, but those are products they offer.\n\nThey also have a very-informative [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@amazoninterviewwhizzdayone503) channel with a ton of good content on it, and have a free live Q&A every Monday. (Their YouTube channel is horribly-named, but it's good stuff.)\n\nFor my LP's, I think I had about 45 pages of typed-up stories. (I didn't actually need to refer to my notes during my interview, but I did have a quick-reference-table that I used several times just to remind me of what was in my list of stories.) And I'm sure you know this, but you want to avoid re-using the same story more than once if you can at-all help it.\n\nThe one question that almost got me rejected during phone screen was \"What would you have done better if you had to do it all over again?\" in reference to the flagship project on my CV. That one kind of startled me, because it was in regards to a project I did that was a complete success; innovative, on-time, on-budget, profitable, and repeatable for other customers.",

With Aurora, you'd have massive fulltext indexes, slow/unpredictable index rebuilds, and performance is likely to bog down quickly under concurrent fuzzy searches.  Also, the scaling story is pretty painful, as you’ll hit IOPS, buffer pool, or CPU ceilings faster than expected.\n\nI think OpenSearch serverless is the way to go in your scenario.

The key is modeling the index carefully and being very intentional about analyzers so you do not blow up query latency.

I have seen similar setups hit your latency targets as long as the queries stay scoped and you resist turning every field into a fuzzy search field.",

      "text": "A few days ago I posted a benchmark here showing Llama 3.2 (3B, Int4) running on Lambda with sub-500ms cold starts. The reaction was skeptical, with many folks sharing their own 10s+ spin-up times for similar workloads.\n\nI wanted to share the specific architecture and configuration that made that benchmark possible. It wasn't a private feature; it was about exploiting how Lambda allocates resources.\n\nHere is the TL;DR of the setup:\n\n**1. The 10GB Memory \"Hack\" is for vCPUs, not RAM.** This is the most critical part. A 3GB model doesn't need 10GB of RAM, but in Lambda, you can't get CPU without memory. At 1,769 MB, you only get 1 vCPU.\n\n* To get the **6 vCPUs** needed to saturate thread pools for parallel model deserialization (e.g., with PyTorch/ONNX Runtime), you need to provision **\\~10GB of memory**.\n* The higher memory also comes with more memory bandwidth, which helps immensely.\n* **Counter-intuitively, this can be cheaper.** The function runs so much faster that the total cost per invocation is often lower than a 4GB function that runs for 5x longer.\n\n**2. Defeating the \"Import Tax\" with Container Streaming.** Standard Python imports like `import torch` are slow. I used Lambda's **container image streaming**. By structuring the Dockerfile so the model weights are in the lower layers, Lambda starts streaming the data *before* the runtime fully initializes, effectively paralleling the two biggest bottlenecks.\n\n**The Results (from my lab):**\n\n* **Vanilla Python (S3 pull):** \\~8s cold start. Unusable.\n* **Optimized Python (10GB + Streaming):** \\~480ms cold start. This was the Reddit post.\n* **Rust + ONNX Runtime:** \\~380ms cold start. The fastest, but highest engineering effort.\n\nI wrote up a full deep dive with the Terraform code, a more detailed benchmark breakdown, and a decision matrix on when *not* to use this approach (e.g., high, steady QPS).\n\n[**https://www.rack2cloud.com/lambda-cold-start-optimization-llama-3-2-benchmark/**](https://www.rack2cloud.com/lambda-cold-start-optimization-llama-3-2-benchmark/)\n\nI'm curious if others have played with high-memory Lambdas specifically for the CPU benefits on CPU-bound init tasks. Is the trade-off worth it for your use cases?",

Since that much memory/vCPU was overkill for the rest of the app, we ended up having to have two Lambdas with different memory configs that effectively ran the same code, with the smaller REST API Lambda calling the bigger image processing Lambda as needed. It generally worked, but was more of a headache than one would think at first glance.\n\n\nStill, interesting you managed to make this work in Lambda so effectively. I've played around with running small LLMs in Lambda with some success, so adding some of the details you mentioned might make a big difference.",

If you ran your lightweight REST API handler on that 10GB instance, you’d be burning significant budget on idle vCPUs just waiting for network I/O. By decoupling them, you aligned the resource profiles to the actual work being done. It hurts to manage, but it's the correct design pattern for cost and performance.\n\nDefinitely give the container streaming setup a shot for your LLM experiments. The high vCPU count *really* shines when it can parallelize the layer download and the model deserialization simultaneously. Please let us know if you see similar gains.",

What actually hurts is the constant context switching while trying to understand how a system fits together, what depends on what, and what changed recently.\n\nAs systems grow, this feels like it gets exponentially harder. Add logs and now you’ve created a million new events to dig through.. Add another database and suddenly you’re dealing with subnet constraints or a DB choice that’s expensive as hell, and no one noticed until later. Everyone knows their slice, but the full picture lives nowhere, so bit rot just keeps creeping in.\n\nThis feels even worse now that AI agents are pushing a ton of slop ..i mean code and config changes quickly. Things are moving at lightspeed, I cant be the only one feeling like my understanding is falling behind daily.\n\nI’m honestly stuck on how people handle this well in practice.

In reality that doesn't really work out very often, but what you can do is apply the same rules as you'd do in namespaces/modules/packages/boundaries, things that only matter very close to the technical 'thing' and don't spill over into other areas (outside of its own boundary) would be in your commit message, code comments, or repository docs for example. You'd have to have rules and processes in place to not merge code that doesn't have an intent described and attached to it.",
