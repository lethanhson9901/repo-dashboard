      "text": "Hey all.\n\n  Quick post of something I noticed over the weekend which might trip up someone else.\n\n\nWas pushing a Docker image into ECR using a GitHub Actions deployment workflow, a workflow that's been same-same for a good six months and suddenly two days prior was failing with the following error:\n\n```\nunknown: unexpected status from HEAD request to https://XXXXX.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/v2/XXXX/XXXX/manifests/sha256:XXXX: 403 Forbidden\nmake: *** [Makefile:68: burp] Error 1\nError: Process completed with exit code 2.\n```\n\nAfter a little head scratching, I pulled out a few community threads via Google - all from 1 - 2 years ago, but suspiciously had some very recent comments (two days prior) on them with similar issues:\n\n- https://repost.aws/questions/QUYf5U-mW3SqaYKFEvbr9fzw/suddenly-getting-403-on-pushing-my-containers-to-ecs\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79137398/gitlab-cicd-issue-403-forbidden-while-pushing-docker-image-to-aws-ecr\n\nThe IAM role used in my GitHub workflow was (as it should be) fairly restrictive - with the following IAM actions only:\n\n```\necr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability\necr:CompleteLayerUpload\necr:InitiateLayerUpload\necr:PutImage\necr:UploadLayerPart\n```\n\nThese are all honed against a [specific ECR repository ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonelasticcontainerregistry.html#amazonelasticcontainerregistry-repository).\n\nTurns out, adding `ecr:BatchGetImage` was the fix - this provides the ability for querying image digests from within ECR, which is exactly where the HTTP HEAD error lies.\n\nSo, it seems a recent release of Docker CLI has changed the behavior of `docker push` to now query image digests during an image push and I can only assume this version recently landed on GitHub managed workflow runners.\n\nAnyway... hopefully this helps someone else out of a bind!\n",

I could get behind a one time purchase or a yearly subscription, but tying the costs to the number of builds is flat out wrong. Some projects are built frequently and would burn through their plans (and I think's that's exactly why they target CI for the monetization). Imagine using a Jetbrains IDE and having to pay for each project you create. I hope alternatives emerge in the future, especially if integrated in TestContainers as LocalStack is. For now I'll resort to pinning the version, and move away for future projects.",

And this is one of those cases.\n\nI work on a service that runs in AWS and depends on a fair number of AWS services - S3, DDB, EventBridge, Fargate, Lambda, SQS, and probably others I've forgotten about. Testing the full service and running end-to-end tests is painful, and requires deploying a lot of CFN stacks to a dev account.\n\nWe have started using agents to write our code (Kiro CLI + Claude 4.5 Opus) and are producing _far_ more code than we can realistically test. So we needed a new way to test it that the agents could use without human intervention.\n\nI watched a video where someone talked about exactly this problem, and he suggested faking your dependencies and testing locally; that is a lot of work, but it is the kind of work that AI can do extremely easily. It's not complicated or subtle, it just requires knowledge of all the AWS APIs.\n\nIn a few days of running an agent as a background task while I did my day job I had the entire service running on my laptop without using a single real AWS service. The agent built local HTTP servers that fake the AWS service APIs so my service code SDK calls still work. I just have to set `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_<SERVICE>` to override the service URL to be `localhost:<port>`.\n\nI never would have thought is was possible until I tried it, but I believe it now. I think this is one of the challenges of adopting AI - opening your eyes to the things that you never would have considered before, but which are possible now.\n\nEdit: To clarify, my fake AWS services only implement the small subset of the AWS API that my service code uses. Faking the _entire_ API for all of those services would be a big job, but it's one you don't have to do if you are faking services just for your use case.",

AT&T has to pay Verizon so they'll complete the call for you. \n\nBack in the dialup Internet days this led to lots of ISPs being phone companies that didn't provide phone service to individuals. So all calls were inbound this requiring your phone company to pay as well as you paying for the service. \n\nThe Internet still has the same logic. That's why you pay to get your data back, AWS gets charged from their ISP because your ISP effectively charges them. They're just passing on their cost. It's also why inter-AZ and inter-region costs exist. AWS is likely using different last mile providers just due to geography.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m noticing a significant discrepancy in behavior between legacy Network Load Balancers and newly created ones regarding how they handle DNS for Availability Zones with 0 registered targets.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n* **Architecture:** Internet-facing NLB -> Target Group (Instance Type) -> K8s Nodes (NodePort).\n* **Cross-Zone Load Balancing:** **Disabled** (intentionally, for cost/latency reasons in a specific multi-AZ setup).\n* **Scenario:** 3 AZs with one specific AZ (e.g., `ca-central-1d`) has no healthy targets (0 nodes).\n\n**The Discrepancy:**\n\n1. **Old NLB (Created \\~2024):**\n   * **Behavior:** The NLB automatically removes the IP address of the empty AZ from the DNS record.\n   * **Result:** `dig comand` returns only 2 IPs (for the healthy AZs). Traffic is never routed to the empty AZ. Everything works.\n   * If we terminate all instances from the first AZ (1a) with AWS FIS, the DNS assigned from this AZ was also removed, so we have only one DNS remaining.\n2. **New NLB (Created Feb 2026):**\n   * **Configuration:** Identical to the old one (Terraform/OpenTofu code is the same).\n   * **Behavior:** The NLB **continues to publish the IP** of the empty AZ in the DNS record.\n   * **Result:** `dig` returns 3 IPs. Client traffic is round-robined to the empty AZ (\\~33% of requests). Since Cross-Zone is disabled and there are no local targets, these packets are blackholed, causing immediate connection timeouts/failures.\n\n**Support's Response:** I opened a ticket, and AWS Support claims *\"*After reviewing your case and consulting with our internal resources, I can confirm that \\*\\*this is the expected behavior for Network Load Balancers\\*\\*, and there has been no recent change to how NLBs handle DNS resolution for AZs with no registered targets*.\"*\n\nHowever, the empirical evidence (side-by-side `dig` results on same-region, same-config LBs) suggests otherwise.\n\n**The Impact:** This feels like a silent breaking change. Previously, we relied on the NLB's ability to \"drain\" an AZ from DNS if the backend was dead (fail-open style). Now, it seems new NLBs are \"sticky\" to their AZs regardless of backend health, which breaks standard DR/Failover patterns where you might spin down an AZ to save costs or during an outage.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Has anyone else noticed this shift in \"Fail Open\" behavior on recent NLBs?\n* Is there a new attribute (hidden or documented) that controls this \"DNS draining\" behavior?\n* Is the only solution now to force Cross-Zone Load Balancing (and pay the transfer costs) or manually manipulate Subnet mappings during an incident?\n\nThanks for any insights.",

The main problem I've had is essentially the LLM \"count to 100\" or \"how many r's are in strawberry\" problem.\n\nLLM would often give a slower and incomplete response, hitting token limits, hallucinating details or re-interpret some lines. I tried again more recently and the models flat out do a tool call to Tesseract.\n\nIt really depends what your use case is though and how accurate you need the OCR. If you have a good quality source image with high DPI and text is well aligned, you get a long way. Textract does give a confidence value on the interpreted text and at the end of the day, Textract is using AI/ML for it's engine, it's just not LLM.",

You can create an Internet gateway to route to/from the internet, or endpoints (think network port) to give access to other services.\n\nInside the vpc you could put an EC2 instance, or RDS database etc.  if it has an IP address it's got an interface connected to your VPC.\n\nA thing in your VPC can also have a security group which is like a simple firewall which defines what traffic is allowed in or out.  This can reference an IP range, or another security group.\n\nBeyond that there are DHCP options, acls etc but honestly, they're way less important.  When you need them you'll know why and Google will be your friend 🙂\n\nOne slightly odd definition that is confusing to start with is public/private subnets.\n\nIn a public subnet you route 0.0.0.0/0 to the Internet gateway.  In a private subnet you don't!  That way resources in the private subnet cannot access or be accessed from the internet.  You can add a NAT gateway if you need outbound internet.  Ironically, because the NAT gateway needs Internet access it lives in the public subnet, but your private route tables have a default route to it.\n\nI hope that's helpful.  AWS networking is weirdly simple once you get used to it, but it can be very confusing initially 👍",

Think of Network ACLs as \"dumb\" rules that just work on IP address and port numbers, akin to `iptables` and they're applied on the subnet level.  Security Groups are smarter - instead of just IP ranges as sources/targets you can use rules like \"members of this security group\", \"members of another security group\", etc. and they're applied on the security group level (which can span several subnets).\n\nI'd strongly advise you use one or the other, never both if you can help it.  Using both together is just a recipe for confusion when traffic isn't working that you think should be because of interactions between the two.  The one you use should (nearly) always be security groups.  Only use network ACLs if you really know what you're doing and have a specific need.  They usually only come into play when you're doing fancier stuff like VPC peering or connecting your VPC back to your datacenter with a VPN.",

      "text": "Hey r/aws,\n\nI've been working on an open source DynamoDB library called **pydynox**. It's a Python ORM but the heavy lifting happens in Rust via PyO3.\n\nWanted to share how I handle async because I think it's interesting.\n\n## The problem with most Python DynamoDB libraries\n\nThey either do sync-only, or they wrap sync calls with `asyncio.to_thread()`. That's not real async. You're still blocking a thread somewhere.\n\n## What I do instead\n\nThe Rust core uses Tokio (Rust's async runtime) to talk to DynamoDB. When you call an async method from Python, it goes like this:\n\n1. Python `await`s the call\n2. PyO3 hands it to Tokio on the Rust side\n3. Tokio makes the HTTP request without holding the GIL\n4. Result comes back to Python\n\nThe GIL is released during the entire network call. Your other Python coroutines keep running. No threads wasted sitting idle waiting for DynamoDB to respond.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nThis helps in any Python app — Lambda, ECS, FastAPI, Django, scripts, whatever.\n\n- Serialization/deserialization happens in Rust — type conversion is fast\n- Compression (zstd) and encryption (AES-GCM) also run in Rust with the GIL released\n- Zero Python runtime dependencies, so installs are small and there are no conflicts\n- On Lambda specifically, cold starts stay lean and warm invocations hit the Rust fast path\n\n## Quick example\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom pydynox import Model, ModelConfig, DynamoDBClient\n\nclient = DynamoDBClient()\n\nclass User(Model):\n    model_config = ModelConfig(table=\"users\")\n    pk: str\n    name: str\n    email: str\n\nasync def main():\n    user = User(pk=\"USER#1\", name=\"John\", email=\"john@example.com\")\n    await user.save()\n\n    found = await User.get(pk=\"USER#1\")\n    print(found.name)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nSync works too — same API, just drop the `await`.\n\n## Performance\n\nSerialization alone is faster because Rust handles the Python-to-DynamoDB type conversion directly instead of going through multiple dict transformations.\n\nThe library is Apache 2.0 and on GitHub.\n\nDocs: [https://ferrumio.github.io/pydynox/](https://ferrumio.github.io/pydynox/)\n\nIf you've tried mixing Rust and Python for AWS stuff, I'd love to hear how it went. Questions are welcome too.\n",

Other threads will happily run while waiting on the HTTP response.\n\nThe other reasons are more compelling:  boto3 is a humongous dependency and its serde is quite slow.",

There are a bunch of limitations like they don't have good of an idea of the tokens used. They also can't stop usage for a specific key that's over allocation. Also it was, for me, logging hundreds of lines of ... errors(?)... when claude code was working against LiteLLM (and it was in fact working through LiteLLM to Bedrock).\n\nSo yes, it's possible.

      "text": "Lex bots use a legacy keyword-based utterance matching approach for intent selection. For all but the simplest contact center solutions, this isn’t a great fit.\n\nConversational prompt–based intent selection is more accurate, provides a better CX experience, and eliminates the need for questions designed to constrain CX replies to specific keywords. It also removes the painful maintenance work of managing long keyword lists to keep intent matching accurate.\n\nTo put it more bluntly, I see Lex bots as technical debt. I continually have to engineer around them to create dynamic interactions that feel like real conversations, rather than a “bot with slots” experience.\n\nI believe a new type of “Get Customer Input” block is needed — one that can interact directly with my prompts and Bedrock. This would allow seamless data exchange between Connect and the conversational AI layer, enabling path and route selections based on GenAI responses rather than basic keyword matching.\n\nI’m aware that Lex now supports “generative assessment” for keyword intents. However, in my testing, enabling this made intent selection worse, not better. The reality is that keyword-based selection simply doesn’t work for advanced conversational interactions — especially when customers may not know the exact keyword that corresponds to their reason for calling.\n\nI’m a huge fan of Connect and have used it for years, but lately, working with Lex has become frustrating. It creates more barriers than bridges, and I believe that’s a serious issue.",

AWS tries to bolt on Bedrock on it, but in my opinion there needs to be a complete different service that AWS needs to create here. Some sort of understanding action service that has conversation, outcomes, and guardrails all in one place. I doubt this would every happen though.",
