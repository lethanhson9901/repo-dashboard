Under US law, authorities can compel a provider subject to US jurisdiction to disclose data that is within the provider’s “possession, custody, or control,” even if the data is stored in Europe. Whether this reaches data “handled by an EU subsidiary” often turns on whether the US parent (or another US-jurisdiction entity) has sufficient legal/technical control over that data, and it can create a direct conflict with GDPR rules on responding to foreign orders.\n\nThe key message here is \"possession and control\". What do you think will happen to AWS US if some susidiary manager says \"no\" to their bosses?

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am looking for guidance on how organizations design and manage AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) permission sets at scale.\n\n**Context**  \nOur AWS permission sets are mapped to AD/Okta groups. Some groups are team-based and have access to multiple AWS accounts. Team membership changes frequently, and we also have users who work across multiple teams.\n\nBecause access is granted at the group level, we often run into situations where access requested for one individual results in broader access for others in the same group who didn’t need or ask for it.\n\nWe also receive a high volume of access change requests. While we try to enforce least privilege, we’re struggling to balance that with operational overhead and permission set sprawl.\n\n**Discussion points**\n\n* How do you structure permission sets and groups to scale without constant rework?\n* Do you use team-based, job-based, or hybrid permission sets?\n* Do you create separate groups per account + team + job role, or use a different model?\n* Do you provide birthright access for engineers? If so:\n   * What does that access look like?\n   * Is it different in sandbox vs non-prod vs prod?\n* How do you determine what access a team actually needs, especially when users don’t know what permissions they require?\n* How do you manage temporary access to a permission set? Do you use cyberark sca?\n* Who approves access to permission set groups (manager, app owner, platform, security, etc.)?\n\nAny real-world patterns, lessons learned, or “what not to do” stories would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

It just is what it is.     \n  \nWe use set of enterprise-wide console roles that are used for most daily access needs, but also provide account-specific permission sets which engineering teams can use to fine-grain their access if it is needed over above the standard roles.\n\nWe had to build quite a bit of custom code to automate a lot of this (based on CloudTrail events coming in from identity store), but a few years in it's working pretty well.\n\nWe also use customer managed policy references heavily to build more granularity:  With some planning you can grant differing permissions using the same permission set, depending on the target (useful for environment tiers in our case).  \n\nBut it could be better.   The next big milestone is to slowly move to an ABAC model where feasible, which should (in theory) help cut down the number of permission sets needed. \n\nAnyway if you have any specific questions feel free to ask.  I'll try to answer best I can.",

Define roles, determine what they need to do in what environments, create PermissionsSets for them then rolling them out. The roles should be enforcing your operating model. e.g.\n\nExamples.\n\nDeveloperSet\n\n* gets almost FullAccess in Dev environments only.\n* SCP whitelist only grants everyone access to specific services.\n* PermissionsBoundary prevents them from self escalating.\n\nTesterSet\n\n* Can read logs, maybe set some data sources.\n* Applies to Dev and UAT.\n\nDevOpsSet\n\n* Access to Prod. Can read logs, manage Support tickets etc.\n* No write access.\n\nAdminSet\n\n* AD group is empty and only used through an audting temporary elevation process.\n* * Prod.\n\nPlatformAdmins\n\n* Gods. Like domain admins. \n* This is you, and you don't get involved in operations. :)\n\nThe same User can be in one or more of the above roles. e.g. Developers and Testers because they are performing those roles. If someone asks for a permission that's not included in the roles above then they are often asking to circumvent the operating model, either because the model is deficient, in which case it needs fixed, or they are just cowboys. (e.g. I want to get into UAT to clickops something because our testing isn't complete and product owner is all over me).\n\nOn defining privileges. YOu tailor it to allow them to get \"quality\" work done quickly. So developers can do a lot in the dev environment, but after that we want the model encourage the maturity of the CICD. So no clickops after Dev environment. It should all be driven by CICD with testing etc all automated.",

I was supposed to enroll an external production account into our prod OU through Control Tower,  which has compliance stacksets and some SCPs that get enforced. I thought I had done my homework - went through all the account resources to make sure nothing would get auto-remediated. But somehow I still managed to screw it up because of a silly reason, there were a few resources sitting in regions we don't govern, and they started throwing forbidden errors everywhere after the enrollment. I fixed it by reverting and unenrolling the account, but the whole thing made me disappointed that how I missed this.\n\nThe thing that really gets me is there's no safety net. When I was a software engineer, I always had QA testing my code before anything touched production. Now every infrastructure change feels like I'm walking a tightrope with no net underneath.\n\nI made the switch from software engineering to cloud operations about two years ago, and honestly, incidents like this make me question whether I made the right call.

Focused on reliability and developer experience, I put together a construct library where services have cost-savings, reliability, security, and scalability baked in from the start.\n\nThis is where I want to introduce a phrase I'm calling Infrastructure as Software. The idea is that these constructs, with minimal input, can be stitched together to build fault-tolerant systems. I built this site as a forcing function to showcase what I've been working on, but more importantly it's how an SRE approaches building self-healing infrastructure.\n\nThere's still more to this project, but for now I want to introduce the philosophy of Infrastructure as Software as I continue to illustrate how these constructs work together to build autonomous systems.\n\nWould love to get the community’s input. \n\n[https://github.com/crmagz/cdk-constructs-library](https://github.com/crmagz/cdk-constructs-library)\n\n[https://thepractitioner.cloud/blog/infrastructure-as-software](https://thepractitioner.cloud/blog/infrastructure-as-software)\n\n[https://thepractitioner.cloud/guides/infrastructure-as-software/introduction](https://thepractitioner.cloud/guides/infrastructure-as-software/introduction)\n\n",

Reliability & Hallucination Prevention\nLLM + CLI (The Risk): When an LLM generates a CLI command, it is guessing the syntax based on its training data. If a flag has changed, or if the model \"hallucinates\" a parameter (e.g., inventing a --force-delete flag that doesn't exist), the command fails. You then have to paste the error back to the LLM to debug.  \nAWS MCP (The Solution): The MCP server exposes defined tools to the LLM. The LLM doesn't guess the command; it selects a tool from a list of valid options provided by the server. The MCP server then constructs the correct API call or CLI command under the hood, ensuring syntax accuracy.  \n2. Context Window Efficiency\nLLM + CLI: To get an LLM to understand your infrastructure via CLI, you often have to run aws ec2 describe-instances, copy the massive JSON output, and paste it into the chat. This eats up your context window rapidly with irrelevant noise.\nAWS MCP: MCP servers are \"context-aware.\" They can fetch only the relevant resources (resources) or summarize data before sending it to the LLM. This keeps the conversation focused and prevents the model from \"forgetting\" earlier instructions due to context overflow.  \n3. Security & Guardrails\nLLM + CLI: If you give an LLM access to a terminal (e.g., via a \"bash\" tool), it effectively has the permissions of your local user. It could accidentally delete resources or upload credentials if you aren't watching every character it types.\nAWS MCP:\nLeast Privilege: You can run the MCP server with a specific, restricted AWS profile or role, independent of your main local credentials.  \nSandboxing: MCP servers can verify the \"intent\" of a command before executing it.\nRead-Only Modes: Many MCP implementations allow you to set the server to \"read-only,\" meaning the LLM can look at your S3 buckets but physically cannot execute a delete or put command, regardless of what the prompt says.\n4. Structured Data vs. Text Parsing\nLLM + CLI: CLI output is text. The LLM has to parse whitespace, tables, or raw JSON text. Complex outputs (like CloudWatch logs or deeply nested JSON) are difficult for an LLM to read reliably without formatting errors.\nAWS MCP: The protocol allows the server to pass structured objects directly to the LLM. It acts like an API integration, meaning the LLM receives clean data structures (lists, dictionaries) rather than a wall of text it has to OCR/parse.\n5. Discovery & Up-to-Date Knowledge\nLLM + CLI: The LLM's knowledge of AWS CLI commands is cut off at its training date. It won't know about a new AWS service released last month.\nAWS MCP: The MCP server is a piece of software you update. If AWS releases a new feature and you update your MCP server, the LLM immediately has access to that \"tool\" and its documentation via the protocol, even if the model itself hasn't been retrained.",

      "text": "Hello friends.\n\nI have a reasonably complex AWS account structure with a bunch of workloads and sandboxes in an AWS Organization. I'm thinking about applying ABAC to simplify IAM setup in certain cases. For example, imagine that we have an account sandbox-bobaduk, where I have broad access for playing around. We also have an account secret-data where we store some dataset in an S3 bucket.\n\nWe use Google Workspace as our IDP, and I can apply tags to my role session based on attributes. For example, I authenticate as arn:aws:sts::$sandbox-bobaduk:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_MyRole_08759cec7ee3fdc9/bobaduk@org.org. Because I used sso to authenticate, I have the tag `team=data-guy` on my role session.\n\nI can write a resource policy for my s3 bucket that allows GetObject if the OrgId=myorg, and the team tag has the value \"data-guy\".\n\nSo far so good.\n\nMy question, which I'm struggling a little to answer is \"can I trust the provenance of that tag?\".\n\nMy thinking is that I can use an SCP that denies tagging a session with the \"team\" tag, unless the user is adopting a role matching \"AWSReservedSSO_*\". \n\nI should also have an SCP that prevents a user from creating a new role or user with that tag.\n\nthe AWSReservedSSO_* roles can only be created by identity centre, and the trust policy restricts their use to identity centre, so with those SCPs in place, am I missing anything? \n\nI don't need transitive tagging for role chaining, because these tags are _only_ used for this kind of cross-account access based on a resource policy. if I assume another role, I should only have the permissions granted explicitly to that role.",

Our concern is around a malicious user rather than an ignorant one - someone who wanted to get access to data could plan a deploy to change tags on things and circumvent our controls.  We have a human review on PR but are concerned about asking devops teams to know enough about tagging to enforce policy - we want technical controls\n\nI think for our most sensitive data we may end up using tagging but adding auditing or a hard scp with specific resources and tag values so only our security team can set/change those tags, then loosen the control and guardrails as data becomes less sensitive so we minimize impact to developers",

Having an account for every dev will cost more — this is blatantly untrue. A lot of studies have shown that in general it costs the same or less.  This is because with shared dev accounts there always ends up with orphaned resources that no seems to be able to say who it belongs to. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen an RDS resource left on all the time because “someone might use it” or “the team can’t remember who provisioned it.”\n2. We don’t have enough people to safely vend these accounts — this is a skill problem. You can create AWS accounts via CloudFormation or Terraform today. There’s tons of AWS services and 3P products that provide automated governance at scale AND meet whatever compliance requirements you need. Any lag in the vending process means you have a manual driven culture somewhere that you need to fix.  There’s a lot of studies I’ve seen over the years that shows a correlation between the time it takes to vend and the success someone has in the clouds. If it takes you two weeks to vend an account, you are probably overpaying for the cloud and not taking full advantage of it.\n3. Our developers will be able to spin up whatever they like — this indicate either you don’t have proper governance in place of your cloud environment or you don’t have the proper tools for safe development. Again this is a solved problem by AWS, the OSS community and 3P. You just need to use the tools available.",

We opened support cases immediately, shared ARNs, detailed timelines, WAF analytics, request counts in the millions per day, and attacker IP samples. AWS acknowledged the issue and escalated it for service-team review and possible billing adjustment.\n\nWhile this review was still ongoing, and despite requesting temporary billing hold during the investigation, the account was suspended for non-payment. We’re now unable to log in to the console, which has taken production applications offline and blocked access to CloudWatch and infrastructure management.\n\nAt this point, we’re trying to understand the correct escalation path. For those who’ve experienced something similar:  \nIs there a recommended way to get an account reinstated while a billing dispute is under review?  \nAre there escalation channels beyond the standard account support form once console access is blocked?\n\nAppreciate any guidance or experiences from the community.",

          "text": "That sounds brutal, and sadly I have seen variations of this before. Once an account is fully suspended, normal support cases tend to stall because billing enforcement is automated and not tightly coupled to ongoing reviews. What helped in one case was getting the account manager or TAM involved, even if they were only loosely attached before. If you do not have one, pushing hard through the billing escalation form and explicitly stating production impact sometimes triggers a different internal queue. It is also worth asking for temporary read-only console access so you can at least validate state and exports. The big lesson I took from this is that billing disputes and security incidents often move on totally different tracks internally, and they do not always talk to each other fast enough.",

With Aurora, you'd have massive fulltext indexes, slow/unpredictable index rebuilds, and performance is likely to bog down quickly under concurrent fuzzy searches.  Also, the scaling story is pretty painful, as you’ll hit IOPS, buffer pool, or CPU ceilings faster than expected.\n\nI think OpenSearch serverless is the way to go in your scenario.  You'll have a little less low-level control for a couple niche tuning settings, and you'll want to do some proactive cost estimation to make sure you know what you're on the hook for, but I still think serverless is the clear winner here.",

The key is modeling the index carefully and being very intentional about analyzers so you do not blow up query latency.

What actually hurts is the constant context switching while trying to understand how a system fits together, what depends on what, and what changed recently.\n\nAs systems grow, this feels like it gets exponentially harder. Add logs and now you’ve created a million new events to dig through.. Add another database and suddenly you’re dealing with subnet constraints or a DB choice that’s expensive as hell, and no one noticed until later. Everyone knows their slice, but the full picture lives nowhere, so bit rot just keeps creeping in.\n\nThis feels even worse now that AI agents are pushing a ton of slop ..i mean code and config changes quickly. Things are moving at lightspeed, I cant be the only one feeling like my understanding is falling behind daily.\n\nI’m honestly stuck on how people handle this well in practice. For folks dealing with real production systems, what’s actually helped? Diagrams, docs, tribal knowledge, tooling, something else? ",

In reality that doesn't really work out very often, but what you can do is apply the same rules as you'd do in namespaces/modules/packages/boundaries, things that only matter very close to the technical 'thing' and don't spill over into other areas (outside of its own boundary) would be in your commit message, code comments, or repository docs for example.

Then only you can fail the pipeline when the code does not hit a particular baseline you set, let it be Code Quality (Sonarqube), SAST / DAST etc.\n\nNow, having said that,  I have implemented the other way also, like a Central Pipeline. The way I did is, all the fields are parametrized with fields for example Application ID for that particular application in our scan tool, Packaged Artifact URL for doing Opensource Library Scan, GIT Repo URL for downloading source for SAST ,  Branch to name a few (it has been 5 years so I dont remember most)\n\nThen the application build pipeline will trigger the scanning Job by calling REST API of CI/CD tool with above parameters filled in. Things like Artifact URL, GIT Repo URL etc would be already available as environment variables. But application ID for Scanning tool, i had to set it manually as a parameter for each pipeline (Devs will fill it, and I just had to give the template)\n\nAPI key for your Scanning tool would be most probably global key. This key can be stored as a variable in the central pipeline itself\n\nI have scaled both the above models for 1000+ pipelines. Works well, but I strongly suggest you to keep these scans and Quality gates as part of the actual build pipeline itself. It can go in parallel with rest of the stages not affecting deployment times. Because at some point, you would want to break the pipelines when code quality goes south.",

If we do create one it is up to us to make sure it works for everyone which is a burden we rather not take on. \n\nSo we decided to decouple enforcement from scanning. In github we can create rulesets that require certain scanning tools to have checked the repository before a PR can be merged. We use this for enforcement while providing pipeline templates and private github actions to help implementation of scanning tools. \n\nThis makes it easier to start enforcement while not being a burden because teams can do their own implementation if ours don’t work. \n\nFor scanning tools that dont integrate with github rulesets checks we have created our own tool to check if the scanning is sufficient.",

The only advantages CF has over TF in my book are that you have a prebuilt IaC setup, and lots of code samples. The rest ... CF is hard to grow, hard to refactor, and a PITA to modularize.

      "text": "A few days ago I posted a benchmark here showing Llama 3.2 (3B, Int4) running on Lambda with sub-500ms cold starts. The reaction was skeptical, with many folks sharing their own 10s+ spin-up times for similar workloads.\n\nI wanted to share the specific architecture and configuration that made that benchmark possible. It wasn't a private feature; it was about exploiting how Lambda allocates resources.\n\nHere is the TL;DR of the setup:\n\n**1. The 10GB Memory \"Hack\" is for vCPUs, not RAM.** This is the most critical part. A 3GB model doesn't need 10GB of RAM, but in Lambda, you can't get CPU without memory. At 1,769 MB, you only get 1 vCPU.\n\n* To get the **6 vCPUs** needed to saturate thread pools for parallel model deserialization (e.g., with PyTorch/ONNX Runtime), you need to provision **\\~10GB of memory**.\n* The higher memory also comes with more memory bandwidth, which helps immensely.\n* **Counter-intuitively, this can be cheaper.** The function runs so much faster that the total cost per invocation is often lower than a 4GB function that runs for 5x longer.\n\n**2. Defeating the \"Import Tax\" with Container Streaming.** Standard Python imports like `import torch` are slow. I used Lambda's **container image streaming**. By structuring the Dockerfile so the model weights are in the lower layers, Lambda starts streaming the data *before* the runtime fully initializes, effectively paralleling the two biggest bottlenecks.\n\n**The Results (from my lab):**\n\n* **Vanilla Python (S3 pull):** \\~8s cold start. Unusable.\n* **Optimized Python (10GB + Streaming):** \\~480ms cold start. This was the Reddit post.\n* **Rust + ONNX Runtime:** \\~380ms cold start. The fastest, but highest engineering effort.\n\nI wrote up a full deep dive with the Terraform code, a more detailed benchmark breakdown, and a decision matrix on when *not* to use this approach (e.g., high, steady QPS).\n\n[**https://www.rack2cloud.com/lambda-cold-start-optimization-llama-3-2-benchmark/**](https://www.rack2cloud.com/lambda-cold-start-optimization-llama-3-2-benchmark/)\n\nI'm curious if others have played with high-memory Lambdas specifically for the CPU benefits on CPU-bound init tasks. Is the trade-off worth it for your use cases?",

Since that much memory/vCPU was overkill for the rest of the app, we ended up having to have two Lambdas with different memory configs that effectively ran the same code, with the smaller REST API Lambda calling the bigger image processing Lambda as needed. It generally worked, but was more of a headache than one would think at first glance.\n\n\nStill, interesting you managed to make this work in Lambda so effectively. I've played around with running small LLMs in Lambda with some success, so adding some of the details you mentioned might make a big difference.",

              "text": "That is a perfect real-world example of this dynamic in action. It’s validating to hear you ran into the same CPU-bound constraints with image processing.\n\nRegarding the \"headache\" of splitting into two Lambdas (small router vs. big processor): I feel your pain on the operational overhead, but architecturally, **you absolutely made the right call.**\n\nThis is the classic serverless trade-off: operational complexity vs. execution efficiency. If you ran your lightweight REST API handler on that 10GB instance, you’d be burning significant budget on idle vCPUs just waiting for network I/O. By decoupling them, you aligned the resource profiles to the actual work being done. It hurts to manage, but it's the correct design pattern for cost and performance.\n\nDefinitely give the container streaming setup a shot for your LLM experiments. The high vCPU count *really* shines when it can parallelize the layer download and the model deserialization simultaneously. Please let us know if you see similar gains.",

          "text": "the vcpu angle is underrated. most people think of lambda memory as ram when its really a proxy for compute allocation. seen this same pattern work for build processes and data transforms where you overprovision memory just to get more cpu and end up paying less because runtime drops by 5x\n\ncontainer streaming is clever but i wonder about cache hit rates in production. if youre getting consistent traffic the warm pool keeps things fast anyway but for true sporadic workloads this makes sense. curious what your p99 looks like over a week vs just the cold start number",

              "text": "Yeah, the memory CPU realization is the unlock. I use that same over-provisioning trick for batch jobs now; it feels wrong to throw 10GB at a 500MB process, but the runtime speedup usually makes the pricing math work out in your favor.\n\nOn the weekly P99 question that's the real reality check.\n\nIn my testing over a week with \"choppy\" traffic (enough gaps to trigger frequent cold starts, but some sustained bursts), my weekly P99 hovered around 550ms–600ms.\n\nIt’s actually slightly *higher* than the pure cold start benchmark (480ms) because real-world noise drags it up network jitters, DynamoDB latency on the lookups, etc.\n\nIf your traffic is totally sporadic (like one request every 2 hours), your P99 is basically just going to be that cold start number every time. But in a mixed workload, the warm starts (sub-100ms) drag the average down, while the cold starts define the tail.",
