      "text": "I refused to pay for a dedicated SageMaker endpoint (or even a reserved EC2) for an internal chatbot that gets hit maybe 40–60 times a day. It felt like lighting money on fire.\n\nEveryone told me not to bother with Lambda because of cold starts — and honestly, they were right at first. Out of the box, loading a \\~4GB model took \\~40 seconds. Completely unusable for anything chat-like. I wasted a few hours proving that point.\n\nBut I went down a rabbit hole over the weekend and ended up with something that’s actually usable. I’m seeing cold starts consistently under \\~500ms now.\n\nTwo things that mattered way more than I expected:\n\n**1)** You have to “waste” RAM to get CPU  \nI initially ran it at 4GB since the model fit, but inference was crawling at \\~3–4 tokens/sec. Lambda throttles CPU pretty hard unless you provision more memory.\n\nI cranked it up (mostly to unlock the 6 vCPUs), and inference jumped to \\~18–22 tokens/sec. Same code, same model — just more memory.\n\n**2**) Bypassing disk entirely to fix cold starts  \nSnapStart helps, but it currently doesn’t work with Python container images and caps `/tmp` at 512MB, which is too small for the model.\n\nSo I did something a bit ugly.\n\nDuring the init phase, I stream the model bytes straight from S3 into RAM using `memfd_create` (anonymous memory-backed files). I hand that file descriptor to `llama.cpp`, which thinks it’s reading a file — but it never touches disk.\n\nWhen SnapStart snapshots the function, it captures that in-memory model. On restore, the model is already “loaded,” which kills the cold start.\n\nThis definitely isn’t something I’d ship blindly. Debugging is painful, memory visibility is opaque, and I wouldn’t be shocked if AWS breaks this in a future runtime. But for this use case, it’s been stable so far.\n\nI wrote up the full architecture and code snippets separately because it didn’t really fit in a Reddit post. If anyone wants the full breakdown, I can drop the link in the comments.\n\nSide question: has anyone replaced Step Functions with Durable Functions for this kind of orchestration? I’m tempted to simplify state management, but I’m worried the state history storage costs might sneak up later.",

The 500ms hit I’m talking about is that brutal first request where the user is usually stuck waiting for the weights to page into RAM from scratch.\n\nPinging them to keep them warm definitely helps, but it gets tricky with concurrency. If you get a sudden burst, Lambda spins up new containers that haven't been 'pinged,' and those users hit the wall again. The goal here was to make the actual initialization logic so lean that even a fresh, un-warmed container feels fast.\n\nAre you seeing the memory overhead stay stable with lru\\_cache?

Yah, you'll never see a route to or from that address, I'm not even sure it's internally used by anything and isn't just legacy at this point.\n\nThis btw is why tools like traceroute don't work in VPC: There's no visible routing hop for traceroute to expose, even when crossing VPC to VPC.  The only hops are at the edges of VPC (Internet, VPN, etc).  \n  \nRelated, this is indirectly why traceroute isn't \"needed\" because a packet can't get blocked partway through VPC routing.  That's because VPC evaluates the path before the packet even leaves the device and nothing that can't route will be sent at all, it dies at the source.  So even if you've got layers of NACLs and Security Groups and going across multiple VPCs etc, if there's a block in any of those policies the packet won't even leave the ENI.",

Thinking of it as a distributed, managed router built into the AWS backbone is the right way to frame it. The route tables you configure are the equivalent of what you would put on a physical router, they are just applied across the underlying infrastructure rather than on a single device. This is because AWS handles routing at the hypervisor and software defined networking level. Once I got comfortable with that, I stopped worrying about it. It requires less configuration, less maintenance, and very rarely needs to be tweaked. I must say having used other clouds, this abstraction model is much more approachable than they are, especially versus Azure. At least for me.",

          "text": "So, in AWS there are definitely things that are abstracted away, but you still have all the basics that are there. You have VPCs which contain subnets, route tables, transit gateways, etc...\n\nTo answer your questions specifically:  \n\n\n\\- Two subnets in the same VPC can talk without any visible router:  \nIf you go and look at your route tables in your VPC, anytime you see a route that says \"local\" in the \"Target\" field, that basically means \"use the VPCs internal routing mechanisms because it knows what's attached to itself\". If you create a VPC with CIDR range of 10.0.0.0/24, and then create 2 subnets (10.0.0.0/25 and 10.0.0.128/25), each of those has some reserved IP addresses, one of which is the \"router\" for that subnet. So, 10.0.0.0/25 and 10.0.0.128/25 can talk to each other because they are \"local\" to each other. Think of it as a Layer 3 switch that has 2 SVIs with the same subnets. They can both route to each other because they are aware of each other on the same switch. i.e. \"LOCAL\". It's a little more complicated than that under the hood of AWS, but in a nutshell that's how it's working\n\n\\- Two VPCs can talk using VPC peering, but peering itself isn't a \"network\" and doesn't have IPs  \nTrue. There is no \"transit\" network with VPC peering. However, remember those hidden and reserved IPs? Under the hood, conceptually, what is happening is think of it as connecting a Layer 3 switch with a Router. Just because they are connected doesn't mean they can talk to each other. However, go into their routing tables and define the next hop IPs, and they can. In AWS, you're pretty much doing the same thing by having the following: 2 VPCs with 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24 peered. Now, in a routing table, you'll be able to select the Peering Connection as the \"Target\". So, in VPC1, you'd have a route that would look something like this: 10.0.1.0/24 with Target of \"pcx-GobbeldyGook\", so anything that uses that routing table knows \"use the peering connection\". It's the same thing as defining the next hop, you just don't have implicit access to those IP addresses under the hood.\n\n\\- There's no device with 2 interfaces that I can configure  \nThat's kinda the whole point. When you're automating this (i.e. CLI or CloudFormation), you don't want to end user to have to define and be aware of every single little thing. If they can make it to where I use 1 line or 1 command to configure something, they have a customer. It also helps prevent someone from fat-fingering a route. How many times have you heard someone say \"oh, I typed in the wrong route\". It still happens (i.e. you referenced the wrong peering connection), but the result isn't \"I locked myself out of the device or AWS out of the device\", it's \"traffic stops flowing, let me go make a change to my config, ok now it's back up\".\n\nEveryone I know that came from a networking background, when talking about cloud, either loves it or hates it. Something *IS* routing the traffic, it's the abstracted thing that you don't have to manage. The \"correct\" way to think about networking in the cloud, in my opinion, is that it's someone else managing the complexity of routing protocols, device configuration VLAN/VXLAN configuration. Really you end up moving more into \"AWS does this better/worse than Azure/GCP\", and less about the underlying technology. You really just need to know how AWS implements the stuff and how the configurations ensure the traffic flows as intended/expected.\n\nJust my $0.02",

To be clear, what happens as that packet travels through the VPC service itself doesn't use or even know about your \"subnets\" or \"routers\" or anything else.  *ALL* VPC knows about once it's in its care is the ENI source/destination IDs (not the IPs on those ENIs; the *ENI ID*).\n\nThis is why tools like traceroute don't work in VPC.  There's no user-visible \"hop\" for traceroute to ping, there's no \"route\" to discover, and if anything like a NACL blocks the connection it's blocked *before the packet even leaves the ENI at all.* \\-Packets only get sent if they *can* be delivered, a determination VPC makes before it even accepts the packet at all.",

                  "text": "Amazon’s preference for DynamoDB over RDS for internal services stems from hard-learned lessons about building systems at massive scale. The core issue is that traditional relational databases with table joins fundamentally don’t scale for low-latency, high-throughput services. At Amazon’s scale, this becomes a critical architectural constraint.\n\nWhen you perform joins across tables in a relational database, the complexity grows with your data size. What works fine for millions of rows becomes problematic at billions. More importantly, joins require the database to do significant computational work at query time, which introduces unpredictable latency. For services handling 1K - 10M requests per second where every millisecond matters, this variability is unacceptable. You can’t maintain tight p99 latency guarantees when your database might suddenly need to scan and correlate large datasets.\n\nDynamoDB’s design philosophy is different: push the complexity to application logic at write time rather than database logic at read time. By denormalizing data and organizing it around access patterns, you get predictable single-digit millisecond reads regardless of your total data size. This trades developer convenience for operational reliability which is exactly what Amazon needs for services like retail, fulfillment, advertising, and AWS itself.\n\nThe licensing situation with Oracle added another dimension to this shift. As Amazon grew, Oracle licensing costs became astronomical and the vendor relationship grew contentious. This created financial pressure and strategic risk around depending on a competitor’s database technology. The move away from Oracle-based RDS toward purpose-built databases like DynamoDB was partly about cost, but more-so about control and architectural fit.\n\nAlso the requirement for senior leadership approval to use RDS isn’t about RDS being bad per se, but it’s about making engineers seriously consider whether they actually need relational features. Most services don’t need joins if they’re designed with the right data model. The approval process forces teams to justify why they can’t use DynamoDB’s access patterns, ensuring that services are built with scalability and operational excellence in mind from the start rather than hitting scaling walls later.\n\nFor the uninitiated, [here’s a ~7 year old YT video about DDB](https://youtu.be/HaEPXoXVf2k) which contains a fantastic “history” section at the beginning. The whole thing is worth watching.",

What you want to do is encode the read marks as a list of ranges. For simplicity, if we assume the ids are ints, you will have `[(1,5),(7,15),(17,17)]` meaning messages 1-5,7-15 and 17 have been marked as read. (If we assume that all messages will eventually be marked read, it can be easier to view the list as unread message ranges instead.) In practice, such a list is unlikely to ever grow large. Typically, you cache these ranges in memory and use them to inform queries as needed.\n\nI have not done this in DynamoDB, but I imagine that if you use timebased UUIDv6/7 ids, it should work just fine.",

All draw operations went into one DDB table (with the session ID as the partition key, and the timestamp as the sort key), and users that were attaching to an existing session did a query for all operations within a particular session ID to get the latest whiteboard status. But... What if somebody pressed the \"clear whiteboard\" button? There was no way to do a query for all operations since a particular operation happened, within a single table setup.\n\nSo in the end I implemented a second table with just the timestamp of the last clear operation of a session (partition key session ID, no sort key). So users would first query that second table with their session ID, get the timestamp of the last clear operation, and then query the operations table, but only for operations with that session ID and since that timestamp. Works like a charm. You don't even need a secondary index or something, since the timestamp was used as the sort key anyway, which gives an implicit index.\n\nA background query/scan operation is then used to purge the first table of stale entries every now and then.\n\nYou can do the same, by setting up an additional table where you store the timestamp of the \"Mark all Unread\" operations, with your user ID as the partition key. Your code should query that first, and then use that timestamp to only request data for that user, that is newer than that timestamp. If the timestamp is your sort key, then things are very easy. But if your timestamp is a non-indexed field, it may help to put a local secondary index on it. (It doesn't have to be a global secondary index in this case, as you won't be querying by specific timestamps.)\n\nThis also means that you don't have to update all your notifications when a user clicks on \"Mark all Read\". The only thing you need to think about - maybe - is the situation where a user clicks on \"Mark all Read\" and then wants to flag certain notifications as Unread anyway.",

Depending on size this could be a per-user record, a per-user ddb table or (probably best) an s3 blob. You could use SQS if you were willing to let notificatuons expire within ~4 days\n- each time a new notification comes, update this per-user structure. Make sure it has metadata for a counter so you can efficiently display the notification count without parsing the whole thing \n- if the user hits \"mark all as read\", delete their user-specific record/table/s3 blob or purge their sqs \n\nThe duplication means you can do the delete in one operation without losing the original notifications (otherwise you could considering having a similar per-user structure for \"read notifications\" but at that point you've abandoned you (poorly thought out) original ddb schema for notifications) \n\nPushing it to s3 keeps it scalable. Even if a user legitimately has thousands of unread notifications they can't humanly read all of them at once anyway, so persisting them individually isn't really required. If they want to read a particular past notification (read or unread) that you let them addtess, they can just go directly to your original ddb table and read it by id.",

              "text": "CDK is problematic and limited in use case.  There's a number of unfixable issues with it, some of which you won't \"see\" in particular situations (if you're purely a dev, for example), some of which you can't avoid forever.\n\nCDK as it's currently implemented is sugar over CloudFormation.  As a result it brings forward the large set of intractable baggage that CloudFormation has.\n\nAs a syntactic sugar layer over CF it *does* address some of CF's larger warts such as requiring the complexities of Lambda backed custom resources for things so mundane as a random name generator for resource IDs or a lookup of an existing subnet to deploy to by tag filter.  Arguably the #1 killer feature of CDK is that it effectively wraps that whole insanity away in a construct.  But...it's still ultimately a custom lambda and everything that comes with it that must live for the life of your stack despite doing nothing after deployment.  And the real kicker is this model that CF uses is incredibly fragile.  CDK goes to great pains to try and bullet proof the code here, but it can only do so much as the architecture of CloudFormation is intrinsically fragile and when (not if) it fails it can often result in extremely difficult if not completely impossible to fix problems.  Problems that can require tearing the entire stack down, manually finding what it couldn't destroy and cleaning that out, and only after hours of waiting for CF to timeout its failures all while your prod sits dead in the water while you scream at AWS support to kick it over on the back end.\n\nTerraform's data resources make most of CDK/CF web of custom lambda hack resources a non-event.  What can't be handled by data resources is handled by utility providers like \"random\".  But the biggest win here is that you can *always* fix a broken terraform stack / state / etc and you never have to fight with the trainwreck of a service that CloudFormation is to do so.  TF stacks have far less issues in general because the model is far cleaner, but when they do have issues they're far easier and faster to identify and fix because you aren't dealing with the blackbox of CloudFormation that stuck in some operation you can't force quit or force fail.\n\nAnd then there's inter-department needs.  CDK is ok for developers that are deeply familiar with the advanced features of their target programming language, but try collaborating with the Networking, Security, Auditing, Admin teams in larger orgs about resource configurations and you'll quickly find that almost no one else can read your skibidi toilet code much less grok how the resources are actually being configured.  The cop out from developers is always, \"Oh just synthesize to CF\" as if autogenerated CF is much better; it might as well be minified javascript.  TF's plan output is both incredibly clean, it's also very complete, and doesn't require any assumptions or masters in software engineering to grok.\n\nCDK being glorified CloudFormation also means you're stuck with CF's pathetic duct tape solution for dealing with drift.  I know, you'll say drift can't happen if you're \"doing things the right way\", but some of us actually work in reality.\n\nCF is slow.  It's slow when things work correctly, but it's horrifically slow when things to bad.  If you're keeping the default of trying to rollback the entire stack on any failure, you get to not only wait for that entire failure to finish rolling back before you can try to apply the syntax error fix you quickly made, but if you don't really know what went wrong so sorry CF has already started nuking the evidence you need to actually diagnose WTF happened.  Or you can chose to not roll back so you can investigate the failed resources for clues, but it's not like you can sanely fix the code and just roll forward.  Maybe to fix the issue you need to force resources X and Y to be destroyed and rebuilt, but you'd prefer not to rollback the 300 other resources that are fine.  TF that's trivial (just taint the two resources and apply), but in CF you're basically forced to roll the entire thing back and then try again from whole cloth.  What PITA.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that increasingly applications are deploying with a variety of integrations.  Hooking into SaaS observability, hooking into ticketing alert systems, hooking in to 3rd party IdPs like Okta, hooking into CICD to auto-configure GitHub actions, etc.  With CDK you're basically at a dead end: The only option you have is to write your own incredibly hacky, incredibly fragile lambda backed custom resources...including all the insanity of trying to auth all them securely.  \n  \nI've already written a novel and I've only scratched the surface.  There's a reason that you almost never see CDK used for anything more than the most trivial of stack architectures.  Even with a simple \"hey, I'm an api service!\" application stacks it's easy to blow through CF resource count limits on things like API Gateway configurations and force yourself into a bunch of nested CF stacks, massively complicating an already messy system and easily locking yourself into dependency hell between the nested stacks because again, CF has no data resources and imports/exports are a sick joke in practice.\n\nTerraform for infra.

They make the same API calls using AWS SDK to create resources, terraform state management is different compared to CloudFormation (where you don't need to manage state). \n\nBut if you are new to the cloud, start with console. Create, update and delete things directly see what API calls are made in CloudTrail, try doing this with CLI (which makes the same API calls using boto3) then take a dip into CloudFormation (maybe CDK too), then terraform. So you'll get an idea of how things work in AWS. And you'll also feel terraform is faster. \n\nGood luck navigating the docs and breaking things!",

          "text": "So, I have worked with both Cloudformation and Terraform and I can say both are great to work with once you get the base concepts of how to construct the scripts.\n\nLike everybody else here stated, Terraform is better if you find yourself building resources across different clouds, as you save yourself the time to manage the initial configuration, but if you are sure you are staying in the AWS ecosystem you might find it useful that in Cloudformation you may use special functions(like cfn-signal for example, to improve the way your resources are built, that does not exist in Terraform, at least that was the case several years ago, others might correct me if I’m wrong)\n\nAnd just as a personal rant, I would say the only thing I absolutely hate about Terraform is the way the terraform apply command works in a specific situation - if there are multiple resources in your script that you are creating/updating and the operation fails you are left with partially created/updated infrastructure up to the point the failure happened. \n\nI understand why they did it this way, so you are not wasting time on long lasting resource recreation, but in my opinion this is a bad design(I cannot stop drawing parallels with imagining SQL transaction doing this… just catastrophic) The problem with this for me is not on the development environment, where you can play around with resource config and usually resource downtime is not vital, but sometimes it happens on staging or prod(as http errors of TF calling the API still happen, very rarely a bad config would pass the dev env to cause this situation on higher env) but when it does it is undesirable, as you either want to be left with either the initial working version or the final when all the resource changes are applied, not something in between. And here comes the praise for Cloudformation - it always brings back the latest version if an error occurs during script application.\n\nApart from that, I have absolutely no other complaint from Terraform, it’s a great tool. And please don’t put too much weight on that in your final decision, as this happens extremely rarely and as I said it’s more of a personal rant than anything else.",

And that's a good thing, IMHO. Consider the opposite. Suppose that AWS would have a ready-to-go solution that would allow you to make an https:// API call (using a custom domain name), that would invoke code. Now you're managing code in that solution. Then there would be another complete solution that would accept events from some sort of queue and run code in response, with retries upon failure. Now you need to manage code in that solution as well, with slightly different configuration parameters and capabilities. Before you know it, AWS would have to manage 100s of environments where users can run code. Better to have one all-singing-all-dancing solution for running code that can be integrated everywhere: Lambda.\n\n(In reality, AWS already has half a dozen solutions to run code in a serverless fashion. It's not just Lambda, but also Lambda@Edge, CloudFront Functions, SSM Documents and a few others. When for instance a new Python runtime is launched, we always find that support for that runtime in these solutions is added on a different schedule. So we could go to Python 3.13 in Lambda, but not yet in our SSM documents. Grrr.)",

It can even be 50 different things depending on how granular you want to get.\n\nYou can pay someone to make the 5 different things seem like 1 thing, or you could us a service that doesn't have 5 things but only has 1 thing that just happens to be the thing you need.\n\nDoing this yourself on EC2 is also 5 things (if you just pick 5 random things). But EC2 itself is also more than 5 things (Instance, ENI, IP, AMI, EBS, Subnet, VPC, SG, AWS Account) so it's never really 'just the few things you wanted' if you don't specify your scope.\n\nIt can be 'one thing' if you scope it to a single Git repo, but that repo would need all the config to make that 1 thing happen (by doing 5 things in its configuration).\n\nPerhaps the issue here is how you perceive 'things' or 'complexity'; depending on your perspective merely including a standard library for a function that needs a runtime to open a socket and read and write on it is already too complex, but there isn't going to be a solution that doesn't do those things. But is that a problem? Not really, you're probably not even taking those into account because they are just there.\n\nThe same goes for the services and granularity of the components you consume. The complexity doesn't go away, it's just packaged and abstracted differently. Keep in mind that complex ≠ hard (or difficult), it merely means that a thing is composed out of multiple other things.",

Mixing time critical jobs and long running memory heavy tasks in the same worker almost guarantees spikes and restarts. I would split workers by job class first, even if they still share infra, so the heavy batch stuff cannot starve or crash onboarding jobs.\n\nSQS plus autoscaled workers is usually a good baseline because it forces you to think in smaller, bounded jobs and gives you backpressure for free. Redis can work, but it is easier to accidentally turn it into a memory footgun. Also worth looking at streaming large payloads instead of loading everything into memory at once.

If have the API auto scale based on CPU/memory to make sure it stays responsive.  I would go with the SQS option for queueing jobs, because you can auto scale your workers based on queue length, and that way you keep background job processing responsive.\n\nIt's not clear exactly how the background jobs work, i.e. is it always one type of job, or are there multiple different jobs?  Basically I would go with one queue per job type, and have dedicated workers assigned to their own queue, but if that creates extra work, a single queue/worker combo will do fine\n\nLonger term, depending on how the whole system works I might be tempted to convert the API to API gateway.  You can use it to validate requests without code and place items direct into SQS.  Other endpoints can use lambda functions.  For the reports, save them S3 and then in the API return a redirect to a pre-signed S3 url so user can download easily without exposing the bucket itself.  These are future suggestions though, for now just moving away from EC2 and into Fargate with SQS buffering should take you an awfully long way",

          "text": "I also have an app hosted on AWS with an API container and long running tasks. You need to split your tasks between different workers. Have a dedicated worker container for long running tasks and one for short tasks. Create an auto scaling group and policy for each worker. I have mine set to scale based on the size of my task queues, but you can also set it to scale based on memory, cpu, etc. For example, you can create an auto scaling policy for your short tasks to create more worker containers whenever tasks are backed up. That way, there's always a worker container available to process short tasks in case there's a spike in user activity (or migrate short tasks to a lambda function).  You can also set up predictive scaling policies so that your cluster scales automatically ahead of predicted demand patterns. \n\nEither use redis + a lambda function + the EventBridge scheduler, AWS SQS, or a managed solution like Temporal to handle delegation of queued tasks to your worker containers.\n\nFigure out the memory problem first. Your program shouldn't be crashing regardless of spike in user activity. It should be queuing any jobs your container can't handle. I recommend SQS for that. Also make sure you're not saving large files to memory. Use a temp folder to save any large files that you need to return.",

      "text": "Hey ,\n\nA month ago, I posted **CloudSlash**, a tool to identify \"zombie\" infrastructure (unused NAT Gateways, detached EBS, Ghost EKS clusters) and i have been updating here on r/aws ever since. This time the entire core engine was rewritten to prioritize Safety. Here is what is new in V2\n\n**1. The Lazarus Protocol (Undo Button)**\n\nIf you choose to delete a resource (like a Security Group), CloudSlash now snapshots the configuration *\\_before\\_* generating the delete command.\n\nIt creates a \"restore.tf\" file containing the exact **Terraform Import blocks** needed to resurrect that resource in its original state. This removes the \"what if I break prod\" anxiety.\n\n**2. Mock Mode**\n\nA lot of you didn't want to give a random GitHub tool read access to your account just to test it. Fair point.\n\nYou can now run \"cloudslash scan --mock\".\n\nIt simulates a messy AWS environment locally so you can see exactly how the detection logic works and what the TUI looks like without touching your real keys or credentials.\n\n**3. Complete TUI Overhaul**\n\n\\- **Topology View:** Visualize dependencies (e.g., Load Balancer -> Listener -> Target Group).\n\n\\- **Interactive Region Picker:** No more hardcoded regions. It fetches enabled regions dynamically.\n\n\\- **Deep Inspection:** Press \"Enter\" on any resource to see the exact cost velocity and provenance (who created it).\n\n**4. Open Sourced Heuristics**\n\nI removed the \"black box\" nature of the detection. The README now contains a full **Heuristics Catalog** detailing the exact math used to flag a resource (e.g., \"RDS is Idle if CPU < 5% for 7 days AND ConnectionCount == 0\"). You can audit the logic before running it.\n\n**5. Graph Engine**\n\n3x faster graph traversal for large accounts ( > 500 resources ) . I refactored the engine to use flat slices instead of maps and implemented string interning for resource types, reducing RAM usage by \\~40% on large graphs.\n\n**Other Improvements since v1.3:**\n\n\\- **Headless Mode:** \"cloudslash scan --headless\" is now fully stable for CI/CD usage.\n\n\\- **Graph Engine:** 3x faster graph traversal for large accounts (>500 resources).\n\n\\- **Completion Scripts:** Native bash/zsh/fish auto-completion.\n\n\\- Validation: Strict tag-based overrides (\"cloudslash:ignore\") are now respected deeper in the graph.\n\n**andd manyyy moreee**\n\n**License:** Still AGPLv3 (Open Source). No paywalls.\n\n\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash](https://github.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash)\n\nbtw parsing AWS graphs is complex, so if you hit any weird edge cases or bugs , please let me know , i plan to fix them immediately\n\nStars are always appreciated :)\n\n:)  DrSkyle",

An example a of *run-time* relation is APIG -> Lambda -> Dynamo Table, while *permission* relations include the IAM roles and permissions. It would probably be best to split these concerns up into two separate diagrams (and possibly a third: static Cloudfront configuration). [\"Master\" diagrams are generally bad](https://www.ilograph.com/blog/posts/breaking-up-the-master-diagram/).\n\n- The arrows really need labels to tell the viewer what the relations are.",

Until you explicitly click Log out in the Canvas UI, AWS charges you over $1 per hour.\n\nAnd here’s the absurd part: you can close the browser tab, log out of AWS entirely, delete SageMaker resources and Jeff Bezos will still happily keep the session alive and keep charging you.\n\n\nThis behavior started in April 2022. Before that, Canvas was free. I had used it on my personal account in January 2022 for study. I even saw the pricing notice, but thought, “No problem, I won’t use it after April,” and ignored it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was that AWS would keep sessions created months earlier permanently logged in.\n\nFast-forward to mid-July. I came back from vacation, opened my account, and found $600 in charges. I was about to lose my $500 credit and still owe money.\n\nAfter pleading my case with support, they eventually granted me credits to cover the SageMaker Canvas charges.",

      "text": "I built a DynamoDB ORM called pydynox. The core is written in Rust for speed.\n\nI work with DynamoDB + Lambda a lot and got tired of slow serialization in Python, so I moved that part to Rust.\n\n`class User(Model):`  \n`model_config = ModelConfig(table=\"users\")`  \n`pk = String(hash_key=True)`  \n`name = String()`\n\n`user = User(pk=\"USER#123\", name=\"John\")`  \n`user.save()`\n\n`user = await User.get(pk=\"USER#123\")`\n\nHas the usual stuff: batch ops, transactions, GSI, Pydantic, TTL, encryption, compression, async. Also added S3Attribute for large files (DynamoDB has a 400KB limit, so you store the file in S3 and metadata in DynamoDB).\n\nBeen using it in production for a few months now. Works well for my use cases but I'm sure there are edge cases I haven't hit yet.\n\nStill pre-release (0.12.0). Would love to hear what's missing or broken. If you use DynamoDB and want to try it, let me know how it goes.\n\n[https://github.com/leandrodamascena/pydynox](https://github.com/leandrodamascena/pydynox)\n\n**What my project does**\n\nIt's an ORM for DynamoDB. You define models as Python classes and it handles serialization, queries, batch operations, transactions, etc. The heavy work (serialization, compression, encryption) runs in Rust via PyO3.\n\n**Target audience**\n\nPeople who use DynamoDB in Python, especially in AWS Lambda where performance matters. It's in pre-release but I'm using it in production.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nThe main alternative is PynamoDB. pydynox has a similar API but uses Rust for the hot path. Also has some extras like S3Attribute for large files, field-level encryption with KMS, and compression built-in.",

          "text": "neat. I only briefly looked at the code, so apologies if I missed something but you should consider using KMS:GenerateDataKey and handling encryption and decryption client side rather than via KMS:Encrypt/Decrypt. Beyond just running into the [max plaintext size](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html) of 4KB per operation (where a DDB record/field can be up to 400KB), if you do a batch Put with 30 records and each record has 3 encrypted fields, it looks like your library will make 90 calls to KMS:Encrypt. With data keys, you make one KMS call and then encrypt locally 90 times which should be significantly faster.\n\nYou could even just wrap the Rust AWS database encryption SDK if you're willing to live with the extra metadata fields it requires - the ItemEncryptor will let you client-side encrypt and decrypt DDB records without touching DDB, so you can continue to use the DDB client code you wrote. I've never used the Rust one, but I assume it has much the same features as the Java client.\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/database-encryption-sdk/latest/devguide/ddb-rust-using.html#ddb-rust-item-encryptors",

This also deploys a CFN stack set that sets a few bits an pieces up in every account automatically.\n\nWe have an SCP repo that sets up the main guardrails\n\nThe OU structure has 2 parent OUs, core and workload.  Core accounts are for things like Deployment, Security, Network etc.  there aren't many accounts here, but they're each extremely specific.  For example the Deployment account has the OIDC integration with GitHub, security has security hub, inspector, guard duty etc.\n\nUnder workloads we then have business units.  Below that are environment OUs.  This lets us set a few SCPs depending on unit or env so for example we limit EC2 instance sizes in lower environments to keep costs down a bit\n\nOne of our core accounts is called Vending, and has a custom built account vending machine.  It's not hugely complicated but you select your business unit and give it a name and select an owner from a directory, and it creates one a count per env in your business unit. \n\nBending also let's you request an account deletion, but has some approval steps.  It also has a nightly job so that when a user leaves but owns an account it is delegated up to their manager, who can then assign ownership.\n\nBasically, the aim is that each core area doesn't change a lot, accounts can be created/destroyed on demand, and for the most part, AWS takes care of itself and doesn't need teams.to manage it.  Accounts are owned by the teams that use them, one account(across envs) per app\n\nIt sounds complicated, butjin reality it's pretty simple, easily extensible and generally ticks along in the background!\n\nIf you go the TF route, we have a single bucket in the deployment account that all state lives in and is accessible to the whole org via a bucket policy.  State files are read only except for the account you're accessing (e.g. if you are writing state from ac/c 123 you can write to the /123/....key, any other is read only to allow for remote state.\n\nEverything is deployed via cicd, no laptop deploys allowed.  SCP blocks the root user in all accounts with a (usually empty) exception list for emergencies.\n\nWe don't allow r/w access to humans, only the deployment account OIDC roles.  We do have a break-glass option to get admin access, but it's overly complex so won't go into detail.  We use an Okta workflow for it, and it's not ideal but it's rarely used.\n\nOh, and never allow IAM users without a security exception, and that gets reconfirmed every 3 months and has to be signed of by an architect",

      "text": "Hi guys,   \n\nI have experienced issues related to async workflows such as the flow not completing, or not even being triggered when there are multiple hops involved (API gateway -> lambda -> sqs -> lambda...) and things breaking silently.   \n\nI was wondering if you guys have faced similar issues such as not knowing if a flow completed as expected. Especially, at scale when there are 1000s of flows being run in parallel.   \n\nOne example being, I have an EOD workflow that had failed because of a bug in a calculation which decides next steps, and it never sent the message to the queue because of the bug miscalcuting. Therefore it never even threw an error or alert. I only got to know about this a few days later.   \n\nYou can always retrospectively look at logs and try to figure out what went wrong but that would require you knowing that a workflow failed or never got triggered in the first place.   \n\nAre there any tools you use to monitor async workflows and surface these issues? Like track the expected and actual flow? ",

          "text": "Not sure this will solve your issue, but here’s a solution that I use. \n\nTrack the workflow state directly in DynamoDB instead of relying on logs. The core issue is you’re depending on error logs to flag failures, but in this case the bug prevented the message from being sent at all, so there was nothing to log.\n\nInstead, make the expected workflow state something you can query. Set up a job tracking table in Ddb where each step is recorded with a job ID, step name, status like pending, in progress, completed, or failed with a timestamp. Then you query for steps that never completed, not just the ones that failed. \n\nYou can invoke the lambda whenever the task is done.  It queries for jobs where the status isn’t marked as completed and sends an alert if anything’s missing.\n\nThe key idea is to track what should have happened and alert when something doesn’t show up, rather than waiting for an error to tell you something broke. DLQs help if your handler crashes. State tracking catches the silent failures where no message was sent at all.",

The jobs health is just so hard to debug with a ddb record and loads of cloudwatch logs.",

Sorry, English isn't my first language.   \nThe tricky cases I've experienced are not really exceptions or errors inside lambdas but situations where they don't run at all causing workflow to finish halfway. Like an event ridge rule not matching, sns filters dropping messages... Etc.    \n\nIn those scenarios there's no event to trigger an alarm. You only notice it because a downstream effect never happens.   \n\nAny thoughts on catching non-events like that early?",

At a certain point, choreography starts to break down, especially for long-lived or multi-step workflows (mega workflows), because there’s no single place that knows what *should* have happened versus what *actually* did. Correlation IDs and logs help after the fact, but they don’t surface silent failures like a missing branch or an un-emitted event at runtime. For higher-stakes workflows, teams often move to an explicit orchestration layer with durable state, step tracking, timeouts, retries, and compensating actions, so you can alert on “expected step not reached” rather than discovering issues days later. That’s exactly the class of IT operations workflows Luther is designed to handle, including SQS-based flows, with built-in visibility and auditability.

I started with an existing stack that had a handful of resources, and *one* I had purposely drifted and *another* one, \"PermissionsBoundary\", I made a change to in the template.\n\nWithout drift-awareness (i.e. the \"old\" way we're all used to), it wanted to modify the one PermissionsBoundary resource that I had modified in the template. *With* drift-awareness, it wanted to modify the changed resource in the template *and* the resource that I had drifted (yay!) but it *also* wanted to modify several other resources. What's even more strange is that drift-aware change sets show you which resources have drifted, and it indicated that these had *not* (see the images). When I examined the changes it was going to make, I saw a bunch of \"changeset:KNOWN\\_AFTER\\_APPLY\" values where the template was using !ImportValue.\n\nWhat baffles me is I thought that values exported from other stacks *cannot be changed* if they're being imported by other stacks. So, if this stack already is importing a value and the new template *continues* to import it, the value cannot change.\n\nI was really hoping that drift-awareness was going to give us something more like 'terraform plan', but, with it flagging anything using !importValue like this, it makes it almost not worth using.\n\nDoes anybody know of a way to disable that behavior?

I do not think there is a way to disable that behavior today. The only workaround I have seen is minimizing ImportValue usage for things that should never trigger updates, or just mentally filtering those changes out and trusting no-op updates, which is not very satisfying.",

Today it’s more accounts, distributed teams and customers working hybrid making it really difficult.\n\nAll of the above is why SAs are turning more into presales. Partially because in presales PoCs you can get away with IaC PoCs and simple things like that. But also because the customers have changed. Either customers are super deep or not in cloud. The not in cloud ones need to be sold to, they are not self served customers. All those are in cloud already.\n\nWith all the above how do associate SAs make an impact?

It integrates seamlessly with S3; if you work on different file steps across S3 or different prefixes, you don't even need to use SQS. \n\nBesides being faster, it will also be cheaper. With much less configuration \n\nAfter you set up an async Job with lambda for first time, you won't want to go back anymore lol.\n\n> In what cases would lambda not work for your situation?\n\n* Large files: If your code needs to use more than 10GB of memory per file, lambda would not be ideal due to its 10GB memory limit per invocation.\n\n* vendor lock-in: very specific, but some clients tend to switch cloud providers all the time. If you think your company will switch cloud providers, It's best not to use lambda because of the difficulty in applying an \"as-is\" migration to other providers.",

So if you have a workload that is able to keep an EC2 CPU busy for at least about 12.5% on average, that EC2 may work out cheaper than Lambda. (And to be honest, that's probably the most important incentive to look at that new feature that allows you to run Lambda on your own EC2s.)\n\nIn this particular scenario, the EC2 is already there to handle the API workload. If you add a queueing system so that the work can be queued and handled within the spare cycles that the EC2 will probably have anyway, it won't cost anything extra.\n\nAnd depending on how many images need to be converted and how much CPU that's going to cost, you could even consider spinning up additional EC2 instances once there are sufficient images in the queue for an hours work or so. Running an EC2 at full tilt for an hour to clear the queue will definitely be cheaper than using Lambdas in that case.\n\nAnd that means that the OP now needs to trade a simple Lambda based solution against the engineering effort of developing the other solutions. How much is your time worth, vs. what is the cost difference between the different solutions. Are we talking about dozens of pictures per day or are we talking about millions of pictures per day? In the first case you can have a Lambda-based solution up and running with a few hours of engineering time, but in the latter case it may be worth it spending a few days on engineering the cheapest EC2-based solution.\n\nHeck, you could even think of a hybrid approach. Dump all the work in an SQS queue and let this SQS trigger a Lambda. But the Lambda should have a low concurrency value. You then also add an EC2 Auto Scaling group with a min capacity of zero, and a scale-out policy that's dependent on the amount of messages in the queue. If there's more than, say, 15 minutes worth of work in the SQS queue, you add an EC2. If there's more than, say, 60 minutes worth of work in the SQS queue, you add a few more. Scale-in, all the way back to zero, when the queue depth is consistently below the threshold where a Lambda is cheaper. This could well be the cheapest solution overall, but it also allows you to develop and deploy your solution in stages: Start with the Lambda, add the EC2 functionality later or the other way around.",

Cleaning it up without breaking your state file is the actual headache. So for v1.3, I went down the rabbit hole of parsing .tfstate files to fix this.\n\n\n\nThe New Features\n\nThe Terraform Bridge Instead of just telling you \"Delete nat-0abc123\", the tool now scans your local .tfstate (read-only), maps the physical AWS ID to the Terraform Resource Address (e.g., module.vpc.aws\\_nat\\_gateway.main), and generates the specific terraform state rm command for you.\n\nIt also auto-backups your state file before recommending changes. This lets you decouple the resource from your state before you nuke it.\n\nDeeper Waste Detection (The Graph) I moved beyond simple CloudWatch metrics to find \"Second-Order Waste\".\n\n\"Hollow\" Load Balancers: ELBs that look healthy, but their targets are in a subnet with no active route to the internet.\n\n\"Vampire\" EBS: Finds volumes attached to instances that have been stopped for >30 days. You're paying storage costs for a dead server.\n\nEKS Ghost Clusters: AutoScaling Groups that are burning cash but only running DaemonSets (like kube-proxy) with zero actual app pods.\n\n\n\nNew Safety Logic (Open Source)\n\nDeleting resources based purely on \"0% CPU\" is risky, so I added these checks to verify DNS and config data before recommending a delete.\n\nDNS Safety Lock: Before telling you to release an Elastic IP, it checks your Route53 zones. If an A-Record still points to that IP, it stops you. (Prevents subdomain takeovers).\n\nLambda Pruning: Finds functions with 0 invocations in 90 days + no code updates in 6 months.\n\nLog Rot: Identifies CloudWatch Log Groups set to \"Never Expire\" (the AWS default), which silently accumulate TBs of storage costs over time.\n\nOrphaned Snapshots: Flags old EBS snapshots where the original volume was deleted months ago, but the backup was left behind.\n\n\n\nThe Repo & License\n\nThe core scanner, TUI, and detection engine are AGPL (Open Source) and free forever. i sell a Pro License ($49 lifetime) for the automation layer (the scripts that fix the Terraform state for you). Since it's just me building this, the sales keep the project alive and allow me to support grassroots orphanages and animal sanctuaries (I post the receipts on X).\n\n\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash](https://github.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash)\n\n\n\nParsing nested modules in the state file is tricky, so let me know if you hit any edge cases.\n\n:) DrSkyle",

However, it is important to keep some common IaC best practices in mind when modifying your configuration to avoid pipeline failure scenarios.\n\nFor those that spun this up, how customizable is this solution/ how easy is it to live with? I know Control Tower is generally a pain, but leadership is dead set on it, so trying to choose the lesser evil.\n\n  \nThe architecture diagram  \n[https://imgur.com/1PLQctv](https://imgur.com/1PLQctv)",

Usually, but not always, handling such a request is a series of dependent steps that have to be executed in order. It doesn't make sense to use asynchronous/threading in that case.\n\nBut I've written a complex Lambda in the past that was triggered by an API Gateway request, and needed to do a bunch of things, including querying two DynamoDB tables, updating a different DynamoDB table, and making a bunch of API calls back to the API Gateway. (This one was using wss:// so I had to make multiple API calls to the API Gateway to send the wss:// responses to a variety of other channels.) By carefully applying async constructs in the code (using NodeJS Promises and async/await in my case) I was able to run a whole bunch of calls in parallel, significantly reducing latency and cost.\n\nIf your Lambda is triggered from an SQS queue, for instance, then the event that triggers the Lambda holds multiple SQS messages which can usually be handled independently. Writing your code in an async/parallel fashion is pretty much a no-brainer in that case.",

So unless your end point needs to wait on a lot of IO at the same time, your running time will probably be mostly spent waiting for your turn to use the CPU. Lastly, async stuff comes at a cost, as using FastAPI does. Running FastAPI on lambda means you'll likely gonna spend most of your function running time doing a lot of internal mumbo jumbo of FastAPI that's actually irrelevant in lambda's context.",

From the metrics we know that this database is overprovisioned, and we are looking at smaller (cheaper) instances, possibly a db.r7i.xlarge.\n\n(Note that there is a discrepancy in the documentation: [This page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.Concepts.General.InstanceClasses.html) claims that MSSQL SE supports a db.r7i.xlarge, while [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.Support.html) claims it doesn't.)\n\nBased on the CW Metrics and DB Insights I can pretty much predict how the DB will behave regarding CPU, memory, network and EBS I/O when switching instance types. However, the z1d.2xlarge also has 300 GB of NVMe SSD instance store, and I have no clue whether this is used, what for, and whether this will impact performance if I switch to an instance type without instance store. It doesn't seem like there are CW Metrics available for starters, and I also can't find any documentation on it. Does anybody know of a way to understand what's going on with this storage?\n\nThe problem is also that this is a production database that runs 24/7. Due to it being Multi-AZ, switching instance types requires quite a bit of downtime that we have to schedule in advance. This severely limits the ability to experiment. I do have a test environment but I don't have a mock load generator that is representative of the workload.",

You discover that for some reason you need to change your cluster settings.

If you have a separate dev cluster, you can deploy your updated settings to dev first, verify the changes, and then deploy to prod.\n\nNow, it's probably unlikely that you'll need to change cluster settings very often, but it's a good standard practice to keep completely isolated resources for each environment as it avoids guesswork when making updates.\n\nAs a sorta of related anecdote, I was in an environment where we had separate dev and prod resources, but we ran our \"staging\" workloads in the dev environment for acceptance tests. Nonprod is nonprod, right? Turns out, no. A load test against staging knocked our networking offline because we overloaded a NAT server, which then halted all of our dev work because the dev resources were offline. After that, we made sure we had three entirely separate environments, but we would spin down staging when it wasn't in use.",

          "text": "Lets take step back and ask what a ECS cluster is actually abstracting ?\n\nThe cluster abstracts administrative scope. Specifically, it serves as a boundary for three things like :\n\n1. Security and Permissions (IAM)\n\nA cluster is the easiest place to draw a hard line. It is much simpler to say like junior devs can only see or edit things in cluster B than it is to write complex IAM policies that filter specific services or capacity providers inside a single cluster.\n\n2. Namespace and Service Discovery\n\nServices inside a cluster can easily find each other via Service Connect or Cloud Map. If you put your prod and stage environments in the same cluster, they share the same namespace and separating them into clusters prevents stage app from accidentally talking to a prod database due to a naming collision.\n\n3. Monitoring and Cost Allocation\n\nWhile you can tag individual services, it is much easier to look at a CloudWatch dashboard or a billing report broken down by cluster name. It gives you a clear view of a specific environment without the noise of 50 other unrelated services.\n\nNow lets see when should you actually split into different clusters?\n\nSince you mentioned a single cluster allows you the freedom to do what you want, you are technically correct. You don't have to split them. However, you should consider a split if you hit these scenarios:\n\n\\- If someone accidentally deletes the cluster or misconfigures a cluster-wide setting, does the entire company go dark, or just one department?\n\n\\- If most teams have at least two clusters like prod and non prod. This ensures that testing a new capacity provider setting in staging can't accidentally starve your Production services of resources.\n\n\\- If your healthcare related service needs to be GDPR or HIPPA compliant, it's much easier to put it in its own cluster with its own dedicated ASG and restricted access than to try to prove to an auditor that it’s virtually separated from your other services like data ingestion or some other operational in the same cluster.\n\nI have three cluster running for prod, qa and dev. currently only one API service is running once its scale or add more services then will think to categories them better as per compliance or security need etc.\n\nSimple terms like analogy then think of ECS cluster as shopping mall. ECS services are individual store like Apple store, Nike or Starbucks store. Cluster become mall management office. You could have one big mall that holds every store in the city, or you could have five smaller malls. Both setups get the job done, but the management experience changes, handle compliances and each area demand.",

It's completely free now.\n\n* **Unlocked \"State Doctor\":** The feature that maps AWS IDs back to Terraform resource addresses and generates terraform state rm commands is open to everyone.\n* **Unlocked Headless Mode:** You can now run cloudslash scan --headless in your CI/CD pipelines without a key.\n\nThe graph engine we built is really cool (it builds a DAG of your network to mathematically prove isolation), and I decided I'd rather have the tool used widely than hide the best mechanics behind a paywall.\n\n**For those who missed the last post, it:**\n\n* **Finds Waste:** \"Vampire\" NAT Gateways (<1GB traffic), \"Ghost\" EKS clusters (0 pods), and orphaned snapshots.\n* **Fixes State:** Generates surgical Terraform scripts to delete waste without corrupting your state file.\n* **Local-First:** Runs on your machine.

Bedrock usage for Claude shows up as standard Bedrock inference charges, and those did burn down Activate credits for us without any special setup. It applied to Sonnet and Haiku, and Opus as well once it was enabled in the account and region. The main issues I saw were regional availability and service limits, not the credits themselves. If Bedrock is allowed in the region tied to the credits, it just works. The only time it did not was when the account had older credit restrictions or Bedrock was still in preview for that region.",

          "text": "Great question. Unused resources are where most AWS waste hides.\n\nWe focus on \"The Big 3\" ghost costs:\n1. \\*\\*Unattached EBS Volumes\\*\\*: People often miss the \"Delete on termination\" checkbox.\n2. \\*\\*Zombie NAT Gateways\\*\\*: They cost \\~$32/mo even if idle. If you're not using private subnets, you don't need them.\n3. \\*\\*Old Snapshots\\*\\*: EBS and RDS snapshots from years ago that serve no purpose.\n\nTactical advice: Tag everything. If a resource doesn't have a \\`Project\\` or \\`Owner\\` tag, assume it's garbage. We also use a boto3 script to find volumes with 0 IOPS over 7 days—it usually finds \\~15% savings immediately.",

You always want clarification that its safe to terminate. Although the answer is often \"They don't work here anymore.\" Sigh. \n\n  \nAnd also we've all been bitten by the \"I'm 100% positive that we don't need that resource anymore.\" from management/executive. Only to get a call the next day from another department \"Where'd my stuff go?!\" Which is why most of us soft terminate.",
