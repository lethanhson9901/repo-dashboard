Frontend Hosting \n\nThis is an alternative to Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare Pages for deploying SPAs and static websites of all types on AWS.\n\nIt’s based on the traditional method (S3 + Cloudfront) but includes additional features that are a bit harder to an SRE team to build out of the box (feature branch deploys, password protection, redirect management)\n\nI honestly think this is best way to handle frontend deployments on AWS so long as you set this up with IaC\n\n\\2. Backend SDK\n\nGen 1 was heavily opinionated, bound to its CLI, and had unclear boundaries with how interfaced with existing IaC. 90% of pain and strife associated to Amplify in general can be attributed here. \n\nGen 2 fixes many these issues and create clear separation of boundaries between your existing infra as it’s largely based on CDK. \n\nIf you are mostly running lambda backends or need to support older Next.js versions, I’d consider it safe to use\n\nThat said, amplify wouldn’t be my first choice.\n\nI strongly believe sticking to containers simplifies life for everyone, especially when ECS Express Mode or App Runner exist.",

IAM policy based access controls and full audit traceability is a great win in my space especially vs trusting backend code to correctly handle RBAC decision trees.  My API code then only has to care about its actual task knowing the security is handled upstream.",

A few examples of why I find it problematic. \n\n\\* It doesn't have any real state management so if someone changes something outside cloudformation, it won't pick up that change when you run the stack, no warning just silently ignore unless it conflicts and the whole stack will fail.\n\n\\* It treats the whole stack as a single entity so it'll deploy all or nothing.  Some consider this a pro, most just find it annoying because say for example you mistype a security group id you're referencing.  Instead of refusing to create the resource that relies on that group so you can quickly fix it, you need to wait for it to rollback (remove all changes in that stack, get to a good state (UPDATE\\_ROLLBACK\\_COMPLETE) and then you can try again.  That means depending on your stack size, it could take over an hour to fix that simple problem.\n\n\\* It can be difficult to figure out what actually went wrong during stack creation and depending on the state it ends up in, can be difficult to fix and sometimes require you to delete the stack and redeploy.  Another fun feature is the first time you deploy a stack, if it errors out, you have to delete the stack manually.\n\n\\* Some strange behaviors that aren't well documented.  Example: when changing a db subnet group, you remove subnets 1234 and 5678 and add 1919.  It will add 1919 but fail to delete the other 2 even if nothing is using them.\n\nI'm sure others will give many more examples.",

Cloudflare, etc.  Amazon's ability to guarantee a DNS control plane failover in under an hour is unique and a step up above anyone else.

What latency numbers do you see across containers? Could there be some easy fixes to lower this number?\n\nUnfortunately it's very hard to drive change in a big organization, for example one could try to use placement groups but the related ticket has now been blocked for 2 years already, so I would like to hear how would you tackle this problem, supposing that it's a problem that could somehow be solved.",

Plain HTTP will be faster (or HTTP to a local envoy proxy which then maintains TLS connections to the adjacent nodes).  Client side load balancing will be faster instead of load balancers.

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am looking for guidance on how organizations design and manage AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) permission sets at scale.\n\n**Context**  \nOur AWS permission sets are mapped to AD/Okta groups. Some groups are team-based and have access to multiple AWS accounts. Team membership changes frequently, and we also have users who work across multiple teams.\n\nBecause access is granted at the group level, we often run into situations where access requested for one individual results in broader access for others in the same group who didn’t need or ask for it.\n\nWe also receive a high volume of access change requests. While we try to enforce least privilege, we’re struggling to balance that with operational overhead and permission set sprawl.\n\n**Discussion points**\n\n* How do you structure permission sets and groups to scale without constant rework?\n* Do you use team-based, job-based, or hybrid permission sets?\n* Do you create separate groups per account + team + job role, or use a different model?\n* Do you provide birthright access for engineers? If so:\n   * What does that access look like?\n   * Is it different in sandbox vs non-prod vs prod?\n* How do you determine what access a team actually needs, especially when users don’t know what permissions they require?\n* How do you manage temporary access to a permission set? Do you use cyberark sca?\n* Who approves access to permission set groups (manager, app owner, platform, security, etc.)?\n\nAny real-world patterns, lessons learned, or “what not to do” stories would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

It just is what it is.     \n  \nWe use set of enterprise-wide console roles that are used for most daily access needs, but also provide account-specific permission sets which engineering teams can use to fine-grain their access if it is needed over above the standard roles.\n\nWe had to build quite a bit of custom code to automate a lot of this (based on CloudTrail events coming in from identity store), but a few years in it's working pretty well.\n\nWe also use customer managed policy references heavily to build more granularity:  With some planning you can grant differing permissions using the same permission set, depending on the target (useful for environment tiers in our case).  \n\nBut it could be better.   The next big milestone is to slowly move to an ABAC model where feasible, which should (in theory) help cut down the number of permission sets needed. \n\nAnyway if you have any specific questions feel free to ask.  I'll try to answer best I can.",

Define roles, determine what they need to do in what environments, create PermissionsSets for them then rolling them out.

Can read logs, manage Support tickets etc.\n* No write access.\n\nAdminSet\n\n* AD group is empty and only used through an audting temporary elevation process.\n* * Prod.\n\nPlatformAdmins\n\n* Gods. Like domain admins. \n* This is you, and you don't get involved in operations. :)\n\nThe same User can be in one or more of the above roles. e.g. Developers and Testers because they are performing those roles. If someone asks for a permission that's not included in the roles above then they are often asking to circumvent the operating model, either because the model is deficient, in which case it needs fixed, or they are just cowboys. (e.g. I want to get into UAT to clickops something because our testing isn't complete and product owner is all over me).\n\nOn defining privileges. YOu tailor it to allow them to get \"quality\" work done quickly. So developers can do a lot in the dev environment, but after that we want the model encourage the maturity of the CICD. So no clickops after Dev environment. It should all be driven by CICD with testing etc all automated.",

That is, they are more mission critical or less stable generally. So for those, letting them keep some or all of the tools is the right plan, even economically, because incidents cost real money.\n\nI tend to think a standard one size fits all pattern is not wise if you actually want to be reasonably frugal - because time spent on incidents costs a lot, and this can quickly overwhelm your savings on paper.  \n\nAlso important is log retention timeline - even glacier costs more than zero. If you don't need the logs, delete them, don't just automatically downgrade their retention.  Getting the app owners to state plainly and simply what their needs are (and the business why) lets you bucket the log SLA sanely.\n\nIt's better to have a flowchart than a one size fits all rule IMO.",

A common pattern is minimal retention in CloudWatch for operational debugging, then streaming everything to S3 as cheaply as possible and doing search only when needed.\n\nKinesis Firehose to S3 with compression and partitioning is usually the simplest and cheapest long term option. Athena on top of S3 for ad hoc queries beats keeping logs hot in a metrics system. Grafana is fine as a front end, but the real cost savings come from pushing cold data to S3 quickly and being disciplined about retention and sampling.",

      "text": "A few days ago I posted a benchmark here showing Llama 3.2 (3B, Int4) running on Lambda with sub-500ms cold starts. The reaction was skeptical, with many folks sharing their own 10s+ spin-up times for similar workloads.\n\nI wanted to share the specific architecture and configuration that made that benchmark possible. It wasn't a private feature; it was about exploiting how Lambda allocates resources.\n\nHere is the TL;DR of the setup:\n\n**1. The 10GB Memory \"Hack\" is for vCPUs, not RAM.** This is the most critical part. A 3GB model doesn't need 10GB of RAM, but in Lambda, you can't get CPU without memory. At 1,769 MB, you only get 1 vCPU.\n\n* To get the **6 vCPUs** needed to saturate thread pools for parallel model deserialization (e.g., with PyTorch/ONNX Runtime), you need to provision **\\~10GB of memory**.\n* The higher memory also comes with more memory bandwidth, which helps immensely.\n* **Counter-intuitively, this can be cheaper.** The function runs so much faster that the total cost per invocation is often lower than a 4GB function that runs for 5x longer.\n\n**2. Defeating the \"Import Tax\" with Container Streaming.** Standard Python imports like `import torch` are slow. I used Lambda's **container image streaming**. By structuring the Dockerfile so the model weights are in the lower layers, Lambda starts streaming the data *before* the runtime fully initializes, effectively paralleling the two biggest bottlenecks.\n\n**The Results (from my lab):**\n\n* **Vanilla Python (S3 pull):** \\~8s cold start. Unusable.\n* **Optimized Python (10GB + Streaming):** \\~480ms cold start. This was the Reddit post.\n* **Rust + ONNX Runtime:** \\~380ms cold start. The fastest, but highest engineering effort.\n\nI wrote up a full deep dive with the Terraform code, a more detailed benchmark breakdown, and a decision matrix on when *not* to use this approach (e.g., high, steady QPS).\n\n[**https://www.rack2cloud.com/lambda-cold-start-optimization-llama-3-2-benchmark/**](https://www.rack2cloud.com/lambda-cold-start-optimization-llama-3-2-benchmark/)\n\nI'm curious if others have played with high-memory Lambdas specifically for the CPU benefits on CPU-bound init tasks. Is the trade-off worth it for your use cases?",

Since that much memory/vCPU was overkill for the rest of the app, we ended up having to have two Lambdas with different memory configs that effectively ran the same code, with the smaller REST API Lambda calling the bigger image processing Lambda as needed. It generally worked, but was more of a headache than one would think at first glance.\n\n\nStill, interesting you managed to make this work in Lambda so effectively. I've played around with running small LLMs in Lambda with some success, so adding some of the details you mentioned might make a big difference.",

It’s validating to hear you ran into the same CPU-bound constraints with image processing.\n\nRegarding the \"headache\" of splitting into two Lambdas (small router vs. big processor): I feel your pain on the operational overhead, but architecturally, **you absolutely made the right call.**\n\nThis is the classic serverless trade-off: operational complexity vs. execution efficiency. If you ran your lightweight REST API handler on that 10GB instance, you’d be burning significant budget on idle vCPUs just waiting for network I/O. By decoupling them, you aligned the resource profiles to the actual work being done. It hurts to manage, but it's the correct design pattern for cost and performance.\n\nDefinitely give the container streaming setup a shot for your LLM experiments. The high vCPU count *really* shines when it can parallelize the layer download and the model deserialization simultaneously. Please let us know if you see similar gains.",

With Aurora, you'd have massive fulltext indexes, slow/unpredictable index rebuilds, and performance is likely to bog down quickly under concurrent fuzzy searches.  Also, the scaling story is pretty painful, as you’ll hit IOPS, buffer pool, or CPU ceilings faster than expected.\n\nI think OpenSearch serverless is the way to go in your scenario.  You'll have a little less low-level control for a couple niche tuning settings, and you'll want to do some proactive cost estimation to make sure you know what you're on the hook for, but I still think serverless is the clear winner here.",

Or do I put the clients inside of the ones already listed above?**\n\n**So would it be** \n\n* **Option 1:**\n   * X\n      * **Security**\n      * **Infrastructure**\n      * **Sandbox**\n   * **Y**\n      * **Security**\n      * **Infrastructure**\n      * **Sandbox**\n   * **Z**\n      * **Security**\n      * **Infrastructure**\n      * **Sandbox**\n* **Option 2:**\n   * **Security**\n      * **X**\n      * **Y**\n      * **Z**\n   * **Infrastructure**\n      * **X**\n      * **Y**\n      * **Z**\n   * **Sandbox**\n      * **X**\n      * **Y**\n      * **Z**\n\n  \nThis may be a stupid question, and sorry if it is, I am just trying to learn and understand the best structure to use.

ECS Anywhere still treats a cluster as a shared scheduling and control boundary, so putting all locations into one cluster makes it much easier for something to accidentally cross a boundary you do not want crossed. Even if you add constraints, you are fighting the model a bit.\n\nOne cluster per site keeps failure domains clean and matches how your redundancy is designed. It also makes it easier to reason about capacity, deployments, and outages when something goes wrong at a single location. The tradeoff is more clusters to manage, but that tends to be an operational problem you can automate, while cross location blast radius is harder to undo later.",

      "text": "Hello AWS community! \n\nI've found myself in a situation where I'm moving accounts from one Organization to another Organization. In this instance, the source organization is much smaller but heavily uses LZA to deploy their accounts and resources but the target Organization is not currently utilizing LZA. I've mapped out the SCPs, resource shares, Control Tower guardrails, and have made migration plans for moving those resources and accounts into separate OUs to try and logically keep the source accounts in a relatively similar state but LZA stumps me. \n\nI've read through so much of the documentation of LZA but I can't seem to find any sort of path for specifically moving into another Organization. Is it possible to migrate the accounts and pipeline into the target Organization and update the LZA resources with the target organization's OUs, management accounts, and OUs without rollback of the resources? \n\nI've set up Control Tower on the target organization to deploy the same guard rails and I'm going to look to recreate SCPs (from the source organization) in the target organization. My original game plan for account migration was:\n\n1. Unenroll account from source Control Tower and allow the guardrails to be removed\n2. Migrate the account into the target organization into a recreated OU structure without enabling in Control Tower\n3. Clean/Update the Control Tower roles/permissions (AWSControlTowerExecution) in the account to point to the target Organization\n4. Enroll the account in target Organization's Control Tower and allow the guard rails and SCPs to be redeployed\n\nIf I'm understanding LZA correctly, the resources deployed from LZA should not roll back unless the pipeline runs. Is that correct? \n\nWould I be able to update the pipeline's YAML files to reflect the new OUs and management account then run the pipeline to allow it fix itself? I found that I could flag OUs and accounts as 'Ignored' so LZA would ignore any accounts not in the target organization's new OU structure since I don't want to utilize LZA outside of the OUs that I'll be creating/recreating for the migration.\n\nWould it be easier to just uninstall LZA, do the migration, then look to reinstall LZA on the pipeline account? I suppose this method would allow me to update to a newer version of LZA but I'm not sure if that would remove LZA deployed resources. \n\nAny thoughts or considerations will be greatly appreciated! Both organizations are running production workloads so I'm making sure to do my due diligence and have been poring through whitepapers but there isn't much on moving a LZA deployment. I know the tool is loved (and hated) throughout the community so I'm hoping to utilize it in the future but first I need to get the accounts migrated over. ",

The solution for \"*load balancer requests and database won't work*\" is not going to be a single fix.  The fact that things work when you go wide open on the SG is good news as it sorta confirms where your error is.  \n\nYou have two different problems (1) load balancer requests and (2) database communications.  Treat those as individual config errors and test/tweak accordingly. Since this is SG it's almost certain that your SG rules are wrong, probably about the TCP ports involved",

But in the third limitation, it said this is region specific. Whenever I deploy the stack, it deploy it at the account level, and therefore I cannot deploy the stack to a different region. How do I get around this?\n\nI need to deploy this remediation stack to 6 regions. ",

This does get a little complicated as IAM resources are global (but there are regional resources and references within the IAM policies).  I opened an issue on the repo for multi region support.\n\nSome options:\n\n\\- You could modify the IAM resources and wildcard the regions so that your IAM resources can be used.\n\n\\- You could deploy the regional resources (KMS, Lambda, etc) in each region with the updated IAM resources.\n\nThe third limitation refers to an account-level setting for enabling encryption by default for EBS that's region specific.  That part of the sample is not CloudFormation but rather an AWS bash script that you can run in each region (and pass the region as an argument).\n\n  \nAnother way of running it would be via CLI:\n\n  \n`aws ec2 enable-ebs-encryption-by-default --region region`",

In case if you are using default KSM key, not a custom one. Probably it is not needed to be configured for some regions. This sounds odd, but for some unknown reasons, KMS encryption with default key is enabled for several regions",
