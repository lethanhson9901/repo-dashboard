Like it’s no big deal to wipe out these new grads and mid-levels who’ve been grinding here, just to save a buck for the shareholders. I don’t have kids but I think about those new grads all day today. They are someone’s kids, who went to the best CS schools and grinded their asses off to get a job here, and now they’re just getting replaced like nothing.\n\n> Today really hit me. Walked into standup and I’m literally the only non-Indian left in my entire org. I know you read that and thought I’m exaggerating. I’m not. Feels like I’m a stranger in what used to be my home. Corporate greed wins again, and politicians who left their citizens to protect the companies by importing labor and keeping blind eyes on offshore.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1qpuuqo/aws_just_gutted_us_teams/\n\nI don't care what anyone says.

I hated seeing her struggle.  She was / still is a hard working American.  She didn't do anything wrong.\n\nI hate seeing hard working Americans get treated like shit.  Yes, Americans are expensive because everything is expensive here.  Our healthcare, food, shelter, and education all expensive.  I want them to be cheaper but the ultra-wealthy fucks can't seem to pull their heads out of their ass and realize that where they live.  Maybe they think they can flee to another country, or bunker, but they can't.  The US, may not exist as they know it for long given what is happening to hard working Americans.  It is like being pecked to death by ducks.\n\nIt isn't just Amazon.  It is the uncertainty for all Americans about their job future.  There is no guarantee that if you just work hard you will have a job that at least affords enough for you and your family.\n\nRant over, I am tired of this.",

If you're running 24x7x30, it certainly doesn't make sense. You can literally buy a new mac each month for the same cost.

If you go to Supermicro and play with their configurator, you will find their rent-to-buy ratio, though not as crazy as 20 days, will probably just be a few months.\n\nThen, we have the issues that Mac minis are too small. AWS probably needs to install the same hardware for a single Mac mini as they do for a big dual socket AMD server. In the latter case, they can split the machine into many smaller instances to amortize the cost. Mathematically speaking, (M + n)/n > (M + N)/N, where n < N, and in particular if M is about the same as n but insignificant compared to N.\n\nLastly, I suppose there was significant R&D involved putting Macs into AWS, and the total volume they could sell would be insignificant compared to traditional servers. That must have some impact to their pricing decision as well.",

For example, restoring an RDS database from a snapshot using Terraform used to take consistently around **20 minutes**. Lately, the exact same operation (same configuration, same snapshot size) is taking upwards of **45 minutes**.\n\nIt's not just isolated to RDS either; I'm seeing similar delays across other services during `terraform apply`.\n\n**Context:**\n\n* **IaC:** Terraform\n* **Region:** eu-central-1\n* **Timeframe:** Comparison between \\~3 months ago vs. now.\n\nHas anyone else observed this? I'm trying to figure out if this is an account-specific issue (throttling/quotas?), a specific region issue, or if the control plane performance has actually degraded globally.\n\nThanks",

Plain HTTP will be faster (or HTTP to a local envoy proxy which then maintains TLS connections to the adjacent nodes).  Client side load balancing will be faster instead of load balancers.  Are you making cross-az calls?

                  "text": "Are you measuring this as time to first byte, averages of packet latency on the connection, or overall HTTP request execution time?\n\nWe use AWS as well, but network latency within an AZ is almost always sub millisecond. Between AZs it’s more but not much more.  How are you routing traffic between services? Load balancers increase latency, especially if they are L7 (ALB) or add TLS.\n\nIf you don’t, I would recommend adding distributed tracing and per-route latency / throughput metrics would be helpful. OpenTelemetry is great. If you don’t want to pay, the OpenTelemetry collector has auto-instrumentation using ebpf, and yes you can setup the collector along with your service in Fargate.\n\nhttps://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/obi/",

(The overall SA interview structure is consistent between levels; they just have higher expectations for the higher level roles in regards to technical skill, scope of work, and scope of influence.)\n\nTo be clear, their prep materials are around the LP's, but there's not much you can do to prep for the tech parts of the loop; either you know the answers or you don't.\n\nI bought their main interview prep course, and also paid for their Job Description review, which provides a list of likely LP's so you aren't prepping for ones you don't need. I did not purchase their 1-on-1 coaching, or bother with AI Story analysis, but those are products they offer.\n\nThey also have a very-informative [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@amazoninterviewwhizzdayone503) channel with a ton of good content on it, and have a free live Q&A every Monday. (Their YouTube channel is horribly-named, but it's good stuff.)\n\nFor my LP's, I think I had about 45 pages of typed-up stories. (I didn't actually need to refer to my notes during my interview, but I did have a quick-reference-table that I used several times just to remind me of what was in my list of stories.) And I'm sure you know this, but you want to avoid re-using the same story more than once if you can at-all help it.\n\nThe one question that almost got me rejected during phone screen was \"What would you have done better if you had to do it all over again?\" in reference to the flagship project on my CV.

The sample repo uses a custom resource because index creation used to be clunky and they wanted tighter control over timing and permissions. That pattern is still valid, just not the only way now.\n\nCheck two things: the stack execution role and the collection’s access policy.

Currently, we have thousands of documents and it seems overall messy and tedious to have a .metadata.json file associated with each one. Is there any way around this? I want to try and improve the retrieval with implicit metadata filtering.\n\nIn the docs, Bedrock seems to support one centralized metadata.json file for a single CSV with multiple content rows, but I don't see any references to how/if this can be applied to documents that are not CSV.\n\nIs there no way to handle this nicely? Do I need to generate a .metadata.json for each of my thousands of documents?\n\nEdit: I should mention, I'm aware there are other options to handle this, I was just looking for something native to Bedrock to reduce extra ingestion pre-processing steps",
