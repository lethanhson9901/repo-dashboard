Under US law, authorities can compel a provider subject to US jurisdiction to disclose data that is within the provider’s “possession, custody, or control,” even if the data is stored in Europe. Whether this reaches data “handled by an EU subsidiary” often turns on whether the US parent (or another US-jurisdiction entity) has sufficient legal/technical control over that data, and it can create a direct conflict with GDPR rules on responding to foreign orders.\n\nThe key message here is \"possession and control\". What do you think will happen to AWS US if some susidiary manager says \"no\" to their bosses? The only way to circumvent such things at least in parts is to use infrastructure like SAP Delos or Bleu.

      "text": "Hey ,\n\nA month ago, I posted **CloudSlash**, a tool to identify \"zombie\" infrastructure (unused NAT Gateways, detached EBS, Ghost EKS clusters) and i have been updating here on r/aws ever since. This time the entire core engine was rewritten to prioritize Safety. Here is what is new in V2\n\n**1. The Lazarus Protocol (Undo Button)**\n\nIf you choose to delete a resource (like a Security Group), CloudSlash now snapshots the configuration *\\_before\\_* generating the delete command.\n\nIt creates a \"restore.tf\" file containing the exact **Terraform Import blocks** needed to resurrect that resource in its original state. This removes the \"what if I break prod\" anxiety.\n\n**2. Mock Mode**\n\nA lot of you didn't want to give a random GitHub tool read access to your account just to test it. Fair point.\n\nYou can now run \"cloudslash scan --mock\".\n\nIt simulates a messy AWS environment locally so you can see exactly how the detection logic works and what the TUI looks like without touching your real keys or credentials.\n\n**3. Complete TUI Overhaul**\n\n\\- **Topology View:** Visualize dependencies (e.g., Load Balancer -> Listener -> Target Group).\n\n\\- **Interactive Region Picker:** No more hardcoded regions. It fetches enabled regions dynamically.\n\n\\- **Deep Inspection:** Press \"Enter\" on any resource to see the exact cost velocity and provenance (who created it).\n\n**4. Open Sourced Heuristics**\n\nI removed the \"black box\" nature of the detection. The README now contains a full **Heuristics Catalog** detailing the exact math used to flag a resource (e.g., \"RDS is Idle if CPU < 5% for 7 days AND ConnectionCount == 0\"). You can audit the logic before running it.\n\n**5. Graph Engine**\n\n3x faster graph traversal for large accounts ( > 500 resources ) . I refactored the engine to use flat slices instead of maps and implemented string interning for resource types, reducing RAM usage by \\~40% on large graphs.\n\n**Other Improvements since v1.3:**\n\n\\- **Headless Mode:** \"cloudslash scan --headless\" is now fully stable for CI/CD usage.\n\n\\- **Graph Engine:** 3x faster graph traversal for large accounts (>500 resources).\n\n\\- **Completion Scripts:** Native bash/zsh/fish auto-completion.\n\n\\- Validation: Strict tag-based overrides (\"cloudslash:ignore\") are now respected deeper in the graph.\n\n**andd manyyy moreee**\n\n**License:** Still AGPLv3 (Open Source). No paywalls.\n\n\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash](https://github.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash)\n\nbtw parsing AWS graphs is complex, so if you hit any weird edge cases or bugs , please let me know , i plan to fix them immediately\n\nStars are always appreciated :)\n\n:)  DrSkyle",

I was supposed to enroll an external production account into our prod OU through Control Tower,  which has compliance stacksets and some SCPs that get enforced. I thought I had done my homework - went through all the account resources to make sure nothing would get auto-remediated. But somehow I still managed to screw it up because of a silly reason, there were a few resources sitting in regions we don't govern, and they started throwing forbidden errors everywhere after the enrollment. I fixed it by reverting and unenrolling the account, but the whole thing made me disappointed that how I missed this.\n\nThe thing that really gets me is there's no safety net. When I was a software engineer, I always had QA testing my code before anything touched production. Now every infrastructure change feels like I'm walking a tightrope with no net underneath.\n\nI made the switch from software engineering to cloud operations about two years ago, and honestly, incidents like this make me question whether I made the right call.

I started with an existing stack that had a handful of resources, and *one* I had purposely drifted and *another* one, \"PermissionsBoundary\", I made a change to in the template.\n\nWithout drift-awareness (i.e. the \"old\" way we're all used to), it wanted to modify the one PermissionsBoundary resource that I had modified in the template. *With* drift-awareness, it wanted to modify the changed resource in the template *and* the resource that I had drifted (yay!) but it *also* wanted to modify several other resources. What's even more strange is that drift-aware change sets show you which resources have drifted, and it indicated that these had *not* (see the images). When I examined the changes it was going to make, I saw a bunch of \"changeset:KNOWN\\_AFTER\\_APPLY\" values where the template was using !ImportValue.\n\nWhat baffles me is I thought that values exported from other stacks *cannot be changed* if they're being imported by other stacks. So, if this stack already is importing a value and the new template *continues* to import it, the value cannot change.\n\nI was really hoping that drift-awareness was going to give us something more like 'terraform plan', but, with it flagging anything using !importValue like this, it makes it almost not worth using.\n\nDoes anybody know of a way to disable that behavior? Or maybe shed some light on why they made it work like this?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4llmrwnno2dg1.png?width=1375&format=png&auto=webp&s=94c8f1e8dd7c71da5ec7f3b7b23c7ba3cc8c1a69\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1bsp28oo2dg1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3e0f3f47f0352f2f3db7de99325ed32e0619184\n\n",

From what I can tell, drift aware change sets treat !ImportValue as opaque at plan time, so they cannot prove the value is unchanged even if the export is effectively immutable while in use. That’s why you see KNOWN\\_AFTER\\_APPLY and a proposed update even though nothing will really change. It feels less like a real diff and more like CloudFormation being conservative because it cannot resolve the dependency graph across stacks. I do not think there is a way to disable that behavior today. The only workaround I have seen is minimizing ImportValue usage for things that should never trigger updates, or just mentally filtering those changes out and trusting no-op updates, which is not very satisfying.",

Not yours.\n\n    Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS aims to abstract away most aspects of managing its underlying infrastructure as code (IaC) templates from the user. This is facilitated through the use of its configuration files to define your landing zone environment. However, it is important to keep some common IaC best practices in mind when modifying your configuration to avoid pipeline failure scenarios.\n\nFor those that spun this up, how customizable is this solution/ how easy is it to live with? I know Control Tower is generally a pain, but leadership is dead set on it, so trying to choose the lesser evil.\n\n  \nThe architecture diagram  \n[https://imgur.com/1PLQctv](https://imgur.com/1PLQctv)",

If you have a separate dev cluster, you can deploy your updated settings to dev first, verify the changes, and then deploy to prod.\n\nNow, it's probably unlikely that you'll need to change cluster settings very often, but it's a good standard practice to keep completely isolated resources for each environment as it avoids guesswork when making updates.\n\nAs a sorta of related anecdote, I was in an environment where we had separate dev and prod resources, but we ran our \"staging\" workloads in the dev environment for acceptance tests. Nonprod is nonprod, right? Turns out, no. A load test against staging knocked our networking offline because we overloaded a NAT server, which then halted all of our dev work because the dev resources were offline. After that, we made sure we had three entirely separate environments, but we would spin down staging when it wasn't in use.",

          "text": "Lets take step back and ask what a ECS cluster is actually abstracting ?\n\nThe cluster abstracts administrative scope. Specifically, it serves as a boundary for three things like :\n\n1. Security and Permissions (IAM)\n\nA cluster is the easiest place to draw a hard line. It is much simpler to say like junior devs can only see or edit things in cluster B than it is to write complex IAM policies that filter specific services or capacity providers inside a single cluster.\n\n2. Namespace and Service Discovery\n\nServices inside a cluster can easily find each other via Service Connect or Cloud Map. If you put your prod and stage environments in the same cluster, they share the same namespace and separating them into clusters prevents stage app from accidentally talking to a prod database due to a naming collision.\n\n3. Monitoring and Cost Allocation\n\nWhile you can tag individual services, it is much easier to look at a CloudWatch dashboard or a billing report broken down by cluster name. It gives you a clear view of a specific environment without the noise of 50 other unrelated services.\n\nNow lets see when should you actually split into different clusters?\n\nSince you mentioned a single cluster allows you the freedom to do what you want, you are technically correct. You don't have to split them. However, you should consider a split if you hit these scenarios:\n\n\\- If someone accidentally deletes the cluster or misconfigures a cluster-wide setting, does the entire company go dark, or just one department?\n\n\\- If most teams have at least two clusters like prod and non prod. This ensures that testing a new capacity provider setting in staging can't accidentally starve your Production services of resources.\n\n\\- If your healthcare related service needs to be GDPR or HIPPA compliant, it's much easier to put it in its own cluster with its own dedicated ASG and restricted access than to try to prove to an auditor that it’s virtually separated from your other services like data ingestion or some other operational in the same cluster.\n\nI have three cluster running for prod, qa and dev. currently only one API service is running once its scale or add more services then will think to categories them better as per compliance or security need etc.\n\nSimple terms like analogy then think of ECS cluster as shopping mall. ECS services are individual store like Apple store, Nike or Starbucks store. Cluster become mall management office. You could have one big mall that holds every store in the city, or you could have five smaller malls. Both setups get the job done, but the management experience changes, handle compliances and each area demand.",

I'm thinking about applying ABAC to simplify IAM setup in certain cases. For example, imagine that we have an account sandbox-bobaduk, where I have broad access for playing around. We also have an account secret-data where we store some dataset in an S3 bucket.\n\nWe use Google Workspace as our IDP, and I can apply tags to my role session based on attributes. For example, I authenticate as arn:aws:sts::$sandbox-bobaduk:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_MyRole_08759cec7ee3fdc9/bobaduk@org.org. Because I used sso to authenticate, I have the tag `team=data-guy` on my role session.\n\nI can write a resource policy for my s3 bucket that allows GetObject if the OrgId=myorg, and the team tag has the value \"data-guy\".\n\nSo far so good.\n\nMy question, which I'm struggling a little to answer is \"can I trust the provenance of that tag?\".\n\nMy thinking is that I can use an SCP that denies tagging a session with the \"team\" tag, unless the user is adopting a role matching \"AWSReservedSSO_*\". \n\nI should also have an SCP that prevents a user from creating a new role or user with that tag.\n\nthe AWSReservedSSO_* roles can only be created by identity centre, and the trust policy restricts their use to identity centre, so with those SCPs in place, am I missing anything? \n\nI don't need transitive tagging for role chaining, because these tags are _only_ used for this kind of cross-account access based on a resource policy. if I assume another role, I should only have the permissions granted explicitly to that role.",

When it worked, it was because Marketplace reduced friction, not because someone randomly found the listing and bought.\n\nIf traction is low, I would treat it as a support channel rather than a growth engine.

Having an account for every dev will cost more — this is blatantly untrue. A lot of studies have shown that in general it costs the same or less.  This is because with shared dev accounts there always ends up with orphaned resources that no seems to be able to say who it belongs to. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen an RDS resource left on all the time because “someone might use it” or “the team can’t remember who provisioned it.”\n2. We don’t have enough people to safely vend these accounts — this is a skill problem. You can create AWS accounts via CloudFormation or Terraform today. There’s tons of AWS services and 3P products that provide automated governance at scale AND meet whatever compliance requirements you need. Any lag in the vending process means you have a manual driven culture somewhere that you need to fix.  There’s a lot of studies I’ve seen over the years that shows a correlation between the time it takes to vend and the success someone has in the clouds. If it takes you two weeks to vend an account, you are probably overpaying for the cloud and not taking full advantage of it.\n3. Our developers will be able to spin up whatever they like — this indicate either you don’t have proper governance in place of your cloud environment or you don’t have the proper tools for safe development. Again this is a solved problem by AWS, the OSS community and 3P. You just need to use the tools available.",

The biggest unlock is strict ownership and lifecycle metadata, like every environment having an owner, purpose, and expiry baked in at creation time. If environments are created from code and stamped with version info automatically, you can infer what is deployed without anyone manually updating a spreadsheet. Utilization and age are easy once everything is consistently labeled, and you can build a simple read only dashboard on top of that data for non technical folks. The hard part is enforcing cleanup when the expiry hits and making teams feel the cost of leaving things around.

          "text": "My first question would be: Why do you want it separate? Things like SAST / DAST should ideally be part of the individual application pipeline. Then only you can fail the pipeline when the code does not hit a particular baseline you set, let it be Code Quality (Sonarqube), SAST / DAST etc.\n\nNow, having said that,  I have implemented the other way also, like a Central Pipeline. The way I did is, all the fields are parametrized with fields for example Application ID for that particular application in our scan tool, Packaged Artifact URL for doing Opensource Library Scan, GIT Repo URL for downloading source for SAST ,  Branch to name a few (it has been 5 years so I dont remember most)\n\nThen the application build pipeline will trigger the scanning Job by calling REST API of CI/CD tool with above parameters filled in. Things like Artifact URL, GIT Repo URL etc would be already available as environment variables. But application ID for Scanning tool, i had to set it manually as a parameter for each pipeline (Devs will fill it, and I just had to give the template)\n\nAPI key for your Scanning tool would be most probably global key. This key can be stored as a variable in the central pipeline itself\n\nI have scaled both the above models for 1000+ pipelines. Works well, but I strongly suggest you to keep these scans and Quality gates as part of the actual build pipeline itself. It can go in parallel with rest of the stages not affecting deployment times. Because at some point, you would want to break the pipelines when code quality goes south.",

In our company we have 2000+ repositories and a lot of variation in pipelines due to not standardising from the start. \n\nThis makes it hard to enforce a single pipeline for everyone. If we do create one it is up to us to make sure it works for everyone which is a burden we rather not take on. \n\nSo we decided to decouple enforcement from scanning. In github we can create rulesets that require certain scanning tools to have checked the repository before a PR can be merged. We use this for enforcement while providing pipeline templates and private github actions to help implementation of scanning tools. \n\nThis makes it easier to start enforcement while not being a burden because teams can do their own implementation if ours don’t work. \n\nFor scanning tools that dont integrate with github rulesets checks we have created our own tool to check if the scanning is sufficient.",

We do the scanning on our side in our cloud engine so there's no CI/CD configuration for you to have to handle. You can create multiple overlapping \"coding standards\" that can apply to whichever repositories you want, so can create e.g. a \"baseline security\" standard and a \"javascript standard\" and a \"frontend team standard\". \n\nThen you can gate merging of code into your main branch based on whether the Codacy checks passed in the PR.\n\nExtra plus: we have an IDE extension that will run the same checks locally so that by the time your devs get to the PR they should have already resolved all of the issues.\n\nExtra extra plus: the IDE extension \\_forces\\_ AI coding agents to resolve issues in their workflow, before they hand back control to the dev, so issues can get fixed without developers even knowing about them.\n\nYes, this was an advert.

AWS acknowledged the issue and escalated it for service-team review and possible billing adjustment.\n\nWhile this review was still ongoing, and despite requesting temporary billing hold during the investigation, the account was suspended for non-payment. We’re now unable to log in to the console, which has taken production applications offline and blocked access to CloudWatch and infrastructure management.\n\nAt this point, we’re trying to understand the correct escalation path.

          "text": "That sounds brutal, and sadly I have seen variations of this before. Once an account is fully suspended, normal support cases tend to stall because billing enforcement is automated and not tightly coupled to ongoing reviews. What helped in one case was getting the account manager or TAM involved, even if they were only loosely attached before. If you do not have one, pushing hard through the billing escalation form and explicitly stating production impact sometimes triggers a different internal queue. It is also worth asking for temporary read-only console access so you can at least validate state and exports. The big lesson I took from this is that billing disputes and security incidents often move on totally different tracks internally, and they do not always talk to each other fast enough.",

          "text": "This is mostly a consequence of how AWS designs instance families. They optimize for predictable performance, network bandwidth, and failure domains rather than Lego-style flexibility. The CPU to GPU ratio is intentional because a lot of their customers push data hard through the GPUs, not just VRAM-bound inference. It feels wasteful if your workload is light on CPU, but it simplifies capacity planning and isolation on their side.\n\nYour realistic options are limited. You can look at g5 instances for smaller GPU counts, or split workloads across multiple smaller instances instead of one big box. For training, people sometimes decouple preprocessing onto separate CPU instances and keep GPU nodes as dumb as possible. If you truly want runpod-style flexibility, AWS is the wrong mental model. They sell reliability and integration first, efficiency second.",

Which I guess means in some ways it's a derivation of the (big|little) endiness argument.\n\nThe nicer thing about cf is that it's a bit more predictable (outside of using custom resources, etc) and as long as you're not naming things you can pick it up and deploy it in a similar account for dev or stage, etc. it's concept of \"state\" is the not defined by some file you need to keep track of, it's state is it and it's resources existence. It's also not as clever or fearureful as tf, which when you manage huge amounts of resources in huge amounts of stacks across huge amounts of accounts across modest amounts of departments can be a very very nice thing because you can still fit the concept in your head. And by cf I mean cdk and cf.",

While they are both IaC tools, they are rather different in how they work and view implementation choices. Besides informing about the tech stack next time you interview at a company, there isn't much you can do as even  TFCDK (TF-to-Cfn) is dead at this point. If you are a software engineer, you can use the Cfn CDK, but unless it's some sort of useless checkbox compliance (well, most are) that might not fly.",

It helped us to solve the biggest problem in DevOps space -Stateless IaC.\n\nTerraform has two providers for AWS - aws and awscc. awscc uses cloud control api under the hood which in turn leverages most the stuff from CF excluding stack.\n\nIf you want support for new or updated aws resource types on day 1, you will need awscc which has dependency on CF indirectly as explained above. There have been cases in the past (and it will continue in future as well) where new aws features (e.g. regional NAT gateways) were added to aws provider after weeks when it was available in awscc provider on day 1 through AWS CC API. Unlike terraform, we use only CC API and have not seen any issue with it so far.",
