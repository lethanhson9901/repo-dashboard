Under US law, authorities can compel a provider subject to US jurisdiction to disclose data that is within the provider’s “possession, custody, or control,” even if the data is stored in Europe. Whether this reaches data “handled by an EU subsidiary” often turns on whether the US parent (or another US-jurisdiction entity) has sufficient legal/technical control over that data, and it can create a direct conflict with GDPR rules on responding to foreign orders.\n\nThe key message here is \"possession and control\". What do you think will happen to AWS US if some susidiary manager says \"no\" to their bosses? The only way to circumvent such things at least in parts is to use infrastructure like SAP Delos or Bleu.

      "text": "Hey ,\n\nA month ago, I posted **CloudSlash**, a tool to identify \"zombie\" infrastructure (unused NAT Gateways, detached EBS, Ghost EKS clusters) and i have been updating here on r/aws ever since. This time the entire core engine was rewritten to prioritize Safety. Here is what is new in V2\n\n**1. The Lazarus Protocol (Undo Button)**\n\nIf you choose to delete a resource (like a Security Group), CloudSlash now snapshots the configuration *\\_before\\_* generating the delete command.\n\nIt creates a \"restore.tf\" file containing the exact **Terraform Import blocks** needed to resurrect that resource in its original state. This removes the \"what if I break prod\" anxiety.\n\n**2. Mock Mode**\n\nA lot of you didn't want to give a random GitHub tool read access to your account just to test it. Fair point.\n\nYou can now run \"cloudslash scan --mock\".\n\nIt simulates a messy AWS environment locally so you can see exactly how the detection logic works and what the TUI looks like without touching your real keys or credentials.\n\n**3. Complete TUI Overhaul**\n\n\\- **Topology View:** Visualize dependencies (e.g., Load Balancer -> Listener -> Target Group).\n\n\\- **Interactive Region Picker:** No more hardcoded regions. It fetches enabled regions dynamically.\n\n\\- **Deep Inspection:** Press \"Enter\" on any resource to see the exact cost velocity and provenance (who created it).\n\n**4. Open Sourced Heuristics**\n\nI removed the \"black box\" nature of the detection. The README now contains a full **Heuristics Catalog** detailing the exact math used to flag a resource (e.g., \"RDS is Idle if CPU < 5% for 7 days AND ConnectionCount == 0\"). You can audit the logic before running it.\n\n**5. Graph Engine**\n\n3x faster graph traversal for large accounts ( > 500 resources ) . I refactored the engine to use flat slices instead of maps and implemented string interning for resource types, reducing RAM usage by \\~40% on large graphs.\n\n**Other Improvements since v1.3:**\n\n\\- **Headless Mode:** \"cloudslash scan --headless\" is now fully stable for CI/CD usage.\n\n\\- **Graph Engine:** 3x faster graph traversal for large accounts (>500 resources).\n\n\\- **Completion Scripts:** Native bash/zsh/fish auto-completion.\n\n\\- Validation: Strict tag-based overrides (\"cloudslash:ignore\") are now respected deeper in the graph.\n\n**andd manyyy moreee**\n\n**License:** Still AGPLv3 (Open Source). No paywalls.\n\n\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash](https://github.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash)\n\nbtw parsing AWS graphs is complex, so if you hit any weird edge cases or bugs , please let me know , i plan to fix them immediately\n\nStars are always appreciated :)\n\n:)  DrSkyle",

I was supposed to enroll an external production account into our prod OU through Control Tower,  which has compliance stacksets and some SCPs that get enforced. I thought I had done my homework - went through all the account resources to make sure nothing would get auto-remediated. But somehow I still managed to screw it up because of a silly reason, there were a few resources sitting in regions we don't govern, and they started throwing forbidden errors everywhere after the enrollment. I fixed it by reverting and unenrolling the account, but the whole thing made me disappointed that how I missed this.\n\nThe thing that really gets me is there's no safety net. When I was a software engineer, I always had QA testing my code before anything touched production. Now every infrastructure change feels like I'm walking a tightrope with no net underneath.\n\nI made the switch from software engineering to cloud operations about two years ago, and honestly, incidents like this make me question whether I made the right call.

Focused on reliability and developer experience, I put together a construct library where services have cost-savings, reliability, security, and scalability baked in from the start.\n\nThis is where I want to introduce a phrase I'm calling Infrastructure as Software. The idea is that these constructs, with minimal input, can be stitched together to build fault-tolerant systems. I built this site as a forcing function to showcase what I've been working on, but more importantly it's how an SRE approaches building self-healing infrastructure.\n\nThere's still more to this project, but for now I want to introduce the philosophy of Infrastructure as Software as I continue to illustrate how these constructs work together to build autonomous systems.\n\nWould love to get the community’s input. \n\n[https://github.com/crmagz/cdk-constructs-library](https://github.com/crmagz/cdk-constructs-library)\n\n[https://thepractitioner.cloud/blog/infrastructure-as-software](https://thepractitioner.cloud/blog/infrastructure-as-software)\n\n[https://thepractitioner.cloud/guides/infrastructure-as-software/introduction](https://thepractitioner.cloud/guides/infrastructure-as-software/introduction)\n\n",

Reliability & Hallucination Prevention\nLLM + CLI (The Risk): When an LLM generates a CLI command, it is guessing the syntax based on its training data. If a flag has changed, or if the model \"hallucinates\" a parameter (e.g., inventing a --force-delete flag that doesn't exist), the command fails. You then have to paste the error back to the LLM to debug.  \nAWS MCP (The Solution): The MCP server exposes defined tools to the LLM. The LLM doesn't guess the command; it selects a tool from a list of valid options provided by the server. The MCP server then constructs the correct API call or CLI command under the hood, ensuring syntax accuracy.  \n2. Context Window Efficiency\nLLM + CLI: To get an LLM to understand your infrastructure via CLI, you often have to run aws ec2 describe-instances, copy the massive JSON output, and paste it into the chat. This eats up your context window rapidly with irrelevant noise.\nAWS MCP: MCP servers are \"context-aware.\" They can fetch only the relevant resources (resources) or summarize data before sending it to the LLM. This keeps the conversation focused and prevents the model from \"forgetting\" earlier instructions due to context overflow.  \n3. Security & Guardrails\nLLM + CLI: If you give an LLM access to a terminal (e.g., via a \"bash\" tool), it effectively has the permissions of your local user. It could accidentally delete resources or upload credentials if you aren't watching every character it types.\nAWS MCP:\nLeast Privilege: You can run the MCP server with a specific, restricted AWS profile or role, independent of your main local credentials.  \nSandboxing: MCP servers can verify the \"intent\" of a command before executing it.\nRead-Only Modes: Many MCP implementations allow you to set the server to \"read-only,\" meaning the LLM can look at your S3 buckets but physically cannot execute a delete or put command, regardless of what the prompt says.\n4. Structured Data vs. Text Parsing\nLLM + CLI: CLI output is text. The LLM has to parse whitespace, tables, or raw JSON text. Complex outputs (like CloudWatch logs or deeply nested JSON) are difficult for an LLM to read reliably without formatting errors.\nAWS MCP: The protocol allows the server to pass structured objects directly to the LLM. It acts like an API integration, meaning the LLM receives clean data structures (lists, dictionaries) rather than a wall of text it has to OCR/parse.\n5. Discovery & Up-to-Date Knowledge\nLLM + CLI: The LLM's knowledge of AWS CLI commands is cut off at its training date. It won't know about a new AWS service released last month.\nAWS MCP: The MCP server is a piece of software you update. If AWS releases a new feature and you update your MCP server, the LLM immediately has access to that \"tool\" and its documentation via the protocol, even if the model itself hasn't been retrained.",

          "text": "Lets take step back and ask what a ECS cluster is actually abstracting ?\n\nThe cluster abstracts administrative scope. Specifically, it serves as a boundary for three things like :\n\n1. Security and Permissions (IAM)\n\nA cluster is the easiest place to draw a hard line. It is much simpler to say like junior devs can only see or edit things in cluster B than it is to write complex IAM policies that filter specific services or capacity providers inside a single cluster.\n\n2. Namespace and Service Discovery\n\nServices inside a cluster can easily find each other via Service Connect or Cloud Map. If you put your prod and stage environments in the same cluster, they share the same namespace and separating them into clusters prevents stage app from accidentally talking to a prod database due to a naming collision.\n\n3. Monitoring and Cost Allocation\n\nWhile you can tag individual services, it is much easier to look at a CloudWatch dashboard or a billing report broken down by cluster name. It gives you a clear view of a specific environment without the noise of 50 other unrelated services.\n\nNow lets see when should you actually split into different clusters?\n\nSince you mentioned a single cluster allows you the freedom to do what you want, you are technically correct. You don't have to split them. However, you should consider a split if you hit these scenarios:\n\n\\- If someone accidentally deletes the cluster or misconfigures a cluster-wide setting, does the entire company go dark, or just one department?\n\n\\- If most teams have at least two clusters like prod and non prod. This ensures that testing a new capacity provider setting in staging can't accidentally starve your Production services of resources.\n\n\\- If your healthcare related service needs to be GDPR or HIPPA compliant, it's much easier to put it in its own cluster with its own dedicated ASG and restricted access than to try to prove to an auditor that it’s virtually separated from your other services like data ingestion or some other operational in the same cluster.\n\nI have three cluster running for prod, qa and dev. currently only one API service is running once its scale or add more services then will think to categories them better as per compliance or security need etc.\n\nSimple terms like analogy then think of ECS cluster as shopping mall. ECS services are individual store like Apple store, Nike or Starbucks store. Cluster become mall management office. You could have one big mall that holds every store in the city, or you could have five smaller malls. Both setups get the job done, but the management experience changes, handle compliances and each area demand.",

I'm thinking about applying ABAC to simplify IAM setup in certain cases. For example, imagine that we have an account sandbox-bobaduk, where I have broad access for playing around. We also have an account secret-data where we store some dataset in an S3 bucket.\n\nWe use Google Workspace as our IDP, and I can apply tags to my role session based on attributes. For example, I authenticate as arn:aws:sts::$sandbox-bobaduk:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_MyRole_08759cec7ee3fdc9/bobaduk@org.org. Because I used sso to authenticate, I have the tag `team=data-guy` on my role session.\n\nI can write a resource policy for my s3 bucket that allows GetObject if the OrgId=myorg, and the team tag has the value \"data-guy\".\n\nSo far so good.\n\nMy question, which I'm struggling a little to answer is \"can I trust the provenance of that tag?\".\n\nMy thinking is that I can use an SCP that denies tagging a session with the \"team\" tag, unless the user is adopting a role matching \"AWSReservedSSO_*\". \n\nI should also have an SCP that prevents a user from creating a new role or user with that tag.\n\nthe AWSReservedSSO_* roles can only be created by identity centre, and the trust policy restricts their use to identity centre, so with those SCPs in place, am I missing anything? \n\nI don't need transitive tagging for role chaining, because these tags are _only_ used for this kind of cross-account access based on a resource policy. if I assume another role, I should only have the permissions granted explicitly to that role.",

Having an account for every dev will cost more — this is blatantly untrue. A lot of studies have shown that in general it costs the same or less.  This is because with shared dev accounts there always ends up with orphaned resources that no seems to be able to say who it belongs to. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen an RDS resource left on all the time because “someone might use it” or “the team can’t remember who provisioned it.”\n2. We don’t have enough people to safely vend these accounts — this is a skill problem. You can create AWS accounts via CloudFormation or Terraform today. There’s tons of AWS services and 3P products that provide automated governance at scale AND meet whatever compliance requirements you need. Any lag in the vending process means you have a manual driven culture somewhere that you need to fix.  There’s a lot of studies I’ve seen over the years that shows a correlation between the time it takes to vend and the success someone has in the clouds. If it takes you two weeks to vend an account, you are probably overpaying for the cloud and not taking full advantage of it.\n3. Our developers will be able to spin up whatever they like — this indicate either you don’t have proper governance in place of your cloud environment or you don’t have the proper tools for safe development. Again this is a solved problem by AWS, the OSS community and 3P. You just need to use the tools available.",

A lot of teams overestimate the discovery aspect and underestimate how much sales motion still matters.\n\nThe setups that seemed to help were tight alignment with the field team and using private offers as a way to simplify security and billing conversations. When it worked, it was because Marketplace reduced friction, not because someone randomly found the listing and bought.\n\nIf traction is low, I would treat it as a support channel rather than a growth engine. Useful to have, but probably not worth heavy focus unless you already have deals where buyers specifically want to transact that way.",

Then only you can fail the pipeline when the code does not hit a particular baseline you set, let it be Code Quality (Sonarqube), SAST / DAST etc.\n\nNow, having said that,  I have implemented the other way also, like a Central Pipeline. The way I did is, all the fields are parametrized with fields for example Application ID for that particular application in our scan tool, Packaged Artifact URL for doing Opensource Library Scan, GIT Repo URL for downloading source for SAST ,  Branch to name a few (it has been 5 years so I dont remember most)\n\nThen the application build pipeline will trigger the scanning Job by calling REST API of CI/CD tool with above parameters filled in. Things like Artifact URL, GIT Repo URL etc would be already available as environment variables. But application ID for Scanning tool, i had to set it manually as a parameter for each pipeline (Devs will fill it, and I just had to give the template)\n\nAPI key for your Scanning tool would be most probably global key. This key can be stored as a variable in the central pipeline itself\n\nI have scaled both the above models for 1000+ pipelines. Works well, but I strongly suggest you to keep these scans and Quality gates as part of the actual build pipeline itself. It can go in parallel with rest of the stages not affecting deployment times. Because at some point, you would want to break the pipelines when code quality goes south.",

If we do create one it is up to us to make sure it works for everyone which is a burden we rather not take on. \n\nSo we decided to decouple enforcement from scanning. In github we can create rulesets that require certain scanning tools to have checked the repository before a PR can be merged. We use this for enforcement while providing pipeline templates and private github actions to help implementation of scanning tools. \n\nThis makes it easier to start enforcement while not being a burden because teams can do their own implementation if ours don’t work. \n\nFor scanning tools that dont integrate with github rulesets checks we have created our own tool to check if the scanning is sufficient.",

AWS acknowledged the issue and escalated it for service-team review and possible billing adjustment.\n\nWhile this review was still ongoing, and despite requesting temporary billing hold during the investigation, the account was suspended for non-payment. We’re now unable to log in to the console, which has taken production applications offline and blocked access to CloudWatch and infrastructure management.\n\nAt this point, we’re trying to understand the correct escalation path.

          "text": "That sounds brutal, and sadly I have seen variations of this before. Once an account is fully suspended, normal support cases tend to stall because billing enforcement is automated and not tightly coupled to ongoing reviews. What helped in one case was getting the account manager or TAM involved, even if they were only loosely attached before. If you do not have one, pushing hard through the billing escalation form and explicitly stating production impact sometimes triggers a different internal queue. It is also worth asking for temporary read-only console access so you can at least validate state and exports. The big lesson I took from this is that billing disputes and security incidents often move on totally different tracks internally, and they do not always talk to each other fast enough.",

The result is the same - the console, CF, and terraform, all use the same APIs.\n\nIf you want control, you have to do just as much work to do to prevent console meddling.\n\nDrift detection? TF can do that. State? You can put the state in an S3 bucket with strong controls on it.\n\nAll the attitudes preferring CloudFormation to Terraform I've seen ... seem to be rooted in dislike for the idea of programming. The only advantages CF has over TF in my book are that you have a prebuilt IaC setup, and lots of code samples. The rest ... CF is hard to grow, hard to refactor, and a PITA to modularize. And slow, because dependency graphs in CF treat stacks as an entire atomic unit, you can't update anything with an input that depends on an output until the whole stack is done.",

There is some real shit out there. It's like the little tikes learning kit for iac. In some ways it's the new perl vs python argument of \"there's more than one way to do it\" in perl vs \"there's only one way to do it\" in Python. Which I guess means in some ways it's a derivation of the (big|little) endiness argument.\n\nThe nicer thing about cf is that it's a bit more predictable (outside of using custom resources, etc) and as long as you're not naming things you can pick it up and deploy it in a similar account for dev or stage, etc. it's concept of \"state\" is the not defined by some file you need to keep track of, it's state is it and it's resources existence. It's also not as clever or fearureful as tf, which when you manage huge amounts of resources in huge amounts of stacks across huge amounts of accounts across modest amounts of departments can be a very very nice thing because you can still fit the concept in your head.

(versions were not pinned)\n\nA breaking change in the pip versions of boto3 and botocore caused compatibility issues with the awscli version from Debian 11’s apt. To resolve this, I updated the launch template to install awscli from the official zip:\n\n[https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86\\_64.zip](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip)\n\nNow, testing upgrading to Debian 13, global pip installs are blocked (error: externally-managed-environment), and venv is recommended.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWould it be best to move boto3 and botocore installation to the EC2 launch template, using apt:\n\n/usr/bin/apt-get install awscli python3-boto3 python3-botocore --assume-yes\n\nThis should ensure compatibility between all three packages. Any downsides or better approaches?",
