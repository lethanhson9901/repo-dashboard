But if the data is say a customer workload, now I need to move data out of AWS to MacStadium. I need to add them as a subproccessor. I need to assure their compliance, etc etc etc. It might be dollarwise much cheaper, but the workload required to support it might be a non-starter.\n\nIf you have an office, just buy the machines and put them in a closet.

If you're running 24x7x30, it certainly doesn't make sense. You can literally buy a new mac each month for the same cost. But that being said, you're stuck with a minimum of 24 hours, which for an M4 Metal is roughly $30/day (on demand).

Moreover, they're bog standard consumer mac minis: full metal enclosures and all, without any cloud-adapted modifications. That means they're horribly inefficient space and compute-wise compared to average datacenter compute racks and clusters.

Backend SDK\n\nGen 1 was heavily opinionated, bound to its CLI, and had unclear boundaries with how interfaced with existing IaC. 90% of pain and strife associated to Amplify in general can be attributed here. \n\nGen 2 fixes many these issues and create clear separation of boundaries between your existing infra as it’s largely based on CDK. \n\nIf you are mostly running lambda backends or need to support older Next.js versions, I’d consider it safe to use\n\nThat said, amplify wouldn’t be my first choice.\n\nI strongly believe sticking to containers simplifies life for everyone, especially when ECS Express Mode or App Runner exist.",

A few examples of why I find it problematic. \n\n\\* It doesn't have any real state management so if someone changes something outside cloudformation, it won't pick up that change when you run the stack, no warning just silently ignore unless it conflicts and the whole stack will fail.\n\n\\* It treats the whole stack as a single entity so it'll deploy all or nothing.  Some consider this a pro, most just find it annoying because say for example you mistype a security group id you're referencing.  Instead of refusing to create the resource that relies on that group so you can quickly fix it, you need to wait for it to rollback (remove all changes in that stack, get to a good state (UPDATE\\_ROLLBACK\\_COMPLETE) and then you can try again.  That means depending on your stack size, it could take over an hour to fix that simple problem.\n\n\\* It can be difficult to figure out what actually went wrong during stack creation and depending on the state it ends up in, can be difficult to fix and sometimes require you to delete the stack and redeploy.  Another fun feature is the first time you deploy a stack, if it errors out, you have to delete the stack manually.\n\n\\* Some strange behaviors that aren't well documented.  Example: when changing a db subnet group, you remove subnets 1234 and 5678 and add 1919.  It will add 1919 but fail to delete the other 2 even if nothing is using them.\n\nI'm sure others will give many more examples.",

Cloudflare, etc.  Amazon's ability to guarantee a DNS control plane failover in under an hour is unique and a step up above anyone else.   Remember, this isn't a region redundancy, R53 is any cast globally.  This is so if the R53 control plane has issues, you can fail over to a secondary control plane of R53.",

What latency numbers do you see across containers? Could there be some easy fixes to lower this number?\n\nUnfortunately it's very hard to drive change in a big organization, for example one could try to use placement groups but the related ticket has now been blocked for 2 years already, so I would like to hear how would you tackle this problem, supposing that it's a problem that could somehow be solved.",

Plain HTTP will be faster (or HTTP to a local envoy proxy which then maintains TLS connections to the adjacent nodes).  Client side load balancing will be faster instead of load balancers.  Are you making cross-az calls?  I've seen customers deploy cross AZ, merge all the performance data, and chase variable response times.\n\nYou can create two Fargate containers in the same AZ and exposes a HTTP service between them and the response time will be <1ms.",

Load balancers increase latency, especially if they are L7 (ALB) or add TLS.\n\nIf you don’t, I would recommend adding distributed tracing and per-route latency / throughput metrics would be helpful.

So for those, letting them keep some or all of the tools is the right plan, even economically, because incidents cost real money.\n\nI tend to think a standard one size fits all pattern is not wise if you actually want to be reasonably frugal - because time spent on incidents costs a lot, and this can quickly overwhelm your savings on paper.  \n\nAlso important is log retention timeline - even glacier costs more than zero. If you don't need the logs, delete them, don't just automatically downgrade their retention.  Getting the app owners to state plainly and simply what their needs are (and the business why) lets you bucket the log SLA sanely.\n\nIt's better to have a flowchart than a one size fits all rule IMO.",

I have 12+ years of experience in cloud and enterprise architecture and I am preparing for a Senior Solutions Architect (L6) role at AWS (also considering MSFT).\n\nI previously went through an AWS loop and received feedback that one poorly handled question impacted my overall evaluation. This time, I want to be extremely well-prepared.\n\nMy current prep:\n\n* Building 15–20 strong Leadership Principle stories (deep dives, metrics, trade-offs)\n* Heavy focus on AWS-centric system design (and generic SWE design)\n* Reviewing SA-level customer scenarios, trade-offs, and failure stories\n\nI am looking for:\n\n* Mock interview partners (LPs and/or system design)\n* Recommendations for AI-based interview prep tools or platforms that allow repeated practice\n* Any advice from people who’ve cleared AWS L6 SA loops\n\nHappy to exchange mock interviews or pay for quality sessions. Thanks in advance!",

Whatever your answer, you have no idea of all the expertise of the interviewer so never fake it. You know the answer or not. You can be very sure they know AWS.\n\nWhen answering in STAR, you always, always end with a data driven conclusion (time saved, $ saved, new sales, new revenue) or a cross team process improvement. Estimate or use a little poetic license. \n\nDoing your job is not diving deep nor is it learn and be curious nor is it bias for action, etc. They are looking for times you went above and beyond or outside your area.",

(The overall SA interview structure is consistent between levels; they just have higher expectations for the higher level roles in regards to technical skill, scope of work, and scope of influence.)\n\nTo be clear, their prep materials are around the LP's, but there's not much you can do to prep for the tech parts of the loop; either you know the answers or you don't.\n\nI bought their main interview prep course, and also paid for their Job Description review, which provides a list of likely LP's so you aren't prepping for ones you don't need. I did not purchase their 1-on-1 coaching, or bother with AI Story analysis, but those are products they offer.\n\nThey also have a very-informative [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@amazoninterviewwhizzdayone503) channel with a ton of good content on it, and have a free live Q&A every Monday. (Their YouTube channel is horribly-named, but it's good stuff.)\n\nFor my LP's, I think I had about 45 pages of typed-up stories. (I didn't actually need to refer to my notes during my interview, but I did have a quick-reference-table that I used several times just to remind me of what was in my list of stories.) And I'm sure you know this, but you want to avoid re-using the same story more than once if you can at-all help it.\n\nThe one question that almost got me rejected during phone screen was \"What would you have done better if you had to do it all over again?\" in reference to the flagship project on my CV. That one kind of startled me, because it was in regards to a project I did that was a complete success; innovative, on-time, on-budget, profitable, and repeatable for other customers.",

      "text": "Hello AWS community! \n\nI've found myself in a situation where I'm moving accounts from one Organization to another Organization. In this instance, the source organization is much smaller but heavily uses LZA to deploy their accounts and resources but the target Organization is not currently utilizing LZA. I've mapped out the SCPs, resource shares, Control Tower guardrails, and have made migration plans for moving those resources and accounts into separate OUs to try and logically keep the source accounts in a relatively similar state but LZA stumps me. \n\nI've read through so much of the documentation of LZA but I can't seem to find any sort of path for specifically moving into another Organization. Is it possible to migrate the accounts and pipeline into the target Organization and update the LZA resources with the target organization's OUs, management accounts, and OUs without rollback of the resources? \n\nI've set up Control Tower on the target organization to deploy the same guard rails and I'm going to look to recreate SCPs (from the source organization) in the target organization. My original game plan for account migration was:\n\n1. Unenroll account from source Control Tower and allow the guardrails to be removed\n2. Migrate the account into the target organization into a recreated OU structure without enabling in Control Tower\n3. Clean/Update the Control Tower roles/permissions (AWSControlTowerExecution) in the account to point to the target Organization\n4. Enroll the account in target Organization's Control Tower and allow the guard rails and SCPs to be redeployed\n\nIf I'm understanding LZA correctly, the resources deployed from LZA should not roll back unless the pipeline runs. Is that correct? \n\nWould I be able to update the pipeline's YAML files to reflect the new OUs and management account then run the pipeline to allow it fix itself? I found that I could flag OUs and accounts as 'Ignored' so LZA would ignore any accounts not in the target organization's new OU structure since I don't want to utilize LZA outside of the OUs that I'll be creating/recreating for the migration.\n\nWould it be easier to just uninstall LZA, do the migration, then look to reinstall LZA on the pipeline account? I suppose this method would allow me to update to a newer version of LZA but I'm not sure if that would remove LZA deployed resources. \n\nAny thoughts or considerations will be greatly appreciated! Both organizations are running production workloads so I'm making sure to do my due diligence and have been poring through whitepapers but there isn't much on moving a LZA deployment. I know the tool is loved (and hated) throughout the community so I'm hoping to utilize it in the future but first I need to get the accounts migrated over. ",

LZA cross-org migration isn't documented because it's not a supported pattern. you're in custom territory",

If there is something for me to do to apply this credit, it's not clear from the Management Console. \n\nThe reason I'm asking is because in the past I've always had to enter in a code to apply credits. I'm just not familiar enough with this process. Thank you for the sanity check.",
