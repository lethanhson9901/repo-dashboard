      "text": "Every AWS cost optimization post says the same thing: \"tag your resources, use Cost Allocation Tags.\" Great advice, very helpful, thanks.\n\nBut after 18 months of cleaning up a pretty messy AWS setup I realized that having tags is not the hard part. The hard part is having the right tags in a structure that actually tells you something useful. We went from \"yeah we tag stuff\" to genuinely understanding our spend down to the feature level, and the difference is night and day.\n\nHere's what worked for us.\n\n**Three mandatory tags, everything else optional**\n\nWe use exactly three required tags on every resource:\n\n* **Environment**: prod, staging, dev and sandbox. Obvious but you'd be surprised how many things don't have this.\n* **Service**: this is YOUR service, not the AWS service. So not \"RDS\" but \"payment-processor\" or \"user-api\" or \"data-pipeline\". This is the one that matters most.\n* **Team**: who owns this when it breaks at 2am. Also who gets asked when the cost spikes.\n\nThe key insight for us was Service. We used to tag by AWS product type which told us basically nothing we didn't allready know from Cost Explorer. Once we started tagging by our own service names, everything changed. A single Service:payment-processor tag now spans the ALB, the ECS tasks, the RDS cluster, the SQS queues. I can see what it actually costs to run payments across all infrastructure, not just what individual resources cost in isolation.\n\n**Why only three**\n\nWe started with 12 required tags. Compliance was maybe 40% at best. People just didn't bother or tagged inconsistently. Dropped to 3 mandatory + 5 optional and we're at around 95% now. Turns out people will actually do it if you keep it simple.\n\n**Enforce tagging at creation, not with angry Slack messages**\n\nThis was probably our biggest lesson. We handle this on two levels now:\n\n1. We use OPA policies with Terraform now (see picture). If a resource doesn't have the three mandatory tags, the apply just fails. No exceptions, no \"I'll add it later\". Retroactive tagging is a nightmare and honestly a waste of everyones time.\n2. At the AWS Organization level with SCPs, they block the creation of resources that don’t include those tags. This covers cases where someone spins up resources manually in the console, through the CLI or SDK, outside of terraform.\n\nWe spent almost two weeks tagging old resources manually before we accepted it would have been cheaper to just let them expire and recreate them properly. If you're early enough, enforce from day one. If you're late, don't try to fix everything, just enforce going forward and let the old stuff cycle out.\n\n**The report that actually gets read**\n\nWe have a simple monthly report that flags any service where cost went up more than 30% month over month. The catch is this only works if tagging is consistent, which is why enforcement matters so much.\n\nWhen payment-processor jumps from $800 to $2,400, thats a conversation worth having. And it’s a very different conversation than \"our EC2 bill went up\". Finance doesn't care about EC2 vs Lambda. They want to know what business capability costs what and whether the increase makes sense. \"The recommendation engine doubled because we shipped a new model\" is an answer people can actually work with.\n\n**The unsolved problem: shared infrastructure**\n\nThe one thing we still don't have a clean answer for is shared resources. Databases that serve multiple services, shared Redis clusters, that kind of thing. Right now we tag those with the primary consumer and accept it’s not perfectly accurate. Looked into split cost allocation tags but honestly it felt like over-engineering for our size.\n\nCurious how others handle this. Anyone have a tagging strategy that actually survived contact with reality? Especially for shared infrastructure.",

          "text": "IMHO, while tags can be helpful its not the end all be all, specifically because of the issues you called out at the end: shared \"stuff\".\n\nInstead of trying to use tags and assigning ownership that way, I massively prefer to separate everything by account.\n\nYou bring up Environment, Service and Team as ways that you want to enforce control. This is backwards from my preference.\n\nTeams are the top level of ownership and accountability. AWS accounts should be owned by a single team. What happens in those accounts is the responsibility of the owning team.\n\nServices should be owned by a single team, and they should run in accounts owned by those teams.\n\nStages (Dev/Test/Prod) are how Services are deployed. Each stage of a service should have its own account. This makes sure that someone whacking an IAM role in your devo environment doesn't somehow impact your Prod envionment which is (stupidly) running  in that same account.\n\nI'd add that regional distribution is another thing that should also be happening in their own accounts. So your NA prod environment for Service A is in a different account than the EU prod environment for ServiceA.\n\nBreak your infra up by accounts and make one team the operational and financial owner of each account. Then when you (the FinOps person) get a billing alert for an account (or the security team gets an alert for someting), you know exactly who to reach out to and everyone should already understand and agree with how responsibility is distributed.\n\nTeams are free to use tags in their own accounts however they like (or not use them), it doesn't matter to the bigger organization or company.",

I do cloud strategy & lots of FinOps and have come to the same conclusion.\n\nYou need separate accounts anyway for different environments, as you say, and mostly you can group accounts by specific application/service. Accounts attach to dedicated network accounts with shared VPCs.\n\nThen @OP to answer your question, there will be accounts with shared resources. Whether those are things like foundations / network / observability or large shared databases like BQ.\n\nThe way I approach those is to sort those accounts descending by $ spend and work with the platform teams involved to come up with an allocation methodology. You might “peanut butter” spread core foundational infrastructure like VPCs or even observability, basically assign a % of the cost to applications based on their % of total directly attributable spend and therefore a “probably accurate” but imprecise mechanism.\n\nBut I’ve also done ‘shared platforms’ like container platforms or shared large databases where you need to ensure there’s a proper intake associating container apps or DB tables with cost centers or applications. You can then pull operational data like # of x-sized container hours per month as a % of total x-sized container hours to build allocation ratios.\n\nIt gets pretty granular, which is why it is critical to:\n\n1. Start with the most expensive shared accounts and continue descending; and\n2. Make the account owner (I.e. shred platform team) accountable for the spend until that account’s spend can be allocated to “customers” effectively.\n\nYou’ll never hit every single account, but if you do this, the 80/20 rule will help you attribute / allocate the majority of spend with a reasonable output of effort.",

Then insist on per-service/team metrics (if necessary, custom cloudwatch, but log aggregating works probably pretty well) with a naming scheme that lets you tie them together with the tags, to provide more granular insight.

I would just create a {pk TENANT#<tenant-id>, sk:METADATA} for each tenant, that has a property TYPE=TENANT and use a GSI to query for the type, to get a full tenant list or something similiar. But would be more worried, that your general pk/sk design leads to hot partitioning, since your pk is always the tenant id, and the pk determines the partition. What I do is, to break it down into subcategories. like {pk: TENANT#<tenant-id>#USER, sk: <user-id>} or {pk: TENANT#<tenant-id>#PROJECT, sk: <project-id>}. That would be already two distinct paritition, instead of a single one by just using the pattern {pk: TENANT#<tenant-id>, sk: PROJECT#<project-id>}, where all items for that tenant compete for the same 1,000 WCU / 3,000 RCU per-partition throughput limit. That works also well for me, since i usually have dedicated api routes for subcategories. What is your security model to enforce tenant isolation?",

              "text": "Great points — here's my thinking:\n\nTenant index isn't really a worry because it's an admin operation with low volume. I've handled this with the TENANT\\_LIST GSI, but your TYPE=TENANT approach seems functionally similar.\n\nSplitting PKs into subcategories is an interesting approach - you spread writes across multiple partitions with the tradeoff that you lose the ability to read across entity types in a single operation. I think this really depends on the access patterns. For the multi-tenant case, being able to query \\`TENANT#<id>\\` and get metadata + subscription + users in one call is something I reach for a lot.  \nFor most SaaS apps, from what I understand, the hot partition concern is overblown - 1,000 WCU per partition is a lot, and since 2018 DynamoDB's adaptive capacity redistributes throughput to handle hot partitions without you needing to intervene. It won't proactively split them, but it handles the imbalance. If you're at a scale where a single tenant is consistently pushing past that, you probably have bigger architectural decisions to make anyway.\n\nThe tenant isolation point is legit and something I should address in the article. In my production apps I handle this at the application layer (tRPC + OpenAuth — every query is scoped to the authenticated tenant). I'm aware of IAM fine-grained access control with \\`dynamodb:LeadingKeys\\` condition keys as the DB-level option, but haven't needed it yet. Have you had success with that approach in practice, or is there something else you'd recommend?",

So basically, I make sure that the relevant data (tenant id, role, etc) is part of the signed access token, like you do. I have predefined IAM roles with role tags, using the LeadingKeys pattern, and at the API level, the actual dynamodb requests are being done while assuming those roles. This will enforce tenant isolation. But I also have more RBAC/ABAC style of permissions enforced at the middleware level. For all that I build an universal authentication and authorisation system I deploy once (or as often as I want to get more isolation for other reasons)  and can reuse for any other app. It's just plug and play at this point. But was a lot of work to get there. But at the moment I'm still doing REST APIs. Which works nicely, because I'm running Hono with OpenAPI extension, where I only have to define a zod schema as single source of truth, and can easily generate the correctly typed client code via the OpenAPI specs, it automatically generates from that.

              "text": "It's a valid approach and some teams do this — especially when you need hard isolation for compliance (HIPAA, SOC2) or you want to offer dedicated-tenancy as a premium tier.\n\nThe tradeoffs though:\n\n\\- Operational overhead scales linearly - Every new tenant means a new table, new GSIs, new CloudWatch alarms, new backup configs. At 100 tenants that's manageable. At 10,000 it's a nightmare.  \n\\- Cross-tenant queries become expensive - \"List all tenants\" or \"aggregate usage across tenants\" requires scanning every table.  \n\\- AWS account limits - There's a default limit of 2,500 tables per account per region. You can request increases, but it's a signal you're fighting the grain.  \n\\- Cost - Each table with on-demand pricing has its own minimum throughput allocation. One shared table is cheaper than N separate ones.\n\nThe single-table approach gives you logical isolation (tenant-scoped partition keys) with the operational simplicity of one table. If you need stronger isolation, the IAM LeadingKeys approach another commenter mentioned gives you DB-level enforcement without separate tables.\n\nThat said, table-per-tenant is the right call for some use cases — particularly when tenants have wildly different scale or strict data residency requirements. It's not wrong, just different tradeoffs.",

              "text": "Good question - this is one of the genuine pain points with DynamoDB, and one that kept me sticking to rdbms for a very long time. \n\nFor attribute-level changes (adding a new field, changing a default), it's straightforward - DynamoDB is schemaless per item, so new items get the new attribute and old items don't. I handle backfills lazily at read time or with a one-off migration script depending on whether the field is required.\n\nFor key structure changes (modifying a PK/SK pattern or GSI), it's more involved. You can't alter keys on existing items - you have to write new items with the new key pattern and clean up the old ones. ElectroDB's versioning helps here: you define a new entity version and can read both old and new formats during the transition.\n\nFor GSI changes, adding a new GSI is non-disruptive (DynamoDB backfills it from the existing table). Changing or removing one requires a migration plan.\n\nHonestly, this is probably the strongest argument against overly complex single-table designs - the more entities and overloaded indexes you have, the harder migrations get. It's why I'd rather start with clean, well-separated key prefixes and only overload GSIs when the access patterns are stable.\n\nSchema migration tooling is a big gap in the DynamoDB ecosystem right now. It's something I'm thinking about for singletable.dev down the road.",

I use single-table design in production and I'm building a tool around it, but there are real situations where it's the wrong call.\n\nThe cases where you shouldn't reach for it:\n\n* Access patterns are still changing (pre-PMF products)\n* No DynamoDB champion on the team - works great until that person leaves\n* Significant reporting or analytics requirements\n* Fewer than 6 access patterns (just use multi-table, it's fine)\n* Multiple teams or bounded contexts sharing the same deployment\n* Per-entity DynamoDB Streams processing (you get one stream per table, not per entity type)\n\nThe \"disaster\" pattern I keep seeing isn't single-table being wrong - it's teams starting with key design before listing access patterns. You design the table to serve access patterns, not the other way around.\n\nFull post covers: the decision framework table, the microservices/team ownership case (probably the most underrated reason to avoid it), and what I actually use for [rasika.life](http://rasika.life) vs what I'd use for a prototype.\n\n→ [https://singletable.dev/blog/when-not-to-use-single-table-design](https://singletable.dev/blog/when-not-to-use-single-table-design)\n\nCurious what situations have pushed your teams away from it - or toward it despite the complexity.",

The number of tables doesn't change that. I'll fix the framing.\n\nOn the access pattern count - also a fair correction. The \"6 access patterns\" heuristic is too blunt. What I was trying to capture is the case where your data relationships are simple enough that the cognitive overhead of single-table design isn't justified - but you're right that the real signal isn't the count, it's whether your access patterns require traversing relationships within a partition. One access pattern that pulls a full aggregate by partition key is a completely legitimate use of single-table design.

In our case it was an event store, a production database and a (complex) configuration store. Mixing all of this is an absolutely horrible idea, because the different areas have vastly different requirements and change rates.\n\nScanning the table becomes impossible. This might not matter for day-to-day operations, but if every migration takes a week and is hugely expensive that is a problem and you become very inflexible.\n\nAnd always put an expiry on the data. Because deleting data by scanning the table is just so expensive that is makes more sense to create a new table and drop the old one (which is a stressful thing to do if your backup will take ages to reconstruct the table ;).\n\nThe risk in having more tables is also smaller. In that case you can only mess up one area of the data. So only do single table if you know exactly what you are doing. Merging multiple tables into one is easier than the other way around.",

An event store and a production database have almost nothing in common operationally. That's not a single-table design problem, that's a data modeling problem that single-table made worse.\n\nThe DDD aggregate framing is actually the clearest heuristic I've heard for where the boundary should be. One aggregate (or tightly related aggregates that are always queried together) per table makes the access patterns predictable and keeps migrations scoped. The moment you're mixing things that evolve independently - your config store vs. your event store - you've lost the main benefit and kept all the costs.\n\nThe TTL point is underrated. Designing for data expiry from day one changes how you think about the whole model. \"How does this data leave the table?\" should be in the access patterns list from the start.\n\nGoing to add the aggregate boundary heuristic to the post - it's a more actionable framing than what I had.",

If you understand that in advance, understand how to make the tool work for you and not against you, then DDB is your friend. And it might be 'schema-less', but I want to see you change relational schemas back and forth and not complain about the consequences :D. There is always a schema, a logic, a model, just that it is not explicitly defined and enforced at the DB level like it would be with a relational db. And schema definition for a relational db or data in general can be a lot of work.  It requires a lot of discipline to work it out and to keep it consistent in the long run. Having a good model/schema of your data, is to understand the data. And once you get there, you can also understand the access patterns better. So for me, modelling the data is always the very first step. Every mistake you make in that process will always result in plenty of pain and work. For DDB even more so. ",

Day job is building [rasika.life](https://rasika.life) (a Carnatic music platform) where DynamoDB is the primary datastore — so this isn't theoretical for me, it's the system I'm maintaining.\n\nOn RDS: yes, reasonably deep. I've built on Postgres for years and it's my default for anything with complex reporting, evolving schemas, or strong relational requirements — which is basically why it made the \"when to avoid single-table\" list. DocumentDB I've touched but wouldn't claim expertise.\n\nThe honest answer is that I get deep in DynamoDB specifically because I made the choice to build on it and had to live with the consequences.

          "text": "Wall of text incoming; tl;dr: balance your efforts with the realities of time and money. Don't invest too early in things that don't help you prove product market fit. Do invest in things that let you iterate quickly without digging a deep tech debt hole, as being able to deliver changes reliably and quickly lets you get to that product market fit faster.  \n  \nThere is a balance to be had. As a startup there's a few things that really matter. Acquiring/validating product market fit, and the length of your runway (cash on hand / cost per month to run the business = runway in months) are the two that come to mind with this question.\n\nIt's very easy to do things well enough. It's also very easy to make a completely unmaintainable and overpriced mess. What you don't want to do is spend a month making things better than well enough only to launch a product that has no market or can't find it's feet in the market, even if one exists. This shortens your effective runway to solve those problems.\n\nPlatform/tech/infra/arch serve the operations and maintainability of a software product and business. It means nothing if you don't have a product. If what you are doing today is \\*honestly\\* getting in the way of delivering a product (reducing your runway to have a successful (growing) product) or costing too much money (again, increasing burn rate and reducing runway, or too much time due to inconsistency/bad dev flow/whatever) so that you won't hit your deadlines with adequate reserves, then it sounds like there is a business decision to made to solve those pain points.\n\nInvestment in platform is a business decision. You are limited by time and money. Any of those you spend on platform are not being spent on product. Yes, there are tradeoffs - if you don't spend enough time/money on solid foundations, you'll probably have a less reliable product. There's not a magic bullet here, you must evaluate your honest business needs and make a decision based on the facts at hand.\n\nIf you hit product market fit, you have a good problem on your hands. In theory, this means revenue that lowers your burn rate increasing your runway, or more opportunity for investment for more capital which increases your runway, both of which give you more options to get resourcing on stability/scalability/efficiency that you caused by not prematurely spending time on whatever that bottleneck is.\n\nAs an platform decision maker myself, 90% of what I do doesn't matter pre product launch. Make sure we're using IAC that's fast to iterate on, make sure we're documenting decisions, make sure we have reasonable deployment pipelines that are consistent, boring, and reliable, and have any choice for observability and alerting. That's the most I would care about pre launch. Post launch once running a live service, that's a whole different ball game. But, if I've got those 4 things in place we have consistency in provisioning, in deployment, we aren't blind, and we have documented business context. That's a solid foundation for working through operational challenges and pushing for reliability. And you don't need all of them right away. o11y can get expensive fast, for example.\n\nLastly, check with your AWS account rep about AWS startup credits or other programs you can get into. Your infra costs sound way too high for a pre-launch early stage startup, they often give credits for adopting new services and things like that. Depending on your level of support, you may be able to get some help from an aws solutions architect or similar to help manage those costs, though that typically comes with the super pricey stuff.",

My current company uses AWS but most of my work is maintaining what someone else built. I understand how the services work individually but I struggle when asked to design something from scratch.\n\nI have been trying to improve. I go through AWS documentation, watch re:Invent videos, use A Cloud Guru for structured learning and work through small projects to practice IaC code. I use Claude and beyz coding assistant when I am writing Terraform or CDK to make sure my logic makes sense and I am not missing obvious mistakes. I have also started reading through the AWS Well-Architected Framework to understand how AWS recommends thinking about these decisions.\n\nMy problem is I can follow a tutorial but I cannot make architecture trade-offs on my own. When I try to apply it to a real scenario I get stuck. When someone asks why I chose a specific service over another or how I would balance cost versus performance versus operational complexity I do not have a good answer beyond what I read in a blog post. I know the tools exist but I do not know when to pick one over the other.\n\nFor those who went from working with AWS to actually designing AWS solutions, how did you build that intuition for trade-offs? Did you just keep doing practice designs until it clicked or is there a better way to learn the reasoning behind architecture decisions?",

For API's serving users, I prefer traditional containers as they can keep multiple endpoints warm. Sure you can do that with Lambda too if you configuring API gateway to point multiple API endpoints to a single provisioned \"Lambdaton\". But at that point, wouldn't you like a service that is easier to develop and test locally? Etc etc.\n\nAnd for pricing, you can use the AWS cost calculator and test some scenarios. How does ECS on Fargate compare to ECS on EC2? You'll find out EC2 is cheaper, but does that mean it's better? How does the operational overhead cost compare? And is the (potential) cost saved worth the operational risk?\n\nIt all depends on context.",

But what have you learned other than how to follow a recipe? If you start with no recipe, only a vague knowledge of which ingredients you need, you'll probably get it wrong at first. But then you'll adjust and iterate and learn from the experience.\n\nEmbrace mistakes. Don't avoid them.\n\nCaveat: with any cloud provider, mistakes can be costly! Always, always, always understand how much a service is going to cost before you use it, then clean up anything you aren't using.",

By the time the whole process finishes usage has already changed and the analysis is outdated.\n\nCommitment recommendations in cost explorer are okay as a starting point but they don't account for upcoming projects, seasonal traffic patterns or planned architecture changes. They just look at historical usage and say \"buy this much\" which is often wrong.\n\nUnder committing means leaving savings on the table, over-committing means paying for capacity you don't use and the optimal middle ground requires constant adjustment. Three year commitments save more but lock you in longer which is risky for startups where everything changes constantly.\n\nCoverage percentage drops randomly when workloads shift and you need to evaluate whether to buy more which savings plan type makes sense (compute vs ec2) and what term length is appropriate. Feels like this should be automated somehow but I haven't found anything that actually works reliably\n\nIs there a good workflow for this or is manual quarterly analysis just the reality?",

Its covering your stable floor and leaving the variable portion on-demand. Trying to optimize the last 5-10% of coverage is where most of the analysis time goes and the savings are marginal.\n\nPractical workflow that replaced quarterly analysis for me:\n\n1. Pull your last 90 days of on-demand spend from Cost Explorer. Look at the MINIMUM daily spend, not the average. Thats your floor.\n\n```\naws ce get-cost-and-usage \\\n  --time-period Start=2025-11-21,End=2026-02-21 \\\n  --granularity DAILY \\\n  --metrics UnblendedCost \\\n  --filter '{\"Dimensions\":{\"Key\":\"PURCHASE_TYPE\",\"Values\":[\"\"]}}' \\\n  --query 'ResultsByTime[].{Date:TimePeriod.Start,Cost:Total.UnblendedCost.Amount}'\n```\n\n2. Buy 1-year no-upfront Compute SPs to cover ~70-80% of that floor. Not 95%. Compute SPs because they flex across instance families, regions, and even Lambda/Fargate. If you migrate from m5 to m7g next quarter it still applies.\n\n3. Revisit every 6 months, not quarterly. If your floor shifted significantly, top up. If not, dont touch it.\n\nThe reason quarterly feels like a treadmill is because youre re-analyzing the variable portion that changes constantly. Ignore it. Let it stay on-demand. The floor is what matters and it barely moves for most workloads.\n\nOn the 3-year commitment question. I wouldnt do it at a startup. The extra discount over 1-year is maybe 10-15% more savings but you lose all flexibility. One architecture change and youre stuck paying for capacity you dont use. 1-year no-upfront gives you 30-40% discount with an exit every 12 months.",

It's sort of a rite of passage with DynamoDB.\n\nDynamoDB is, as you know, very different from relational databases. With DynamoDB it is imperative that you fully understand all of your access patterns ahead of time, then model the table accordingly. If your access patterns change, then you may need to remodel your table.\n\nWith relational databases, you don't need to fully understand the access patterns ahead of time. It helps to know your access patterns ahead of time, but relational databases are flexible and adaptable.\n\nYou can do what you want with DynamoDB, but the table in its current form wasn't designed to support this \"bulk delete\" access pattern.\n\nI think you're at a point where you need to do a bit of redesign. Some of the other comments have practical solutions that may be helpful.",

          "text": "I had a somewhat similar problem, where DynamoDB would collect millions of transactions, and at some point in time all transactions (within a Partition Key set) older than a particular timestamp needed to be deleted/invalidated/ignored as a whole. That timestamp was not known in advance - it depended on a user action - so I could not use the TTL mechanism. Like you noticed, there is no way to do that directly in a consistent manner.\n\nSome of the other proposals, where you update each item with a deleted=true or other attribute, suffer from the same problem: You need to either update or delete a large number of items in bulk, and the bulk operations in the DynamoDB are simply too limited in the number of items they can handle in one go, and in an atomic way.\n\nIn my case, my transactions fortunately were timestamped, and the transactions that needed to be deleted from the table were all done before a particular timestamp - the time of that user action. So I added an additional table \"DeleteMarkers\". As soon as the user event happened, I entered the timestamp of the Delete event into the DeleteMarkers, with the same partition key as the transaction table. Now, instead of doing one query to the TransactionsTable, I had to do two queries:\n\n1. Query to the DeleteMarkers table to get the up-to-date DeleteMarker\n2. Query to the TransactionTable to get the transactions, with the limitation that the results returned should be newer than the DeleteMarker.\n\nDynamoDB is quick enough that the additional query time did not impact latency.\n\nAfter this, I could delete the old transactions from the TransactionTable in the background. I used the TTL mechanism for that, but you can also do a query or even a scan if you want to. This is not time-critical or transaction-critical anymore.\n\nFrom a design point of view, DeleteMarkers has the SessionID as my Partition Key, no Sort Key (so when queried it returns one item only), and a field \"Timestamp\". TransactionTable has the SessionID as my Partition Key, and the Timestamp as the Sort Key.\n\nIn my application I did not need to do any other queries so I did not need any GSIs.\n\nFor your application, if you are able to formulate a SQL-query-like-thing that would be able to delete the \\~1M items, then you can also put the variables of that query in a similar DeleteMarkers table, and use those fields in your query to your TransactionTable. It's a bit more complex than the Timestamps I used, but not impossible.",

I've tried to use the AWS pricing calculator to estimate the cost of the new DB, but i think i don't have thescsc right understanding of calculating the storage price for Aurora, and the estimations look way overpriced than expected.\n\n  \nI am replicating our current RDS MySQL setup with 800GB. Pricing calculator asks for \"Baseline I/O rate\" and \"Peak I/O rate\" for estimating the price of Aurora storage, but i am not sure of how to calculate those rates.\n\nThis is an example Total IOPS for test DB, from the metrics, for the last 1 day and a span period of 1 minute:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e89erkt8rwjg1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a2ede87a7535376607b848267ee9cc1cd04c981\n\n  \nIf i put those values of about 3.7k in the \"Baseline I/O rate\", i end up having a storage cost of about $2k which is a lot. \n\nOur current RDS MySQL database costs about $180 including storage (general purpose gp3). So i know that my input in those I/O fields in the AWS calculator might be wrong, but i don't know how then should i be calculating those values.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mn0dz2yarwjg1.png?width=1700&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cd2675100aec5652be16f22bee1b99ce76b0c5e\n\n  \nHELP!",
