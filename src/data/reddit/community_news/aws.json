      "text": "Hey ,\n\nA month ago, I posted **CloudSlash**, a tool to identify \"zombie\" infrastructure (unused NAT Gateways, detached EBS, Ghost EKS clusters) and i have been updating here on r/aws ever since. This time the entire core engine was rewritten to prioritize Safety. Here is what is new in V2\n\n**1. The Lazarus Protocol (Undo Button)**\n\nIf you choose to delete a resource (like a Security Group), CloudSlash now snapshots the configuration *\\_before\\_* generating the delete command.\n\nIt creates a \"restore.tf\" file containing the exact **Terraform Import blocks** needed to resurrect that resource in its original state. This removes the \"what if I break prod\" anxiety.\n\n**2. Mock Mode**\n\nA lot of you didn't want to give a random GitHub tool read access to your account just to test it. Fair point.\n\nYou can now run \"cloudslash scan --mock\".\n\nIt simulates a messy AWS environment locally so you can see exactly how the detection logic works and what the TUI looks like without touching your real keys or credentials.\n\n**3. Complete TUI Overhaul**\n\n\\- **Topology View:** Visualize dependencies (e.g., Load Balancer -> Listener -> Target Group).\n\n\\- **Interactive Region Picker:** No more hardcoded regions. It fetches enabled regions dynamically.\n\n\\- **Deep Inspection:** Press \"Enter\" on any resource to see the exact cost velocity and provenance (who created it).\n\n**4. Open Sourced Heuristics**\n\nI removed the \"black box\" nature of the detection. The README now contains a full **Heuristics Catalog** detailing the exact math used to flag a resource (e.g., \"RDS is Idle if CPU < 5% for 7 days AND ConnectionCount == 0\"). You can audit the logic before running it.\n\n**5. Graph Engine**\n\n3x faster graph traversal for large accounts ( > 500 resources ) . I refactored the engine to use flat slices instead of maps and implemented string interning for resource types, reducing RAM usage by \\~40% on large graphs.\n\n**Other Improvements since v1.3:**\n\n\\- **Headless Mode:** \"cloudslash scan --headless\" is now fully stable for CI/CD usage.\n\n\\- **Graph Engine:** 3x faster graph traversal for large accounts (>500 resources).\n\n\\- **Completion Scripts:** Native bash/zsh/fish auto-completion.\n\n\\- Validation: Strict tag-based overrides (\"cloudslash:ignore\") are now respected deeper in the graph.\n\n**andd manyyy moreee**\n\n**License:** Still AGPLv3 (Open Source). No paywalls.\n\n\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash](https://github.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash)\n\nbtw parsing AWS graphs is complex, so if you hit any weird edge cases or bugs , please let me know , i plan to fix them immediately\n\nStars are always appreciated :)\n\n:)  DrSkyle",

CloudFormation StackSets for example, at least service managed ones, don't have a native parallel in Terraform so if you're doing a lot of Organization wide work you're almost certainly going to deal with the horrors of CloudFormation to some degree.

You'd still also use Wrangler (CF) and code (i.e in a Lambda), Git (because you are't going to make commits using IaC) and something like Argo and Helm (because besides initialisation and data sharing, terraform really has no business in Kubernetes).",

I do appreciate however, since I don't use AWS much anymore, understanding the complexities of what resources I need vs what I'd need in Azure is the real gap. \n\nMy own recommendation is basically just that, have good enough portable knowledge between the 2 clouds.

By wrapping things in properly built modules you can focus on what the configuration should do, not how or where it is built. For example you create code not to deploy EC2 instances but simply ask for a deployment point, and that deployment point could be an auto-scaling group, K8s, containers, elastic beanstalk. It could be hosted on AWS, on GCP, on Azure. You don't care, you ask for something and you get something that fills that role with a consistent interface. \n\nYou ask for something to be running code and got something that is running code. The team could redeploy tomorrow on a different platform, or add a dozen new security features and you are none the wiser because you still have the exact same interface. \n\nIs most IaC written this way? No, but being able to abstract away those implementation details is one of the benefits that can enable more portable code. Even if your module ONLY supports a single style of deployment in a single provider, the fact that you have a module can enable you to more easily shift to somewhere else.",

              "text": "CDK is problematic and limited in use case.  There's a number of unfixable issues with it, some of which you won't \"see\" in particular situations (if you're purely a dev, for example), some of which you can't avoid forever.\n\nCDK as it's currently implemented is sugar over CloudFormation.  As a result it brings forward the large set of intractable baggage that CloudFormation has.\n\nAs a syntactic sugar layer over CF it *does* address some of CF's larger warts such as requiring the complexities of Lambda backed custom resources for things so mundane as a random name generator for resource IDs or a lookup of an existing subnet to deploy to by tag filter.  Arguably the #1 killer feature of CDK is that it effectively wraps that whole insanity away in a construct.  But...it's still ultimately a custom lambda and everything that comes with it that must live for the life of your stack despite doing nothing after deployment.  And the real kicker is this model that CF uses is incredibly fragile.  CDK goes to great pains to try and bullet proof the code here, but it can only do so much as the architecture of CloudFormation is intrinsically fragile and when (not if) it fails it can often result in extremely difficult if not completely impossible to fix problems.  Problems that can require tearing the entire stack down, manually finding what it couldn't destroy and cleaning that out, and only after hours of waiting for CF to timeout its failures all while your prod sits dead in the water while you scream at AWS support to kick it over on the back end.\n\nTerraform's data resources make most of CDK/CF web of custom lambda hack resources a non-event.  What can't be handled by data resources is handled by utility providers like \"random\".  But the biggest win here is that you can *always* fix a broken terraform stack / state / etc and you never have to fight with the trainwreck of a service that CloudFormation is to do so.  TF stacks have far less issues in general because the model is far cleaner, but when they do have issues they're far easier and faster to identify and fix because you aren't dealing with the blackbox of CloudFormation that stuck in some operation you can't force quit or force fail.\n\nAnd then there's inter-department needs.  CDK is ok for developers that are deeply familiar with the advanced features of their target programming language, but try collaborating with the Networking, Security, Auditing, Admin teams in larger orgs about resource configurations and you'll quickly find that almost no one else can read your skibidi toilet code much less grok how the resources are actually being configured.  The cop out from developers is always, \"Oh just synthesize to CF\" as if autogenerated CF is much better; it might as well be minified javascript.  TF's plan output is both incredibly clean, it's also very complete, and doesn't require any assumptions or masters in software engineering to grok.\n\nCDK being glorified CloudFormation also means you're stuck with CF's pathetic duct tape solution for dealing with drift.  I know, you'll say drift can't happen if you're \"doing things the right way\", but some of us actually work in reality.\n\nCF is slow.  It's slow when things work correctly, but it's horrifically slow when things to bad.  If you're keeping the default of trying to rollback the entire stack on any failure, you get to not only wait for that entire failure to finish rolling back before you can try to apply the syntax error fix you quickly made, but if you don't really know what went wrong so sorry CF has already started nuking the evidence you need to actually diagnose WTF happened.  Or you can chose to not roll back so you can investigate the failed resources for clues, but it's not like you can sanely fix the code and just roll forward.  Maybe to fix the issue you need to force resources X and Y to be destroyed and rebuilt, but you'd prefer not to rollback the 300 other resources that are fine.  TF that's trivial (just taint the two resources and apply), but in CF you're basically forced to roll the entire thing back and then try again from whole cloth.  What PITA.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that increasingly applications are deploying with a variety of integrations.  Hooking into SaaS observability, hooking into ticketing alert systems, hooking in to 3rd party IdPs like Okta, hooking into CICD to auto-configure GitHub actions, etc.  With CDK you're basically at a dead end: The only option you have is to write your own incredibly hacky, incredibly fragile lambda backed custom resources...including all the insanity of trying to auth all them securely.  \n  \nI've already written a novel and I've only scratched the surface.  There's a reason that you almost never see CDK used for anything more than the most trivial of stack architectures.  Even with a simple \"hey, I'm an api service!\" application stacks it's easy to blow through CF resource count limits on things like API Gateway configurations and force yourself into a bunch of nested CF stacks, massively complicating an already messy system and easily locking yourself into dependency hell between the nested stacks because again, CF has no data resources and imports/exports are a sick joke in practice.\n\nTerraform for infra.  Helm for k8s.  Ansible for OS.  Don't cross the beams.",

It works across multiple cloud providers and partner services. I find it is the easiest to use for cross-region or cross-account deployment since you can use multiple providers. It has data objects that you can use to look up existing resources within your account too. I find its conditional logic and validation/formatting capabilities a bit lacking, and you have to drop down to writing custom resources though Go or CLI which is not as clean as how CDK/CloudFormation do it with lambdas. Terraform state is also a little bit less consistent than CDK/CloudFormation which seem to roll back cleaner.",

They make the same API calls using AWS SDK to create resources, terraform state management is different compared to CloudFormation (where you don't need to manage state). \n\nBut if you are new to the cloud, start with console. Create, update and delete things directly see what API calls are made in CloudTrail, try doing this with CLI (which makes the same API calls using boto3) then take a dip into CloudFormation (maybe CDK too), then terraform. So you'll get an idea of how things work in AWS. And you'll also feel terraform is faster. \n\nGood luck navigating the docs and breaking things!",

And here comes the praise for Cloudformation - it always brings back the latest version if an error occurs during script application.\n\nApart from that, I have absolutely no other complaint from Terraform, it’s a great tool. And please don’t put too much weight on that in your final decision, as this happens extremely rarely and as I said it’s more of a personal rant than anything else.",

I started with an existing stack that had a handful of resources, and *one* I had purposely drifted and *another* one, \"PermissionsBoundary\", I made a change to in the template.\n\nWithout drift-awareness (i.e. the \"old\" way we're all used to), it wanted to modify the one PermissionsBoundary resource that I had modified in the template. *With* drift-awareness, it wanted to modify the changed resource in the template *and* the resource that I had drifted (yay!) but it *also* wanted to modify several other resources. What's even more strange is that drift-aware change sets show you which resources have drifted, and it indicated that these had *not* (see the images). When I examined the changes it was going to make, I saw a bunch of \"changeset:KNOWN\\_AFTER\\_APPLY\" values where the template was using !ImportValue.\n\nWhat baffles me is I thought that values exported from other stacks *cannot be changed* if they're being imported by other stacks. So, if this stack already is importing a value and the new template *continues* to import it, the value cannot change.\n\nI was really hoping that drift-awareness was going to give us something more like 'terraform plan', but, with it flagging anything using !importValue like this, it makes it almost not worth using.\n\nDoes anybody know of a way to disable that behavior? Or maybe shed some light on why they made it work like this?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4llmrwnno2dg1.png?width=1375&format=png&auto=webp&s=94c8f1e8dd7c71da5ec7f3b7b23c7ba3cc8c1a69\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1bsp28oo2dg1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3e0f3f47f0352f2f3db7de99325ed32e0619184\n\n",

From what I can tell, drift aware change sets treat !ImportValue as opaque at plan time, so they cannot prove the value is unchanged even if the export is effectively immutable while in use. That’s why you see KNOWN\\_AFTER\\_APPLY and a proposed update even though nothing will really change. It feels less like a real diff and more like CloudFormation being conservative because it cannot resolve the dependency graph across stacks. I do not think there is a way to disable that behavior today. The only workaround I have seen is minimizing ImportValue usage for things that should never trigger updates, or just mentally filtering those changes out and trusting no-op updates, which is not very satisfying.",

I was supposed to enroll an external production account into our prod OU through Control Tower,  which has compliance stacksets and some SCPs that get enforced. I thought I had done my homework - went through all the account resources to make sure nothing would get auto-remediated. But somehow I still managed to screw it up because of a silly reason, there were a few resources sitting in regions we don't govern, and they started throwing forbidden errors everywhere after the enrollment. I fixed it by reverting and unenrolling the account, but the whole thing made me disappointed that how I missed this.\n\nThe thing that really gets me is there's no safety net. When I was a software engineer, I always had QA testing my code before anything touched production. Now every infrastructure change feels like I'm walking a tightrope with no net underneath.\n\nI made the switch from software engineering to cloud operations about two years ago, and honestly, incidents like this make me question whether I made the right call.

Not yours.\n\n    Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS aims to abstract away most aspects of managing its underlying infrastructure as code (IaC) templates from the user. This is facilitated through the use of its configuration files to define your landing zone environment. However, it is important to keep some common IaC best practices in mind when modifying your configuration to avoid pipeline failure scenarios.\n\nFor those that spun this up, how customizable is this solution/ how easy is it to live with? I know Control Tower is generally a pain, but leadership is dead set on it, so trying to choose the lesser evil.\n\n  \nThe architecture diagram  \n[https://imgur.com/1PLQctv](https://imgur.com/1PLQctv)",

However all 3 options are dependent on CT and it all feels like you're trying to manage a block box via IaC where you only have the ability to change some configurations instead of architecting your multi-account setup the way you want it.   \n  \noutside of CT there are some other options, one of them is for example orgformation, however i'm more a cdk person myself so i build my own solution that's build on top of organizations and stacksets. Stackset are really underestimated, but are really powerfull and give you a lot of control and flexibility.

Customization support is poor (it can deploy CFN stacks and thats about it), Some Route53 features are lagging behind and some other things but overall the manpower/value ratio is great. Upgrades can sometimes be a bit finicky but the Issues tracker is active and I've only pinged AWS Support for it once in the early days.\n\nConfig can live in S3 or Github or anything CodeConnections supports. You basically never need to touch Control Tower. \n\nI'm surprised at the negative opinion here.

If you have a separate dev cluster, you can deploy your updated settings to dev first, verify the changes, and then deploy to prod.\n\nNow, it's probably unlikely that you'll need to change cluster settings very often, but it's a good standard practice to keep completely isolated resources for each environment as it avoids guesswork when making updates.\n\nAs a sorta of related anecdote, I was in an environment where we had separate dev and prod resources, but we ran our \"staging\" workloads in the dev environment for acceptance tests. Nonprod is nonprod, right? Turns out, no. A load test against staging knocked our networking offline because we overloaded a NAT server, which then halted all of our dev work because the dev resources were offline. After that, we made sure we had three entirely separate environments, but we would spin down staging when it wasn't in use.",

          "text": "Lets take step back and ask what a ECS cluster is actually abstracting ?\n\nThe cluster abstracts administrative scope. Specifically, it serves as a boundary for three things like :\n\n1. Security and Permissions (IAM)\n\nA cluster is the easiest place to draw a hard line. It is much simpler to say like junior devs can only see or edit things in cluster B than it is to write complex IAM policies that filter specific services or capacity providers inside a single cluster.\n\n2. Namespace and Service Discovery\n\nServices inside a cluster can easily find each other via Service Connect or Cloud Map. If you put your prod and stage environments in the same cluster, they share the same namespace and separating them into clusters prevents stage app from accidentally talking to a prod database due to a naming collision.\n\n3. Monitoring and Cost Allocation\n\nWhile you can tag individual services, it is much easier to look at a CloudWatch dashboard or a billing report broken down by cluster name. It gives you a clear view of a specific environment without the noise of 50 other unrelated services.\n\nNow lets see when should you actually split into different clusters?\n\nSince you mentioned a single cluster allows you the freedom to do what you want, you are technically correct. You don't have to split them. However, you should consider a split if you hit these scenarios:\n\n\\- If someone accidentally deletes the cluster or misconfigures a cluster-wide setting, does the entire company go dark, or just one department?\n\n\\- If most teams have at least two clusters like prod and non prod. This ensures that testing a new capacity provider setting in staging can't accidentally starve your Production services of resources.\n\n\\- If your healthcare related service needs to be GDPR or HIPPA compliant, it's much easier to put it in its own cluster with its own dedicated ASG and restricted access than to try to prove to an auditor that it’s virtually separated from your other services like data ingestion or some other operational in the same cluster.\n\nI have three cluster running for prod, qa and dev. currently only one API service is running once its scale or add more services then will think to categories them better as per compliance or security need etc.\n\nSimple terms like analogy then think of ECS cluster as shopping mall. ECS services are individual store like Apple store, Nike or Starbucks store. Cluster become mall management office. You could have one big mall that holds every store in the city, or you could have five smaller malls. Both setups get the job done, but the management experience changes, handle compliances and each area demand.",

Having an account for every dev will cost more — this is blatantly untrue. A lot of studies have shown that in general it costs the same or less.  This is because with shared dev accounts there always ends up with orphaned resources that no seems to be able to say who it belongs to. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen an RDS resource left on all the time because “someone might use it” or “the team can’t remember who provisioned it.”\n2. We don’t have enough people to safely vend these accounts — this is a skill problem. You can create AWS accounts via CloudFormation or Terraform today. There’s tons of AWS services and 3P products that provide automated governance at scale AND meet whatever compliance requirements you need. Any lag in the vending process means you have a manual driven culture somewhere that you need to fix.  There’s a lot of studies I’ve seen over the years that shows a correlation between the time it takes to vend and the success someone has in the clouds. If it takes you two weeks to vend an account, you are probably overpaying for the cloud and not taking full advantage of it.\n3. Our developers will be able to spin up whatever they like — this indicate either you don’t have proper governance in place of your cloud environment or you don’t have the proper tools for safe development. Again this is a solved problem by AWS, the OSS community and 3P. You just need to use the tools available.",

When it worked, it was because Marketplace reduced friction, not because someone randomly found the listing and bought.\n\nIf traction is low, I would treat it as a support channel rather than a growth engine.

They optimize for predictable performance, network bandwidth, and failure domains rather than Lego-style flexibility. The CPU to GPU ratio is intentional because a lot of their customers push data hard through the GPUs, not just VRAM-bound inference. It feels wasteful if your workload is light on CPU, but it simplifies capacity planning and isolation on their side.\n\nYour realistic options are limited. You can look at g5 instances for smaller GPU counts, or split workloads across multiple smaller instances instead of one big box. For training, people sometimes decouple preprocessing onto separate CPU instances and keep GPU nodes as dumb as possible. If you truly want runpod-style flexibility, AWS is the wrong mental model. They sell reliability and integration first, efficiency second.",

      "text": "I’m looking for advice on the best way to install awscli, boto3, and botocore on Debian 13 EC2 instances.\n\nPreviously, awscli was installed via an EC2 launch template using:\n\n/usr/bin/apt-get install awscli --assume-yes\n\nboto3 and botocore were installed via an Ansible playbook using pip. (versions were not pinned)\n\nA breaking change in the pip versions of boto3 and botocore caused compatibility issues with the awscli version from Debian 11’s apt. To resolve this, I updated the launch template to install awscli from the official zip:\n\n[https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86\\_64.zip](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip)\n\nNow, testing upgrading to Debian 13, global pip installs are blocked (error: externally-managed-environment), and venv is recommended.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWould it be best to move boto3 and botocore installation to the EC2 launch template, using apt:\n\n/usr/bin/apt-get install awscli python3-boto3 python3-botocore --assume-yes\n\nThis should ensure compatibility between all three packages. Any downsides or better approaches?",

      "text": "Looking for guidance from others who have dealt with AWS account suspensions during active billing or security reviews.\n\nOur production workload was hit by a large DDoS attack, which caused a sudden spike in AWS WAF, CloudFront, and CloudWatch usage and a very large, unexpected bill. We opened support cases immediately, shared ARNs, detailed timelines, WAF analytics, request counts in the millions per day, and attacker IP samples. AWS acknowledged the issue and escalated it for service-team review and possible billing adjustment.\n\nWhile this review was still ongoing, and despite requesting temporary billing hold during the investigation, the account was suspended for non-payment. We’re now unable to log in to the console, which has taken production applications offline and blocked access to CloudWatch and infrastructure management.\n\nAt this point, we’re trying to understand the correct escalation path. For those who’ve experienced something similar:  \nIs there a recommended way to get an account reinstated while a billing dispute is under review?  \nAre there escalation channels beyond the standard account support form once console access is blocked?\n\nAppreciate any guidance or experiences from the community.",
