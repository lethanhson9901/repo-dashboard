The cloud formation is treated as a transaction and has stronger roll back guarentees. Terraform is far more flexible with what you can express, it is incremental deployment which is why it is often noticeably quicker",

If you’re doing Ops, you gotta think like a you’re ops. If you’re doing frontend, think frontend. If you’re doing backend, think backend. Don’t do OPs like a frontend person.

Not everyone will agree with my take, I just sharing my opinion having worked on both ends, in teams that have worked both ends. It’s pretty much why I’m on SST with Pulumi now, because it’s a great middle ground. Needs more time to get the other providers working perfectly but at least my AWS workloads are singing and I find them more readable.",

Within a single CloudFormation template, CloudFormation will try to do as much work in parallel as possible. But if your CDK produces multiple CFN templates, then these CFN templates will be executed in series. There is a --concurrency option but that will still only work if complete templates are not dependent on each other.\n\nFor fastest CDK deployments, it's therefore best to let CDK synthesise everything into one monster CFN template and deploy that. But for readability and maintainability, you may still want to split things up a bit and accept that the deployment (in particular the initial deployment, or changes that touch all your synthesised templates) are slower.",

CDK shines when you need more abstraction or logic, but you pay a bit for that flexibility. If pipeline speed is the concern, I’d first look at asset builds, context lookups, and how often stacks are being redeployed rather than switching tools outright.",

CloudFormation is an API. it's not a client. there are a lot of client applications to interact with the CloudFormation API, including Terraform. Terraform is solely a client.\n\nthere seems to be a theme of \"managing cloud as a developer is bad\" here. I've never experienced that before. it comes off as cope. any sufficiently advanced operation will be managing their entire infrastructure operation programmatically - either with a framework like Pulumi or CDK or by writing your own application in-house. I've written many apps in-house that interact with AWS APIs to manage infrastructure programmatically via code (Python or Go).\n\nTerraform doesn't have its own client libraries. it uses the official Go SDKs any other project could would use. it's extremely simple. even despite that, it's certainly not \"fast\" because it has to reconcile state with every operation. if you want the fastest possible operation, just run something against the AWS API directly and don't track state at all. you'd simply have to tag the resources properly for service discovery. I've done it at massive scale.\n\nthat might be too complicated to get started with. usually environments I manage \"evolve\" to more complex/sophisticated orchestration. but one thing I can promise you: you'll sound like a damned fool if you go around in this industry acting like Terraform is the end-all, be-all of IaC. it's better than no IaC and great for \"hello world\" and \"getting started\" scale. but it's a mess even once you're dealing with a couple dozen AWS accounts, it's untenable once you're working with 100-200 AWS accounts where thousands of deployments need to \"just work\" for a team of ~5 people managing it all.",

Free tier is very confusing for a lot of people and my issue was always its interaction with other accounts in the organization.\n\nIt used to be that only one account can benefit from it, but there are different types of free tier. GuardDuty is a good example where you will have 30 days free on every account/region. I personally would find it very helpful if you could provide that separation.\n\nAlso, it's missig the new CloudFront free plan - not sure if you would like to include it.",

Mixing time critical jobs and long running memory heavy tasks in the same worker almost guarantees spikes and restarts. I would split workers by job class first, even if they still share infra, so the heavy batch stuff cannot starve or crash onboarding jobs.\n\nSQS plus autoscaled workers is usually a good baseline because it forces you to think in smaller, bounded jobs and gives you backpressure for free. Redis can work, but it is easier to accidentally turn it into a memory footgun. Also worth looking at streaming large payloads instead of loading everything into memory at once. Most Node memory issues I see come from buffering way more than expected.",

If have the API auto scale based on CPU/memory to make sure it stays responsive.  I would go with the SQS option for queueing jobs, because you can auto scale your workers based on queue length, and that way you keep background job processing responsive.\n\nIt's not clear exactly how the background jobs work, i.e. is it always one type of job, or are there multiple different jobs?  Basically I would go with one queue per job type, and have dedicated workers assigned to their own queue, but if that creates extra work, a single queue/worker combo will do fine\n\nLonger term, depending on how the whole system works I might be tempted to convert the API to API gateway.  You can use it to validate requests without code and place items direct into SQS.  Other endpoints can use lambda functions.  For the reports, save them S3 and then in the API return a redirect to a pre-signed S3 url so user can download easily without exposing the bucket itself.  These are future suggestions though, for now just moving away from EC2 and into Fargate with SQS buffering should take you an awfully long way",

That way, there's always a worker container available to process short tasks in case there's a spike in user activity (or migrate short tasks to a lambda function).  You can also set up predictive scaling policies so that your cluster scales automatically ahead of predicted demand patterns. \n\nEither use redis + a lambda function + the EventBridge scheduler, AWS SQS, or a managed solution like Temporal to handle delegation of queued tasks to your worker containers.\n\nFigure out the memory problem first. Your program shouldn't be crashing regardless of spike in user activity. It should be queuing any jobs your container can't handle. I recommend SQS for that.

Everything in one view.\n\nOther than that - you forgot three essential services in your list. Make sure you throw in a WAF at your public endpoint (CloudFront, API GW or ALB) for DDoS/XSS and other protections. And you'll want to use ACM and Route53 to get a proper X.509 cert so you can do https:// instead of http://.\n\nAWS is all about building blocks, that each do one thing and do one thing well, and can be combined in a lot of different ways. And that's a good thing, IMHO. Consider the opposite. Suppose that AWS would have a ready-to-go solution that would allow you to make an https:// API call (using a custom domain name), that would invoke code. Now you're managing code in that solution. Then there would be another complete solution that would accept events from some sort of queue and run code in response, with retries upon failure. Now you need to manage code in that solution as well, with slightly different configuration parameters and capabilities. Before you know it, AWS would have to manage 100s of environments where users can run code. Better to have one all-singing-all-dancing solution for running code that can be integrated everywhere: Lambda.\n\n(In reality, AWS already has half a dozen solutions to run code in a serverless fashion. It's not just Lambda, but also Lambda@Edge, CloudFront Functions, SSM Documents and a few others. When for instance a new Python runtime is launched, we always find that support for that runtime in these solutions is added on a different schedule. So we could go to Python 3.13 in Lambda, but not yet in our SSM documents. Grrr.)",

It can even be 50 different things depending on how granular you want to get.\n\nYou can pay someone to make the 5 different things seem like 1 thing, or you could us a service that doesn't have 5 things but only has 1 thing that just happens to be the thing you need.\n\nDoing this yourself on EC2 is also 5 things (if you just pick 5 random things). But EC2 itself is also more than 5 things (Instance, ENI, IP, AMI, EBS, Subnet, VPC, SG, AWS Account) so it's never really 'just the few things you wanted' if you don't specify your scope.\n\nIt can be 'one thing' if you scope it to a single Git repo, but that repo would need all the config to make that 1 thing happen (by doing 5 things in its configuration).\n\nPerhaps the issue here is how you perceive 'things' or 'complexity'; depending on your perspective merely including a standard library for a function that needs a runtime to open a socket and read and write on it is already too complex, but there isn't going to be a solution that doesn't do those things. But is that a problem? Not really, you're probably not even taking those into account because they are just there.\n\nThe same goes for the services and granularity of the components you consume. The complexity doesn't go away, it's just packaged and abstracted differently. Keep in mind that complex ≠ hard (or difficult), it merely means that a thing is composed out of multiple other things.",

With a little tuning you probably can get it down fairly small reducing your EBS cost (that shit is expensive). \n\nIndividual file restores are trivial, but require access to S3. Bulk file restores (like after a crypto attack) are a bit harder as you need to touch every file so a script to find and restore versions based on timestamp is probably necessary. \n\nYou also need to manage S3 lifecycle policies, which are a different than normal backup retention settings that we are used to. \n\nOn the plus side, if the virtual appliance ever gets corrupted, you just replace it. No need to try and fix it or restore it from a backup. \n\nIf you are paranoid you can copy the entire S3 bucket to another region, sync it to another cloud provider or both.",

It is certainly possible to restore such a snapshot to a new volume, mount the volume and restore individual files from those, but that's probably just as awkward as your Druva solution.\n\nFor an AWS native file-level solution, you can use \"aws s3 sync\" from a cron/Task Scheduler job to sync the content of your user directories to an S3 bucket. If the S3 bucket is then versioned and has a lifecycle policy to delete old versions after seven years, you've achieved your goals. You might also want to enable Intelligent Tiering to save on storage costs. And add an S3 Gateway Endpoint to your VPC to save NAT/Egress costs to the public S3 Endpoints.\n\nIf you want an enterprise-grade solution, look at products like Tivoli Storage Manager or any of the other backup tools you can find in any corporate data center. If your EC2 is Linux, you could even use the old UNIX backup tool to make incremental backups.\n\nHaving said this, why do you run a file server in an EC2 in the first place? If you're serving files to other EC2s in AWS, then wouldn't EFS/FSx be a much better solution (and one that is integrated with AWS Backup)? And if you're serving files to systems outside of AWS, why a fileserver in AWS and not something like AWS Storage Gateway with an S3 backend?",

I'm also in the middle of creating an Arazzo plugin for Serverless Framework.

Creating additional layers of abstraction around CDK is understandable, that's how we developers think after all. It's one of the most common mistakes you can make with CDK though.\n\nCDK is already clean and clear as it is. Adding these layers will make you feel very clever and save you some LoC but add so much mental overload that it is never worth it. Onboarding new colleagues (especially the ones that already know CDK) will become a lot harder. The consulting firms you have to involve because you fucked up big time will love it that they can charge so many extra hours.\n\nCDK is the best when it comes to IaC because code is always superior to declarative forms when it comes to describing infrastructure. You need things like \"this ID has to be some combination of other IDs\" all the time. Code beats anything else here. The heavy downside is: it's code. Ask ten developers and you'll get twelve solutions.\n\ntl;dr: Don't create additional abstractions around CDK. You're digging your own grave. Write business constructs, not functional ones. Do not fear some extra LoCs, CDK is very readable on it's own.",

I complied with all the remediation needed, even had to explain that CI/CD activity from GitHub Actions IP != human sign-in location.\n\nNow support is repeatedly insisting I delete EKS node group IAM roles that are actively in use, required for node groups to operate, and properly scoped standard EKS worker/ECR/CNI policies.\n\nThey haven’t provided any concrete justification beyond generic shared responsibility text and a link to how to delete a role. \n\nAnyone been through this?

      "text": "I posted my \"Forensic Cloud Accountant\" for AWS here last week and the feedback was honestly super helpful.  I  did some updates on the detection engine to be less aggressive and smarter about false positives.\n\nThe big changes in v1.2.5:\n\n**first , EKS Ghost Detection** Standard autoscalers often keep Node Groups active solely to run daemonsets (like `kube-proxy` or `aws-node`), even when no user applications are running. The tool now filters out this system noise. If a Node Group is burning cash but only serving system pods, it gets flagged as a \"Ghost.\" This also includes a check for \"Zombie Control Planes\" (clusters idling with 0 nodes for >7 days).\n\n**second , trap door analysis** This feature targets configuration drift. Specifically, it detects Fargate profiles that are targeting namespaces that have been deleted. The tool validates profiles against the current cluster state to flag these broken links/config debt.\n\nand also Safety Tags (Thanks u/pint) for pointing out \"Idle\" doesn't always mean \"Abandoned.\" I didn't want people accidentally nuking a dev spike, so I added a simple tag override. You can now tag any AWS resource with cloudslash:ignore to whitelist it. You can even set it to expire (e.g., 2026-01-01) or base it on cost (cost<15).\n\n\n\nPricing/Repo A few people asked about the business model. I’m keeping the Pro remediation as a one-time $49 license (lifetime). I really dislike subscriptions for local CLI tools, so I'm not doing that. The core scanner is still AGPL and free to use.\n\nRepo:[https://github.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash](https://github.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash)\n\n(P.S. To u/bqw74 \\- I finally fixed that annoying [install.sh](http://install.sh) bug, sorry about the mess).\n\nLet me know if this version feels a bit smarter on your clusters and what else i should add to  make cloudslash more helpful for your specific workflow.",

From the metrics we know that this database is overprovisioned, and we are looking at smaller (cheaper) instances, possibly a db.r7i.xlarge.\n\n(Note that there is a discrepancy in the documentation: [This page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.Concepts.General.InstanceClasses.html) claims that MSSQL SE supports a db.r7i.xlarge, while [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.Support.html) claims it doesn't.)\n\nBased on the CW Metrics and DB Insights I can pretty much predict how the DB will behave regarding CPU, memory, network and EBS I/O when switching instance types. However, the z1d.2xlarge also has 300 GB of NVMe SSD instance store, and I have no clue whether this is used, what for, and whether this will impact performance if I switch to an instance type without instance store. It doesn't seem like there are CW Metrics available for starters, and I also can't find any documentation on it. Does anybody know of a way to understand what's going on with this storage?\n\nThe problem is also that this is a production database that runs 24/7. Due to it being Multi-AZ, switching instance types requires quite a bit of downtime that we have to schedule in advance. This severely limits the ability to experiment. I do have a test environment but I don't have a mock load generator that is representative of the workload.",

      "text": "Hi there, total noob here trying to host my first hobby project on AWS.   \nIt's a web app game with a NextJS frontend and NestJS backend and I'm looking for information on how best to host it on AWS. \n\n**Short Description**:   \n\\- It's a text based simulation game in which millions of entities enter a dungeon and events happen. Players can then influence these entities by gearing them, helping them and guiding them inside the dungeon without actually deciding or influencing events directly. E.g. an entity can be influenced to take the 'Grind' or 'Scout' action, but the outcome of that action is simulated based on factors about the environment, skills, time inside the dungeon, etc... The player has no direct influence over that result.   \n\\- Players can follow up on their favorite entities like a sort of Tamagochi.   \n\\- For some 'Legendary' events, an LLM integration (direct from the backend to Claude API's) writes a bigger story for added flavor.   \n\n\n**Technically**: There's a NextJS frontend web application in which the player can do some actions. This is connected to the NestJs Backend API that is linked to a PostgreSQL db.   \nThere's also a concurrent NestJS worker cron job that acts as the simulation. It loops over all alive entities and simulates actions on it. Every entity generates an Action Log with possible Combat Log records for every action, so there's hundreds of millions if not billions of expected records generated. \n\n**Current State:**  \nSo after struggling with Vercel and Railway (both cost and couldn't manage the worker properly) I tried hosting it on AWS directly. After reading some docs and googling a bit I started experimenting with the different tools. Currently I'm using **Amplify for the frontend** and **Elastic Beanstalk** for the backend API. The database is running on RDS and I'm using CloudFront too. The worker cron job however, is **not running on AWS yet**. \n\n**Some questions**:   \n\\- What would be the preferred tool to use for the worker? Should I host that on Elastic Beanstalk too? It does work with the same backend code as the API so that should be easy enough...  \n\\- Is my current setup correct for the type of game / web app? If not, what other tools could be recommended?   \n\\- What would be some pitfalls or common mistakes I should learn about knowing that this is my first app on AWS and I don't have a lot of experience with stuff like this?   \n\\- How could I estimate my total costs for running this app? I'm on the Free plan right now and it's estimating around 40$ monthly. This is with it running for about a month, but without other players. Just me and an additional tester. (See screenshot)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ea11eepbjd9g1.png?width=376&format=png&auto=webp&s=8db1be3ff3db433c1fa746a45e328533df45d648\n\nAny other help or guidance or references to great docs or tutorials is greatly appreciated. \n\nRegards",

I would at least containerize your application and run it in ECS Fargate so it is easy to scale. I would front the ECS containers with a load balancer and remove the cloud front for now until you really need a global distribution. For the database make sure you r using Aurora vs standard.\n- The Cron Job can be replaced by using an Eventbridge Schedule Rule which triggers the action. The target of the Eventbridge Rule can be a Lambda Function or it can send a message to a queue, or API endpoint.\n- Amplify is fine, but I have heard it has some issue for larger applications specifically if you are using Cognito for authentication.\n- For the Database make sure you optimize your code to write to the DB write instances and read from the read instances, or better yet use the RDS Proxy. I think it takes care of a lot DB issues.\n\n- Cost: your biggest constant cost will be your database because it will be constantly up and running no matter the number of users. ECS should scale up and down as needed, but the DB will be constant.\n\nEdit: I would also spend a little time and learn CDK for Infrastructure as Code.

Run it as an ECS Fargate scheduled task triggered by EventBridge Scheduler. Same NestJS code, no servers to manage, and much easier to scale later.\n\n\\- Architecture: Amplify for Next.js + RDS for Postgres is fine. If you're adding workers, consider moving the API to ECS Fargate too, so API + worker share the same deployment model.\n\n\\- Big pitfall: Billions of action/combat logs will hurt Postgres fast. Keep game state in RDS, but stream append-only logs to S3 (Firehose works well). This alone can save you a lot.\n\n\\- Highly recommended action\\*\\* Costs: Set up AWS Budgets + Cost Anomaly Detection now (email alerts). Also watch CloudWatch Logs and NAT Gateway traffic and those surprise people the most.\n\n\\- Rule of thumb: Start simple, but design workers to scale horizontally (queue + multiple workers) so you don't have to rewrite everything later.\n\nYou're doing the right thing by thinking about this early and asking questions. Starting thinking now what worse can happen and design such way.",

So a container can be put on a cron schedule and then shut down when done, and they’ll just charge you for the time it runs. No limit on time. Then you’d have a DB container, front and back end container. Again, you’ll pay based on the CPU and memory they actually use. eg. If you’re efficient; it’ll cost less.  \n\nWith Fargate you’ll be paying for a set size of container all the time for the back and front end ones. So if you occasionally spike to 4GB RAM, you’ll need to pay for that amount all the time. But on Railway you’d only pay for that much during your spike. \n\nOn AWS the question is about how resilience, versus ease of management, versus cost. The cheapest would be just an EC2 or Litesail that you install some docker orchestration onto and run everything on there. Including your DB. Install it all on a separately mounted EBS so the instance can go down and come back up, put the instance in an autoscaling group of 1. You have resilience because the storage and instance are separated, but not much in way of AZ resilience or scaling ability. And it’d likely be cheaper with Hetzner etc. \n\nIf you don’t want to manage a DB, use RDS. But that comes with cost. And if you don’t want to manage orchestration, use ECS on EC2. And if you don’t want to manage servers at all, use Fargate. Scheduled tasks are supported by ECS, so you can do the scheduled job on there, but you will pay for the max amount of RAM and CPU you need throughout the whole job (unlike Railway). \n\nCodebuild is an alternative way to run a container on a schedule which is often simpler than ECS. But if you have the rest of the setup on that anyway then not as much of an advantage. \n\nRun things in autoscaling groups on ECS, tied to your EC2 autoscaling if you don’t use Fargate, separate storage from compute, put it in two AZe with a load balancer and RDS and you can fully enjoy a resilient, secure, scalable, easy to manage deployment. And you can pay the bill every month to match. \n\nMy personal projects go on Railway now. AWS is becoming increasingly hard to justify for hobby projects or those who aren’t already fully aware of what they’re letting themselves into.",

But if you must know, there are many reasons and I have seen multiple customers frustrated with LZA, not just this one.\n\nFirst of all, our large customer runs in multi-cloud environment where standardization of cloud agnostic tools is very important. This lends itself to better overall long-term support and maintenance where cloud teams can work across these CSPs more seamlessly. Terraform is their enterprise tool of choice.\n\nProServe designed LZA to make their jobs easier when deploying common architectures across many client environments. They have a bunch of canned IaC scripts for this purpose. So, it does that initial work well. Maintaining it however, once they leave, is an entirely different matter. And this is even with prior AWS staff who have worked with LZA for years. It's known to be very quirky,  hard to troubleshoot, maintain and manage operationally after initial deploys.\n\nLZA is error prone and fragile with second and third order affects when it breaks that can be even more difficult to fix. If it breaks other critical services, backing those changes out are not always doable since it touches so many things automagically behind the scenes. We've had  folks pulling all nighters fixing it. And these are very experienced AWS cloud engineers. We've even brought in AWS Enterprise Support LZA SMEs and they couldn't figure out how it broke at times.\n\nLZA is extremely slow when running and iterating changes through it. The logging of errors are not always helpful when looking for root cause. Documentation is lacking. The dependency on Node is a pain and sometimes not backward compatible. For all the things it automates, it causes headaches that in the end don't make it worth using from an operational perspective. The list goes on and on. In the end life was better without it.\n\nWe're already using Terraform more for IaC deployments of tenant account cloud services once stood up via LZA. Most dev teams come in with pre-existing Terraform scripts. So, that's already a step in the right direction away from LZA/CF.",

If you don't have that picture 100% complete then a complete surgical removal won't be possible, and you'll still be mopping up the pieces years from now.\n\nStarting from new, with a new root account, is unfortunately not always an alternative. I did that a while ago to my five-account personal test-environment and found that it takes about 30 minutes per account to move it over. Just because there are so many steps involved:\n\n1.

The dependency on GitHub issues for bug fixes and limited customization options made it frustrating to work with.\n\nTo answer your question directly: **surgical removal is actually more straightforward than you might think.** Here's what I'd recommend:\n\n1. Follow the [official AWS uninstall instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/uninstall-the-solution.html) to delete the pipeline, buckets, and stacks from the management account\n2. Once removed, your org structure, SCPs, and configurations remain untouched as LZA is essentially just a wrapper around AWS Control Tower managing those resources.\n\nHowever if your customer wants to also ditch Control Tower entirely (which it sounds like they might, given the Terraform direction), then I'd lean toward the total rebuild approach. Start up a new management account, build out your Terraform-based account vending and guardrails, then migrate workload accounts by inviting them to the new org.\n\nFor what it's worth, I ended up developing [my own CDK-based solution](https://github.com/towardsthecloud/aws-cdk-landing-zone-roadmap) after dealing with LZA's limitations. Native CDK with StackSets integration gives you way more control for multi-account provisioning and is actually maintainable when you need to extend it. Might be worth considering if Terraform doesn't pan out.\n\nGood luck with the extraction!",

API errors were either retried or the message returned back to the queue and retried later, finally ending in the DLQ.\n\nRecently this party has introduced rate limiting and has has said we have to live with the number imposed on us - we are not big enough users of their API I suppose. When we run we burn that rate limit in 5 mins or less. So now we need to look into a way of handling the rate limit and waiting up to an hour before retrying the message as our current strategy isn't working for us. I've tinkered with concurrency numbers and visibility time-outs and had some mitigation success but frankly I don't like it and prefer something more controllable.\n\nWould step-functions be a solution to this, I've never used them before and feeling a little unsure if it is a path worth pursuing? I've tried searching but probably not using the right terms.\n\nAny guidance appreciated. Meanwhile I'll be back to monitoring the DLQ and redriving.",

          "text": "Your main problem is twofold here: The SQS/Lambda trigger tries to process messages as fast as possible, and Lambda has a 15-minute runtime limit. If you insist on a Lambda solution, you need to work around those two limitations.\n\nThere's a neat trick you can use to help you work around problem number one: There is a DelaySeconds attribute in the SQS SendMessage API call. This allows you to put messages in the queue, but they'll only become visible after that delay. Unfortunately the maximum delay you can introduce this way is 900 seconds.\n\nIf that 900 seconds is enough to prevent hitting the backend rate limit, then you only need to modify the logic that dumps the 10K messages in the queue, but no changes to your existing logic would be required elsewhere.\n\nIf you need to spread out the work even further, beyond 15 minutes, here's what I would do: Dump the 10K messages in queue #1 just like you do now. Have a scheduled Lambda run every 15 minutes, have it grab a number of messages (using explicit ReceiveMessage/DeleteMessage API calls) that you can process within 15 minutes and dump them in queue #2, with a DelaySeconds so that they are released evenly across a 15-minute period. Then have a regular SQS/Lambda trigger on the queue #2 which processes the messages like normal. This way, no changes to your existing code will be required, just add one queue and the intermediate logic.\n\nAnother approach may need a little bit of architectural change, but could, in the end, be easier overall. Have a CW Alarm that triggers if the #messages in your queue is >0. This fires up a one-time job in ECS/Fargate. The job pulls messages from the SQS queue one by one and processes these at a rate that doesn't trigger the backend rate limits. The job then shuts itself down once the queue is empty. Going the ECS/Fargate route means that you don't have to work around the two problems I mentioned earlier, which will eventually lead to a cleaner solution.\n\nLast thing: At Re:Invent this year AWS launched Lambda Durable Functions. Think of it as a sort of Step-Functions-lite, integrated in Lambda. I have not worked with this yet, but it could possibly be a solution for your problem as well.",

      "text": "I am looking for interview pointers as I test the job market. So passively searching I guess is what they call it. I applied for an AWS CSM ISV role. I was surprised I was asked to interview. The role fits nicely with what I do today, but slightly different tech stack (AI vs Regulated industry what I do today). For more context, I had a brief call with the recruiter, who basically coached me for the 60 min phone screen. \"Do that, cover this, Im going to put you through to the 60 min phonee screen\", that type of discussion.\n\nSo Im looking for any customer solutions manager specific or ISV insight. I am comfortable with my level  of understanding of the generic AWS interview process. Lots of information available about that.  I am structuring my prep around that. But I wanted to see if there is anyone with customer solutions manager specific context? The JD was fairly generic but closely aligns with what I do today. I am particularly concerned this might be more of a customer success role by a different name. Thats not really my cup of tea. But the job description makes it sound more like customer-facing TPM role, which is what I do today. Either way, Im treating this serioiusly and want to use the opportunity as interview practice. \n\nWould appreciate if anyone has insights or suggestions on this role or industry segment specifically (ISV). If it matters I am deeply experienced and currently employed in big tech and work for an ISV but on the cloud stack side as opposed to AI. But I guess you could make an argument it is AI adjacent.\n\n\nThanks in advance for any and all responses. If this question is better suited somewhere else, I would appreciate that feeback as well.",

The company uses cloud computing, in most teams, and one of the current software engineers that I spoke with told me that it would be good to come in to the company with some familiarity with AWS.\n\nI am a little overwhelmed by how many services there are, and by the sheer number of learning resources available. Where should I start to begin building familiarity with AWS?\n\nI plan to spend around 30 minutes per day studying AWS, along with my studies, to give myself a base understanding of the tools, which I can then build on in my internship. I am fine spending money on a good course (maybe less than $100 USD). One issue I have is that I don't currently have personal projects in mind.\n\n  \nThanks!

I haven't found any answers online to this issue, but how do you consolidate the terraform task definition with code deployments?\n\nMy code pipeline builds the docker images, tags it with the commit hash, and then pushes it to ECR, creates a new task definition from the latest version, and only updates the container\\_definitions image property in each updated container. But then in the terraform file the image tag is static, so if I want to go back and update some cpu allocation for example, in one of the containers, I have to apply the changes with the static image. Is there a more efficient way to hold the task definition somewhere like S3 as the source of truth, and have terraform apply from it as well as have the code pipeline update it? Or what is the best way to do this?\n\nRight now I have it setup where my ecs service in terraform ignores the task definition, so if I update my TD, it creates a new revision but doesn't deploy becuase the docker image specified is not usable, then my code pipeline finds the latest revision (the one terraform made), compares it with TD currently used by the service, and creates a new revision that combines the container images (for the containers that didn't update) from the currently active TD, then the config from the LATEST TD (the terraform one), and the container images from the current deployment.\n\nBut this seems inefficient and is causing confusion.

We are using heavily Lambda functions as mean to implement serverless features to avoid containers where possible.\n\nThis works so far but a pain point for me is the limit of custom lambda layers you can create. I know there is the possibility to dump additional 3rd party libraries to an EFS network drive and then let the lambda import its runtime libraries from there.\n\nWhile this seems to work technically, this looks extremely overcomplicated too me. Also hacking the system path of a lambda function to point/import libraries from an EFS looks more like a \"don't do that\" than a best practice.\n\nI am lacking quite some experience in this area. Are there really no other ways of installing 3rd party libraries. In particular in Python with the AI tooling which explodes at the moment you easily run into issues here. Needles to say that maintaining such a library list in an network drive is error prone and tedious.  \nI can avoid in many situations running containers but I would need a way to add a slowly increasing number of Python libraries to my AWS custom lambda layer stack....\n\nI would appreciate insights or some hints what else would work - the objective is to stay serverless.",

          "text": "Loads of people have recommended Lambda Containers and I agree. But to expand on that answer just a bit more:\n\nA Docker container is a Docker container as far as the packaging is concerned. It doesn't matter whether the container will eventually run in EKS, ECS, Fargate or Lambda. You create a Dockerfile that pulls a base image, adds your code and dependencies, and lists an entry point. After the docker build you push the container to a repository (like ECR).\n\nBut that's where the commonality stops. When you have a Docker container that's intended to run in an EKS/ECS/Fargate environment, the container is normally expected to run 24/7, and usually needs to listen to some sort of TCP port for incoming traffic. So on the last line of your Dockerfile you start a daemon/service that is long-running, and you may need to add some graceful container-stop handling code as well (trapping various signals and such.)\n\nIn contrast, a Lambda container still runs in an event-driven environment, with 15-minute runtime limits, cold/warm start issues and everything. So the last line of your Dockerfile should not refer to a 24/7 daemon, but to the event handler code, similar to a regular Lambda. And in order to make it work in a Lambda environment, the Docker container needs some extra bits - but these are all included if you use the base container images AWS makes available for this. Your Dockerfile can really be as simple as this:\n\n    FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.12\n    \n    # Copy requirements.txt\n    COPY requirements.txt ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}\n    \n    # Install the specified packages\n    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n    \n    # Copy function code\n    COPY lambda_function.py ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}\n    \n    # Set the CMD to your handler (could also be done as a parameter override outside of the Dockerfile)\n    CMD [ \"lambda_function.handler\" ]\n\nIn addition, you need to setup an ECR for your container. But if you've ever done Docker containers before, you can probably have your first Lambda container up and running inside of 15 minutes.\n\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html#runtimes-images-lp](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html#runtimes-images-lp)\n\nFor complicated projects with loads of dependencies, this makes things a lot easier because you're not working with a combination of zip files and layers anymore - everything you need is just packaged into that single container. I also found the docker build process to be more reliable, because it doesn't matter if I do the docker build on my Silicon Mac, in a Cloud9 environment or in a CodeBuild environment - it just works.\n\nAnd for you, another advantage could be this: The total size of your deployment package (zip + layers) using the zip+layers method is 250MB. But a Docker container image for Lambda can be up to 10 GB. Makes all the difference for complicated projects.\n\nAnd yes, the pricing model for Lambda containers is the same as for everything else in Lambda: You pay for the runtime, not for idle.",
