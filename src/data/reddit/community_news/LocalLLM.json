If you ran too many epochs this can happen as well…. Try reducing epochs and LR after making sure you have removed all duplicates. Try with an LR of 1.5e-5 and then walk it up. Rank 32, alpha 64. If it continues, you don’t  have enough sample diversity. Try these first then walk up your learning strength until you find the expression you are looking for.

Handles **text, 2D images, 3D CT/MRI volumes, and whole-slide pathology** straight out of the box. No more toy models; this eats real clinical data.\n\nKey upgrades from MedGemma-1 (27B was text-heavy; this is compact + vision-first):\n\n# Imaging Benchmarks \n\n* **CT disease findings**: 58% → 61% acc\n* **MRI disease findings**: 51% → 65% acc\n* **Histopathology (ROUGE-L on slides)**: 0.02 → 0.49 (matches PolyPath SOTA)\n* **Chest ImaGenome (X-ray localization)**: IoU 3% → 38%\n* **MS-CXR-T (longitudinal CXR)**: macro-acc 61% → 66%\n* Avg single-image (CXR/derm/path/ophtho): 59% → 62%\n\nNow supports **DICOM natively** on GCP – ditch custom preprocessors for hospital PACS integration. Processes 3D vols as slice sets w/ NL prompts, pathology via patches.\n\n# Text + Docs \n\n* **MedQA (MCQ)**: 64% → 69%\n* **EHRQA**: 68% → 90%\n* **Lab report extraction** (type/value/unit F1): 60% → 78%\n\nPerfect backbone for RAG over notes, chart summarization, or guideline QA. 4B keeps inference cheap.\n\nBonus: **MedASR** (Conformer ASR) drops WER on medical dictation:\n\n* Chest X-ray: 12.5% → 5.2% (vs Whisper-large-v3)\n* Broad medical: 28.2% → 5.2% (**82% error reduction**)\n\nGrab it on [HF](https://huggingface.co/google/medgemma-1.5-4b-it) or Vertex AI. Fine-tune for your workflow – not a diagnostic tool, but a solid base.\n\nWhat are you building with this? Local fine-tunes for derm/path? EHR agents? Drop your setups below.",

We have our proprietary inference acceleration technology, **PowerInfer**, where **hot-activation parameters are calculated on the NPU and cold-activation parameters are calculated on the SoC**. This allows for inference acceleration even with a heterogeneous computing hardware architecture. You can see an open-source example of **PowerInfer on GitHub (which has 8.6K stars)**.",

I have it at 32 for gpt-oss-120b and run about 120k context. Can't remember the exact number or layers for Qwen3, you basically juggle between the context you want to fit in vram and the amount of layers for performance\n\nJust the mxfp4 GGUF's for gpt-oss, and I think Unsloth Q6\\_K\\_XL for Qwen3. Qwen3 Next doesn't perform far off either (I think around 35 tok/s) and is way more efficient for context",

That seems to be the sweet spot right now for me, though the context is shorter than I'd like.\n\nWith 16GB of VRAM, my guess is that you could likely just barely run something like GPT-OSS-20B, with smaller models allowing for more context.

I haven't worked out all the kinks and performance elements yet, but you can take the neural memory module and use it on any other architecture as a replacement for quadratic attention. The kernels are there for forward and back passes. I'd prefer if you contributed to this project though =) you'd be working through issues either way if you took the neural memory just as a factor of writing your own architecture. \n\nThere is a potential issue with the sliding window required for the neural memory, you may have chunk boundary issues. From my testing I have this resolved, but I haven't gone past 50k steps on it yet to make sure it doesn't crop up again later.\n\nI also submitted this to the hackathon for this subreddit https://github.com/bigwolfeman/Retnet-Distillation \n\nI do not recommend using retnet for this. It is extremely unstable and slow. I had to patch torchscale just to make it work at all and kept finding issues in torchscale. But there is a nice reference implementation of keeping the teacher in vram beside the student, caching it's logits to disk, or inferencing from a vllm server and exposing top k logits.\n\nEven with how unstable retention is, it may be worth implementing to resolve chunk boundary problems. I am currently not maintaining retention in TitanMAC, but if further testing shows issues I'm planning to use it.\n\nAlso, my repo has the nested learning module based on SGD. It is a memory efficient optimizer. Allowing for more parameters with less vram. \n\nIf you're interested in using this repo, reach out to me. I have a branch I am doing a lot of development work on. I have found that feeding in hyper connections directly to the nested optimizer gives it richer signals for convergence and is basically free to do. It may be possible to average gradient heuristics to 16x16 tiles using my development branch, but I haven't had time to test this yet. It is the last step of the dynamic sparse implementation I'm working on in that branch. \n\n---\n\nOther great use for so much vram: distill a VLM to V-JEPA.\nDistill to HOPE https://github.com/Sk16er/hope_nano HOPE is a vram monster, I don't think this architecture is ready to scale yet, but it's research value is tremendous.\n\nEdit: the custom kernels are targeting blackwell, but they're written in Triton. Getting them ready for an h100 shouldn't be too bad.\n\nIf this deployment you want to do is far enough out in the future, I am planning on implementing the entire architecture in mojo for further performance gains. I'm still ablating several takes on the sparsity before I do this. The current code isn't designed to shard across gpus, though pytorch makes it fairly easy. Mojo is very good at sharing, though I haven't tested that myself.",

Nemo edges out Llama 3.1 8B on reasoning without being too wordy, and folks use it daily for email drafts and task categorization just like you want.​\n\nPaste project text, say \"summarize this for a team mtg, suggest 3 action items\" or \"rewrite this email to sound more collaborative\"—hits 20-40 t/s easy.

I recently tested it out and it has so many cool features. The one that stood out to me was how easy it was to choose diff types of graphic elements within the tool. For the slides, I gave my notes to Claude and asked it clean them up and structure them as slides. It did so and then I fed that into Gamma to build a presentation for me.\n\n  \n2. A productivity tip: I use voice dictation a lot. When I have lots of thoughts and context, I use dictation to feed AI. Be it drafting a long (and important) email, creating an SOP, or similar comms or documentation work, this saves me a lot of time. Also, I don't know the reason, but the results are so much better than when I type instructions. I am a decent writer so proofreading and editing doesn't take me long. Overall, this process works well for me so I definitely recommend testing it.",

They mean “run it on your own machine” (or your own server).\n\nPhi-4: Microsoft’s Phi family model; they’re saying it’s strong for structured/technical writing.\n\nGPT: OpenAI’s models (ChatGPT). They mean “best general-purpose chat without needing extra tool wiring.”\n\nClaude: Anthropic’s models.\n\nGrok: xAI’s model.\n\n\n3) What the jargon means\n\n“Local”: you run the model yourself (privacy, control, but you manage setup + performance).\n\n“Websearch”: hooking the model to a browsing/search tool so it can fetch current info instead of guessing.\n\n“Memory files”: usually means a RAG setup (retrieval-augmented generation): your notes/docs are indexed and the model can pull relevant chunks while answering.\n\n“Big leagues”: basically “best-of-the-best overall.”\n\n“Standalone”: not using tool integrations, agents, RAG, custom workflows—just the model as-is.\n\n“Claude MCP”: almost certainly referring to the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—a way to connect Claude to external tools/services (files, apps, search, automations) in a standardized way.\n\n“Cutthroat / win is a win”: the model will prioritize getting some answer that seems successful, even if it’s not cautious or perfectly aligned with your intent/rules.\n\n“Bend the rules / go around problems”: meaning it may produce confident outputs, shortcuts, or “creative” leaps that sound right but aren’t reliably grounded.\n\n“Wary of long memory and brainstorming without checks”: don’t let it build long chains of assumptions over time; verify with sources, logs, or constraints.\n\n\n4) Why it reads incoherent\n\nIt’s basically:\n\nmissing punctuation,\n\ntypos (“but u f you Claude mcp…” = “but if you use Claude MCP…”),\n\nand it jumps between local model advice and hosted model opinions without transitions.\n\n\nIf you tell me what you were trying to decide (local vs cloud, privacy, work tasks, hardware), I can translate their advice into a concrete recommendation that fits your situation.\"",

Typical tasks would include:\n- Code completion\n- Refactoring\n- Understanding and navigating large codebases\n- General coding Q&A / problem-solving\n\nSecondary (nice-to-have) use cases, mostly for learning and experimentation:\n- Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech\n- Image-to-Video / Text-to-Video\n- Other multimodal or generative AI experiments\n\nI understand these two machines are very different in philosophy:\n- DGX Spark: CUDA ecosystem, stronger raw GPU compute, more “proper” AI workstation–style setup\n- MacBook Pro (M4 Max): unified memory, portability, strong Metal performance, Apple ML stack (MLX / CoreML)\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand from people with hands-on experience:\n- For local LLM inference focused on coding, which one makes more sense day-to-day?\n- How much does VRAM vs unified memory matter in real-world local LLM usage?\n- Is the Apple Silicon ecosystem mature enough now to realistically replace something like Claude Code?\n- Any gotchas around model support, tooling, latency, or developer workflow?\n\nI’m not focused on training large models — this is mainly about fast, reliable local inference that can realistically support daily coding work.\n\nWould really appreciate insights from anyone who has used either (or both).",

If you want Claude level performance then you’re better off paying for Claude because you can easily spend upwards of $10k plus and still never hit what Claude or ChatGPT or Gemini deliver. \n\nBenchmarks for the M5 show a significant increase in performance for LLM’s over the base M4 and there are some rumors of new MacBook Pro’s being released at the end of the month so you might want to wait a few weeks and see if Apple introduces MacBooks with the M5 Pro and Max.",

              "text": "Agreed! As much as I love my local hosted models, the goal with local is privacy, wanting to learn from the ground up, and shielding against market uncertainty, not getting the best inference experience. I have a 256gb mac studio and I get very good local inference but I am spending a lot of time trying to configure local systems to manage context/ memory better. \n\nThe model outputs like glm 4.7 are great for me at q4 (I argue near if not at frontier level) but models at that level start around 20t/s for me and slow down as context increases. Plus I can only manage so much context to run locally on my mac studio so even if speed weren't an issue memory becomes an issue. So systems breaking things into smaller tasks help keep the models faster but introduce complexity too.\n\nI use claude in cursor for work and these aren't concerns. I just use the model and get top tier performance with no worries. I have a 128gb strix halo that gets similar speeds to the spark. I use that as a side gpt-oss120b for agentic tasks with moderate to low logic requirements for tasks other than coding. That's like gemini flash 2.5 doing agentic tasks for you not the model that we worry about replacing us lol",

Conclusion\n\nThe choice between MLX (Mac Studio) and DGX Spark for agentic coding is ultimately a choice between **Bandwidth** and **Intelligence**.\n\n**MLX** offers the raw horsepower to generate text rapidly, making it the superior \"Typewriter.\" However, its current software limitations regarding cache reuse in branching scenarios make it a forgetful writer—one that must constantly re-read the entire book to write an alternative ending.\n\n**DGX Spark** offers the architectural sophistication of a datacenter. It is a slower \"Typewriter\" due to memory bandwidth limits, but possessed of a photographic memory for context. In complex, non-linear agentic workflows where \"thinking\" (branching, backtracking, and planning) dominates \"typing\" (linear generation), the DGX Spark's ability to reuse the KV cache via TensorRT-LLM makes it the more performant and robust platform.\n\nFor the immediate future (2026), until MLX natively incorporates Radix Tree caching and PagedAttention primitives, the NVIDIA ecosystem remains the pragmatic choice for serious *autonomous* agent development, while the Mac Studio remains the king of *interactive* local coding assistance.",

For a typical coding task involving a 10,000-token context, my calculations show that while a high-compute system might start working five seconds faster, the more bandwidth-heavy system completes the generation phase significantly earlier. In multi-step agentic workflows where a model might output code across 50 iterations, the cumulative time saved during the 'typing' phase quickly renders any initial ingestion advantage irrelevant.\n\nCalculating the Total Timeline\n\nI am synthesizing a total execution model that adjudicates between starting fast and finishing fast. My findings indicate that in a typical programming loop involving 40 to 60 turns, the cumulative time saved during the actual writing of code blocks is the decisive factor. While a competitor might save five seconds on an initial file read, a system with triple the data throughput saves multiple seconds on every single response it generates. Over the course of a standard coding task, this generation advantage accumulates into a lead that no amount of initial processing speed can overcome.\n\nThe Ingestion vs. Generation Math\n\nI have been mathematically deconstructing the performance intersection when an agent reads new files mid-task. My calculations show that even when an agent pulls in a fresh 1,000-token block of code, a high-bandwidth system only needs to generate about 55 tokens of output to reach the finish line first. Given that professional coding agents frequently generate hundreds of tokens of refactored logic or debugging logs per turn, the 'typing' speed of the memory pipeline remains the definitive bottleneck for the total session time.",

The initial 2-second lag is instantly recovered by the blazing fast generation.\n* **Long Prompt / Short Response:** The Spark wins. If the task is \"Read this book and say 'Yes' or 'No',\" the Mac spends 20 seconds reading and 0.1 seconds answering. The Spark spends 5 seconds reading and 0.2 seconds answering.\n\n**Benchmark Synthesis:** The user's intuition that \"token generation speed will make up for the lack in prompt processing\" is mathematically correct for arguably 90% of interactive use cases (chat, coding, writing). The \"Prompt Processing\" advantage of the Spark is a specialized victory relevant primarily for massive RAG ingestion or batch processing, not the fluidity of conversation.   \n\n\"\n\n**Final Verdict:**\n\n* **DGX Spark is Faster When:** You are processing massive documents (long prompts), running batch classification jobs, fine-tuning models, or require native CUDA support for training.\n* **Mac Studio M3 Ultra is Faster When:** You are chatting, coding, writing, or interacting with the AI in real-time. The generation is smoother, the capacity (up to 512GB) is higher, and the latency per token is significantly lower.\n\nso yeah the mac studio wins for when ur trying to use an actual llm. u dont have to believe me, u can just go ask multiple spark and m3 mac studio owners to prove it. \n\n  \ndont even get me started on mlx kv cache reusing cuz at that point it just starts getting sad for the spark",

The flagship models are just impossible to beat with local hardware if you're into complex RPG-style scenarios and long narrative arcs.\n\nGood luck!",

Because of university, I couldn't update the project for a while, but now it’s almost finished! It’s now a full AI companion with object recognition (YOLO11n). I’m also working on face and voice recognition, so he can play games with you, and I plan to add robotic arms in the future.\n\nI hope you like it! All the faces were drawn by me. I’ll be adding more emotions and the canon green color soon. Right now it’s pink because my case is pink… lol\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qbwc35/video/w7tc1ylxa5dg1/player\n\n",

I’m undecided if I will add its own monitor like yours or just use a Tv when needed.",
