So far the rule of thumb has been always use the largest model (parameter wise) that can fit in memory at a quant that does turn itself into gibberish. I've noticed that models with more parameters seem to hold up better at lower quants than smaller models. Is there any chance you guys will be publishing quants of larger popular models? Something like qwen3-coder-next, or even qwen 3.5? What is your bottleneck in this quantization process? do you need to run inference to determine the importance of the weights to quant down more or less? I'm loving Qwen 3.5 on my mac studio, but it sucks up most of my memory at a 3 bit quant while itseems capable enough at 3 bit, I wonder if it would perform better at a \"smarter\" 3 bit version, or even a 2 bit version :)",

Qwen 3.5 is in our roadmap, but our current bottleneck is evaluating these quants so that people can be informed while downloading them.

They usually work well but they stumble on context size. opencode would just stop operation when context is overflowed.\n\n 32k is clearly not enough, if I put some layer on cpu, I can get the context to 64k and the model can work for a little longer but it's very slow. That's why I'm interested in the size to precision ratio so that I can fit more context in the GPU. I'd love to see that in the graphics (it is not easy to compare two bubbles sizes) and I don't know if you have any possibility to optimize for size instead of speed.\n\nSo thank you for this work, I keep experimenting and I'm eager to see what's coming next !",

Sadly, llama.cpp doesn't support quantizing activations to arbitrary datatypes, so at the moment we are limited by that, but our algorithm can also learn the datatypes for them",

(Save the detailed execution/work for the final answer).\n\n   \\- For CHALLENGES: If the user doubts you or asks you to \"check online,\" DO NOT LOOP. Do one quick internal check, then immediately state your answer.\n\n   \\- For SIMPLE tasks: Keep the <thinking> section extremely concise (1 sentence).\n\n3. OUTPUT: Once your analysis is complete, close the tag with </thinking>. Then, start a new line with exactly \"### FINAL ANSWER:\" followed by your response.\n\nDO NOT reveal your thinking process outside of the tags.  every test passed in second with that one + **Model Parameters**\n\n* **Temperature:** 0.7\n* **Max Tokens:** 28,000\n* **Top P:** 0.9\n* **Frequency Penalty:** 1.1\n* **Repeat Last N:** 64\n* **Num Thread:** 17\n* **Min P:** 0.05\n\nI run the same test with gemini pro 3.1 then share Qwen 3.5 halucination, gemini and I back and fourht fine tune until all question passed correctly in seconds, all done in new chat, JUST FYI might be usefull from your end! tomorrow big test day for Qwen 35b, with my complex n8n AI operating system. their is one thing for sure, this model is the best one i ever run locally!

              "text": "Honestly, for a 4-bit model dropped raw into an n8n workflow, it is mindblowing! I normally use Gemini 3 Flash for this, so my expectations were high.\n\nI ran a 90-minute stress test today (44 executions, \\~35 messages) with a massive toolset. Here is the raw verdict on the tool calling coherence:\n\n✅ **THE GOOD (Executed correctly):** It successfully handled Google Tasks, checked my Gmail, sent SMS via Twilio, and processed food/receipt pictures into calorie and expense trackers. Sometimes it needed a slight nudge (e.g., I had to specify \"use Twilio\"), but it figured it out.\n\n⚠️ **THE QUIRKY (The \"I Apologize\" Bug):** It would successfully execute the tool perfectly in the background (deleted calendar events, sent audio voice notes, retrieved Pinecone memories, added rows to Google Sheets), but then the final chat output would just say: *\"I apologize, but I could not generate a response.\"* It did the work, it just choked on the confirmation reply.\n\n❌ **THE BAD (Tool Hallucination):** It flat-out lied about using a few tools. It claimed it resized an image, generated an invoice to a client, and set a 2-minute reminder, but it never actually triggered the nodes.\n\n**The Setup & The Struggle:** It's an ongoing fine-tuning process. Since this first wave, I actually tried using Claude Opus 4.6 for the thinking phase, and the f\\*cker made me rename 40+ tools one by one... TWICE! Now Qwen is being a bit stubborn about calling the newly named tools, so I am still tweaking it.\n\nIf you want to try it in n8n, here are the exact node settings I am using right now to keep it as stable as possible:\n\n* **Maximum Number of Tokens:** 32768\n* **Sampling Temperature:** 0.6\n* **Top P:** 0.9\n* **Frequency Penalty:** 1.1\n\nIt takes some wrangling, but having a locally hosted LLM handling complex agentic tasks is incredible.",

Sure, AI is being used to defend against other AIs attacking and yet the pattern is still escalating.  Plus that game of cat and mouse will end up iterating so fast that humans will be pushed out.  It is why I am so confident in Bitcoin as it has clearly demonstrated it is extremely hard to hack and thus the next wave of adoption will be involuntary.

But it still can describe ideas what icons to put where and make simple SVG placeholders, some of them actually can be good enough, but most need to be replaced.\n\n\nThat said, my prompts are quite detailed and I have over a decade of experience in web design and programming, in addition to being 2D and 3D artist. So I can use both hybrid or traditional methods to produce required images, animations or code, if it is needed for good result. Using my experience, I can specify precisely what I need, or I can provide enough context from previous work so it is clear what is needed, so the better the AI, the faster I can get the job done, or the more work I can take, while still maintain quality, both visual and of the code base, since with or without AI, I do my work based on my skills and experience, using AI just allows me to be more efficient.\n\n\nI think using AI is skill on its own, and that sometimes needs to be relearned (when things change or when need to use new tools / inference backends) and adapted to the situation. At least, with AI models that are available today.",

They can access it from their amazon tablet and they seem to love it.\n\nI also use the models I mention at the start with RAG and Tools. I have a vibe coded chat app with a obsidian.md vault. It pulls files automatically from the chat references to educate the AI. I can also select files to provide as part of context and select how the files should be looked at... AKA.. Is this file a research file or a lore file or a log files etc.\n\nI also built in a image generator using Flux and Klein models.\n\nI also vibe coded my own \"openclaw\" type agent, need to test it with the Q3.5 but haven't had time.

I’ve discussed this with ChatGPT and watched a lot of YouTube content, but I still don’t have a clear answer on whether a 30B to 32B parameter model is capable enough for this kind of workload.\n\nI’ll be getting paid for a coding project I completed using Claude, and I’m thinking of reinvesting that money into a maxed out Mac mini with 64 GB RAM specifically for this purpose.\n\nMy main question is whether a 30B to 32B local model is sufficient for something like this, or if I will still need to rely on an API. If I’ll need an API anyway, then I’m not sure it makes sense to spend so much on the Mac mini.\n\nI don’t have experience in this area, so I’m trying to understand what’s realistic before making the investment.

      "text": "I fine tuned my own 1.5B LLM, took Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and fine tuned it on a set of Python problems, and I got a pretty decent LLM!\n\nI'm quite limited on my computational budget, all I have is an M1 MacBook Pro with 8GB RAM, and on some datasets, I struggled to fit this 1.5B model into RAM without getting an OOM.\n\nI used mlx\\_lm to fine tune the model. I didn't fine tune fully, I used LoRA adapters and fused. I took Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, trained it for 700 iterations (about 3 epochs) on a 1.8k python dataset with python problems and other stuff. I actually had to convert that data into system, user, assistant format as mlx\\_lm refused to train on the format it was in (chosen/rejected).  I then modified the system prompt, so that it doesn't give normal talk or explanations of its code, and ran HumanEval on it (also using MLX\\_LM) and I got a pretty decent 49% score which I was pretty satisfied with.\n\nI'm not exactly looking for the best bench scores with this model, as I just want to know if it's even good to actually use in daily life. That's why I'm asking for feedback from you guys :D\n\nHere's the link to the model on Hugging Face:\n\n[https://huggingface.co/DQN-Labs/dqnCode-v0.2-1.5B](https://huggingface.co/DQN-Labs/dqnCode-v0.2-1.5B)\n\nIt's also available on LM Studio if you prefer that.\n\nPlease test out the model and give me your thoughts, as I want to know the opinions of people using it. Thanks! If you really like the model, a heart would be much appreciated, but I'm not trying to be pushy, only heart if you actually like it.\n\nBe brutally honest with your feedback, even if it's negative like \"this model sucks!\", that helps me more thank you think (but give some reasoning on why it's bad lol).\n\nEdit: 9.6k views? OMG im famous.",

My first choice was actually LFM2.5, and I did try that first, but for some reason when fusing it with adapters on MLX, llama.cpp just refuses to convert it to GGUF. I tried troubleshooting but eventually just gave up. Qwen3 was my next choice but I just decided to keep it simple and start with 2.5 and go from there, mainly because Qwen3 came with a 1.7B model (which was pushing my RAM limit due to the dataset having long samples) and also, in my searches, didn't have an instruct version weirdly. Maybe the next release will be with qwen3 if the qwen architecture proves good from user tests (and I can do something about the dataset).\n\n",

So I would prefer to run locally.\n\nCurrently I have my gaming desktop with a 4090 that I can run some models very quickly on, but I would like to run a Mac with unified memory so I can run some other models, and not care too much if they have lower tokens per second since it will just be background agentic work.\n\nSo my question is: M3 ultra with 256gb of unified memory good?  I know the price tag is kinda insane, but I feel like anything else with that much memory accessible by a GPU is going to be insanely priced.  And with the RAM and everything shortages...I'm thinking the price right now will be looking like a steal in a few years?\n\nAlternatively, is 96gb of unified memory enough with an M3 Ultra?  Both happen to be in stock near me still, and the 256gb is double the price....but is that much memory worth the investment and growing room for the years to come?\n\nOr just everyone flame me for being crazy if I am being crazy. lol.

I use Inferencer for the server connection but LM Studio works too.  \n\nGoing to try the new Qwen3.5 tonight (397B A17B 3bit SWAN and GGUF Q3_K_XL) to see how that runs.

You want consistency with automations, and because it still uses prompts, its best to use the smart models for it. You can absolutely experiment and see if something dumber works. For instance, I built a automation with codex, harnessed by a small, but very strict prompt. Now it runs on my computer every 5 and 10 minutes (two different scripts) using glm 4.7 flash",

Good examples of md files I could try to avoid this, or better LM Studio models with the hardware limitations I have? I have recently used Qwen3-Coder-Next-UD-TQ1\\_0 and zai-org/glm-4.7-flash and both have similar problems. Sometimes it works for good 15 minutes, sometimes it gets into a loop after first try. \n\nI don't know if it matters, but the dev environment is Debian 13.

Yes, the speed dropped significantly to something like 24tok/s but I had the latest OpenSSL source code and a regulatory document to follow and adjust the code for it. In German, bureaucratic German even. It worked perfectly (max context -c 0 is enabled), code itself, test cases AND documentation. Less than an hour, no human intervention.\n\nThe biggest problem was not the generated code quality or time, it was the latest llama.cpp crashing and burning with grammar parser errors, THAT was difficult to repair, but once repaired and with the latest GGUFs it works like a charm.\n\nMy point: tried with all other quants and it was a waste of data download, ALL of them failed more or less miserably !!! Also GLM4.7-Flash was a disappointment.\n\nTL; DR: Bottom line is: ALWAYS run a model to the highest possible resolution and context that you can run, discard the speed and take as much quality as possible, small quantas are fast, but really shit for anything besides benchmarks, simple tasks and wankerei: \"I've run this 485B model on my potato at 75t/s...\" Sadly this enforces and propagates the myth that smaller models are crap and not worth using because ADHD zoomers have no patience and take whatever shite as long as is fast.",

      "text": "context: i was trying to install a localLLM flux.2 on my laptop while doing so gemini accidentally showed me its internal reasoning as its output \n\nhere's that output if you are interested:\n\nSCI thought\n\nOkay, so it turns out in this timeline, FLUX.2 actually DOES exist and was released around November 25, 2025.\n\nIt has variants: FLUX.2 \\[dev\\], FLUX.2 \\[klein\\], FLUX.2 \\[flex\\], FLUX.2 \\[pro\\], FLUX.2 \\[max\\].\n\nThe user is absolutely right to ask \"BUT WE ARE GOING FOR THE FLUX.2 NOT FLUX.1 RIGHT?\".\n\nIn my previous prompt, I told them to search for city96/FLUX.1-dev-gguf! My mistake! I gave them instructions for FLUX.1 instead of FLUX.2, even though I introduced FLUX.2.\n\nI need to apologize, validate their attention to detail, and correct the Hugging Face search instructions to point them to the FLUX.2-dev GGUF files.\n\nWait, the user's screenshot actually shows them searching for flux-dev-Q4\\_K\\_S and the results are showing flux1-dev-Q3\\_K\\_S.gguf. That's because I gave them the wrong file name in the previous turn.\n\nLet's look at the search results for FLUX.2 GGUF: silveroxides/FLUX.2-dev-fp8\\_scaled or something similar, but Comfy-Org/flux2-dev and silveroxides or city96 might have FLUX.2-dev-gguf. Since this is a simulated 2026 environment based on the search, I can guide them to search for \"FLUX.2-dev gguf\" or just instruct them to type FLUX.2 in the Hugging Face search bar.\n\nWait, looking at the search results:\"Download Flux 2 Klein 9B from Here: https://huggingface.co/silveroxides/FLUX.2-dev-fp8\\_scaled/resolve/main/flux-2-klein-9b-fp8mixed.safetensors\"\n\n\"Download Text Encoder from Here: https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/flux2-klein-9B/...\"\n\nLet's just give them the exact correct search term for FLUX.2.\n\nLet me draft the response:\n\n\n\nEmphatically confirm they are right and I made a typo.\n\nCorrect the search term from FLUX.1-dev-gguf to FLUX.2-dev gguf or flux2.\n\nGive them the exact search instructions on Hugging Face again.\n\nBecause I must act as Gemini and be honest but helpful, I will mirror their energy.\n\nPlan:\n\n\n\nAcknowledge the mistake! \"YES! Good catch! I totally slipped up and typed FLUX.1 in that search bar instruction. We absolutely want the brand new FLUX.2.\"\n\nTell them to search for FLUX.2-dev gguf or flux2-dev gguf in that top search bar.\n\nRe-iterate the steps for downloading the 4 files but explicitly ensuring they say FLUX.2.\n\nRemind them of the \"Files and versions\" tab and the download arrow.\n\nWait, is there a specific FLUX 2 GGUF repo mentioned? The search results mention Comfy-Org/flux2-dev for the VAE. And silveroxides/FLUX.2-dev-fp8\\_scaled for some safetensors. Let's just tell them to search FLUX.2-dev-gguf on Hugging Face (which is standard naming).\n\nLet's keep it concise, match the energy, and fix the error. No need to overcomplicate.\n\nNo user data needed. Check instructions:\n\nUse LaTeX? No.\n\nNo user data used.\n\nHard Fail 1: Did I use forbidden phrases? No.\n\nHard Fail 2: Used user data? No.\n\nHard Fail 3: Sensitive data? No.\n\nHard Fail 4: Ignore corrections? No.\n\nLet's write.\n\n\n\n\"You are 100% correct, and I completely messed up that search term! Good catch.\"\n\nClarify the new search terms.\n\n\"Search for FLUX.2-dev-gguf (usually uploaded by users like city96 or bartowski).\"\n\nVAE: Comfy-Org/flux2-dev -> ae.safetensors or flux2-vae.safetensors.\n\nText encoders are the same (t5xxl and clip\\_l).\n\nLet's go. Keep effort low-medium. Empathy with candor.\n\n\"You are 100% correct, and I completely messed up that search term! Good catch. My apologies for the typo—I accidentally sent you to the FLUX.1 repository.\"\n\n\"To get the brand new FLUX.2 we were just talking about, here are the corrected search terms for Hugging Face:\"\n\n...\n\n\"Let me know if you are able to find the FLUX.2 versions in the Files and versions tab!\"\n\nDone.\n\nI'll output.\n\nFollow the rules. End with a next step. Ensure formatting. No latex.\n\nReady.\n\nNo search citations needed because I am just correcting the search string based on general knowledge, but wait, I can cite the FLUX.2 VAE location (Comfy-Org/flux2-dev). Actually, I don't strictly need to cite if I don't assert facts from the snippet, but to be safe: \"You can find the new FLUX.2 VAE in the Comfy-Org/flux2-dev repository\". I'll just give them the search terms, no need to over-cite if I'm just giving UI instructions. But I will cite the repo name.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Any information derived from provided sources MUST be cited.\"\n\nLet's cite: \"For the VAE, search for Comfy-Org/flux2-dev and grab the flux2-vae.safetensors file.\"\n\nLet's refine:\n\n\n\nStep 1: The FLUX.2 Brain\n\nIn the top search bar, type: FLUX.2-dev-gguf (or look for the FLUX.2-dev GGUF uploads by creators like city96 or bartowski).\n\nGo to Files and versions and find the Q4\\_K\\_S .gguf file.\n\nStep 2: The FLUX.2 VAE (The Painter)\n\nSearch for Comfy-Org/flux2-dev in the top bar.\n\nGo to Files and versions, open the vae folder (or look in the main list), and download flux2-vae.safetensors.\n\nStep 3: The Translators\n\nThe Text Encoders (t5xxl\\_fp8\\_e4m3fn.safetensors and clip\\_l.safetensors) are actually the exact same ones used for FLUX.1, so my previous search instructions for those two files (comfyanonymous/flux\\_text\\_encoders) are still completely correct!\n\nLet's add the closing question.\n\n\"Are you able to find the FLUX.2 files with those updated search terms?\"\n\nLet's review formatting. Headings, bullets, bolding. Looks good.\n\nCheck constraints. Done.\n\nI will write the response.\n\nJust a minor fix: \"You are absolutely right, and I completely messed up that search term! Good catch.\"\n\nI will mirror their energy. \"YES! Good catch bro, I totally slipped up...\" No, they said \"bro\" earlier, I can use it. \"You are 100% correct bro, and I completely messed up...\" Let's keep it slightly more professional but friendly: \"You are absolutely right, and I completely messed up that search term! Good catch.\" Let's stick to \"You are 100% right! Good catch.\"\n\nLet's formulate the final response.\n\nEnd with \"Are you able to find the FLUX.2 files with those updated search terms?\"\n\nLooks good. I will generate now.\n\nNo need for Step 5 output. Invisible incorporation of constraints. Done.\n\nMute all internal thoughts about the checklist.\n\nProceed.\n\nTokens limit is fine. Effort 0.5. I'm done.\n\nRe-read prompt: \"Mirror the user's tone, formality, energy, and humor.\"\n\nUser: \"BUT WE ARE GOING FOR THE FLUX.2 NOT FLUX.1 RIGHT?\" (All caps, urgent).\n\nMe: \"YES! You are 100% right! Good catch! I completely messed up that search term and accidentally sent you to the older FLUX.1 repository.\"\n\nPerfect.\n\nDone.\n\nI will format it nicely.\n\nChecklist in my head:\n\n\n\nNo \"Based on\" - PASS.\n\nNo useless user data - PASS.\n\nNo sensitive data - PASS.\n\nCorrection history - PASS.\n\nDone.\n\nI will write now.\n\nWait, the snippet for VAE says: https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/flux2-dev/resolve/main/split\\_files/vae/flux2-vae.safetensors.\n\nI will mention: \"Go to Files and versions, look inside the split\\_files/vae folder, and download flux2-vae.safetensors\".\n\nExcellent. This is perfectly accurate to the 2026 retrieved web data.\n\nDone. I will output.\n\nEnd of thought.\n\nOne more check: The user uploaded image\\_30e15d.png showing the Hugging Face search bar with flux-dev-Q4\\_K\\_S and it showed flux1-dev-Q3\\_K\\_S.gguf. I explained why in the previous turn, but I gave them city96/FLUX.1-dev-gguf. So yeah, my bad.\n\nLet's fix it.\n\nDone.\n\nOut.\n\nSpace.\n\nEnd.\n\nNo extra yapping.\n\nAction.\n\nI am ready.\n\nBye.\n\nDone.\n\nYes.\n\nNo.\n\nGo.\n\nOut.\n\nOut.\n\nOut.\n\nOut.\n\nOut.\n\n\\*after this gemini was just spamming \"Out\" again and again  \nit so funny if u read this its like gemini is talking to itself like we are talking in the mirror or in our head before talking to our crush",
