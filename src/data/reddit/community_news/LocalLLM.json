      "text": "I keep coming back to the idea of running AI locally you know, like a GPT-style assistant that just works on your own device without the internet or Wifi connection?\n\nNot to build anything serious or commercial. I just like the idea of being able to read my own files, understand things or think stuff through without relying on cloud services all the time. Especially when there is no connection, internet services change or when things gets locked behind paywalls.\n\nEvery time I try local setups though, it feels more complicated than it should be. The models work, but the tools feel rough and it’s easy to get lost tweaking things when you just want something usable.\n\nI'm just curious if anyone here actually uses offline AI day to day or if most people try it once and move on. I would really be interesting to hear what worked and what didn’t.",

Then there is Ollama which also runs locally and you can search for Models on ollama Web Page and how to. Then there is openwebUI which is Local Web UI which runs locally and Access to UI via Browser and it Looks more Like ChatGPT but you have the control, you can combine this with ComfyUI to generate images too but it’s more complicated. There are many other options available and above one are just a tiny bit of Tipps and easy ways.",

But this also can be solved.\n\nFor Video + Audio Like Sora there is LTX2 which runs locally but as said depends on gpu and ram.

My token context is 128000 and batching at 10000. It’s absolutely prosumer grade. People who want the utmost speed should just pay for Anthropic or Gemini. Unless you have massive budget backed by enterprise of some sort these are the trade offs you have to make.

When I reach out to the seller, they’ll send me confidential documents like bank statements and tax returns etc. I can drop those into a documents page on the system Claude code built and have it run a local analysis with qwen3. I worked with Claude code to explain what the analysis should do and it made them leaps and bounds more detailed than what I would ask for. So Claude code built out all the prompts of how the documents get loaded in and then what it asks for from qwen. It was having issues with context windows (eg loading in 12 bank statements or more) so Claude code built a way to chunk those out, get a response and then feed that response back in with the next set to get a full and accurate analysis. Qwen makes minor mistakes but Claude has been able to understand them and tweak them.",

It might not be a 1:1 exact, but if you have patience to set up the moving parts, front end, back end, tool calling, etc., the result can accomplish 95-98% of what chatGPT can do. Feedback I've received has actually been that the primary users \"prefer\" the new local alternative over chatGPT, citing that chatGPT is slower for things like image gen/edits with not enough variation in art style, and can be more finicky understanding prompts if the user is not a strong English speaker.\n\nIt comes with an initial startup cost and probably some technical aptitude, but it can absolutely be done.",

Then there will be an influx of 1-click setup tools and guides.\n\nHonestly, I've been loving all the exploration and learning with the past couple of trends, but I'll admit, it's a bit much to keep up with. I don't know, maybe I'm just crazy at this point.\n\nThoughts?",

Also, killing a fly with a bazooka isn't a sign of intelligence, so most people don't need a 1tb dense model to find a recipe. \nPrivacy concern is real. \nSkilling/ reskilling concern is real too. \nIt would be intelligent to develop skills and work flows to know when to use local compute, and maybe, when you really do need speed or compute, use the cloud. But running a dense pro model for every prompt sounds dumb, wasteful, and only sensible from the perspective of the cloud provider that's charging you per token irrespective of the slop you make. \nOne fear I have: letting a model running on the cloud overnight working on some multi step task to wake up to a large bill with garbage to show for.

We can get Local LLMs running and it might be enough for 90% or users. \n\nWhy would you share your Personal information with AI companies who will use it against you to show you/ manipulate you with Ads and other products !??\n\n\nNot just data, the offerings of AI APIs and services are very questionable:\n1. Customers of Perplexity paid for Pro account (advertised to have limit of 2000 research questions) noticed they have reduced the limit now tor 20. How a company can change the limits of a product after customers paid for  it is still unclear, but it’s happening.\n\n2. companies change the underlying model running behind the Chat Apps to lower quality model without telling us to save costs. Customers notice degradation in models few weeks after the model has generated buzz and captured attention.\n\nAll of this is happening and  the only way to have some control over your AI experience/access is to run your own model locally.\n\n\nHere’s some ideas for Private and Local AI uses:\n[Local AI playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmBiQSpo5XuQKaKGgoiPFFt_Jfvp3oioV)",

And I would say it's the best option to be 100% honest.

They can be found on ebay for about $250 bucks right now.\n\nThe card is passively cooled and designed for a server rack, so I made a custom cooling shroud to force air into the back and through it like it would work in a server race. On the back is a PWM high pressure fan, controlled by my motherboard, and the speed is directly bound to the tesla's temperature through nvidia-smi and FanControl on Windows.\n\nBought a big ass PC case, cut a big chunk out of the back. Got myself an 8 pin server card adapter to dual 6 pin GPU power outputs from a PSU, and got myself a nice big ass PSU. Fired the whole thing up as a Frankenstein design.\n\nI wouldn't call it fast by any means, but in 4bit quant I can fit gpt-oss 20b in there with 32k+ context length, all on the GPU. The speeds are fast enough to be used as a local chatbot, so works well as my AI assistant. Also, works with CUDA 12 if you pick the right driver.\n\n  \nOh, I forgot to mention, this thing has no video output, as it's a server accelerator card. I have a Ryzen 5700G as my processor, with integrated graphics. The Tesla is driver hacked into registering as a nVidia Quadro in workstation mode, and so I can run games on the Tesla using the windows settings for high performance graphics (meant to be used on gaming laptops with GPUs) and it gets relayed through my integrated GPU. The actual die on this card is a clone of the 1080ti, so I get 1080ti performance gaming too, just with 24 gigs of VRAM, and it'll run anything as long as I put the game's exe in a list. I'm most proud of that part of the setup.\n\n[The TESLA running in my rig](https://preview.redd.it/xodlgmmphxhg1.png?width=4624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7adaaf3f9eaed0dee176343d18e12a534af33bd8)\n\n[Underside View](https://preview.redd.it/u2ftaa3shxhg1.png?width=4624&format=png&auto=webp&s=642d7b83a028dd6b268a16c6a6241f2dcd4feb05)\n\n[closer look at the cooling solution and power adapter](https://preview.redd.it/up5colythxhg1.png?width=3472&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d15f0ddcf217b939ca2f806dad6d97043afd36e)",

When that happens I notice I subconsciously start “using the AI more carefully”, shorter prompts, fewer refactors, less exploration. It kind of kills the flow.\n\nSo I started wondering:\n\nWould it actually be cheaper (or at least more comfortable) to just build a beefy local machine, run a local LLM, and hook that directly into my IDE?\n\nIn theory that sounds very appealing:\n\n* One-time hardware cost\n* No token anxiety\n* Unlimited usage\n* Fully private codebase\n* IDE → LLM loop as tight as possible\n\nBut I’m unsure how realistic this is *today*.\n\nSome concrete questions:\n\n* Does this actually work well in practice for real coding tasks (refactoring, understanding large codebases, generating tests, etc.)?\n* Which local models are “not too dumb” for serious dev work? (Code Llama? DeepSeek-Coder? Qwen-Coder? Mixtral variants?)\n* What kind of hardware are we realistically talking about? (Single high-end GPU? Dual GPU? 64–128GB RAM?)\n* How painful is the IDE integration compared to Cursor / Copilot? (Latency, context handling, indexing, etc.)\n* In the long run: is this actually cheaper, or just a fun rabbit hole?\n\nI don’t expect local models to beat GPT-4o / Claude at everything, but if I could get to “good enough” with zero limits and full privacy, that feels like a big win.\n\nCurious to hear from people who’ve actually tried this setup in daily work.  \nWorth it, or not there yet?\n\nThanks!",

Actually, this is also an interesting question from the computer science perspective. I don't have an answer, but several naive alternatives come to mind:  \n\\- You could replicated the code (just make multiple copies on the disk) and run Ralph loop for n iterations. If none of the replicas can pass the test (assuming you would have specified/generated one for a certain feature), you could decide that this is indeed \"hard stuff\"  \n\\- You could use the local model itself (or another local model as a judge), give it the code base and the prompt/task, and ask it to decide whether it's simple enough to solve it locally or whether a bigger, non-local model should be invoked  \n\\- You could use a heuristic. For example, you could create some kind of a \"balanced score card\" with different categories such as \"the number of files that would need to be changed to complete the task\", \"the number of functions that would need to be changed\", \"total cyclomatic complexity of these functions or files\", etc. Based on the values in the individual categories of that \"balanced score card\" (or a lumped sum) you could decide whether the change is \"hard stuff\" or not",

If you ask an agent for this\n\nStep 1 - look for reference of objects in original code block and then find their declaration.\n\nStep 2 - look for required reference in your new class and find the dependencies.\n\nStep 3 - Send the referenced code to LLM and get back your expected code block.\n\nNow I think most of the tokens are consumed during step 1 and 2. While that can be done with help of your local LLM as well. So you can use it for reading code finding actual references then generate a proper prompt for actual GPT 5 or Gemini or whatever you prefer.\n\nJust like these you can prepare multiple prompts for you to use them as needed.\n\nNow just to be clear this is my opinion and there might be other options as well. Let us know whatever you settle with.",

Assuming he's referring to `Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct` and `GLM-4.7-Flash`, the models themselves take about ~18-19GB of VRAM (assuming 4-bit quantization), but that's before you factor in room for context. Context windows is where memory gets tricky.\n\nI have 24GB of VRAM (5060Ti 16GB + 3060Ti 8GB) and have been able to get about ~20K tokens of context on each of these in LM Studio (basically easy mode). According to Gemini, it estimates ~40GB of VRAM to fit 128k context but that might assume some (not necessarily easy) optimizations. Worth noting that GLM's context is a bit more memory-efficient than Qwen, but also it's a thinking model and Qwen Coder isn't so Qwen is more token-efficient.\n\nNot much can be done about the model size itself without sacrificing quality, but there are some optimizations that can help you squeeze in a bit more context if you're willing to stray away from the \"easy mode\" setup.",

Newer models get released fairly frequently that keep on raising the bar.\n\nIt's a difficult question to answer though, as I'm sure you know, one model may suck at one task while another is hitting hole runs on the same task.  The advantage of a local machine is that you can quickly flip between models without needing to have a half dozen subscriptions.\n\nSo, privacy wise, always worth it. Budget wise, it depends. Access to the best and latest models wise, you'll have to accept that you're always maybe six months behind the capabilities of the online models (very rough hand wavy guess), but this can be mitigated somewhat with model flexibility.

Running a local LLM could potentially be cheaper than relying on cloud-based AI services, especially if you have the hardware and expertise to set it up. The tradeoff is the additional overhead and maintenance required. Ultimately, it depends on your specific needs, usage patterns, and the performance requirements of your codebase. I'd suggest doing some cost analysis and benchmarking to see which option makes the most sense for your workflow.",

Afaik, sweet spot is moe model fitting on 128gb ram. The penalty seems to be 5-25pc performance, and what that means in practice is anybody's guess, there's no standard.

It's decent!\n\nThe tasks I tested were pretty simple, just some small refactoring in my toy project and fixing one bug. But that's exactly the point, for these kind of everyday coding tasks, you ain't gonna need Opus 4.6 level of intelligence, a \"small and sweet\" open source model is usually good enough.\n\nI feel like 80b model is a sweet spot for GX10 with 128GB of GPU memory, 8-bit quantized models could be comfortably loaded into the GPU. For comparison between the two devices, you can clearly see M3 ultra gives a higher throughput, but it's 3x the price of GX10.\n\nDo you think going local will be the coming trend?",

Is there some sort of good - better - best (with ballpark prices or not) for nominally consumer-available GPUs (and whatever else matters)? I'm wondering specifically if 48GB is a useful sweet spot, and if so, is there a meaningful performance difference between buying two 24GB cards and just one 48GB card.\n\nIs there a guide to these things that folks keep up to date a la the NUC buyer's guide/spreadsheet? I could of course ask (and have asked) the commercial LLMs themselves, but I'm never sure what they're wrong about or leaving out.",

Of course the huge models would perform better for tool-calling, but for me the marginal improvements does not justify the huge costs of hardware.\n\n- 2x24GB VRAM can run the same models as single 48GB VRAM.\n- generally higher the VRAM the larger models you can run\n\nPrices are skyrocketing.

          "text": "I have a question, I know Claw is a security nightare but I dont need it to do half the things people say it could. I essentaill want a bot that can help me to research on thing. Example: I'll talk to Grok (yea I know, but if I need spicy, I go there, everythign else is Gemini for anythign serious) and will discuss something I saw on youtube, like a new LLM or API or whatever. Like the new Nvidia Personoplex. I woudl like to have the bot go and research it for me, check the gitgub and see if it can be intergrated into itself. Obviously, this is an extreme situation, but along these lines. \n\n  \nThe reason why I thought this was possible was becasue I was tryign to get it to work with discord so I can talk to it that way, and when I was testing it via Claude Opus, I asked it to help me configure it so it would work the way I wanted to. It just did it. And when it hit problems, it kept trying things, which is GREAT, however, the openwebui credits I have for over a year of 4.35c that I've been using that lasted me forever, was drained in minutes to .35c apparently soakign though hundreds of thousands of tokens. Which is nuts.\n\n  \nSo my take is, claude is great and works as advertised, at the cost of a liver and partial kidney per hour. I realize there isnt a comparable model that's open source, but I'm wondering if I can get close? With those abilities? My rig is pretty basic, I have an older Gigabyte X99P-sli Motherbaord with 225gb of ram, that has pci 3x slots and dual rtx 5090's that I use for minecraft, with ollama, so I have 64gb of pooled vram using ollama. I get about 30tps usign a 70b model. Which im guessign inhundreds if times slower than the cloud API.\n\n  \nAm I just dreaming here? Would a machien like DGX spark make a better machine? I'm guess it probably wouldnt as it just has x2 the vram and nothing would change other than the model and maybe a lower tps even. And yes I knwo giving it access to this machine is dangerous, Ive installed it closed wsl enviorment. I dont plan to give it access to anything and stricly want to use it as a chat bot springboard research assistant. I manage my own calendar.\n\nAm I wasting my time? Thanks for the advice in advance.\n\n![gif](giphy|1D7ryE8SDYuq8kGGGQ)",

The goal was simple: make something that runs locally, fits in a browser extension, and doesn't require sending your text anywhere.\n\n\\*\\*The approach:\\*\\*\n\nWe used knowledge distillation to compress a 120B teacher model into Gemma 3 270M. The base Gemma model scores \\~40% on our test set (random guessing on binary classification). After fine-tuning with \\~10k examples distilled from the teacher, the student matches teacher performance on held-out data.\n\nTraining data was based on the \\[Kaggle AI-generated essays dataset\\](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denvermagtibay/ai-generated-essays-dataset), expanded via distillation. So the model is specifically tuned for that style of content, though it generalizes reasonably well to other formats.\n\nFor browser deployment, we quantized to Q4\\_K\\_M (\\~242 MB). Accuracy drops from 100% to \\~95% on our test set - that's the tradeoff for fitting in a Chrome extension.\n\n\\*\\*Results:\\*\\*\n\n| Model | Size | Test Accuracy |  \n|-------|------|---------------|  \n| GPT OSS 120B (teacher) | \\~120B | 100% (20/20) |  \n| Gemma 3 270M (fine-tuned) | 270M | 100% (20/20) |  \n| Gemma 3 270M Q4\\_K\\_M | \\~242 MB | 95% (19/20) |  \n| Gemma 3 270M (base) | 270M | \\~40% |\n\nReal-world testing on content outside the training domain:\n\n| Content Type | Accuracy |  \n|--------------|----------|  \n| ChatGPT outputs (n=50) | 98% |  \n| Human tweets (n=50) | 94% |  \n| Reddit comments (n=100+) | \\~92% |  \n| Formal emails (n=30) | 88% |\n\nFormal human writing (business emails, academic text) is where it struggles most - too much stylistic overlap with AI output.\n\n\\*\\*Limitations:\\*\\*\n\n\\- \\~1 in 20 predictions wrong after quantization  \n\\- Trained on essays, so may miss AI patterns in other domains  \n\\- Formal human writing triggers false positives  \n\\- First load downloads \\~253 MB (cached after)  \n\\- Inference \\~0.5-2s on CPU\n\n\\*\\*Tech stack:\\*\\*\n\nThe extension runs via \\[Wllama\\](https://github.com/niconielsen32/wllama) (llama.cpp in WebAssembly). No API calls, works offline after initial model download.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI want to share a hobby project I’ve been building: **Unlimited Possibilities Framework (UPF)** — a local‑first, stateful RPG engine driven by LLMs.\n\nI’m **not a programmer by trade**. This started as a personal project to **help me learn how to program**, and it slowly grew into something I felt worth sharing. It’s still a **beta**, but it’s already playable and surprisingly stable.\n\n# What it is\n\nUPF isn’t a chat UI. It’s an **RPG engine** with actual **game state** that the LLM can’t directly mutate. The LLM proposes changes; the engine applies them via structured events. That means:\n\n* **Party members, quests, inventory, NPCs, factions, etc.** are tracked in state.\n* Changes are applied through JSON events, so the game doesn’t “forget” the world.\n* It’s local‑first, inspectable, and designed to stay coherent as the story grows.\n\n# Why you might want it\n\nIf you love emergent storytelling but hate losing context, this is the point:\n\n* The engine **removes reliance on context** by keeping the world in a structured state.\n* You can **lock fields** you don’t want the LLM to overwrite.\n* It’s built for long‑form campaigns, not just short chats.\n* You get RPG‑like continuity without writing a full game.\n\n# Backends\n\nMy **favourite backend is LM Studio**, and that’s why it’s the priority in the app, but you can also use:\n\n* **text-generation-webui**\n* **Ollama**\n\n# Model guidance (important)\n\nI’ve tested with models **under 12B** and I **strongly recommend not using them**. The whole point of UPF is to reduce reliance on context, not to force tiny models to hallucinate their way through a story. You’ll get the best results if you use your **favorite 12B+ model**.\n\n# Why I’m sharing\n\nThis has been a learning project for me and I’d love to see other people build worlds with it, break it, and improve it. If you try it, I’d love feedback — especially around model setup and story quality.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, this is my repo  \n[https://github.com/Gohzio/Unlimited\\_possibilies\\_framework](https://github.com/Gohzio/Unlimited_possibilies_framework)\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEdit: I've made a significant update to the consistency of RPG output rules. I strongly recommend you use the JSON schema in LM studio. I know Ollama has this functionality to but I have not tested it.\n\nModels, I have found instruction models ironically fail to follow instructions and actively try to fight the instructions from my framework. Thinking models are also pretty unreliable.\n\nThe best models are usually compound models made for roleplay 12-14b parameters with massive single message context lengths. I recommend uncensored models not because of it's ability to create lewd stories but because they have fewer refusals (none mostly). You can happily play a Lich and suck the souls out of villagers without the model having a conniption.  \nI am hesitant to post a link to a NSFW model because it's not actual the reason I made the app. Feel free to message me for some recommendations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8817b4fqwnig1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e83f62b646baff084265731b8bc2b926b993f48\n\n",

I did something similar, I've been experimenting in AI Studio since April doing a lot of this.\n\nI have Custom Instructions for the game play and found that systems it's really familiar with like d20 work better than bespoke ones. I then drag and drop RAG files as plain text and JSON and haven't had much trouble with one more than the other. I tell it to rely on python for the math and then relate it narratively for \"critical failure, failure, success, critical success\" However it doesn't really work out. It won't let a character lose.\n\nI have had tones of problem with things like tone and consistent character \"voice\". As it plays out it changes format for game state. It has problems with context bleed and context rot especially at token lengths over 150-200k tokens or so.\n\nHow does this compare?",

Second I tried splitting the processing to a back end server type thing but the processing power needed started to ramp up and basically only would work if you connected it to chat gpt or something and had massive context lengths (literally the opposite to what I wanted)\n\nWith this I started with 100% Rust and tried to make the LLM output tags for everything so the engine could read them and process them accordingly. This was the best yet but my keywords list went straight over 300 words and still missed stuff due to how conversations work.\n\nThat's when I read about context requests  in the open ai format. I pivoted to that and it works amazingly. The LLM doesn't need to remember a damn thing it just requests the information it needs to build an output. So then the world data is basically the system prompt and the engine combines the players input and relevant data from the player tab and if the LLM needs to know something like how loot drops work it will just request that data adding delay but removing context needs and so far the LLM has stayed sane.\n\nI've gotten as far as I can in solo testing and as I neither know anyone on Linux or with a GPU as powerful as mine (5080) I decided to let Reddit destroy me 😂.",

          "text": "People don't always realize clustering is good for parallel tasks, not single-stream inference. Splitting one model across multiple nodes means every layer boundary ships activations over the network. On 10GbE that's about 1.25 GB/s. Your nodes spend more time waiting on each other than doing math. You end up slower than a single fat node. \n\nThat said someone in this thread mentioned InfiniBand between two Strix Halo boxes and that actually offloads this bottleneck significantly. Used ConnectX-4/5 EDR cards run about $150-200 each and give you 100 Gbps, roughly 11 GB/s actual throughput with RDMA. That's 9x faster than 10GbE and makes tensor parallelism viable. 256GB unified memory across two nodes, 470B models at Q4, about $4,500 total. Interesting build. \n\nBut for a single $5K box? Mac Studio M4 Max. 128GB. $3,499.\n\n400 GB/s memory bandwidth, 128GB unified so no VRAM ceiling, silent, low power. Q3CN (80B MoE) would do roughly 40-60 tok/s. Most open models through 2026 will fit in 128GB quantized.\n\nThe RTX 5090 has insane bandwidth (about 1,800 GB/s) but only 32GB VRAM. Anything that fits in 32GB will scream. Anything that doesn't, and that's most of the interesting models, won't run at all without spilling to system RAM and tanking performance.\n\nThe M3 Ultra is last gen. Wait for the M4 Ultra if you want 256GB+ unified but that'll blow past $5K.\n\nFor context I'm running Q3CN on a Minisforum N5 Pro (Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 370, 96GB DDR5, 16 RDNA 3.5 CUs) and hitting 18 tok/s on the iGPU via Vulkan at about 95 GB/s bandwidth. No discrete GPU. Token gen is bandwidth-bound so it scales roughly linear. A Strix Halo box at 212 GB/s would be around 40 tok/s. The M4 Max at 400 GB/s would push 75+.\n\nSave the $1,500 left over for when the M4 Ultra drops. Sell the Max and upgrade to 256GB at 800 GB/s. That's the real next step for local inference in a tight little box.",

Extrapolate meaningful entries in the file, and create a dashboard using NextJS that displays that data in a meaningful format\".\n\nI did try to find something along these lines, but the vast majority of the results have just been slop, comparing features of the tooling without actually going into a deep dive on how the tooling performs for concrete, measurable instructions, or just displaying the \n\nSomething like this could allow us to actually have a tooling comparison instead of a model comparison per se. \n\nMy gut is telling me that this analysis will have a surprising conclusion, with clear winners on what model compared with what tool provides the best results. i.e GLM4.7-flash works best when paired with Claude Code and worst when paired with Cline based on <metric that was used to evaluate all model/tooling combos>. Or, gpt-oss works best when paired with OpenCode and worst with Qwen Coder.\n\n  \nI'm open to doing the research myself, but was wondering if anyone before bothered doing something like this before I spend the time. \n\n  \nThank you",

It would deprecate quickly due to the pace of change the big 3 are shipping new models. By the time you finish your first rigorous benchmark openAI, Google, and Anthropic will probably have a new model ready to be launched. \n\nI would add a caveat, I think you’re burying the lead a little bit or maybe you haven’t considered it - the memory costs of AI and AI token generation of enterprise and consumers is going to likely 100x in 2026 compared to just last year. That’s a real problem and finding efficiency gains like this might matter more than you think. Right it’s not just humans increasing the cost of AI now it’s Agents who can out produce humans in terms of pure token generation with workflows. It could honestly be 1000x in the aggregate. The real question becomes how do we train the Agents to operate in the “efficient frontier” of 2026 and in the future. And it seems like the big 3 are aware that’s what needs to happen it’s just that they CANT STOP SCALING even if it’s looking flat now.",

Harness and Scaffold don't have large impact on the model - But depending on the infrastructure they can make models perform only worse, never better.\n\n3. Many of these scaffolds have got terrible prompts (T - E - R - R - I - B - L - E). E.g look at the discussion in Opencode about the codex prompt - and their new codex prompt when OpenAI entered the game. To many contradictionary hints, restriction, example and so on. And far to long.\n\n4. Either prompts or tools will degrade performance.\n\nIf that is more or less o.k. you could switch scaffold without notice. I am using multiple of them mostly Zed, Opencode and Codex ( sometimes Antigravity ). I manage the access to the models using CLIProxy - so every harness gets the same provider chain. I feel no difference .",

Best at \"think → plan → code → test → fix\" loops on unfamiliar stacks. SWE-bench leader.\n- **OpenCode + GLM-4.7**: Closest open-source contender. 73% SWE-bench (vs Claude's 72%) + zero lock-in. Great for multi-model routing.\n- **Cline**: Solid but tool-heavy—shines on file ops, weaker on pure generation. Agent scaffolding overhead kills simple prompts.\n- **Qwen Coder**: Fastest raw speed, surprisingly good UI/dashboard code, but needs tight scaffolding for full autonomy.\n\n**Surprise winner**: OpenCode+GLM-4.7 often beats Claude Code on price/performance for production pipelines. The tooling matters more than raw model for agentic flows.\n\n**Your test methodology is perfect**—same prompt/model across tools reveals the orchestration gap. I'd run:\n1. Flappy Bird (game logic + Canvas)\n2. CSV→Recharts dashboard (data parsing + React)\n3. GitHub issue reproduction (multi-file edit)\n\nTrack: **task completion rate, edit iterations, token usage, wall-clock time**. \n\nDo it—community needs this data desperately. My bet: Claude Code edges out, but OpenCode closes gap 80%.",

          "text": "this is a really interesting question and I've been wondering the same thing about agentic tooling benchmarks. The reality is most comparisons are just feature checklists without actually measuring output quality or success rates on real tasks. If you're going to do this research yourself, here's how I'd approach it: 1.\n\n\nPick 3-5 concrete tasks with different complexity levels (the flappy bird clone is good for basic generation, the CSV dashboard is good for multi-file coordination, maybe add something like refactoring a legacy codebase or fixing a subtle bug across multiple repos) 2. Define your success metrics upfront. Not just does it run but things like: lines of code changed, build errors introduced, how many iterations needed, time to completion, whether it actually solves the stated problem vs going off track 3.\n\n\nFor the validation step, you might want to look at something like Zencoder Zenflow since it has spec-driven workflows with built-in verification loops that can measure drift between requirements and implementation. That could give you actual quantifiable data on how far each tool/model combo strays from the original prompt 4. Document everything in a spreadsheet with timestamps and iteration counts.\n\n\nScreenshots help too for when things go sideways 5. Run each combo at least 3 times since LLMs can be inconsistent The hardest part is gonna be keeping variables controlled. Same prompt wording, same model temp settings, same time of day even (API performance varies).\n\n\nBut yeah if you do this please share the results because the community desperately needs this kinda analysis instead of just vibes-based recommendations.",

      "text": "I didn't want to buy two systems. That was the whole thing.\n\nI needed a NAS. I also wanted to mess around with local LLMs. And I really didn't want to explain to my wife why I needed a second box just to talk to a chatbot that sometimes hallucinates, I have my father-in-law for that. So when I was specing out my NAS build, I went a little heavier than most people would and crossed my fingers that the system could pull double duty down the road.\n\nHonestly? I was prepared to be wrong. Worst case I'd have an overpowered NAS that never breaks a sweat. I could live with that.\n\nBut it actually worked. And way better than I expected.\n\n**The Build**\n\n* Minisforum N5 Pro\n* AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 370 (12c/24t, 16 RDNA 3.5 CUs)\n* 96GB DDR5-5600 (2x 48GB SO-DIMMs)\n* 5x 26TB Seagate Exos in RAIDZ2 (\\~70TB usable)\n* 2x 1.92TB Samsung PM983 NVMe (ZFS metadata mirror)\n* TrueNAS SCALE\n\nDay to day it runs Jellyfin with VAAPI hardware transcoding, Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, qBittorrent, FlareSolverr, Tailscale, and Dockge. It was already earning its keep before I ever touched LLM inference.\n\n**The Experiment**\n\nThe model is Qwen3-Coder-Next, 80 billion parameters, Mixture of Experts architecture with 3B active per token. I'm running the Q4\\_K\\_M quantization through llama.cpp with the Vulkan backend. Here's how it actually went:\n\n**3 tok/s** \\- First successful run. Vanilla llama.cpp and Qwen3-Coder-Next Q8 quantization, CPU-only inference. Technically working. Almost physically painful to watch. But it proved the model could run.\n\n**5 tok/s** \\- Moved to Q4\\_K\\_M quantization and started tuning. Okay. Nearly double the speed and still slow as hell...but maybe usable for an overnight code review job. Started to think maybe this hardware just won't cut it.\n\n**10 tok/s** \\- Ran across a note in a subreddit that someone got Vulkan offloading and doing 11 tok/s on similar hardware but when I tried it...I couldn't load the full model into VRAM despite having plenty of RAM. Interesting. I tried partial offload, 30 out of 49 layers to the iGPU. It worked. Now it actually felt usable but it didn't make sense that I had all this RAM and it wouldn't load all of the expert layers.\n\n**15 tok/s** \\- Then the dumb breakthrough. I discovered that `--no-mmap` was quietly destroying everything. On UMA architecture, where the CPU and GPU share the same physical RAM, that flag forces the model to be allocated twice into the same space. Once for the CPU, once for GPU-mapped memory, both pulling from the same DDR5 pool. I couldn't even load all 49 layers without OOM errors with that flag set. Dropped it. All 49 layers loaded cleanly. 46GB Vulkan buffer. No discrete GPU.\n\n**18 tok/s** \\- Still I wanted more. I enabled flash attention. An extra 3 tok/s, cut KV cache memory in half, and significantly boosted the context window.\n\n3 → 5 → 10 → 15 → 18. Each step was one discovery away from quitting. Glad I didn't.\n\n**Results (Flash Attention Enabled)**\n\n* Up to 18 tok/s text generation\n* 53.8 tok/s prompt processing\n* 50% less KV cache memory\n* Fully coherent output at any context length\n* All while Jellyfin was streaming to the living room for the kids\n\nCouldn't I just have bought a box purpose built for this? Yep. For reference, a Mac Mini M4 Pro with 64GB runs $2,299 and gets roughly 20-25 tok/s on the same model. Apple's soldered LPDDR5x gives it a real bandwidth advantage. But then it wouldn't run my media stack, store 70TB of data in RAIDZ2. I'm not trying to dunk on the Mac at all. Just saying I didn't have to buy one AND a NAS.\n\nWhich was the whole point.\n\nNo exotic kernel flags. No custom drivers. No ritual sacrifices. Vulkan just works on RDNA 3.5 under TrueNAS.\n\n**Still On the Table**\n\nI've barely scratched the surface on optimization, which is either exciting or dangerous depending on your relationship with optimizing. Speculative decoding could 2-3x effective speed. EXPO memory profiles might not even be enabled, meaning I could be leaving free bandwidth sitting at JEDEC defaults. Thread tuning, KV cache quantization, newer Vulkan backends with RDNA 3.5 optimizations landing regularly, UMA buffer experimentation, different quant formats.\n\nOn top of all that, the model wasn't even designed to run on standard transformer attention. It was built for DeltaNet, a linear attention mechanism that scales way better at long context. There's an active PR implementing it and we've been helping test and debug it. The fused kernel already hits 16 tok/s on a single CPU thread with perfect output, but there's a threading bug that breaks it at multiple cores. When that gets fixed and it can use all 12 cores plus Vulkan offloading, the headroom is significant. Especially for longer conversations where standard attention starts to choke.\n\n18 tok/s is where I am but I'm hopeful it's not where this tops out.\n\n**The Takeaway**\n\nI'm not saying everyone should overbuild their NAS for an LLM machine or that this was even a good idea. But if you're like me, enjoy tinkering and learning, and are already shopping for a NAS and you're curious about local LLMs, it might be worth considering specing a little higher if you can afford it and giving yourself the option. I didn't know if this would work when I bought the hardware, a lot of people said it wasn't worth the effort. I just didn't want to buy two systems if I didn't have to.\n\nTurns out I didn't have to. If you enjoyed the journey with me, leave a comment. If you think I'm an idiot, leave a comment. If you've already figured out what I'm doing wrong to get more tokens, definitely leave a comment.",

The problem is that i got spoiled by paid coding agents and i would like to set up one of my own. \n\nMany IDE's support local coding agents but they kinda require you to authenticate anyway and have some subscription.\n\nWhat i need is a fully offline coding agent that will be able to read the repo, create files, modify files etc.\n\nI have tried Continue plugin but it kinda sucked. Aider was \"okish\", the plugin was pretty horrible, CLI is more or less ok, but thats not exactly what i am looking for. I have also tried to integrate tools like mcpo with ripgrep and server-filesystem but thats also does not work very well.\n\nSo, i wanted to ask what works for you guys in a fully offline env?",

Ideally it should also have web searching capabilities and it should store the context long term, but I don't know if that is possible. I have experimented with mlx and it seems that mlx supports only dense models, but again I am not sure. What would be the best current LLM for my setup and use case.

      "text": "It's not the \"free personal AI assistant\" the hype suggests. You need multiple paid subscriptions before it does anything useful.\n\nI got excited about Moltbot (OpenClaw) after seeing it promoted as this amazing personal AI assistant you can run locally. \"Your own AI, your data, your servers!\" Sounds great, right?\n\nThen I actually tried to set it up. Here's what you **actually need** to make it semi-functional:\n\n# 1. AI Model Subscription 💰\n\nThe bot itself is just a shell. You need your own:\n\n* Anthropic API key (Claude)\n* OpenAI API key (GPT)\n* Google AI API key (Gemini)\n\nNone of these are free for real usage.\n\n# 2. Web Search API 💰\n\nWant your bot to search the web? You need a **Brave Search API** subscription. Google Custom Search API is another option, also paid.\n\n# 3. Browser Automation 💰\n\nThe browser control feature requires Playwright setup, and if you want it to work reliably, you're looking at potential cloud hosting costs.\n\n# 4. Voice/TTS Features 💰\n\nWant it to talk back? You need an **ElevenLabs API** subscription or OpenAI TTS credits.\n\n# The Reality\n\nBy the time you've subscribed to all these services, you're spending $50-100+/month for something that... does what exactly? Sends messages between Discord and an AI?\n\n# My Recommendation\n\nJust stick with what works:\n\n* **Coding:** GitHub Copilot in VS Code ($10/mo) or Cursor\n* **AI Research:** ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) or Gemini Advanced ($20/mo)\n* **Image Creation:** Midjourney or DALL-E directly\n* **Automation:** n8n or [Make.com](http://Make.com) with proper integrations\n\nThese tools are polished, well-documented, and just work.\n\nMoltbot feels like a cool hobby project for developers who want to tinker, but the \"personal AI assistant\" marketing is misleading. You're essentially paying for 5+ services to build something worse than what already exists.",

          "text": "Honestly, I think you've missed out on all of the real sources of hype.\n\n1. We're in 'local' LLM, solving for cost-to-quality-and-quantity is basically the mission of this community. Running a low cost local model is free, especially if you use the zero marginal cost for the routine calls and big frontier models for development, reasoning, or high value communication. Also, the recommendation in the documentation is Claude Max at $100/month so that is realistically the benchmark for all-cloud use.\n\n2 and 3. You do not need Brave search API or playwright they are just one of the options. \n\n4. Mine implemented a free edge tts on its own within like 3-4 prompts. There are many other free TTS you can run locally and I probably will implement something real later. It is functional but there are much better out there.\n\nOverall you have missed the actual 'magic', it isn't the 'assistant' that makes OpenClaw feel new, it is ripping out the guardrails and watching it solve problems autonomously. The 'heartbeat' pattern which forms a cron/while loop in which the LLM essentially routinely strategizes to solve its own problems and takes initiative to solve things feels very different. I think we all could have imagined it, but now can sort of see in action. Agentic solutions through autonomous strategizing, long sequences of reasoning-act loops, followed by layers of verification and continuous improvement on itself. \n\nAnyways, I'd totally flip the conclusion to be honest. Coding should be a frontier model through CLI, in which OpenClaw can actually manifest this but I'd stick with either OpenCode or Claude Code. Definitely never a within IDE code assistant again after going to CLI systems, I don't need that ball and chain.",
