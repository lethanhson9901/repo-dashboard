Frontier LLMs went insane on reasoning, open‑source finally became “good enough” for a ton of real workloads, OCR and VLMs leveled up, and audio models quietly made agents actually usable in the real world. ​ Here’s a category‑wise recap of the “best of 2025” models that actually changed how people build stuff, not just leaderboard screenshots:\n\n\n\nLLMs and reasoning\n\n\\* GPT‑5.2 (Thinking / Pro) – Frontier‑tier reasoning and coding, very fast inference, strong for long‑horizon tool‑using agents and complex workflows.\n\n​\\* Gemini 3 Pro / Deep Think – Multi‑million token context and multimodal “screen reasoning”; excels at planning, code, and web‑scale RAG / NotebookLM‑style use cases. \n\n\\* Claude 4.5 (Sonnet / Opus) – Extremely strong for agentic tool use, structured step‑by‑step plans, and “use the computer for me” style tasks. \n\n\\* DeepSeek‑V3.2 & Qwen3‑Thinking – Open‑weight monsters that narrowed the gap with closed models to within \\\\\\~0.3 points on key benchmarks while being orders of magnitude cheaper to run.\n\nIf 2023–24 was “just use GPT,” 2025 finally became “pick an LLM like you pick a database.”\n\nVision, VLMs & OCR\n\n\\* MiniCPM‑V 4.5 – One of the strongest open multimodal models for OCR, charts, documents, and even video frames, tuned to run on mobile/edge while still hitting SOTA‑ish scores on OCRBench/OmniDocBench. \n\n\\* olmOCR‑2‑7B‑1025 – Allen Institute’s OCR‑optimized VLM, fine‑tuned from Qwen2.5‑VL, designed specifically for documents and long‑form OCR pipelines. \n\n\\* InternVL 2.x / 2.5‑4B – Open VLM family that became a go‑to alternative to closed GPT‑4V‑style models for document understanding, scene text, and multimodal reasoning.\n\n\\* Gemma 3 VLM & Qwen 2.5/3 VL lines – Strong open(-ish) options for high‑res visual reasoning, multilingual OCR, and long‑form video understanding in production‑style systems. ​ \n\n2025 might be remembered as the year “PDF to clean Markdown with layout, tables, and charts” stopped feeling like magic and became a boring API call.\n\nAudio, speech & agents\n\n\\* Whisper (still king, but heavily optimized) – Remained the default baseline for multilingual ASR in 2025, with tons of optimized forks and on‑device deployments. \n\n\\* Low‑latency real‑time TTS/ASR stacks (e.g., new streaming TTS models & APIs) – Sub‑second latency + streaming text/audio turned LLMs into actual real‑time voice agents instead of “podcast narrators.” \n\n\\* Many 2025 voice stacks shipped as APIs rather than single models: ASR + LLM + real‑time TTS glued together for call centers, copilots, and vibecoding IDEs. ​ Voice went from “cool demo” to “I talk to my infra/IDE/CRM like a human, and it answers back, live.”\n\nOCR/document AI & IDP\n\n\\* olmOCR‑2‑7B‑1025, MiniCPM‑V 4.5, InternVL 2.x, OCRFlux‑3B, PaddleOCR‑VL – A whole stack of open models that can parse PDFs into structured Markdown with tables, formulas, charts, and long multi‑page layouts. \n\n\\* On top of these, IDP / “PDF AI” tools wrapped them into full products for invoices, contracts, and messy enterprise docs. ​ \n\nIf your 2022 stack was “Tesseract + regex,” 2025 was “drop a 100‑page scan and get usable JSON/Markdown back.” ​ \n\nOpen‑source LLMs that actually mattered\n\n\\* DeepSeek‑V3.x – Aggressive MoE + thinking budgets + brutally low cost; a lot of people quietly moved internal workloads here. \n\n\\* Qwen3 family – Strong open‑weight reasoning, multilingual support, and specialized “Thinking” variants that became default self‑host picks. \n\n\\* Llama 4 & friends – Closed the gap to within \\\\\\~0.3 points of frontier models on several leaderboards, making “fully open infra” a realistic choice for many orgs.\n\n​In 2025, open‑source didn’t fully catch the frontier, but for a lot of teams, it crossed the “good enough + cheap enough” threshold.\n\nYour turn This list is obviously biased toward models that:\n\n\\* Changed how people build products (agents, RAG, document workflows, voice UIs)\n\n\\* Have public benchmarks, APIs, or open weights that normal devs can actually touch ​- What did you ship or adopt in 2025 that deserves “model of the year” status?\n\nFavorite frontier LLM?\n\n\\* Favorite open‑source model you actually self‑hosted?\n\n\\* Best OCR / VLM / speech model that saved you from pain?\n\n\\* Drop your picks below so everyone can benchmark / vibe‑test them going into 2026.",

K2 Thinking works best high RAM rigs or with high GPU count, like twenty MI50 cards (for 640 GB VRAM in total) - I actually considered getting that much since at the time I looked into it, it was possible for half the price of RTX PRO 6000 and my motherboard could carry them all at PCI-E 4.0 x4 speed each, but I decided to stay with 4x3090 for now (because even though full VRAM inference would be faster, my current performance with 1 TB RAM + 96 GB VRAM is still acceptable to me, and a lot of what I do requires Nvidia cards, and not just LLMs either).",

You’ll be able to see exactly how the cooling system is built and why these design choices were made.\n\nWe believe it’s better to be transparent about trade-offs and deliver a product that performs consistently, rather than chasing form factors at the expense of real-world usability.",

If the ebooks are like current info that can change or become stale you will want to tag them and set up some sort of workflow to compare them to a Gemini or open ai call to compare the info and if it becomes stale remove it. I use qdrant and postgresql for ground truth. I do stuff like this for versions of python that I have to use to stay compatible with other things I'm running. Or actually for langchain and langgraph too. They just changed compatibility versions so whenever I upgrade I can just use the newer repo in my rag with the updated information. I will still keep the old one until I am absolutely certain I won't revert but you can just leave it sit there and not reference the old one. Hope that makes sense.",

I've written a script to run a benchmark test and measure speed with all combinations of different context length / % GPU-offload layer / force experts on CPU on vs off.\n\nWith smaller context (i.e. 10k tokens) I get up to 16 TPS. This drops to around 10 @200k tokens. I'm no expert but I don't think there will be a big difference between 5070 or 5080 if VRAM is the same.\n\nWhat i can't understand is that with nemotron it does not matter how much layers I offload to GPU. The model is around 30 GB but only between 4 and 6 GB VRAM is used regardless of offload setting. It seems only the active layers are offloaded to GPU. This was different when I qwen 2.5, where I had to balance the exact number of layers that would fit in VRAM. As soon as you try to offload more layers than fit in VRAM, regular RAM will be used as shared VRAM and TPS drop drastically. \n\nProbably nothing new here for most redditors on this sub but i'm new to local LLM's and had to figure out a lot of things myself.",

      "text": "Hi mates,\n\nI mostly use ChatGPT and Mistral (through their \"vibe coding\" cli tool and API). I don't pay for these services, so I only use the lesser-capable models.\n\nMy laptop is not powerful enough to run this (no GPU / I've experimented with ollama but I can only run the smallest models very slowly so this is not ok for daily use), so I'm currently considering building a device dedicated to running a LLM, mainly for coding purposes. Ideally something small, Raspberry Pi-based or similar would be great.\n\nI have a few questions: is there specialized hardware for this (I've heard of TPU/NPU)? What kind of performance can I expect (I'd need at least GPT4/Devstral level)? I'm also worried about speed (tokens/s) and cost.\n\n  \nAny advice is appreciated!\n\nCheers!",

That'll let you run 30B-ish models at 15--30 toks/s.\n\nWhy 30B? 20--30B is the size range where the model is still (sort of) considered \"small\" yet it starts being actually useful.\n\nThat said, you should consider using Openrouter and spend $5 for credits to test said models and see if they're good enough for you. You wouldn't want to buy a ~$1000 GPU just to get annoyed that your model's too braindead, right?\n\nRegarding TPU/NPU, I haven't heard if NPUs finally have the necessary software infrastructure to be useful. Well, they wouldn't really help LLMs if there's no development in memory bandwidth to go with them.\n\nOn the other hand, Google sells Coral TPUs, but those are for computer vision, not LLMs, and anyway, they only have *megabytes* of memory.",

      "text": "I am uneducated in this area but want to learn more. I have been considering getting a rig to mess around with Local LLM more and am looking at GPUs to buy. It would seem that AMD GPUs are priced better than NVIDIA GPUs (and I was even considering some Chinese GPUs). \n\nAs I am reading around, it sounds like NVIDIA has the advantage of CUDA, but I'm not quite sure what this really is and why it is an advantage. For example, can't AMD simply make their chips compatible with CUDA? Or can't they make it so that their chips are also efficient running PyTorch?\n\n\n\nAgain, I'm pretty much a novice in this space, so some of the words I am using I don't even really know what they are and how they relate to others. Is there an ELI5 on this? Like...the RTX 3090 is a GPU (hardware chip). Is CUDA like the firmware that allows the OS to use the GPU to do calculations? And is it that most LLM tools written with CUDA API calls in mind but not AMD's equivalent firmware API calls? Is that what makes it such that AMD is less efficient or poorly supported with LLM applications?\n\n\n\nSorry if the question doesn't make much sense... ",

It’s an “OpenAPI-compatible” endpoint, so you can use it remotely with any number of frontends that support it.\n\nBy far the most common/popular choice _(and what I use personally)_ is [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) which has a ChatGPT-esque look to it. It’s a lightweight webserver that you can run easily as a docker container.\n\nOnce set up, you can configure Open WebUI to connect to any remote API, such as Anthropic or ChatGPT. In this case you’d point it at your locally hosted LM Studio API.\n\nSince it’s web based, you can use it directly on your phone via web browser, so long as you’re on the same network as your PC.\n\n_Additionally, you could try out [Conduit](https://github.com/cogwheel0/conduit), which is a native mobile app for accessing Open WebUI, and is available on the App Store/Play Store. You’d still need to set up Open WebUI, but IMO the Conduit interface is a bit nicer on my phone than trying to use Open WebUI in a mobile browser. This is very optional though, you can just use it in a browser._",

I've given it a few more tests and it has given me an enthusiastic thumbs up to some really horrible questions and even made some suggestions I hadn't even considered.

Sharing an open-source project that might be useful:\n\nLynkr connects AI coding tools (like Claude Code) to multiple LLM providers with intelligent routing.\n\n  \nKey features:\n\n\\- Route between multiple providers: Databricks, Azure Ai Foundry, OpenRouter, Ollama,llama.cpp, OpenAi\n\n\\- Cost optimization through hierarchical routing, heavy prompt caching\n\n\\- Production-ready: circuit breakers, load shedding, monitoring\n\n\\- It supports all the features offered by claude code like sub agents, skills , mcp , plugins etc unlike other proxies which only supports basic tool callings and chat completions.\n\nGreat for:\n\n\\- Reducing API costs as it supports hierarchical routing where you can route requstes to smaller local models and later switch to cloud LLMs automatically.\n\n\\- Using enterprise infrastructure (Azure)\n\n\\-  Local LLM experimentation\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n\nnpm install -g lynkr\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/Fast-Editor/Lynkr](https://github.com/Fast-Editor/Lynkr) (Apache 2.0)\n\nWould love to get your feedback on this one.

If someone has the tinkerer's spirit, I say go for it.  I think it's a lot of fun, whether it's superior or not.",

You could just grab entry-level versions of newer chips for raw processing power and potentially cluster them together.\n\nBasically: Lock in the RAM now, upgrade compute later on the cheap.\n\nAm I thinking about this right, or am I missing something obvious about how clustering/distributed inference would actually work with Apple Silicon?",

For inference they're probably the cheapest but in a sea of insanity it's always tough to say anyone's benefiting with any price on tech lol. \n\nI also think NVME drives are set to go up soon. They're also going to be impacted with the DRAM shortages since NAND Flash has parallel supply constraints.\n\nAll of it compounds. I train models so secured my rig all the way back last march since I saw this insanity coming but if I was looking at a pure inference machine and I needed it sooner and couldn't wait a year or 2 then I'd probably pick up an Apple machine.",

Unless someone with a Digitimes subscription would like to share the article with the sources...\n\nPricing for soon-to-be-released M5 Pro, Max, and Ultra will be a key indicator of how good Apple's DRAM supply contracts are, and what actually expired. The majority of the DRAM they buy is ordinary LPDDR for iPhones.\n\nIt will be interesting times, for sure. RAM is only a fraction of the BOM cost, especially for MacBook Pro and Mac Studio. They could choose to eat the difference until prices come down. Their size gives them a lot of leverage, so they will be the last to suffer, and the least.",

          "text": "Unfortunately I think the answer is “we don’t know yet”. The Exo / RDMA stuff is exciting, but it’s still not entirely clear how it will play out and what the real-world capabilities are. The Exo folks did post a teaser showing a DGX ‘clustered’ to a Mac Studio over TB implying that prompt processing on the Nvidia and inference on the Mac was better than just running the Mac, but it was short on details. At some point even TB5 bandwidth is going to be a limitation, and it’s entirely possible that the NPU improvements in the M5 series will be good enough to make the added complexity of clustering unattractive.\n\nThere also was a post a couple months back about someone getting an AMD gpu working (for compute, not graphics output) in a TB PCIE dock on an Apple Silicon Mac, but this was just a POC and I don’t believe it was to the point of actually being able to run LLM models on it. Personally I think this is more intriguing as it seems more likely to gain adoption in the ‘budget crowd’  - dropping a 7900XTX into a dock is less daunting than managing multiple machines. But once again - whether this is actually something that willl work ‘in production’ remains to be seen.\n\nI’m struggling with the same questions. I have a 64GB M1 Max, and really want to move to at least 128GB. But an M5 Max128GB  might be $5k+ with the ram shortage. An M4 Max is too limited in PP compared to what ‘should be’ coming to make me comfortable sinking the $$ into it at the moment, although if the external GPU idea materializes that would probably change. I’m seriously eyeing a Framework Strix Halo motherboard with the idea that the X4 slot might allow hybrid GPU/Unified functionallity, but I haven’t actuallly seen any results suggesting you can divide PP/TG to really get the best of both worlds. (i.e. basically the same idea as an external GPU on a Mac, but with lower TG performance)",
