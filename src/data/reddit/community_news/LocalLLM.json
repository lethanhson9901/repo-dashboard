The documentation gap for multi-GPU is real, I've spent more time piecing together config from GitHub issues than actual docs.\n\n2. Good to hear. I'm mixing card types but pinning models deliberately so each card basically runs independently.\n\n3. That's a fast ROI, are you running inference as a service or using it for internal workloads?\n\n4. This is the point I keep coming back to. The trend toward stronger smaller models is exactly why I went with a distributed multi-card approach rather than dumping everything into one or two massive GPUs. If a 70B model can do what a 400B does today, having flexible GPU allocation matters more than raw single-card VRAM.\n\n5. Haha noted. I did a lot of benchmarking and testing before committing to the full build, but I can see how easy it would be to overbuy on hardware that doesn't match your actual workload.  I also spent around $5-6k using open AI API (Using Chat GPT 4o) via Azure in December.\n\n",

          "text": "Your build is awesome, I am doing something very similar.  Here are some improvements you may want to consider:\n\n1. Upgrade your processor to improve your memory bandwidth.  You have a Threadripper Pro CPU and Motherboard which is better than the non pro Threadripper systems for two reasons: a) more PCIe lanes and b) 8 memory channels.  Unfortunately the 9955wx CPU only has two CCDs so can't utilize all 8 memory channels - you need a CPU with more CCDs (such as the 9965wx) to make use of the 8 memory channels.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mcrx23/psa\\_the\\_new\\_threadripper\\_pros\\_9000\\_wx\\_are\\_still/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mcrx23/psa_the_new_threadripper_pros_9000_wx_are_still/)\n2. PCIe 5.0 has benefits for AI.  The 3090tis are good bang/buck but they are running over PCIe 4.0 so can't take advantage of the new PCIe 5.0 features.  The actual benefit of an all PCIe 5.0 solution depends on your use case and model but it is more than just twice the bandwidth. [https://www.graniteriverlabs.com/en-us/technical-blog/pcie-gen-5-ai-ml](https://www.graniteriverlabs.com/en-us/technical-blog/pcie-gen-5-ai-ml)\n3. The up coming Apple M5 systems may very well be the best bang/buck due to their recently released RDMA over TB5, MLX AI acceleration and its high speed unified memory architecture.  I am really looking forward to seeing how a cluster of M5 mac minis does.  Check out exo: [https://github.com/exo-explore/exo](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo)",

I only run Debian 12, one instance of ollama and only one model at a time.\n\nI spent a fair amount of time on PCIe and power tuning.  A lot of performance problems that I had was because when running a larger model that spanned multiple cards, the latency caused by traversing the PCIe bus (and sometimes Numa node) was just long enough that the cards power management would bump it from P2 to P5+, then jump back up to P2 when it actually needed to do something, which added even more latency, which caused cascading slowdown across all the cards where I'd start off really fast, then as the response typed out, it would progressively slow down to the point of just a couple tokens a second.  My setup is not PCIe x16 for every card, so that also exacerbated the issue.\n\nThe solution was multi-fold: \n1. set the power management so that the cards idle at P3 and jump to P2 for inference.  This fixed a huge amount of performance problems with larger contexts and responses.  \n2. Put the cards that actually have PCIe x16 connections on the ends of the chain and the x8 cards in the middle.  Also, order the cards (in ollama.service) so that all the cards on each numa node are together to minimize the number of cross numa jumps during inference.  \n3. Also in the bios, set the PCI max request packet size to 4096.  On my particular system, it defaulted to 128.  Turns out the 3060s won't do more than 256, but it's worth more than a couple tokens a second.\n4. Also in the BIOS, turn rebar on so the system can see and address the entire PCIe VRAM instead of addressing it in 256MB chunks, also worth a few more tokens per second.",

If you have any errors during training: timeout, gpu fell off (I forget the exact wording), weird training speeds, etc, it's most likely your cables.  You need pcie retimer/redriver card with those cable lengths.  Especially with pcie5.  Check any professional training servers, they have retimer/redriver if the gpu is not plugged into the pcie slot.  Heck, my HBA cards have a retimer to connect to my HDD/NVME.  On the other hand, inference tends to be fine with pcie cables.  Have you done any serious multi-day/week training yet? \n\n2) CPU doesn't matter as much as people think.  I use an 8 core AMD 7002 cpu, never maxed it out once during training.  Just cache everything (latents/embeds/etc) before training.  Which you should be doing anyway to save vram during training.\n\n3) PCIE speed also doesn't matter as much as people think. Going from x16 to x8 only decreases training speed a couple percent.  There isn't a large amount of data exchanged between gpus during training, assuming you wrote a good trainer.  PCIE latency is the real killer.\n\n4) RAM is awesome.  You can do so much more with more ram.  GPU offset to ram, keeping everything in ram, using ram to write temp files to, EMA can done on cpu, etc.  Having more ram makes everything easier.  I just upgraded to 1TB for dataset curation use.\n\n5) HDD space is also awesome.  I have \\~400TB, it's not enough.  Just being able keeping a copy of fully prepped, ,ready to train, cached dataset on disk with the original data is so nice.   Then you can store your embeddings, and whatever else on disk with the original data.   \n  \nRam and disk space used properly can reduce vram usage during training, and significantly speed up training, especially for multi-run training.",

I have just been analyzing massive amounts of company data to build into a combo of duckdb, neo4j and embedding graph. I will deploy a chatbot integrated into teams for the users to start using and store all of the query info so I can use that info to them finetune the models for better output.\n\nThe training aspect, is something I really have zero experience with, so I will learn about it while I am attempting to build out that pipeline, but I am still a bit away from that point.\n\nAnother commenter posted a good video about pcie retimer/Redriver cards, honestly was the first time I heard about them. I have to look into it more, from what I gathered they are pretty pricy, but at this point, if it will improve things, then I will make the investment. I have to get a better/larger open air rig, bc the one I have is too small.\n\nSo CPU I can leave as is then , I mean it's not the top of the line, but it's up there.\n\nDo you think I should get more ram? The prices of course are out of control. I initially bought 128 GB for 1600, then decided a week later I wanted 256 total, so when I went to buy another 128 gb kit the price was already up to $2k and when I check yesterday that same kit was now $3k. Nuts!\n\nI only have the 3 nvme ssds. I am storing all of the models on the 9100 and everything else on the 990 pros. I was thinking about getting some mechanical sata HDDs for long term storage and backups maybe 8-10TB.\n\nThanks again. I also do not yet know how to optimize/comfigure the HDD and the ram as per your recommendations, but I will add all of this to the seemingly endless list of things I need to figure out - hah. \n\nThanks again! \n\nBtw - I ended up adding a 3rd blackwell.

Started with 2x 3090 and slowly built up from there.  \nI have zero experience with training LLMs, but I have written my own fully custom multi-gpu text-to-image trainers.  I assume my training experience with transfer over to what you're doing, but maybe LLM training has it's own quicks.\n\nPCIe retimer/redriver:   \nWhen I first started learning programming, I lost 6 months of training time due to pcie cables.  Gpu, fell off the bus, time outs, really strange training speeds (one run would be 2-3x the speed of the next)  Asked everyone everywhere, no one had any idea what was wrong.  Re-wrote my scripts, bought the most expensive cables I could find, thought I was going crazy, and nearly gave up.  Tried a retimer card, problem solved.  I learned a lot about multi-gpu training during that time, but that's not the best way to learn.  I also burnt the retimer chip on my first card, so use fans on your retimer/redrivers.   \n  \nFor me, retimer/redriver card is non-optional for training.  I won't even consider training without one.  If an problem shows up, how do I know it's not the cables?  I bought my cards for \\~$150 each.  They do x16 or 2 x8.  Make sure you ask the seller if they support 2x 8/x16.  A lot of cards support 4 x4 by default, and the seller needs to flash the card to support 2x 8/x16. You'll also need the cables and the pcie boards.\n\nAlso, pcie cables seem fine for inference.  I never had a problem with inference when using pcie cables.\n\nRam:  \nRam prices are stupid, I know.  I just bought 1TB DDR4 2666mhz ram for $3800, I think I did OK for current market.  3200mhz would have been double the price, I don't even want to think about what ddr5 costs.  The 1tb ram is to be used for the image dataset sorting: embedding clustering and such.  \n  \nRam really benefits for fast gpus with low vram.  When I used 2x 3090 to train the sdxl unet, I had to use FSDP GRAD\\_SHARD\\_OP to get the model to fit into memory.  But there still wasn't enough vram room for a large enough batch size to saturate the gpu core.  So I used just enough ram via cpu\\_offset to saturate the core.  I lost some speed due to the cpu\\_offset, but I gained more speed via  increased batch size for core utilization.  Ram will help your 3090s more than the pro 6000.\n\nStandard training advice is ram = 2x total vram, and on my two 3090s, I was using \\~100GB ram during training.  A lot of the open source trainers focus on being conservative with vram/ram, so it won't matter as much.  But if you're writing your own code, there is just so much you can do with more ram: holding extra models, prefetch batches, ema, etc.    \n  \nFor standard consumer gpus, I highly suggest 2x total training gpu vram.  But maybe LLM training can use less?  And the pro6000s aren't vram starved. So, who knows? Regardless, 256 is enough to get started.    \n  \nFor ram (and vram): size is more important than speed.  Speed is nice, but if you don't have enough size, you're screwed.  So if you see a good deal on slightly slower speed, but a larger amount, buy it.\n\nHDDs:  \nI do blocks of 8 HDDs.  Most motherboards have 8 sata ports, HBA cards have 8/16/24, so 8 is a good number.  ZFS is the file system of choice, it's near impossible to lose your data.  I use raidz2 with a L2ARC metadata cache partition on a cheap sdd.  The ssd cache significantly speeds up the HDDs. It's fast enough for text-to-image training, don't know about LLM.  I buy used enterprise HDDs, no problems so far. Buy from a reputable seller and you're good.\n\nYou're cpu is most likely fine, unless LLM training has crazy cpu requirements.  Ram and HDDs will benefit you more.\n\nAlso, consider what you want to do with the pro6000s & 3090s.  Should they really be in the same machine?  I can't imagine they're be used together, unless you're running some huge model just for fun.  Maybe buy an old AMD 7002/7003 board and split off the 3090s?  \n  \nI will use my pro6000s for training with a 4090 48GB for support (validation/ema/etc) and inference. All the other gpus will be used for dataset curation.  So I'm considering moving 2x 4090 48GB and 2x 3090 to the data server, and leaving the 2x pro6000 and a 4090 48GB in the training server.",

Speeds go up if you use a smaller quantization but there's no need to sacrifice quality.\n\nI've been messing about with Step-3.5-Flash and MiniMax-M2.5 though, which are 196B and 229B respectively.  Both fit okay with an IQ3 based quantization, but Step seems to suffer a fair bit at that level, while MiniMax however seems to be just fine, or at least, it's hasn't really put a foot wrong in the coding tasks I've asked of it.\n\nBasically I'm refining an IQ3 quant of MiniMax, as well as tuning the VM parameters of the kernel, to get it running as smooth as possible.  It seems to be ticking along at 30tg/sec as of this morning, and it generally emits better quality output that works the first or second time, whereas Qwen Coder Next makes a lot of small mistakes that I really need to keep an eye on.\n\nI also found out today how to fix a chat template bug that was in the original release of MiniMax, and I now have it working really well (again, as if today).",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I've been building this for a while and finally shipped it.\n\n**VELLE.AI** is a local AI operating system that runs on top of Ollama. It's not just another chat wrapper. It's a full personal assistant with persistent memory, two-way voice, a quantitative finance engine, and a productivity suite with todos, habits, goals, journal, and achievements.\n\n**What makes it different:**\n\n* **Persistent memory** — it actually remembers you across sessions. Your preferences, your name, your projects. All stored locally in SQLite.\n* **Two-way voice** — speech-to-text plus text-to-speech with hands-free mode. Talk to it, it talks back.\n* **7 personalities** — switch between Default, Sarcastic, Evil Genius, Anime Mentor, Sleepy, Kabuneko (finance gremlin), and Netrunner (cyberpunk). They actually stay in character.\n* **Kabuneko Quant Engine** — real-time stock quotes, full technical analysis including RSI, MACD, Bollinger, ADX, Sharpe, momentum scanning, value dislocations, backtesting, sentiment analysis, and a 4-bucket stock ideas generator. All from Yahoo Finance, no API keys needed.\n* **Productivity suite** — task manager with priorities, projects, due dates, habit tracker with streaks and weekly grids, pomodoro timer, goal system with milestones and progress bars, personal journal with writing prompts, bookmarks, knowledge base.\n* **25 achievements** — unlock badges as you use it. Toast notifications slide in when you earn one.\n* **Auto-insights** — detects patterns like \"work has been a recurring stressor 4 times this week\" or \"you created 15 tasks but only completed 3.\"\n* **Daily briefing** — one command gives you mood, tasks, habits, goals, streaks, reminders, and market data.\n* **Local file search** — searches your Desktop, Documents, Projects, Code directories by filename and content.\n* **System commands** — opens apps, runs PowerShell commands, controls your machine.\n* **Proactive reminders** — \"remind me to check email in 10 minutes\" actually fires with browser notifications plus text-to-speech.\n* **Cyberpunk terminal UI** — because aesthetics matter.\n\n**Tech stack:** Node.js, Express, WebSocket, SQLite, Ollama, vanilla JS. About 8,000 lines across 6 server modules. Works with any Ollama model including qwen3:8b, llama3, mistral. Ships as a Windows .exe or run from source on any OS.\n\n**Zero external AI APIs. Zero telemetry. Zero cloud. Everything local.**\n\n",

Would let me run absolutely massive models locally without VRAM constraints. But the performance isn’t optimized for ML model training as to CUDA, and the raw compute is weaker. Like basic models would tale days\n\nOption 2: NVIDIA GPU setup – Way better performance and optimization (CUDA ecosystem is unmatched), but I’m bottlenecked by VRAM. Even a 5090 only has 32GB,.\n\nIdeally I want the memory capacity of Mac + the raw power of NVIDIA, but that doesn’t exist in one box.\n\nHas anyone found a good solution? Hybrid setup? ",

It should be coming later this year and will be far better for all AI workloads than the previous gen Macs due to the built in matmul acceleration in the M5 GPU.

In times of Claude Code it's incredibly easy to invest a little time to solve the whole task selfmade.\n\nMy question is: how can you decide against a subscription model and still want money for it while claiming to be open source? No offense, just a serious question.\n\nAs an additional use case idea: I work with deaf people and having a Mac on a table that makes a whole conversation transparent for anyone at that table would be a great feature, requiring just a text output window scalable to fullsize screen, while letting users choose font/fontsizes and opting out the requirement to push a button. It just can be active all the time and can be started/stopped by a keypress.",

      "text": "For all TLDR:\n\n Qwen3 8b-vl is the best in its weight class for recognizing formatted text (even better than Mistral 14b with OCR).\n\nFor others:\n\nHi everyone, this is my first post. I wanted to discuss my observations regarding LLMs with OCR capabilities.\n\nWhile developing a utility for automating data processing from documents, I needed to extract text from specific areas of documents. Initially, I thought about using OCR, like Tesseract, but I ran into the issue of having no control over the output. Essentially, I couldn't recognize the text and make corrections (for example, for surnames) in a single request.\n\nI decided to try Qwen3 8b-vl. It turned out to be very simple. The ability to add data to the system prompt for cross-referencing with the recognized text and making corrections on the fly proved to be an enormous killer feature. You can literally give it all the necessary data, the data format, and the required output format for its response. And you get a response in, say, a JSON format, which you can then easily convert into a dictionary (if we're talking about Python).\n\nI tried Mistral 14b, but I found that its text recognition on images is just terrible with the same settings and system prompt (compared to Qwen3 8b-vl). Smaller models are simply unusable. Since I'm sending single requests without saving context, I can load the entire model with a 4k token context and get a stable, fast response processed on my GPU.\n\nIf people who work on extracting text from documents using LLMs (visual text extraction) read this, I'd be happy to hear about your experiences.\n\nFor reference, my specs:\nR7 5800X\nRTX 3070 8GB\n32GB DDR4\n\nUPD: Forgot to mention. I work with Cyrillic text recognition, so everyone from the CIS segment reading this post can be sure that it applies to Cyrillic alphabets as well.",

This is the Real World Coworker we've been waiting for: something that costs $1 for an hour of intensive work. If you read their RL technical blog, it's clear they're prioritizing tool-use and search (76.3% on BrowseComp) over just being a \"chatty\" bot.

Instead you would say vllm with this batch setting increases pp accelerating data ingestion or something. Maybe discussing mcp management tools options and workflow management from a specifications angle would address this OP's questions. A proprietary technology is not what is being discussed here rather it's more fundamental software tools and methods being discussed and how to approach common regulations. That doesn't require sharing private information it just helps reduce the amount of work the people coming behind you have to do to get the same right publicly available answers. \n\nI think the bigger issue in tech is tech snobs who want to prevent people who they think are lesser from engaging in deeper tech topics. As a career convert who came from another science field to comp sci I've noticed there is a split between the open source folks and the folks who think if you're not in research or working on some ground breaking thing then your trash. \n\nTo be clear I think you mostly expressed genuine curiosity so I'm not bashing you but I get annoyed by people who constantly criticize without offering insight. People are here to learn, teach, or be jerks. Too many of the latter linger around. There is no lock on information these days. The hard part is there is a lot of disinformation too. So if you know better then tell people how to do better.\n\nIf you see someone say something problematic correct it and then the butterfly effect happens. There's propagation all sorts of ways so when people who know better spend the time to hold their nose up but not offer insight then the less informed people get to spread misinformation unchecked multiplying the negative because people who know better choose unproductive criticism.",

I am an attorney and while I don't have to deal with HIPAA and getting BAAs, my obligations for client confidentiality are similar to yours.\n\nI have been benchmarking and writing about my experience here and in r/ollama but I haven't shared the graphic above.\n\nData extraction is easy, many simple models can do it. However, the commercial models hosted on the commercial clouds are just so heavily optimized for the tasks. All five of the models above succeeded, though when it came to quality, Gemini Flash (not Flash Lite) produced the best results at a slightly higher cost than is in that chart. And it can handle 51,000 documents in about ½ hour for under $10.\n\nTool calling is a different story. I have not benchmarked this and compared the various options in detail, but I can tell you that it requires a lot more effort and a larger context size. On one test run, I did, a document extraction and summarization task with gpt-oss-20b took 20s but a tool call task and summarization took a little over 6 min. I have not tested it with Gemini 2.5 Flash which says it supports function calling and code execution. That may be different than what I want, which is using an MCP server. ",

Add it in after the 5060TIs (486GB/s vs 306GB/s) to push an increase on your performance.\n\nI understand the use case for wanting the smartest model and the buyer's remorse (although honestly you really didn't lose anything considering all your parts appreciated and you can just easily sell the important parts for atleast cost) but research on inference should've been the priority. For consumer rigs, you will most likely never be running full precision of these big MoEs, and understanding that becomes important. You need to atleast have a layman's understanding of how to look for effective quant types for your system and how to run it.\n\nHere's my recommendation for you to try\n\n\\-Compile llama.cpp for CUDA. This is a must (if you don't want to compile, find a compiled binary and just use that. Make sure it supports Minimax 2.5)\n\n\\- -fit param should work, but my guess is that it's prioritizing your CUDA0 (the 2060) and that has to go. You need to make sure the 5060tis are top priority then the 2060 then your CPU RAM. Because Minimax is requiring essentially most of your RAM, I wouldn't even bother with three GPUs, as the benefit is marginal.\n\nAdd these params:   \n\\-ctk q8\\_0 (quantizes the cache)  \n  \n \\-b 1024 -ub 1024 (increases batch size, for CPU heavy moe inference, this should provide a boost in your prompt processing speed)   \n  \n\\-ot exps=CPU (this will offload all the exps onto your CPU, leaving the attention and shared exps open)   \n  \n\\-ngl 99 (whatever the layer count is, only max it out if you have ran -ot exps=CPU.)  \n  \n \\-ot attn=CUDA0 (if you dont want to run -ot exps=CPU or experimenting, run this param instead.

You failed to mention a database, chunking, RAG, embedders, reranking, an agentic layer/loop, prompt engineering, a chat API, audio models, etc. Are we to assume you threw a bunch of hardware at what is, at bottom, a software engineering problem?\n\nYou can create [seriously useful systems](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1r26mw9/getting_ready_to_send_this_monster_to_the/) with far less hardware power than you have there. You'd simply need to realize the roles and limitations of various HW/SW components and engineer accordingly.\n\nI'll totally admit it's a lot of work, however. I'm currently going nuts building mine. Then again, I care very little about having a chat bot which can reorder my laundery detergent. And I care enormously about having an agent that can, in less than a minute: iteratively search, download and synthesize 100 web pages, all while simultaneously doing multi-hop hybrid RAG search, reranking and retrieval from hundreds of books and academic papers. Future versions will have things like geospatial intelligence, personal planning, and a graph database with entity extraction/resolution loops.\n\nThis disparity of purpose is probably why we don't have nice convergent software projects that just do it all for us. At present, it seems like you've got to build the (software) system you want. But maybe if you figure out what you want out of your system, you'll be able to find an agentic FOSS software project that can simply do what you want?\n\nYou'd certainly need to drop to a smaller model like the 30b a3b model in the post I linked or, for deep research and synthesis projects like mine, maybe a dense 32b qwen3 model plus wicked good ancillary models suited to your needs (embedder, reranker, tts and stt/whisper, book extraction neural nets like `marker`, etc). But don't write off these smaller LLMs. They are ridiculously good if placed at the helm of a really solid agentic framework. Mine is getting SCARY GOOD at its core tasks. SCARY. GOOD.",

My bandwidth is 2x yours, and you have 8x more of it. It means that it's (ghetto math) up to 16x slower than my system, and my system is unusably slow. your VRAM is what saves you, but the moment you spill out, you're doomed. And with that much RAM, the only logical thing to do is in fact to spill out. So there may be tricks to play with a strictly enforced MoE model, and leaning hard on speculative decoding. Did you try that, or have you given up? Idk how often an MoE would rotate active parameters, and you wouldnt go far housing 2 models + context in that VRAM, but if you're hell bent on making it work... If you're unfamiliar w speculative decoding, ask gemini for eg, provide your VRAM + RAM specs, and ask which MoE + speculative decoding model combo you could run to maximize the intersection of intelligence + not spilling out of VRAM. Do say Feb 26 in your prompt, because models drop every day. ",

Both do not involve an LLM; though I tried. \n\nBut, using an LLM to generate ‘complicated’ scripts. A lot of trading maths … probably simple for a data scientist. \n\nPrerequisites. Coinbase api and account with key with access to create orders. Python. \n\nMethod 1. \nGainers. Obvious to spot with human eyes - after the fact. Script to identify gainers early. Using multiple data points. \nI can into those if you are serious.  \nGainers are the 3,4,5+ X plays. \n\nUSELESS-USD\n\nMethod 2. \nRegular buy low sell high. Buying low before the season starts. Like NOW. \nHistorical data shows how high. It’s usually very close for the alts I pick. \n\nSOL: 2-3x. \nTOSHI: 5x\nOMNI. I just did a play earlier today. Was one of the gainers. \n\nMany others. Just make sure it’s not spiking because it will be delisted (I got screed lie this) at midnight AND the market cap is large enough for you to sell. \n\nI thought a reasoning LLM would be good at it but, the LLM just ends up using the maths lie order book , volume, etc. \n\nI’m currently putting together a better code base and gui to do these as python is a scripting language and terrible with large code bases. \n\nI’ve tried various method like valet and peak detection like a person but the math predicts it much better and before it hits the visuals. \n\nThe data points used\nOrder book asks and bids   And the spread. \nAsk volume , bid volume \nVolume imbalance (calculated from those)\n\nAverages bid and ask\nPrice difference percentage \nSpread percentage \n\nThis generates a buy sell hold signal \n\nGainers check all cryptos. It uses volume, gain percentage , and detects the spike  in a short time period. \n\nBoth price change (above) and a pump detection is used for gainers. \n\nNo, I will it even post this publicly. Yes I’ll give it to family or friends (when the windows WPF app is ready). Or people that ask (means they are usually serious and will figure it out in time). \n\nThe failure of the LLMs is that they are non deterministic. And people think they can feed a trend of candles or screenshot and it will predict the future. \n\nYes it can understand both. But it’s this underlying data that is much more important.  I tried this approach also. \n\nTe LLM did essentially tutor me on trading and described the data points I was oblivious towards because I did not know. \n\nAre math people secretly making bank doing this? Only if the know how to write the scripts or know he to instruct an LLM. \n\nCheck out the order books. You’ll see these repeated quantities over and over- it’s the bots. They are out there. It is possible or they wouldn’t exist. ",

I'd ditch the 2060, keep the dual 5060Ti 16GB GPUs and try out some q4 quantized models. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised if just how much performance you can get out of those 5060s. I started my home server with a single 5060Ti 16GB and I was blown away by how much it could do. In my testing the 5060Ti was able 1/4 the speed of a 5090 I'm terms of t/s.\n\nAlso make sure when you move down to the q4 models that it's not splitting the model across both GPUs unless absolutely necessary. Like if a model is only 9GB it will fit into VRAM on a single GPU, but sometimes Ollama and lamma.cpp will split the model anyways if you give it too much context.\n\nTry that out, definitely let me know how it goes!

I think it's a decent setup if the goal is optimizing only for how large of models you can load. The practical side of how it performs is a different question. \n\n\nI do agree this doesn't seem like the most efficient way to do it, but if he has multiple gpu model loading working well, this can probably do some decent stuff, so long as you are willing to wait a bit longer than chatgpt.",
