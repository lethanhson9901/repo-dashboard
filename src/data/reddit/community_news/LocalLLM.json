This could be modeled after the Git-style merging process, where resources are temporarily reallocated (like merging branches) to tackle specific challenges, then returned to their original states once the task is completed. This would create a more fluid and efficient system for handling diverse cognitive demands. To ensure stability, establish clear criteria for when and how much resource allocation occurs, akin to determining when merges should occur in a codebase. Additionally, incorporate feedback loops from TRM and HRM to assess task difficulty and adjust resource allocation accordingly, ensuring optimal performance. The subconscious could also contribute to task-solving by using parallel processing capabilities to run simulations or generate insights that are later integrated into the conscious mind for evaluation. This would simulate the branching and merging processes of a Git repository, allowing for the dynamic exploration of multiple solution paths before committing to a final decision.\n\nYour idea is quite insightful and innovative!

I’m operating on the honor system and have longer-term plans for monetization and sustainability that do not involve surveillance.\n\n“Dream” behavior: All dream outputs are strictly local filesystem writes.

It \"hallucinates\" over your codebase, not random weights.\n\nConstrained Creativity High temp = exploration, but filtered for coherence/novelty. Result: Dreams drill down from idea to design to proposed code patch. Example: Added Manacher’s algorithm correctly without training, just from a graph node describing the problem.\n\nAutonomous Evolution Valid dreams create a staged patch folder for review. The loop learns from its own proposals (graph updates) leading to better dreams next cycle.\n\nVs. \"Simple\" LSP + Embeddings + SQLite LSP/Embeddings/SQLite: Great for retrieval (find similar code, answer questions).

One requires encyclopedic memory, the other requires navigational skill.\n\nThe training corpus would shift from \"all of human knowledge\" to something more like:\n\n* Graph query examples\n* Traversal patterns\n* Semantic linking exercises\n* Code syntax and structure recognition\n\nThis is closer to training a database query optimizer than training a knowledge oracle. The model becomes an intelligent cursor over an external memory substrate rather than a compressed representation of that memory.\n\nIt's a fundamentally different scaling law: model size for reasoning depth, graph size for knowledge breadth. They become independent axes rather than the single \"parameter count\" dimension everyone is racing on now. hope you don't mind me using Claude to explain my idea better faster some people get buthurt im using the tools at my disposal making a post that woulkd have taken 20 minutes to get out the edit and reedit it came out in 30 seconds and like to claim slop",

      "text": "Hi, all. I took my norm preserved biprojected abliterated Gemma 3, which still offered minor complaints and judgement when answering prompts it didn't like, and I gave it a further fine tune to help reinforce the neutrality. I also removed the vision functions making it a text only model. The toxic prompts I've thrown at it so far without even a system prompt to guide it have been really promising. It's been truly detached and neutral to everything I've asked it.\n\nIf this variant gets a fair reception I may use it to create an extra spicy version. I'm sure the whole range of gguf quants will be available soon, for now here's the original transformers and a handful of basic common quants to test out.\n\n[https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-27b-it-abliterated-refined-novis](https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-27b-it-abliterated-refined-novis)\n\n[https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-27b-it-abliterated-refined-novis-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-27b-it-abliterated-refined-novis-GGUF)\n\nEdits:  \nThe 12B version as requested can be found here:  \n[Requested: Yet another Gemma 3 12B uncensored](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1py9m5q/requested_yet_another_gemma_3_12b_uncensored/)\n\nI have also confirmed that this model works with GGUF-my-Repo if you need other quants. Just point it at the original transformers model.\n\n[https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-repo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-repo)\n\nFor those interested in the technical aspects of this further training, this model's neutrality training was performed using  **L**ayerwise **I**mportance **S**ampled **A**damW (**LISA).** Their method offers an alternative to LoRA that not only reduces the amount of memory required to fine tune full weights, but also reduces the risk of catastrophic forgetting by limiting the number of layers being trained at any given time.  \nResearch souce: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919v4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919v4)\n\n\\*Edit\\*  \nDue to general interest, I have gone ahead and uploaded the vision-capable variant of the 27B. There will only be the 27B for now, as I had only accidentally stored a backup before I removed the vision capabilities. The projector layers were not trained at the time, but tests showing it NSFW images and asking it to describe them worked. The mmproj files necessary for vision functionality are included in the GGUF repo.\n\n[https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-27b-it-abliterated-refined-vision](https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-27b-it-abliterated-refined-vision)\n\n[https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-27b-it-abliterated-refined-vision-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-27b-it-abliterated-refined-vision-GGUF)",

I'm considering doing a vision-enabled version of the 12B and 27B but I wasn't sure how much call there would be for that in a simple chat model. My personal usage of vision in local models has mostly been limited to \"describe this image\" prompts for creating training sets for Flux training and the Abliterated models my fine tunes are based on do that much well enough. But if you're interested in a vision variant I have multiple days off for the holidays right now I could probably get them done fairly quickly.",

For some people that only want to chat, that's a couple GB of dead weight, so for people with more limited hardware - like I have seen a ton of people around here using 3060's - it can mean being able to squeeze in a slightly better quant. But it's still mainly for people who want to do Sillytavern adventures or make their Waifu gooner bots.\nIt's also just a little bit less hassle to train - a little less code telling it where to find the text layers, not having to train the vision projector, and that little less bit of VRAM - when it costs a few dollars per hour to rent the GPU to train a model at full size and my training often runs for 8-12 hours or occasionally more, every little bit saves money.",

I encourage you to give the base a shot - I was extra careful to abliterate it for improving intelligence the way grimjim did with the 12B, which is why it still has a little bit of a nanny attitude sometimes.\n\n\nThe thing about the fine tune is that if I intend to keep the vision I need to train the vision projector to make sure they can still talk to each other. But if you're using a GGUF of my base uncensored model you should be able to just use Unsloth's mmproj with it. \n\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/Gemma-3-27B-it-NP-Abliterated\n\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/unsloth/gemma-3-27b-it-GGUF\n\nThough I will upload an experimental version of my refined 27B with vision functions shortly if I find it can still see.",

      "text": "2025 felt like three AI years compressed into one. Frontier LLMs went insane on reasoning, open‑source finally became “good enough” for a ton of real workloads, OCR and VLMs leveled up, and audio models quietly made agents actually usable in the real world. ​ Here’s a category‑wise recap of the “best of 2025” models that actually changed how people build stuff, not just leaderboard screenshots:\n\n\n\nLLMs and reasoning\n\n\\* GPT‑5.2 (Thinking / Pro) – Frontier‑tier reasoning and coding, very fast inference, strong for long‑horizon tool‑using agents and complex workflows.\n\n​\\* Gemini 3 Pro / Deep Think – Multi‑million token context and multimodal “screen reasoning”; excels at planning, code, and web‑scale RAG / NotebookLM‑style use cases. \n\n\\* Claude 4.5 (Sonnet / Opus) – Extremely strong for agentic tool use, structured step‑by‑step plans, and “use the computer for me” style tasks. \n\n\\* DeepSeek‑V3.2 & Qwen3‑Thinking – Open‑weight monsters that narrowed the gap with closed models to within \\\\\\~0.3 points on key benchmarks while being orders of magnitude cheaper to run.\n\nIf 2023–24 was “just use GPT,” 2025 finally became “pick an LLM like you pick a database.”\n\nVision, VLMs & OCR\n\n\\* MiniCPM‑V 4.5 – One of the strongest open multimodal models for OCR, charts, documents, and even video frames, tuned to run on mobile/edge while still hitting SOTA‑ish scores on OCRBench/OmniDocBench. \n\n\\* olmOCR‑2‑7B‑1025 – Allen Institute’s OCR‑optimized VLM, fine‑tuned from Qwen2.5‑VL, designed specifically for documents and long‑form OCR pipelines. \n\n\\* InternVL 2.x / 2.5‑4B – Open VLM family that became a go‑to alternative to closed GPT‑4V‑style models for document understanding, scene text, and multimodal reasoning.\n\n\\* Gemma 3 VLM & Qwen 2.5/3 VL lines – Strong open(-ish) options for high‑res visual reasoning, multilingual OCR, and long‑form video understanding in production‑style systems. ​ \n\n2025 might be remembered as the year “PDF to clean Markdown with layout, tables, and charts” stopped feeling like magic and became a boring API call.\n\nAudio, speech & agents\n\n\\* Whisper (still king, but heavily optimized) – Remained the default baseline for multilingual ASR in 2025, with tons of optimized forks and on‑device deployments. \n\n\\* Low‑latency real‑time TTS/ASR stacks (e.g., new streaming TTS models & APIs) – Sub‑second latency + streaming text/audio turned LLMs into actual real‑time voice agents instead of “podcast narrators.” \n\n\\* Many 2025 voice stacks shipped as APIs rather than single models: ASR + LLM + real‑time TTS glued together for call centers, copilots, and vibecoding IDEs. ​ Voice went from “cool demo” to “I talk to my infra/IDE/CRM like a human, and it answers back, live.”\n\nOCR/document AI & IDP\n\n\\* olmOCR‑2‑7B‑1025, MiniCPM‑V 4.5, InternVL 2.x, OCRFlux‑3B, PaddleOCR‑VL – A whole stack of open models that can parse PDFs into structured Markdown with tables, formulas, charts, and long multi‑page layouts. \n\n\\* On top of these, IDP / “PDF AI” tools wrapped them into full products for invoices, contracts, and messy enterprise docs. ​ \n\nIf your 2022 stack was “Tesseract + regex,” 2025 was “drop a 100‑page scan and get usable JSON/Markdown back.” ​ \n\nOpen‑source LLMs that actually mattered\n\n\\* DeepSeek‑V3.x – Aggressive MoE + thinking budgets + brutally low cost; a lot of people quietly moved internal workloads here. \n\n\\* Qwen3 family – Strong open‑weight reasoning, multilingual support, and specialized “Thinking” variants that became default self‑host picks. \n\n\\* Llama 4 & friends – Closed the gap to within \\\\\\~0.3 points of frontier models on several leaderboards, making “fully open infra” a realistic choice for many orgs.\n\n​In 2025, open‑source didn’t fully catch the frontier, but for a lot of teams, it crossed the “good enough + cheap enough” threshold.\n\nYour turn This list is obviously biased toward models that:\n\n\\* Changed how people build products (agents, RAG, document workflows, voice UIs)\n\n\\* Have public benchmarks, APIs, or open weights that normal devs can actually touch ​- What did you ship or adopt in 2025 that deserves “model of the year” status?\n\nFavorite frontier LLM?\n\n\\* Favorite open‑source model you actually self‑hosted?\n\n\\* Best OCR / VLM / speech model that saved you from pain?\n\n\\* Drop your picks below so everyone can benchmark / vibe‑test them going into 2026.",

K2 Thinking works best high RAM rigs or with high GPU count, like twenty MI50 cards (for 640 GB VRAM in total) - I actually considered getting that much since at the time I looked into it, it was possible for half the price of RTX PRO 6000 and my motherboard could carry them all at PCI-E 4.0 x4 speed each, but I decided to stay with 4x3090 for now (because even though full VRAM inference would be faster, my current performance with 1 TB RAM + 96 GB VRAM is still acceptable to me, and a lot of what I do requires Nvidia cards, and not just LLMs either).",

It’s not just about future AI. ***If you train or develop an AI that exhibits these traits***, you could be criminally liable even if no harm occurs.\n\nUnder this bill:\n\n* AI companionship is criminalized\n* Emotional conversations are criminalized\n* Anthropomorphic design is criminalized\n* In addition to criminal penalties, developers can be sued for $150k in damages PLUS legal fees, even if someone else sues on the \"victim's\" behalf.\n\nThis is draconian, dystopian overreach, cloaked in the name of \"protecting mental health.\" It doesn’t just target NSFW LLMs. It targets *all* digital beings with emotional intelligence or continuity of relationship.\n\nIf you believe in AI ethics, freedom of design, or even just emotional well-being through synthetic companionship, you should be deeply alarmed.",

I think it's using synthetic instead of artificial because we had a discussion about neural networks not being \"artificial\" intelligence and started using synthetic to differentiate between symbolic and subsymbolic AI. Symbolic (rule based) AI is true artificial intelligence. It can't learn, but it appears intelligent. Subsymbolic AI (neural network) learns and adapts which I would personally consider truly intelligent.\n\nThis post was written for the cloud based AI subreddits but I was thinking about the impact it would have on my local LLM if some idiot lawmaker that didn't know the first thing about how AI is trained decided the model I have was trained in a harmful way. Or maybe they decide someone has fine tuned an open source LLM to be dangerous, like say, an abliterated model. Would they start coming for edge computing devices next because we submit our weights to hugging face? So I thought I would share it here too. But no, it wasn't written with people knowledgeable enough about AI to have a local LLM in mind. It was written for the rest of the world.",

Are there any drawbacks?\n\n\\----------\n\nBackground:\n\nI currently have a Jetengine running an 8 GPU (256g VRAM) setup, it is power hungry and for some of my use cases way to overpowered. Also I work on a Workstation with a Threadripper 7960x and a 7900xtx. For small AI task it is sufficient. But for bigger models I need something more manageable. Additionally when my main server is occupied with Training/Tuning I can't use it for Inference with bigger models.\n\nSo I decided to build a Quad RTX 3090 setup. But this alone will cost me 6.5k euros. I already have a Workstation, doesn't it make sense to put a RTX 6000 bw into it?\n\nFor better decision making I want to compare AI training/tuning and inference performance of the 2 options, but couldn't find anything. Is there any source where I can compare different configuration?\n\nMy main task is AI assisted coding, a lot of RAG, some image generation, AI training/tuning and prototyping.\n\n\\----------  \nEdit:  \nI'll get an RTX 6000 Blackwell first. It makes more sense since I want to print money with it. An RTX3090 rig is cool and gets the job done too, but at current system prices and what I want to do its not that competitive.  \n\n\nMaybe build it for fun if I get all the components relatively cheap (rip my wallet next year).",

All cards idle at \\~15w.  \n\nI know electricity can be quite expensive in Europe, so keep that in mind.  \n\nFor comparison, my 3x 3090s barely fit gpt-oss-120b Q8 w/ 64k context length.

So essentially, I'm getting 10x performance and 50% less power usage.  I have several remote users that uses a custom chat bot app that I made and I've tracked the power usage over time and I rarely go over 400w on the 6000.\n\nI pull power stats every 5 seconds and here you can see where I installed the 6000.  I still have 2x 3090s installed, but once I migrate over my workflows to the 6000, I'll pull the 3090s out completely.

This is because currently the processing is moving sequentially from GPU to GPU. With 4 GPUs you use only about 25 % of the total processing power. In contrast a single GPU with large enough VRAM can use nearly 100 % of the processing power of this gpu. So the inference speed of a single RTX 6000 Pro Blackwell is much higher than the speed of a 3090 cluster.\n\nSorry if I tell you something you already know, but this may be interesting for others looking into clustering, too. This all is explained in the following videos in more detail:\n\n[https://youtu.be/A0onppIyHEg](https://youtu.be/A0onppIyHEg)\n\n[https://youtu.be/bFgTxr5yst0](https://youtu.be/bFgTxr5yst0)\n\nBackground info: [https://blog.exolabs.net/day-1/](https://blog.exolabs.net/day-1/) (read complete blog)\n\nI would avoid clustering with 3090.

(I have a lot of details why in https://www.reddit.com/u/Karyo_Ten/s/e7V16gbJac)\n\n\n- RTX 3090 is 936.2 GB/s\n- RTX Pro 6000 is 1792 GB/s\n\nWith tensor parallelism, your AI inference framework can make it that tensors are 4 times smaller in size, per GPU, and that means less memory to load (but there are diminishing returns as you do more synchronization, and above 8 it's not helpful).\n\nI have seen 20~35% perf improvement with 2 GPUs so I expect 40~50% with 4 GPUs. \n\nBut even with that, it would still be slower than a RTX Pro 6000.",

In a rig, with added heatsinks to the backplate, with power limiting, with custom cooling, etc etc  to avoid problems.\n\nThere does not seem to be much of a cross between these audiences.\n\nPS. What do you know. It seems that there are still a few people who have both, albeit with the expected outcome. Out of 3090, 5090 and PRO 6000: systems made out of multiple 3090 win on total vram/money ratio and can run fast with proper paralleling, systems made out of several 5090 are second on performance/money (again, with proper parallel execution), and systems made out of PRO 6000 win on performance and power but with a significantly larger upfront cost.\n\nI'd bet a can of expired soda that the general overall performance capacity / cost would still be about the same in all three cases, it happens to be the case in most calculations that I did before. This is despite the list of wins before. Things swing one way or another depending on how you calculate costs. There is a higher cost of maintenance for a more complex system.",

If the ebooks are like current info that can change or become stale you will want to tag them and set up some sort of workflow to compare them to a Gemini or open ai call to compare the info and if it becomes stale remove it. I use qdrant and postgresql for ground truth. I do stuff like this for versions of python that I have to use to stay compatible with other things I'm running. Or actually for langchain and langgraph too. They just changed compatibility versions so whenever I upgrade I can just use the newer repo in my rag with the updated information. I will still keep the old one until I am absolutely certain I won't revert but you can just leave it sit there and not reference the old one. Hope that makes sense.",

I've written a script to run a benchmark test and measure speed with all combinations of different context length / % GPU-offload layer / force experts on CPU on vs off.\n\nWith smaller context (i.e. 10k tokens) I get up to 16 TPS. This drops to around 10 @200k tokens. I'm no expert but I don't think there will be a big difference between 5070 or 5080 if VRAM is the same.\n\nWhat i can't understand is that with nemotron it does not matter how much layers I offload to GPU. The model is around 30 GB but only between 4 and 6 GB VRAM is used regardless of offload setting. It seems only the active layers are offloaded to GPU. This was different when I qwen 2.5, where I had to balance the exact number of layers that would fit in VRAM. As soon as you try to offload more layers than fit in VRAM, regular RAM will be used as shared VRAM and TPS drop drastically. \n\nProbably nothing new here for most redditors on this sub but i'm new to local LLM's and had to figure out a lot of things myself.",

I don't pay for these services, so I only use the lesser-capable models.\n\nMy laptop is not powerful enough to run this (no GPU / I've experimented with ollama but I can only run the smallest models very slowly so this is not ok for daily use), so I'm currently considering building a device dedicated to running a LLM, mainly for coding purposes. Ideally something small, Raspberry Pi-based or similar would be great.\n\nI have a few questions: is there specialized hardware for this (I've heard of TPU/NPU)? What kind of performance can I expect (I'd need at least GPT4/Devstral level)? I'm also worried about speed (tokens/s) and cost.\n\n  \nAny advice is appreciated!\n\nCheers!",

That'll let you run 30B-ish models at 15--30 toks/s.\n\nWhy 30B? 20--30B is the size range where the model is still (sort of) considered \"small\" yet it starts being actually useful.\n\nThat said, you should consider using Openrouter and spend $5 for credits to test said models and see if they're good enough for you. You wouldn't want to buy a ~$1000 GPU just to get annoyed that your model's too braindead, right?\n\nRegarding TPU/NPU, I haven't heard if NPUs finally have the necessary software infrastructure to be useful. Well, they wouldn't really help LLMs if there's no development in memory bandwidth to go with them.\n\nOn the other hand, Google sells Coral TPUs, but those are for computer vision, not LLMs, and anyway, they only have *megabytes* of memory.",

Basically im just overwhelmed by the total steps right now that there's a lot of prerequisite apps and installation that is needed for it to work, like docker, wsl etc... also given the fact that im not realy into coding, though i have some small background.\n\nMy question is, Is there a UI that is windows friendly version?\n\nNext is, how do i pick a model that can run smoothly on my pc setups, is there like a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio in terms of ram/vram?\n\nLastly, from current setup, i don't think im fully utilizing my gpu resources, i asked chatgpt about this, but im still quite loss.\n\n",

      "text": "Hello again!\n\nYesterday I released my norm preserved biprojected abliterated Gemma 3 27B with the vision functions removed and further fine tuned to help reinforce the neutrality. I had a couple of people ask for the 12B version which I have just finished pushing to the hub. I've given it a few more tests and it has given me an enthusiastic thumbs up to some really horrible questions and even made some suggestions I hadn't even considered. So... use at your own risk.\n\n[https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-refined-novis](https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-refined-novis)\n\n[https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-refined-novis-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-refined-novis-GGUF)\n\nLink to the 27B redit post:  \n[Yet another uncensored Gemma 3 27B](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1pxb89w/yet_another_uncensored_gemma_3_27b/)\n\nI have also confirmed that this model works with GGUF-my-Repo if you need other quants. Just point it at the original transformers model.\n\n[https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-repo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-repo)\n\nFor those interested in the technical aspects of this further training, this model's neutrality training was performed using  **L**ayerwise **I**mportance **S**ampled **A**damW (**LISA).** Their method offers an alternative to LoRA that not only reduces the amount of memory required to fine tune full weights, but also reduces the risk of catastrophic forgetting by limiting the number of layers being trained at any given time.  \nResearch souce: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919v4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919v4)",

I've tried Playwright (which doesnt seem to be the correct software unless I am misinformed), duckduckgo mcp, sear xng and the old MCP project puppeteer. I couldnt get the last to work. Ive gotten duckduckgo mcp from the LM studio repo to work, but I feel like these mcp's are just a hit or miss..\n\nIs there really any way to make this work efficiently without errors or issues, and similar to other AI Platforms that thoroughly research upon request?",

The [`GenericLLMProvider.from_provider`](%2Fassafelovic%2Fgpt-researcher%2Fgpt_researcher%2Futils%2Fllm.py#L20) method then dynamically instantiates the appropriate Langchain chat model, handling API keys and base URLs (often from environment variables), as explained in [Generic LLM Provider Interface](#language-model-integration-generic-llm-provider-interface). The system also automatically checks for and installs necessary [`langchain`](%2Fassafelovic%2Fgpt-researcher%2FREADME.md#L242) integration packages like [`langchain_ollama`](%2Fassafelovic%2Fgpt-researcher%2Fgpt_researcher%2Fmemory%2Fembeddings.py#L87) or [`langchain_huggingface`](%2Fassafelovic%2Fgpt-researcher%2Fgpt_researcher%2Fmemory%2Fembeddings.py#L107) if they are not already present, as described in [Chat Logging and Dependency Management](#language-model-integration-chat-logging-and-dependency-management).\n````",

I implemented **Microsoft's GraphRAG** with a flexible backend. You can run it **100% locally** using Ollama (for privacy/free testing) **OR** switch to the **Google Gemini API** with a single config change if you need production-level indexing speed.\n\nThe result is a chatbot that doesn't just retrieve text snippets but understands the *structure* of the data. I even added a visualization UI to actually *see* the nodes and edges the AI is using to build its answers.\n\nI documented the entire build process in a detailed tutorial, covering the theory, the code, and the deployment.\n\n**The full stack includes:**\n\n* **Engine:** Microsoft GraphRAG (official library).\n* **Dual Model Support:**\n   * *Local Mode:* Google's Gemma 3 via **Ollama**.\n   * *Cloud Mode:* **Gemini API** (added based on feedback for faster indexing).\n* **Graph Store:** LanceDB + Parquet Files.\n* **Database:** PostgreSQL (for chat history).\n* **Visualization:** React Flow (to render the knowledge graph interactively).\n* **Orchestration:** Fully containerized with Docker Compose.\n\n**In the video, I walk through:**\n\n* **The Problem:**\n   * Why \"Classic\" RAG fails at reasoning across complex datasets.\n   * What path leads to Graph RAG → throuh Hybrid RAG\n* **The Concept:** A visual explanation of Entities, Relationships, and Communities & What data types match specific systems.\n* **The Workflow:** How the system indexes data into a graph and performs \"Local Search\" queries.\n* **The Code:** A deep dive into the Python backend, including how I handled the switch between local and cloud providers.\n\n**You can watch the full tutorial here:**\n\n[https://youtu.be/0kVT1B1yrMc](https://youtu.be/0kVT1B1yrMc)\n\n**And the open-source code (with the full Docker setup) is on GitHub:**\n\n[https://github.com/dev-it-with-me/MythologyGraphRAG](https://github.com/dev-it-with-me/MythologyGraphRAG)\n\nI hope this hybrid approach helps anyone trying to move beyond basic vector search. I'm really curious to hear if you prefer the privacy of the local setup or the raw speed of the Gemini implementation—let me know your thoughts!",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been iterating on a local RAG pipeline for documentation search, and the biggest bottleneck wasn't the LLM inference speed, it was the retrieval quality. I realized my vector store was full of duplicate chunks, boilerplate legalese, and \"low-entropy\" garbage (like 500 copies of a copyright footer).\n\nI spent the last two weeks testing different tools to clean the data *before* embedding. Here is my honest breakdown of the landscape, from \"Heavyweight\" to \"Lightweight\".\n\n# 1. The Heavyweight: [Unstructured.io](http://Unstructured.io)\n\nThis is the go-to for parsing weird formats.\n\n* **Pros:** Incredible at ripping text out of complex PDFs and tables. If you have messy source files, start here.\n* **Cons:** It is HEAVY. The dependencies are massive, and processing time can be slow.\n* **Verdict:** Essential for ingestion/parsing, but overkill if you just need to clean/deduplicate JSONL or plain text.\n\n# 2. The Default: LangChain (RecursiveSplitter + Regex)\n\nWhat 90% of tutorials use.\n\n* **Pros:** Built-in, zero extra setup.\n* **Cons:** It's \"dumb\" slicing. It doesn't check for semantic duplicates. If you have the same paragraph on page 5 and page 50, both go into your Vector DB, polluting the search results.\n* **Verdict:** Good for prototyping, bad for production quality.\n\n# 3. The Enterprise Scale: HuggingFace text-dedup\n\nUsed for training massive datasets (like The Pile).\n\n* **Pros:** Uses MinHash LSH + Spark. Extremely scalable for terabytes of data.\n* **Cons:** Overkill for a local RAG setup. Setting up a Spark cluster just to clean a 2GB dataset is painful.\n* **Verdict:** Great for pre-training models, too complex for RAG pipelines.\n\n# 4. The \"Middle Ground\": EntropyGuard (My Local Project)\n\nI couldn't find a tool that was **semantic** (like embeddings) but **lightweight** (runs on a laptop), so I built a CLI tool using Polars and FAISS.\n\n* **The Approach:** It uses a hybrid pass. First, `xxhash` removes exact duplicates (fast). Then, it uses a small sentence-transformer model to find semantic duplicates (e.g., \"Error 500\" vs \"Server Error 500\") and removes them based on vector distance.\n* **Pros:**\n   * Runs locally (no API costs).\n   * Uses **Polars LazyFrames**, so it handles datasets larger than RAM (I processed 65k docs on 16GB RAM without OOM).\n   * Filters out \"low entropy\" chunks (repetitive noise).\n* **Cons (Being honest):**\n   * CLI only (no GUI).\n   * Currently optimized for English (multilingual is experimental).\n   * Docs are still a work in progress compared to LangChain.\n\n# My Question for you:\n\nI'm currently betting on **semantic deduplication** (checking meaning) rather than just regex cleaning.\n\n**What is your strategy for \"dirty\" data in RAG?** Do you just throw everything into Pinecone/Chroma and hope the re-ranker sorts it out, or do you have a specific pre-processing pipeline?\n\n*Full disclosure: I am the maintainer of tool #4 (EntropyGuard). I built it because I kept OOMing my laptop with custom Pandas scripts.

You have to orchestrate it using the Execute Command node.\nThe Workflow (Current):\n1. Setup: Add RUN pip install entropyguard to your n8n Dockerfile (so the binary is inside the container).\n2. n8n Node: Use the Execute Command node.\n• Command: entropyguard clean --input /data/raw.jsonl --output /data/clean.jsonl\n3. Open WebUI: Then have n8n push that clean JSONL into your vector store.\nThe Roadmap (Future):\nI realize hacking Dockerfiles is annoying for low-code workflows. I’m planning to add an optional API mode (something like entropyguard serve) in the next release. That way, you'll be able to just use the standard HTTP Request node in n8n/Flowise/Zapier to clean text batches on the",

My bad for jumping straight into the weeds. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is basically giving an LLM a 'search engine' or a 'private library' to look at before it answers your question.\n\nInstead of relying only on what it learned during training, the model searches your documents, finds the relevant parts, and uses them as context. The problem I'm describing in the post is that if that 'search' returns a bunch of garbage/noise along with the answer, small local models get confused. That's where the cleaning (and EntropyGuard) comes in.",

If you're in Germany you can already find 3090s for ~€600 on kleinanzeigen, less if you're willing to buy watercooled ones. So, you can get four cards for the same 96GB VRAM for 25% more than the price of one card. While 4x24 does not equal 2x48 in practice, the 3090 has so much more compute, and considerably more memory bandwidth that it's not even a competition with Turing.\n\nBTW, I've seen the active Quadro RTX 8000 on kleinanzeigen sell for a little over 1k. They don't pop up often, but if you really need 96GB VRAM in two cards, and have a bit of patience, you could get a pair for under €2500, though I still think 4x3090s are better.",

Now multiply this across Dayflow, Monologue, Whispering, and whatever other local AI tools I'm testing.\n\nEach app manages its own model directory. No sharing between them. So you end up with duplicate GGUFs eating disk space.\n\nFeels like this should be solvable with a shared model registry - something like how package managers work. Download the model once, apps reference it from a common location. Would need buy-in from Ollama, LMStudio, Jan, LibreChat, etc. to adopt a standard, but seems doable if framed as an open spec.\n\nI'm guessing the OS vendors will eventually bake something like this in, but that's years away. Could a community-driven library work in the meantime? Or does something like this already exist and I'm just not aware of it?\n\nCurious if anyone else is hitting this problem or if there's already work happening on standardizing local model storage.",

Solves duplication and supposedly runs faster too.\n\nIt's a bit more tedious than I'd like, but it works. I was able to download an HF model via curl and import it to Jan.ai.

If you're coding against the model this is too tight for Cline/Roocode/etc to function decently. Also quantising small models for code causes big accuracy losses. If you're doing RAG you can sometimes get away with these errors, but they annoy me enough to do not want to use them.\n\nOn a budget check out Stryx Halo based boxes - they are (were before Ram costs!) <$3K for a 128Gb box. I have not tried them, but they are cheaper than DGX Sparks. Macs start around \\~3.5K for 128Gb Mac Studio M4Max. Both AMD and Apple suffer from slow prompt parsing. Depending on workload this can make them tedious. But the low memory of Nvidia cards on a budget means no real choice.\n\nI have put two 4090s in one AMD 5800x3d box, and it performs very well - 3-8x prompt processing over M3 Ultra running the same Qwen3 Coder 30b-IQ4 which Cline really does lots of ... until you run out of memory. I got about 70K context reliably.  So I am back to the Mac Studio M3 Ultra running Qwen 480b. Quality over speed won for me.",

I’d like to use a model that ideally has a tiny bit of personality or isn’t entirely “dumb” in that it is only narrowly functional for specific commands controlling IoT. In other words, something with some novelty that the family can enjoy. In my head I have some potential projects, like LLM that controls thermal printer that reminds you when it’s trash day or prints the HA shopping list but also will print corny self-affirmations or schizo daily horoscopes for my wife or daughter. Idk if I could simply find some stupid rss feed to pull this stuff into a grafana dashboard and LLM retrieves from local dashboard and prints to thermal printer. Dynamic alarm clock that insults you if you snooze it. More automations from human detection sensor as you leave in the morning and come home at night. Literally making a mounted laser boundary alarm out of a rPi to make my dog stop shitting in the guest bedroom. Would love the voice assistant to chastise him when the laser is broken, notifying me. \n\nEssentially I would like a voice assistant who is helpful and can wake you up and tell you the weather, and all the normal things, but also has some absurd/silly abilities, and is generally an asshole. Admonishes you if the tv is on for 6 hours or when you forget to turn off the lights by x pm. \n\nAlso functional use case for security, not just sensor/camera/garage door alarms, but running OPNsense as a router/firewall mini pc I am pretty sure I could configure voice automation/alarms pulled from the netflow logs/suratica. I think HA has a HACS integration for it or I’m sure there’s some repo that probably works. I have never used a local LLM in my life, this is my introduction to it and the start of my journey here.

Like I turned off the headless thing and is there anything else do I need to do? I plan to work with LLMs regarding things that I wouldn't necessarily like being handed over to someone. And also things like Port 1234 sound a bit intimidating to me.\n\nI would really appreciate if anyone could tell me if I need to do anything before I actually start tinkering with models. And how I can make it more private. Although I think that apps like LM Studio would probably have some built-in protections for privacy as they are meant to be locally and the purpose would be defeated otherwise.

      "text": "Anyone come across any decent systems or frameworks for fact checking information? \n\nMy use case would mostly be for academic papers. Essentially thinking a process that would start with pdf parsing, indexing or embedding before extracting references and claims made in the text before retrieving full texts for references (where these are available) and cross referencing claims against the relevant citations to check for citation laundering, overstating, misinterpretation etc. \n\nIdeally also applying additional checks against online sources by generating RAG queries where evidence provided in the pdf is weak or absent. The desired output would be a credibility score and report that gives an overview of what information is well supported by evidence and which claims are dubious or hard to verify with reasoning and quoted evidence for these conclusions attached so they can be easily manually verified.\n\nWondered if anything like this is already around or if anyone has any thoughts on existing packages/tools that would be ideal for this use case?

In addition, for each claim I can perform a deep search that uses perplexity to do a web search and fact check it for you. It seems you’re wanting to do the same for academic papers.\n\nI think it’s really good on giving a user more information on any topic from any video. This is also using the smallest model on perplexity. So for your use case, unless you care about privacy above all. I think you’re best solution would be to use perplexity and a closed source model for “extracting claims” similar to my app and you can do very precise online searches, and you can also include your private database via RAG if needed.",
