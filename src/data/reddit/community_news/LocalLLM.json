Claude OAuth (the easiest) or API keys (more control over costs). For beginners, OAuth with a Claude Pro subscription is the simplest path.”\n\nNow I’m over even playing around with this thing for the rest of the day. \n\nMy two cents: The MacOS app is nice but you have to build it from source. Also good luck getting app auth setup properly if you are using a remote machine.",

Jarvis (soon to be TRION) has now been provided with a self-developed SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP.\n\nI would love to explain everything it can do in this Reddit post. But I don't have the space, and neither do you have the patience. [u/frank\\_brsrk](/user/frank_brsrk/) Provided a self-developed CIM framework That's hard twisted with Sequential Thinking.

All local, all Ollama.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n\\- Complex questions → AI breaks them into steps\n\n\\- You SEE the reasoning live (not just the answer)\n\n\\- Reduces hallucinations significantly\n\nThe cool part: The AI decides WHEN to use deep thinking.\n\nSimple questions → instant answer.\n\nComplex questions → step-by-step reasoning first.\n\nBuilt with: Ollama + DeepSeek-R1 + custom MCP servers\n\nShoutout to [u/frank\\_brsrk](/user/frank_brsrk/) for the CIM framework that makes\n\nthe reasoning actually make sense.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/danny094/Jarvis/tree/main](https://github.com/danny094/Jarvis/tree/main)\n\nHappy to answer questions! This took weeks to build 😅\n\nOther known issues:\n\n\\- excessively long texts, skipping the control layer - Solution in progress\n\n\\- The side panel is still being edited and will be integrated as a canvas with MCP support.\n\nsimple graphic:\n\n[Simple visualization of MCP retrieval](https://preview.redd.it/f9tm59rkd4fg1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a65eda552b3b846863f75c59ee04018eb6d6c41)\n\n[Simple visualization pipeline](https://preview.redd.it/6h40kd1sd4fg1.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=770dd510d8ebf0fe8b68f6a81bb7ab40d34fa862)\n\n@/[frank\\_brsrk](/user/frank_brsrk/) architecture of the causal intelligence module\n\n[architecture of the causal intelligence module](https://preview.redd.it/6x03fioje4fg1.jpg?width=2800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7df7325899fd7dd3f8ca8743ebca4d04845868b5)\n\n\n\nSmall update the next days:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9q7vo4rnbqfg1.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=193c2a1adaabd721b0c04a8386dd9acf3b49f5ff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwcvm4rnbqfg1.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=2457293e38992f70ff8290fada20104b19756a16\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ej38q5rnbqfg1.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=efd4b330ed74bc48e9af713cc0e5568b94c3a5f7\n\n  \n",

Thanks for helping the rest of us in the struggle to keep up!\n\nI'll be more focused one these types of projects when they eventually fire me because they don't realize how much we have to correct the AI still but I wish I had time to be consistent working on some joint projects like this. I'm trying to figure out how to piece together things like roo code with something like vibe kanban and MCPs in an opinionated way to reduce the manual burden while allowing more than coding using local LLMs and then here goes Anthropic with their cowork thing lol\n\nKeep up the hard work!

So permissions end up living either:\n\n* inside prompts (brittle),\n* inside per-tool wrappers (boilerplate explosion),\n* or at the MCP server boundary (coarse, hard to reason about).\n\nThe isolation vs over-permission tradeoff you mention is exactly what happens when there’s no **deny-by-default execution layer** sitting *between* the model and the tools.\n\nWhat’s worked best for us locally is:\n\n* keep MCP servers dumb (pure capability exposure)\n* move auth, cost limits, logging, and allow/deny decisions into a single runtime gate\n* treat every tool call as an auditable event, not “just another function call”\n\nThat way you’re not re-implementing auth + logging per connector, and you’re not trusting the model to behave just because the prompt says so.\n\nI agree it *should* be more native / standardized. Until there’s a real spec for agent execution (not just tool schemas), everyone’s either rolling wrappers or accepting scary permissions.\n\nCurious what level you’re aiming for locally:\n\n* human-in-the-loop approvals?\n* strict allowlists?\n* cost / rate enforcement?\n* or just “don’t nuke my data”?\n\nThat choice seems to drive everything else.",

      "text": "**The Case for a $600 Local LLM Machine**\n\nUsing the Base Model Mac mini M4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5c916gwucoeg1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d91da71f6244d752e15922e47dfbf9d792beb1\n\nby Tony Thomas\n\nIt started as a simple experiment. How much real work could I do on a small, inexpensive machine running language models locally?\n\nWith GPU prices still elevated, memory costs climbing, SSD prices rising instead of falling, power costs steadily increasing, and cloud subscriptions adding up, it felt like a question worth answering. After a lot of thought and testing, the system I landed on was a base model Mac mini M4 with 16 GB of unified memory, a 256 GB internal SSD, a USB-C dock, and a 1 TB external NVMe drive for model storage. Thanks to recent sales, the all-in cost came in right around $600.\n\nOn paper, that does not sound like much. In practice, it turned out to be far more capable than I expected.\n\nLocal LLM work has shifted over the last couple of years. Models are more efficient due to better training and optimization. Quantization is better understood. Inference engines are faster and more stable. At the same time, the hardware market has moved in the opposite direction. GPUs with meaningful amounts of VRAM are expensive, and large VRAM models are quietly disappearing. DRAM is no longer cheap. SSD and NVMe prices have climbed sharply.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, a compact system with tightly integrated silicon starts to look less like a compromise and more like a sensible baseline.\n\n**Why the Mac mini M4 Works**\n\nThe M4 Mac mini stands out because Apple’s unified memory architecture fundamentally changes how a small system behaves under inference workloads. CPU and GPU draw from the same high-bandwidth memory pool, avoiding the awkward juggling act that defines entry-level discrete GPU setups. I am not interested in cramming models into a narrow VRAM window while system memory sits idle. The M4 simply uses what it has efficiently.\n\nSixteen gigabytes is not generous, but it is workable when that memory is fast and shared. For the kinds of tasks I care about, brainstorming, writing, editing, summarization, research, and outlining, it holds up well. I spend my time working, not managing resources.\n\nThe 256 GB internal SSD is limited, but not a dealbreaker. Models and data live on the external NVMe drive, which is fast enough that it does not slow my workflow. The internal disk handles macOS and applications, and that is all it needs to do. Avoiding Apple’s storage upgrade pricing was an easy decision.\n\nThe setup itself is straightforward. No unsupported hardware. No hacks. No fragile dependencies. It is dependable, UNIX-based, and boring in the best way. That matters if you intend to use the machine every day rather than treat it as a side project.\n\n**What Daily Use Looks Like**\n\nThe real test was whether the machine stayed out of my way.\n\nQuantized 7B and 8B models run smoothly using Ollama and LM Studio. AnythingLLM works well too and adds vector databases and seamless access to cloud models when needed. Response times are short enough that interaction feels conversational rather than mechanical. I can draft, revise, and iterate without waiting on the system, which makes local use genuinely viable.\n\nLarger 13B to 14B models are more usable than I expected when configured sensibly. Context size needs to be managed, but that is true even on far more expensive systems. For single-user workflows, the experience is consistent and predictable.\n\nWhat stood out most was how quickly the hardware stopped being the limiting factor. Once the models were loaded and tools configured, I forgot I was using a constrained system. That is the point where performance stops being theoretical and starts being practical.\n\nIn daily use, I rotate through a familiar mix of models. Qwen variants from 1.7B up through 14B do most of the work, alongside Mistral instruct models, DeepSeek 8B, Phi-4, and Gemma. On this machine, smaller Qwen models routinely exceed 30 tokens per second and often land closer to 40 TPS depending on quantization and context. These smaller models can usually take advantage of the full available context without issue.\n\nThe 7B to 8B class typically runs in the low to mid 20s at context sizes between 4K and 16K. Larger 13B to 14B models settle into the low teens at a conservative 4K context and operate near the upper end of acceptable memory pressure. Those numbers are not headline-grabbing, but they are fast enough that writing, editing, and iteration feel fluid rather than constrained. I am rarely waiting on the model, which is the only metric that actually matters for my workflow.\n\n**Cost, Power, and Practicality**\n\nAt roughly $600, this system occupies an important middle ground. It costs less than a capable GPU-based desktop while delivering enough performance to replace a meaningful amount of cloud usage. Over time, that matters more than peak benchmarks.\n\nThe Mac mini M4 is also extremely efficient. It draws very little power under sustained inference loads, runs silently, and requires no special cooling or placement. I routinely leave models running all day without thinking about the electric bill.\n\nThat stands in sharp contrast to my Ryzen 5700G desktop paired with an Intel B50 GPU. That system pulls hundreds of watts under load, with the B50 alone consuming around 50 watts during LLM inference. Over time, that difference is not theoretical. It shows up directly in operating costs.\n\nThe M4 sits on top of my tower system and behaves more like an appliance. Thanks to my use of a KVM, I can turn off the desktop entirely and keep working. I do not think about heat, noise, or power consumption. That simplicity lowers friction and makes local models something I reach for by default, not as an occasional experiment.\n\n**Where the Limits Are**\n\nThe constraints are real but manageable. Memory is finite, and there is no upgrade path. Model selection and context size require discipline. This is an inference-first system, not a training platform.\n\nApple Silicon also brings ecosystem boundaries. If your work depends on CUDA-specific tooling or experimental research code, this is not the right machine. It relies on Apple’s Metal backend rather than NVIDIA’s stack. My focus is writing and knowledge work, and for that, the platform fits extremely well.\n\n**Why This Feels Like a Turning Point**\n\nWhat surprised me was not that the Mac mini M4 could run local LLMs. It was how well it could run them given the constraints.\n\nFor years, local AI was framed as something that required large amounts of RAM, a powerful CPU, and an expensive GPU. These systems were loud, hot, and power hungry, built primarily for enthusiasts. This setup points in a different direction. With efficient models and tightly integrated hardware, a small, affordable system can do real work.\n\nFor writers, researchers, and independent developers who care about control, privacy, and predictable costs, a budget local LLM machine built around the Mac mini M4 no longer feels experimental. It is something I turn on in the morning, leave running all day, and rely on without thinking about the hardware.\n\nMore than any benchmark, that is what matters.\n\nFrom: tonythomas-dot-net",

          "text": "You might enjoy this paper from 2024;\n\n> Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically improved their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often limit models to making only one attempt at a problem. Here, we explore inference compute as another axis for scaling, using the simple technique of repeatedly sampling candidate solutions from a model. Across multiple tasks and models, we observe that coverage -- the fraction of problems that are solved by any generated sample -- scales with the number of samples over four orders of magnitude. Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the number of samples is often log-linear and can be modelled with an exponentiated power law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. In domains like coding and formal proofs, where answers can be automatically verified, these increases in coverage directly translate into improved performance. When we apply repeated sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples, outperforming the single-sample state-of-the-art of 43%. In domains without automatic verifiers, we find that common methods for picking from a sample collection (majority voting and reward models) plateau beyond several hundred samples and fail to fully scale with the sample budget. \n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21787",

Since it's tiny, you can run it on your laptop with complete data privacy.\n\nSmall models struggle with multi-turn tool calling - out of the box, Qwen3-0.6B achieves 84% accuracy on single tool calls, which drops to **just 42% over 5 turns.** Our tuning brings this to 100% on the test set, delivering robust multi-turn performance.\n\n|Model|Parameters|Tool call accuracy (test set)|=> 5-turn tool call accuracy|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Qwen3 235B Instruct (teacher)|235B|99%|95%|\n|Qwen3 0.6B (base)|0.6B|84%|42%|\n|**Qwen3 0.6B (tuned)**|**0.6B**|**100%**|**100%**|\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/distil-labs/distil-SHELLper](https://github.com/distil-labs/distil-SHELLper)\n\nHuggingface model: [https://huggingface.co/distil-labs/distil-qwen3-0.6b-SHELLper](https://huggingface.co/distil-labs/distil-qwen3-0.6b-SHELLper)\n\n# Quick Start\n\nSet up the environment:\n\n    # Set up environment\n    python -m venv .venv\n    . .venv/bin/activate\n    pip install openai huggingface_hub\n    \n\nDowload the model:\n\n    hf download distil-labs/distil-qwen3-0.6b-SHELLper --local-dir distil_model\n    cd distil_model\n    ollama create distil_model -f Modelfile\n    cd ..\n    \n\nRun the assistant:\n\n    python filesystem_demo.py\n    \n\nThe demo prompts for confirmation before running commands (safety first) and blocks certain dangerous operations (like `rm -r /`), so feel free to try it out!\n\n# How We Trained SHELLper\n\n# The Problem\n\nSmall models really struggle with multi-turn tool calling - performance degrades as tool calls chain together, dropping with each additional turn. If we assume independent errors for each tool call (like incorrect parameter values), a model at 80% accuracy only has a 33% chance of getting through 5 turns error-free.\n\n|Single tool call accuracy|5-turn tool call accuracy|\n|:-|:-|\n|80%|33%|\n|90%|59%|\n|95%|77%|\n|99%|95%|\n\nFor this demo, we wanted to test if we could dramatically improve a small model's multi-turn performance. We started with a task from the [Berkeley function calling leaderboard](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.html) (BFCL) - the [gorilla file system tool calling task](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/blob/main/berkeley-function-call-leaderboard/bfcl_eval/data/BFCL_v4_multi_turn_base.json). We adapted it:\n\n* Original task supports multiple tool calls per turn → we restrict to one\n* Cap at 5 turns max\n* Map commands to actual bash (instead of gorilla filesystem functions)\n* Skip adding tool outputs to conversation history\n\nBasically, the same tool set, but new, simpler [train/test data.](https://github.com/distil-labs/distil-SHELLper/tree/main/data)\n\n# Training Pipeline\n\n1. **Seed Data:** We built 20 simplified training conversations covering the available tools in realistic scenarios.\n2. **Synthetic Expansion:** Using our [data synthesis pipeline](https://www.distillabs.ai/blog/small-expert-agents-from-10-examples/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=shellper), we generated thousands of training examples.\n\nSince we're dealing with variable-length conversations, we broke each conversation into intermediate steps. Example:\n\n    [Input] User: List all files => Model: ls -al => User: go to directory models\n    [Output] Model: cd models\n    \n\n... becomes 2 training points:\n\n    [Input] User: List all files\n    [Output] Model: ls -al\n    \n\n    [Input] User: List all files => Model: ls -al => User: go to directory models\n    [Output] Model: cd models`\n    \n\n1. **Fine-tuning:** We selected **Qwen3-0.6B** as the [most fine-tunable sub-1B](https://www.distillabs.ai/blog/we-benchmarked-12-small-language-models-across-8-tasks-to-find-the-best-base-model-for-fine-tuning) model with tool calling support on our platform.\n\n# Usage Examples\n\nThe assistant interprets natural language, generates bash commands, and can execute them (with Y/N confirmation).\n\n**Basic filesystem operations**\n\n    > python filesystem_demo.py\n    \n    USER: List all files in the current directory\n    COMMAND: ls\n    USER: Create a new directory called test_folder\n    COMMAND: mkdir test_folder\n    USER: Navigate to test_folder COMMAND: cd test_folder\n    \n\n# Limitations and Next Steps\n\nCurrently, we only support a basic bash tool set:\n\n* no pipes, chained commands, or multiple tool calls per turn\n* no detection of invalid commands/parameters\n* 5-turn conversation limit\n\nWe wanted to focus on the basic case before tackling complexity. Next up: multiple tool calls to enable richer agent workflows, plus benchmarking against [BFCL](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.html).\n\nFor your own bash workflows, you can log failing commands, add them to `data/train.jsonl`, and retrain with the updated data (or try a bigger student model!).\n\n# Discussion\n\nWould love to hear from the community:\n\n* Is anyone else fine-tuning small models for multi-turn tool calling?\n* What other \"focused but practical\" tasks need local, privacy-first models?",

Some key bits:\n\n> The documentation for HashIndex identifies it as a \"vectorless\" index system. This characterization is central to its \"under the hood\" operations. Instead of calculating a mathematical hash or a vector embedding, the system invokes an LLM to generate what it terms a \"semantic hash key\".  \n\n> When a document is ingested by HashIndex, it is first split into segments or pages. For each segment, the system initiates a dual-process LLM call. The first process involves generating a highly descriptive, human-readable label that encapsulates the core theme of the content. This label—for example, ``revenue_projections_FY2024_Q3``—serves as the index key in the hash map. The second process generates a concise summary of the page.\n\n> This \"single-pass\" parsing allows the document to be structured for retrieval without the need for pre-computed embedding datasets. However, the cost of this precision is time. While a traditional cryptographic hash function $H(x)$ or an embedding model can process data in milliseconds, the semantic key generation in HashIndex requires significant inference time, typically 2 to 3 seconds per page.\n\n[...]\n\n> In HashIndex, the hash table is implemented in-memory, allowing for rapid access once the indexing phase is complete. The \"hash function\" in this context is the cognitive process performed by the LLM during key generation. This approach eliminates the need for complex tree rebalancing and multi-level traversal required by systems like ChatIndex or PageIndex. However, it places a higher burden on the \"agentic\" side of the retrieval process, as the agent must now navigate a flat list of keys rather than a hierarchical tree. \n\nDoes this look like an accurate summary of how it works? Might be worth calling out that the \"hash\" in this case is not a traditional hash in the way that word is usually meant, but an LLM-generated semantic \"tag\" of sorts.",

If you need conversations, then you will certainly need a model but you don't need a 13b to do what you want. You do not even need a GPU as long as you have a good CPU and fast ram and enough ram to load the model. \n\nSince I do not know your hardware specs, I recommend you starting with [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF?show\\_file\\_info=Qwen3-4B-Q4\\_K\\_M.gguf](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF?show_file_info=Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf)\n\nYou can run that on CPU and get really good speed depending on your hardware.

For this purpose , you do not need to buy a stupid expensive card. 60 bucks will do better job than any 3060, 4060 and 5060 for this particular application and use case.\n\nwith one P102-100, you can run Piper, Whisper and Qwen 4b and get everything you wanted to do.\n\nnow, if you really want to go nuts, you can get two and then you can run Qwen30b and get these speeds.\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | ggml_cuda_init: found 2 CUDA devices:`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  |   Device 0: NVIDIA P102-100, compute capability 6.1, VMM: yes`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  |   Device 1: NVIDIA P102-100, compute capability 6.1, VMM: yes`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | load_backend: loaded CUDA backend from /app/libggml-cuda.so`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | load_backend: loaded CPU backend from /app/libggml-cpu-piledriver.so`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | | model                          |       size |     params | backend    | ngl | fa |            test |                  t/s |`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | | ------------------------------ | ---------: | ---------: | ---------- | --: | -: | --------------: | -------------------: |`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | | qwen3moe 30B.A3B IQ4_NL - 4.5 bpw |  16.12 GiB |    30.53 B | CUDA       |  99 |  1 |           pp512 |        968.28 ± 4.69 |`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | | qwen3moe 30B.A3B IQ4_NL - 4.5 bpw |  16.12 GiB |    30.53 B | CUDA       |  99 |  1 |           tg128 |         72.10 ± 0.23 |`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  |` \n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | build: 557515be1 (7819)`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1 exited with code 0`\n\n  \nabout 1,000 in prompt processing and 70+ tokens generation.\n\ntrust me, for home assistant, you will not need more than that and at that price, you will not find a better solution.\n\nAsk people that actually own P102-100, don''t take my word for it.\n\nFor this use case.... this is it.",

Both the TTS and STT need VRAM, but there are TTS like Piper than can actually run on the CPU.\n\nOne nice thing here is most voice assistants don't do a lot of context so you only need say 15% more VRAM than the LLM.\n\nYou will need to experiment to find what works for you.  Put a few bucks into OpenRouter and try the models.  A possible example would be mistral 3 8B which fits in about 7GB of VRAM.  They free models too.   Find what will work for what you want.\n\nIf I ever get some time, I plan on doing what you are trying to do.  My plan is to use a Wyse 5070 and a $50 10GB VRAM P102-100 GPU.  Not sure if I can get a smart enough model STT and TTS , but I want to try.  That setup will idle around 10 watts.  I may consider picking up a 24GB P40 as it also is pretty low idle power.   The P40 is around $200 after the needed fan to cool it.\n\nMy power is crazy expensive so cheap 16 GB GPUs like the P100 or CMP100-210 idle at 40 or 50 watts.  That is like $200/yr for me.\n\nAnyway, before dropping coin on a GPU, test out a solution with available tools like Openrouter and Huggingface.

I tried it with Q2_K in GGUF format with KoboldAI, needs with a small KV Cache around 12GB VRAM (Q4 would be around 16-18GB VRAM) and I was surprised how good it still is, but even more surprised how crazy fast it is (at least on my RTX 4090). Thanks to its MoE pipeline, where only 3B of the model is active, so it is mostly as fast as a 3B model at Q2_K would be, but of cause way better, you don't need to try a 3B at Q2_K, it will be very very bad but crazy fast. It's hard for me to use dense models now, they are so slow in comparison.\n\nSo as long you don't want to have a realtime conversation with the LLM, you can also split a some layers of the model into normal RAM. It slows down the model a bit but if you only put ~10% of the model in RAM it should stay fast enough so you can bring down the SmartHome reaction to maybe 5 seconds or lower. The only question is if you need tool calling, that could break on Q2_K, but there are ways to work around that.\n\nBut I would go for a solid 16GB VRAM card (RTX 40xx/50xx series), not too much on the low end, then you can put the LLM completely into the VRAM. So maybe a 5070TI with 16GB VRAM. No clue if a 5060TI is still fast enough. I \"only\" have a 4090 and a 5080. Could be if you get the full model into VRAM, because if not, the 5060TI has only PCIe 5 8x, the 5070TI has PCIe 5 16x, but that is only really relevant if you use offloading (splitting the model into RAM) or if the GPU is in a PCIe 5 x16 slot. If you need offloading, better don't put a PCIe 5 8x GPU into a PCIe 5 motherboard setup.\n\nBut beside that, it really depends what you want to exactly do. If you only want the bar minimum, for example only some different phrases that should react for one SmartHome function, you can do that with much much less hardware and a tiny AI model that only recognize what you want to do. Such an AI didn't need to be that smart at all, only always recognize what you want from it, you can even give it a bit the illusion of personality. But if your plan is to build your SmartHome more and more out, then a LLM is surely not a bad decision, but a more costly one.",

It has 50% more VRAM and 100% more memory bandwidth. The former lets you load bigger models, and if you have more than one 3090 there's less waste in VRAM (that's mainly a software deficiency in current inference engines). The memory bandwidth means more of the compute is accessible more of the time.\n\nThe 5070ti is abice the 3090 in terms of compute, and practically has the same memory bandwidth. So, think of the 3090 as a second 5070ti with 50% more VRAM.\n\nGenerally speaking, moar VRAM is moar better.

You can never run the amazing models you see like GPT, Claude, DeepSeek, GLM in a way that feels good. You can have 4 video cards costing 10 grand which will LOAD the model but you’ll still be generating text at 15ish/tokens a second. You’ll be running quantized models that adds additional hallucinations to LLM’s that already hallucinate a bunch.\n\nYou can get some really really cheap cloud provided services that give API access to some amazing models. In most cases what you spend on your own hardware would take 20+ years to spend on a subscription.\n\nNow if you’re doing it for pure hobby, start with GPU power. Memory will help LOAD a model and can increase max context size but it will not make the model run faster. GPU offloading is the only thing that will increase tokens/sec in a way that matters. The higher the VRAM on the GPU the better.",

          "text": "This depends on a lot of variables.\n\nHow much faff and fiddling are you realistically willing to tollerate?\n\nDo you want to be able to scale up in the future without upgrading everything? \n\nWhat exactly do you want to do with LLMs? Use them and if so how? Fine tune them? Try and train a model yourself?\n\nAre you only bothered about LLMs? Or does image generation interest you? This changes things considerably\n\nI started with your budget in mind, and before i knew it, i spent quite a bit more. \n\nIt depends what you are expecting this machine to do. That budget is tight. You could get a consumer board, cpu and single card running smaller models with high throughput, with ddr5 and pcie 5.0 for that price too.\n\nOr you could go for the old server route and go for xeon dual socket, ddr4 ecc ram and pcie 3.0. ddr4 ram is still expensive, just not as expensive as ddr5. But this option (if you choose the right board), gives you nore optionality later and slower but bigger capacity and future expandability.\n\nThey both serve different purposes. \n\nAlso, some gpus are cheaper for a reason. You can get cheap cards, but they don't have all the bells and whistles a newer card might have. At this budget, you have to choose between throughput and vram. At 2k, you might squeeze two 3090s into the build budget and maybe 4x32GB ECC RDIMMs as well, if you go with a reasonably priced lga 2011 board and xeon v4 cpus.  But factoring in psu(s), storage, cooling, a case or open frame for it, it will be tight. \n\nIf you go for an older card than a 3090 (like the P40) you might find performance disappointing, they lack fp16 performance. but again, it depends what you expect. Do you need it to be pushing 50+ tok/s. You might, if you get the cards and then realise you do, you will feel like it is a let down.  \n\nIf you go for older MI50 AMD cards, you get a lot of VRAM for your money (if you can find 32GB variants), but you pay with set up time and compatability instead. \n\nI think if I were you. I would start off with one of the better e5 v4 xeons on a dual socket lga2011-3 board, probably look for 2699 or if too expensive, 2698 v4. buy 4x32GB RAM, and buy one 3090. Use it, push the limits and then you will know if you need more throughput or more vram. Once you know what you actually need, you can choose what to change\n\n you can probably sell the 3090 for what you bought it for if you decide you want to build around a different card.\n\nYou can add more ram, most dual socket boards have 12 or 16 dimm slots.\n\nyou can add more 3090s if one was good but you want more vram (try and get a board with plenty of x16 pcie slots)\n\nOr if the cpu/platforn is the limitation, you didn't lose too much after you sell the board and cpus, and you can weigh up costs for a newer platform (considerably more)\n\nThis leaves as many options open whilst allowing you to play with a fast gpu with 24GB VRAM and good compatability, and 128GB of RAM. \n\nYou should be able to build that for 1k (just about) and use the other 1k if and when you know what you need.",

          "text": "Start by getting your hands on a decent computer. At the cash you have, you're probably looking used. I assume you already have a PC laying around that was built in the last 5 or so years with a modern processor and 32gb-64gb ddr3/ddr4/ddr5 in it. If so, that's the EASIEST way to get going. Just go buy a 3090/4090 or a 5090, shove it in, and you're done.\n\nIf not, you can buy one fairly cheap prebuilt computer secondhand. Go after something from the more modern intel or AMD lineups. Aim for a HIGHER END cpu built some time this decade (2020 or newer if possible) with as many cores/highest speed you can find. You can go on places like facebook marketplace and find people selling entire used rigs that would work fine. Aim for the best processor/most ram you can find, and try to stick DDR4 or DDR5 if you can (as an example I recently purchased a whole 5900x rig with a 165hz monitor, 3080ti, and 64gb of ddr4 for less than $500 all-in off FB marketplace).\n\nAfter you get the machine, the focus needs to be on the GPU. Hopefully the rig already has one that is useful, but if it DOESN'T have a 3090/4090/5090, thats where you need to dump the rest of your budget. Grab a used 3090/4090, or save up for a 5090.\n\nThat's about as far as you can reasonably go on a budget, while still allowing you to play with some of the best performing models. 24gb vram gets you high speed 30b moe models, lightning-fast smaller models like oss 20b or the smaller 8b and 4b options, high speed image and video generation (ltx-2 fits in 24gb), and plenty of support for your explorations (3090 and newer are gold standards of AI right now, and are likely to maintain strong support for years). Anything cheaper is going to be significantly slower, older, barely supported, and really not a great option. You'll see people in here strapping together impressive server rigs using old cast off server parts that can run big boy MoE models, and that's cool, but unless you have a damn good reason to do that and an exhaustive understanding of server hardware, I'd avoid that space. Older server rigs end up too slow to be worth it for most uses, and newer server rigs are too expensive for your budget.\n\nAnything more capable than what I mentioned is going to be significantly more expensive. Obscenely more expensive in some instances. At that point, you're just flat out better off using API inference and paying pennies for tokens.\n\nOne dark horse here is a AI Max 395x 128gb rig. They're small, sip power, and have unified 128gb ram which allows you to run hefty models like 200b style models at usable speed. That said, 'usable' is still SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER than what you'll get off a good GPU, and those AI max rigs are over 2k USD now. Not a terrible option if you want a quiet little box to experiment with though. Same goes for the newer macbook pro line. They're pricey, but if you grab one with enough unified memory you can run something as big as deepseek at a speed that could still be considered usable. These might not be the cheapest options today, but as time passes and more of these kinds of rigs hit the used market, they're going to end up being pretty solid AI hardware to snatch up.",

On the MBP m2 download vm fusion install Linux (mint, tumbleweed etc) and on the Linux machine install clickhouse and grafana) connect the lm studio llm to the clickhouse vm via an mcp server and your laughing. You could probably even use docker instead of the Linux vm as well. Also have a look at librechat . All of those applications are open source and free. I’d then start saving my money as the next jump is likely expensive and my guess would be an MBP m5 max, a tricked out Mac mini or a Mac Studio  when they come out or a substantially more expensive desktop. \n\nThe above isn’t as much fun as building a new machine but for your budget I’m not sure that the new machine would have much on the MBP m3, the apple silicon is very good. Especially with the current ram and gpu prices.\n\nAlso don’t let it put you off as the small models with the right configuration and actually be really good. You can set it up so you have specialist agents with system prompts that focuses them and the set up MoA architectures on the same model.\n\nGood luck :-)",

When I grow up someday, I want to blow an absurd amount on a peak laptop for LLM performance (buy one, cry once). Outside of having a sweet gaming rig, I work in IT consulting and need a powerful rig for client demos in the future.\n\nI’m trying to decide between two *portable* setups:\n\n* **MacBook Pro (M-series Max, e.g. M4 Max)**: Looking for 128–192 GB unified memory\n* **Windows/Linux laptop w/ RTX 5090 (24GB VRAM)**: At minimum 64 GB system RAM\n\n**Primary use case:**\n\n* Local LLM **inference** (RAG, long context, offline use)\n* Targeting **≥15 tokens/sec** sustained\n* Portability matters (I don't want to carry an extra tower, monitor, and keyboard/mouse with me)\n\n**Secondary / future use case:**\n\n* Fine-tuning (likely LoRA / QLoRA, not full pretraining). I am not super knowledgeable in this space, but I did manage to fine-tune something with Unsloth\n   * My LLM created garbage output. I want to get better at it eventually.\n\nThings I’m specifically curious about from people with hands-on experience:\n\n* For **inference**, does the larger unified memory on Apple Silicon meaningfully outweigh the raw CUDA performance of the RTX laptop?\n   * 70B\n   * 120B\n   * Even more beyond that\n* How painful (or not) is **Apple MLX** today for fine-tuning?\n   * Is it a real blocker, or just more limited / immature vs CUDA?\n* Thermals & sustained performance on long inference runs for both setups\n   * Will it generally be okay for inference (or will I be able to cook an egg with it)?\n\nI’m not expecting a perfect answer — just trying to sanity-check what’s *actually usable day-to-day* versus theoretical specs.\n\nAppreciate any firsthand data or strong opinions from experience!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/89vod4c6uqfg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a959dd0a935e0fc330b369edc69fc8804913e134",

The M4 Max is 546GB/s which blows the doors off any dual-channel DDR5 setup.\n\n**The only time the RTX 5090 will be better is when you’re running small models that fit entirely within VRAM.** As soon as you spill over to RAM, the MacBook eats it for breakfast.",
