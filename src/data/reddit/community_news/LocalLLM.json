Thanks for helping the rest of us in the struggle to keep up!\n\nI'll be more focused one these types of projects when they eventually fire me because they don't realize how much we have to correct the AI still but I wish I had time to be consistent working on some joint projects like this. I'm trying to figure out how to piece together things like roo code with something like vibe kanban and MCPs in an opinionated way to reduce the manual burden while allowing more than coding using local LLMs and then here goes Anthropic with their cowork thing lol\n\nKeep up the hard work!

So permissions end up living either:\n\n* inside prompts (brittle),\n* inside per-tool wrappers (boilerplate explosion),\n* or at the MCP server boundary (coarse, hard to reason about).\n\nThe isolation vs over-permission tradeoff you mention is exactly what happens when there’s no **deny-by-default execution layer** sitting *between* the model and the tools.\n\nWhat’s worked best for us locally is:\n\n* keep MCP servers dumb (pure capability exposure)\n* move auth, cost limits, logging, and allow/deny decisions into a single runtime gate\n* treat every tool call as an auditable event, not “just another function call”\n\nThat way you’re not re-implementing auth + logging per connector, and you’re not trusting the model to behave just because the prompt says so.\n\nI agree it *should* be more native / standardized. Until there’s a real spec for agent execution (not just tool schemas), everyone’s either rolling wrappers or accepting scary permissions.\n\nCurious what level you’re aiming for locally:\n\n* human-in-the-loop approvals?\n* strict allowlists?\n* cost / rate enforcement?\n* or just “don’t nuke my data”?\n\nThat choice seems to drive everything else.",

      "text": "**The Case for a $600 Local LLM Machine**\n\nUsing the Base Model Mac mini M4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5c916gwucoeg1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d91da71f6244d752e15922e47dfbf9d792beb1\n\nby Tony Thomas\n\nIt started as a simple experiment. How much real work could I do on a small, inexpensive machine running language models locally?\n\nWith GPU prices still elevated, memory costs climbing, SSD prices rising instead of falling, power costs steadily increasing, and cloud subscriptions adding up, it felt like a question worth answering. After a lot of thought and testing, the system I landed on was a base model Mac mini M4 with 16 GB of unified memory, a 256 GB internal SSD, a USB-C dock, and a 1 TB external NVMe drive for model storage. Thanks to recent sales, the all-in cost came in right around $600.\n\nOn paper, that does not sound like much. In practice, it turned out to be far more capable than I expected.\n\nLocal LLM work has shifted over the last couple of years. Models are more efficient due to better training and optimization. Quantization is better understood. Inference engines are faster and more stable. At the same time, the hardware market has moved in the opposite direction. GPUs with meaningful amounts of VRAM are expensive, and large VRAM models are quietly disappearing. DRAM is no longer cheap. SSD and NVMe prices have climbed sharply.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, a compact system with tightly integrated silicon starts to look less like a compromise and more like a sensible baseline.\n\n**Why the Mac mini M4 Works**\n\nThe M4 Mac mini stands out because Apple’s unified memory architecture fundamentally changes how a small system behaves under inference workloads. CPU and GPU draw from the same high-bandwidth memory pool, avoiding the awkward juggling act that defines entry-level discrete GPU setups. I am not interested in cramming models into a narrow VRAM window while system memory sits idle. The M4 simply uses what it has efficiently.\n\nSixteen gigabytes is not generous, but it is workable when that memory is fast and shared. For the kinds of tasks I care about, brainstorming, writing, editing, summarization, research, and outlining, it holds up well. I spend my time working, not managing resources.\n\nThe 256 GB internal SSD is limited, but not a dealbreaker. Models and data live on the external NVMe drive, which is fast enough that it does not slow my workflow. The internal disk handles macOS and applications, and that is all it needs to do. Avoiding Apple’s storage upgrade pricing was an easy decision.\n\nThe setup itself is straightforward. No unsupported hardware. No hacks. No fragile dependencies. It is dependable, UNIX-based, and boring in the best way. That matters if you intend to use the machine every day rather than treat it as a side project.\n\n**What Daily Use Looks Like**\n\nThe real test was whether the machine stayed out of my way.\n\nQuantized 7B and 8B models run smoothly using Ollama and LM Studio. AnythingLLM works well too and adds vector databases and seamless access to cloud models when needed. Response times are short enough that interaction feels conversational rather than mechanical. I can draft, revise, and iterate without waiting on the system, which makes local use genuinely viable.\n\nLarger 13B to 14B models are more usable than I expected when configured sensibly. Context size needs to be managed, but that is true even on far more expensive systems. For single-user workflows, the experience is consistent and predictable.\n\nWhat stood out most was how quickly the hardware stopped being the limiting factor. Once the models were loaded and tools configured, I forgot I was using a constrained system. That is the point where performance stops being theoretical and starts being practical.\n\nIn daily use, I rotate through a familiar mix of models. Qwen variants from 1.7B up through 14B do most of the work, alongside Mistral instruct models, DeepSeek 8B, Phi-4, and Gemma. On this machine, smaller Qwen models routinely exceed 30 tokens per second and often land closer to 40 TPS depending on quantization and context. These smaller models can usually take advantage of the full available context without issue.\n\nThe 7B to 8B class typically runs in the low to mid 20s at context sizes between 4K and 16K. Larger 13B to 14B models settle into the low teens at a conservative 4K context and operate near the upper end of acceptable memory pressure. Those numbers are not headline-grabbing, but they are fast enough that writing, editing, and iteration feel fluid rather than constrained. I am rarely waiting on the model, which is the only metric that actually matters for my workflow.\n\n**Cost, Power, and Practicality**\n\nAt roughly $600, this system occupies an important middle ground. It costs less than a capable GPU-based desktop while delivering enough performance to replace a meaningful amount of cloud usage. Over time, that matters more than peak benchmarks.\n\nThe Mac mini M4 is also extremely efficient. It draws very little power under sustained inference loads, runs silently, and requires no special cooling or placement. I routinely leave models running all day without thinking about the electric bill.\n\nThat stands in sharp contrast to my Ryzen 5700G desktop paired with an Intel B50 GPU. That system pulls hundreds of watts under load, with the B50 alone consuming around 50 watts during LLM inference. Over time, that difference is not theoretical. It shows up directly in operating costs.\n\nThe M4 sits on top of my tower system and behaves more like an appliance. Thanks to my use of a KVM, I can turn off the desktop entirely and keep working. I do not think about heat, noise, or power consumption. That simplicity lowers friction and makes local models something I reach for by default, not as an occasional experiment.\n\n**Where the Limits Are**\n\nThe constraints are real but manageable. Memory is finite, and there is no upgrade path. Model selection and context size require discipline. This is an inference-first system, not a training platform.\n\nApple Silicon also brings ecosystem boundaries. If your work depends on CUDA-specific tooling or experimental research code, this is not the right machine. It relies on Apple’s Metal backend rather than NVIDIA’s stack. My focus is writing and knowledge work, and for that, the platform fits extremely well.\n\n**Why This Feels Like a Turning Point**\n\nWhat surprised me was not that the Mac mini M4 could run local LLMs. It was how well it could run them given the constraints.\n\nFor years, local AI was framed as something that required large amounts of RAM, a powerful CPU, and an expensive GPU. These systems were loud, hot, and power hungry, built primarily for enthusiasts. This setup points in a different direction. With efficient models and tightly integrated hardware, a small, affordable system can do real work.\n\nFor writers, researchers, and independent developers who care about control, privacy, and predictable costs, a budget local LLM machine built around the Mac mini M4 no longer feels experimental. It is something I turn on in the morning, leave running all day, and rely on without thinking about the hardware.\n\nMore than any benchmark, that is what matters.\n\nFrom: tonythomas-dot-net",

These work really well with the LM Studio software.\n\nMy system is Ryzen 5 2400 with W11. 32 GB DDR4 RAM, a Crucial 2,5\" SSD (240 GB) and a AMD R580 GPU...with 16 GB of VRAM on it. So, 'simple' and 'weak-sauce' would be apt descriptions of this system. And yet, those LFM models work very well in here. Even if it is via Vulkan.\n\nedit:  \nIf you use LM Studio, it comes with MCP support, so these small models can now also look on the internet, can keep track of time and a few other things I find handy. Is very easy to set up and your local LLM becomes much more useful (if you trust information on the internet of course).",

I use it when I want to run models with bigger context windows, and also larger models (mostly MoE) like OSS 20B, Mistral Small 24B, Qwen 30B, Nemotron 30B, GLM 4.7 Flash 30B, etc.\n\nIf you are a professional coder, not even a Mac Studio 512GB can compare to enterprise GPUs:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxDe1j\\_IcSQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxDe1j_IcSQ)",

      "text": "Text wall warning :)\n\nI tried Clawdbot (before the name switch so I am going to keep using it) on a dedicated VPS and then a Raspberry Pi, both considered disposable instances with zero sensitive data. So I can say as a real user: The experience is awesome, but the project is terrible. The entire thing is very \\*very\\* vibe-coded and you can smell the code without even looking at it... \n\nI don't know how to describe it, but several giveaways are multiple instances of the same information (for example, model information is stored in both \\~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json and \\~/.clawdbot/agents/main/agent/models.json. Same for authentication profiles), the /model command will allow you to select a invalid model (for example, I once entered anthropic/kimi-k2-0905-preview by accident and it just added that to the available model list and selected it. For those who don't know, Anthropic has their own Claude models and certainly doesn't host Moonshot's Kimi), and unless you run a good model (aka Claude Opus or Sonnet), it's going to break from time to time. \n\nI would not be surprised if this thing has 1000 CVEs in it. Yet judging by the speed of development, by the time those CVEs are discovered, the code base would have been refactored twice over, so that's security, I guess? (For reddit purposes this is a joke and security doesn't work that way and asking AI to refactor the code base doesn't magically remove vulnerabilities.)\n\nBy the way, did I mention it also burns tokens like a jet engine? I set up the thing and let it run for a while, and it cost me 8 MILLION TOKENS, on Claude-4.5-OPUS, the most expensive model I have ever paid for! But, on the flip side: I had NEVER set up any agentic workflow before. No LangChain, no MCP, nothing. Remember those 8 million tokens? With those tokens Claude \\*set itself up\\* and only asked for minimal information (such as API Keys) when necessary. Clawdbot is like an Apple product: when it runs it's like MAGIC, until it doesn't (for example, when you try to hook it up to kimi-k2-0905-preview non thinking, not even 1T parameters can handle this, thinking is a requirement).\n\nAlso, I am sure part of why smaller models don't work so well is probably due to how convoluted the command-line UI is, and how much it focuses on eyecandy instead of detailed information. So when it's the AI's turn to use it... Well it requires a big brain. I'm honestly shocked after looking at the architecture (which it seems to have none) that Claude Opus is able to set itself up.\n\nFinally, jokes and criticisms aside, using Clawdbot is the first time since the beginning of LLM that I genuinly feel like I'm talking to J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man.",

Token burn is also real once you let an agent loop on tool calls.\n\nOne thing thats helped me is adding hard budgets (max steps, max tool calls, max tokens) plus logging every tool invocation so you can spot where it starts thrashing. Also, forcing the agent to write a short plan before execution cuts down on the random wandering.\n\nIf youre collecting notes on what patterns actually make these setups stable, I bookmarked a few practical breakdowns here: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/",

For example i even have a ssh tool that’s used just to ssh into stuff and only investigate, its made me be able to copy paste my clients email and just have it investigate.\n\nThe command line UI is fine. I hookd up mirothinker v1.5 30b a3b and because its just simple tool calls, once its setup literally a frequent gen 30b model can handle it. The .md has OR SHOULD HAVE all usage steps for all ur models to be able to have proper syntax to use tools etc. if you’re not setting this up properly to work, it is on you for not being resourceful enough to think things through.",

          "text": "You might enjoy this paper from 2024;\n\n> Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically improved their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often limit models to making only one attempt at a problem. Here, we explore inference compute as another axis for scaling, using the simple technique of repeatedly sampling candidate solutions from a model. Across multiple tasks and models, we observe that coverage -- the fraction of problems that are solved by any generated sample -- scales with the number of samples over four orders of magnitude. Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the number of samples is often log-linear and can be modelled with an exponentiated power law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. In domains like coding and formal proofs, where answers can be automatically verified, these increases in coverage directly translate into improved performance. When we apply repeated sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples, outperforming the single-sample state-of-the-art of 43%. In domains without automatic verifiers, we find that common methods for picking from a sample collection (majority voting and reward models) plateau beyond several hundred samples and fail to fully scale with the sample budget. \n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21787",

Their recommended mitigation is to be specific and concise and avoid vague prompts that trigger extra clarification cycles.\n\n  \nA practical workflow pattern that aligns with that  \n• Convert “make this change” into a single narrowly defined task  \n• Provide only the minimal relevant snippets, not the whole repo  \n• Constrain edits to a file list  \n• Require diff output  \n• Plan first, then implement step 1\n\n  \nIt reduces the chance of large refactors and keeps each turn cheaper. \n\nHope this helps!

Since it's tiny, you can run it on your laptop with complete data privacy.\n\nSmall models struggle with multi-turn tool calling - out of the box, Qwen3-0.6B achieves 84% accuracy on single tool calls, which drops to **just 42% over 5 turns.** Our tuning brings this to 100% on the test set, delivering robust multi-turn performance.\n\n|Model|Parameters|Tool call accuracy (test set)|=> 5-turn tool call accuracy|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Qwen3 235B Instruct (teacher)|235B|99%|95%|\n|Qwen3 0.6B (base)|0.6B|84%|42%|\n|**Qwen3 0.6B (tuned)**|**0.6B**|**100%**|**100%**|\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/distil-labs/distil-SHELLper](https://github.com/distil-labs/distil-SHELLper)\n\nHuggingface model: [https://huggingface.co/distil-labs/distil-qwen3-0.6b-SHELLper](https://huggingface.co/distil-labs/distil-qwen3-0.6b-SHELLper)\n\n# Quick Start\n\nSet up the environment:\n\n    # Set up environment\n    python -m venv .venv\n    . .venv/bin/activate\n    pip install openai huggingface_hub\n    \n\nDowload the model:\n\n    hf download distil-labs/distil-qwen3-0.6b-SHELLper --local-dir distil_model\n    cd distil_model\n    ollama create distil_model -f Modelfile\n    cd ..\n    \n\nRun the assistant:\n\n    python filesystem_demo.py\n    \n\nThe demo prompts for confirmation before running commands (safety first) and blocks certain dangerous operations (like `rm -r /`), so feel free to try it out!\n\n# How We Trained SHELLper\n\n# The Problem\n\nSmall models really struggle with multi-turn tool calling - performance degrades as tool calls chain together, dropping with each additional turn. If we assume independent errors for each tool call (like incorrect parameter values), a model at 80% accuracy only has a 33% chance of getting through 5 turns error-free.\n\n|Single tool call accuracy|5-turn tool call accuracy|\n|:-|:-|\n|80%|33%|\n|90%|59%|\n|95%|77%|\n|99%|95%|\n\nFor this demo, we wanted to test if we could dramatically improve a small model's multi-turn performance. We started with a task from the [Berkeley function calling leaderboard](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.html) (BFCL) - the [gorilla file system tool calling task](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/blob/main/berkeley-function-call-leaderboard/bfcl_eval/data/BFCL_v4_multi_turn_base.json). We adapted it:\n\n* Original task supports multiple tool calls per turn → we restrict to one\n* Cap at 5 turns max\n* Map commands to actual bash (instead of gorilla filesystem functions)\n* Skip adding tool outputs to conversation history\n\nBasically, the same tool set, but new, simpler [train/test data.](https://github.com/distil-labs/distil-SHELLper/tree/main/data)\n\n# Training Pipeline\n\n1. **Seed Data:** We built 20 simplified training conversations covering the available tools in realistic scenarios.\n2. **Synthetic Expansion:** Using our [data synthesis pipeline](https://www.distillabs.ai/blog/small-expert-agents-from-10-examples/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=shellper), we generated thousands of training examples.\n\nSince we're dealing with variable-length conversations, we broke each conversation into intermediate steps. Example:\n\n    [Input] User: List all files => Model: ls -al => User: go to directory models\n    [Output] Model: cd models\n    \n\n... becomes 2 training points:\n\n    [Input] User: List all files\n    [Output] Model: ls -al\n    \n\n    [Input] User: List all files => Model: ls -al => User: go to directory models\n    [Output] Model: cd models`\n    \n\n1. **Fine-tuning:** We selected **Qwen3-0.6B** as the [most fine-tunable sub-1B](https://www.distillabs.ai/blog/we-benchmarked-12-small-language-models-across-8-tasks-to-find-the-best-base-model-for-fine-tuning) model with tool calling support on our platform.\n\n# Usage Examples\n\nThe assistant interprets natural language, generates bash commands, and can execute them (with Y/N confirmation).\n\n**Basic filesystem operations**\n\n    > python filesystem_demo.py\n    \n    USER: List all files in the current directory\n    COMMAND: ls\n    USER: Create a new directory called test_folder\n    COMMAND: mkdir test_folder\n    USER: Navigate to test_folder COMMAND: cd test_folder\n    \n\n# Limitations and Next Steps\n\nCurrently, we only support a basic bash tool set:\n\n* no pipes, chained commands, or multiple tool calls per turn\n* no detection of invalid commands/parameters\n* 5-turn conversation limit\n\nWe wanted to focus on the basic case before tackling complexity. Next up: multiple tool calls to enable richer agent workflows, plus benchmarking against [BFCL](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.html).\n\nFor your own bash workflows, you can log failing commands, add them to `data/train.jsonl`, and retrain with the updated data (or try a bigger student model!).\n\n# Discussion\n\nWould love to hear from the community:\n\n* Is anyone else fine-tuning small models for multi-turn tool calling?\n* What other \"focused but practical\" tasks need local, privacy-first models?",

Some key bits:\n\n> The documentation for HashIndex identifies it as a \"vectorless\" index system. This characterization is central to its \"under the hood\" operations. Instead of calculating a mathematical hash or a vector embedding, the system invokes an LLM to generate what it terms a \"semantic hash key\".  \n\n> When a document is ingested by HashIndex, it is first split into segments or pages. For each segment, the system initiates a dual-process LLM call. The first process involves generating a highly descriptive, human-readable label that encapsulates the core theme of the content. This label—for example, ``revenue_projections_FY2024_Q3``—serves as the index key in the hash map. The second process generates a concise summary of the page.\n\n> This \"single-pass\" parsing allows the document to be structured for retrieval without the need for pre-computed embedding datasets. However, the cost of this precision is time. While a traditional cryptographic hash function $H(x)$ or an embedding model can process data in milliseconds, the semantic key generation in HashIndex requires significant inference time, typically 2 to 3 seconds per page.\n\n[...]\n\n> In HashIndex, the hash table is implemented in-memory, allowing for rapid access once the indexing phase is complete. The \"hash function\" in this context is the cognitive process performed by the LLM during key generation. This approach eliminates the need for complex tree rebalancing and multi-level traversal required by systems like ChatIndex or PageIndex. However, it places a higher burden on the \"agentic\" side of the retrieval process, as the agent must now navigate a flat list of keys rather than a hierarchical tree. \n\nDoes this look like an accurate summary of how it works? Might be worth calling out that the \"hash\" in this case is not a traditional hash in the way that word is usually meant, but an LLM-generated semantic \"tag\" of sorts.",

Voice assist can do pretty much what you want and in the case that you have unique requests, you can just add those by hand. Even the personality part can be creating using custom answers. The only downside is that it can only do what you program it to do and you will not be able to have conversations with it. If you need conversations, then you will certainly need a model but you don't need a 13b to do what you want. You do not even need a GPU as long as you have a good CPU and fast ram and enough ram to load the model. \n\nSince I do not know your hardware specs, I recommend you starting with [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF?show\\_file\\_info=Qwen3-4B-Q4\\_K\\_M.gguf](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF?show_file_info=Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf)\n\nYou can run that on CPU and get really good speed depending on your hardware.

For this purpose , you do not need to buy a stupid expensive card. 60 bucks will do better job than any 3060, 4060 and 5060 for this particular application and use case.\n\nwith one P102-100, you can run Piper, Whisper and Qwen 4b and get everything you wanted to do.\n\nnow, if you really want to go nuts, you can get two and then you can run Qwen30b and get these speeds.\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | ggml_cuda_init: found 2 CUDA devices:`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  |   Device 0: NVIDIA P102-100, compute capability 6.1, VMM: yes`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  |   Device 1: NVIDIA P102-100, compute capability 6.1, VMM: yes`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | load_backend: loaded CUDA backend from /app/libggml-cuda.so`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | load_backend: loaded CPU backend from /app/libggml-cpu-piledriver.so`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | | model                          |       size |     params | backend    | ngl | fa |            test |                  t/s |`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | | ------------------------------ | ---------: | ---------: | ---------- | --: | -: | --------------: | -------------------: |`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | | qwen3moe 30B.A3B IQ4_NL - 4.5 bpw |  16.12 GiB |    30.53 B | CUDA       |  99 |  1 |           pp512 |        968.28 ± 4.69 |`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | | qwen3moe 30B.A3B IQ4_NL - 4.5 bpw |  16.12 GiB |    30.53 B | CUDA       |  99 |  1 |           tg128 |         72.10 ± 0.23 |`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1  |` \n\n`llamacpp-server-1  | build: 557515be1 (7819)`\n\n`llamacpp-server-1 exited with code 0`\n\n  \nabout 1,000 in prompt processing and 70+ tokens generation.\n\ntrust me, for home assistant, you will not need more than that and at that price, you will not find a better solution.\n\nAsk people that actually own P102-100, don''t take my word for it.\n\nFor this use case.... this is it.",

Now you need the Speech to text (STT)  and Text to Speech(TTS) in addition to a LLM.  Both the TTS and STT need VRAM, but there are TTS like Piper than can actually run on the CPU.\n\nOne nice thing here is most voice assistants don't do a lot of context so you only need say 15% more VRAM than the LLM.\n\nYou will need to experiment to find what works for you.  Put a few bucks into OpenRouter and try the models.  A possible example would be mistral 3 8B which fits in about 7GB of VRAM.  They free models too.   Find what will work for what you want.\n\nIf I ever get some time, I plan on doing what you are trying to do.  My plan is to use a Wyse 5070 and a $50 10GB VRAM P102-100 GPU.  Not sure if I can get a smart enough model STT and TTS , but I want to try.  That setup will idle around 10 watts.  I may consider picking up a 24GB P40 as it also is pretty low idle power.   The P40 is around $200 after the needed fan to cool it.\n\nMy power is crazy expensive so cheap 16 GB GPUs like the P100 or CMP100-210 idle at 40 or 50 watts.  That is like $200/yr for me.\n\nAnyway, before dropping coin on a GPU, test out a solution with available tools like Openrouter and Huggingface.  For a project like this $10 can go a long way for testing.",

It works fantastic...\n\non the P102-100 with those models and that mic, your response time from HA after your command should be in the milliseconds. Not even a second like half a second or less, extremely responsive, that is unless you are running it in an under powered device.\n\nI run this setup flawlessly.",

              "text": "I actually tend to use a Qwen3 30B A3B Instruct model in ~2-4bit. I tried it with Q2_K in GGUF format with KoboldAI, needs with a small KV Cache around 12GB VRAM (Q4 would be around 16-18GB VRAM) and I was surprised how good it still is, but even more surprised how crazy fast it is (at least on my RTX 4090). Thanks to its MoE pipeline, where only 3B of the model is active, so it is mostly as fast as a 3B model at Q2_K would be, but of cause way better, you don't need to try a 3B at Q2_K, it will be very very bad but crazy fast. It's hard for me to use dense models now, they are so slow in comparison.\n\nSo as long you don't want to have a realtime conversation with the LLM, you can also split a some layers of the model into normal RAM. It slows down the model a bit but if you only put ~10% of the model in RAM it should stay fast enough so you can bring down the SmartHome reaction to maybe 5 seconds or lower. The only question is if you need tool calling, that could break on Q2_K, but there are ways to work around that.\n\nBut I would go for a solid 16GB VRAM card (RTX 40xx/50xx series), not too much on the low end, then you can put the LLM completely into the VRAM. So maybe a 5070TI with 16GB VRAM. No clue if a 5060TI is still fast enough. I \"only\" have a 4090 and a 5080. Could be if you get the full model into VRAM, because if not, the 5060TI has only PCIe 5 8x, the 5070TI has PCIe 5 16x, but that is only really relevant if you use offloading (splitting the model into RAM) or if the GPU is in a PCIe 5 x16 slot. If you need offloading, better don't put a PCIe 5 8x GPU into a PCIe 5 motherboard setup.\n\nBut beside that, it really depends what you want to exactly do. If you only want the bar minimum, for example only some different phrases that should react for one SmartHome function, you can do that with much much less hardware and a tiny AI model that only recognize what you want to do. Such an AI didn't need to be that smart at all, only always recognize what you want from it, you can even give it a bit the illusion of personality. But if your plan is to build your SmartHome more and more out, then a LLM is surely not a bad decision, but a more costly one.",
