      "text": "After 3 weeks of deep work, I''ve realized agents are so un predictable that are basically useless for any professional use. This is what I've found:\n\nLet's exclude the instructions that must be clear, effective and not ambiguos. Possibly with few shot examples (but not always!)\n\n1) Every model requires a system prompt carefully crafted with instructions styled  as similar as its training set. (Where do you find it? No idea)\nSame prompt with different model causes different results and performances. \nLesson learned: once you find a style that workish, better you stay with that model family.\n\n2) Inference parameters: that's is pure alchemy. time consuming of trial and error. (If you change model,  be ready to start all over again). No comment on this.\n\n3) system prompt  length: if you are too descriptive at best you inject a strong bias in the agent, at worst the model just forget some parts of it.\nIf you are too short model hallucinates.\nGood luck in finding the sweet spot, and still, you cross the fingers every time you run the agent. \nThis connect me to the next point...\n\n4) dense or MOE model? \nDense model are much better in keeping context (especially system instructions), but they are slow.\nMoE are fast, but during the experts activation not always the context is passed correctly among them. The \"not always\" makes me crazy.\nSo again you get different responses  based on I don't know what.! Pretty sure that are some obscure parameters as well...\nHope Qwen next will fix this.\n\n5) RAG and KGraphs? Fascinating but that's another field of science. Another deeeepp rabbit hole I don't even want to talk about now.\n\n6) Text to SQL?  You have to pray, a lot. Either you end up manually coding the commands and give it as tool, or be ready for disaster. And that is a BIG pity, since DB are very much used in any business.( Yeah yeah. Table description data types etc...already tried) \n\n7) you want reliability? Then go for structured input and output! Atomicity of tasks!\nI got to the point that between the problem decomposition to a level that the agent can manage it (reliably) and the construction of a structured input/output chain, the level of effort required makes me wonder what is this hype about AI? Or at least home AI.  (and I have a Ryzen AI max 395).\n\n\nAnd still after all the efforts you always have this feeling: will it work this time? \nAgentic shit is far far away from YouTube demos and frameworks examples.\nSome people creates Frankenstein systems, where even naming the combination they are using is too long,.but hey it works!! Question is \"for how long\"? \nWhat's gonna be deprecated or updated on the next version of one of your parts?\n\nWhat I've learned is that if you want to make something professional and reliable, (especially if you are being paid for it) better to use good old deterministic code, and as less dependencies as possible. Put here and there some LLM calls for those task where NLP is necessary because coding all conditions would take forever.\n\nNonetheless I do  believe, that in the end, the magical equilibrium of all parameters and prompts and shit must exist. And while I search for that sweet spot, I hope that local models will keep improving and making our life way simpler.\n\nJust for the curious: I've tried every possible model until gpt OSS 120b, Framework AGNO. Inference with LMstudio and Ollama (I'm on Windows, no vllm).\n\n \n\n\n\n",

The project can never move forward without high risk of capital and doing the whole pizza store thing and just opening up with the supplies you think are right.\n\nFor the LLM, it means you have to throw heavy hardware or high capital, lots of time, and lots of tests into something that might never be profitable for business or affordable for home hobbies.\n\nYou don't know until you add up the unpredictable costs while you tested and played with prompts for a week to a year.

          "text": "YES. #4 and #5, plus 1, 2, and 3. You did a lot of thinking on this and are correct.\n\nMy comment is this on the latter part. Your prediction of the future is sound. There will be so many iterations of AI improvements, PC hardware improvements, and refinements in the interface that the LLM of 2036 will be nothing like an LLM of 2026. Early adopters have so many disadvantages.\n\nThis stuff will be cheaper and faster in ten years. At current tech level and my current interest level, I think an adequate system, for just my personal use (With an eye to selling it), would cost $500 to $2000 per month and would need a new Internet connection. The current software may seem bloated when you download it, but the interfaces of today are simply a kludge and a Jack-of-all-trades that does nothing right except maybe answer chat questions a 6th grader might ask.\n\nAsk a current LLM about a dataset, and you're going to get terrible results. Even commercial systems stink. All you have to do is call into a Big Company and ask for tech support. The human agents are typing things into an AI, you can tell, and trying to bring up internal PDFs to answer your question and walk you through a solution.\n\nBecause their innate human knowledge is practically nil. They read from a script like phone agents have done for 40 years, but they are reading from hallucinated AI slop or the wrong PDF that's from 4 versions earlier that do not apply. LLMs have not taught Tier 1 support personnel how to think, and they certainly haven't trained them on the specifics of the things they are supporting.\n\nIf Fortune 100 companies can't figure out how to get AI to work to help their customers at Tier 1 (and their bottom line making money), I find it ridiculous to assume that a one-man-shop could figure it out.\n\nI wish all of you programmers, content creators, and schoolkids doing homework all the best! For the rest of us, it's hard to go full-in to this mess, for all of the reasons OP stated, starting at #1 and on down the list.\n\nBravo.",

It works fine for simple tasks and tool calls, but as soon as it gets slightly more complex, it's not even worth the effort to write the prompt and wait for its output, it's quicker to just code it myself. \n\nThat said, I also think LLM's are still in their infancy, and there is so much we have yet to discover about them. For example for my use-case as a programmer, I see a lot of potential in spec-driven development, where a task is broken down into tiny subtasks that can then each be implemented and tested, and not be too complex for a local LLM to achieve. But how to formulate those specs? How does the workflow look like? I don't know.\n\nAnd that's maybe another issue - so many of the AI integrators (like IDE chat plugins) expect to talk to a frontier model like Claude Sonnet, Gemini or GPT. But when I plug them into a smaller model, they shouldn't just use the exact same prompts, but more specialized ones, and I fear there's just not enough interest in the community in perfecting this.",

A master woodworker will be far more proficient with a hammer then Joe Smoe that just picked up a hammer from Harborfreight for the first time ever. Different tools, different skill sets.\n\nb.) Right tool for the job. For some jobs these tools are either the wrong tools or just not worth the time/cost. Just as it's sometimes just faster to do something yourself then explain to someone else what you want so they can do it for you.\n\nc.) There can be a huge difference in quality between 'cheap' tools and 'expensive' tools. In this case you're using tiny models locally, even the 120B quantized is not going to compare well to the big unquantized models. For SQL see: [https://llm-benchmark.tinybird.live/](https://llm-benchmark.tinybird.live/)\n\nd.) You need to know the answer, always with LLM. If you don't, you're in for a world of hurt in a professional production environment. And SQL queries in a production environment seem to *me* like probably the worst possible use of LLM.\n\ne.) People need to realize that at what point are you spending more time=money on LLM then actually making your work more efficient?\n\nSidenote: I have not yet used LLM in my professional capacity. Primary reason is that I tend to work on the edge of IT deployment, and the LLMs haven't been trained yet on the use cases I'm working on and the edge cases that are very rare. Not to mention that even IF the LLM is trained on the 'promotional' material, the reason I'm doing my thing is to see if what's been sold to the client actually works as the sales people say it does (and it often does not)... The other reason is that the companies/clients I work for either do not allow LLM or have not yet onboarded it. And when I work for a client, I only use what they have allowed.\n\nPersonally I've tested quite a bit on a Mac Mini M4 Pro 64GB with models up to 70b, mostly for hobby projects. The results from there is that while very cool and the DS 70b model was better then the far larger GPT from less then a year before, still the unquantized far larger models we can't run locally did far, far better. And due to it being for my hobby projects, I saw no security concerns to *not* use the larger models (for free) on the web. Even the DS 671b model *quantized* on a $10k Mac Studio M3 Ultra 512GB gave worse quality responses then the full unquantized free model you could use on the Internet. Spending $50k on a Mac Studio cluster would be cool, but imho highly inefficient.",

      "text": "2025 felt like three AI years compressed into one. Frontier LLMs went insane on reasoning, open‑source finally became “good enough” for a ton of real workloads, OCR and VLMs leveled up, and audio models quietly made agents actually usable in the real world. ​ Here’s a category‑wise recap of the “best of 2025” models that actually changed how people build stuff, not just leaderboard screenshots:\n\n\n\nLLMs and reasoning\n\n\\* GPT‑5.2 (Thinking / Pro) – Frontier‑tier reasoning and coding, very fast inference, strong for long‑horizon tool‑using agents and complex workflows.\n\n​\\* Gemini 3 Pro / Deep Think – Multi‑million token context and multimodal “screen reasoning”; excels at planning, code, and web‑scale RAG / NotebookLM‑style use cases. \n\n\\* Claude 4.5 (Sonnet / Opus) – Extremely strong for agentic tool use, structured step‑by‑step plans, and “use the computer for me” style tasks. \n\n\\* DeepSeek‑V3.2 & Qwen3‑Thinking – Open‑weight monsters that narrowed the gap with closed models to within \\\\\\~0.3 points on key benchmarks while being orders of magnitude cheaper to run.\n\nIf 2023–24 was “just use GPT,” 2025 finally became “pick an LLM like you pick a database.”\n\nVision, VLMs & OCR\n\n\\* MiniCPM‑V 4.5 – One of the strongest open multimodal models for OCR, charts, documents, and even video frames, tuned to run on mobile/edge while still hitting SOTA‑ish scores on OCRBench/OmniDocBench. \n\n\\* olmOCR‑2‑7B‑1025 – Allen Institute’s OCR‑optimized VLM, fine‑tuned from Qwen2.5‑VL, designed specifically for documents and long‑form OCR pipelines. \n\n\\* InternVL 2.x / 2.5‑4B – Open VLM family that became a go‑to alternative to closed GPT‑4V‑style models for document understanding, scene text, and multimodal reasoning.\n\n\\* Gemma 3 VLM & Qwen 2.5/3 VL lines – Strong open(-ish) options for high‑res visual reasoning, multilingual OCR, and long‑form video understanding in production‑style systems. ​ \n\n2025 might be remembered as the year “PDF to clean Markdown with layout, tables, and charts” stopped feeling like magic and became a boring API call.\n\nAudio, speech & agents\n\n\\* Whisper (still king, but heavily optimized) – Remained the default baseline for multilingual ASR in 2025, with tons of optimized forks and on‑device deployments. \n\n\\* Low‑latency real‑time TTS/ASR stacks (e.g., new streaming TTS models & APIs) – Sub‑second latency + streaming text/audio turned LLMs into actual real‑time voice agents instead of “podcast narrators.” \n\n\\* Many 2025 voice stacks shipped as APIs rather than single models: ASR + LLM + real‑time TTS glued together for call centers, copilots, and vibecoding IDEs. ​ Voice went from “cool demo” to “I talk to my infra/IDE/CRM like a human, and it answers back, live.”\n\nOCR/document AI & IDP\n\n\\* olmOCR‑2‑7B‑1025, MiniCPM‑V 4.5, InternVL 2.x, OCRFlux‑3B, PaddleOCR‑VL – A whole stack of open models that can parse PDFs into structured Markdown with tables, formulas, charts, and long multi‑page layouts. \n\n\\* On top of these, IDP / “PDF AI” tools wrapped them into full products for invoices, contracts, and messy enterprise docs. ​ \n\nIf your 2022 stack was “Tesseract + regex,” 2025 was “drop a 100‑page scan and get usable JSON/Markdown back.” ​ \n\nOpen‑source LLMs that actually mattered\n\n\\* DeepSeek‑V3.x – Aggressive MoE + thinking budgets + brutally low cost; a lot of people quietly moved internal workloads here. \n\n\\* Qwen3 family – Strong open‑weight reasoning, multilingual support, and specialized “Thinking” variants that became default self‑host picks. \n\n\\* Llama 4 & friends – Closed the gap to within \\\\\\~0.3 points of frontier models on several leaderboards, making “fully open infra” a realistic choice for many orgs.\n\n​In 2025, open‑source didn’t fully catch the frontier, but for a lot of teams, it crossed the “good enough + cheap enough” threshold.\n\nYour turn This list is obviously biased toward models that:\n\n\\* Changed how people build products (agents, RAG, document workflows, voice UIs)\n\n\\* Have public benchmarks, APIs, or open weights that normal devs can actually touch ​- What did you ship or adopt in 2025 that deserves “model of the year” status?\n\nFavorite frontier LLM?\n\n\\* Favorite open‑source model you actually self‑hosted?\n\n\\* Best OCR / VLM / speech model that saved you from pain?\n\n\\* Drop your picks below so everyone can benchmark / vibe‑test them going into 2026.",

K2 Thinking works best high RAM rigs or with high GPU count, like twenty MI50 cards (for 640 GB VRAM in total) - I actually considered getting that much since at the time I looked into it, it was possible for half the price of RTX PRO 6000 and my motherboard could carry them all at PCI-E 4.0 x4 speed each, but I decided to stay with 4x3090 for now (because even though full VRAM inference would be faster, my current performance with 1 TB RAM + 96 GB VRAM is still acceptable to me, and a lot of what I do requires Nvidia cards, and not just LLMs either).",

If the ebooks are like current info that can change or become stale you will want to tag them and set up some sort of workflow to compare them to a Gemini or open ai call to compare the info and if it becomes stale remove it. I use qdrant and postgresql for ground truth. I do stuff like this for versions of python that I have to use to stay compatible with other things I'm running. Or actually for langchain and langgraph too. They just changed compatibility versions so whenever I upgrade I can just use the newer repo in my rag with the updated information. I will still keep the old one until I am absolutely certain I won't revert but you can just leave it sit there and not reference the old one. Hope that makes sense.",

Faster than my work laptop with an iGPU (which runs it faster than I can read).\n\nThe model itself is fully open source (data too!) and made by NVIDIA. The performance of the model exceeds other models in the same parameter range of 20-32b and has very long context (up to a million tokens).\n\nNVIDIA worked with Unsloth for day 0 quants of the model. Unsloth makes efficient dynamic quants of models that retain very high levels of accuracy at lower precision.

I've written a script to run a benchmark test and measure speed with all combinations of different context length / % GPU-offload layer / force experts on CPU on vs off.\n\nWith smaller context (i.e. 10k tokens) I get up to 16 TPS. This drops to around 10 @200k tokens. I'm no expert but I don't think there will be a big difference between 5070 or 5080 if VRAM is the same.\n\nWhat i can't understand is that with nemotron it does not matter how much layers I offload to GPU. The model is around 30 GB but only between 4 and 6 GB VRAM is used regardless of offload setting. It seems only the active layers are offloaded to GPU. This was different when I qwen 2.5, where I had to balance the exact number of layers that would fit in VRAM. As soon as you try to offload more layers than fit in VRAM, regular RAM will be used as shared VRAM and TPS drop drastically. \n\nProbably nothing new here for most redditors on this sub but i'm new to local LLM's and had to figure out a lot of things myself.",

I don't pay for these services, so I only use the lesser-capable models.\n\nMy laptop is not powerful enough to run this (no GPU / I've experimented with ollama but I can only run the smallest models very slowly so this is not ok for daily use), so I'm currently considering building a device dedicated to running a LLM, mainly for coding purposes. Ideally something small, Raspberry Pi-based or similar would be great.\n\nI have a few questions: is there specialized hardware for this (I've heard of TPU/NPU)? What kind of performance can I expect (I'd need at least GPT4/Devstral level)? I'm also worried about speed (tokens/s) and cost.\n\n  \nAny advice is appreciated!\n\nCheers!",

It’s an “OpenAPI-compatible” endpoint, so you can use it remotely with any number of frontends that support it.\n\nBy far the most common/popular choice _(and what I use personally)_ is [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) which has a ChatGPT-esque look to it. It’s a lightweight webserver that you can run easily as a docker container.\n\nOnce set up, you can configure Open WebUI to connect to any remote API, such as Anthropic or ChatGPT. In this case you’d point it at your locally hosted LM Studio API.\n\nSince it’s web based, you can use it directly on your phone via web browser, so long as you’re on the same network as your PC.\n\n_Additionally, you could try out [Conduit](https://github.com/cogwheel0/conduit), which is a native mobile app for accessing Open WebUI, and is available on the App Store/Play Store. You’d still need to set up Open WebUI, but IMO the Conduit interface is a bit nicer on my phone than trying to use Open WebUI in a mobile browser. This is very optional though, you can just use it in a browser._",

It would seem that AMD GPUs are priced better than NVIDIA GPUs (and I was even considering some Chinese GPUs). \n\nAs I am reading around, it sounds like NVIDIA has the advantage of CUDA, but I'm not quite sure what this really is and why it is an advantage. For example, can't AMD simply make their chips compatible with CUDA? Or can't they make it so that their chips are also efficient running PyTorch?\n\n\n\nAgain, I'm pretty much a novice in this space, so some of the words I am using I don't even really know what they are and how they relate to others. Is there an ELI5 on this? Like...the RTX 3090 is a GPU (hardware chip). Is CUDA like the firmware that allows the OS to use the GPU to do calculations? And is it that most LLM tools written with CUDA API calls in mind but not AMD's equivalent firmware API calls? Is that what makes it such that AMD is less efficient or poorly supported with LLM applications?\n\n\n\nSorry if the question doesn't make much sense... ",

The issue is OpenAi is using the hundreds of billions of debt they've created to buy half of all ram being made eventhough they don't really have growing demand to match that growth rate anymore and they can't actually build data centers fast enough even if they did have the demand so they are hoarding unused silicon. \n\nThat got their competitors worried so they all started doing the same. The same sillicon makes all sorts of memory and there's only a handful of manufacturers. They all recognize this wont be sustainable so most of them are just increasing pricing rather than increasing their output which would lead to them losing money when the bubble eventually bursts.\n\nI think OpenAI knows there's not sufficient demand but this approach makes it harder for anyone to compete. My customers are worried that they literally can't get GPUs from cloud providers when they try. It would be great if governments recognized the risk to the world economic system allowing this level of investment without a real path to return anytime soon. \n\nOpen AI is not the only AI company so letting them act like this is moronic or at a minimum irresponsible.",

So... use at your own risk.\n\n[https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-refined-novis](https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-refined-novis)\n\n[https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-refined-novis-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Nabbers1999/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-refined-novis-GGUF)\n\nLink to the 27B redit post:  \n[Yet another uncensored Gemma 3 27B](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1pxb89w/yet_another_uncensored_gemma_3_27b/)\n\nI have also confirmed that this model works with GGUF-my-Repo if you need other quants. Just point it at the original transformers model.\n\n[https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-repo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-repo)\n\nFor those interested in the technical aspects of this further training, this model's neutrality training was performed using  **L**ayerwise **I**mportance **S**ampled **A**damW (**LISA).** Their method offers an alternative to LoRA that not only reduces the amount of memory required to fine tune full weights, but also reduces the risk of catastrophic forgetting by limiting the number of layers being trained at any given time.  \nResearch souce: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919v4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919v4)",

You could just grab entry-level versions of newer chips for raw processing power and potentially cluster them together.\n\nBasically: Lock in the RAM now, upgrade compute later on the cheap.\n\nAm I thinking about this right, or am I missing something obvious about how clustering/distributed inference would actually work with Apple Silicon?",

The majority of the DRAM they buy is ordinary LPDDR for iPhones.\n\nIt will be interesting times, for sure. RAM is only a fraction of the BOM cost, especially for MacBook Pro and Mac Studio.

          "text": "Unfortunately I think the answer is “we don’t know yet”. The Exo / RDMA stuff is exciting, but it’s still not entirely clear how it will play out and what the real-world capabilities are. The Exo folks did post a teaser showing a DGX ‘clustered’ to a Mac Studio over TB implying that prompt processing on the Nvidia and inference on the Mac was better than just running the Mac, but it was short on details. At some point even TB5 bandwidth is going to be a limitation, and it’s entirely possible that the NPU improvements in the M5 series will be good enough to make the added complexity of clustering unattractive.\n\nThere also was a post a couple months back about someone getting an AMD gpu working (for compute, not graphics output) in a TB PCIE dock on an Apple Silicon Mac, but this was just a POC and I don’t believe it was to the point of actually being able to run LLM models on it. Personally I think this is more intriguing as it seems more likely to gain adoption in the ‘budget crowd’  - dropping a 7900XTX into a dock is less daunting than managing multiple machines. But once again - whether this is actually something that willl work ‘in production’ remains to be seen.\n\nI’m struggling with the same questions. I have a 64GB M1 Max, and really want to move to at least 128GB. But an M5 Max128GB  might be $5k+ with the ram shortage. An M4 Max is too limited in PP compared to what ‘should be’ coming to make me comfortable sinking the $$ into it at the moment, although if the external GPU idea materializes that would probably change. I’m seriously eyeing a Framework Strix Halo motherboard with the idea that the X4 slot might allow hybrid GPU/Unified functionallity, but I haven’t actuallly seen any results suggesting you can divide PP/TG to really get the best of both worlds. (i.e. basically the same idea as an external GPU on a Mac, but with lower TG performance)",

If you want something a little easier to start with try Forge or Automatic1111 - they're more like permanent workflows where you just fill in the boxes you want to use and hit go. When you understand how all the parts work together then you can come over to Comfy and start putting the pieces of the workflow together like building blocks. Main thing you gotta know is there are a few base models that have a bunch of derivatives and you can only combine parts made for the same base model, Stable Diffusion XL checkpoints, Loras, controlnets, etc will only work with other SDXL components. And Flux ones will only work with Flux. So don't try to mix them. But if there's one thing that really drives this community forward, it's the endless drive of millions of users for on-demand custom porn, so you are far more likely to have more options than you know what to do with.\n\nWhen you're feeling really adventurous, some of the chat front ends can give your text models the ability to send prompts to your image models to make their own pictures. If you have the vram space to run a chat bot with a vision model and an image generating model together, you can send dirty selfies to your virtual Waifu that it can actually \"see\" and then it can send some back.",

It's not bad, though a bit slow.\n\nI certainly see a difference when running the full 123B devstral-2 via Mistral Vibe (currently free access), which is quite good. But the 24B variant is at least usable.\n\nI like nemo 3 nano for its speed. It's about 4-5x faster for prompt processing and token generation.\n\nIt works pretty well within Mistral Vibe and if you want to see the thinking setting --reasoning-format to none in llama.cpp seems to work without breaking the tool calls. I had issues getting nemo 3 nano working with zed's default agent.\n\nI haven't tried Mistral Vibe directly from the CLI yet though.",
