The documentation gap for multi-GPU is real, I've spent more time piecing together config from GitHub issues than actual docs.\n\n2. Good to hear. I'm mixing card types but pinning models deliberately so each card basically runs independently.\n\n3. That's a fast ROI, are you running inference as a service or using it for internal workloads?\n\n4. This is the point I keep coming back to. The trend toward stronger smaller models is exactly why I went with a distributed multi-card approach rather than dumping everything into one or two massive GPUs. If a 70B model can do what a 400B does today, having flexible GPU allocation matters more than raw single-card VRAM.\n\n5. Haha noted. I did a lot of benchmarking and testing before committing to the full build, but I can see how easy it would be to overbuy on hardware that doesn't match your actual workload.  I also spent around $5-6k using open AI API (Using Chat GPT 4o) via Azure in December.\n\n",

          "text": "Your build is awesome, I am doing something very similar.  Here are some improvements you may want to consider:\n\n1. Upgrade your processor to improve your memory bandwidth.  You have a Threadripper Pro CPU and Motherboard which is better than the non pro Threadripper systems for two reasons: a) more PCIe lanes and b) 8 memory channels.  Unfortunately the 9955wx CPU only has two CCDs so can't utilize all 8 memory channels - you need a CPU with more CCDs (such as the 9965wx) to make use of the 8 memory channels.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mcrx23/psa\\_the\\_new\\_threadripper\\_pros\\_9000\\_wx\\_are\\_still/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mcrx23/psa_the_new_threadripper_pros_9000_wx_are_still/)\n2. PCIe 5.0 has benefits for AI.  The 3090tis are good bang/buck but they are running over PCIe 4.0 so can't take advantage of the new PCIe 5.0 features.  The actual benefit of an all PCIe 5.0 solution depends on your use case and model but it is more than just twice the bandwidth. [https://www.graniteriverlabs.com/en-us/technical-blog/pcie-gen-5-ai-ml](https://www.graniteriverlabs.com/en-us/technical-blog/pcie-gen-5-ai-ml)\n3. The up coming Apple M5 systems may very well be the best bang/buck due to their recently released RDMA over TB5, MLX AI acceleration and its high speed unified memory architecture.  I am really looking forward to seeing how a cluster of M5 mac minis does.  Check out exo: [https://github.com/exo-explore/exo](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo)",

          "text": "I run 6 rtx 3060s (12GB each) on a dual processor xeon 2690 v4 and 128GB of ram, also in an open air mining case.  I only run Debian 12, one instance of ollama and only one model at a time.\n\nI spent a fair amount of time on PCIe and power tuning.  A lot of performance problems that I had was because when running a larger model that spanned multiple cards, the latency caused by traversing the PCIe bus (and sometimes Numa node) was just long enough that the cards power management would bump it from P2 to P5+, then jump back up to P2 when it actually needed to do something, which added even more latency, which caused cascading slowdown across all the cards where I'd start off really fast, then as the response typed out, it would progressively slow down to the point of just a couple tokens a second.  My setup is not PCIe x16 for every card, so that also exacerbated the issue.\n\nThe solution was multi-fold: \n1. set the power management so that the cards idle at P3 and jump to P2 for inference.  This fixed a huge amount of performance problems with larger contexts and responses.  \n2. Put the cards that actually have PCIe x16 connections on the ends of the chain and the x8 cards in the middle.  Also, order the cards (in ollama.service) so that all the cards on each numa node are together to minimize the number of cross numa jumps during inference.  \n3. Also in the bios, set the PCI max request packet size to 4096.  On my particular system, it defaulted to 128.  Turns out the 3060s won't do more than 256, but it's worth more than a couple tokens a second.\n4. Also in the BIOS, turn rebar on so the system can see and address the entire PCIe VRAM instead of addressing it in 256MB chunks, also worth a few more tokens per second.",

If you have any errors during training: timeout, gpu fell off (I forget the exact wording), weird training speeds, etc, it's most likely your cables.  You need pcie retimer/redriver card with those cable lengths.  Especially with pcie5.  Check any professional training servers, they have retimer/redriver if the gpu is not plugged into the pcie slot.  Heck, my HBA cards have a retimer to connect to my HDD/NVME.  On the other hand, inference tends to be fine with pcie cables.  Have you done any serious multi-day/week training yet? \n\n2) CPU doesn't matter as much as people think.  I use an 8 core AMD 7002 cpu, never maxed it out once during training.  Just cache everything (latents/embeds/etc) before training.  Which you should be doing anyway to save vram during training.\n\n3) PCIE speed also doesn't matter as much as people think. Going from x16 to x8 only decreases training speed a couple percent.  There isn't a large amount of data exchanged between gpus during training, assuming you wrote a good trainer.  PCIE latency is the real killer.\n\n4) RAM is awesome.  You can do so much more with more ram.  GPU offset to ram, keeping everything in ram, using ram to write temp files to, EMA can done on cpu, etc.  Having more ram makes everything easier.  I just upgraded to 1TB for dataset curation use.\n\n5) HDD space is also awesome.  I have \\~400TB, it's not enough.  Just being able keeping a copy of fully prepped, ,ready to train, cached dataset on disk with the original data is so nice.   Then you can store your embeddings, and whatever else on disk with the original data.   \n  \nRam and disk space used properly can reduce vram usage during training, and significantly speed up training, especially for multi-run training.",

I have just been analyzing massive amounts of company data to build into a combo of duckdb, neo4j and embedding graph. I will deploy a chatbot integrated into teams for the users to start using and store all of the query info so I can use that info to them finetune the models for better output.\n\nThe training aspect, is something I really have zero experience with, so I will learn about it while I am attempting to build out that pipeline, but I am still a bit away from that point.\n\nAnother commenter posted a good video about pcie retimer/Redriver cards, honestly was the first time I heard about them. I have to look into it more, from what I gathered they are pretty pricy, but at this point, if it will improve things, then I will make the investment. I have to get a better/larger open air rig, bc the one I have is too small.\n\nSo CPU I can leave as is then , I mean it's not the top of the line, but it's up there.\n\nDo you think I should get more ram? The prices of course are out of control. I initially bought 128 GB for 1600, then decided a week later I wanted 256 total, so when I went to buy another 128 gb kit the price was already up to $2k and when I check yesterday that same kit was now $3k. Nuts!\n\nI only have the 3 nvme ssds. I am storing all of the models on the 9100 and everything else on the 990 pros. I was thinking about getting some mechanical sata HDDs for long term storage and backups maybe 8-10TB.\n\nThanks again. I also do not yet know how to optimize/comfigure the HDD and the ram as per your recommendations, but I will add all of this to the seemingly endless list of things I need to figure out - hah. \n\nThanks again! \n\nBtw - I ended up adding a 3rd blackwell.

Started with 2x 3090 and slowly built up from there.  \nI have zero experience with training LLMs, but I have written my own fully custom multi-gpu text-to-image trainers.  I assume my training experience with transfer over to what you're doing, but maybe LLM training has it's own quicks.\n\nPCIe retimer/redriver:   \nWhen I first started learning programming, I lost 6 months of training time due to pcie cables.  Gpu, fell off the bus, time outs, really strange training speeds (one run would be 2-3x the speed of the next)  Asked everyone everywhere, no one had any idea what was wrong.  Re-wrote my scripts, bought the most expensive cables I could find, thought I was going crazy, and nearly gave up.  Tried a retimer card, problem solved.  I learned a lot about multi-gpu training during that time, but that's not the best way to learn.  I also burnt the retimer chip on my first card, so use fans on your retimer/redrivers.   \n  \nFor me, retimer/redriver card is non-optional for training.  I won't even consider training without one.  If an problem shows up, how do I know it's not the cables?  I bought my cards for \\~$150 each.  They do x16 or 2 x8.  Make sure you ask the seller if they support 2x 8/x16.  A lot of cards support 4 x4 by default, and the seller needs to flash the card to support 2x 8/x16. You'll also need the cables and the pcie boards.\n\nAlso, pcie cables seem fine for inference.  I never had a problem with inference when using pcie cables.\n\nRam:  \nRam prices are stupid, I know.  I just bought 1TB DDR4 2666mhz ram for $3800, I think I did OK for current market.  3200mhz would have been double the price, I don't even want to think about what ddr5 costs.  The 1tb ram is to be used for the image dataset sorting: embedding clustering and such.  \n  \nRam really benefits for fast gpus with low vram.  When I used 2x 3090 to train the sdxl unet, I had to use FSDP GRAD\\_SHARD\\_OP to get the model to fit into memory.  But there still wasn't enough vram room for a large enough batch size to saturate the gpu core.  So I used just enough ram via cpu\\_offset to saturate the core.  I lost some speed due to the cpu\\_offset, but I gained more speed via  increased batch size for core utilization.  Ram will help your 3090s more than the pro 6000.\n\nStandard training advice is ram = 2x total vram, and on my two 3090s, I was using \\~100GB ram during training.  A lot of the open source trainers focus on being conservative with vram/ram, so it won't matter as much.  But if you're writing your own code, there is just so much you can do with more ram: holding extra models, prefetch batches, ema, etc.    \n  \nFor standard consumer gpus, I highly suggest 2x total training gpu vram.  But maybe LLM training can use less?  And the pro6000s aren't vram starved. So, who knows? Regardless, 256 is enough to get started.    \n  \nFor ram (and vram): size is more important than speed.  Speed is nice, but if you don't have enough size, you're screwed.  So if you see a good deal on slightly slower speed, but a larger amount, buy it.\n\nHDDs:  \nI do blocks of 8 HDDs.  Most motherboards have 8 sata ports, HBA cards have 8/16/24, so 8 is a good number.  ZFS is the file system of choice, it's near impossible to lose your data.  I use raidz2 with a L2ARC metadata cache partition on a cheap sdd.  The ssd cache significantly speeds up the HDDs. It's fast enough for text-to-image training, don't know about LLM.  I buy used enterprise HDDs, no problems so far. Buy from a reputable seller and you're good.\n\nYou're cpu is most likely fine, unless LLM training has crazy cpu requirements.  Ram and HDDs will benefit you more.\n\nAlso, consider what you want to do with the pro6000s & 3090s.  Should they really be in the same machine?  I can't imagine they're be used together, unless you're running some huge model just for fun.  Maybe buy an old AMD 7002/7003 board and split off the 3090s?  \n  \nI will use my pro6000s for training with a 4090 48GB for support (validation/ema/etc) and inference. All the other gpus will be used for dataset curation.  So I'm considering moving 2x 4090 48GB and 2x 3090 to the data server, and leaving the 2x pro6000 and a 4090 48GB in the training server.",

Well, add another $200 for whatever low ram stick you can find just to run the thing. The remaining $600 will go on connecting all that with x8 bifurcation. This is where you are out of money, but you need 2-3 of more good PSUs and at least one SSD drive.\n\nSo no, 10K PC will not run this. But 11K-12K PC could.

For coding, that usually shows up as wrong APIs, subtle logic bugs, or broken refactors, invalid json generation. In practice, 4-bit is often considered the lowest “comfortable” range for usable quants.\n\nThat said, it really depends on the quantization method and how well it’s done. A very good 3-bit quant of GLM-5 could actually be interesting to try. But I’d be very skeptical that a typical 1-bit GLM-5 would outperform an 8-bit Qwen coder for real coding work.",

Speeds go up if you use a smaller quantization but there's no need to sacrifice quality.\n\nI've been messing about with Step-3.5-Flash and MiniMax-M2.5 though, which are 196B and 229B respectively.  Both fit okay with an IQ3 based quantization, but Step seems to suffer a fair bit at that level, while MiniMax however seems to be just fine, or at least, it's hasn't really put a foot wrong in the coding tasks I've asked of it.\n\nBasically I'm refining an IQ3 quant of MiniMax, as well as tuning the VM parameters of the kernel, to get it running as smooth as possible.  It seems to be ticking along at 30tg/sec as of this morning, and it generally emits better quality output that works the first or second time, whereas Qwen Coder Next makes a lot of small mistakes that I really need to keep an eye on.\n\nI also found out today how to fix a chat template bug that was in the original release of MiniMax, and I now have it working really well (again, as if today).",

It took us a couple weeks to get them all in properly, and we update them every weekend now, so it's a pretty valuable asset that we can sell/subscribe to law firms, CPAs or compliance consultants.\n\nWe're also working with a Medical compliance officer to develop a Medical Compliance Expert(HIPAA/GDPR/State Level) at the moment, we hope to have that one done in a month or so.",

Same thing if you want to run larger models: you can link two GB10s together to get 256 GB of memory, which can let you run MiniMax M2.1 at roughly Q4 equivalent without issues using vLLM.\n\nI don’t have a Mac, but in my opinion it’s not worth it, except for an M3 Ultra with 256 GB / 512 GB of RAM.",

It’s also roughly 15% faster on token generation/writing (tg).\n\nTo make it concrete: if you’re coding with it using opencode, opencode injects a 10,000-token preprompt up front (tooling, capabilities, etc.). Add ~5,000 input tokens for a detailed request plus one or two context files, and you’re quickly at ~15,000 input tokens.\n\nOn that workload, the Asus GB10 needs under ~3 seconds to process the ~15k-token input and then starts generating at roughly 55–60 tok/s. The Strix Halo, meanwhile, takes just under ~30 seconds before it even begins generating, at around ~50 tok/s. You see the difference?\n\nIn other words, the GB10 can read 15,000 tokens and generate a bit more than 1500 tokens of output before the Strix Halo has started writing anything.\n\nAnd that’s where the GB10 really shines with VLLM : if, for example, someone is chatting with GPT-OSS-120B while you’re coding, performance doesn’t get cut in half. It typically drops by only a few percent.",

The DGX is going to always be faster for token processing due to the ARM based architecture, but the DGX only has about 7% faster memory than the Strix Halo, so token generation speeds are always going to be at about that ratio of a difference.\n\nFrom what I've read, the 128GB M4 Mac has the same memory bandwidth as the DGX Spark, so it's also going to generate at about the same speed as the Spark (with both being \\~7% faster than the Strix on average).  I don't know what the processing speeds are like on the Max though.

I’m torn between two paths:\n\nOption 1: Mac Studio – Can spec it up to 192gb(yeah i dont have money for 512gb) unified memory. Would let me run absolutely massive models locally without VRAM constraints. But the performance isn’t optimized for ML model training as to CUDA, and the raw compute is weaker. Like basic models would tale days\n\nOption 2: NVIDIA GPU setup – Way better performance and optimization (CUDA ecosystem is unmatched), but I’m bottlenecked by VRAM. Even a 5090 only has 32GB,.\n\nIdeally I want the memory capacity of Mac + the raw power of NVIDIA, but that doesn’t exist in one box.\n\nHas anyone found a good solution? Hybrid setup? ",

It should be coming later this year and will be far better for all AI workloads than the previous gen Macs due to the built in matmul acceleration in the M5 GPU.

      "text": "For all TLDR:\n\n Qwen3 8b-vl is the best in its weight class for recognizing formatted text (even better than Mistral 14b with OCR).\n\nFor others:\n\nHi everyone, this is my first post. I wanted to discuss my observations regarding LLMs with OCR capabilities.\n\nWhile developing a utility for automating data processing from documents, I needed to extract text from specific areas of documents. Initially, I thought about using OCR, like Tesseract, but I ran into the issue of having no control over the output. Essentially, I couldn't recognize the text and make corrections (for example, for surnames) in a single request.\n\nI decided to try Qwen3 8b-vl. It turned out to be very simple. The ability to add data to the system prompt for cross-referencing with the recognized text and making corrections on the fly proved to be an enormous killer feature. You can literally give it all the necessary data, the data format, and the required output format for its response. And you get a response in, say, a JSON format, which you can then easily convert into a dictionary (if we're talking about Python).\n\nI tried Mistral 14b, but I found that its text recognition on images is just terrible with the same settings and system prompt (compared to Qwen3 8b-vl). Smaller models are simply unusable. Since I'm sending single requests without saving context, I can load the entire model with a 4k token context and get a stable, fast response processed on my GPU.\n\nIf people who work on extracting text from documents using LLMs (visual text extraction) read this, I'd be happy to hear about your experiences.\n\nFor reference, my specs:\nR7 5800X\nRTX 3070 8GB\n32GB DDR4\n\nUPD: Forgot to mention. I work with Cyrillic text recognition, so everyone from the CIS segment reading this post can be sure that it applies to Cyrillic alphabets as well.",

This is the Real World Coworker we've been waiting for: something that costs $1 for an hour of intensive work. If you read their RL technical blog, it's clear they're prioritizing tool-use and search (76.3% on BrowseComp) over just being a \"chatty\" bot.
