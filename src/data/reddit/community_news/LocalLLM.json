Then depending on what else they want built the price jumps significantly. Orchestration agents - SwarmAI - Automations - if they need media generated for ads with brand AI influencers (we’re technically an ad agency first so we run ads primarily but now with AI we also sell AI solutions) - basically I’ve set it up where you pick your niche, roofer, dentist, med spa, law firm etc and we come in and sell you the foundation $10k then offer the “HQ Pro” (what I ended up calling them) and those have a ton of agentic infrastructure and automations designed specifically for those niches. Also clients can build a custom infrastructure which is more bespoke to what they need it to do and be for their business. The HQ Pro’s are about $25k+ and a full custom bespoke build is about… well… I actually just raised my prices so it’s now $69,000 (use to be $35k starting and increase based on scope of what we’re building) and I might raise them again to $100,000 because the idea is we’re replacing 1 employee salary and building a infrastructure that can run your whole business for you potentially replacing 100s of employees. At least that’s how I pitch it. I say “close your eyes, imagine what you want this thing to do for you, okay now let’s build it.” But yea, fun times.",

If you ran too many epochs this can happen as well…. Try reducing epochs and LR after making sure you have removed all duplicates. Try with an LR of 1.5e-5 and then walk it up. Rank 32, alpha 64. If it continues, you don’t  have enough sample diversity. Try these first then walk up your learning strength until you find the expression you are looking for.  Chances are you have too many samples. That 1.5b can intake 500-2000 samples max. Anything less than 25 separate sample types can cause this…. Diversity is key.",

Seems that for some reason if you passed a context that was close to the maximum it would get stuck in a repeating loop. No more problems since I did this.",

Handles **text, 2D images, 3D CT/MRI volumes, and whole-slide pathology** straight out of the box. No more toy models; this eats real clinical data.\n\nKey upgrades from MedGemma-1 (27B was text-heavy; this is compact + vision-first):\n\n# Imaging Benchmarks \n\n* **CT disease findings**: 58% → 61% acc\n* **MRI disease findings**: 51% → 65% acc\n* **Histopathology (ROUGE-L on slides)**: 0.02 → 0.49 (matches PolyPath SOTA)\n* **Chest ImaGenome (X-ray localization)**: IoU 3% → 38%\n* **MS-CXR-T (longitudinal CXR)**: macro-acc 61% → 66%\n* Avg single-image (CXR/derm/path/ophtho): 59% → 62%\n\nNow supports **DICOM natively** on GCP – ditch custom preprocessors for hospital PACS integration. Processes 3D vols as slice sets w/ NL prompts, pathology via patches.\n\n# Text + Docs \n\n* **MedQA (MCQ)**: 64% → 69%\n* **EHRQA**: 68% → 90%\n* **Lab report extraction** (type/value/unit F1): 60% → 78%\n\nPerfect backbone for RAG over notes, chart summarization, or guideline QA. 4B keeps inference cheap.\n\nBonus: **MedASR** (Conformer ASR) drops WER on medical dictation:\n\n* Chest X-ray: 12.5% → 5.2% (vs Whisper-large-v3)\n* Broad medical: 28.2% → 5.2% (**82% error reduction**)\n\nGrab it on [HF](https://huggingface.co/google/medgemma-1.5-4b-it) or Vertex AI. Fine-tune for your workflow – not a diagnostic tool, but a solid base.\n\nWhat are you building with this? Local fine-tunes for derm/path? EHR agents? Drop your setups below.",

I have it at 32 for gpt-oss-120b and run about 120k context.

Not a hard rule, but it is a good starting place.  If you want to feed a big input, you may need something smaller.  \n\nYou can spill over into system RAM, but your speed will drop big time.  The Qwen 3 30B A3B actaully does OK even if it does spill over a bit.   It may be one of the largest models you can run effectively.",

I'd prefer if you contributed to this project though =) you'd be working through issues either way if you took the neural memory just as a factor of writing your own architecture. \n\nThere is a potential issue with the sliding window required for the neural memory, you may have chunk boundary issues. From my testing I have this resolved, but I haven't gone past 50k steps on it yet to make sure it doesn't crop up again later.\n\nI also submitted this to the hackathon for this subreddit https://github.com/bigwolfeman/Retnet-Distillation \n\nI do not recommend using retnet for this. It is extremely unstable and slow. I had to patch torchscale just to make it work at all and kept finding issues in torchscale. But there is a nice reference implementation of keeping the teacher in vram beside the student, caching it's logits to disk, or inferencing from a vllm server and exposing top k logits.\n\nEven with how unstable retention is, it may be worth implementing to resolve chunk boundary problems. I am currently not maintaining retention in TitanMAC, but if further testing shows issues I'm planning to use it.\n\nAlso, my repo has the nested learning module based on SGD. It is a memory efficient optimizer. Allowing for more parameters with less vram. \n\nIf you're interested in using this repo, reach out to me. I have a branch I am doing a lot of development work on. I have found that feeding in hyper connections directly to the nested optimizer gives it richer signals for convergence and is basically free to do. It may be possible to average gradient heuristics to 16x16 tiles using my development branch, but I haven't had time to test this yet. It is the last step of the dynamic sparse implementation I'm working on in that branch. \n\n---\n\nOther great use for so much vram: distill a VLM to V-JEPA.\nDistill to HOPE https://github.com/Sk16er/hope_nano HOPE is a vram monster, I don't think this architecture is ready to scale yet, but it's research value is tremendous.\n\nEdit: the custom kernels are targeting blackwell, but they're written in Triton. Getting them ready for an h100 shouldn't be too bad.\n\nIf this deployment you want to do is far enough out in the future, I am planning on implementing the entire architecture in mojo for further performance gains. I'm still ablating several takes on the sparsity before I do this. The current code isn't designed to shard across gpus, though pytorch makes it fairly easy. Mojo is very good at sharing, though I haven't tested that myself.",

This was tested in OpenCode.\n\nThis comes after extensive research into lesser-known models that significantly outperform what most LLM users seem to be using. Even so, the experience remains far from ideal.\n\nMy conclusion: the practical minimum for serious work is around 36GB of VRAM. The reason is context.\n\nSufficient context is essential for the model to genuinely understand your project and operate coherently within it. For coding tasks, you want as much context as possible—and at 256K tokens, you're looking at roughly 16GB of VRAM for the KV cache alone, before accounting for the model weights. This assumes aggressive quantization (q8/q4). You'd need even more if you're not willing to sacrifice quality here (20-40GB).\n\nCPU offloading is technically possible, but latency scales catastrophically as context fills; waiting an hour per prompt is simply untenable for agentic workflows.\n\nProcessing speed further constrains your options, effectively limiting you to MoE architectures with small activation sizes.\n\nThe only models in this class that handle tool calls reliably exceed 30B total parameters. \n\nThe practical minimum I've found is Unsloth's T1 quant of Qwen 3 Next 80-A3B, which requires just over 20GB on its own.\n\nIn sum: 32GB is workable if you're willing to compromise on context. Otherwise, you're looking at 36GB—which means either multi-GPU configurations or stepping up to professional-grade hardware.",

You are looking at around 128GB VRAM, since these models degrade very quickly when quantized. Any smaller models are highly inconsistent for coding and are simply not worth the time.\n\nGoing one size above takes you to MiniMax-M2.1, which is a surprisingly capable coding agent. It puchnes way above its weight. You can get away with 160GB VRAM before the model becomes braindead due to quantization.\n\nFinally, at 448GB you can run lightly quantized DeepSeek 671B models with great results.\n\nIn general, coding performance degrades quickly with quantization, and **Q4\\_K or INT4 are not good enough!** The smaller the model, the more it is affected by quantization. For example, Kimi-K2 is usable with all the experts quantized as 4 bit. But the same is not true for MiniMax-M2.",

No token limits and depending on number of GPUs and VRAM, could be cheap enough per hour. \n\nWould need some effort up front to make it resilient so when a spot instance goes down. It fires up another in a different family.  But it's possible.\n\nAnsible or whatever config tool would need to setup the ai infra (vllm / ollama) and pull the model required.\n\nTrash the instance when done for the day as can fire up another next time.  \n\nOption B) Fine tuning smaller model for specific use case.\n\nThis is the one I will be testing in short term. I am an Oracle Developer (25 years) in a niche vertical (Retail).  Plsql is present in foundation models but it's most likely from stack overflow or a side effect.  Haven't found anywhere it's part of primary training set.  \n\nIf I ask copilot to create a plsql function, it will have a go but results are mixed.  If it had currency conversion, it doesn't know I have a STD function for that.  It doesn't know all my package functions returna Boolean and an error_msg variable.  So the suggestions all need amending.\n\nIf I fine tune for my niche code, then I should be able to have a much better experience than foundation models (TBC by testing).",

This post is a pure example of what I keep meaning when I talk about the massive amount of people trying to jump into AI without slightly even caring to learn to basics.\n\n512 gb.\n\nIf you think i’m exaggerating and think anything under 256 gb will be useable, you have way too much to learn.\n\nGLM 4.7 which is already not even as smart as GPT 5.2 or sonnet 4.5 requires a bare bare minimum of 256 gb of vram, and even with 256 gb of vram it will be dumbed down and slow. \n\nIntelligence is exponential, meaning a 3b model will not be 1/10th the intelligence of a 30b model. It will be much lower than 1/10th. You can try to run 30b models or even 120b models as much as you want, but what makes it even worse is that for the technically unskilled, you need a model that is as smart as possible to make up for your gaps in knowledge.\n\nThe strongest point of LLMs is that is allows us humans for recursive learning. Beginner sets up LLM. Beginner asks LLM how to use it agentically. Beginner uses agentic LLM to code and ask further questions on how to code and so on. But for this to work you need actual passion and motivation, and thats not something that can be given, nor created.\n\nIf you are asking this question then you are not ready and do not have the motivation to get into this because if you did you would have already figured this part out.",

Typical tasks would include:\n- Code completion\n- Refactoring\n- Understanding and navigating large codebases\n- General coding Q&A / problem-solving\n\nSecondary (nice-to-have) use cases, mostly for learning and experimentation:\n- Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech\n- Image-to-Video / Text-to-Video\n- Other multimodal or generative AI experiments\n\nI understand these two machines are very different in philosophy:\n- DGX Spark: CUDA ecosystem, stronger raw GPU compute, more “proper” AI workstation–style setup\n- MacBook Pro (M4 Max): unified memory, portability, strong Metal performance, Apple ML stack (MLX / CoreML)\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand from people with hands-on experience:\n- For local LLM inference focused on coding, which one makes more sense day-to-day?\n- How much does VRAM vs unified memory matter in real-world local LLM usage?\n- Is the Apple Silicon ecosystem mature enough now to realistically replace something like Claude Code?\n- Any gotchas around model support, tooling, latency, or developer workflow?\n\nI’m not focused on training large models — this is mainly about fast, reliable local inference that can realistically support daily coding work.\n\nWould really appreciate insights from anyone who has used either (or both).",

If you want Claude level performance then you’re better off paying for Claude because you can easily spend upwards of $10k plus and still never hit what Claude or ChatGPT or Gemini deliver. \n\nBenchmarks for the M5 show a significant increase in performance for LLM’s over the base M4 and there are some rumors of new MacBook Pro’s being released at the end of the month so you might want to wait a few weeks and see if Apple introduces MacBooks with the M5 Pro and Max.",

As much as I love my local hosted models, the goal with local is privacy, wanting to learn from the ground up, and shielding against market uncertainty, not getting the best inference experience. I have a 256gb mac studio and I get very good local inference but I am spending a lot of time trying to configure local systems to manage context/ memory better. \n\nThe model outputs like glm 4.7 are great for me at q4 (I argue near if not at frontier level) but models at that level start around 20t/s for me and slow down as context increases. Plus I can only manage so much context to run locally on my mac studio so even if speed weren't an issue memory becomes an issue. So systems breaking things into smaller tasks help keep the models faster but introduce complexity too.\n\nI use claude in cursor for work and these aren't concerns. I just use the model and get top tier performance with no worries. I have a 128gb strix halo that gets similar speeds to the spark. I use that as a side gpt-oss120b for agentic tasks with moderate to low logic requirements for tasks other than coding. That's like gemini flash 2.5 doing agentic tasks for you not the model that we worry about replacing us lol",

They’re completely choosing to ignore the fact that on paper, nvidia is supposed to have much much better capability - and thats perfectly true, the spark can do many many things that would take the m3 ultra many times over to do the same exact thing such as fine tuning or image/video gen - but if your goal is to do pure pure agentic inference, there simply is nothing that beats the m3 ultra. Its not a matter of opinion or whatever, its something that can be proved literally every single time. \n\nIf your goal is to have the llm read as many documents as possible and organize them or whatever, the spark wins by a massive amount but fails completely on actual text generation.\n\nif u find someone pushing you on the fact that the dgx spark is better than the m3 ultra for agentic coding workflows, tell them to prove it, im willing to load up a model and run tests to show it.\n\nnvidia fan boys will say \"the m3 ultra is only better on paper and not in actuality\" - when thats literally the complete opposite. the spark has much more extensive capabilities in terms of actual numbers in hardware. the m3 ultra is lacking extensive things that the dgx spark has. yet llm's run better on the mac studio m3 ultra. people are literally mad that there nvidia toybox isnt able to do as well as apple, completely forgetting that the nvidia tax is a real thing that even massive megacorporations admit to, why cant people accept that their paying extremely high for a machine that simply does not perform as good as the m3 ultra? how much longer are people going to keep arguing with me about this but not one single person is willing to actually put it to the test when i ask?\n\nagain, if anyone is so confident that the dgx spark is able to beat the m3 mac studio in terms of speed for pure text generation, im willing to bet $100 into an escrow of ur choice if you're willing to match just to  prove you wrong. its a free $100 for you right?",

Conclusion\n\nThe choice between MLX (Mac Studio) and DGX Spark for agentic coding is ultimately a choice between **Bandwidth** and **Intelligence**.\n\n**MLX** offers the raw horsepower to generate text rapidly, making it the superior \"Typewriter.\" However, its current software limitations regarding cache reuse in branching scenarios make it a forgetful writer—one that must constantly re-read the entire book to write an alternative ending.\n\n**DGX Spark** offers the architectural sophistication of a datacenter. It is a slower \"Typewriter\" due to memory bandwidth limits, but possessed of a photographic memory for context. In complex, non-linear agentic workflows where \"thinking\" (branching, backtracking, and planning) dominates \"typing\" (linear generation), the DGX Spark's ability to reuse the KV cache via TensorRT-LLM makes it the more performant and robust platform.\n\nFor the immediate future (2026), until MLX natively incorporates Radix Tree caching and PagedAttention primitives, the NVIDIA ecosystem remains the pragmatic choice for serious *autonomous* agent development, while the Mac Studio remains the king of *interactive* local coding assistance.",

For a typical coding task involving a 10,000-token context, my calculations show that while a high-compute system might start working five seconds faster, the more bandwidth-heavy system completes the generation phase significantly earlier. In multi-step agentic workflows where a model might output code across 50 iterations, the cumulative time saved during the 'typing' phase quickly renders any initial ingestion advantage irrelevant.\n\nCalculating the Total Timeline\n\nI am synthesizing a total execution model that adjudicates between starting fast and finishing fast. My findings indicate that in a typical programming loop involving 40 to 60 turns, the cumulative time saved during the actual writing of code blocks is the decisive factor. While a competitor might save five seconds on an initial file read, a system with triple the data throughput saves multiple seconds on every single response it generates. Over the course of a standard coding task, this generation advantage accumulates into a lead that no amount of initial processing speed can overcome.\n\nThe Ingestion vs. Generation Math\n\nI have been mathematically deconstructing the performance intersection when an agent reads new files mid-task. My calculations show that even when an agent pulls in a fresh 1,000-token block of code, a high-bandwidth system only needs to generate about 55 tokens of output to reach the finish line first. Given that professional coding agents frequently generate hundreds of tokens of refactored logic or debugging logs per turn, the 'typing' speed of the memory pipeline remains the definitive bottleneck for the total session time.",

Get a DGX. It’ll be much faster.",

Don’t want to believe me? Dm me and we can do some tests, and not just with gpt oss 120b but an actual real model that we would want to use.\n\n\nAre people really trying to say that the prompt processing is THAT MUCH INSANELY faster that the token gen speed outbeats the m3 ultra? Like yes the spark has much faster prompt processing but even if the text generation starts much earlier, that text generation will end much after the m3 ultra has already done prompt processing and fully generated. Is it not simple logic? Are you really really trying to say that if we put a dgx spark and a m3 ultra side by side and gave the same prmpts with the same inferencing engine and actual model to use for real coding, that the spark would win?",

          "text": "\"3.3 The \"Cross-Over\" Efficiency Point\n\nResearch by EXO Labs introduces a critical concept: the cross-over point where one machine's advantage cancels out the other's.\n\n* Because the Spark starts faster (low TTFT) but runs slower (low TPS), and the Mac starts slower (high TTFT) but runs faster (high TPS), there is a specific prompt-to-generation ratio where the total time is identical.\n* **Short Prompt / Long Response:** The Mac wins easily. The initial 2-second lag is instantly recovered by the blazing fast generation.\n* **Long Prompt / Short Response:** The Spark wins. If the task is \"Read this book and say 'Yes' or 'No',\" the Mac spends 20 seconds reading and 0.1 seconds answering. The Spark spends 5 seconds reading and 0.2 seconds answering.\n\n**Benchmark Synthesis:** The user's intuition that \"token generation speed will make up for the lack in prompt processing\" is mathematically correct for arguably 90% of interactive use cases (chat, coding, writing). The \"Prompt Processing\" advantage of the Spark is a specialized victory relevant primarily for massive RAG ingestion or batch processing, not the fluidity of conversation.   \n\n\"\n\n**Final Verdict:**\n\n* **DGX Spark is Faster When:** You are processing massive documents (long prompts), running batch classification jobs, fine-tuning models, or require native CUDA support for training.\n* **Mac Studio M3 Ultra is Faster When:** You are chatting, coding, writing, or interacting with the AI in real-time. The generation is smoother, the capacity (up to 512GB) is higher, and the latency per token is significantly lower.\n\nso yeah the mac studio wins for when ur trying to use an actual llm. u dont have to believe me, u can just go ask multiple spark and m3 mac studio owners to prove it. \n\n  \ndont even get me started on mlx kv cache reusing cuz at that point it just starts getting sad for the spark",

I recently tested it out and it has so many cool features. The one that stood out to me was how easy it was to choose diff types of graphic elements within the tool. For the slides, I gave my notes to Claude and asked it clean them up and structure them as slides. It did so and then I fed that into Gamma to build a presentation for me.\n\n  \n2. A productivity tip: I use voice dictation a lot. When I have lots of thoughts and context, I use dictation to feed AI. Be it drafting a long (and important) email, creating an SOP, or similar comms or documentation work, this saves me a lot of time. Also, I don't know the reason, but the results are so much better than when I type instructions. I am a decent writer so proofreading and editing doesn't take me long. Overall, this process works well for me so I definitely recommend testing it.",

They mean “best general-purpose chat without needing extra tool wiring.”\n\nClaude: Anthropic’s models.\n\nGrok: xAI’s model.\n\n\n3) What the jargon means\n\n“Local”: you run the model yourself (privacy, control, but you manage setup + performance).\n\n“Websearch”: hooking the model to a browsing/search tool so it can fetch current info instead of guessing.\n\n“Memory files”: usually means a RAG setup (retrieval-augmented generation): your notes/docs are indexed and the model can pull relevant chunks while answering.\n\n“Big leagues”: basically “best-of-the-best overall.”\n\n“Standalone”: not using tool integrations, agents, RAG, custom workflows—just the model as-is.\n\n“Claude MCP”: almost certainly referring to the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—a way to connect Claude to external tools/services (files, apps, search, automations) in a standardized way.\n\n“Cutthroat / win is a win”: the model will prioritize getting some answer that seems successful, even if it’s not cautious or perfectly aligned with your intent/rules.\n\n“Bend the rules / go around problems”: meaning it may produce confident outputs, shortcuts, or “creative” leaps that sound right but aren’t reliably grounded.\n\n“Wary of long memory and brainstorming without checks”: don’t let it build long chains of assumptions over time; verify with sources, logs, or constraints.\n\n\n4) Why it reads incoherent\n\nIt’s basically:\n\nmissing punctuation,\n\ntypos (“but u f you Claude mcp…” = “but if you use Claude MCP…”),\n\nand it jumps between local model advice and hosted model opinions without transitions.\n\n\nIf you tell me what you were trying to decide (local vs cloud, privacy, work tasks, hardware), I can translate their advice into a concrete recommendation that fits your situation.\"",
