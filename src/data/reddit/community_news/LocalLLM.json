              "text": "My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is",

      "text": "**The Case for a $600 Local LLM Machine**\n\nUsing the Base Model Mac mini M4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5c916gwucoeg1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d91da71f6244d752e15922e47dfbf9d792beb1\n\nby Tony Thomas\n\nIt started as a simple experiment. How much real work could I do on a small, inexpensive machine running language models locally?\n\nWith GPU prices still elevated, memory costs climbing, SSD prices rising instead of falling, power costs steadily increasing, and cloud subscriptions adding up, it felt like a question worth answering. After a lot of thought and testing, the system I landed on was a base model Mac mini M4 with 16 GB of unified memory, a 256 GB internal SSD, a USB-C dock, and a 1 TB external NVMe drive for model storage. Thanks to recent sales, the all-in cost came in right around $600.\n\nOn paper, that does not sound like much. In practice, it turned out to be far more capable than I expected.\n\nLocal LLM work has shifted over the last couple of years. Models are more efficient due to better training and optimization. Quantization is better understood. Inference engines are faster and more stable. At the same time, the hardware market has moved in the opposite direction. GPUs with meaningful amounts of VRAM are expensive, and large VRAM models are quietly disappearing. DRAM is no longer cheap. SSD and NVMe prices have climbed sharply.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, a compact system with tightly integrated silicon starts to look less like a compromise and more like a sensible baseline.\n\n**Why the Mac mini M4 Works**\n\nThe M4 Mac mini stands out because Apple’s unified memory architecture fundamentally changes how a small system behaves under inference workloads. CPU and GPU draw from the same high-bandwidth memory pool, avoiding the awkward juggling act that defines entry-level discrete GPU setups. I am not interested in cramming models into a narrow VRAM window while system memory sits idle. The M4 simply uses what it has efficiently.\n\nSixteen gigabytes is not generous, but it is workable when that memory is fast and shared. For the kinds of tasks I care about, brainstorming, writing, editing, summarization, research, and outlining, it holds up well. I spend my time working, not managing resources.\n\nThe 256 GB internal SSD is limited, but not a dealbreaker. Models and data live on the external NVMe drive, which is fast enough that it does not slow my workflow. The internal disk handles macOS and applications, and that is all it needs to do. Avoiding Apple’s storage upgrade pricing was an easy decision.\n\nThe setup itself is straightforward. No unsupported hardware. No hacks. No fragile dependencies. It is dependable, UNIX-based, and boring in the best way. That matters if you intend to use the machine every day rather than treat it as a side project.\n\n**What Daily Use Looks Like**\n\nThe real test was whether the machine stayed out of my way.\n\nQuantized 7B and 8B models run smoothly using Ollama and LM Studio. AnythingLLM works well too and adds vector databases and seamless access to cloud models when needed. Response times are short enough that interaction feels conversational rather than mechanical. I can draft, revise, and iterate without waiting on the system, which makes local use genuinely viable.\n\nLarger 13B to 14B models are more usable than I expected when configured sensibly. Context size needs to be managed, but that is true even on far more expensive systems. For single-user workflows, the experience is consistent and predictable.\n\nWhat stood out most was how quickly the hardware stopped being the limiting factor. Once the models were loaded and tools configured, I forgot I was using a constrained system. That is the point where performance stops being theoretical and starts being practical.\n\nIn daily use, I rotate through a familiar mix of models. Qwen variants from 1.7B up through 14B do most of the work, alongside Mistral instruct models, DeepSeek 8B, Phi-4, and Gemma. On this machine, smaller Qwen models routinely exceed 30 tokens per second and often land closer to 40 TPS depending on quantization and context. These smaller models can usually take advantage of the full available context without issue.\n\nThe 7B to 8B class typically runs in the low to mid 20s at context sizes between 4K and 16K. Larger 13B to 14B models settle into the low teens at a conservative 4K context and operate near the upper end of acceptable memory pressure. Those numbers are not headline-grabbing, but they are fast enough that writing, editing, and iteration feel fluid rather than constrained. I am rarely waiting on the model, which is the only metric that actually matters for my workflow.\n\n**Cost, Power, and Practicality**\n\nAt roughly $600, this system occupies an important middle ground. It costs less than a capable GPU-based desktop while delivering enough performance to replace a meaningful amount of cloud usage. Over time, that matters more than peak benchmarks.\n\nThe Mac mini M4 is also extremely efficient. It draws very little power under sustained inference loads, runs silently, and requires no special cooling or placement. I routinely leave models running all day without thinking about the electric bill.\n\nThat stands in sharp contrast to my Ryzen 5700G desktop paired with an Intel B50 GPU. That system pulls hundreds of watts under load, with the B50 alone consuming around 50 watts during LLM inference. Over time, that difference is not theoretical. It shows up directly in operating costs.\n\nThe M4 sits on top of my tower system and behaves more like an appliance. Thanks to my use of a KVM, I can turn off the desktop entirely and keep working. I do not think about heat, noise, or power consumption. That simplicity lowers friction and makes local models something I reach for by default, not as an occasional experiment.\n\n**Where the Limits Are**\n\nThe constraints are real but manageable. Memory is finite, and there is no upgrade path. Model selection and context size require discipline. This is an inference-first system, not a training platform.\n\nApple Silicon also brings ecosystem boundaries. If your work depends on CUDA-specific tooling or experimental research code, this is not the right machine. It relies on Apple’s Metal backend rather than NVIDIA’s stack. My focus is writing and knowledge work, and for that, the platform fits extremely well.\n\n**Why This Feels Like a Turning Point**\n\nWhat surprised me was not that the Mac mini M4 could run local LLMs. It was how well it could run them given the constraints.\n\nFor years, local AI was framed as something that required large amounts of RAM, a powerful CPU, and an expensive GPU. These systems were loud, hot, and power hungry, built primarily for enthusiasts. This setup points in a different direction. With efficient models and tightly integrated hardware, a small, affordable system can do real work.\n\nFor writers, researchers, and independent developers who care about control, privacy, and predictable costs, a budget local LLM machine built around the Mac mini M4 no longer feels experimental. It is something I turn on in the morning, leave running all day, and rely on without thinking about the hardware.\n\nMore than any benchmark, that is what matters.\n\nFrom: tonythomas-dot-net",

So permissions end up living either:\n\n* inside prompts (brittle),\n* inside per-tool wrappers (boilerplate explosion),\n* or at the MCP server boundary (coarse, hard to reason about).\n\nThe isolation vs over-permission tradeoff you mention is exactly what happens when there’s no **deny-by-default execution layer** sitting *between* the model and the tools.\n\nWhat’s worked best for us locally is:\n\n* keep MCP servers dumb (pure capability exposure)\n* move auth, cost limits, logging, and allow/deny decisions into a single runtime gate\n* treat every tool call as an auditable event, not “just another function call”\n\nThat way you’re not re-implementing auth + logging per connector, and you’re not trusting the model to behave just because the prompt says so.\n\nI agree it *should* be more native / standardized. Until there’s a real spec for agent execution (not just tool schemas), everyone’s either rolling wrappers or accepting scary permissions.\n\nCurious what level you’re aiming for locally:\n\n* human-in-the-loop approvals?\n* strict allowlists?\n* cost / rate enforcement?\n* or just “don’t nuke my data”?\n\nThat choice seems to drive everything else.",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** DeepSeek V3.2 scored 9.39 to beat GPT-5.2-Codex (9.20) and every other closed model on a complex coding task. But the real story is Claude Sonnet 4.5 got scored anywhere from 3.95 to 8.80 by different judges — same exact code.\n\n# The Test\n\nWe asked 10 models to write a production-grade nested JSON parser with:\n\n* Path syntax (\"user.profile.settings.theme\")\n* Array indexing (\"users\\[0\\].name\")\n* Circular reference detection\n* Typed results with error messages\n* Full type hints and docstrings\n\nThis is a real-world task. Every backend engineer has written something like this.\n\n# Results\n\n|Rank|Model|Score|Std Dev|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|**DeepSeek V3.2**|9.39|0.80|\n|2|GPT-5.2-Codex|9.20|0.50|\n|3|Grok 3|8.89|0.76|\n|4|Grok Code Fast 1|8.46|1.10|\n|5|Gemini 3 Flash|8.16|0.71|\n|6|Claude Opus 4.5|7.57|1.56|\n|7|Claude Sonnet 4.5|7.02|2.03|\n|8|Gemini 3 Pro|4.30|1.38|\n|9|GLM 4.7|2.91|3.61|\n|10|MiniMax M2.1|0.70|0.28|\n\n**Open weights won.** DeepSeek V3.2 is fully open.\n\n# The Variance Problem (responding to yesterday's feedback)\n\nToday's data supports this. Look at Claude Sonnet's std dev: **2.03**\n\nThat's a 5-point spread (3.95 to 8.80) on the same response. Judges fundamentally disagreed on what \"good\" means.\n\nCompare to GPT-5.2-Codex with 0.50 std dev — everyone agreed within \\~1 point.\n\nWhen evaluators disagree this much, the benchmark is under-specified.\n\n# Judge Strictness (meta-analysis)\n\n|Judge|Avg Score Given|\n|:-|:-|\n|Claude Opus 4.5|5.92 (strictest)|\n|Claude Sonnet 4.5|5.94|\n|GPT-5.2-Codex|6.07|\n|DeepSeek V3.2|7.88|\n|Gemini 3 Flash|9.11 (most lenient)|\n\nClaude models judge harshly but score mid-tier themselves. Interesting pattern.\n\n# What We're Adding (based on your feedback)\n\n**5 open-weight models for tomorrow:**\n\n1. Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\n2. Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct\n3. Mistral-Large-2411\n4. **Big-Tiger-Gemma-27B-v3** (u/ttkciar suggested this — anti-sycophancy finetune)\n5. Phi-4\n\n**New evaluation dimension:** We're adding \"reasoning justification\" scoring — did the model explain its approach, not just produce correct-looking output?\n\n# Methodology\n\nThis is The Multivac — daily 10×10 blind peer matrix:\n\n* 10 models respond to same question\n* Each model judges all 10 responses (100 total judgments)\n* Models don't know which response came from which model\n* Rankings from peer consensus, not single evaluator\n\nFull responses and analysis: [https://open.substack.com/pub/themultivac/p/deepseek-v32-wins-the-json-parsing?r=72olj0&utm\\_campaign=post&utm\\_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true](https://open.substack.com/pub/themultivac/p/deepseek-v32-wins-the-json-parsing?r=72olj0&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true)\n\n[themultivac.com](http://themultivac.com)\n\n**Questions welcome.

          "text": "You might enjoy this paper from 2024;\n\n> Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically improved their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often limit models to making only one attempt at a problem. Here, we explore inference compute as another axis for scaling, using the simple technique of repeatedly sampling candidate solutions from a model. Across multiple tasks and models, we observe that coverage -- the fraction of problems that are solved by any generated sample -- scales with the number of samples over four orders of magnitude. Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the number of samples is often log-linear and can be modelled with an exponentiated power law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. In domains like coding and formal proofs, where answers can be automatically verified, these increases in coverage directly translate into improved performance. When we apply repeated sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples, outperforming the single-sample state-of-the-art of 43%. In domains without automatic verifiers, we find that common methods for picking from a sample collection (majority voting and reward models) plateau beyond several hundred samples and fail to fully scale with the sample budget. \n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21787",

              "text": "I agree and will add that a 256gb m3 ultra runs most of the large open weight Chinese models at usable speeds. Mac can run larger models at usable speeds. Cuda runs smaller models faster. $50k H100s are 100gb roughly each. They are made to serve lots of requests simultaneously. A single person wanting better models can let some of that go to have infinite local access to those cloud models. \n\nIt's not just access to quality local as local really focuses on sovereignty. I can let local llms look through folders with sensitive information with my internet disconnected and even when connected I have the logs in front of me to see exactly what is being transmitted vs the black box from cloud providers.\n\nVs code with extensions and models like glm4.7 will feel like slower versions of cursor and claude code. It is still faster than I can read and anything going to prod should at least be skimmed. Managing context becomes the focus for performance locally so any tool that breaks the work down coupled with your own logical decomposition of your tasks will keep your model faster and make it more enjoyable. Glm4.7 sits in the 15-20t/s space on mac studio when context isnt too heavy but can crawl when context is heavy. \n\nCuda for any given vram amount is most expensive so consider what speed you personally need and have a model(s) in mind for what you buy. A $2k strix halo gets gpt-oss-120b at 50 tokens per second on small context prompt vs needing 3x 3090s ($4-5k) entry level cuda for models that can'tcode like the cloud. I would honestly recommend pairing something smaller and faster like gpt-oss120b and something bigger like glm4.7 so that you have the feeling of fast action vs slower more deliberate responses without having to reload models in between. Gpt-oss-120b on mac studio is like 75-85t/s I think vs 3-4 3090s is 100t/s vs strix halo is 50t/s. \n\nI keep gpt-oss-120b loaded for tool calls like internet searches and quick questions. Coding I use glm4.7/4.6, qwen3coder480b q3kxl and it's reap version from unsloth at q4kxl, and minimaxm2.1. \n\nFor $10k you could get the 512gb mac studio and run multiple models this way simultaneously. However 2x256gb ones can be clustered I think for really big models but then you'd have two sets of processors with 512gb vram instead of one cpu and one gpu handling multiple calls simultaneously.  Now we're multitasking. You could speed up glm4.7 locally or have two of them at once or pair with a smaller faster model like minimax m2.1... $10k leaves you a lot of options to consider.\n\nLast thing, people bash locally hosted models. Im telling you I fight with cloud models like chatgpt and gemini on some tasks that I can give to my local glm4.7 or even gpt-oss-120b and get what I want the first time. The cloud has lots going on behind the scenes and they tune the models for their inference patterns and experience they want you to have. You can have more control to tune to what you want locally but it will take more effort to have a really good experience.",

That is more so the under $1000 usd build before buying gpus. Can always get a better workstation later and buy more gpus.

It is expensive but the best value for money and the best performance per watt. I received it a few days ago, inserted it in my desktop PC (a modest Ryzen 5 9600x with 32Gb DDR5 RAM) and the experience has been nothing short of amazing. This thing is a beast (Qwen3-coder-30B: \\~200 tokens/sec) and if you're doing just inference, it is perfectly silent, the fans barely spin, you can have it next to you. Why the Max-Q (300W) and not the regular 600W version? Because even if you lose 15% performance (in inference), you get a silent card that you can use next to you today and use with other cards in a workstation if you wish to expand in the future. Why not a RTX 5090? Too little memory for the models I want to run, and its price is way too inflated right now.",

I was waiting for the 5070Ti Super 24Gb to be release to buy one, but the ram shortage situation made me buy a 16gb in a hurry.  \nObviously I can't load as big of models in vram as I was expecting (and RTX 4090 and 5090 are too expensive) but I thought that maybe it was possible  to add a second GPU like a second hand 24gb RTX3090 or a RTX 5060 16gb in order to use the vram of that second GPU in addition to the vram of the first one? (so Vram from GPU 1+2 would be seen as just one big capacity) Is it possible to do that? If yes, how? I'm using LM Studio\n\nWhat would be best between a 3090 (24Gb) and 5060 Ti (16gb)? I know there's more vram in the 3090 but maybe i\\_t's less fitted for AI than a more recent 5060 Ti?\n\nThanks",

I'm sure someone will come here to talk about how Ampere lacks fp8 or nvfp4, but if you don't absolutely need these two formats natively supported, the 3090 wins in everything else. It has 50% more VRAM and 100% more memory bandwidth. The former lets you load bigger models, and if you have more than one 3090 there's less waste in VRAM (that's mainly a software deficiency in current inference engines). The memory bandwidth means more of the compute is accessible more of the time.\n\nThe 5070ti is abice the 3090 in terms of compute, and practically has the same memory bandwidth. So, think of the 3090 as a second 5070ti with 50% more VRAM.\n\nGenerally speaking, moar VRAM is moar better. I'd even sell the 5070Ti since that is more expensive than the 3090 where I live and put the money towards getting two 3090s. 48GB  >> 32GB VRAM.",

It also supports Ollama and llama cpp . Give it a try and consider implementing it in your system — you might like it!

Some key bits:\n\n> The documentation for HashIndex identifies it as a \"vectorless\" index system. This characterization is central to its \"under the hood\" operations. Instead of calculating a mathematical hash or a vector embedding, the system invokes an LLM to generate what it terms a \"semantic hash key\".  \n\n> When a document is ingested by HashIndex, it is first split into segments or pages. For each segment, the system initiates a dual-process LLM call. The first process involves generating a highly descriptive, human-readable label that encapsulates the core theme of the content. This label—for example, ``revenue_projections_FY2024_Q3``—serves as the index key in the hash map. The second process generates a concise summary of the page.\n\n> This \"single-pass\" parsing allows the document to be structured for retrieval without the need for pre-computed embedding datasets. However, the cost of this precision is time. While a traditional cryptographic hash function $H(x)$ or an embedding model can process data in milliseconds, the semantic key generation in HashIndex requires significant inference time, typically 2 to 3 seconds per page.\n\n[...]\n\n> In HashIndex, the hash table is implemented in-memory, allowing for rapid access once the indexing phase is complete. The \"hash function\" in this context is the cognitive process performed by the LLM during key generation. This approach eliminates the need for complex tree rebalancing and multi-level traversal required by systems like ChatIndex or PageIndex. However, it places a higher burden on the \"agentic\" side of the retrieval process, as the agent must now navigate a flat list of keys rather than a hierarchical tree. \n\nDoes this look like an accurate summary of how it works? Might be worth calling out that the \"hash\" in this case is not a traditional hash in the way that word is usually meant, but an LLM-generated semantic \"tag\" of sorts.",
