Then depending on what else they want built the price jumps significantly. Orchestration agents - SwarmAI - Automations - if they need media generated for ads with brand AI influencers (we’re technically an ad agency first so we run ads primarily but now with AI we also sell AI solutions) - basically I’ve set it up where you pick your niche, roofer, dentist, med spa, law firm etc and we come in and sell you the foundation $10k then offer the “HQ Pro” (what I ended up calling them) and those have a ton of agentic infrastructure and automations designed specifically for those niches. Also clients can build a custom infrastructure which is more bespoke to what they need it to do and be for their business. The HQ Pro’s are about $25k+ and a full custom bespoke build is about… well… I actually just raised my prices so it’s now $69,000 (use to be $35k starting and increase based on scope of what we’re building) and I might raise them again to $100,000 because the idea is we’re replacing 1 employee salary and building a infrastructure that can run your whole business for you potentially replacing 100s of employees. At least that’s how I pitch it. I say “close your eyes, imagine what you want this thing to do for you, okay now let’s build it.” But yea, fun times.",

I posted stats of a test done going up to 100k context and the spark just cannot, will not be able to do those speeds EVEN with 2x sparks.\n\nThat being said, exo’ing these two seems like its going to be a new niche class of being able to combine the two to do exactly that and have each other make up for its own weaknesses, amazing.",

              "text": "My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is",

If so that would indeed not make any difference because pcie speed is only important in cross GPU communication (moreover the 5060 ti is limited to pcie 5.0 x8 anyway).  \n  \nAdditionaly pcie 4.0 x4 is not plenty at all for inference you would get massive speed ups by using pcie 5.0 x4 (or better but talking within the constraints of your set up) and tensor parrallelism in VLLM  (especially on prompt processing).\n\nPlease do not use Ollama, this is such a nice and neat set up, don't waste it on Ollama...",

So permissions end up living either:\n\n* inside prompts (brittle),\n* inside per-tool wrappers (boilerplate explosion),\n* or at the MCP server boundary (coarse, hard to reason about).\n\nThe isolation vs over-permission tradeoff you mention is exactly what happens when there’s no **deny-by-default execution layer** sitting *between* the model and the tools.\n\nWhat’s worked best for us locally is:\n\n* keep MCP servers dumb (pure capability exposure)\n* move auth, cost limits, logging, and allow/deny decisions into a single runtime gate\n* treat every tool call as an auditable event, not “just another function call”\n\nThat way you’re not re-implementing auth + logging per connector, and you’re not trusting the model to behave just because the prompt says so.\n\nI agree it *should* be more native / standardized. Until there’s a real spec for agent execution (not just tool schemas), everyone’s either rolling wrappers or accepting scary permissions.\n\nCurious what level you’re aiming for locally:\n\n* human-in-the-loop approvals?\n* strict allowlists?\n* cost / rate enforcement?\n* or just “don’t nuke my data”?\n\nThat choice seems to drive everything else.",

      "text": "**The Case for a $600 Local LLM Machine**\n\nUsing the Base Model Mac mini M4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5c916gwucoeg1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d91da71f6244d752e15922e47dfbf9d792beb1\n\nby Tony Thomas\n\nIt started as a simple experiment. How much real work could I do on a small, inexpensive machine running language models locally?\n\nWith GPU prices still elevated, memory costs climbing, SSD prices rising instead of falling, power costs steadily increasing, and cloud subscriptions adding up, it felt like a question worth answering. After a lot of thought and testing, the system I landed on was a base model Mac mini M4 with 16 GB of unified memory, a 256 GB internal SSD, a USB-C dock, and a 1 TB external NVMe drive for model storage. Thanks to recent sales, the all-in cost came in right around $600.\n\nOn paper, that does not sound like much. In practice, it turned out to be far more capable than I expected.\n\nLocal LLM work has shifted over the last couple of years. Models are more efficient due to better training and optimization. Quantization is better understood. Inference engines are faster and more stable. At the same time, the hardware market has moved in the opposite direction. GPUs with meaningful amounts of VRAM are expensive, and large VRAM models are quietly disappearing. DRAM is no longer cheap. SSD and NVMe prices have climbed sharply.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, a compact system with tightly integrated silicon starts to look less like a compromise and more like a sensible baseline.\n\n**Why the Mac mini M4 Works**\n\nThe M4 Mac mini stands out because Apple’s unified memory architecture fundamentally changes how a small system behaves under inference workloads. CPU and GPU draw from the same high-bandwidth memory pool, avoiding the awkward juggling act that defines entry-level discrete GPU setups. I am not interested in cramming models into a narrow VRAM window while system memory sits idle. The M4 simply uses what it has efficiently.\n\nSixteen gigabytes is not generous, but it is workable when that memory is fast and shared. For the kinds of tasks I care about, brainstorming, writing, editing, summarization, research, and outlining, it holds up well. I spend my time working, not managing resources.\n\nThe 256 GB internal SSD is limited, but not a dealbreaker. Models and data live on the external NVMe drive, which is fast enough that it does not slow my workflow. The internal disk handles macOS and applications, and that is all it needs to do. Avoiding Apple’s storage upgrade pricing was an easy decision.\n\nThe setup itself is straightforward. No unsupported hardware. No hacks. No fragile dependencies. It is dependable, UNIX-based, and boring in the best way. That matters if you intend to use the machine every day rather than treat it as a side project.\n\n**What Daily Use Looks Like**\n\nThe real test was whether the machine stayed out of my way.\n\nQuantized 7B and 8B models run smoothly using Ollama and LM Studio. AnythingLLM works well too and adds vector databases and seamless access to cloud models when needed. Response times are short enough that interaction feels conversational rather than mechanical. I can draft, revise, and iterate without waiting on the system, which makes local use genuinely viable.\n\nLarger 13B to 14B models are more usable than I expected when configured sensibly. Context size needs to be managed, but that is true even on far more expensive systems. For single-user workflows, the experience is consistent and predictable.\n\nWhat stood out most was how quickly the hardware stopped being the limiting factor. Once the models were loaded and tools configured, I forgot I was using a constrained system. That is the point where performance stops being theoretical and starts being practical.\n\nIn daily use, I rotate through a familiar mix of models. Qwen variants from 1.7B up through 14B do most of the work, alongside Mistral instruct models, DeepSeek 8B, Phi-4, and Gemma. On this machine, smaller Qwen models routinely exceed 30 tokens per second and often land closer to 40 TPS depending on quantization and context. These smaller models can usually take advantage of the full available context without issue.\n\nThe 7B to 8B class typically runs in the low to mid 20s at context sizes between 4K and 16K. Larger 13B to 14B models settle into the low teens at a conservative 4K context and operate near the upper end of acceptable memory pressure. Those numbers are not headline-grabbing, but they are fast enough that writing, editing, and iteration feel fluid rather than constrained. I am rarely waiting on the model, which is the only metric that actually matters for my workflow.\n\n**Cost, Power, and Practicality**\n\nAt roughly $600, this system occupies an important middle ground. It costs less than a capable GPU-based desktop while delivering enough performance to replace a meaningful amount of cloud usage. Over time, that matters more than peak benchmarks.\n\nThe Mac mini M4 is also extremely efficient. It draws very little power under sustained inference loads, runs silently, and requires no special cooling or placement. I routinely leave models running all day without thinking about the electric bill.\n\nThat stands in sharp contrast to my Ryzen 5700G desktop paired with an Intel B50 GPU. That system pulls hundreds of watts under load, with the B50 alone consuming around 50 watts during LLM inference. Over time, that difference is not theoretical. It shows up directly in operating costs.\n\nThe M4 sits on top of my tower system and behaves more like an appliance. Thanks to my use of a KVM, I can turn off the desktop entirely and keep working. I do not think about heat, noise, or power consumption. That simplicity lowers friction and makes local models something I reach for by default, not as an occasional experiment.\n\n**Where the Limits Are**\n\nThe constraints are real but manageable. Memory is finite, and there is no upgrade path. Model selection and context size require discipline. This is an inference-first system, not a training platform.\n\nApple Silicon also brings ecosystem boundaries. If your work depends on CUDA-specific tooling or experimental research code, this is not the right machine. It relies on Apple’s Metal backend rather than NVIDIA’s stack. My focus is writing and knowledge work, and for that, the platform fits extremely well.\n\n**Why This Feels Like a Turning Point**\n\nWhat surprised me was not that the Mac mini M4 could run local LLMs. It was how well it could run them given the constraints.\n\nFor years, local AI was framed as something that required large amounts of RAM, a powerful CPU, and an expensive GPU. These systems were loud, hot, and power hungry, built primarily for enthusiasts. This setup points in a different direction. With efficient models and tightly integrated hardware, a small, affordable system can do real work.\n\nFor writers, researchers, and independent developers who care about control, privacy, and predictable costs, a budget local LLM machine built around the Mac mini M4 no longer feels experimental. It is something I turn on in the morning, leave running all day, and rely on without thinking about the hardware.\n\nMore than any benchmark, that is what matters.\n\nFrom: tonythomas-dot-net",

          "text": "If you don't already have an important research idea to follow, distilling a larger model down to a non quadratic architecture is probably the highest impact you can have. \n\nIf you have an experiment to run, make sure it's solid first.\n\nIf you will allow me a moment to self promote, I have this https://github.com/bigwolfeman/TitanMAC-Standalone an implementation from a series of Google papers. I haven't worked out all the kinks and performance elements yet, but you can take the neural memory module and use it on any other architecture as a replacement for quadratic attention. The kernels are there for forward and back passes. I'd prefer if you contributed to this project though =) you'd be working through issues either way if you took the neural memory just as a factor of writing your own architecture. \n\nThere is a potential issue with the sliding window required for the neural memory, you may have chunk boundary issues. From my testing I have this resolved, but I haven't gone past 50k steps on it yet to make sure it doesn't crop up again later.\n\nI also submitted this to the hackathon for this subreddit https://github.com/bigwolfeman/Retnet-Distillation \n\nI do not recommend using retnet for this. It is extremely unstable and slow. I had to patch torchscale just to make it work at all and kept finding issues in torchscale. But there is a nice reference implementation of keeping the teacher in vram beside the student, caching it's logits to disk, or inferencing from a vllm server and exposing top k logits.\n\nEven with how unstable retention is, it may be worth implementing to resolve chunk boundary problems. I am currently not maintaining retention in TitanMAC, but if further testing shows issues I'm planning to use it.\n\nAlso, my repo has the nested learning module based on SGD. It is a memory efficient optimizer. Allowing for more parameters with less vram. \n\nIf you're interested in using this repo, reach out to me. I have a branch I am doing a lot of development work on. I have found that feeding in hyper connections directly to the nested optimizer gives it richer signals for convergence and is basically free to do. It may be possible to average gradient heuristics to 16x16 tiles using my development branch, but I haven't had time to test this yet. It is the last step of the dynamic sparse implementation I'm working on in that branch. \n\n---\n\nOther great use for so much vram: distill a VLM to V-JEPA.\nDistill to HOPE https://github.com/Sk16er/hope_nano HOPE is a vram monster, I don't think this architecture is ready to scale yet, but it's research value is tremendous.\n\nEdit: the custom kernels are targeting blackwell, but they're written in Triton. Getting them ready for an h100 shouldn't be too bad.\n\nIf this deployment you want to do is far enough out in the future, I am planning on implementing the entire architecture in mojo for further performance gains. I'm still ablating several takes on the sparsity before I do this. The current code isn't designed to shard across gpus, though pytorch makes it fairly easy. Mojo is very good at sharing, though I haven't tested that myself.",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** DeepSeek V3.2 scored 9.39 to beat GPT-5.2-Codex (9.20) and every other closed model on a complex coding task. But the real story is Claude Sonnet 4.5 got scored anywhere from 3.95 to 8.80 by different judges — same exact code.\n\n# The Test\n\nWe asked 10 models to write a production-grade nested JSON parser with:\n\n* Path syntax (\"user.profile.settings.theme\")\n* Array indexing (\"users\\[0\\].name\")\n* Circular reference detection\n* Typed results with error messages\n* Full type hints and docstrings\n\nThis is a real-world task. Every backend engineer has written something like this.\n\n# Results\n\n|Rank|Model|Score|Std Dev|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|**DeepSeek V3.2**|9.39|0.80|\n|2|GPT-5.2-Codex|9.20|0.50|\n|3|Grok 3|8.89|0.76|\n|4|Grok Code Fast 1|8.46|1.10|\n|5|Gemini 3 Flash|8.16|0.71|\n|6|Claude Opus 4.5|7.57|1.56|\n|7|Claude Sonnet 4.5|7.02|2.03|\n|8|Gemini 3 Pro|4.30|1.38|\n|9|GLM 4.7|2.91|3.61|\n|10|MiniMax M2.1|0.70|0.28|\n\n**Open weights won.** DeepSeek V3.2 is fully open.\n\n# The Variance Problem (responding to yesterday's feedback)\n\nToday's data supports this. Look at Claude Sonnet's std dev: **2.03**\n\nThat's a 5-point spread (3.95 to 8.80) on the same response. Judges fundamentally disagreed on what \"good\" means.\n\nCompare to GPT-5.2-Codex with 0.50 std dev — everyone agreed within \\~1 point.\n\nWhen evaluators disagree this much, the benchmark is under-specified.\n\n# Judge Strictness (meta-analysis)\n\n|Judge|Avg Score Given|\n|:-|:-|\n|Claude Opus 4.5|5.92 (strictest)|\n|Claude Sonnet 4.5|5.94|\n|GPT-5.2-Codex|6.07|\n|DeepSeek V3.2|7.88|\n|Gemini 3 Flash|9.11 (most lenient)|\n\nClaude models judge harshly but score mid-tier themselves. Interesting pattern.\n\n# What We're Adding (based on your feedback)\n\n**5 open-weight models for tomorrow:**\n\n1. Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\n2. Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct\n3. Mistral-Large-2411\n4. **Big-Tiger-Gemma-27B-v3** (u/ttkciar suggested this — anti-sycophancy finetune)\n5. Phi-4\n\n**New evaluation dimension:** We're adding \"reasoning justification\" scoring — did the model explain its approach, not just produce correct-looking output?\n\n# Methodology\n\nThis is The Multivac — daily 10×10 blind peer matrix:\n\n* 10 models respond to same question\n* Each model judges all 10 responses (100 total judgments)\n* Models don't know which response came from which model\n* Rankings from peer consensus, not single evaluator\n\nFull responses and analysis: [https://open.substack.com/pub/themultivac/p/deepseek-v32-wins-the-json-parsing?r=72olj0&utm\\_campaign=post&utm\\_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true](https://open.substack.com/pub/themultivac/p/deepseek-v32-wins-the-json-parsing?r=72olj0&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true)\n\n[themultivac.com](http://themultivac.com)\n\n**Questions welcome.

          "text": "You might enjoy this paper from 2024;\n\n> Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically improved their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often limit models to making only one attempt at a problem. Here, we explore inference compute as another axis for scaling, using the simple technique of repeatedly sampling candidate solutions from a model. Across multiple tasks and models, we observe that coverage -- the fraction of problems that are solved by any generated sample -- scales with the number of samples over four orders of magnitude. Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the number of samples is often log-linear and can be modelled with an exponentiated power law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. In domains like coding and formal proofs, where answers can be automatically verified, these increases in coverage directly translate into improved performance. When we apply repeated sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples, outperforming the single-sample state-of-the-art of 43%. In domains without automatic verifiers, we find that common methods for picking from a sample collection (majority voting and reward models) plateau beyond several hundred samples and fail to fully scale with the sample budget. \n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21787",

              "text": "I agree and will add that a 256gb m3 ultra runs most of the large open weight Chinese models at usable speeds. Mac can run larger models at usable speeds. Cuda runs smaller models faster. $50k H100s are 100gb roughly each. They are made to serve lots of requests simultaneously. A single person wanting better models can let some of that go to have infinite local access to those cloud models. \n\nIt's not just access to quality local as local really focuses on sovereignty. I can let local llms look through folders with sensitive information with my internet disconnected and even when connected I have the logs in front of me to see exactly what is being transmitted vs the black box from cloud providers.\n\nVs code with extensions and models like glm4.7 will feel like slower versions of cursor and claude code. It is still faster than I can read and anything going to prod should at least be skimmed. Managing context becomes the focus for performance locally so any tool that breaks the work down coupled with your own logical decomposition of your tasks will keep your model faster and make it more enjoyable. Glm4.7 sits in the 15-20t/s space on mac studio when context isnt too heavy but can crawl when context is heavy. \n\nCuda for any given vram amount is most expensive so consider what speed you personally need and have a model(s) in mind for what you buy. A $2k strix halo gets gpt-oss-120b at 50 tokens per second on small context prompt vs needing 3x 3090s ($4-5k) entry level cuda for models that can'tcode like the cloud. I would honestly recommend pairing something smaller and faster like gpt-oss120b and something bigger like glm4.7 so that you have the feeling of fast action vs slower more deliberate responses without having to reload models in between. Gpt-oss-120b on mac studio is like 75-85t/s I think vs 3-4 3090s is 100t/s vs strix halo is 50t/s. \n\nI keep gpt-oss-120b loaded for tool calls like internet searches and quick questions. Coding I use glm4.7/4.6, qwen3coder480b q3kxl and it's reap version from unsloth at q4kxl, and minimaxm2.1. \n\nFor $10k you could get the 512gb mac studio and run multiple models this way simultaneously. However 2x256gb ones can be clustered I think for really big models but then you'd have two sets of processors with 512gb vram instead of one cpu and one gpu handling multiple calls simultaneously.  Now we're multitasking. You could speed up glm4.7 locally or have two of them at once or pair with a smaller faster model like minimax m2.1... $10k leaves you a lot of options to consider.\n\nLast thing, people bash locally hosted models. Im telling you I fight with cloud models like chatgpt and gemini on some tasks that I can give to my local glm4.7 or even gpt-oss-120b and get what I want the first time. The cloud has lots going on behind the scenes and they tune the models for their inference patterns and experience they want you to have. You can have more control to tune to what you want locally but it will take more effort to have a really good experience.",

It is expensive but the best value for money and the best performance per watt. I received it a few days ago, inserted it in my desktop PC (a modest Ryzen 5 9600x with 32Gb DDR5 RAM) and the experience has been nothing short of amazing. This thing is a beast (Qwen3-coder-30B: \\~200 tokens/sec) and if you're doing just inference, it is perfectly silent, the fans barely spin, you can have it next to you. Why the Max-Q (300W) and not the regular 600W version? Because even if you lose 15% performance (in inference), you get a silent card that you can use next to you today and use with other cards in a workstation if you wish to expand in the future. Why not a RTX 5090? Too little memory for the models I want to run, and its price is way too inflated right now.",

This was tested in OpenCode.\n\nThis comes after extensive research into lesser-known models that significantly outperform what most LLM users seem to be using. Even so, the experience remains far from ideal.\n\nMy conclusion: the practical minimum for serious work is around 36GB of VRAM. The reason is context.\n\nSufficient context is essential for the model to genuinely understand your project and operate coherently within it. For coding tasks, you want as much context as possible—and at 256K tokens, you're looking at roughly 16GB of VRAM for the KV cache alone, before accounting for the model weights. This assumes aggressive quantization (q8/q4). You'd need even more if you're not willing to sacrifice quality here (20-40GB).\n\nCPU offloading is technically possible, but latency scales catastrophically as context fills; waiting an hour per prompt is simply untenable for agentic workflows.\n\nProcessing speed further constrains your options, effectively limiting you to MoE architectures with small activation sizes.\n\nThe only models in this class that handle tool calls reliably in my experience are at or exceed 30B total parameters. \n\nThe practical minimum I've found is Unsloth's T1 quant of Qwen 3 Next 80-A3B, which requires just over 20GB on its own.\n\nIn sum: 32GB is workable if you're willing to compromise on context. Otherwise, you're looking at 36GB—which means either multi-GPU configurations or stepping up to professional-grade hardware.",

You can get away with 160GB VRAM before the model becomes braindead due to quantization.\n\nFinally, at 448GB you can run lightly quantized DeepSeek 671B models with great results.\n\nIn general, coding performance degrades quickly with quantization, and **Q4\\_K or INT4 are not good enough!** The smaller the model, the more it is affected by quantization. For example, Kimi-K2 is usable with all the experts quantized as 4 bit. But the same is not true for MiniMax-M2.",

No token limits and depending on number of GPUs and VRAM, could be cheap enough per hour. \n\nWould need some effort up front to make it resilient so when a spot instance goes down. It fires up another in a different family.  But it's possible.\n\nAnsible or whatever config tool would need to setup the ai infra (vllm / ollama) and pull the model required.\n\nTrash the instance when done for the day as can fire up another next time.  \n\nOption B) Fine tuning smaller model for specific use case.\n\nThis is the one I will be testing in short term. I am an Oracle Developer (25 years) in a niche vertical (Retail).  Plsql is present in foundation models but it's most likely from stack overflow or a side effect.  Haven't found anywhere it's part of primary training set.  \n\nIf I ask copilot to create a plsql function, it will have a go but results are mixed.  If it had currency conversion, it doesn't know I have a STD function for that.  It doesn't know all my package functions returna Boolean and an error_msg variable.  So the suggestions all need amending.\n\nIf I fine tune for my niche code, then I should be able to have a much better experience than foundation models (TBC by testing).",

This post is a pure example of what I keep meaning when I talk about the massive amount of people trying to jump into AI without slightly even caring to learn to basics.\n\n512 gb.\n\nIf you think i’m exaggerating and think anything under 256 gb will be useable, you have way too much to learn.\n\nGLM 4.7 which is already not even as smart as GPT 5.2 or sonnet 4.5 requires a bare bare minimum of 256 gb of vram, and even with 256 gb of vram it will be dumbed down and slow. \n\nIntelligence is exponential, meaning a 3b model will not be 1/10th the intelligence of a 30b model. It will be much lower than 1/10th. You can try to run 30b models or even 120b models as much as you want, but what makes it even worse is that for the technically unskilled, you need a model that is as smart as possible to make up for your gaps in knowledge.\n\nThe strongest point of LLMs is that is allows us humans for recursive learning. Beginner sets up LLM. Beginner asks LLM how to use it agentically. Beginner uses agentic LLM to code and ask further questions on how to code and so on. But for this to work you need actual passion and motivation, and thats not something that can be given, nor created.\n\nIf you are asking this question then you are not ready and do not have the motivation to get into this because if you did you would have already figured this part out.",

Nemo edges out Llama 3.1 8B on reasoning without being too wordy, and folks use it daily for email drafts and task categorization just like you want.​\n\nPaste project text, say \"summarize this for a team mtg, suggest 3 action items\" or \"rewrite this email to sound more collaborative\"—hits 20-40 t/s easy.

I recently tested it out and it has so many cool features. The one that stood out to me was how easy it was to choose diff types of graphic elements within the tool. For the slides, I gave my notes to Claude and asked it clean them up and structure them as slides. It did so and then I fed that into Gamma to build a presentation for me.\n\n  \n2. A productivity tip: I use voice dictation a lot. When I have lots of thoughts and context, I use dictation to feed AI. Be it drafting a long (and important) email, creating an SOP, or similar comms or documentation work, this saves me a lot of time. Also, I don't know the reason, but the results are so much better than when I type instructions. I am a decent writer so proofreading and editing doesn't take me long. Overall, this process works well for me so I definitely recommend testing it.",

They mean “best general-purpose chat without needing extra tool wiring.”\n\nClaude: Anthropic’s models.\n\nGrok: xAI’s model.\n\n\n3) What the jargon means\n\n“Local”: you run the model yourself (privacy, control, but you manage setup + performance).\n\n“Websearch”: hooking the model to a browsing/search tool so it can fetch current info instead of guessing.\n\n“Memory files”: usually means a RAG setup (retrieval-augmented generation): your notes/docs are indexed and the model can pull relevant chunks while answering.\n\n“Big leagues”: basically “best-of-the-best overall.”\n\n“Standalone”: not using tool integrations, agents, RAG, custom workflows—just the model as-is.\n\n“Claude MCP”: almost certainly referring to the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—a way to connect Claude to external tools/services (files, apps, search, automations) in a standardized way.\n\n“Cutthroat / win is a win”: the model will prioritize getting some answer that seems successful, even if it’s not cautious or perfectly aligned with your intent/rules.\n\n“Bend the rules / go around problems”: meaning it may produce confident outputs, shortcuts, or “creative” leaps that sound right but aren’t reliably grounded.\n\n“Wary of long memory and brainstorming without checks”: don’t let it build long chains of assumptions over time; verify with sources, logs, or constraints.\n\n\n4) Why it reads incoherent\n\nIt’s basically:\n\nmissing punctuation,\n\ntypos (“but u f you Claude mcp…” = “but if you use Claude MCP…”),\n\nand it jumps between local model advice and hosted model opinions without transitions.\n\n\nIf you tell me what you were trying to decide (local vs cloud, privacy, work tasks, hardware), I can translate their advice into a concrete recommendation that fits your situation.\"",
