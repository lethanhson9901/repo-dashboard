      "text": "After 3 weeks of deep work, I''ve realized agents are so un predictable that are basically useless for any professional use. This is what I've found:\n\nLet's exclude the instructions that must be clear, effective and not ambiguos. Possibly with few shot examples (but not always!)\n\n1) Every model requires a system prompt carefully crafted with instructions styled  as similar as its training set. (Where do you find it? No idea)\nSame prompt with different model causes different results and performances. \nLesson learned: once you find a style that workish, better you stay with that model family.\n\n2) Inference parameters: that's is pure alchemy. time consuming of trial and error. (If you change model,  be ready to start all over again). No comment on this.\n\n3) system prompt  length: if you are too descriptive at best you inject a strong bias in the agent, at worst the model just forget some parts of it.\nIf you are too short model hallucinates.\nGood luck in finding the sweet spot, and still, you cross the fingers every time you run the agent. \nThis connect me to the next point...\n\n4) dense or MOE model? \nDense model are much better in keeping context (especially system instructions), but they are slow.\nMoE are fast, but during the experts activation not always the context is passed correctly among them. The \"not always\" makes me crazy.\nSo again you get different responses  based on I don't know what.! Pretty sure that are some obscure parameters as well...\nHope Qwen next will fix this.\n\n5) RAG and KGraphs? Fascinating but that's another field of science. Another deeeepp rabbit hole I don't even want to talk about now.\n\n6) Text to SQL?  You have to pray, a lot. Either you end up manually coding the commands and give it as tool, or be ready for disaster. And that is a BIG pity, since DB are very much used in any business.( Yeah yeah. Table description data types etc...already tried) \n\n7) you want reliability? Then go for structured input and output! Atomicity of tasks!\nI got to the point that between the problem decomposition to a level that the agent can manage it (reliably) and the construction of a structured input/output chain, the level of effort required makes me wonder what is this hype about AI? Or at least home AI.  (and I have a Ryzen AI max 395).\n\n\nAnd still after all the efforts you always have this feeling: will it work this time? \nAgentic shit is far far away from YouTube demos and frameworks examples.\nSome people creates Frankenstein systems, where even naming the combination they are using is too long,.but hey it works!! Question is \"for how long\"? \nWhat's gonna be deprecated or updated on the next version of one of your parts?\n\nWhat I've learned is that if you want to make something professional and reliable, (especially if you are being paid for it) better to use good old deterministic code, and as less dependencies as possible. Put here and there some LLM calls for those task where NLP is necessary because coding all conditions would take forever.\n\nNonetheless I do  believe, that in the end, the magical equilibrium of all parameters and prompts and shit must exist. And while I search for that sweet spot, I hope that local models will keep improving and making our life way simpler.\n\nJust for the curious: I've tried every possible model until gpt OSS 120b, Framework AGNO. Inference with LMstudio and Ollama (I'm on Windows, no vllm).\n\n \n\n\n\n",

Regardless, you need to see who might want pizza in your community. That means you need to pick the cheese and flour, but the pizza wholesale company won't sell you just 10 pounds of it. They want a contract for 300 pounds a week and then they'll talk.\n\nSo you buy Walmart cheese and call your neighbor, but the test is inconclusive. The project can never move forward without high risk of capital and doing the whole pizza store thing and just opening up with the supplies you think are right.\n\nFor the LLM, it means you have to throw heavy hardware or high capital, lots of time, and lots of tests into something that might never be profitable for business or affordable for home hobbies.\n\nYou don't know until you add up the unpredictable costs while you tested and played with prompts for a week to a year.

It's the graph that shows a sharp peak that rises from the noise floor to a 50 dB signal. It can be tweaked in version 2, but you broke through the barrier.\n\nEverything LLM is like this - very hit or very miss. I've seen the video series by [https://www.youtube.com/@aiwarehouse](https://www.youtube.com/@aiwarehouse) AI Warehouse that bears this out, as well.

There will be so many iterations of AI improvements, PC hardware improvements, and refinements in the interface that the LLM of 2036 will be nothing like an LLM of 2026. Early adopters have so many disadvantages.\n\nThis stuff will be cheaper and faster in ten years. At current tech level and my current interest level, I think an adequate system, for just my personal use (With an eye to selling it), would cost $500 to $2000 per month and would need a new Internet connection. The current software may seem bloated when you download it, but the interfaces of today are simply a kludge and a Jack-of-all-trades that does nothing right except maybe answer chat questions a 6th grader might ask.\n\nAsk a current LLM about a dataset, and you're going to get terrible results. Even commercial systems stink. All you have to do is call into a Big Company and ask for tech support. The human agents are typing things into an AI, you can tell, and trying to bring up internal PDFs to answer your question and walk you through a solution.\n\nBecause their innate human knowledge is practically nil. They read from a script like phone agents have done for 40 years, but they are reading from hallucinated AI slop or the wrong PDF that's from 4 versions earlier that do not apply. LLMs have not taught Tier 1 support personnel how to think, and they certainly haven't trained them on the specifics of the things they are supporting.\n\nIf Fortune 100 companies can't figure out how to get AI to work to help their customers at Tier 1 (and their bottom line making money), I find it ridiculous to assume that a one-man-shop could figure it out.\n\nI wish all of you programmers, content creators, and schoolkids doing homework all the best! For the rest of us, it's hard to go full-in to this mess, for all of the reasons OP stated, starting at #1 and on down the list.\n\nBravo.",

The mistake most frameworks make is trying to hide the logic inside complex abstractions or 'black box' prompts.\n\nI’ve shifted to an 'agent-as-code' approach where the LLM is just a tool inside a strictly typed (TS) function. Instead of praying for a prompt to work, you manage the state and logic in code, and only use the LLM for the 'messy' NLP parts. It’s much easier to debug when you have a managed runtime that shows you the exact state and execution trace at every step.\n\nReliability doesn't come from better prompts; it comes from better infrastructure that treats agents like software, not like magic.",

The problem is that they are often used in roles that require deterministic behavior. When an LLM is treated as a probabilistic component within a deterministic system - for example, wrapped in agent-as-code patterns, strict input/output schemas, typed interfaces, and explicit checkpoints - most reliability issues are significantly reduced.\n\nAt that stage, the primary challenges shift away from prompt design or model choice and toward system architecture: managing latency, defining clear boundaries, and deciding which parts of the system are allowed to make judgments versus which must remain deterministic.",

A master woodworker will be far more proficient with a hammer then Joe Smoe that just picked up a hammer from Harborfreight for the first time ever. Different tools, different skill sets.\n\nb.) Right tool for the job. For some jobs these tools are either the wrong tools or just not worth the time/cost. Just as it's sometimes just faster to do something yourself then explain to someone else what you want so they can do it for you.\n\nc.) There can be a huge difference in quality between 'cheap' tools and 'expensive' tools. In this case you're using tiny models locally, even the 120B quantized is not going to compare well to the big unquantized models. For SQL see: [https://llm-benchmark.tinybird.live/](https://llm-benchmark.tinybird.live/)\n\nd.) You need to know the answer, always with LLM. If you don't, you're in for a world of hurt in a professional production environment. And SQL queries in a production environment seem to *me* like probably the worst possible use of LLM.\n\ne.) People need to realize that at what point are you spending more time=money on LLM then actually making your work more efficient?\n\nSidenote: I have not yet used LLM in my professional capacity. Primary reason is that I tend to work on the edge of IT deployment, and the LLMs haven't been trained yet on the use cases I'm working on and the edge cases that are very rare. Not to mention that even IF the LLM is trained on the 'promotional' material, the reason I'm doing my thing is to see if what's been sold to the client actually works as the sales people say it does (and it often does not)... The other reason is that the companies/clients I work for either do not allow LLM or have not yet onboarded it. And when I work for a client, I only use what they have allowed.\n\nPersonally I've tested quite a bit on a Mac Mini M4 Pro 64GB with models up to 70b, mostly for hobby projects. The results from there is that while very cool and the DS 70b model was better then the far larger GPT from less then a year before, still the unquantized far larger models we can't run locally did far, far better. And due to it being for my hobby projects, I saw no security concerns to *not* use the larger models (for free) on the web. Even the DS 671b model *quantized* on a $10k Mac Studio M3 Ultra 512GB gave worse quality responses then the full unquantized free model you could use on the Internet. Spending $50k on a Mac Studio cluster would be cool, but imho highly inefficient.",

Why would I need AI to make a CRUD?   \nIn real life and for the local LLMs available right now, there are very few problems they can really help and do things we couldn't do with traditional programming... for example, telling the AI to choose the comments that are related to some topic (when we don't already have categorization or tagging, because if we do, that's far more reliable... but if we don't have a categorization system already implemented, that is a new \"superpower\" we now have.\n\nI also liked OP's post a lot, great post and REAL lessons.",

It works fine for simple tasks and tool calls, but as soon as it gets slightly more complex, it's not even worth the effort to write the prompt and wait for its output, it's quicker to just code it myself. \n\nThat said, I also think LLM's are still in their infancy, and there is so much we have yet to discover about them. For example for my use-case as a programmer, I see a lot of potential in spec-driven development, where a task is broken down into tiny subtasks that can then each be implemented and tested, and not be too complex for a local LLM to achieve. But how to formulate those specs? How does the workflow look like? I don't know.\n\nAnd that's maybe another issue - so many of the AI integrators (like IDE chat plugins) expect to talk to a frontier model like Claude Sonnet, Gemini or GPT. But when I plug them into a smaller model, they shouldn't just use the exact same prompts, but more specialized ones, and I fear there's just not enough interest in the community in perfecting this.",

Frontier LLMs went insane on reasoning, open‑source finally became “good enough” for a ton of real workloads, OCR and VLMs leveled up, and audio models quietly made agents actually usable in the real world. ​ Here’s a category‑wise recap of the “best of 2025” models that actually changed how people build stuff, not just leaderboard screenshots:\n\n\n\nLLMs and reasoning\n\n\\* GPT‑5.2 (Thinking / Pro) – Frontier‑tier reasoning and coding, very fast inference, strong for long‑horizon tool‑using agents and complex workflows.\n\n​\\* Gemini 3 Pro / Deep Think – Multi‑million token context and multimodal “screen reasoning”; excels at planning, code, and web‑scale RAG / NotebookLM‑style use cases. \n\n\\* Claude 4.5 (Sonnet / Opus) – Extremely strong for agentic tool use, structured step‑by‑step plans, and “use the computer for me” style tasks. \n\n\\* DeepSeek‑V3.2 & Qwen3‑Thinking – Open‑weight monsters that narrowed the gap with closed models to within \\\\\\~0.3 points on key benchmarks while being orders of magnitude cheaper to run.\n\nIf 2023–24 was “just use GPT,” 2025 finally became “pick an LLM like you pick a database.”\n\nVision, VLMs & OCR\n\n\\* MiniCPM‑V 4.5 – One of the strongest open multimodal models for OCR, charts, documents, and even video frames, tuned to run on mobile/edge while still hitting SOTA‑ish scores on OCRBench/OmniDocBench. \n\n\\* olmOCR‑2‑7B‑1025 – Allen Institute’s OCR‑optimized VLM, fine‑tuned from Qwen2.5‑VL, designed specifically for documents and long‑form OCR pipelines. \n\n\\* InternVL 2.x / 2.5‑4B – Open VLM family that became a go‑to alternative to closed GPT‑4V‑style models for document understanding, scene text, and multimodal reasoning.\n\n\\* Gemma 3 VLM & Qwen 2.5/3 VL lines – Strong open(-ish) options for high‑res visual reasoning, multilingual OCR, and long‑form video understanding in production‑style systems. ​ \n\n2025 might be remembered as the year “PDF to clean Markdown with layout, tables, and charts” stopped feeling like magic and became a boring API call.\n\nAudio, speech & agents\n\n\\* Whisper (still king, but heavily optimized) – Remained the default baseline for multilingual ASR in 2025, with tons of optimized forks and on‑device deployments. \n\n\\* Low‑latency real‑time TTS/ASR stacks (e.g., new streaming TTS models & APIs) – Sub‑second latency + streaming text/audio turned LLMs into actual real‑time voice agents instead of “podcast narrators.” \n\n\\* Many 2025 voice stacks shipped as APIs rather than single models: ASR + LLM + real‑time TTS glued together for call centers, copilots, and vibecoding IDEs. ​ Voice went from “cool demo” to “I talk to my infra/IDE/CRM like a human, and it answers back, live.”\n\nOCR/document AI & IDP\n\n\\* olmOCR‑2‑7B‑1025, MiniCPM‑V 4.5, InternVL 2.x, OCRFlux‑3B, PaddleOCR‑VL – A whole stack of open models that can parse PDFs into structured Markdown with tables, formulas, charts, and long multi‑page layouts. \n\n\\* On top of these, IDP / “PDF AI” tools wrapped them into full products for invoices, contracts, and messy enterprise docs. ​ \n\nIf your 2022 stack was “Tesseract + regex,” 2025 was “drop a 100‑page scan and get usable JSON/Markdown back.” ​ \n\nOpen‑source LLMs that actually mattered\n\n\\* DeepSeek‑V3.x – Aggressive MoE + thinking budgets + brutally low cost; a lot of people quietly moved internal workloads here. \n\n\\* Qwen3 family – Strong open‑weight reasoning, multilingual support, and specialized “Thinking” variants that became default self‑host picks. \n\n\\* Llama 4 & friends – Closed the gap to within \\\\\\~0.3 points of frontier models on several leaderboards, making “fully open infra” a realistic choice for many orgs.\n\n​In 2025, open‑source didn’t fully catch the frontier, but for a lot of teams, it crossed the “good enough + cheap enough” threshold.\n\nYour turn This list is obviously biased toward models that:\n\n\\* Changed how people build products (agents, RAG, document workflows, voice UIs)\n\n\\* Have public benchmarks, APIs, or open weights that normal devs can actually touch ​- What did you ship or adopt in 2025 that deserves “model of the year” status?\n\nFavorite frontier LLM?\n\n\\* Favorite open‑source model you actually self‑hosted?\n\n\\* Best OCR / VLM / speech model that saved you from pain?\n\n\\* Drop your picks below so everyone can benchmark / vibe‑test them going into 2026.",

K2 Thinking works best high RAM rigs or with high GPU count, like twenty MI50 cards (for 640 GB VRAM in total) - I actually considered getting that much since at the time I looked into it, it was possible for half the price of RTX PRO 6000 and my motherboard could carry them all at PCI-E 4.0 x4 speed each, but I decided to stay with 4x3090 for now (because even though full VRAM inference would be faster, my current performance with 1 TB RAM + 96 GB VRAM is still acceptable to me, and a lot of what I do requires Nvidia cards, and not just LLMs either).",

Questions can't be more than a couple of sentences and it can't read more than 10 lines of code. Anything bigger than that and the results are just garbage.\n\nI really wish autocompletion was decent. I don't know what the LLM is being inspired by but some of the code it recommends is bonkers wrong. I am not trying to solve crazy computer science problems but create moderate level Python scripts. I really wish the LLM would read the entire project and then be inspired by it with the code it suggests. If the code I am working on does not use generators, then don't autocompletion suggest them to me.\n\nI will say one thing, qwen3-coder does a decent job in explain code to me. I just have to make sure to feed in a small amount of code for it to explain.",

          "text": "If you're coming from ChatGPT hoping to run something local, here's the dirty secret: the models are fine. Even a Q4 Gemma 3 handles 99% of normal conversations *if* it has tools.\n\nThe actual problem? The experience is still built for hobbyists who enjoy suffering.\n\nI see this constantly: someone installs a model, asks about current events, gets a stale answer, and rage-posts about how \"local models suck.\" Meanwhile they've never configured a single tool. The model isn't broken—their expectations are miscalibrated.\n\n**Here's the billion-dollar gap nobody's filled:**\n\n1. **A truly consumer-grade local app.** LM Studio got closest, but it's still prosumer at best. I'm talking \"my 70-year-old dad could set this up\" easy. One install, it just works.\n2. **Target normal hardware.** Most modern PCs have GPUs that can run Gemma 3 comfortably. Stop optimizing for the 4090 crowd.\n3. **One-click OAuth to cloud models for specific tasks.** Local inference for chat, API call to \\[insert frontier model\\] for image gen. Best of both worlds, zero friction.\n\nThe tech is ready. The models are ready. Someone just needs to wrap it in software that doesn't require a CS degree to configure.\n\nThat opportunity is still wide open.\n\n(Rewritten by Claude)\n\n\\---\n\n\\## Original Post\n\nIf you're talking about more consumer oriented \"I'd like to use local models instead of ChatGPT to get answers and chat\"....  THEN...  the user experience is the main place that running local models falls down. A few years ago when I started I had the same experience which is that a lot of people just getting started install a model, try a few queries and quickly realize that there is a lot of tuning, tool implementation, API keys and the like required to make it feel similar to the consumer chat apps we all use.\n\nEven smaller local models like the latest Q4 Gemma from Gogle are already fine for 99% of the chats a user would have as long as they have tools.\n\nWhat i see a lot in these forums is people installing a model, bitching about their answers being out-of-date and never realizing that their perception of \"not out of date\" has nothing to do with the model.\n\nSomebody could make a lot of money if you:\n\n1. Had a truly consumer like, delightful, no-tech-knowledge required multi-platform local app (kind of like LM Studio did, they make it so easy to try and use models, but still well beyond the average prosumer skill set). that just kind of \"sets it all up for me so I dont' have to think about it\"\n2. Focused on models that run on normal PCs, i mean most PCs these days have a GPU that would let you run Gemma 3 (i'm just a fan of perf/size profile)\n3. Oauth style 1-click integration into better models for tasks (meaning, if somebody wants to use google nano banana for images but they want local inference for everything else... which is a pretty good use case cause no good local image gen can compete with NB).\n\nUltimately, make running local small models easy enough to use that your average 70 year old could install it is a pretty cool opportunity. I've yet to find anything even remotely close to that.",

Right now these tools are geared towards people who want to invest time in learning the models and lingo. There really isn't a \"Just download this and it works\" option. \n\nThat's why I'm making Offloom. For that crowd. **But** I do think there's still some restrictions. Most casual users would expect chatGPT like responses in both speed and quality (or at least close to it). To do that it requires agentic behavior behind the scenes, strongly tested system prompts, rewriting queries, judging responses, and models that don't hallucinate terribly. \n\nThe only models I've found that can give infrequent hallucinations are thinking models. Then the problem becomes having a model that can run on something less than a 4090. Which means quantizing the models and choosing a sparse model that gives good time to first token rates.....\n\nI've been working on this for months. I've now got something that works, and works quite well. But even then I don't think people under 12GB vram would be able to run it to a degree that will be *acceptable to them*. And I've been cutting corners everywhere I can. But there comes a point where quality suffers too much.",

I'm trying to do something cool, and I'm hoping to learn what ideas I have that are valuable (what idea posts/comments get traction vs which don't) to people outside of myself and what ideas are best held as personal interests, as I plan out what it will take for me to build something potentially very cool.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I got **GPT-OSS-120B** running locally on my Mac Studio M2 Ultra (128GB), and I managed to get it fully integrated into a usable daily setup with Open WebUI and even VS Code (Cline).\n\nIt wasn’t straightforward—the sheer size of this thing kept OOMing my system even with 128GB RAM, but the performance is solid once it's dialed in. It essentially feels like having a private GPT-4.\n\nHere is the exact method for anyone else trying this.\n\n**The Hardware Wall**\n\n* **Machine:** Mac Studio M2 Ultra (128GB RAM)\n* **The Problem:** The FP16 KV cache + 60GB model weights = Instant crash if you try to utilize a decent context window.\n* **The Goal:** Run 120B parameters AND keep a 32k context window usable.\n\n**The Solution** Standard \n\n    mlx-lm\n\n1. **Model:** `gpt-oss-120b-MXFP4-Q8`  (This is the sweet spot—4-bit weights, 8-bit cache).\n2. **The Patch:** I modified `mlx_lm.server`  to accept new arguments: `--kv-bits 8`  and `--max-kv-size 32768` .\n   * *Why?* Without 8-bit cache quantization, the context window eats all RAM. With 8-bit, 32k context fits comfortably alongside the model.\n3. **Command:** `python -m mlx_lm.server --model ./gpt-oss-120b --kv-bits 8 --max-kv-size 32768 --cache-limit-gb 110`\n\n**The Stack:** Running the server is one thing; using it effectively is another.\n\n* **Open WebUI:**\n   * I built a custom Orchestrator (FastAPI) that sits between WebUI and MLX.\n   * **Dual Mode:** I created two model presets in WebUI:\n      1. **\"Oracle\"**: 120B raw speed. No tools, just fast answers.\n      2. **\"Oracle (Tools)\"**: Same model, but with RAG/Database access enabled.\n   * Keeps the UI fast for chat, but powerful when I need it to dig through my files.\n* **VS Code (Cline Integration):**\n   * This was the tricky part. Cline expects a very specific OpenAI chunk format.\n   * I had to write a custom endpoint in my orchestrator (`/api/cline/chat/completions` ) that strips out the internal \"thinking/analysis\" tokens (`<|channel|>analysis...` ) so Cline only sees the final clean code.\n   * Result: I have a massive local model driving my IDE with full project context, totally private.\n\n**The Experience** It’s honestly game-changing. The reasoning on 120B is noticeably deeper than the 70B models I was using (Llama 3/Qwen). It follows complex multi-file coding tasks in Cline without getting lost, and the 32k context is actually usable because of the memory patch.\n\nIf anyone wants the specific code patches for MLX or the docker config, let me know and I can share. Just wanted to share that it *is* possible to daily drive 120B on consumer Mac hardware if you maximize every GB.\n\n",

I use qdrant and postgresql for ground truth. I do stuff like this for versions of python that I have to use to stay compatible with other things I'm running. Or actually for langchain and langgraph too. They just changed compatibility versions so whenever I upgrade I can just use the newer repo in my rag with the updated information. I will still keep the old one until I am absolutely certain I won't revert but you can just leave it sit there and not reference the old one. Hope that makes sense.",

The performance of the model exceeds other models in the same parameter range of 20-32b and has very long context (up to a million tokens).\n\nNVIDIA worked with Unsloth for day 0 quants of the model. Unsloth makes efficient dynamic quants of models that retain very high levels of accuracy at lower precision.

I've written a script to run a benchmark test and measure speed with all combinations of different context length / % GPU-offload layer / force experts on CPU on vs off.\n\nWith smaller context (i.e. 10k tokens) I get up to 16 TPS. This drops to around 10 @200k tokens. I'm no expert but I don't think there will be a big difference between 5070 or 5080 if VRAM is the same.\n\nWhat i can't understand is that with nemotron it does not matter how much layers I offload to GPU. The model is around 30 GB but only between 4 and 6 GB VRAM is used regardless of offload setting. It seems only the active layers are offloaded to GPU. This was different when I qwen 2.5, where I had to balance the exact number of layers that would fit in VRAM. As soon as you try to offload more layers than fit in VRAM, regular RAM will be used as shared VRAM and TPS drop drastically. \n\nProbably nothing new here for most redditors on this sub but i'm new to local LLM's and had to figure out a lot of things myself.",

(you can very roughly calculate t/s by dividing memory bandwidth/model size, in this case 80GB/s / 80B@Q8 = 1)\n\nTypical VRAM bandwidth varies widely, from about 200 GB/s to 2000 GB/s on high-end gaming GPUs. If you somehow had 128 GB of VRAM, you could run an 80B Q8 model at roughly 2.5 tokens/s on the low GPU end and up to 25 tokens/s on the high end GPU.\n\nThere are also MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) models. While they may be 100B-parameter models overall, they do not use the entire model for every token, only a subset, for example \\~5B parameters. Because of this, even with a 100B MoE model running from system RAM, you could still achieve something like 20 tokens/s.",

      "text": "Google just released **A2UI (Agent-to-User Interface)** — an open-source standard that lets AI agents generate **safe, rich, updateable UIs** instead of just text blobs.\n\n👉 Repo: [https://github.com/google/A2UI/](https://github.com/google/A2UI/)\n\n# What is A2UI?\n\nA2UI lets agents “**speak UI**” using a **declarative JSON format**.  \nInstead of returning raw HTML or executable code (⚠️ risky), agents describe *intent*, and the client renders it using **trusted native components** (React, Flutter, Web Components, etc.).\n\nThink:  \nLLM-generated UIs that are **as safe as data, but as expressive as code**.\n\n# Why this matters\n\nAgents today are great at text and code, but terrible at:\n\n* Interactive forms\n* Dashboards\n* Step-by-step workflows\n* Cross-platform UI rendering\n\nA2UI fixes this by cleanly separating:\n\n* **UI generation (agent)**\n* **UI execution (client renderer)**\n\n# Core ideas\n\n* 🔐 **Security-first**: No arbitrary code execution — only pre-approved UI components\n* 🔁 **Incremental updates**: Flat component lists make it easy for LLMs to update UI progressively\n* 🌍 **Framework-agnostic**: Same JSON → Web, Flutter, React (coming), SwiftUI (planned)\n* 🧩 **Extensible**: Custom components via a registry + smart wrappers (even sandboxed iframes)\n\n# Real use cases\n\n* Dynamic forms generated during a conversation\n* Remote sub-agents returning UIs to a main chat\n* Enterprise approval dashboards built on the fly\n* Agent-driven workflows instead of static frontends\n\n# Current status\n\n* 🧪 **v0.8 – Early Public Preview**\n* Spec & implementations are evolving\n* Web + Flutter supported today\n* React, SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose planned\n\n# Try it\n\nThere’s a **Restaurant Finder demo** showing end-to-end agent → UI rendering, plus Lit and Flutter renderers.\n\n👉 [https://github.com/google/A2UI/](https://github.com/google/A2UI/)\n\nThis feels like a big step toward **agent-native UX**, not just chat bubbles everywhere. Curious what the community thinks — is this the missing layer for real agent apps?",

Then when no one has the infrastructure to do it but them and they have killed the pool of tech workers, then they'll raise prices and companies wont have options to pivot.

I mostly use ChatGPT-5.2 pro, some opus 4.5, and surprisingly little Gemini although I have the $250/month tier with them (currently on an extended trial). \n\nI use local LLMs primarily as **objects** of my research, rather than as an LLM customer. I rarely use them for code generation or as an assistant. I can run models up to 30b without any issues. They are performant for my needs. \n\nI am currently waiting to see if Apple drops an M5 max or ultra. If they do, I will buy it a Mac Studio at launch with enough ram that I will wince when I buy it. Whatever their 2026/7 hw turns out to be, I’m buying a desktop version of it. \n\nI’m not really a hw person at this point in my life/career. I don’t want to spend time figuring out questions about getting my tools optimized to wring the most out of every last cpu cycle or byte of ram. I really do want it to “just work,” as the Apple folks used to say. \n\nI wish I had gotten more ram when I bought my mbp at launch - I am running into constraints daily. The problem is that I’m using my laptop as my pc (coding, writing, reading, web, etc) while using those same resources to run local LLMs. My work also involves me running extended mathematical functions on embeddings, so the performance of the m4 max comes into play there. \n\nI use both ollama and lm studio - lm studio has some performance advantages on the Mac. Both support my other apps/needs with apis and services, so I go back and forth. I also run associated services like litellm, depending on my needs. \n\nI highly recommend it as a platform, and you’d be better off than I am if you max out on the ram. Right now it’s the only thing I’d change. I believe the current Apple silicon performance tiers are M3 ultra > m4 max > M5 base > m4 others. \n\nHappy to answer any other questions.",

This keeps it fast and accurate without needing 64GB of RAM.\n* **Joint 3 (Verification)**: This is the cool part. It has a specific \"Fact-Check\" stage that reads the retrieved text and effectively says, \"Wait, does this text actually support what the user is claiming?\" If not, it corrects you.\n\n**Who is this for?**\n\n* Data hoarders (like me) with terabytes of ZIMs.\n* Researchers working in air-gapped environments.\n* Privacy advocates who want zero data leakage.\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n\n* Pure Python + `llama-cpp-python` (GGUF models)\n* Native ZIM file support (no conversion needed)\n* FAISS for the JIT indexing\n\nI've also included a tool called **\"Forge\"** so you can turn your own PDF/Markdown folders into ZIM files and treat them like Wikipedia.\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/0nspaceshipearth/Hermit-AI](https://github.com/0nspaceshipearth/Hermit-AI)",

It’s an “OpenAPI-compatible” endpoint, so you can use it remotely with any number of frontends that support it.\n\nBy far the most common/popular choice _(and what I use personally)_ is [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) which has a ChatGPT-esque look to it. It’s a lightweight webserver that you can run easily as a docker container.\n\nOnce set up, you can configure Open WebUI to connect to any remote API, such as Anthropic or ChatGPT. In this case you’d point it at your locally hosted LM Studio API.\n\nSince it’s web based, you can use it directly on your phone via web browser, so long as you’re on the same network as your PC.\n\n_Additionally, you could try out [Conduit](https://github.com/cogwheel0/conduit), which is a native mobile app for accessing Open WebUI, and is available on the App Store/Play Store. You’d still need to set up Open WebUI, but IMO the Conduit interface is a bit nicer on my phone than trying to use Open WebUI in a mobile browser. This is very optional though, you can just use it in a browser._",

I don't pay for these services, so I only use the lesser-capable models.\n\nMy laptop is not powerful enough to run this (no GPU / I've experimented with ollama but I can only run the smallest models very slowly so this is not ok for daily use), so I'm currently considering building a device dedicated to running a LLM, mainly for coding purposes. Ideally something small, Raspberry Pi-based or similar would be great.\n\nI have a few questions: is there specialized hardware for this (I've heard of TPU/NPU)? What kind of performance can I expect (I'd need at least GPT4/Devstral level)? I'm also worried about speed (tokens/s) and cost.\n\n  \nAny advice is appreciated!\n\nCheers!",

It would seem that AMD GPUs are priced better than NVIDIA GPUs (and I was even considering some Chinese GPUs). \n\nAs I am reading around, it sounds like NVIDIA has the advantage of CUDA, but I'm not quite sure what this really is and why it is an advantage. For example, can't AMD simply make their chips compatible with CUDA? Or can't they make it so that their chips are also efficient running PyTorch?\n\n\n\nAgain, I'm pretty much a novice in this space, so some of the words I am using I don't even really know what they are and how they relate to others. Is there an ELI5 on this? Like...the RTX 3090 is a GPU (hardware chip). Is CUDA like the firmware that allows the OS to use the GPU to do calculations? And is it that most LLM tools written with CUDA API calls in mind but not AMD's equivalent firmware API calls? Is that what makes it such that AMD is less efficient or poorly supported with LLM applications?\n\n\n\nSorry if the question doesn't make much sense... ",

Consider using a realistic tool like ClickHouse so that your MVP scales and \"proves\" it can handle 15M, 1.8TB documents in production.\n\nSecond, are you self-hosting your solution on-premise or thinking of managed cloud service? Between the two, the managed service would come cheaper overall due to competitive pricing on cloud and additional maintenance cost (and pain) for self-hosting. But to get a good estimate, you MUST decide on your RAG method.\n\nThird, how much of fine tuning have you done in your MVP? I assume foundation models wouldn't be sufficient for LEGAL context.  I'd expect that to be part of your estimate equation since it's NOT a one-shot tuning and bang, it lasts forever kinda solution, is it.\n\nPresenting your case with your current MVP makes you look like you don't know what you are doing.

          "text": "A big part of your problem with the model retaining stuff is likely because Ollama's default context size is very small (context is like a model's memory).  I hear it's also a problem for smaller models to handle large context even when it is enabled though.  You can make Ollama's context size bigger, but for some reason it slows down inference speed a LOT on Ollama whether you using/needing the larger context or not.\n\nI would stongly suggest using llama.cpp instead.  I switched to it and get better performance even with small prompts but also llama.cpp has the models full available context size enabled by default.\n\nIf you can, try out Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B or GLM-4.5-Air, even if it's crazy slow, just to see what kind of answers it gives.  If it's helpful, then might be worth investing in hardware that can run those at conversation-speeds, or even hardware that can run an even bigger and better model (GLM-4.7 is by far my favorite but not really runnable on my hardware).\n\n---\n\nMy thoughts on cloud AI providers: they are losing insane amounts of money right now, which means they will eventually have to charge insane rates to be profitable.

That'd be for things that don't define my business but are just general agentic actions, code, or best practices. Then for brainstorming or coding business specific things I'm using local models:\nGLM4.7 is the closest open weight claude alternative (professional thoughtful solutions) \nMinimaxM2.1 is the open weight gemini option for me (I fit longer context since it's smaller than glm4.7) \nGlm4.6v or qwen3vl30b give me picture analysis abilities.\nGpt-oss-120b/ 20b depending on my hardware and the amount of logic needed in a task are my fast agentic tool callers.\n\nHonorable mention: Qwen3coder480b supposedly isn't high on ai intelligence benchmarks but it just writes code really well the way I like. I dont have it do anything else but that's also why I find myself using glm4.7 and Minimaxm2.1 more since they can do more than code \n\n\nCompanies have data agreements based on account types so understand those terms and decide if you trust the company to stick to it since nowadays contracts only seem to matter to limit the smaller entity while whichever is bigger gets to violate terms",

                  "text": "That's a good question as I wasn't aiming for a 100% realistic example, just something to illustrate my point that the top-tier cloud AI subscriptions are horrifically ravenous for your money over time and it simply makes the best business sense to me to invest in owned assets rather than renting. AI isn't going away any time soon and the capabilities that, say, just 64 GB bare-metal VRAM provides to an individual or small business is nothing to laugh at.\n\nCloud AI seems to be justifying the cost by doing what all typical managed hosting providers do: \n\n- they install the bare metal equipment and maintain it.\n- give you some fancy proprietary interface to the AI models running on the equipment.\n- etc.\n\nThe AI models they offer may also be proprietary, and this is the worst part for me since you're endlessly at the mercy of the provider changing/\"upgrading\" the model and throwing everything you've built on top of the old model into disorder and disarray. And they then soon retire the old model for good... Good luck with that. It's like if programming languages and frameworks simply deleted and completely disabled the old versions of their software after every version update, meaning you can't even run a legacy app anymore. Imagine...\n\nAnyway, as for \"how many GPUs on a single mobo\", check this out for example:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1c9l181/10x3090_rig_romed82tepyc_7502p_finally_complete/\n\nThat person's running all that (**240 GB VRAM!**) on one mobo that costs $610. The whole setup with accessories, etc, costs a good chunk, but again the most expensive parts are the GPUs, which is why I originally suggested stacking however many 5060 Ti 16 GB's as they seem the best bang for the buck considering price, VRAM amount, and CUDA and FP4 support.\n\nI'd caution to do your homework if anyone's actually considering more than 2-4 5060 Ti's though, for other intricate reasons such as limited bandwidth compared to the higher-end cards, and whether they actually play nicely together after 2 or more, etc. It was just a top of my head example because I have a mere 1x 5060 Ti 16 GB and I'm getting by just fine with it and local models for my purposes (including professional stuff for work). I'm a one-man show, though, and this is not quite suitable for multi-member small business needs.\n\nThere's this mindset that pops up often, that AI isn't worth doing unless you're running the most Megatastic machine available and that's not true in my experience. Yes you must put in some technical and often uncertain legwork, or hire someone to help if it's for business, but the smaller open models are really capable and I believe there's diminishing returns for most people who aren't running protein-folding simulations, the more compute you throw at things. At a certain point, what you get out of a model becomes less about how \"big\" it is and more about how you're able to squeeze out the most from what you've got, and that requires a bit of creativity like proper prompting systems, context curation, whatever, over and above any purely technical concerns.",

If possible, I would invest in hardware or self-host small LLMs on the cloud, these are more than enough for most tasks with a bit of fine-tuning and a RAG index. From there, you can keep improving and scaling over time.",

If you want something a little easier to start with try Forge or Automatic1111 - they're more like permanent workflows where you just fill in the boxes you want to use and hit go. When you understand how all the parts work together then you can come over to Comfy and start putting the pieces of the workflow together like building blocks. Main thing you gotta know is there are a few base models that have a bunch of derivatives and you can only combine parts made for the same base model, Stable Diffusion XL checkpoints, Loras, controlnets, etc will only work with other SDXL components. And Flux ones will only work with Flux. So don't try to mix them. But if there's one thing that really drives this community forward, it's the endless drive of millions of users for on-demand custom porn, so you are far more likely to have more options than you know what to do with.\n\nWhen you're feeling really adventurous, some of the chat front ends can give your text models the ability to send prompts to your image models to make their own pictures. If you have the vram space to run a chat bot with a vision model and an image generating model together, you can send dirty selfies to your virtual Waifu that it can actually \"see\" and then it can send some back.",

          "text": "It's a bit of a complex question to answer. Here's my take from the standpoint of someone who builds custom AI solutions:\n\n1. Yes, you can run a 13B model on your GPU, with a few caveats;\n A. You will need a deeply quantized model, due to low dedicated VRAM(your shared RAM is for the iGPU, and won't really help you here.) \n B. Be prepared for hallucinations a lot of times. (Deeply quantized models lose a lot of mathematical precision, causing them to often pick bad tokens to return, and this will cascade, no ECC VRAM, which means a single bit-flip will cascade through the rest of the returned tokens and then you just get word salad.)\n2. For your RAG, an \"in-memory\"  K-V database would be best for your assistant's \"memory\". If you can get QDrant running locally, it's the best way to go. And drop the huge allocation to your iGPU, it's not doing you any favors.\n3. You'll need something to front this and tie it together, like Open-WebUI. There's going to be a good deal of setup.\n\nIf you want something good and local, it's going to cost. Your setup would work, but I don't think it would really perform as well as you'd like.\n\nUsing a Cloud AI such as ChatGPT/Llama/etc seems cheap because most big AI vendors are still taking massive losses due to investment capital. Local AI seems expensive in comparison because AI in fact ISN'T cheap, but \"the big kids\" have money behind them, which allows them to mask the true costs.",

          "text": "> Answer extremely specific questions like, “What was the eye colour of [character I mentioned offhandedly two months ago]?”\n\nI'm going to set your expectations, brutally.\n\nThis is a wild moonshot with what you have, and, frankly, what's available right now.\n\nRAG is nice, but it's not the silver bullet that a lot of LLM-pushing folks were pretending it was (it was the 'answer to everything' about six months ago).\n\nAll RAG is:\n\n* You put in your prompt\n* Your prompt is turned into maths\n* Your prompt's maths is compared to a list of documents, and the maths that most closely matches your prompt is then snipped out and handed over to the model\n* Your system prompt + your prompt + your RAG results -> get fed into the model to get your answer.\n\nSo, if you say 'what's the colour of Wyvern's eyes?' - it's going to look for whatever sentences, paragraphs, etc in your draft are CLOSEST to 'colour', 'eyes', 'Wyvern', 'what's the'.\n\nIn other words, 'What's the colour of Wyvern's scales?' is pretty close, so the RAG result may pull that. You may also get 'What's the colour of Sweet-thing's eyes?' because, yeah. Close.\n\nOh, you mentioned 'eyes' a lot in your book? Guess you're *shit out of luck*.\n\nThis isn't to say 'don't do this', this is me - who has worked on a LOT of stuff for custom fiction writing - saying 'set your expectations low... lower... lower than that'.\n\n> 8GB dedicated VRAM\n\nI know 13B's were mentioned. Honestly, if you want something decent for decent speed, a 7b is prob. the best you're going to get nicely here.\n\n7b is '7 billion parameters', it's a metric of how big (complex) the model is. It's not how *good* it is, that's going to depend on topics, data it got fed, etc, but rather, how big its capacity for storing more and MOAR stuff in it is.\n\nSo, time for some good news? Yes? Ok then!\n\n* Get KoboldCPP - this is the simplest (IMHO) way to get a model running. One fucking .exe file, and off you go\n* Get yourself a model - your mileage may vary, models are like toothpaste. No one cares, which one you use, they'll have evangelists just use one. I personally use my own bullshit ones, and, Sultry Silicon v2 (I like v2 over v3). Yes, it's a lewd one.\n* Get SillyTavern\n\n* SillyTavern's ui -> lorebooks. You can dump shit in here, it's not the best, but basically it says 'you mentioned THIS keyword, I'll just ADD THIS TEXT', so if you have a planet called Grassfucker, and a lorebook entry for Grassfucker, any time your prompt says that word, ST adds the lorebook entry to your prompt.\n\nBUT, this obviously eats your context, so it means your model 'remembers' less conversation as you go. \n\nAfter you get these two things set up, dork around with them for a while, you'll start going 'well, this is nice, BUT...' and start making either your own clients, or your own datasets + models. Slippery slopes, and all that.\n\nFeel free to ask a few more questions, but ultimately: you gotta pick shit up and play with it.",

But it's the only UI that I've been able to use that consistently gives longer replies in when doing AI chat.  \n\nExample - Dark Desires 12B.  In LM Studio, I get usually around 3 paragraphs.  Kobold, Oobabooga - it's like 1 sentence.  It gets a little better if I have Sillytavern connected to Kobold, but not much.\n\n  \nAny ideas why?  I want to migrate beyond LM, but the response length being longer is what is keeping me there.\n\n  \nContext length = 4096.  Temp = 0.8.  Top K = 40.  Repeat = 1.1.  Min P = 0.05.  Top P = 0.95.

Its functionality and UX makes the others look archaic and it works with Blackwell GPUs out of the box. I love that I can switch models on the fly when using it with SillyTavern, experimenting with different models to see how they handle the same RP scenarios.\n\nEven though Studio was the best option for running various models on my 5090, I ended up going back to OpenRouter for SillyTavern. The flagship models are just impossible to beat with local hardware if you're into complex RPG-style scenarios and long narrative arcs.\n\nGood luck!",

You could just grab entry-level versions of newer chips for raw processing power and potentially cluster them together.\n\nBasically: Lock in the RAM now, upgrade compute later on the cheap.\n\nAm I thinking about this right, or am I missing something obvious about how clustering/distributed inference would actually work with Apple Silicon?",

Unless someone with a Digitimes subscription would like to share the article with the sources...\n\nPricing for soon-to-be-released M5 Pro, Max, and Ultra will be a key indicator of how good Apple's DRAM supply contracts are, and what actually expired. The majority of the DRAM they buy is ordinary LPDDR for iPhones.\n\nIt will be interesting times, for sure. RAM is only a fraction of the BOM cost, especially for MacBook Pro and Mac Studio. They could choose to eat the difference until prices come down. Their size gives them a lot of leverage, so they will be the last to suffer, and the least.",

For inference they're probably the cheapest but in a sea of insanity it's always tough to say anyone's benefiting with any price on tech lol. \n\nI also think NVME drives are set to go up soon. They're also going to be impacted with the DRAM shortages since NAND Flash has parallel supply constraints.\n\nAll of it compounds. I train models so secured my rig all the way back last march since I saw this insanity coming but if I was looking at a pure inference machine and I needed it sooner and couldn't wait a year or 2 then I'd probably pick up an Apple machine.",

          "text": "Unfortunately I think the answer is “we don’t know yet”. The Exo / RDMA stuff is exciting, but it’s still not entirely clear how it will play out and what the real-world capabilities are. The Exo folks did post a teaser showing a DGX ‘clustered’ to a Mac Studio over TB implying that prompt processing on the Nvidia and inference on the Mac was better than just running the Mac, but it was short on details. At some point even TB5 bandwidth is going to be a limitation, and it’s entirely possible that the NPU improvements in the M5 series will be good enough to make the added complexity of clustering unattractive.\n\nThere also was a post a couple months back about someone getting an AMD gpu working (for compute, not graphics output) in a TB PCIE dock on an Apple Silicon Mac, but this was just a POC and I don’t believe it was to the point of actually being able to run LLM models on it. Personally I think this is more intriguing as it seems more likely to gain adoption in the ‘budget crowd’  - dropping a 7900XTX into a dock is less daunting than managing multiple machines. But once again - whether this is actually something that willl work ‘in production’ remains to be seen.\n\nI’m struggling with the same questions. I have a 64GB M1 Max, and really want to move to at least 128GB. But an M5 Max128GB  might be $5k+ with the ram shortage. An M4 Max is too limited in PP compared to what ‘should be’ coming to make me comfortable sinking the $$ into it at the moment, although if the external GPU idea materializes that would probably change. I’m seriously eyeing a Framework Strix Halo motherboard with the idea that the X4 slot might allow hybrid GPU/Unified functionallity, but I haven’t actuallly seen any results suggesting you can divide PP/TG to really get the best of both worlds. (i.e. basically the same idea as an external GPU on a Mac, but with lower TG performance)",
