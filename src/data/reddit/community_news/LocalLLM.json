              "text": "Really appreciate the detailed breakdown.\n\n1. Makes total sense, VRAM is the hard ceiling and everything else is optimization after that. The documentation gap for multi-GPU is real, I've spent more time piecing together config from GitHub issues than actual docs.\n\n2. Good to hear. I'm mixing card types but pinning models deliberately so each card basically runs independently.\n\n3. That's a fast ROI, are you running inference as a service or using it for internal workloads?\n\n4. This is the point I keep coming back to. The trend toward stronger smaller models is exactly why I went with a distributed multi-card approach rather than dumping everything into one or two massive GPUs. If a 70B model can do what a 400B does today, having flexible GPU allocation matters more than raw single-card VRAM.\n\n5. Haha noted. I did a lot of benchmarking and testing before committing to the full build, but I can see how easy it would be to overbuy on hardware that doesn't match your actual workload.  I also spent around $5-6k using open AI API (Using Chat GPT 4o) via Azure in December.\n\n",

          "text": "Your build is awesome, I am doing something very similar.  Here are some improvements you may want to consider:\n\n1. Upgrade your processor to improve your memory bandwidth.  You have a Threadripper Pro CPU and Motherboard which is better than the non pro Threadripper systems for two reasons: a) more PCIe lanes and b) 8 memory channels.  Unfortunately the 9955wx CPU only has two CCDs so can't utilize all 8 memory channels - you need a CPU with more CCDs (such as the 9965wx) to make use of the 8 memory channels.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mcrx23/psa\\_the\\_new\\_threadripper\\_pros\\_9000\\_wx\\_are\\_still/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mcrx23/psa_the_new_threadripper_pros_9000_wx_are_still/)\n2. PCIe 5.0 has benefits for AI.  The 3090tis are good bang/buck but they are running over PCIe 4.0 so can't take advantage of the new PCIe 5.0 features.  The actual benefit of an all PCIe 5.0 solution depends on your use case and model but it is more than just twice the bandwidth. [https://www.graniteriverlabs.com/en-us/technical-blog/pcie-gen-5-ai-ml](https://www.graniteriverlabs.com/en-us/technical-blog/pcie-gen-5-ai-ml)\n3. The up coming Apple M5 systems may very well be the best bang/buck due to their recently released RDMA over TB5, MLX AI acceleration and its high speed unified memory architecture.  I am really looking forward to seeing how a cluster of M5 mac minis does.  Check out exo: [https://github.com/exo-explore/exo](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo)",

I only run Debian 12, one instance of ollama and only one model at a time.\n\nI spent a fair amount of time on PCIe and power tuning.  A lot of performance problems that I had was because when running a larger model that spanned multiple cards, the latency caused by traversing the PCIe bus (and sometimes Numa node) was just long enough that the cards power management would bump it from P2 to P5+, then jump back up to P2 when it actually needed to do something, which added even more latency, which caused cascading slowdown across all the cards where I'd start off really fast, then as the response typed out, it would progressively slow down to the point of just a couple tokens a second.  My setup is not PCIe x16 for every card, so that also exacerbated the issue.\n\nThe solution was multi-fold: \n1. set the power management so that the cards idle at P3 and jump to P2 for inference.  This fixed a huge amount of performance problems with larger contexts and responses.  \n2. Put the cards that actually have PCIe x16 connections on the ends of the chain and the x8 cards in the middle.  Also, order the cards (in ollama.service) so that all the cards on each numa node are together to minimize the number of cross numa jumps during inference.  \n3. Also in the bios, set the PCI max request packet size to 4096.  On my particular system, it defaulted to 128.  Turns out the 3060s won't do more than 256, but it's worth more than a couple tokens a second.\n4. Also in the BIOS, turn rebar on so the system can see and address the entire PCIe VRAM instead of addressing it in 256MB chunks, also worth a few more tokens per second.",

Then there will be an influx of 1-click setup tools and guides.\n\nHonestly, I've been loving all the exploration and learning with the past couple of trends, but I'll admit, it's a bit much to keep up with.

I advise you to ask an AI to give you the details of the calculations and depreciation costs; it's quite easy to compare different scenarios.\n\nThe difference with GPUs for gaming, where latency is critical, does not apply to the usual use of AI, so again, this does not argue in favor of local processing.\n\nOn the other hand, for those who want to work with AI, having the hardware to perform all the tests is very valuable.

For coding, that usually shows up as wrong APIs, subtle logic bugs, or broken refactors, invalid json generation. In practice, 4-bit is often considered the lowest “comfortable” range for usable quants.\n\nThat said, it really depends on the quantization method and how well it’s done. A very good 3-bit quant of GLM-5 could actually be interesting to try. But I’d be very skeptical that a typical 1-bit GLM-5 would outperform an 8-bit Qwen coder for real coding work.",

      "text": "I didn't want to buy two systems. That was the whole thing.\n\nI needed a NAS. I also wanted to mess around with local LLMs. And I really didn't want to explain to my wife why I needed a second box just to talk to a chatbot that sometimes hallucinates, I have my father-in-law for that. So when I was specing out my NAS build, I went a little heavier than most people would and crossed my fingers that the system could pull double duty down the road.\n\nHonestly? I was prepared to be wrong. Worst case I'd have an overpowered NAS that never breaks a sweat. I could live with that.\n\nBut it actually worked. And way better than I expected.\n\n**The Build**\n\n* Minisforum N5 Pro\n* AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 370 (12c/24t, 16 RDNA 3.5 CUs)\n* 96GB DDR5-5600 (2x 48GB SO-DIMMs)\n* 5x 26TB Seagate Exos in RAIDZ2 (\\~70TB usable)\n* 2x 1.92TB Samsung PM983 NVMe (ZFS metadata mirror)\n* TrueNAS SCALE\n\nDay to day it runs Jellyfin with VAAPI hardware transcoding, Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, qBittorrent, FlareSolverr, Tailscale, and Dockge. It was already earning its keep before I ever touched LLM inference.\n\n**The Experiment**\n\nThe model is Qwen3-Coder-Next, 80 billion parameters, Mixture of Experts architecture with 3B active per token. I'm running the Q4\\_K\\_M quantization through llama.cpp with the Vulkan backend. Here's how it actually went:\n\n**3 tok/s** \\- First successful run. Vanilla llama.cpp and Qwen3-Coder-Next Q8 quantization, CPU-only inference. Technically working. Almost physically painful to watch. But it proved the model could run.\n\n**5 tok/s** \\- Moved to Q4\\_K\\_M quantization and started tuning. Okay. Nearly double the speed and still slow as hell...but maybe usable for an overnight code review job. Started to think maybe this hardware just won't cut it.\n\n**10 tok/s** \\- Ran across a note in a subreddit that someone got Vulkan offloading and doing 11 tok/s on similar hardware but when I tried it...I couldn't load the full model into VRAM despite having plenty of RAM. Interesting. I tried partial offload, 30 out of 49 layers to the iGPU. It worked. Now it actually felt usable but it didn't make sense that I had all this RAM and it wouldn't load all of the expert layers.\n\n**15 tok/s** \\- Then the dumb breakthrough. I discovered that `--no-mmap` was quietly destroying everything. On UMA architecture, where the CPU and GPU share the same physical RAM, that flag forces the model to be allocated twice into the same space. Once for the CPU, once for GPU-mapped memory, both pulling from the same DDR5 pool. I couldn't even load all 49 layers without OOM errors with that flag set. Dropped it. All 49 layers loaded cleanly. 46GB Vulkan buffer. No discrete GPU.\n\n**18 tok/s** \\- Still I wanted more. I enabled flash attention. An extra 3 tok/s, cut KV cache memory in half, and significantly boosted the context window.\n\n3 → 5 → 10 → 15 → 18. Each step was one discovery away from quitting. Glad I didn't.\n\n**Results (Flash Attention Enabled)**\n\n* Up to 18 tok/s text generation\n* 53.8 tok/s prompt processing\n* 50% less KV cache memory\n* Fully coherent output at any context length\n* All while Jellyfin was streaming to the living room for the kids\n\nCouldn't I just have bought a box purpose built for this? Yep. For reference, a Mac Mini M4 Pro with 64GB runs $2,299 and gets roughly 20-25 tok/s on the same model. Apple's soldered LPDDR5x gives it a real bandwidth advantage. But then it wouldn't run my media stack, store 70TB of data in RAIDZ2. I'm not trying to dunk on the Mac at all. Just saying I didn't have to buy one AND a NAS.\n\nWhich was the whole point.\n\nNo exotic kernel flags. No custom drivers. No ritual sacrifices. Vulkan just works on RDNA 3.5 under TrueNAS.\n\n**Still On the Table**\n\nI've barely scratched the surface on optimization, which is either exciting or dangerous depending on your relationship with optimizing. Speculative decoding could 2-3x effective speed. EXPO memory profiles might not even be enabled, meaning I could be leaving free bandwidth sitting at JEDEC defaults. Thread tuning, KV cache quantization, newer Vulkan backends with RDNA 3.5 optimizations landing regularly, UMA buffer experimentation, different quant formats.\n\nOn top of all that, the model wasn't even designed to run on standard transformer attention. It was built for DeltaNet, a linear attention mechanism that scales way better at long context. There's an active PR implementing it and we've been helping test and debug it. The fused kernel already hits 16 tok/s on a single CPU thread with perfect output, but there's a threading bug that breaks it at multiple cores. When that gets fixed and it can use all 12 cores plus Vulkan offloading, the headroom is significant. Especially for longer conversations where standard attention starts to choke.\n\n18 tok/s is where I am but I'm hopeful it's not where this tops out.\n\n**The Takeaway**\n\nI'm not saying everyone should overbuild their NAS for an LLM machine or that this was even a good idea. But if you're like me, enjoy tinkering and learning, and are already shopping for a NAS and you're curious about local LLMs, it might be worth considering specing a little higher if you can afford it and giving yourself the option. I didn't know if this would work when I bought the hardware, a lot of people said it wasn't worth the effort. I just didn't want to buy two systems if I didn't have to.\n\nTurns out I didn't have to. If you enjoyed the journey with me, leave a comment. If you think I'm an idiot, leave a comment. If you've already figured out what I'm doing wrong to get more tokens, definitely leave a comment.",

I have different hardware but maybe this will get a few extra tokens per second:\n\n\n--threads 16 --batch-size 512\n\n\nThat gave me 2 tokens per second extra. Small, but it means a lot when it's sub 20 tokens.  Of course, fix threads to 1 or 2 less cores than you have available for llama server. In my case flash attention didn't help so I left it off.\n\nAlso, I wonder if the 2 bit XL quant is accurate enough, it will probably give you 10 tokens per second extra over the 4. Play with your context size too, I find 64k is good middle ground.",

I haven't even looked into if anyone's actually benchmarked spec decode on MoE models and has real numbers.\n\nBut...it is 80B total parameters with 3B active per token. The routing layer is still selecting from the full 80B every forward pass. It's not the same workload as a dense 3B model. The memory bandwidth requirements alone make that obvious since a dense 3B doesn't need 46GB of VRAM. Each step has been about trying it and debugging and seeing what we end up with. 🤷‍♂️",

          "text": "People don't always realize clustering is good for parallel tasks, not single-stream inference. Splitting one model across multiple nodes means every layer boundary ships activations over the network. On 10GbE that's about 1.25 GB/s. Your nodes spend more time waiting on each other than doing math. You end up slower than a single fat node. \n\nThat said someone in this thread mentioned InfiniBand between two Strix Halo boxes and that actually offloads this bottleneck significantly. Used ConnectX-4/5 EDR cards run about $150-200 each and give you 100 Gbps, roughly 11 GB/s actual throughput with RDMA. That's 9x faster than 10GbE and makes tensor parallelism viable. 256GB unified memory across two nodes, 470B models at Q4, about $4,500 total. Interesting build. \n\nBut for a single $5K box? Mac Studio M4 Max. 128GB. $3,499.\n\n400 GB/s memory bandwidth, 128GB unified so no VRAM ceiling, silent, low power. Q3CN (80B MoE) would do roughly 40-60 tok/s. Most open models through 2026 will fit in 128GB quantized.\n\nThe RTX 5090 has insane bandwidth (about 1,800 GB/s) but only 32GB VRAM. Anything that fits in 32GB will scream. Anything that doesn't, and that's most of the interesting models, won't run at all without spilling to system RAM and tanking performance.\n\nThe M3 Ultra is last gen. Wait for the M4 Ultra if you want 256GB+ unified but that'll blow past $5K.\n\nFor context I'm running Q3CN on a Minisforum N5 Pro (Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 370, 96GB DDR5, 16 RDNA 3.5 CUs) and hitting 18 tok/s on the iGPU via Vulkan at about 95 GB/s bandwidth. No discrete GPU. Token gen is bandwidth-bound so it scales roughly linear. A Strix Halo box at 212 GB/s would be around 40 tok/s. The M4 Max at 400 GB/s would push 75+.\n\nSave the $1,500 left over for when the M4 Ultra drops. Sell the Max and upgrade to 256GB at 800 GB/s. That's the real next step for local inference in a tight little box.",

I’ve seen wild 3090 builds, these things are zip tied to racks and feeding into servers to utilize the enterprise ram and power supplies.\n\n5090 in a gaming PC is way more practical.

It sounds not better than Suno, not even better than older versions, like, 2 years ago versions? Realisticly? Like Suno 2. (I thing actual version of Suno is 4 or 4.5, or something like that and every new version sonds better than previous, so much better one would not want to return to previous version)\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still love that we have Suno at home, though, that's a lot, it don't have to beat Suno to be great.",

It's decent!\n\nThe tasks I tested were pretty simple, just some small refactoring in my toy project and fixing one bug. But that's exactly the point, for these kind of everyday coding tasks, you ain't gonna need Opus 4.6 level of intelligence, a \"small and sweet\" open source model is usually good enough.\n\nI feel like 80b model is a sweet spot for GX10 with 128GB of GPU memory, 8-bit quantized models could be comfortably loaded into the GPU. For comparison between the two devices, you can clearly see M3 ultra gives a higher throughput, but it's 3x the price of GX10.\n\nDo you think going local will be the coming trend?",

If you don’t want to spend that much, a Bossgame at €1500–1700 will also do the job, just with lower performance. But if you’re looking to run parallel requests (agents or multiple users), the GB10 will be far more capable. Same thing if you want to run larger models: you can link two GB10s together to get 256 GB of memory, which can let you run MiniMax M2.1 at roughly Q4 equivalent without issues using vLLM.\n\nI don’t have a Mac, but in my opinion it’s not worth it, except for an M3 Ultra with 256 GB / 512 GB of RAM.",

It’s also roughly 15% faster on token generation/writing (tg).\n\nTo make it concrete: if you’re coding with it using opencode, opencode injects a 10,000-token preprompt up front (tooling, capabilities, etc.). Add ~5,000 input tokens for a detailed request plus one or two context files, and you’re quickly at ~15,000 input tokens.\n\nOn that workload, the Asus GB10 needs under ~3 seconds to process the ~15k-token input and then starts generating at roughly 55–60 tok/s. The Strix Halo, meanwhile, takes just under ~30 seconds before it even begins generating, at around ~50 tok/s. You see the difference?\n\nIn other words, the GB10 can read 15,000 tokens and generate a bit more than 1500 tokens of output before the Strix Halo has started writing anything.\n\nAnd that’s where the GB10 really shines with VLLM : if, for example, someone is chatting with GPT-OSS-120B while you’re coding, performance doesn’t get cut in half. It typically drops by only a few percent.",

Pretty much all the laptops, and some of the MiniPC's won't give a Strix Halo the full power budget that it wants, and so one review may show it running badly, while another shows it running well.\n\n2.200€ for a Strix Halo seems surprisingly high priced.  You should be able to get the 128GB models for around the US$2000 mark, so whatever that converts to in Euro (\\~1700EUR)",

If FP8 kernel fails, it errors out instead of silently switching.\n* Tensor-parallel (NCCL) + CUDA graphs for decode (also support eager mode)\n\n# Benchmarks (RTX 4090)\n\n**Qwen3-8B-NVFP4**\n\n|batch|total tokens|seconds|tok/s|peak GB|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|128|3.3867|37.79|7.55|\n|2|256|3.5471|72.17|7.55|\n|4|512|3.4392|148.87|7.55|\n|8|1024|3.4459|297.16|7.56|\n|16|2048|4.3636|469.34|7.56|\n\n**Gemma3-27B-it-NVFP4**\n\n|batch|total tokens|seconds|tok/s|peak GB|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|128|9.3982|13.62|19.83|\n|2|256|9.5545|26.79|19.83|\n|4|512|9.5344|53.70|19.84|\n\nfor Qwen3-8B-NVFP4 I observed \\~2.4x lower peak VRAM vs Qwen3-8B FP16 baselines (with \\~20-25% throughput loss).\n\n# Quickstart\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/BenChaliah/NVFP4-on-4090-vLLM.git\n    \n    adallm serve nvidia/Qwen3-8B-NVFP4\n\n>\\`export NVFP4\\_FP8=1\\` is optional and enables FP8 GEMM path (NVFP4\\_FP8=0: the difference is in compute precision not VRAM, FP8 KV cache + the FP8 decode kernel are still used.\n\n**Supported models (so far)**\n\n* `nvidia/Qwen3-8B-NVFP4`\n* `BenChaliah/Gemma3-27B-it-NVFP4`\n* Qwen3 MoE variants are supported, but still slow (see README for MoE notes).\n\n**Limitations**\n\n* MoE routing and offload paths are not fully optimized yet (working on it currently)\n* Only NVFP4 weights, no FP16 fallback for decode by design.\n* Targeted at Ada Lovelace (sm\\_89).

      "text": "For all TLDR:\n\n Qwen3 8b-vl is the best in its weight class for recognizing formatted text (even better than Mistral 14b with OCR).\n\nFor others:\n\nHi everyone, this is my first post. I wanted to discuss my observations regarding LLMs with OCR capabilities.\n\nWhile developing a utility for automating data processing from documents, I needed to extract text from specific areas of documents. Initially, I thought about using OCR, like Tesseract, but I ran into the issue of having no control over the output. Essentially, I couldn't recognize the text and make corrections (for example, for surnames) in a single request.\n\nI decided to try Qwen3 8b-vl. It turned out to be very simple. The ability to add data to the system prompt for cross-referencing with the recognized text and making corrections on the fly proved to be an enormous killer feature. You can literally give it all the necessary data, the data format, and the required output format for its response. And you get a response in, say, a JSON format, which you can then easily convert into a dictionary (if we're talking about Python).\n\nI tried Mistral 14b, but I found that its text recognition on images is just terrible with the same settings and system prompt (compared to Qwen3 8b-vl). Smaller models are simply unusable. Since I'm sending single requests without saving context, I can load the entire model with a 4k token context and get a stable, fast response processed on my GPU.\n\nIf people who work on extracting text from documents using LLMs (visual text extraction) read this, I'd be happy to hear about your experiences.\n\nFor reference, my specs:\nR7 5800X\nRTX 3070 8GB\n32GB DDR4",

Extrapolate meaningful entries in the file, and create a dashboard using NextJS that displays that data in a meaningful format\".\n\nI did try to find something along these lines, but the vast majority of the results have just been slop, comparing features of the tooling without actually going into a deep dive on how the tooling performs for concrete, measurable instructions, or just displaying the \n\nSomething like this could allow us to actually have a tooling comparison instead of a model comparison per se. \n\nMy gut is telling me that this analysis will have a surprising conclusion, with clear winners on what model compared with what tool provides the best results. i.e GLM4.7-flash works best when paired with Claude Code and worst when paired with Cline based on <metric that was used to evaluate all model/tooling combos>. Or, gpt-oss works best when paired with OpenCode and worst with Qwen Coder.\n\n  \nI'm open to doing the research myself, but was wondering if anyone before bothered doing something like this before I spend the time. \n\n  \nThank you",

It would deprecate quickly due to the pace of change the big 3 are shipping new models. By the time you finish your first rigorous benchmark openAI, Google, and Anthropic will probably have a new model ready to be launched. \n\nI would add a caveat, I think you’re burying the lead a little bit or maybe you haven’t considered it - the memory costs of AI and AI token generation of enterprise and consumers is going to likely 100x in 2026 compared to just last year. That’s a real problem and finding efficiency gains like this might matter more than you think. Right it’s not just humans increasing the cost of AI now it’s Agents who can out produce humans in terms of pure token generation with workflows. It could honestly be 1000x in the aggregate. The real question becomes how do we train the Agents to operate in the “efficient frontier” of 2026 and in the future. And it seems like the big 3 are aware that’s what needs to happen it’s just that they CANT STOP SCALING even if it’s looking flat now.",

Not just does it run but things like: lines of code changed, build errors introduced, how many iterations needed, time to completion, whether it actually solves the stated problem vs going off track 3.\n\n\nFor the validation step, you might want to look at something like Zencoder Zenflow since it has spec-driven workflows with built-in verification loops that can measure drift between requirements and implementation. That could give you actual quantifiable data on how far each tool/model combo strays from the original prompt 4. Document everything in a spreadsheet with timestamps and iteration counts.\n\n\nScreenshots help too for when things go sideways 5. Run each combo at least 3 times since LLMs can be inconsistent The hardest part is gonna be keeping variables controlled. Same prompt wording, same model temp settings, same time of day even (API performance varies).\n\n\nBut yeah if you do this please share the results because the community desperately needs this kinda analysis instead of just vibes-based recommendations.",

I've been looking at the Minimax M2.5 architecture - it's a 10B active parameter model that's somehow hitting 80.2% on SWE-Bench Verified. That is SOTA territory for models five times its size. This is the Real World Coworker we've been waiting for: something that costs $1 for an hour of intensive work. If you read their RL technical blog, it's clear they're prioritizing tool-use and search (76.3% on BrowseComp) over just being a \"chatty\" bot. For those of us building real systems, the efficiency of Minimax is a far more interesting technical achievement than just adding more weights to a bloated transformer.",

You can get a quantized (shrunk) version of it to run on a ultra-high-spec Mac Studio M4 Ultra with 512GB of unified RAM, but that's a $15k machine.\n\nThe closest normal human model that's kinda/sorta in the ballpark of Gemini might be the new **Qwen3-Coder-Next-80B** that came out last week.  It requires 60-80GB of VRAM.  I think your RTX5070 has 12GB.  The system ram on AMD/Intel systems is too slow for AI work, so it's just not going to work on anything short of a $4k machine.  My friend has a dual-3090 GPU setup and it's basically minimum tolerable speed on that.\n\nI mean if you had 64GB of system RAM, it might RUN, but it'll be AWFUL (like waiting 5 minutes for a simple prompt).\n\nI have it running on a Mac with a M1 Max processor and 64GB of unified memory.  That's the minimum-minimum spec, I have to keep the system stripped down and running nothing but the LLM to have enough RAM, but it works.\n\nFor the most capable local \"coder\" that will work in your system as a hobby/plaything would be maybe Qwen3-Coder 30B with heavy CPU offload.\n\nIt's pretty easy to try.  Download LMStudio, it's point and click.  Then search for \"coder\" models and stay below 30b.  It'll bitch and moan about even that big a model (that's a 20gb download I think), but it will probably work if you slide the offload slider a bunch.\n\nI think as fast a system as you have, it'll run... slow but maybe tolerably well.  But won't sniff gemini for quality and capability.\n\nIf you want something quick, stick to like a 8b model on your system that will fit fully in VRAM with decent context.  Problem is those models aren't that smart and will be a bit forgetful and not as skilled at error-free code.",
