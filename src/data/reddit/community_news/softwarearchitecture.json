And I came from a non-IT background, so, I need to do some hardwork and will be slow in catching up to other folks who already know about IT.\n\nNow, I want to start Systems Design. As of now, I am mostly into Data Engineering (most of my work was preparing APIs to fetch data, refine it, store it in Cloud and then, use Cloud Services like AWS Glue to perform ETL services and store it in different endpoints).\n\nMy goal -> Go for full fledged Data Engineering and then becomes a Solutions Architect.\n\nSo, I need to learn Systems Design concepts. And while I will take up some Udemy courses and follow some YouTube channels, I still want to read the concepts using a traditional way. And so, I want at least 1-2 books to read.\n\nAnother thing is, they are asked in the interviews.\n\nSo, (to all the senior folks, or those who have knowledge in this field), please recommend some self-sufficient Systems Design books that I can read. I would prefer 1, but 1-2 books would be okay. If even that is not possible, recommend at least 1 book that will help me with my journey on Systems Design concepts.",

There are boundaries within boundaries, recursively.  Your concept of layers handles only one part of that hierarchy, it assumes a linear stacking, and it's non-recursive.  \n\nCurrently I use Lucid.app for customers.  They have the same problem, but they let me put boundaries on the page in the form of shapes and then let me know stuff inside that boundary.  They also let me group the boundary and its contents and make it manipulable as a unit.  But even Lucid has problems because it doesn't handle multiple levels of boundary properly.\n\nEdit:  \n\nOh, and lines need endpoint symbols like arrow heads to imply inbound/outbound directionality at a minimum.\n\nA description for a shape should be a tooltip that pops up when I hover over the shape in the diagram; at least in 2D view.",

          "text": "Had a co-worker point me to this today. I really like it as a quick prototyping tool, and the 3D view scratches and itch I have to see actual depth in our architecture diagrams across layers.  \n  \nA few suggestions/observations/bug reports in no particular order:  \n1. (Suggestion) I would love to have the ability to upload custom icons for blocks or support icon packs like draw.io has for AWS/Azure/GCP resources.  \n2. (Observation/Suggestion) The alignment and distribute tools work great, but the alignment behavior was a little unexpected for me. Granted, my expectations are coming from draw.io's behavior. When I took a few vertical items and try to align them along their horizontal center, I expected them to align based on the center of the *first* item I selected (this is the default behavior in draw.io). It looks like by default that alignment finds the middle of *all* selected elements. I noticed similar behavior with the left-and right-align, where it chose the left/right-most edge of all the selected blocks as the anchor point for alignment. It doesn't ruin the experience, but as someone who is quite particular about alignment and distribution, thinking about every selected block being relative to *each other* is more difficult than thinking about every selected block being relative to the *first* block selected. Not a problem for quick prototyping, but more important for higher-impact diagrams  \n3. (Suggestion) A light mode would be nice. I often show high-level architecture diagrams to our product team and many of them don't do dark mode UI's. I think the colored-coded borders on the left side of the blocks would show up well in a lighter theme. I did some mediocre inline style editing with my browser devtools to change the workspace background and the background/color of one of the blocks and it looked pretty good.  \n4. (Suggestion) I like the nested layers. I would be interested in seeing \"cross\" layers which could contain blocks across other layers. This would be great for representing-for example-VPC's in AWS which can contain back-end and data resources.\n5. (Bug?) I'm not sure the \"Toggle Interactivity\" button is working. I put it in the \"lock closed\" state, but everything in the diagram could still be interacted with. I may be misunderstanding this feature, too.\n6. (Bug/Suggestion) I colored one of my layers black, and in the 3D view the label and label text were both black. Might want to do a check on the layer color and dynamically use an appropriately contrasting label/text color for accessibility/user error.",

Instead of being coupled by deployments, scaling, autonomy, etc, they're coupled by producer and consumers. It's a very valid tradeoff depending on what you're building. \n\nWhich means, yes, if you're coupling metric is deployability, then it does decouple. \n\n> If I need to talk to you, I don't want a middle man.\n\nThis is naive and implies that all work should and can be done in process. Or that every problem can be solved via in-process, direct HTTP calls (which has it's own issues). \n\n> unless you have very specific constraints like requiring multiple services listening to the same event, or something else.\n\nEvent-driven architecture is simply communicating by events. It doesn't matter if there's a single or 200 services, it's still event-driven if it's communicating via events. And here's the biggest secret about EDA: It's literally the way most domains work. When this happens, then this happens. \n\n\"When a patient is admitted to the hospital, then a notification needs sent to their physician\". That's event-driven. And when you work in non-trivial domains, writing classes with 200 if/else checks starts to become untenable. And communicating via events has the added benefit of not only telling you the what, but the why as well. \n\n>  If your response will take too much time, there are lots of other patterns to use.\n\nYes, like using async messaging via an event-driven architecture.",

              "text": "The problem with using databases as a queue is more to do with the polling interacting with locking/visibility and the way they handle concurrency. If you're not polling by issuing SQL statements you'll be fine. And if your queue is very low throughput and second-level latency is OK you may be fine as well, even if the tool is not a great fit and you can easily write a broken queue.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a high-throughput queue in a database. Your readers do, say  'UPDATE mytable SET processing=TRUE WHERE id=(SELECT id FROM mytable WHERE NOT processing ORDER BY created_at ASC FOR UPDATE LIMIT 1) AND NOT processing RETURNING ...'. If many transactions do this at once they're all going to find the same row and try to lock it. One query gets the queued task and all the others have to sit and wait for it before they can even try to get the next one.\n\nPerhaps SKIP LOCKED would help, but having not tried running it I'm not sure I've got this query exactly right even without it. How does this work with, say, PostgreSQL's MVCC? Will I get UPDATEs which update zero rows? Possibly, if the SELECTs can see a row viewed as it was at the start of the transaction that has since been updated by another concurrent transaction to processing=TRUE. If so, it would have been broken if I hadn't added 'AND NOT processing'.\n\nI imagine heavy writes to a very small part of the index on created_at isn't going to help, either.\n\nYou're not going to have any problems like that if you're just storing what is effectively the message body in a DB and passing references via queues.\n\nThere are other designs for database queues but I don't think you'll find anything safe, easy and high-throughput. At the very least you need to be intimately familiar with your databases locking and performance characteristics and you'll probably still find yourself repeatedly debugging performance bottlenecks.",

We specialize in e-commerce enterprise projects. Most of our projects are between 0.8 and 2 million USD.\n\nPart of my duties is vetting incoming work from the sales team and getting it sized/estimated before a contract is drawn up. What has surprised me is how much guess work is happening at this stage. I'm honestly used to being a delivery team member with several weeks of discovery. Now I'll travel across borders to do preliminary requirements gathering and I'll be lucky if the client gives me 4 hours for a $3mil USD project.\n\nI understand that I'm not truly estimating scope as much as validating rough targets while leaving discovery to the delivery teams. But part of me is stressing about the guess work involved.\n\nWhich leads to my questions for the group:\n- Can you tell me about your experiences with this situation? Is it something similar? Do you have any horror stories (missing requirements)?\n- What does your estimation process look like?\n- How confident are you in your pre discovery estimates?\n- Do you have any requirement gathering activities you like to do with clients?\n\nFull disclosure, I'm working on a tool to make this easier on myself but I wanted to hear how others are facing this.",

Putting it on paper can reveal stuff that they hadn't thought about, or were tertiary but important, but it's gets it all out. Ideally you have designs already, if you don't then make shitty drawings to fill in the gaps and tease out the features being asked for.\n\nThis puts things in boxes. Stuff you've seen before - lots of CRUD work - usually sits in regular looking boxes. You can estimate these easily and there's no surprises, give it an estimate, make it green, move on.\n\nThen there's stuff that's a bit weird, maybe it's CRUD but depends on something you can't control or haven't seen before. Make it orange, divvy it up more, add time boxed discovery, or inflated percentage.\n\nThen there's blue boxes, sane sounding stuff but you haven't done it, it requires inventing things, systems, models, it's a bit faffy. More subdivision of the ask, more inflated numbers.\n\nAnd finally you'll get red boxes. Don't know what it means, don't have enough info, can't be right, can't estimate it.  These are the ones where you get a little surgical and create questions for the stakeholder (customer), and it's good to make them kinda open and get the customer to talk about what they really want. We throw away all sorts of requirements when we go back with open questions and let people talk.\n\nAnd then you pack it all up, look at it from on high, add 10% to the estimate for the customer, cut 10% from what the developer sees.\n\nYou'll also get a different experience if you have a well oiled velocity-dialed team, or a bunch of specialists.  When you have specialists it's good to also throw together a gantt (work swimlanes) to assign who's working on what for how long, align the work blocks, watch people squirm when it's all laid out.\n\nThe more you do it the faster you'll get, you can run these meetings lightning fast and the hardest part is getting developers to be awake and give honest numbers.  Get them to give you realistic numbers, not pleasing numbers. On-high will always squeeze you for cheaper work, don't let the developers squeeze themselves. Remember to ask about testing, UAT, Release plan, definition of done, operation manuals, docs.",

The far you estimate in time, the less accurate your estimates. You can assume typical features required by your customer vertical/industry. Identify things that will need deeper analysis and organize them in future iterations. Use a basic/medium/high complexity score for each feature and assign them some standard development time.\n4. Share risks with your customer. Explain the milestones that need deeper analysis that will be done at the time and may cause the project to extend.\n5. Deliver working features early.\n\nWhat will happen is that your customer will take your proposal with a better mindset.\n\nIn the end you will estimate 8 months and your customer will answer we need it in 3 months.

          "text": "Use Claude to generate a mermaid diagram of your complete system/infra (.mmd) files. Claude is usually very good at this.  If you use a JetBrains IDE they have a .mmd plugin, however; it isn't the best.  Once it is generated you can import it here [https://www.mermaid.ai/](https://www.mermaid.ai/) or [https://miro.com/](https://miro.com/) for easier viewing of large sized diagrams. I would suggest when generating it, use a broader approach for the primary file (high level concepts), and then build out more detailed individual documents for each specific subset.  Mermaid diagrams can start to get a bit wacky as they grow. \n\nOnce you have mapped out the infrastructure you can save it to your repo and then add it as a reference claude must review at the start of each session in your claude.md.  I would also suggest writing instructions to update the diagram whenever any significant changes are made.\n\nI personally haven't needed to add it to the [claude.md](http://claude.md) yet, however; in a few scenarios I have pointed it at the .mmd file.  I mostly work in agentic space so the relationships aren't bonkers just yet.",

If you try to keep everything in one aggregate, depending on the complexity of the bounded context, you're going to have something akin to a god class that is very hard to understand before you start having memory problems (because that aggregate will have to be the entry point to ALL domain behavior).\n\nThere are ways to model the \"a restaurant can’t have more than 50 branches\" rule without having the branch be an entity in the restaurant aggregate. The restaurant has to own that rule, yes, but it only needs to know how many branches it has, not their names, menus, and employees. So the restaurant only holds a list of branch IDs, and it checks their count on an addBranch method. If it needs to be transaction-safe but you don't want to deal with cross-aggregate transactions, you can use a saga or reservation pattern.\n\nBut everything is a trade-off, and you have to make the trade-off analysis yourself. Multiple aggregates might actually make things less readable and more complex if you have a lot of these cross-aggregate rules.",

People filled it out like a checklist to get approval, not to actually think. Same problem you identified with scoring, the form becomes the point instead of the thinking behind it.\n\nHonestly the most useful documentation I've produced is a one-page list of decisions that burned us and why. No framework, just we picked X, it broke because of Y, next time consider Z. New engineers on the team read that page and learn more from it than from any architecture decision record we've ever written.\n\nYour simplicity characteristic weighted high by default is smart though, making boring the default that you have to argue against instead of the other way around would've saved me from a few disasters. We once went with a microservices approach for something that a single postgres instance could've handled for years, took us eight months to unwind that decision.\n\nBut yeah hope that actually answers your question instead of just rambling about my war stories lol",

Based on your core problem, what you described is actually just multi-tenant RBAC, not an auth server problem.\n\nNote: I used AI to help me structure and format this response clearly, but the architecture approach and experience shared here are based on my own implementation work.\n\nI’ve implemented a complete RBAC system from scratch for a logistics management company, and the key is separating what’s static vs what’s dynamic.\n\nFor this part, each restaurant should be able to manage its own roles independently. Don’t make permissions dynamic.  \n  \nMake **permissions static**, and roles dynamic per tenant. Define all possible actions in your system as static keys in code order: create, order, view, order: delete, sales: view, driver: assign.   \n  \nThese never change at runtime. They’re referenced in both frontend and backend checks.\n\nThen each restaurant (tenant) can create whatever roles they want and attach those static permissions to them.\n\nRestaurant A:\n\n* Cashier → order: view, sales: view\n\nRestaurant B:\n\n* CounterGuy → order: create\n\nSame permission set. Different combinations. No conflict.\n\nOn the permission check side\n\nYou’re right, don’t hit the DB on every request.\n\nYou’ve got two clean options\n\n**Cache roles + permissions**  \nOn login, load everything and stick it in Redis or memory.  \nAt request time, just check the cached set.\n\n**Put permissions in the JWT**  \nAt login, fetch permissions and embed them in the token.\n\nThen every request\n\n* Validate JWT\n* Check if the permission key exists\n* No DB\n* No cache\n* Extremely scalable\n\nThe tradeoff is that you can’t instantly revoke access unless you invalidate sessions or force re-login. For most SaaS apps, that’s fine.\n\nIf you need instant revocation, use short-lived tokens + refresh tokens or a cache layer.",
