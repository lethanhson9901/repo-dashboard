      "text": "Originally, Uncle Bob did not teach these principles in the order people know today. His friend Michael Feathers, the author of Working Effectively with Legacy Code, pointed out that if you arrange them in a certain sequence, you get the word SOLID. That sequence is what we ended up learning.\n\n# The problem is the order itself\n\nThe idea should start with **D**. Inverting the dependencies or, the dependency rule. High-level policy must not depend on low-level details.\n\n[The interface inside the business rules layer](https://preview.redd.it/kmkoyik4xujg1.png?width=2323&format=png&auto=webp&s=3042b2a2a91fdb2299eecc50c8b31750c6758245)\n\nHigh-level policy is the business rules, the reason the system exists. Low-level details are the database, message broker, third-party frameworks, and delivery channels like Web APIs or desktop UIs.\n\nOnce D is set correctly, **O** and **L** are consequences. The system becomes open for extension and closed for modification because you can swap a message broker without modifying the core. As such, you can replace a concrete implementation at runtime without changing the code. That’s Liskov substitution.\n\nThese principles emerge when dependencies point in the right direction.\n\n[Code dependencies point against the flow of control](https://preview.redd.it/lpn76srnxujg1.png?width=2542&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e358ce67c427d364e61035b4db3060fb6abf5c4)\n\nThe **I** principle often drives systems toward shallow modules. Instead of one deep abstraction, you get fragmented contracts that push responsibility back to the caller. The shallow modules is taken from A Philosophy of Software Design book.\n\n[Deep modules & shallow modules](https://preview.redd.it/1d0drzbwxujg1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8f69e7e76432049cc77819b6089f8ac057c0858)\n\nWhen interface segregation is applied mechanically, it creates coordination code. Over time, especially in large teams, this leads to brittle designs where complexity is spread everywhere instead of being contained.\n\nThe most ambiguous part is **S**. Most people think it means a class should do one thing. This confusion is reinforced by Clean Code, where the same author says code should do one thing and do it well. What becomes clear when reading Clean Architecture book is that S is not a code-level thing.\n\n[Design by volatility](https://preview.redd.it/3b15znw8yujg1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=266cfd9ac9a4b4bd5a02620ba95574ad6d6391df)\n\nWhen decomposing a system into components, the idea is to look for sources of change. A source of change can be an admin, a retail user, a support agent, or an HR role.\n\n[Components separation](https://preview.redd.it/gq4m3iimyujg1.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c5933e8af112491dfaf94ac56bc7f299f73dedc)\n\nA component should have a single reason to change, which means aligning it with one source of change. This is about deciding what assemblies your system should have so work does not get intermingled across teams.\n\n# The takeaway\n\nThe main idea is the dependency rule, not a trendy word like SOLID. That’s how i see it today. It took me years to get here, and I'm open to change my mind.",

Everything has multiple sources of change. \n\nAccounting wants a new value in the report. The CEO prefers last name first. The report is too slow to generate and must be performance tuned. \n\nShould there really be a 1:1 relationship between change requests and modules? No it’s naive. It’s better to consider the underlying principle at play: cohesion.  \n\nModules should be designed with high cohesion in mind; once understood, you don’t need a pithy rule of thumb like “one reason to change”",

Then ⁠ ϕ (y) should be true for objects ⁠ y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\n\nIt's a requirement for designing a correct type hierarchy. Notably this principle has a different perspective than type theory requirements for subtypes (contravariance of parameters & Co variance of returns), it's getting into the notion of **behavioural subtyping**. This is undecidable in general but the point of the principle is that you, the programmer, have to uphold the behavioural contract when creating a subtype. \n\n\nA general example is a subtype that overrides a method to have an infinite loop randomly. It type checks fine, the behaviour is undecidable statically at compile time, and you the programmer have violated the principle by introducing that behavioural incompatibility with the super type. \n\n\nThis is specifically about subtyping and has nothing to do with dynamically calling an implementation of a trait/typeclass/interface at runtime. That's just dynamic dispatch which is a built-in feature of most languages today",

          "text": "I would say the order only matters when one is more a problem for you and I think the purposes of each are much simpler and mor general than this.\n\n\nWhat I've found each idea has been most useful for:\n\n- Single Responsibility, if a single piece of code is handling logic for many aspects of a system, when you change it you have a higher risk of breaking more aspects of the system so may be better if its broken up, it is also useful as a counterpoint to DRY meaning if code looks the same but it serves different purposes then it may be better to just have the code repeated, an indicator you haven't followed it when it might've been useful is if you start adding if-else logic to a method to make it behave differently for one stream of data than the others that use it, like the opposite of shotgun surgery.\n\n- Open/Closed, this is about designing things to have less of a need to change for existing consumers, so if you want to add more behaviour or more options you don't break how the existing consumers of your work, e.g. instead of an internal switch statement just take anyone who implements a certain interface, like the visitor and strategy patterns, or instead of taking unique arguments that get acted on you might consider taking a list that gets iterated on so the list can be added to. This is especially important for libraries and other forms of public APIs, if you follow this principle well then the API consumers will have much less issues.\n\n- Liskov Substitution - This is just about making sure child classes handle the contract of their parents predictably, a common way this gets broken is that people will override a parent classes method just to throw an exception saying its not allowed on the child, this means that consumers of those classes may be surprised if accept the parent and cater for the parent but someone provides this outlier child, you'll likely end up with more errors in your app.\n\n- Interface Segregation - This is more about not having god interfaces, this happens when interfaces aren't serving a specific enough purpose, a good example is xunit's IAsyncLifetime, because it is the only owner of InitializeAsync, but it also has DisposeAsync there are many instances of people having a DisposeAsync method in their test classes that is just a passthrough, if however there were an IAsyncInitializable interface this problem wouldn't occur (obviously it encourages some people to dispose what they create as many forget this so it does serve some purpose but that's a different debate)\n\n- Dependency Inversion - This is really just about passing in what you use instead of both creating it and using it in the same space, and is especially useful for external dependencies, its primarily to reduce coupling, meaning you can use different dependencies for the same service/utility more easily and you can use a service/utility in more different places if you want, also I find most people use it these days for testing, in that for your test you can just pass in a mock or fake instead of the real thing and your test can potentially be much faster and simpler (though many people use this to make their test more complex, but that goes to my final point below)\n\n\nThe problem I notice more often these days is, people applying these princples just because they were told it's \"best practice\" and you end up with the old enterprise fizzbuzz pattern. I think its more important to try and understand when and where these are beneficial and apply them only where the benefit is clear or it's simpler to apply than not, if applying a princple adds complexity without clear benefit then it might not be a good option.",

          "text": ">you get the word SOLID. That sequence is what we ended up learning.\n\n>The problem is the order itself\n\nI'm a bit confused about the assertion that the order of SOLID is somehow significant. It's just meant to be a mnemonic, it doesn't intend to order the principles in any useful way.\n\nI think the most fundamental of these principles is LSP. I'm sure there are arguments to be had about the relative importance of the SOLID principles, but LSP is the one that the others depend upon getting right. If you don't know how to properly implement the behavioral contract of an interface, then inverting dependencies by introducing interfaces isn't going to get you too far.\n\n>As such, you can replace a concrete implementation at runtime without changing the code. That’s Liskov substitution.\n\nI think you're conflating LSP with a thing that proper use of LSP enables, but it's not the only purpose of LSP.\n\nLSP basically says that the behavioral contract specified by a type must not be violated by a subtype. The canonical example of violating LSP is letting Square extend Rectangle. In math, a \"square is a rectangle,\" but in OOD, a square does not behave the same way a rectangle does:\n\n    @Test\n    void testArea() {\n      Rectangle r = new Rectangle();\n      r.setWidth(3);\n      r.setLength(4);\n      assertThat(r.getArea()).isEqualTo(12);\n    }\n\nIf you try to treat a Square instance polymorphically as type Rectangle, this test will never pass because a square is behaviorally not a rectangle.\n\nBasically, LSP says that whatever behavior that's specified by an interface, the subtype must conform. It can play within a more restricted area allowed by the contract, but it may not stray outside those bounds.\n\n>Once D is set correctly, **O** and **L** are consequences. The system becomes open for extension and closed for modification because you can swap a message broker without modifying the core.\n\nI don't think this really gets at that core of what the Open-Closed Principle is all about. I think folks approach it as a kind of \"practice,\" like when new requirements come in, you should try to figure out a way to extend the existing code rather than modify it, but the principle itself doesn't give much guidance on how to design a system that actually makes this possible. It just leaves it to the architect to consult your crystal ball.\n\nWhat OCP is really saying is this: A design should define the roots of your dependency DAG around the most stable business entities and concepts.\n\nIn other words, if you're writing banking software, then there are certain things about the banking business that were true yesterday, they're true today, and they'll be true fifty years from now. Your system has customers, and those customers have accounts, and those accounts have balances. This means that the bank software should define a customer entity that *only* specifies the core, stable properties of a customer, the same goes for accounts. Can a customer exist that doesn't yet have accounts, does that make sense? Yes. Can an account exist that doesn't belong to any customer? No, that doesn't really make sense. So the system should be able to represent a customer without the concept of an account existing, and the account entity can depend on the customer entity. An intrinsic property of an account is a balance, so this core concept of account can declare balance as a property.\n\nNow let's say someone comes along and wants to add a bunch of user preference columns to the Customer DB table, users can specify dark mode on the bank UI, and they like the date formatted this way, etc, etc. By putting these things that might change into the core Customer entity, you're now allowing everything that depends on that entity to also become aware and form dependencies on all this new stuff that might or might not exist ten versions from now. That's bad. Instead, create a UserPreferences table and put all that stuff there, and let it depend upon the Customer table. Now only things that care about UserPreferences will bother depending on it, and everything else that doesn't care about that info doesn't need to be aware of it. This is an example of OCP, extend by adding, not modifying.\n\nThe exception to OCP is when your design doesn't mirror the actual problem domain correctly. Maybe one of the core aspects of a Customer didn't make it into your design, but should have. In that case, you shouldn't try to extend the current design, you should modify the Customer entity so it reflects reality. It's difficult to understand the problem domain, so this will happen, and a good architect is constantly learning and incorporating what they learn into the system. The architect should understand the problem domain well enough to understand where the joints are, and the system should carve the problem domain at its joints, so to speak.\n\n>The **I** principle often drives systems toward shallow modules. Instead of one deep abstraction, you get fragmented contracts that push responsibility back to the caller. The shallow modules is taken from A Philosophy of Software Design book.\n\nI don't agree with this at all. If you look at Ousterhout's diagram, the \"deep\" module has a smaller, more focused interface than the \"shallow\" module. This is exactly in line with the ISP, which says to separate interfaces into smaller, more focused contracts. What Ousterhout is objecting to is abstractions that specify overly simple contracts, basically the overuse of abstraction.\n\nOne of the problems I have with his book is that it hasn't really crystallized a philosophy. It does do a good job talking about his personal philosophy of software design, but I think many of the principles in there are not defined sharply enough to be applicable and they rely too much on the reader's judgment to be an \"objective\" kind of philosophy, if that makes sense. Also, I think he muddies the waters a bit by setting up some of his principles in opposition to other ways of doing things when I feel like he hasn't really deeply understood the thing he's trying to refute, such as the shallow/deep vs. ISP … these are not really opposed.\n\nThe last one is dependency inversion and I'll discuss that in a [separate comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/softwarearchitecture/comments/1r6aglp/comment/o5uaq37/).",

              "text": "I do think that DIP is one of the most critical principles for a great OO architecture, but I feel like it's often misunderstood.\n\nIn the diagram you present where the Data subsystem depends upon the Business subsystem, that gestures in the right direction but leaves out some critical details.\n\nThe first thing that's often misunderstood about DIP is that people think Martin is talking about the n-tier architecture when he talks about the \"layers\" of the system. He's not. In your diagram, you've depicted a business logic layer and a data access layer, and you're probably imagining a presentation layer above the business logic layer, and the web client above that, right? This is the wrong picture.\n\nIf you read his white paper closely, you'll see that he's dividing up the system not according to these tiers, but rather he's talking about policy layers, mechanism layers, and utility layer. If you conflate these \"layers\" with the n-tier architecture of most web apps, you're getting it wrong. Think about the business logic tier, if you parse a string into a URL. That code uses a string utility. If you authenticate a user in order to service the request, you're using the auth module and that's probably a mechanism or utility, and it's also code in that same tier. Maybe you get a request and use a promise pattern to kick off async processing for different things that need to happen…that code managing that async processing isn't \"policy\" stuff, it's infrastructure you're using.\n\nThe way he's viewing a system for the purpose of presenting DIP is completely orthogonal to the n-tier architecture most people think he's talking about. He's not saying that, though. He's saying that when your business logic layer gets a user request and the first thing it does is authenticate that user, it should not call directly into the auth system you wrote and have all that auth stuff on its classpath. It should call into an interface, and the compilation dependency of this subsystem on auth should end there, at that auth API.\n\nThe other big thing people get wrong about DIP is how the abstractions that enable inversion are packaged. If you consider this subsystem that processes user requests, which needs to authenticate the user before servicing the request, it depends on the Auth interface, right? If that auth interface is packaged with its implementation, then a dependency on the interface is a dependency on the deployment unit (a jar, say) that contains all of that implementation code. This means that entire auth jar needs to build as a compilation dependency of this subsystem anyway.\n\nSo you cannot package the abstraction with the implementation, because in order to build and deploy that abstraction in a form for clients to use, the entire auth subsystem has to be built. So instead you package it with the subsystem that uses it, as you have depicted in your diagram. Problem solved, right?\n\nNope. Now the auth subsystem implements an interface in the deployment jar of this other subsystem, and in order to build the auth subsystem, this client of the auth subsystem needs to be built first.\n\nThe takeaway is that you cannot package the abstractions with the implementations nor with the clients. They must be packaged separately. This way, the build system builds those, packages them up, and makes them available to dependencies, which include *both* clients of the interface as well as implementations of it. This is harder than it seems, because that means all dependencies in that API package need to be included in it, and those cannot depend on anything outside either.\n\nIf you haven't set up a system where you can compile the interface independently, then the client and implementations independent of each other, you've inverted the dependency in a hypothetical sense, but you're not getting any benefit from having created these abstractions. You haven't shortened your classpath, you haven't sped up your compiles, you haven't done much of anything. This is something Ousterhout talks about in his book, explaining that he hasn't yet seen a system that really benefits much from DI. That's true, but it's not because DI is bad, it's because people don't actually invert dependency correctly.",

I had recently worked with a team on a worker service that consume a kafka topic and writes the records to several db tables. The team thinking of segregating the interfaces, created an interface for each entity, and i have done that for long. Having a single database port made things simpler, the port implementation acted as a usb port, you know following the hexagonal architecture pattern.\n\nOn dependency inversion, i think it is the most important one and vote for focusing on the dependency rule instead. Most engineers i talk to, mention dependency injection which is the framework that should be a detail. Your point about having the interface in its own assembly and not having it inside the business rules is well taken sir. \n\nThe order SOLID is the problem since most of education starts with the S, which is very ambiguous.   \nIf we can all invert the dependency properly and isolate the core, we would be in a better place.",

Reading how these teams document decisions is more valuable than any template.\n\n• **Design verification tools** \\- ArchUnit (Java), arkitect (PHP), arch-go, konsist (Kotlin), dependency-cruiser (JS/TS). Architecture rules that run in CI, not rot in Confluence.\n\n• **Case studies over theory** \\- Shopify's modular monolith, Discord's Cassandra→ScyllaDB migration, Figma's CRDT-based multiplayer, Stripe's API versioning approach.\n\n• **Reference implementations** \\- not toy examples but production-grade repos with DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing across Go, PHP, C#.\n\n[https://github.com/QDenka/awesome-software-design](https://github.com/QDenka/awesome-software-design)\n\n\n\nCurious what resources shaped your approach to software design the most?

That reframe alone would've saved me from a few bad decisions early on.\n\nOne thing I keep running into though - the RFC process works great when people actually have the context to evaluate options. But in practice, the architectural knowledge needed to write a good RFC (system boundaries, existing decisions, dependency chains) is often locked in someone's head or scattered across old docs.\n\nThe \"nobody comments\" problem you mentioned? I think a one of the reason might be people \"can't\" comment meaningfully because they don't have enough visibility into the system to know if Option B will break something three services away. Could they be just hesitant?\n\nThanks for writing this up.",

              "text": "Thanks for the write up OP.\n\nIMO priorities should really be decided on before an RFC is presented. IME decision meetings can get off track and end up purely about the priorities. Especially in orgs where people (leadership incl.) don't read the RFCs in advance of decision meetings. My ideal approach is to approach stakeholders well before the RFC is presented and gather business priorities before exploring any options in an RFC, otherwise it can be a serious waste of time. \n\nI also like to include a list of \"non-priorities\". The latter in particular helped keep conversations on track (assuming we all agreed on them).\n\nI will say, given enough time I think people can gain context but the environment has to allow it. For example if there's a weekly/bi-weekly time blocked for presenting RFCs, each team can assign a representative and ideally that individual is given the time and space to gain the context needed, as questions and leave comments well before the meeting.\n\nIf they're not commenting consistently IMO that may be work environment issue.",

There are boundaries within boundaries, recursively.  Your concept of layers handles only one part of that hierarchy, it assumes a linear stacking, and it's non-recursive.  \n\nCurrently I use Lucid.app for customers.  They have the same problem, but they let me put boundaries on the page in the form of shapes and then let me know stuff inside that boundary.  They also let me group the boundary and its contents and make it manipulable as a unit.  But even Lucid has problems because it doesn't handle multiple levels of boundary properly.\n\nEdit:  \n\nOh, and lines need endpoint symbols like arrow heads to imply inbound/outbound directionality at a minimum.\n\nA description for a shape should be a tooltip that pops up when I hover over the shape in the diagram; at least in 2D view.",

During that time, I saw patterns across hundreds of teams - what works, what doesn't, and where teams typically struggle.\n\n\n\nI'm now working on some ideas in the developer tooling space and I'm really interested in learning more about the real-world architecture challenges that teams are facing today. Specifically curious about:\n\n\n\n\\- Teams going through refactoring or re-architecture \n\n\\- Common pain points when scaling backend systems\n\n\\- Architecture decisions that are hard to make without senior input\n\n\\- Challenges freelancers/contractors face with architecture\n\n\n\nIf you're dealing with any of these, I'd love to hear about what you're working on and exchange thoughts. I find that the best way to understand problems is through real conversations, not theoretical discussions.\n\n\n\nHappy to share what I learned at AWS and hear what challenges you're facing. No sales pitch - genuinely just want to understand the space better.\n\n\n\nDrop a comment or DM if you'd like to chat!",

          "text": "Avoiding a wall of default infrastructure metrics is exactly the right instinct, CPU and memory have their place but they rarely explain why users are unhappy or whether the architecture itself is under stress. What has worked well for me in my last projects is designing around a few simple questions instead of a giant grid of graphs like \"are we slower than we should be\", and if so, \"what are we waiting on?\", etc, shift our perspective a bit as software engineers\n\nWhen responses start stretching, the service you're staring at usually isn't the real problem, it's waiting on something else like a database call, a cache lookup, another internal service, some external API or dependency. That's why if you can see how a request's time is actually broken down across those hops you can pinpoint where the issue is, which is why we even bother with this observability stuff in the first place.\n\nOn my projects I care a lot about knowing how close we are to an actual bottleneck so I can sleep at night, because a service can sit at 70-80% and be perfectly stable,what worries me is when utilization is high and you see in-flight requests climbing, connection pools filling up, queue depth increasing and latency starting to stretch under the same load. This is the combination that usually means you're no longer just \"busy\", you're hitting a constraint somewehre and the system is starting to amplify it. From an architectural standpoint, that's a very different signal than a box that's simply working hard.\n\nIf I were doing this from scratch, I'd optimize for direction. When something feels off, you should be able to open a dashboard and quickly answer \"are users actually slower\", \"which layer stretched first\", and \"what is it waiting on\"? If your setup makes those answers obvious, you're in good shape. You can also add facts to the questions list that ensure your system is healthy, think of it as conditions and targets that the system always needs to behave and achieve otherwise probably something's off, that's why it's hard to simply give you a set of questions, a lot of it is also thinking around your project's business model so you can have a strategy that makes more sense, at least in terms of priority when you're just starting\n\nI very recently helped write an article that walks through a concrete example of this approach if you want to take a look (it focuses a lot on setting stuff up but the mental flow in there should help you a bit in the process of creating the list of questions you're looking for)\n\n[https://arg-software.medium.com/how-we-debug-slow-microservices-in-18-minutes-not-4-hours-a-prometheus-opentelemetry-guide-0d7b551d1722](https://arg-software.medium.com/how-we-debug-slow-microservices-in-18-minutes-not-4-hours-a-prometheus-opentelemetry-guide-0d7b551d1722)\n\nThe article is obviously only one slice of observability, it can go much deeper. I'm always interested in what other teams rely on as their early warning signals and to discuss and learn from them.",

      "text": "I’m preparing for a system design interview with Airbnb and working through this system design interview question:\n\n**Design a real-time chat system (similar to an in-app messaging feature) that supports:**\n\n* 1:1 and group conversations\n* Real-time delivery over WebSockets (or equivalent)\n* Message persistence and history sync\n* Read receipts (at least per-user “last read”)\n* Multi-device users (same user logged in on multiple clients)\n* High availability / disaster recovery considerations\n\nAdditional requirement:\n\n* The system must **optimize for the Top N “hottest” group chats** (e.g., groups with extremely high message throughput and/or many concurrently online participants). Explain what “hot” means and how you detect it.\n\nThe interviewer expects particular attention to:\n\n* A clear high-level architecture\n* A concrete **data schema** (tables/collections, keys, indexes)\n* How messages get routed when you have **multiple WebSocket gateway servers**\n* Scalability and performance trade-offs\n\nHere’s how I approach this question:\n\n1️⃣ High-level architecture\n\n\\- WebSocket gateway layer (stateless, horizontally scalable)\n\n\\- Chat service (message validation + fanout)\n\n\\- Message persistence (e.g. sharded DB)\n\n\\- Redis for:\n\n\\- online user registry\n\n\\- hot group detection\n\n\\- Message queue (Kafka / similar) for decoupling fanout from write path\n\n2️⃣ Routing problem (multiple WS gateways)\n\nMy assumption:\n\n\\- Each WebSocket server keeps an in-memory map of connected users\n\n\\- A distributed presence store (Redis) maps user\\_id → gateway\\_id\n\n\\- For group fanout:\n\n\\- Publish message to topic\n\n\\- Gateways subscribed to relevant partitions push to local users\n\n3️⃣ Detecting “hot groups”\n\nDefinition candidates:\n\n\\- Message rate per group (messages/sec)\n\n\\- Concurrent online participants\n\n\\- Fanout cost (messages × online members)\n\nUse sliding window counters + sorted set to track Top N groups.\n\nQuestion:\n\nIs this usually pre-computed continuously, or triggered reactively once thresholds are exceeded?\n\n4️⃣ Hot group optimization ideas\n\n\\- Dedicated partitions per hot group\n\n\\- Separate fanout workers\n\n\\- Batch push\n\n\\- Tree-based fanout\n\n\\- Push via multicast-like strategy\n\n\\- Precomputed membership snapshots\n\n\\- Backpressure + rate limiting\n\nI’d love feedback on:\n\n1. What’s the cleanest way to route messages across multiple WebSocket gateways without turning Redis into a bottleneck?\n2. For very hot groups (10k+ concurrent users), is per-user fanout the wrong abstraction?\n3. Would you dynamically re-shard hot groups?\n4. What are the common failure modes people underestimate in chat systems?\n\nAppreciate any critique — especially from folks who’ve built messaging systems at scale.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjps693cz7jg1.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2eac5aeea770fef5c937df3bac36afed38cba26\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/system-design-real-time-chat-hot-groups-airbnb-interview-v0-om4rb91rv7jg1.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=42b0786d8e45ee89ef5249435ba03e6e123f6b7b)\n\nResource: [PracHub](https://prachub.com/?utm_source=reddit)",

The data wants to be stored in a place that's cost-efficient for low volume on reads\n\nBesides this, I'd consider AWS S3 with IA or Glacier, depending on how fast you need the data (consider adding this and data size to your question, by the way). If you don't need the data fast it could be alright. You could query with AWS Athena.\n\nIf you need the cold data for analytics, it could be an option to also create snapshots of the calculated data as an aggregate for a period, using the lowest required period. So, for example, if you only need granularity down to a day then you could have that calculation for the day stored and use that for the calculations rather than every single invoice. Think of like caching AWS Athena results.\n\nUltimately, you'll probably end up having to calculate how much each of these will cost you.",

In the future, we will have filters, but at the moment the solution focuses on an API without filtering capabilities.\n\nThe API retrieves data from two tables:  \n1 – the invoice headers table;  \n2 – the invoice header transactions table.\n\nThe API response is a JSON containing the header plus its transactions.\n\nThe query logic is quite simple: a straightforward `SELECT` with a `WHERE` clause filtering by due date and account to retrieve the header. With the header ID found, it then retrieves the transactions associated with that header, which consists of another simple `SELECT`.\n\nWhen an invoice closes (after one month), those header and transaction records become immutable in these tables. The idea, then, is to remove them from PostgreSQL and move them to cold storage, because over time these closed invoice records are queried less and less in the database. Someone would only query an invoice from 2018 if they really wanted to check what they purchased in that specific month/year. Queries will be higher for current invoices and recently closed ones, and will decrease as time goes by.\n\nThe number of requests for a recently closed invoice can reach around 3,500 req/s, and then gradually decrease over time to 3,000, 1,000, 500, 100 req/s. Hot data, on the other hand, can reach 5,000–6,000 req/s, which is supported by RDS with proper indexing in PostgreSQL.",

Though I don't doubt that some companies would be better off if they used a formula.\n\nArchitecture is the phenomena of two or more systems interacting with eachother. This could be modules within an application, two independent services, or two massive tech companies linking together.\n\nArchitecture happens whether or not an architect is present. Architects are masters of this phenomena, and understand how systems behave in a given environment.\n\nSo a couple of things here:\n1) Being a good architect means understanding your environment, constraints, and problem space.\n2) Improving this requires more knowledge and experience in seeing how different systems interact. Not just technology, but people systems as well.\n3) It is very difficult to get solid architectural experience from a tutorial, course, or book. So much of the work is hands on and in the weeds.\n4) The variations on each of the factors in the real world are immense. Most architects specialize in atleast an industry. Retail, SaaS, FinTech, MedTech, etc.\n5) Look at the pinned megathread for more resources if you want to keep learning, but lived experience will always be better.

Perhaps also accompanied by deliberate learning.\n\nYou **could** set yourself up by at least learning about the things you should be aware of. It seems you're already thinking about architectural characteristics, which is good, but I invite you to also consider things beyond tech: the business as a whole.\n\nPersonally, I benefited quite a bit from picking up some business analysis and project management skills, like going through Eliyahu Goldratt's literature or TOGAF. TOGAF in specific is super overkill for any project I ever worked on, but learning about it and its concepts - which cover enterprise in general, way beyond IT - helped me have a more holistic view to interpret business situations and come up with software solutions that actually fit the businesses I work with.\n\nKind of a random idea, and it's something I try to **not** do to avoid working for free, but could be useful if you just want to practice the muscle: Go through a list of RFPs or software development project posts and see what you can come up with for how you'd approach a system based on what the business person says on the post/specs. You could probably also find similar exercises online and compare them with the answers. I find myself consulting AWS's architecture blog posts more and more often nowadays, e.g. this one: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/building-a-third-party-saas-metering-and-billing-integration-on-aws/ (I was building something similar, then compared it against what they were doing to learn new things)",

Use expiring tokens and rotate signing keys on a defined schedule so that exposed credentials cannot be reused indefinitely. “ \n\nThis is so true , I was part of the support team on a Fintech Product. \n\nOne of our tasks was to generate API keys for Merchant APIs for 3rd Party Integrations. We used provide a Refresh API endpoint along with it. \n\nI was once going though WSO2 API usage dashboard , I noticed that Refresh APIs usage was way too low. \n\nUpon asking my colleagues , I got to know that they were handing out API keys with default expiry ( Those who are unfamiliar with WSO2 , the default expiry is basically  infinity ) . \n\nI reviewed the handover document that development team provided , I found no mention of setting a custom expiry before creating an API key. The support guys just followed the document by heart.\n\nLuckily this is practiced was stoped after that and no security lapse happened.",

Solving the organizational meed is crucial, and I feel like you covered this here pretty well.\n\nCoupling complexity can be immense with teams fewer than 5. We're an org that has a frontend team that split into stream-aligned teams without changing anything about the monolith app. It's been a nightmare where everyone touches everything and teams frequently impact each other. We currently have 4 teams. If the app were well modularized, the risk would be lower, of course, but it really isn't.\n\nOne question with the MPA approach: as different teams are serving from different URLs, how do you maintain page state and shared components?",

We have some kind of “frame” (it was before the module federation) so every team with their modules could register module, route for the module and position for the module. \n\nSo, module “my-cart” could be registered under path “/cart” and on position “content”. That configuration was provided by backend and frontend was building it. Every module was stored in some CDN so “frame” had to pull files and then load them. \n\nLead engineers decided to leave at most freedom as it’s possible for teams. So it was to possible to have different versions of React in system. And we had. Same with state. Every module had separate state. So if some module fetched data for user, another module didn’t have that kind of data. Except…\n\nThere were “frontend core team”. Something like that. They built the frame, the React UI components that every team should use to build modules and “agnostic libraries”. Agnostic so they weren’t written in React. And they provided methods likes “getUser”. And those methods were cached so if two different modules fetched for user, there was only one request. \n\nOver the time I think it was a brilliant architecture.",

This is similar to the way a scientific theory is a model of reality that allows reliable predictions to be made about outputs based on specified inputs.\n\nThe important point here is to distinguish between the scientific model of reality and reality itself. When physicists discuss a theory of gravitation, they understand at some level that they are making confident statements *about the model*, not about reality itself, and while there may be (and hopefully is) some correspondence between the theory and reality, confidence in the former does not necessarily extend to the latter. We should not confused the map for the territory.\n\nLikewise, software is a model of the business domain. When we define a Person table in the database, it's not an assertion of what it means to be a person out in the real world of the business domain, it's an assertion of what it means to be a \"person\" in this model of that domain, which is only concerned with encapsulating *certain aspects* of the real person useful to the model.\n\nWe may not be able to define exactly what a person, or intelligence, or a soul is out in the real world, but we absolutely can nail down the aspects of that entity we want to capture in the model and how those aspects are to be represented, and it's perfectly okay to make confident statements about the entities in the model. It should go without saying that those statements do not necessarily apply to the whole thing being modeled.",

Or figure out cohorts of talent based on job titles and companies worked and compare skills. All the stuff it would be good if LinkedIn actually did.",

The other requirements can all be solved with well-established techniques and aren't far from baseline CRUD features with some amount of scale. Finding the best candidates is much more likely to be where the competitive advantage and innovation needs to be.\n\nI'm sure you can use manual synonym dictionaries to know the JDK and Java are related (and Javascript isn't). That might not work with, say, knowing that crop classification and modelling using Sentinel 1 data is related to synthetic aperture radar, geotiff files, xarray, Earth observation, the space industry and scientific computing.\n\nIt's a whole design can of worms to open, though, compared to the rest.",
