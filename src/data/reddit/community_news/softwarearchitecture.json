      "text": "We ran into something recently that made me rethink a system design decision while working on an event-driven architecture. We have multiple Kafka topics and worker services chained together, a kind of mini workflow.\n\n[Mini Workflow](https://preview.redd.it/fgm3nejx93hg1.png?width=3750&format=png&auto=webp&s=7965432a4731f2658c648475b1d90593a0f69282)\n\nThe entry point is a legacy system. It reads data from an integration database, builds a JSON file, and publishes the entire file directly into the first Kafka topic.\n\n# The problem\n\nOne day, some of those JSON files started exceeding Kafka’s default message size limit. Our first reaction was to ask the DevOps team to increase the Kafka size limit. It worked, but it felt similar to increasing a database connection pool size.\n\nThen one of the JSON files kept growing. At that point, the DevOps team pushed back on increasing the Kafka size limit any further, so the team decided to implement chunking logic inside the legacy system itself, splitting the file before sending it into Kafka.\n\nThat worked too, but now we had custom batching/chunking logic affecting the stability of an existing working system.\n\n# The solution\n\nWhile looking into system design patterns, I came across the Claim-Check pattern.\n\n[Claim-Check Pattern](https://preview.redd.it/3lmiy1t9a3hg1.png?width=3332&format=png&auto=webp&s=890aa3c5d542d979c9e7eb0d564dcfa576aa9276)\n\nInstead of batching inside the legacy system, the idea is to store the large payload in external storage, send only a small message with a reference, and let consumers fetch the payload only when they actually need it.\n\n# The realization\n\nWhat surprised me was realizing that simply looking into existing system design patterns could have saved us a lot of time building all of this.\n\nIt’s a good reminder to pause and check those patterns when making system design decisions, instead of immediately implementing the first idea that comes to mind.",

All those other information you should get on your own from database or other storage when you think it's necessary.\n\nIn real time system you usually want to have each message under ~1.4kb this is the frame size in which your messages are send over the network.\n\nBecause if you need to pass larger messages you will need wait for the all other frames that together create single message.\n\nThis way if you send only 1 frame you can go crazy fast.\n\nAlso Kafka uses stores messages to be replied when necessary, you will be able to store more messages.\n\nYou also may want to think about private replies of messages. For example you have service that receives http request, you send event and await other in response. You need to know how to send a response event to the instance of app that holds http socket file to be able to respond to the http request with the event data.\n\nIt's a bit more advanced but it is what many event driven systems need.",

The same applies to telemetry data in fleet management.\n\nClaim Check has its merits, as you mentioned, but it also has downsides.

This has been around for a long time and continues to get better. Fully generating your posts will result in removal, repeat offenders will be banned. I'm open to pinning a post that has a list of good alternatives if we can crowdsource it from experience.\n\nThank you to everyone who voted in the poll! Keeping the sub healthy takes everyone's effort. Thank you especially for those that called for mod action, they spurred this new rule into existence.",

Instead, there are many hard parts--difficult problems or issues with no best practices--that force you to choose among various compromises. With this book, you'll learn how to think critically about the trade-offs involved with distributed architectures. Architecture veterans and practicing consultants Neal Ford, Mark Richards, Pramod Sadalage, and Zhamak Dehghani discuss strategies for choosing an appropriate architecture.\n>\n>By interweaving a story about a fictional group of technology professionals--the Sysops Squad--they examine everything from how to determine service granularity, manage workflows and orchestration, manage and decouple contracts, and manage distributed transactions to how to optimize operational characteristics, such as scalability, elasticity, and performance. By focusing on commonly asked questions, this book provides techniques to help you discover and weigh the trade-offs as you confront the issues you face as an architect. Analyze trade-offs and effectively document your decisions Make better decisions regarding service granularity Understand the complexities of breaking apart monolithic applications Manage and decouple contracts between services Handle data in a highly distributed architecture Learn patterns to manage workflow and transactions when breaking apart applications\n\n\n*I'm a bot, built by your friendly reddit developers at* /r/ProgrammingPals. *Reply to any comment with /u/BookFinderBot - I'll reply with book information.

Martin (“Uncle Bob”) By applying universal rules of software architecture, you can dramatically improve developer productivity throughout the life of any software system. Now, building upon the success of his best-selling books Clean Code and The Clean Coder, legendary software craftsman Robert C. Martin (“Uncle Bob”) reveals those rules and helps you apply them. Martin’s Clean Architecture doesn’t merely present options. Drawing on over a half-century of experience in software environments of every imaginable type, Martin tells you what choices to make and why they are critical to your success.\n>\n>As you’ve come to expect from Uncle Bob, this book is packed with direct, no-nonsense solutions for the real challenges you’ll face–the ones that will make or break your projects. Learn what software architects need to achieve–and core disciplines and practices for achieving it Master essential software design principles for addressing function, component separation, and data management See how programming paradigms impose discipline by restricting what developers can do Understand what’s critically important and what’s merely a “detail” Implement optimal, high-level structures for web, database, thick-client, console, and embedded applications Define appropriate boundaries and layers, and organize components and services See why designs and architectures go wrong, and how to prevent (or fix) these failures Clean Architecture is essential reading for every current or aspiring software architect, systems analyst, system designer, and software manager–and for every programmer who must execute someone else’s designs.

Not only we have to chase ever-changing technological trends, but we also have to grasp business domains that we are building the software for. The latter is often overseen, and it explains why so many projects are doomed to fail. After all, how can you build a solution if you don't understand the problem?\n>\n>Through this book, you will learn the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) methodology which provides a set of core patterns, principles, and practices for analyzing business domains, understanding business strategy, and, most importantly, aligning software design with its business needs. These include Ubiquitous Language, Bounded Contexts, Event Storming, and others. You will see how these practices not only lead to robust implementation of business logic, but also to future-proof software design and architecture. You will also learn the relationship between DDD and other methodologies to ensure that you are able to make architectural decisions that will meet the business needs.\n>\n>The final section puts all of this into practice using a real life story of implementing Domain-Driven Design in a startup company. Reading the book will allow you to use DDD for analyzing business domains, aligning software and business strategies, and making socio-technical design decisions. By the end of this book, you will be able to:-Build a shared understanding of a business domain-Analyze a company's business domain and competitive strategy-Decompose a system into bounded contexts-Coordinate the work of multiple teams working together-Gradually start implementing domain-driven design\n\n\n*I'm a bot, built by your friendly reddit developers at* /r/ProgrammingPals. *Reply to any comment with /u/BookFinderBot - I'll reply with book information.

It avoids the one-size-fits all process tarp pit with advice on how to tune your design effort based on the risks you face. This book seeks to make architecture relevant to all software developers. Developers need to understand how to use constraints as guiderails that ensure desired outcomes.\n>\n>This book focuses on the technical parts of software development and what developers do to ensure the system works-not the job titles or processes. It shows you how to build models and analyze architectures so that you can make principled design tradeoffs. It describes the techniques software designers use to reason about medium to large sized problems and points out where you learn specialized techniques in more detail. The approach in this book embraces drill-down/pop-up behavior by describing models that have various levels of abstraction, from architecture to data structure design.\n\n\n**Fundamentals of Software Architecture An Engineering Approach** by Mark Richards, Neal Ford\n\n\n>Salary surveys worldwide regularly place software architect in the top 10 best jobs, yet no real guide exists to help developers become architects. Until now. This book provides the first comprehensive overview of software architecture’s many aspects. Aspiring and existing architects alike will examine architectural characteristics, architectural patterns, component determination, diagramming and presenting architecture, evolutionary architecture, and many other topics.\n>\n>Mark Richards and Neal Ford—hands-on practitioners who have taught software architecture classes professionally for years—focus on architecture principles that apply across all technology stacks. You’ll explore software architecture in a modern light, taking into account all the innovations of the past decade. This book examines: Architecture patterns: The technical basis for many architectural decisions Components: Identification, coupling, cohesion, partitioning, and granularity Soft skills: Effective team management, meetings, negotiation, presentations, and more Modernity: Engineering practices and operational approaches that have changed radically in the past few years Architecture as an engineering discipline: Repeatable results, metrics, and concrete valuations that add rigor to software architecture\n\n\n**Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture** by Martin Fowler\n\n\n>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture By Martin Fowler\n\n\n**Enterprise Integration Patterns Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions** by Gregor Hohpe, Bobby Woolf\n\n\n>Enterprise Integration Patterns provides an invaluable catalog of sixty-five patterns, with real-world solutions that demonstrate the formidable of messaging and help you to design effective messaging solutions for your enterprise. The authors also include examples covering a variety of different integration technologies, such as JMS, MSMQ, TIBCO ActiveEnterprise, Microsoft BizTalk, SOAP, and XSL. A case study describing a bond trading system illustrates the patterns in practice, and the book offers a look at emerging standards, as well as insights into what the future of enterprise integration might hold. This book provides a consistent vocabulary and visual notation framework to describe large-scale integration solutions across many technologies.\n>\n>It also explores in detail the advantages and limitations of asynchronous messaging architectures. The authors present practical advice on designing code that connects an application to a messaging system, and provide extensive information to help you determine when to send a message, how to route it to the proper destination, and how to monitor the health of a messaging system. If you want to know how to manage, monitor, and maintain a messaging system once it is in use, get this book.\n\n\n**Distributed Computing Fundamentals, Simulations, and Advanced Topics** by Hagit Attiya, Jennifer Welch\n\n\n>* Comprehensive introduction to the fundamental results in the mathematical foundations of distributed computing * Accompanied by supporting material, such as lecture notes and solutions for selected exercises * Each chapter ends with bibliographical notes and a set of exercises * Covers the fundamental models, issues and techniques, and features some of the more advanced topics\n\n\n*I'm a bot, built by your friendly reddit developers at* /r/ProgrammingPals. *Reply to any comment with /u/BookFinderBot - I'll reply with book information.

The CLI test is just the simplest way to prove your logic is decoupled from the presentation layer.\n\nIn my view, the Model represents the **\"Business Rules\"** that should exist regardless of whether the app is Web, Mobile, or CLI.

If you are specifically querying for data in column subsets, you could just have dedicated tables for those.\n\nIt’s likely both would be helpful, and both reduce storage space. Be careful of your primary keys and indices but this is enormously effective when done right. \n\nIt isn’t too difficult to roll your own postgres orchestrator across multiple nodes. \n\nAll that said, anytime you go distributed, you have to consider HA and fault tolerance. If you are querying a subset of rows on a node that goes down you obviously won’t be getting the data unless you replicate it.\n\nIf you know your access patterns, the critical and/or most frequently accessed data can use a higher replication factor and if a node goes down just route to the replicas.

Do this a few times and some patterns and best practices should emerge that you can use proactively.

You could make a github action, though, to bundle and export your diagrams to pdf or use your doc repo (I'm thinking Confluence) API to update pages. I know draw io can take in mermaid docs as import, so you may need to get creative on how the rubber meets the road on that one.\n\nI use dendron for all my notes. Dead repo now, but still useful in current form. Use schemas to organize your thoughts, and use the lookup to find what you were working on faster.\n\nI'm a text based guy at heart - I figure if I can describe what I know, well, in words, pictures can augment the information.\n\nI say all this, typing on my phone, with highly questionable grammar haha",

But the main feature is the ability to keep a history of architecture evolution and observe different trends throughout the time. For example, you can get charts catching a change of the dependency number or coupling in your system and understand when and why the drift occurred.

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI could really use some perspective from more experienced people here.\n\nI’m a professional with \\~5 years of experience in tech, the last 3 working as a Data/Systems Integration Specialist at a SaaS company.\n\nMy job on this company is basically to onboard new customers by integrating their data, from ERPs, databases, APIs, and third-party systems, into our platform.  Basically a post-sale software delivery developer job. This involves reading API docs, handling authentication, data mapping, validation, troubleshooting failed requests, supporting integrations running in production, etc.\n\nSo I work with REST APIs, Postman, SQL, JSON/XML, webhooks, error handling, etc. on a daily basis.\n\nThe problem is: lately I’ve startied to feel heavily pigeonholed as “the integration guy”.\n\nI don’t build applications from scratch.  \nI don’t build systems end-to-end.  \nI don’t design architectures.  \nI don’t write large codebases.\n\nAnd when I look at the market, especially internationally (I'm from Brazil), I see two very different paths:\n\n* SWE / Backend / Fullstack → clear growth ladder\n* Integration / Implementation → often seen as operational, repetitive, and not “real engineering”\n\nBut at the same time, I’ve seen many roles like Solutions Engineer that look very aligned with what I do, but at a much deeper technical/architectural level.\n\nI realized my issue might not be the career itself, but the level at which I’m operating.\n\nIt feels like I entered the right field through the wrong door.\n\nInstead of evolving into someone who understands systems, architecture, APIs deeply and can design integrations, I just became good at executing systems integrations.\n\nIt took a couple of years, but now I’m trying to correct that.\n\nI think my current goal is not to switch to full backend/SWE roles and \"restart\" my career. I want to evolve into a stronger Integration / Solutions / Systems Engineer, the kind that is valued in the market.\n\nSo, for those of you who have seen or worked with this type of role:\n\n* What should I study to move from “integration executor” to “solutions engineer”?\n* What technical gaps usually separate these profiles?\n* What kind of projects or knowledge would reposition me correctly?\n* Is this a viable path, or is it truly a career dead-end?\n\nI’d really appreciate guidance from people who’ve seen this from the inside.\n\nThanks a lot.",

My job is basically to design and build a simple pipeline that extracts the customer’s data and transforms it into that required format so our platform can consume it.\n\nSo most of my work is about:\n\n- Reading and understanding ERP/API documentation.\n\n- Figuring out where each required data point lives in the customer system.\n\n- Handling authentication, endpoints, formats.\n\n- Building data pipelines that extract, transform and load the data.\n\n- Aligning business rules with the client for each data type.\n\n-Troubleshooting production issues and handling integration tickets.\n\nI don’t work on the core product design. I don’t design APIs. I don’t build systems end-to-end.\n\nI work almost exclusively on the ingestion side, moving and shaping data so it fits into an existing system.\n\nWhat I’m looking for next is the opportunity to work on a wider variety of problems, architectures and platforms instead of repeatedly solving the same integration pattern around a single product.\n\nToday, my work is constrained by the fact that every solution must ultimately fit into one predefined system. \n\nThat means most of my effort goes into adapting external systems to match our platform’s requirements.\n\nWhat I want is to design integrations and solutions end-to-end, with more flexibility to evaluate the customer’s scenario and define the best technical approach for that context.\n\nInstead of always asking “how do I make this system fit ours?”, I want to be able to ask “what is the best way to connect these systems together?”\n\nI’m very motivated by the challenge of working with different architectures, different stacks, and different integration strategies depending on the problem, APIs, databases, data pipelines, middleware, cloud services, or whatever makes the most sense technically.\n\nRight now, I specialize in making one platform work with many different customer environments.\n\nI want to evolve into a role where I use that same experience to design solutions across many platforms and scenarios.\n\nThat’s where I see the growth potential.",

It took a while but along the way I was always able to ask for a higher salary (because I always had relevant experience) and I got to see different aspects of engineering.   \n  \nI actually found that while design work is rewarding in its own way, the role has a different vibe from customer facing roles. I personally find that in customer facing roles I get to solve technically challenging issues but don't have to deal with as much office politics. Often I find more of a teamwork mindset among coworkers (even the Sales guys) when in a Support role. Obviously it depends on the company but I've seen similar dynamics at my past 2 employers. \n\nNow my job has a mix of design work and customer support which I'm pretty pleased with.

We’ve just released a book that’s written for people who have to make architectural calls around event-driven systems and then defend those decisions over time. Mods said it's ok if I post it here:\n\n**Kafka for Architects** by Katya Gorshkova  \n[https://www.manning.com/books/designing-kafka-systems](https://hubs.la/Q041FhV20)\n\n[Kafka for Architects](https://preview.redd.it/guav3ysxachg1.jpg?width=2213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc59d0f2fef718c70d40b4996d59b6f879992605)\n\nThis isn’t a Kafka API guide or a step-by-step tutorial. It stays at the architecture level and focuses on how Kafka fits into larger systems, especially in organizations where multiple teams depend on the same infrastructure.\n\nA few of the topics the book spends real time on:\n\n* Kafka’s role in enterprise software and where it fits in an overall system design\n* Event-driven architecture as a pattern, including when it helps and when it complicates things\n* Designing data contracts and handling schema evolution across teams\n* Kafka clusters as part of the system’s operational and organizational design\n* Using Kafka for logging, telemetry, data pipelines, and microservices communication\n* Patterns and anti-patterns that tend to appear once Kafka becomes shared infrastructure\n\nWhat I appreciate about this book is that it treats Kafka as an architectural choice, not just a technology. Katya walks through trade-offs you’ll recognize if you’ve ever had to balance team autonomy, data ownership, and long-term maintainability. The examples are grounded in real-world systems, not idealized diagrams.\n\nIf you’re responsible for questions like “Is Kafka the right fit here?”, “How do we keep event contracts stable?”, or “What happens when this system grows to ten teams instead of two?”, this book is written with those concerns in mind.\n\n**For the** r/softwarearchitecture **community:**  \nYou can get **50% off** with the code **PBGORSHKOVA50RE**.\n\nIf you’re already using Kafka as part of a larger system, I’d be interested to hear what architectural challenges you’re currently dealing with.\n\nThanks for having us. It feels great to be here.\n\nCheers,\n\nStjepan",

          "text": "Just a comment from someone who dislikes it. I hope we're talking about the same thing, though, because I'm not really sure...\n\nI don't think that's the real reason. One thing might be horizontal dev scaling: plenty of businesses barely build upon anything, it's an endless crunch to appease one customer, then the next and so on. Architecture is simply an attempt to install guardrails so they can hire en masse with low costs and divide up work. Something a very average dev (mediocre even) can handle, because you want lots of them. Another thing is the expectation that software is write-once, especially when they accumulate tons of half-baked features and tech debt that's difficult to repay, they try to extract as much as possible (and impossible).\n\nIn a nutshell, it's trying to scale up work as cheaply as possible, because ultimately a lot of business is just trying to get money to work. As for where and whether it goes wrong objectively, this is also debatable. I would say the main issues are (1) unrealistic expectations and (2) they're missing out on higher impact, more efficient software development that really taps into the potential of this domain (but you need a strong vision for this, it's not just a matter of spending).\n\nIn practical terms, you'll see silos, you'll see layers upon layers that give the impression that everything is decoupled (yet it isn't, the spaghetti is on another level), you'll see work getting split in ways that makes absolutely no sense and results in huge amounts of duplication. Do reduced hiring costs make up for this? Maybe, although I doubt it can beat a small team of people with enough expertise cutting through the bullshit and working under a well-determined, restricted scope. Scope creep and tech debt tends to balloon up costs, so even if it looks like you can satisfy hundreds of customers early on, things eventually slow down greatly and you have to keep adding to the headcount and reducing margins. Until the costs become insane and the project gets sunset (often quite early).",

We have a lot of instances where we would benefit from event driven systems and concepts, but we remain strictly RESTful because we don't have the knowledge to support it. When making designs in such cases, it's important to be mindful that at some point this would change, because the other way around increases cost i.e on operations. Hence the designs go into series of discussions which tradeoff to choose, and enterprise architecture essentially helps making these decisions as it allows to estimate the cost for the current project and the cost of changing it in the future. Comparing this to projections of other cost like cost of running operations or other non functionals help making smart business decisions.\n\nAs cost of change needs to be minimized and eventually management will come to their senses, enterprise architecture is sadly required for technical people to cope with ever changing nature of business demands.",

If Elasticsearch indices are managed outside the application, how should the app safely depend on them without crashing if an index is missing or renamed? For example, is it okay to just return an empty list when Elasticsearch responds with an error?\n\nQ3. Without migrations like SQL, how are index mapping changes managed over time?  \n\n\nQ4.

They have pre-written frameworks/utilities for most of the things. \n\nBasically, we hardly get to design any such thing ourselves hence I lack much experience of it and my post might seem naive so please excuse me for it.\n\n(EDITED) The requirement was that we will be using RabbitMQ so the user request to service A will send a message to the queue and there will be a consumer service B which would use Apache Camel, would go through routes (I mean so it's already asynchronous) to finally requesting records from the join of tables. (Just a simple inner join, nothing complex) Those records might or might not need processing and have to be written to a multipart file of type csv, which would be sent to another API to another service C.\n\nWe're using PostgreSQL. I've figured out the Camel routing part (again using existing utilities). Designed a sort of LLD. Now the real question was fetching records and writing to csv without running into OOM issue. It seems to be the main focus of my technical architect.\n\nI've decided on using - (EDITED)\n\nJdbcTemplate.query using RowCallBackHandler\n\n(Might use JdbcTemplate.queryForStream(...), since I'm on Java 17 so better to use streams rather than RowCallBackHandler, but there are other factors like connection stays open, fetchSize on individual statement isn't possible)\n\nWould be using a setFetchSize(500) - Might change the value depending on the tradeoffs as per further discussions.\n\nMight use setMaxRows as well.\n\nThe query would be time period based so can add that time duration in the query itself.\n\nThen I'll be using CSVWriter/ByteArrayOutputStream to write it to the Multipart file (which is in memory not on disk). [Not so clear on this, still figuring out]\n\nI know it's nothing complex but I want to do it right. I used to work on a C# project (shit project) for 4.5 yrs and moved to Java, 2 yrs back.

Help me to understand:\n\n-Why rabbit?it means that the  process that read the file (call it the producer) is not on the same software/machine/system of the one that read them? ( Call it the consumer). So producer read from your db, write messages in rabbit and a different system will read and build the csv?\n\n- camel is not enough to be \"automatically async\" because of routes. A route can be fully sync, and to be honest in most case you want to be sync ( for example if you are dealing with transactions). The async is because of Rabbit,and it's async between producer and consumer still the consumer part might or might not be sync with the thread that read from rabbit.\n\n- if messages goes from postgeres to the CVS producer via rabbit,the advance of using streamed query highly depends on how you write on rabbit.do you send rows in bulk ( 10,100,1000s each rabbit message) or one message each row ( very poor performance wise)?\n\n- by the way if performance is a concerns,don't use text formats for rabbit messages (Jason,XML ) goes for a binary serialization library.\n\n- what is a multiparty csv? There are csv payload and multipart http requests. Multipart csv look new to me.\n\nClarify these please and we can continue...\n\nEdit: and most important how \"big\" is big here? Thousands of records?millions? billions? A 10MB csv, 100 MB? GB?",

I just mentioned RabbitMQ and Camel to tell that DB call would happen on a separate thread so it's already non-blocking in one way.\n\nSo the DB call and CSV formation both are part of the RabbitMQ consumer service.\n\nIt will be sending the Multipart File which will be of type CSV. \n\nHow the 3rd service will send/display that file to the user is completely out of my control.\n\nNumber of records currently atmost are 100k, but will increase with time. The table is already monthly partitioned and indexed.\n\nAlso, I know it might not take that much memory right now but my team's main concern is that we should still not bring and store everything in memory.\n\nEdit: To summarize I want to know how can I use JdbcTemplate in a better way as per this usecase.",

If you want to keep a minimum of streaming features you probably want to use chunked data (if http 1) or DATA frames (if http/2) but you need to be sure that both your http client and API server are able to manage them (which should be..but check to be sure).\n\nIf not, you have to send the CVS file all in once,that means load in memory all at once. Or you might want to save it on some third party storage and send link to the external API to retrieve if it too big.\n\nConsidering you can actually send data in streaming fashion, I think I would go for paginate the query on db assign each page to a different thread, read and process In parallel (you may want to track some row key or page number to reorder data at the end),and then compose and reorder it need. With camel should be matter of a couple of stages to accomplish that, patterns of scatter and recompose is well supported.\n\nThen you can buffer your rows,once processed and reordered and send them when ready again in chunk,or data as said before.\n\nBut keep in mind,if you need  any summarized data (like the average of some value,thing like that )you cannot avoid to load  everything in memory at least once.\n\nI would keep thing parametric like:\n\n- records in a page \n- number of thread for reading\n -dimension of chunk\n- dimension of http post body buffer\n\nAnd play a bit to see what fit best. Speed and Memory and resources are always connected,high speed, more parallelism,more memory and more resources but faster.\n\nLess parellism,or smaller db pages,will consume less resources but requires more time to complete..you need to try and tweak.\n\nIdeally if you want to stream directly from db to API,you cannot use more that one thread for db page (no parallelism, one page at time, out of db through API sync)\n\nThe more parallel thread you will use the more memory you need because worst case, to build an ordered chunk you might need to keep in Memory all the required pages until you fill the write buffer. I.e. you spin 3 thread and read page 1,2,3 but thread 3 finish first. To send all the records ordered you need to wait for thread 1 an 2 to complete, so worst case you need all 3 Db pages to be loaded in memory for reordering.\n\nso keep main parameters variables using external properties ( possibly with hot reload or JMX access to change them while running) and find your sweet spot.",
