      "text": "Hi All,  \n  \nI've been a software architect for last 12 years, 24 years yoe overall. I have worked on large enterprises as well as early stage startups.\n\nHere are patterns I keep seeing repeatedly where projects are messed particularly in startups, which I wanted to share:\n\n**Premature microservices**. Your team is 4 engineers and you have 8 services and thinking to build 4 more. You don’t have a scaling problem. You have a coordination problem. A well-structured monolith would let you move 3x faster right now. I would suggest go for modular monolith always.\n\n**No clear data ownership**. Three services write to the same database table. Nobody knows which one is the source of truth. This becomes a nightmare at scale and during incidents. Again go for modular monolith, and if you want strictly then CQRS is way to go (but still overkill if you don't have that much scale)\n\n**Ignoring operational complexity.** The architecture diagram looks awesome . But nobody thought about deployment, observability, or what happens at 3 AM when the message queue backs up.\n\n**Over-engineering for hypothetical scale**. You have 5000 users, but only 500 MAUs. You don’t need Kubernetes, a service mesh, and event sourcing. Build for the next 10x, not the next 1000x.\n\nMost of these are fixable without a rewrite. Usually it’s a few targeted changes that unlock the next stage of growth.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone is dealing with similar challenges.",

But I would suggest against it in most cases because sql database can handle high amounts of inserts concurrently. So it just adds complexity, while proper database design would have got you there without it.\n\nThere are various things to consider though.\n\n* Make sure the indexing is designed in a way that you are not randomly inserting into pages to avoid expensive page splits. But at the same time avoid insert hotspots by inserting everything at the same page. There is very well written documentation on this from the SQL Server teams.\n* Make sure no page locks are taking place on the pages you are inserting to. So use correct isolation levels in queries.\n* Keep the amount of indexes on tables small as possible. Keeping indexes up to date is expensive.\n\nFor large batch operations it's usually better to go for another approach like using Bulk Copy Program (BCP). It's designed for doing millions of inserts in tables.",

No.\n\n>  additional infrastructure headache: separate read databases, event buses/message queues, projections, more things to deploy, monitor and debug.\n\nThis is just patently wrong. \n\nEverything you've said about CQRS is wrong except for two different read and write paths. Literally all that is required for CQRS is instead of having an OrderService that both queries and saves information, you split it into an OrderReadService and OrderWriteService.\n\nCQRS says absolutely nothing about data storage.

Even when it comes to writing code, AI agent are far from having \"solved\" it.\n\n_A Philosophy of Software Design_ by John Ousterhout makes the distinction between tactical coding and strategic coding. AI agents are tactical tornados; they will get the job done, but they don't care about technical debt or the maintainability of their answers. They write, write, write, until they are confronted by their own mess, and then fail to write any more coherent code.\n\nUnless your codebase has solid foundations and you spend a lot of time improving these foundations, using strategic code, your codebase will become a mess.\n\nHow much time should you spend on human-made strategic code vs. agent-made tactical code? I don't know. John Ousterhout proposed 20% strategic / 80% tactical, but he wrote his book before AI agents were a thing.\n\nThis barely scratches the surface. As a developer, coding is just one part of my job. I spend the majority of my time communicating with stakeholders, designing solutions, managing projects, etc. AI agents can help me brainstorm and put my thoughts into words, but I doubt an AI agent would be able to replace me.",

A well-structured monolith can scale surprisingly far and is much easier to maintain early on. Microservices make sense later.

You can always extract services later when you actually know where the boundaries are.\n\nThe one thing I would add: when that extraction eventually happens, the number one source of pain is API contracts between the new services. Inside a monolith you have compile time safety. The moment you split something into a separate service communicating over HTTP, a field rename or a type change becomes invisible until something breaks at runtime.\n\nSo if you start with a monolith, structure it with clear module boundaries and explicit interfaces between domains. That way when the time comes to extract a service, you already know what the contract looks like. Teams that skip this step end up with a distributed monolith that has all the downsides of microservices and none of the benefits.\n\nTo answer your question: yes, monolith first every time. But treat your internal module boundaries as if they were API contracts from day one. Future you will be grateful.",

              "text": "I love the spirit and wit of this comment, but having been knee-deep in DCB in the recent months, here are some additional perspectives on the topic from my recent experience, that hopefully may enlighten the reader on what \"unlearning\" and \"learning it again\" may mean.\n\nThe best definition of an aggregate that I came across is that of a \"consistency and concurrency boundary\".  The aggregate is responsible for validating business invariants it encapsulates, and, as a corollary, you can't write concurrently to same aggregate. This can be painful in many natural hierarchical relationships that arise when modeling any domain, the classical DCB example being that of a \"Course\" and a \"Student\". As far as I know, without DCB, the \"correct\" way of handling cross-aggregate constraints is to leverage some form or orchestration with compensation such as a saga, but this feels extremely heavy in systems for which we don't expect significant load.\n\nDCB's idea is that, in order to make any business decision, the decision will be based on a set of relevant events, and the consistency / concurrency boundary is not fixed to a predefined entity (aggregate), but instead based on the stability of the event set used for the decision. For instance, if all you need to enroll a student abc into a course xyz is that the course exists and the student exists, then your event set for consistency purposes is \"(COURSE\\_CREATED OR COURSE\\_CANCELLED) where course\\_id = 'xyz'\" and \"STUDENT\\_CREATED where student\\_id = abc\".\n\nThe \"unlearning\" part is that, for anyone having struggled with aggregate-induced modeling problems, DCB feels magical. No more aggregate, only events. Need a new command ? Ask what events it needs for consistency, project them in the relevant shape, and you're done. Amazing ! But soon, you will have 12 commands and 15 event types, every command will be building its own projection, which is basically a small model of the domain, and everything will be hard to understand. We have traded rigidity for chaos. Whoops.\n\nSo here's the relearning that happened to me: aggregates still make sense in the context of DCB. There is a \"Course\" aggregate, and a \"Student\" aggregate, they have a well-defined projection from the event store, and they handle (almost) all invariants that are related to them. They are also natural entities to create read-models for for UI and integration purposes. DCB is here still, but rather than everything defining its own little custom projection, we define custom projections in a very restricted manner, only for cases where true \"cross-aggregates\" invariants should be enforced, and we expect that loading the full aggregates would lead to concurrency problems.\n\nWhat I've observed in practice is that our commands broadly fall into two categories:  \n\\- Commands that are interested in one single aggregate, and take rich business decisions on that aggregate based on complex state.  \n\\- Commands that are interested in multiple aggregates, but that only need to make \"simple\" decisions, and work off a small set of distinct events (typically existential events such as creation / cancellations)\n\nThe first kind should use full \"aggregates\", even when not strictly necessary. Only the second kind should use custom projections, and even for those, I found that some form of limited \"existential\" projection can be shared across multiple commands (e.g. \"Enroll student is course / remove student from course\").",

Do you have any example of something that went into the \"hard to understand\" territory?\n\nBecause how I see it, even if you have these custom projections that otherwise would be on the aggreagte, they still would only be bound to the one tag of that aggregate. Nothing really changes except the ability to use per-property precision in the folding of events into state. Get all of those custom projections together, and now you have your traditional aggregate again.\n\nThe commands that do span multiple tags still benefit over the traditional way, ofcourse.",

And remember, you will only need to fully load the aggregate root on _write_ operations which will constitute less than 10%(or even 1%). So I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Around 1MB of data is fine. Do a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation of how large your aggregate can grow.

If you try to keep everything in one aggregate, depending on the complexity of the bounded context, you're going to have something akin to a god class that is very hard to understand before you start having memory problems (because that aggregate will have to be the entry point to ALL domain behavior).\n\nThere are ways to model the \"a restaurant can’t have more than 50 branches\" rule without having the branch be an entity in the restaurant aggregate. The restaurant has to own that rule, yes, but it only needs to know how many branches it has, not their names, menus, and employees. So the restaurant only holds a list of branch IDs, and it checks their count on an addBranch method. If it needs to be transaction-safe but you don't want to deal with cross-aggregate transactions, you can use a saga or reservation pattern.\n\nBut everything is a trade-off, and you have to make the trade-off analysis yourself. Multiple aggregates might actually make things less readable and more complex if you have a lot of these cross-aggregate rules.",

Without knowing what you will be persisting, how often etc. it's very hard to understand the proposed architecture.\n\nAnother important question is are you building a real-time 3D game where players need to coexist in the same physics simulation (collisions, gravity etc.), or is this smaller in scope? A real time 3D game, especially one that supports combat has very different requirements (for example for latency and simulation) than a turn based 2D game.\n\n\nOh and lastly, are you using AI to write these docs?

It describes a system with a modular or distributed domain level sandwiched between monolithic application and data layers (hence the name). This topology is found in *Blackboard Architecture*, *Space-Based Architecture*, and *Service-Based Architecture* by Mark Richards. I suspect that many real-world *Sandwiches* go under the radar being dismissed as transitionary architectures between *Layers* and *(Micro-)Services*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nmiapc9lbvlg1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d0eee81766451b2c7ba7cde90e7f2321b2fe248\n\n[*Cell*](https://itnext.io/cell-777e87543e93) (aka *Cluster* or *Domain*) is a pattern for treating a cluster of closely cooperating services as a single system component. The *Cell*'s internals are isolated from its environment by a *Cell Gateway* (for incoming requests), *Adapters* (one for every external service used by the *Cell*) and, in some cases, *Ambassador Plugins* (that allow other services to inject their business logic into the *Cell*), which makes *Cell* to be a kind of *Hexagonal Architecture* with a distributed core.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jjk7yfobvlg1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e36f8db003e3b8e4d400594c7fab186e1fcd391\n\nAs both patterns describe coupled (sub)systems, a *Sandwich* fits well inside a *Cell*.\n\nSadly, for now both articles are on Medium, which is hard to read, and which likes to show a \"please register\" popup (which is discardable but still annoying). The patterns should appear on the Metapatterns website in a couple of weeks (that are needed to integrate them into the pattern language).",

      "text": "Hi, I'm working on an open-source app ecosystem idea and would like some early input. There's a problem in the software world: all software is broadly divided between\n\n* a) local apps that save files on your drive as files (or database records, sometimes), or\n* b) SaaS that only persists your work to a vendor's servers.\n\nSome local apps (particularly mobile ones) look like a), but are actually b) and they nag you for a subscription fee before long.\n\n  \nClearly, having a cloud-based service where you can access your data from anywhere is beneficial for most people. On the other hand, what's not beneficial is having your data held somewhere by a company that you only marginally trust, without a real possibility of leaving.\n\nA compellingly fortunate case is where an app lets you work in the browser or natively on the desktop, but save/load your results to a selection of vendors, so that you're not tied to a particular company. This decoupling of compute/storage is rare but precious - as is the case with [draw.io](http://draw.io), a popular (open-source) diagramming tool, which I'm sure many readers are no strangers to.\n\nEven then, one cannot expect the application developer to support all imaginable vendors from all over the world, so you're left with the usual suspects: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. What if you don't really like anybody on that list? You can, of course, download the file locally and manually upload/sync it to wherever, but it seems like a less convenient and more error-prone flow, overall.\n\nNow, the general concept is this: **decouple storage** from the app itself. Get the cloud storage experience without Big G.\n\nThe candidates for this are as follows: \n\n1. WebDAV - an old protocol that's quite hard to integrate especially with browser apps\n2. Solid project - a semantic web project from Sir Tim Berners-Lee that proposes *exactly this thing* using Storage Pods, but somehow never has taken off.\n3. Automerge (from Kleppmann and friends) - CRDTs.\n4. A new thing.\n\nI'm researching these options. Lately, I've been gravitating towards option 4. WebDAV is easy to eliminate due to a non-feasible browser story, Solid is as good as dead (sad but expected, given how Semantic Web and WebID never caught on), and Automerge is as compelling as ever if it wasn't for the programming model, especially around schema migrations. CRDTs are somehow very familiar and alien at the same time.\n\nOne important piece of the puzzle is semantics. What do apps need to store? Is it **files**, or maybe **database records** in the SQL sense, or is it some abstract **resources** straight out of Roy Fielding's REST thesis? Different technologies seem to be opinionated towards different base assumptions. At this point, I'm reluctant to point to a single \"model\" that could power 100% of apps.\n\nInstead, I tried to focus on what the programmer would normally expect to have as a backend. And it turns out, an SQL database is a good starting point, but it is not the end. The overarching concept is this:\n\n**An application needs attached resources** in the infrastructural sense, some of which might be an SQL database, a filesystem, or perhaps a notification bus.\n\nA \"personal storage pod\" should make available some resources, and an application should consume them. A personal journal, planner, or To-Do list? It probably needs 1 resource: a plain old SQL database is good enough. A photo gallery app? Filesystem. A cookbook? Might be both - index in a database, food photos in the filesystem (or else you're dealing with blobs in the DB).\n\nThese things are obtainable now - anyone can subscribe to AWS S3 or a competitor and create a bucket and then point a piece of software to it. On the other hand, most people are not in IT and they would rather not manage infrastructure on AWS.\n\nThe user story is, coarsely, this:\n\n1. You sign up with a \"storage pod\" provider (or self-host one)\n2. You try using a new app, Web or traditional\n3. Instead of a typical \"Sign up for free!\" screen, you see \"connect to your pod\".\n4. You go to your pod provider and create a new Workspace.\n5. You copy the Workspace's access token (via a helpful Copy button, very UX-ish) and paste it into the new app from point 2.\n\nWhat do you think about this, in general? Cool idea? Totally unworkable?\n\n  \nSome technical minutiae which might or might not be interesting:\n\nFor the first demo, I've chosen SQLite3 as the backing database. I'm now working on a prototype where a back-end server exposes an SQLite over HTTP, authorizes access using a JSON Web Token (that's the thing the user is meant to Copy/Paste), and loads/stores it as needed. This is multi-tenant with independent lifecycles per tenant, though I'm still working on proper security and isolation.\n\nThe important point is, the database is a single file that the user owns and can download at any time. It can use a local directory or an S3 back-end with tiered persistence. At a high-level, it behaves like a \"serverless\" database (very fashionable, I've heard) - you know this because it has a cold start while it fetches the SQLite file from the archive.\n\nI haven't started work on the filesystem API yet. A major pain point is going to be the quota system - it makes sense to limit users' resource consumption in shared scenarios.\n\n(Sorry if this reads like a brain dump - that's because it is! Let me know your thoughts.)",

In a way, it does: IndexedDB exists, and I have some personal apps that use it. The trouble, of course, is that it doesn't sync at all. There's useful wrappers like Dexie.js, but start reading the docs and 10 minutes in you realize that online sync is a paid commercial service.\n\n\nTo quote a classic: developers, developers, developers, developers!",

              "text": "Thanks for an honest response. I'll start from the end since that's easiest:\n\n\nMigrations. Developers have a good intuition around this. User loads the app, the app connects to their database, checks the version. Outdated? Yep, time to run some DDL (in a single transaction). Done. It gets a little tricky in case of concurrent access, so there might be some fencing required, but the principle still holds: the app just works on this single DB as if the user owns all of it (they do!).\n\n\nAre the pods themselves secure? Maybe. As secure as the user's cloud drive, probably, minus the factor that it's not hosted by FAANG.\n\n\nAbout data ownership: the data logically being the app's and not the user's is somehow very timely. This is just from today: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1rd60go/the_gray_box_problem_of_self_hosting/\n\n\nAnd yes, the average user will struggle to make sense of an SQLite file. On the other hand, even if they do not understand the contents, they can still move it to another provider freely or delete it. Ownership.\n\n\nAbout availability, I think that's a fair point. If the pod is down, it's like the user's hard drive was down. No saving or loading anything. On the other hand, a hosted system like this can possibly be made more available and durable than a local one (\"your laptop\"), and the ability to access the data from more than one device can help mitigate hardware failures on the client end. Of course, the network is one additional thing to fail, and there is no recourse.\n\n\nOverall, there's some trade-offs for sure. Does that make it clearer? It's fair if you still wouldn't touch it, I guess.",

It enforces that no two rows can have overlapping ranges for the same key.\n\nI think this is just an example of what `EXCLUDE` can do rather than the specific use case. [This is the postgres documentation on using EXCLUDE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-EXCLUDE)\n\n>`CHECK` constraints: For validating data at the source\n>\n>CHECK constraints allow you to specify that the value in a column must satisfy a Boolean expression. They enforce rules like \"age must be between 0 and 120\" or \"end_date must be after start_date.\"\n\n[This is the postgres documentation on using CHECK](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-CHECK-CONSTRAINTS)\n\nI'm personally wary of pushing my business logic into the database.  I don't want my database responsible for checking constraints - if anything is reaching the database it should be validated in the business logic before reaching the data store.  I've always followed the 'keep my business logic decoupled' rule when I've built out applications.\n\nI'm curious what other people are doing in practice. Do you rely on these database level features for constraining the values that get stored within the database? Or do you maintain this solely in the business logic?",

Everything has to be \"machine-first\"—meaning text-to-diagram code embedded inside Markdown documents.\n\nMy current plan is to standardize on the **C4 Model** using **Mermaid.js** or **Structurizr DSL**, alongside strict **Markdown ADRs** (MADR) and **OpenAPI/AsyncAPI** for contracts. Since LLMs have a lot of training data on C4 and Mermaid, it seems like the safest bet.\n\nBut I’m wondering if we are just shoehorning a human legacy framework into an AI workflow.\n\n**My questions for the community:**\n\n1. Is there a better architectural framework or DSL emerging specifically for human-AI collaboration?\n2. Have you found any schemas (YAML/JSON/Markdown hybrids) that give LLM agents better semantic understanding of data flows and system constraints than Mermaid?\n\nWould love to hear how others are solving this \"human-to-machine\" architecture handoff!",

Model-driven development is the future (maybe), and the entire point of UML was to be able to auto generate code from such a model - but it was way too complex and the automation wasn't there yet. I think with AI agents the automation aspect is now solved to a degree, and I think using much simpler models like C4 is a good compromise that lets both the human and AI align on architecture.\n\nI'm building a tool specifically for this: [https://github.com/aklos/scryer](https://github.com/aklos/scryer) \\- it's definitely early and experimental, but AI agents have no issue converting my models into code as long as I define good contract rules (the always/ask/never paradigm), and letting the AI build a model from code is surprisingly easy with an embedded MCP server.",

      "text": "**TL;DR** \\- Important question from this post - How can I stop thinking like a developer to design a system and start like an architect, and how do I identify priorities clearly ? Can I do something about it ?\n\n=====================================\n\nRecently, I had an interview with a company. The first round itself was Architecture based. Not deep system design, but still. \n\nThe interviewer was asking me some scenario based questions and how I would design it and all. TBH, I loved this round. I didn't care about whether I would clear the interview or not, but I thoroughly enjoyed the process. \n\nHowever, after my analysis, I found three problems with myself in my interview\n\n1) In some questions, I found it difficult to recollect some terms. There was situation in the interview, where I could re-collect one answer , but another one, where I couldn't. And this was my second Architecture interview in my career (I have around 5 years of exp.). **Does it get resolved after some practise, or do I need to do something ?**\n\n2) (THIS IS IMPORTANT) - A question was asked to me. I went into analysis mode as a developer, designing the system. However, the interviewer wanted a high level architecture. And although, I had a thought about the criticality of the application, I was unable to map it to the given scenario. Like, there are two things running simultaneously. Out of the two, I couldn't instantly figure out which one would be a priority, and which one wouldn't, although I was thinking about it in my head. Like, there was no clear picture about it. **How do I ensure that it does not happen, like I can prioritise the application ? Does it come with practise ? If yes, how can I practise ? Suggest some ideas please.**\n\n3) For some answers, I used my previous experience to answer the questions. Like mapping the problem to something that we as a team had solved or implemented and then answering. **Is that normal ?**\n\n**================================================**\n\nP.S - Here is the question for Question 2 and how I answered it - \n\n\"Imagine you are preparing an application where an international match is going on. There are millions of people watching the match. And there is a count at the top of the match, showing how many people are actively watching it. How would you design the system, which shows this millions count to every screen (mobile, TV, computer, etc.) ?\"\n\nSo, first, I started saying out loud, what services to use in Cloud. \"I would use this, I would use that, this would be a problem for this. The data may be stored in this....\"\n\nAnd behind my head (without thinking out loud), I was thinking, \"Oh, how would I refresh the count, if 1-2 people drop or 1-2 people join every second, or few seconds. Will it affect the company, if I am unable to show the exact count at every second, or at every change in the viewership ?\"\n\nThen the interviewer offered me a hint, \"What if we store the count in a cache, and call an API that will display the count ?\"\n\nI said, \"Yes that is a way, but we will have to refresh the cache every 10-15 mins or 5 mins depending on the accuracy requirements \"\n\nInterviewer said - \"Well, everyone will be busy watching the match, right ? So, the count of the active users is not a priority. Even if there is a delay in refreshing the count, it wont bother anyone. And finally, based on the max count, the streaming channel can use the value to post it in media outlets and all , about the viewership.\"\n\nSo, my question is-  How can I stop thinking like a developer to design a system and start like an architect, and how do I identify priorities clearly ? Can I do something about it ?\n\n",

It lives inside the workflow, developers do not context switch, and the Copilot autofix integration is useful. For a while it was enough.\n\nThe problem surfaced when we acquired a smaller company running GitLab and inherited tooling on Azure DevOps. GHAS stops at the GitHub boundary. It has no opinion about anything outside that ecosystem. We also started feeling the DAST gap, GHAS has no dynamic scanning and the SCA depth was thinner than we needed once our dependency surface grew past a certain size.\n\nRunning Checkmarx across a mixed SCM environment is a fundamentally different conversation than asking whether GHAS is enough for a pure GitHub shop.\n\nFor teams that made this move, how disruptive was the transition?",
