      "text": "Originally, Uncle Bob did not teach these principles in the order people know today. His friend Michael Feathers, the author of Working Effectively with Legacy Code, pointed out that if you arrange them in a certain sequence, you get the word SOLID. That sequence is what we ended up learning.\n\n# The problem is the order itself\n\nThe idea should start with **D**. Inverting the dependencies or, the dependency rule. High-level policy must not depend on low-level details.\n\n[The interface inside the business rules layer](https://preview.redd.it/kmkoyik4xujg1.png?width=2323&format=png&auto=webp&s=3042b2a2a91fdb2299eecc50c8b31750c6758245)\n\nHigh-level policy is the business rules, the reason the system exists. Low-level details are the database, message broker, third-party frameworks, and delivery channels like Web APIs or desktop UIs.\n\nOnce D is set correctly, **O** and **L** are consequences. The system becomes open for extension and closed for modification because you can swap a message broker without modifying the core. As such, you can replace a concrete implementation at runtime without changing the code. That’s Liskov substitution.\n\nThese principles emerge when dependencies point in the right direction.\n\n[Code dependencies point against the flow of control](https://preview.redd.it/lpn76srnxujg1.png?width=2542&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e358ce67c427d364e61035b4db3060fb6abf5c4)\n\nThe **I** principle often drives systems toward shallow modules. Instead of one deep abstraction, you get fragmented contracts that push responsibility back to the caller. The shallow modules is taken from A Philosophy of Software Design book.\n\n[Deep modules & shallow modules](https://preview.redd.it/1d0drzbwxujg1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8f69e7e76432049cc77819b6089f8ac057c0858)\n\nWhen interface segregation is applied mechanically, it creates coordination code. Over time, especially in large teams, this leads to brittle designs where complexity is spread everywhere instead of being contained.\n\nThe most ambiguous part is **S**. Most people think it means a class should do one thing. This confusion is reinforced by Clean Code, where the same author says code should do one thing and do it well. What becomes clear when reading Clean Architecture book is that S is not a code-level thing.\n\n[Design by volatility](https://preview.redd.it/3b15znw8yujg1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=266cfd9ac9a4b4bd5a02620ba95574ad6d6391df)\n\nWhen decomposing a system into components, the idea is to look for sources of change. A source of change can be an admin, a retail user, a support agent, or an HR role.\n\n[Components separation](https://preview.redd.it/gq4m3iimyujg1.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c5933e8af112491dfaf94ac56bc7f299f73dedc)\n\nA component should have a single reason to change, which means aligning it with one source of change. This is about deciding what assemblies your system should have so work does not get intermingled across teams.\n\n# The takeaway\n\nThe main idea is the dependency rule, not a trendy word like SOLID. That’s how i see it today. It took me years to get here, and I'm open to change my mind.",

Then ⁠ ϕ (y) should be true for objects ⁠ y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\n\nIt's a requirement for designing a correct type hierarchy. Notably this principle has a different perspective than type theory requirements for subtypes (contravariance of parameters & Co variance of returns), it's getting into the notion of **behavioural subtyping**. This is undecidable in general but the point of the principle is that you, the programmer, have to uphold the behavioural contract when creating a subtype. \n\n\nA general example is a subtype that overrides a method to have an infinite loop randomly. It type checks fine, the behaviour is undecidable statically at compile time, and you the programmer have violated the principle by introducing that behavioural incompatibility with the super type. \n\n\nThis is specifically about subtyping and has nothing to do with dynamically calling an implementation of a trait/typeclass/interface at runtime. That's just dynamic dispatch which is a built-in feature of most languages today",

          "text": "I would say the order only matters when one is more a problem for you and I think the purposes of each are much simpler and mor general than this.\n\n\nWhat I've found each idea has been most useful for:\n\n- Single Responsibility, if a single piece of code is handling logic for many aspects of a system, when you change it you have a higher risk of breaking more aspects of the system so may be better if its broken up, it is also useful as a counterpoint to DRY meaning if code looks the same but it serves different purposes then it may be better to just have the code repeated, an indicator you haven't followed it when it might've been useful is if you start adding if-else logic to a method to make it behave differently for one stream of data than the others that use it, like the opposite of shotgun surgery.\n\n- Open/Closed, this is about designing things to have less of a need to change for existing consumers, so if you want to add more behaviour or more options you don't break how the existing consumers of your work, e.g. instead of an internal switch statement just take anyone who implements a certain interface, like the visitor and strategy patterns, or instead of taking unique arguments that get acted on you might consider taking a list that gets iterated on so the list can be added to. This is especially important for libraries and other forms of public APIs, if you follow this principle well then the API consumers will have much less issues.\n\n- Liskov Substitution - This is just about making sure child classes handle the contract of their parents predictably, a common way this gets broken is that people will override a parent classes method just to throw an exception saying its not allowed on the child, this means that consumers of those classes may be surprised if accept the parent and cater for the parent but someone provides this outlier child, you'll likely end up with more errors in your app.\n\n- Interface Segregation - This is more about not having god interfaces, this happens when interfaces aren't serving a specific enough purpose, a good example is xunit's IAsyncLifetime, because it is the only owner of InitializeAsync, but it also has DisposeAsync there are many instances of people having a DisposeAsync method in their test classes that is just a passthrough, if however there were an IAsyncInitializable interface this problem wouldn't occur (obviously it encourages some people to dispose what they create as many forget this so it does serve some purpose but that's a different debate)\n\n- Dependency Inversion - This is really just about passing in what you use instead of both creating it and using it in the same space, and is especially useful for external dependencies, its primarily to reduce coupling, meaning you can use different dependencies for the same service/utility more easily and you can use a service/utility in more different places if you want, also I find most people use it these days for testing, in that for your test you can just pass in a mock or fake instead of the real thing and your test can potentially be much faster and simpler (though many people use this to make their test more complex, but that goes to my final point below)\n\n\nThe problem I notice more often these days is, people applying these princples just because they were told it's \"best practice\" and you end up with the old enterprise fizzbuzz pattern. I think its more important to try and understand when and where these are beneficial and apply them only where the benefit is clear or it's simpler to apply than not, if applying a princple adds complexity without clear benefit then it might not be a good option.",

          "text": ">you get the word SOLID. That sequence is what we ended up learning.\n\n>The problem is the order itself\n\nI'm a bit confused about the assertion that the order of SOLID is somehow significant. It's just meant to be a mnemonic, it doesn't intend to order the principles in any useful way.\n\nI think the most fundamental of these principles is LSP. I'm sure there are arguments to be had about the relative importance of the SOLID principles, but LSP is the one that the others depend upon getting right. If you don't know how to properly implement the behavioral contract of an interface, then inverting dependencies by introducing interfaces isn't going to get you too far.\n\n>As such, you can replace a concrete implementation at runtime without changing the code. That’s Liskov substitution.\n\nI think you're conflating LSP with a thing that proper use of LSP enables, but it's not the only purpose of LSP.\n\nLSP basically says that the behavioral contract specified by a type must not be violated by a subtype. The canonical example of violating LSP is letting Square extend Rectangle. In math, a \"square is a rectangle,\" but in OOD, a square does not behave the same way a rectangle does:\n\n    @Test\n    void testArea() {\n      Rectangle r = new Rectangle();\n      r.setWidth(3);\n      r.setLength(4);\n      assertThat(r.getArea()).isEqualTo(12);\n    }\n\nIf you try to treat a Square instance polymorphically as type Rectangle, this test will never pass because a square is behaviorally not a rectangle.\n\nBasically, LSP says that whatever behavior that's specified by an interface, the subtype must conform. It can play within a more restricted area allowed by the contract, but it may not stray outside those bounds.\n\n>Once D is set correctly, **O** and **L** are consequences. The system becomes open for extension and closed for modification because you can swap a message broker without modifying the core.\n\nI don't think this really gets at that core of what the Open-Closed Principle is all about. I think folks approach it as a kind of \"practice,\" like when new requirements come in, you should try to figure out a way to extend the existing code rather than modify it, but the principle itself doesn't give much guidance on how to design a system that actually makes this possible. It just leaves it to the architect to consult your crystal ball.\n\nWhat OCP is really saying is this: A design should define the roots of your dependency DAG around the most stable business entities and concepts.\n\nIn other words, if you're writing banking software, then there are certain things about the banking business that were true yesterday, they're true today, and they'll be true fifty years from now. Your system has customers, and those customers have accounts, and those accounts have balances. This means that the bank software should define a customer entity that *only* specifies the core, stable properties of a customer, the same goes for accounts. Can a customer exist that doesn't yet have accounts, does that make sense? Yes. Can an account exist that doesn't belong to any customer? No, that doesn't really make sense. So the system should be able to represent a customer without the concept of an account existing, and the account entity can depend on the customer entity. An intrinsic property of an account is a balance, so this core concept of account can declare balance as a property.\n\nNow let's say someone comes along and wants to add a bunch of user preference columns to the Customer DB table, users can specify dark mode on the bank UI, and they like the date formatted this way, etc, etc. By putting these things that might change into the core Customer entity, you're now allowing everything that depends on that entity to also become aware and form dependencies on all this new stuff that might or might not exist ten versions from now. That's bad. Instead, create a UserPreferences table and put all that stuff there, and let it depend upon the Customer table. Now only things that care about UserPreferences will bother depending on it, and everything else that doesn't care about that info doesn't need to be aware of it. This is an example of OCP, extend by adding, not modifying.\n\nThe exception to OCP is when your design doesn't mirror the actual problem domain correctly. Maybe one of the core aspects of a Customer didn't make it into your design, but should have. In that case, you shouldn't try to extend the current design, you should modify the Customer entity so it reflects reality. It's difficult to understand the problem domain, so this will happen, and a good architect is constantly learning and incorporating what they learn into the system. The architect should understand the problem domain well enough to understand where the joints are, and the system should carve the problem domain at its joints, so to speak.\n\n>The **I** principle often drives systems toward shallow modules. Instead of one deep abstraction, you get fragmented contracts that push responsibility back to the caller. The shallow modules is taken from A Philosophy of Software Design book.\n\nI don't agree with this at all. If you look at Ousterhout's diagram, the \"deep\" module has a smaller, more focused interface than the \"shallow\" module. This is exactly in line with the ISP, which says to separate interfaces into smaller, more focused contracts. What Ousterhout is objecting to is abstractions that specify overly simple contracts, basically the overuse of abstraction.\n\nOne of the problems I have with his book is that it hasn't really crystallized a philosophy. It does do a good job talking about his personal philosophy of software design, but I think many of the principles in there are not defined sharply enough to be applicable and they rely too much on the reader's judgment to be an \"objective\" kind of philosophy, if that makes sense. Also, I think he muddies the waters a bit by setting up some of his principles in opposition to other ways of doing things when I feel like he hasn't really deeply understood the thing he's trying to refute, such as the shallow/deep vs. ISP … these are not really opposed.\n\nThe last one is dependency inversion and I'll discuss that in a [separate comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/softwarearchitecture/comments/1r6aglp/comment/o5uaq37/).",

              "text": "I do think that DIP is one of the most critical principles for a great OO architecture, but I feel like it's often misunderstood.\n\nIn the diagram you present where the Data subsystem depends upon the Business subsystem, that gestures in the right direction but leaves out some critical details.\n\nThe first thing that's often misunderstood about DIP is that people think Martin is talking about the n-tier architecture when he talks about the \"layers\" of the system. He's not. In your diagram, you've depicted a business logic layer and a data access layer, and you're probably imagining a presentation layer above the business logic layer, and the web client above that, right? This is the wrong picture.\n\nIf you read his white paper closely, you'll see that he's dividing up the system not according to these tiers, but rather he's talking about policy layers, mechanism layers, and utility layer. If you conflate these \"layers\" with the n-tier architecture of most web apps, you're getting it wrong. Think about the business logic tier, if you parse a string into a URL. That code uses a string utility. If you authenticate a user in order to service the request, you're using the auth module and that's probably a mechanism or utility, and it's also code in that same tier. Maybe you get a request and use a promise pattern to kick off async processing for different things that need to happen…that code managing that async processing isn't \"policy\" stuff, it's infrastructure you're using.\n\nThe way he's viewing a system for the purpose of presenting DIP is completely orthogonal to the n-tier architecture most people think he's talking about. He's not saying that, though. He's saying that when your business logic layer gets a user request and the first thing it does is authenticate that user, it should not call directly into the auth system you wrote and have all that auth stuff on its classpath. It should call into an interface, and the compilation dependency of this subsystem on auth should end there, at that auth API.\n\nThe other big thing people get wrong about DIP is how the abstractions that enable inversion are packaged. If you consider this subsystem that processes user requests, which needs to authenticate the user before servicing the request, it depends on the Auth interface, right? If that auth interface is packaged with its implementation, then a dependency on the interface is a dependency on the deployment unit (a jar, say) that contains all of that implementation code. This means that entire auth jar needs to build as a compilation dependency of this subsystem anyway.\n\nSo you cannot package the abstraction with the implementation, because in order to build and deploy that abstraction in a form for clients to use, the entire auth subsystem has to be built. So instead you package it with the subsystem that uses it, as you have depicted in your diagram. Problem solved, right?\n\nNope. Now the auth subsystem implements an interface in the deployment jar of this other subsystem, and in order to build the auth subsystem, this client of the auth subsystem needs to be built first.\n\nThe takeaway is that you cannot package the abstractions with the implementations nor with the clients. They must be packaged separately. This way, the build system builds those, packages them up, and makes them available to dependencies, which include *both* clients of the interface as well as implementations of it. This is harder than it seems, because that means all dependencies in that API package need to be included in it, and those cannot depend on anything outside either.\n\nIf you haven't set up a system where you can compile the interface independently, then the client and implementations independent of each other, you've inverted the dependency in a hypothetical sense, but you're not getting any benefit from having created these abstractions. You haven't shortened your classpath, you haven't sped up your compiles, you haven't done much of anything. This is something Ousterhout talks about in his book, explaining that he hasn't yet seen a system that really benefits much from DI. That's true, but it's not because DI is bad, it's because people don't actually invert dependency correctly.",

I had recently worked with a team on a worker service that consume a kafka topic and writes the records to several db tables. The team thinking of segregating the interfaces, created an interface for each entity, and i have done that for long. Having a single database port made things simpler, the port implementation acted as a usb port, you know following the hexagonal architecture pattern.\n\nOn dependency inversion, i think it is the most important one and vote for focusing on the dependency rule instead. Most engineers i talk to, mention dependency injection which is the framework that should be a detail. Your point about having the interface in its own assembly and not having it inside the business rules is well taken sir. \n\nThe order SOLID is the problem since most of education starts with the S, which is very ambiguous.   \nIf we can all invert the dependency properly and isolate the core, we would be in a better place.",

There are boundaries within boundaries, recursively.  Your concept of layers handles only one part of that hierarchy, it assumes a linear stacking, and it's non-recursive.  \n\nCurrently I use Lucid.app for customers.  They have the same problem, but they let me put boundaries on the page in the form of shapes and then let me know stuff inside that boundary.  They also let me group the boundary and its contents and make it manipulable as a unit.  But even Lucid has problems because it doesn't handle multiple levels of boundary properly.\n\nEdit:  \n\nOh, and lines need endpoint symbols like arrow heads to imply inbound/outbound directionality at a minimum.\n\nA description for a shape should be a tooltip that pops up when I hover over the shape in the diagram; at least in 2D view.",

I really like it as a quick prototyping tool, and the 3D view scratches and itch I have to see actual depth in our architecture diagrams across layers.  \n  \nA few suggestions/observations/bug reports in no particular order:  \n1. (Suggestion) I would love to have the ability to upload custom icons for blocks or support icon packs like draw.io has for AWS/Azure/GCP resources.  \n2. (Observation/Suggestion) The alignment and distribute tools work great, but the alignment behavior was a little unexpected for me. Granted, my expectations are coming from draw.io's behavior. When I took a few vertical items and try to align them along their horizontal center, I expected them to align based on the center of the *first* item I selected (this is the default behavior in draw.io). It looks like by default that alignment finds the middle of *all* selected elements. I noticed similar behavior with the left-and right-align, where it chose the left/right-most edge of all the selected blocks as the anchor point for alignment. It doesn't ruin the experience, but as someone who is quite particular about alignment and distribution, thinking about every selected block being relative to *each other* is more difficult than thinking about every selected block being relative to the *first* block selected. Not a problem for quick prototyping, but more important for higher-impact diagrams  \n3. (Suggestion) A light mode would be nice. I often show high-level architecture diagrams to our product team and many of them don't do dark mode UI's. I think the colored-coded borders on the left side of the blocks would show up well in a lighter theme. I did some mediocre inline style editing with my browser devtools to change the workspace background and the background/color of one of the blocks and it looked pretty good.  \n4. (Suggestion) I like the nested layers. I would be interested in seeing \"cross\" layers which could contain blocks across other layers. This would be great for representing-for example-VPC's in AWS which can contain back-end and data resources.\n5. (Bug?) I'm not sure the \"Toggle Interactivity\" button is working. I put it in the \"lock closed\" state, but everything in the diagram could still be interacted with. I may be misunderstanding this feature, too.\n6. (Bug/Suggestion) I colored one of my layers black, and in the 3D view the label and label text were both black. Might want to do a check on the layer color and dynamically use an appropriately contrasting label/text color for accessibility/user error.",

Decouple your services.\n3. **Database as a Queue:** Polling your primary SQL database for \"jobs to do.\"\n   * *Fix:* Redis or SQS.

I might update the article to soften the language around lines of code and complexity, because your comments have me thinking about whether these could be useful signals, maybe not as strong as others, that tech debt exists.

I feel like you have really put into practice what so many organizations are afraid to, which is to mine for and expose tech debt.  The coupled pairs feature is particularly exciting as I considered writing a section on coupling, but couldn't precipitate a good a idea on what that implementation would look like.  The viz you chose for that is perfect, I really appreciate that!\n\nWould you mind if I link to your tool in a section of my blog, of course giving you attribution as an author?  I do a lot of soap-boxing in my article, but I don't have a lot of material recommendations on tools to use that implement my advice.  I think \"charlie\" would be a great call out in my blog.  If so, let me know the best way to link to your project, whether it's the reddit post, the github, the npm package, or something else.\n\nFunnily enough, my name is Charlie lol, so this was a bit of a [Baader–Meinhof phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion) for multiple reasons.",

The data wants to be stored in a place that's cost-efficient for low volume on reads\n\nBesides this, I'd consider AWS S3 with IA or Glacier, depending on how fast you need the data (consider adding this and data size to your question, by the way). If you don't need the data fast it could be alright. You could query with AWS Athena.\n\nIf you need the cold data for analytics, it could be an option to also create snapshots of the calculated data as an aggregate for a period, using the lowest required period. So, for example, if you only need granularity down to a day then you could have that calculation for the day stored and use that for the calculations rather than every single invoice. Think of like caching AWS Athena results.\n\nUltimately, you'll probably end up having to calculate how much each of these will cost you.",

In the future, we will have filters, but at the moment the solution focuses on an API without filtering capabilities.\n\nThe API retrieves data from two tables:  \n1 – the invoice headers table;  \n2 – the invoice header transactions table.\n\nThe API response is a JSON containing the header plus its transactions.\n\nThe query logic is quite simple: a straightforward `SELECT` with a `WHERE` clause filtering by due date and account to retrieve the header. With the header ID found, it then retrieves the transactions associated with that header, which consists of another simple `SELECT`.\n\nWhen an invoice closes (after one month), those header and transaction records become immutable in these tables. The idea, then, is to remove them from PostgreSQL and move them to cold storage, because over time these closed invoice records are queried less and less in the database. Someone would only query an invoice from 2018 if they really wanted to check what they purchased in that specific month/year. Queries will be higher for current invoices and recently closed ones, and will decrease as time goes by.\n\nThe number of requests for a recently closed invoice can reach around 3,500 req/s, and then gradually decrease over time to 3,000, 1,000, 500, 100 req/s.

      "text": "I would like to ask a genuine question about how real-world apps like Telegram can handle big chats (they have 200k users per chat limit). Why am I asking?\n\n\n\n# Components\n\n`MessageApi` \\- for simplicity, stateless replicated API that receives the message for chat\\_id, and distributes it to the end user\n\n`GatewayNode` \\- stateful websocket server that handles user connections\n\n`UserGatewayStorage` \\- stores map {userid => GatwayNodeUrl}, sharded by user\\_id\n\n`ChatStorage` \\- stores {chat\\_id => \\[user1, user2, user3\\]} map, and tells who are the users in a particular chat\n\nI do believe it can handle chats up to 250 participants, but I don't see how it can handle big chats/channels with 10k+ subscribers\n\nTypical approach I saw on the internet\n\n**UserConnection**: we connect user to random GatewayNode, GatewayNode updates the mapping in UserGatewayStorage {userid => CurrentGatwayNodeUrl}\n\n\n\n**Message Delivery**: message arrives to MessageApi, it retrieves participants from ChatStorage, then it retrieves all GatewayNodeUrls from UserGatewayStorage, and fans out the message to these GatewayNodes\n\n\n\n# Problem\n\nLet's say we have 10k chats that have 50k+ subscribers each. Let's say we have 1k GatewayNodes, 1k UserStorage nodes, and 1k ChatStorageNodes.\n\nLet's say we evenly distribute the users between GatewayNodes, same for UserStorage shards (consistent hashing)\n\nNow every message in big chat will require querying ALL GatewayNodes and ALL UserStorage shards, because:\n\n\n\n50k / 1k = 50 users in big chat of 50k participants per UserStorage shard\n\n50k / 1k = 50 users in big chat of 50k participants per GatewayNode instance\n\n\n\nIf we have 10k of such chats, and even 1 message per second in every single chat, it means that we are calling ALL our UserShards 10k times per second, and then ALL our GatewayNodes 10k times per second.\n\nIt is broadcast, as for single message we need to call ALL UserStorage shards to resolve necessary GatewayNodes, then we will send message update to ALL GatewayNodes, because for big chat, we will have all GatewayNodes keeping at least one user who is participant in this big chat.\n\n\n\n# Follow up\n\nSome people add one more layer, called ChatNode. Now we connect GatewayNodes to ChatNode based on the chat (let's say consistent hashing). The message then goes first to ChatNode, and then ChatNode distributes it to all interested GatewayNodes. It is still broadcast. According to math, we are going to have ALL GatewayNodes subscribed to ALL ChatNodes.\n\n\n\nAny ideas how this is solved?",

          "text": "It's kinda hard to design this system in the abstract, because if you can leverage and tie yourself to a specific tool, so many things become easier IMO. Lets say im using MQTT and my favorite broker, VerneMQ, though i suspect all brokers have the same capabilities. And your architecture is complicated and expensive to run as you probably noticed. I think Signal does something like what you dscribe, but their chat rooms are quite small and they emphasize privacy over performance.\n\nNow, If you pretend a chat room is a topic, and chat members are subscribers, you now enter the realm of publisher-subscriber architecture and your problem is reduced to such. We still need to keep some sort of membership somewhere and if we want 200k chat members, we have to do it server side.\n\n1. in the database we store all chats the user is a part of\n2. User opens up app and tries to connect. We authenticate him on this topic once via some callback, maybe even write some Lua to save a network call. He will have an MQTT session for this topic and we dont need him to auth him again. Our VerneMQ is sharded and distributed and supports session migration by itself, though you probably want to add some load balancer with session affinity to avoid migration overhead. VerneMQ is configured with retain, which means it always retains the last published message for a topic.\n3. once authenticated, the user receives the last published message. This can be a full chat message or whatever, but the important aspect is that it has a date or some sort of identifier which tells the user the current message.\n4. the user can ask the server to provide all the messages intended for him in the mailbox on the server and he receives all messages.\n\nBy leveraging some implementation details, we have reduced the problem to the user connecting to a broker, authenticating, receiving a timestamp or some sort of identifier that allows him to query the server (or somebody else if you are a p2p protocol) for the entire chat history he missed and the entire load is on the broker and whatever else you are using as a database. No more gateways, sharded session state where only a specific subset lives on a specific node and so on, we used MQTT as a broker for signalling and people can get their chat history from our central mailbox, which is your favorite scalable database solution. Maybe you can play around with queues here to store that history (i dont think storing it on the MQTT broker is acceptable for latency reasons, but it is an option) or whatever else. \n\nAnd as long as he has the app active, we can just publish messages directly to him via the broker and MQTT shines at that.\n\nnow, there are certain bottlenecks in this design - i replaced that whole distributed state thing with a centralized DB that needs to store messages and will get a shitload of IO, but fundamentally, if you have an async chat app, you absolutely must have some fancy central database to store messages as a mailbox for users and distributed state is painful to handle and buggy as hell. And now the problem is reduced from pubsub to scaling your database IO and that is a well studied field. And note that with 200k members in a chat, its probably a notification channel and not an actual channel where all 200k members write at the same time, so we have a relatively very high latency tolerance here - it fundamentally doesnt matter if you get a notification now, or 5 seconds later, but 5 mins later would suck. \n\nWhat i described is similiar to what whatsapp is doing, and unlike telegram, they have written a few whitepapers about their transport protocol (at one point, maybe even today, they deemed TLS bloatware and did Noise pipes instead !)",

So pretty much upon message creation we will send this message to ALL the queue, problem remains the same: given 10k+ such large chats it means 10k+ updates per second on every queue => it does not scale lineary.\n\n===\n\nIn case you meant queue/topic per chat. Same problem, we might have Billions of chats, which broker will allow cheaply create BILLION of topics/channels?

Run MQTT as our signalling platform. We subscribe to all our topics. This is both our MessageAPI and GatewayNode.\n2. User writes a message to the chatroom\n3. Our MQTT receives the message and forwards it to some sort of other process for handling\n4. we process the message: store it on some sort of ordered queue. Every chat has an ordered append only queue.\n5. We store group memberships somehow. Can we shard chats ? Like, a million users actually may look like a lot, but a 4 core i3 from 2017 can send on vernemq 10k messages per second and we could theoretically send a million messages in 1.5 minutes to a million users with a 4 core i3. If we can shard and identify which server or servers host our 1 million, we send one message there and it calls publish to clients in a loop.\n6. These messages end up in the MQTT cluster. It will figure it out, but a potential bottleneck here is the inner cluster communication. Lastly, do note that MQTT is mostly stateless - you can indeed open millions of topics, they do not cost much as long as they are not used much. \n7. users receive message or delta, can sync with our ordered append only log queue. Another potential bottleneck.\n\nI think this should scale as long as the sharding works and the mqtt server does not choke on intercluster communication. And yes,  MQTT can handle billions of topics, facebook proved it by having every instagram user open 22 topics, so their cluster handles 22 billion topics somehow.\n\nLast point:\n\n>Math: we have 10k chats, every single one of them has 50k participants. We have 1k gateway nodes, 50/1 = 50 users in every gatewaynode interested in single chat (some topic/queue)-> every message published to this topic/queue delivers update to ALL gatewaynodes.\n\nFundamentally, for a user to receive a message, somebody has to find his TCP connection file descriptor and call write on it. Therefore, there is physically no way to avoid having  a message or a notification being sent to ALL connected users. Either they poll the server constantly, or we send. Thus as you note, depending on your granurality of sharding, you will will need to find all those shards and have them emit a notification, there just is no way around this.\n\nThis is realistically less of a worry than you think - you can have quite large shards, i proposed sharding by entire room. And these days you can buy 256 cores 4 TB servers and if you are operating at Telegram scale, you can afford it. And if you can't, well, that 4 core i3 from 2017 will do the job in 2 minutes, which is acceptable for the telegram channels with a million subscribers, since they can only be written to by admins and people wont notice if a notification arrives a minute sooner or later, they just need it delivered in a reasonable amount of time.",

          "text": "You're right that telegram is doing something apparently rather impressive. Live connection between \nN global users * C average per-user connections,\n\nwhere C is in the 10s of thousands. Also, the problem isn't cleanly partionable. And finally, it's a complete non-starter because you'll be blowing up users' phones with push events.\n\nWhen answering a question like this, it's best not to start with   sketching a system topology but asking yourself \"what is the algorithm that produces minimum number of operations necessary to satisfy the users?\". Once you have the algorithm you can move to the next step of distributing it.\n\nThe Product Manager may have said \"I want live instant messaging between all users in massive groups\" but you shouldn't treat that as a rigid technical spec. It's a description of the user experience vision. So you might push back and just say no, but it's much better if you can come back with a proposal satisfying their vision. \n\nFirst step is to look at the user interface. In the case of telegram there are 3 main modes for our purposes. Viewing chatlist, viewing a chat and app backgrounded but open to notifications. Immediately what becomes clear is that a person scrolling their chat list doesn't need to see them all live updating and doesn't need to load all the recent messages. When the phone is in their pocket they don't want constant notifications from big groups at all.\n\nFrom this, what I'd imagine telegram actually does goes something like this:\n\nWhen the app is open users are subscribed to message pushes from their 1:1 chats. Perhaps limited to a shortlist of active chats.\n\nFor group chats, users are subscribed to receive a summary every N minutes or else it's pull based. Perhaps that switches to N seconds when the app is foregrounded. The summary actually need only contain the last message truncated. It could also contain the count of unread messages, but that's a bit of per user computation that might also need optimizing away. We can't rely on a static message count per summary because we can't assume the user received every single summary so can add them up. (We might also ask the PM if an accurate number is necessary beyond a certain count or if \"100+\" is ok)\n\nNow, this has already solved most of the problem. Switching from per-message pushes to periodic removes that explosive C number from the scaling equation. It no longer matters how many participants are in each chat, only the number of chats per user.\n\nStill, we can take it a little further. What other qualities of the product can you take advantage of? Well, even though messages are editable, that's the exception that can be layered on top. It is mostly an *append-only* format. There are lots of big optimizations available with append-only systems.\n\nNot only that, the chat is a shared artifact. There isn't a custom version of it for each chat participant. This together with the append-only property means you can aggregate it into chunks of a few hundred messages. That's a static, highly cacheable asset. When the user enters the chat, no server needs to push N unread messages to them they just need to point them to the latest static chat chunk.\n\nSo, summing up, the server architecture you laid out indeed doesn't solve the whole problem. The full telegram architecture has to have additional layers like this. That's why chat apps never launch with such large scale chat features that actually work. It's definitely a bigger project. In a real project you'll want to go back to PM, tell them it's possible but visually represent the sheer amount of extra complexity it will entail. Explain that yes we can achieve this in the end, but what does the more limited intermediate product look like? Limit to small groups? Group chats don't even pretend to be live? If we can make some compromises, that's the v1 we can ship much quicker.",

Solving the organizational meed is crucial, and I feel like you covered this here pretty well.\n\nCoupling complexity can be immense with teams fewer than 5. We're an org that has a frontend team that split into stream-aligned teams without changing anything about the monolith app. It's been a nightmare where everyone touches everything and teams frequently impact each other. We currently have 4 teams. If the app were well modularized, the risk would be lower, of course, but it really isn't.\n\nOne question with the MPA approach: as different teams are serving from different URLs, how do you maintain page state and shared components?",

We have some kind of “frame” (it was before the module federation) so every team with their modules could register module, route for the module and position for the module. \n\nSo, module “my-cart” could be registered under path “/cart” and on position “content”. That configuration was provided by backend and frontend was building it. Every module was stored in some CDN so “frame” had to pull files and then load them. \n\nLead engineers decided to leave at most freedom as it’s possible for teams. So it was to possible to have different versions of React in system. And we had. Same with state. Every module had separate state. So if some module fetched data for user, another module didn’t have that kind of data. Except…\n\nThere were “frontend core team”. Something like that. They built the frame, the React UI components that every team should use to build modules and “agnostic libraries”. Agnostic so they weren’t written in React. And they provided methods likes “getUser”. And those methods were cached so if two different modules fetched for user, there was only one request. \n\nOver the time I think it was a brilliant architecture.",

This is similar to the way a scientific theory is a model of reality that allows reliable predictions to be made about outputs based on specified inputs.\n\nThe important point here is to distinguish between the scientific model of reality and reality itself. When physicists discuss a theory of gravitation, they understand at some level that they are making confident statements *about the model*, not about reality itself, and while there may be (and hopefully is) some correspondence between the theory and reality, confidence in the former does not necessarily extend to the latter. We should not confused the map for the territory.\n\nLikewise, software is a model of the business domain. When we define a Person table in the database, it's not an assertion of what it means to be a person out in the real world of the business domain, it's an assertion of what it means to be a \"person\" in this model of that domain, which is only concerned with encapsulating *certain aspects* of the real person useful to the model.\n\nWe may not be able to define exactly what a person, or intelligence, or a soul is out in the real world, but we absolutely can nail down the aspects of that entity we want to capture in the model and how those aspects are to be represented, and it's perfectly okay to make confident statements about the entities in the model. It should go without saying that those statements do not necessarily apply to the whole thing being modeled.",

It kept just making the same \"dumb implementation\", when I asked it to expand the current code. \n\nBut once I started asking for feedback and other/better approaches, I got several options and could discuss pros and cons. But I (!) had to take control and keep exploring. It took a few tried before it suggested to apply the design pattern I had in mind, to the problem.\n\nIn this particular case, I knew what I wanted from the ai and could keep on until we arrived at the solution.\n\nIf I did not have the basic understanding of design, I might have stopped exploring too early.\n\nAt another time I had some issues with the current approach, but didn't know what to do about it. I was able to have a fairly informative discussion, and found a new approach, I had not thought of.\n\nBut it does put more responsibility on you, compared to human pair programming.",
