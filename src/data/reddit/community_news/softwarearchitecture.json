          "text": "Disclaimer: the following has been generated with AI, by a prompt I've been working on for over a year, with many biases built-in (over 100 rules and principles). Specifically for your questions I've instructed it specifically to focus on the time dimension of decision making.\n\nHere it goes, as if I worded it, only better (English is not my native language) and properly formatted.\n\n**Architecture is not an engineering standard; it is a derivative function of business intent.**\n\nThe mistake most developers make is trying to validate their designs against \"Best Practices\" or abstract notions of \"Scale.\" A Senior Architect doesn't do that. They validate against the organization's runway.\n\nIf you lack a mentor to review your work, you must simulate this mindset by filtering every decision through the current stage of your company.\n\n### 1. The \"Survival\" Filter (Pre-Product/Market Fit)\nIn this phase, the organization is testing hypotheses. The biggest risk isn't \"system failure\"; it's building the wrong thing efficiently.\n*   **Validation Rule:** Optimize for **Reversibility**.\n*   **The Kafka Decision:** If you ask \"Will Kafka handle the load?\", you are asking the wrong question. The right question is: \"Does the operational tax of running Kafka prevent us from pivoting next month?\"\n*   **Verdict:** Kafka is likely invalid here. It forces structural rigidity. A monolith with a simple Postgres job queue is \"valid\" because it’s easy to delete or change when the business idea fails.\n\n### 2. The \"Sales Promise\" Filter (Growth Phase)\nOnce the business has traction, validation shifts from \"Can we change it?\" to \"Can we honor the contract?\"\n*   **Validation Rule:** Optimize for **The specific promise Sales made.**\n*   **Replica vs. Caching:** Don't choose based on tech blogs. Look at the Service Level Agreement (SLA).\n    *   **Scenario A:** Sales sold a financial reporting tool. The promise is **Accuracy**. Caching is now a liability because stale data breaks the promise. You validate by proving you can scale via Read Replicas (ACID compliance).\n    *   **Scenario B:** Sales sold a social feed. The promise is **Responsiveness**. Stale data is annoying but acceptable. You validate by implementing aggressive Caching (Redis/CDN).\n\n### 3. The \"Fermi\" Filter (The Math Check)\nExperienced engineers rarely guess about load. We use **Fermi Estimation** to prove safety before writing code. This is your strongest tool against \"Imposter Syndrome.\"\n\n**The Calculation:**\nDon't worry about \"Real Production Load\" in the abstract. Calculate it.\n*   **Formula:** `Total Users` × `Daily Active %` × `Requests Per User` ÷ `Seconds in Day`.\n*   **Example:** 100k users. 10% active. 50 clicks each.\n    *   `10,000 users * 50 reqs = 500,000 reqs/day`.\n    *   `500,000 / 86,400 seconds = ~5.7 requests per second`.\n*   **The Validation:** A Raspberry Pi can handle 6 requests per second. You don't need Kubernetes; you need a single VPS. Decision validated.\n\n### 4. The \"Bus Factor\" Filter (Secret Fragility)\nYou asked: *\"Is this architecture fine or secretly fragile?\"*\n\nFragility is rarely about code breaking; it's about **Cognitive Solvency**. The \"cost\" of an architecture is the amount of human memory required to operate it.\n\n*   **The Test:** If you (the architect) are asleep or hit by a bus, can the most junior person on the team fix a critical bug at 3 AM?\n*   **The Trap:** If your \"valid\" architecture requires understanding Event Sourcing, three different message brokers, and a custom sharding layer, it is structurally insolvent for a small team.\n\n**Summary:**\nTo validate early, stop looking for \"correctness.\" Look for alignment.\n*   **Early Stage:** Valid = Reversible.\n*   **Growth Stage:** Valid = Honors the SLA.\n*   **Scale Stage:** Valid = Reduces Cognitive Load per developer.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've seen more startups die from over-engineering \"Google-scale\" solutions for zero users than from their servers melting down. Build for the problem you have right now.",

Do you actively maintain architecture diagrams? If yes, how?\n2. What usually causes them to become outdated?\n3. Have you found any approach that actually scales over time?\n4. Or did you consciously decide that keeping them in sync is not worth it?\n\nI’m asking because I’m experimenting with a more model-driven, text-based way of describing architecture that could be versioned and potentially checked against the codebase — but I’m not convinced this is a real problem for most teams.\n\nWould appreciate honest experiences, including “this is a solved problem” or “we stopped caring”.",

Software Architecture is the stuff that does not change that much over time.\n\nThink of it via the Building analogy. The Architecture Documentation would be the drawings of the facade (which  almost never change), the main blueprint stating where the structural/weight supporting columns/walls are, and guiding principles like windows should be either in the North or the Sourth so the building do not get too hot, or that exit doors to the building must open to the outside. Technical Documentation would be the blueprint with the layout of each floor, including electrical and plumbing.\n\nSo a sequence diagram describing the information flow of a particular Use Case? Not part of the architecture. A sequence diagram showing how any generic interaction between the Web client and the App will work, down to the database and potential cache interactions, without describing any particular implementation? That is part of the architecture.\n\n  \nThat said, in reality most teams just don't care because business don't care and do not want to pay the cost of having good, up-to-date technical documentation. So anything that could automate the generation of said documentation without too much friction will be a welcomed tool.",

If you cannot get your team to care about and value good documentation, then it will fall by the way side.\n\nFundamentally, most people are lazy. If they can justify not doing a task (and get away with that justification) they will simply not do it. The thing with technical debt is that it takes time to pile up. By the time it does, many devs have come and gone and they don't have to deal with the repercussions of it.\n\nAs a technical lead you'll have to actively engage in people engineering/wrangling. You'll have to find ways to make devs take ownership of their bits of the codebase and maintain them. Far easier said than done. And honestly there is no magic bullet that will get you there. \n\nThere are things you can try - SRE(Site Reliability Engineering) has really become a thing over the last few years and it has standard approaches that may help. Google's Well-Architected Framework may also provide some insights.\n\nWhatever path you take, dealing with people is always messy.

Architecture is the stuff that does not change quickly. \n\nI would add that every time a product is released to production, core architecture documents should be reviewed for accuracy and updated. The agile concept of “done-done” applies to the release. \n\nOf course, for some teams, release to production happens very frequently as part of an automated CI/CD tool chain. Those teams will benefit for documents generated from code. Most other teams will not.\n\nSo if you are evaluating whether to build a tool, make sure (1) it can be run in a CI/CD tool chain to auto-update documents, (2) it is easy to debug and regenerate the documents to fix errors, and (3) recognize that it is producing low value documentation (which means you should not expect a large market value for the product).",

Overcoming the inertia and getting the organization is probably harder than doing the actual work. \n\nIn my case, I fell in love with the C4Model and the way Simon talked about context at different levels and focusing on one thing at a time. But where C4 focused on systems > applications > components > code, I needed something that looked up and not down to the code. The platform I supported is made up of ~250 applications which talked to a middleware platform even larger which talked to the legacy not a mainframe but essentially a mainframe. I needed something that started at the enterprise level like group/locations which contain platforms which host systems made up of applications deployed to different tiers. \n\nSo over the past five years I’ve built a helper system with a SQLite database which tracks my entities and the relationships, an ASP.NET web app which pulls the data from the db and renders dot output which I feed to Graphviz which renders the nodes and edges as an SVG image that I display in the browser which I can then drill up or down levels to change my context and what is displayed. I can then push a modified version of the dot graph into our wiki on to pages for each location / platform / system / tier / application. Oh, and I had someone build a utility which scans our config files to pull any external endpoints on a quarterly basis. I use that output to update my app links in my database. \n\nAnd yes, there are enterprise tools that can do this type of stuff for you but for a variety of reasons it is easier to just entertain myself with this project versus trying to jump through the bureaucracy hoops. But I think the biggest frustration is that so many people look at them and don’t quite get the value of having a canonical taxonomy of our applications and references to/from other applications. For me, when the latest consultant comes in and says we should replace the old SOAP service and it shouldn’t be that hard, I can show them the 30 other apps that call that SOAP service and all the apps that depend on that app. It brings reality into the conversation quickly. Or when our client doesn’t understand why we can’t just move to the cloud, I show a diagram with 200 applications and all of their relationships and interconnectedness and it usually gets quiet.\n\nAnyway, I like what I’ve built. Wish I could share. I know others have built more impressive things. But this scratched an itch I had for a long time.",

At one point the design gets so huge that nobody knows anymore which change in the code requires an update in the design.\n\nI know what people will say now: You are doing it wrong! You should first update the design and then start the implementation! The point is, especially when it is about refactoring (renaming/splitting/introducing new classes, moving methods around etc.) it is much more cumbersome to refactor a \"text\" than it is with actual code where the IDE knows all the dependencies and can trace where methods are called, classes are used and do the update resulting in a consistent state.\n\nMy experience what works out to some extent:\n\n\\- If you really do the design first (prescriptive), then you should be able to generate code or sync your existing code base with it\n\n\\- If you are happy with a design that documents your code (descriptive), then you could e.g. create a script that automatically generates PlantUML diagrams etc. based on your class structure\n\n\\- A good tracing also helps e.g. if you can trace design items to your code base (e.g. by introducing special tags) then everybody should better see where an update is necessary",

Documentation updates can potentially be automated, but still need review.\n\nIf you and your group can maintain the discipline to carry that process out, then the documentation stays more in sync. Practically speaking: between the force to deliver direct value ASAP and people making general mistakes, the drift is inevitable over time.\n\n**Another idea:** Identify which documentation is expected to drift, and treat it as disposable. Maintain the rest, naturally infrequently.\n\nAnother comment had an excellent point that there are architecture docs, and technical docs. Architecture docs should not be expected to change often, and updates to them can be enforced during PR review when the reality of the architecture changes. Technical documentation can be used as a launching pad to communicate ideas and get an implementation started up, but since these implementations can change requirements so often, the documentation might not be worth keeping once the software is written.\n\nSomething like user documentation might be another thing entirely, which could need updates frequently but is also important to keep and maintain; whether that is an external document, an in-application document, guide, or tutorial, or something else. Avoiding duplication of information reduces maintenance needs, but I guess that has to be balanced with formatting information properly for different audiences that need it too.",

Eventually it would very difficult humans to track.\n\nThe model-driven, text-based approach you're experimenting with is the right direction I feel. \n\nBy the way, I'm building something in this space, focused on making architectural knowledge queryable rather than maintaining static diagrams.

As per another comment, it's just a way of moving data around.\n\nEvent sourcing is when your actual source of truth is a list of events rather than a traditional relational model, and the only way to reason about the current state of your data is to replay those events and aggregate them into a meaningful model (which is usually snapshotted at regularly intervals to save you having to replay every event from the start of time just to run simple queries against your data). It's inspired by accounting ledgers, and typically paired with CQRS, which means different consumers of your events can do their own aggregation and maintain their own \"projections\".\n\nIn its most purist form, this is often not a great fit for a lot of problem spaces, so a lot of real-world systems are built on hybrid architectures instead, meaning they adopt parts of event sourcing, but the system of record remains a traditional database.",

If you read about modular design, you gonna see there's no \"contract layer\" (you asked for modular design, not layered architecture after all). \n\nIn practice, in lean design (as opposite to enterprise designs), there are two common cases are:\n\n1. Module A delegates its infrastructure code to Module A'. In such case module A defines all the interfaces, and module A' implements them. Example: \"DeviceRegistration\" and \"DeviceRegistration - Infrastructure\" modules. This way \"DeviceRegistration\" has no infra code and doesn't depend on the \"DeviceRegistration - Infrastructure\".\n\n2. Module A needs to delegate flow to Module B. In such case there is a direct dependency, and no amount of tricks with separate abstraction layer won't change it. Put the interfaces in the upstream module, and let downstream module implement them. It the flow is unidirectional, direct dependency between modules, where you invoke classes of the mobule B is fine. It could be as easy as exposing a Facade Pattern. \n\nI was many Java or C# implementations with many abstraction layers, but I think that in the end it's Go that nailed it. It's even built-in into its philosophy by \"consumers to define interfaces instead of producers\" mantra.",

It'll also keep services and interfaces in sync based on direct code changes as well. I also want to provide a nice context map to show which contexts rely on other contexts. It'll try to enforce the basic rules of what structural elements can use, implement or inject others. I'll probably have a CLI interface that complements the UI which could be used in pipelines as well to validate those basic rules. The code will remain mostly directly editable.

I'd love the opinions of others here on this. \n\nMy take is that these tools encode not just a particular style, but define a framework by the nature of how they work. If you want to do anything, you have to do it in a particular way.\n\nSo these \"tools\" \"become\" \"frameworks\". \n\nWhat's a framework? I'd say it's an enforced collection of patterns. (which is what you'll do - you'll select a finite set of patterns that this tool will realize)\n\nBut what's a pattern? Why do we use patterns? I'd say, we use patterns to work around the shortcomings of some environment. It's a way of dealing with reality so we can achieve the outcomes we need. \n\nThe problem is that any finite selection of patterns can only cover a subset of the continuum of implementations required for our business cases. To deal with this, developers sometimes come up with new patterns to deal with the canonical way of doing things. Sometimes that works out fine. Sometimes it doesn't make sense at all.\n\nAs languages and environments and patterns evolve, it sometimes stops making sense to bend over backwards to appease the framework, and working outside of the framework becomes easier. At some point the frameworks becomes either so sidelined or adapted and specialized so it stops being the universal panacea it was supposed to be.\n\nAnd then someone invents a new framework to supplant all these specializations, and the cycle begins anew \n\n# 🤔\n\n---\n\n> I've been told a bunch of times that this kind of architecture isn't worth it, or it's too academic and overcomplicated. So I'm really giving into my own desires to see how it works for me\n\nI think that's good. There's a nugget of truth in everything, and if you have the energy and time and will to prospect for that bit of truth, that's perfect. That's probably the best way to become a good architect, especially if no one else has to suffer from your exploratory decisions lol.",

IMO people should stop this indiscriminate layering nonsense and focus on actual abstractions and designing actual robust APIs (when possible and needed, otherwise it's perfectly fine to write code in a direct style).

                  "text": "For example, compilers often have IRs (intermediate representations) that are carefully considered to allow translation of the code as well as optimizations (which might require combining knowledge of different languages or different CPUs without ending up with a combinatorial explosion of corner cases, some of those pseudoinstructions might not even resemble any concrete instruction). A database may provide a set of primitive operations that are enough to write applications within a certain consistency model and with certain transactional capabilities, possibly with a higher-level / convenience API on to make it easier for simple use cases. A compression library provides APIs that are generally robust for a wide variety of use cases so you don't need to go make changes to it to use it in your own application (and they're not changing the API surface all the time). An operating system kernel needs to provide a driver model such that a diverse set of hardware devices can be managed (some only require initialization, some require to be notified before being powered-down and so on). A JSON parser might provide both streaming and non-streaming parsers (building the entire representation in memory upfront) in a convenient way and for a wide variety of users. All these tend to require rather careful consideration.\n\nIn contrast and at least in a practical sense, stuff related to layered architectures often tends to be applied blindly and as a general recipe, being little more than arbitrary scaffolding. This tends to be compounded by people trying to split work top-down in a trivial way. It's easy to say \"hey, someone should do auth and someone should do the books endpoint\". But then the auth stuff could just be one or two calls into the framework / auth library and it's instead blown to an entire component that barely adds anything (and might even impose needless restrictions). In such cases nobody's really doing any real work of abstracting stuff, they're just writing wrappers for straightforward calls.\n\nSupposedly this sometimes protects against changing requirements but I find that's usually not true, it's just a place where you end up putting ugly hacks that would have been better fixed by large-scale refactoring. It reduces visibility into code and changes because everything is 7 useless layers deep. It makes it \"easy\" to write 100k LOC of code that barely does anything concrete. It makes it hard to write composable helpers because everything is encapsulated too tightly yet it's not robust enough to handle all reasonable use cases. And to some degree it shouldn't be, that's what the framework is for, while you're writing a very specific and concrete application.\n\nOn a somewhat related note, I think a good and even simpler test for code writing ability is to look at how people write functions/methods. Do they split them wisely? One could do either of (1) one big function or (2) a hundred very small functions that presume a bunch of invariants (\"I'm always being passed a non-empty array of at most 3 elements, I'll crash otherwise\"). Those are both pretty poor choices, usually. Or they can be mindful about stuff and split on natural boundaries and where there's least resistance, for example by making a helper that compares JSON objects a certain way and makes at least some sense on its own (either for DRY purposes or simply because it's clearer / more testable on its own). This kind of soft separation is very useful, because you're grouping things logically, making them easier to write / review / confirm they're working, while also allowing the possibility of refactoring at will. But it's not something that's just a recipe and it heavily depends on experience and what the code really does.\n\nThat being said, some layering may be fine, though. It's just that you have to be conservative about it because it has a cost. And it's often overused.",

It is a simple structure of logical components, but behavior and requirements (among many other things) are all constructs humans layer on top of the logical components to make sense of it all. It exists detached and purely for our benefit, so that we may design more elegant software systems. The software itself doesn't benefit from behavior analysis or architectural fitness or performance... It just *does*. Same as with Systems Engineering.\n\nSo, separating the real from the imagined we can see that the behavior of a system is one viewpoint we would design. The requirements is another synonym of behavior, but a subset of behaviors that is strictly required. Non-functional requirements are still required, just harder for stakeholders to articulate. Things that if catastrophe arrived, the stakeholders would say 'of course I want that!' Do they want it reasonably performant? Do they want it to be observed so errors are clear and remedies quickly? Do they want failover in case a data center goes out?\n\nAll that to say, your perception of a sequential flow of designing a software intensive system is incorrect.\n\n1) Start with functional requirements\n2) Add non-functional requirements\n3) Identify True Constraints (versus imagined constraints)\n4) Decide what to optimize for, in pursuit of the larger goal\n5) Use comfortable tools & techniques to design your system\n6) Use the previous 5 steps as a guide to redesign what you just made, but to be easily manufactured (coded, released, maintained, and deprecated)",

          "text": "Really solid breakdown, especially the priorities-over-pros/cons framing. That reframe alone would've saved me from a few bad decisions early on.\n\nOne thing I keep running into though - the RFC process works great when people actually have the context to evaluate options. But in practice, the architectural knowledge needed to write a good RFC (system boundaries, existing decisions, dependency chains) is often locked in someone's head or scattered across old docs.\n\nThe \"nobody comments\" problem you mentioned? I think a one of the reason might be people \"can't\" comment meaningfully because they don't have enough visibility into the system to know if Option B will break something three services away. Could they be just hesitant?\n\nThanks for writing this up.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m transitionating into an Architecture role at my company and have the opportunity to define our observability strategy from scratch, giving us the chance to redesign the architecture for greater resilience and scalability if needed.\n\nI want to avoid just dumping default metrics (CPU, RAM, generic HTTP counts) onto a dashboard that nobody looks at. I want to build a baseline that actually reveals the architectural health and stability of the platform.\n\nI have been reading several blog posts like [this](https://raygun.com/blog/server-performance-metrics/). but I know theory often diverges from reality, so I wanted to get different perspectives from the community.\n\nIf you were auditing a system from scratch and could only pick a handful of metrics to determine if the architecture is sound (or burning down), what would be on your \"Must-Have\" list?\n\nThanks for sharing your wisdom!",
