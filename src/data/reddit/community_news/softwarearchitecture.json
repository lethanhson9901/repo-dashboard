And I came from a non-IT background, so, I need to do some hardwork and will be slow in catching up to other folks who already know about IT.\n\nNow, I want to start Systems Design. As of now, I am mostly into Data Engineering (most of my work was preparing APIs to fetch data, refine it, store it in Cloud and then, use Cloud Services like AWS Glue to perform ETL services and store it in different endpoints).\n\nMy goal -> Go for full fledged Data Engineering and then becomes a Solutions Architect.\n\nSo, I need to learn Systems Design concepts. And while I will take up some Udemy courses and follow some YouTube channels, I still want to read the concepts using a traditional way. And so, I want at least 1-2 books to read.\n\nAnother thing is, they are asked in the interviews.\n\nSo, (to all the senior folks, or those who have knowledge in this field), please recommend some self-sufficient Systems Design books that I can read. I would prefer 1, but 1-2 books would be okay. If even that is not possible, recommend at least 1 book that will help me with my journey on Systems Design concepts.",

Instead of being coupled by deployments, scaling, autonomy, etc, they're coupled by producer and consumers. It's a very valid tradeoff depending on what you're building. \n\nWhich means, yes, if you're coupling metric is deployability, then it does decouple. \n\n> If I need to talk to you, I don't want a middle man.\n\nThis is naive and implies that all work should and can be done in process. Or that every problem can be solved via in-process, direct HTTP calls (which has it's own issues). \n\n> unless you have very specific constraints like requiring multiple services listening to the same event, or something else.\n\nEvent-driven architecture is simply communicating by events. It doesn't matter if there's a single or 200 services, it's still event-driven if it's communicating via events. And here's the biggest secret about EDA: It's literally the way most domains work. When this happens, then this happens. \n\n\"When a patient is admitted to the hospital, then a notification needs sent to their physician\". That's event-driven. And when you work in non-trivial domains, writing classes with 200 if/else checks starts to become untenable. And communicating via events has the added benefit of not only telling you the what, but the why as well. \n\n>  If your response will take too much time, there are lots of other patterns to use.\n\nYes, like using async messaging via an event-driven architecture.",

We definitely had a case like that and in the end we merged the two services into one. Yeah it's a bigger code-base now but it doesn't depend on synchronous calls. We still have like 20 microservices left in the end, but those are genuine microservices that communicate with Kafka asynchronously.",

              "text": "The problem with using databases as a queue is more to do with the polling interacting with locking/visibility and the way they handle concurrency. If you're not polling by issuing SQL statements you'll be fine. And if your queue is very low throughput and second-level latency is OK you may be fine as well, even if the tool is not a great fit and you can easily write a broken queue.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a high-throughput queue in a database. Your readers do, say  'UPDATE mytable SET processing=TRUE WHERE id=(SELECT id FROM mytable WHERE NOT processing ORDER BY created_at ASC FOR UPDATE LIMIT 1) AND NOT processing RETURNING ...'. If many transactions do this at once they're all going to find the same row and try to lock it. One query gets the queued task and all the others have to sit and wait for it before they can even try to get the next one.\n\nPerhaps SKIP LOCKED would help, but having not tried running it I'm not sure I've got this query exactly right even without it. How does this work with, say, PostgreSQL's MVCC? Will I get UPDATEs which update zero rows? Possibly, if the SELECTs can see a row viewed as it was at the start of the transaction that has since been updated by another concurrent transaction to processing=TRUE. If so, it would have been broken if I hadn't added 'AND NOT processing'.\n\nI imagine heavy writes to a very small part of the index on created_at isn't going to help, either.\n\nYou're not going to have any problems like that if you're just storing what is effectively the message body in a DB and passing references via queues.\n\nThere are other designs for database queues but I don't think you'll find anything safe, easy and high-throughput. At the very least you need to be intimately familiar with your databases locking and performance characteristics and you'll probably still find yourself repeatedly debugging performance bottlenecks.",

We specialize in e-commerce enterprise projects. Most of our projects are between 0.8 and 2 million USD.\n\nPart of my duties is vetting incoming work from the sales team and getting it sized/estimated before a contract is drawn up. What has surprised me is how much guess work is happening at this stage. I'm honestly used to being a delivery team member with several weeks of discovery. Now I'll travel across borders to do preliminary requirements gathering and I'll be lucky if the client gives me 4 hours for a $3mil USD project.\n\nI understand that I'm not truly estimating scope as much as validating rough targets while leaving discovery to the delivery teams. But part of me is stressing about the guess work involved.\n\nWhich leads to my questions for the group:\n- Can you tell me about your experiences with this situation? Is it something similar? Do you have any horror stories (missing requirements)?\n- What does your estimation process look like?\n- How confident are you in your pre discovery estimates?\n- Do you have any requirement gathering activities you like to do with clients?\n\nFull disclosure, I'm working on a tool to make this easier on myself but I wanted to hear how others are facing this.",

Putting it on paper can reveal stuff that they hadn't thought about, or were tertiary but important, but it's gets it all out. Ideally you have designs already, if you don't then make shitty drawings to fill in the gaps and tease out the features being asked for.\n\nThis puts things in boxes. Stuff you've seen before - lots of CRUD work - usually sits in regular looking boxes. You can estimate these easily and there's no surprises, give it an estimate, make it green, move on.\n\nThen there's stuff that's a bit weird, maybe it's CRUD but depends on something you can't control or haven't seen before. Make it orange, divvy it up more, add time boxed discovery, or inflated percentage.\n\nThen there's blue boxes, sane sounding stuff but you haven't done it, it requires inventing things, systems, models, it's a bit faffy. More subdivision of the ask, more inflated numbers.\n\nAnd finally you'll get red boxes. Don't know what it means, don't have enough info, can't be right, can't estimate it.  These are the ones where you get a little surgical and create questions for the stakeholder (customer), and it's good to make them kinda open and get the customer to talk about what they really want. We throw away all sorts of requirements when we go back with open questions and let people talk.\n\nAnd then you pack it all up, look at it from on high, add 10% to the estimate for the customer, cut 10% from what the developer sees.\n\nYou'll also get a different experience if you have a well oiled velocity-dialed team, or a bunch of specialists.  When you have specialists it's good to also throw together a gantt (work swimlanes) to assign who's working on what for how long, align the work blocks, watch people squirm when it's all laid out.\n\nThe more you do it the faster you'll get, you can run these meetings lightning fast and the hardest part is getting developers to be awake and give honest numbers.  Get them to give you realistic numbers, not pleasing numbers. On-high will always squeeze you for cheaper work, don't let the developers squeeze themselves.

The far you estimate in time, the less accurate your estimates. You can assume typical features required by your customer vertical/industry. Identify things that will need deeper analysis and organize them in future iterations. Use a basic/medium/high complexity score for each feature and assign them some standard development time.\n4. Share risks with your customer. Explain the milestones that need deeper analysis that will be done at the time and may cause the project to extend.\n5.

              "text": "I love the spirit and wit of this comment, but having been knee-deep in DCB in the recent months, here are some additional perspectives on the topic from my recent experience, that hopefully may enlighten the reader on what \"unlearning\" and \"learning it again\" may mean.\n\nThe best definition of an aggregate that I came across is that of a \"consistency and concurrency boundary\".  The aggregate is responsible for validating business invariants it encapsulates, and, as a corollary, you can't write concurrently to same aggregate. This can be painful in many natural hierarchical relationships that arise when modeling any domain, the classical DCB example being that of a \"Course\" and a \"Student\". As far as I know, without DCB, the \"correct\" way of handling cross-aggregate constraints is to leverage some form or orchestration with compensation such as a saga, but this feels extremely heavy in systems for which we don't expect significant load.\n\nDCB's idea is that, in order to make any business decision, the decision will be based on a set of relevant events, and the consistency / concurrency boundary is not fixed to a predefined entity (aggregate), but instead based on the stability of the event set used for the decision. For instance, if all you need to enroll a student abc into a course xyz is that the course exists and the student exists, then your event set for consistency purposes is \"(COURSE\\_CREATED OR COURSE\\_CANCELLED) where course\\_id = 'xyz'\" and \"STUDENT\\_CREATED where student\\_id = abc\".\n\nThe \"unlearning\" part is that, for anyone having struggled with aggregate-induced modeling problems, DCB feels magical. No more aggregate, only events. Need a new command ? Ask what events it needs for consistency, project them in the relevant shape, and you're done. Amazing ! But soon, you will have 12 commands and 15 event types, every command will be building its own projection, which is basically a small model of the domain, and everything will be hard to understand. We have traded rigidity for chaos. Whoops.\n\nSo here's the relearning that happened to me: aggregates still make sense in the context of DCB. There is a \"Course\" aggregate, and a \"Student\" aggregate, they have a well-defined projection from the event store, and they handle (almost) all invariants that are related to them. They are also natural entities to create read-models for for UI and integration purposes. DCB is here still, but rather than everything defining its own little custom projection, we define custom projections in a very restricted manner, only for cases where true \"cross-aggregates\" invariants should be enforced, and we expect that loading the full aggregates would lead to concurrency problems.\n\nWhat I've observed in practice is that our commands broadly fall into two categories:  \n\\- Commands that are interested in one single aggregate, and take rich business decisions on that aggregate based on complex state.  \n\\- Commands that are interested in multiple aggregates, but that only need to make \"simple\" decisions, and work off a small set of distinct events (typically existential events such as creation / cancellations)\n\nThe first kind should use full \"aggregates\", even when not strictly necessary. Only the second kind should use custom projections, and even for those, I found that some form of limited \"existential\" projection can be shared across multiple commands (e.g. \"Enroll student is course / remove student from course\").",

Do you have any example of something that went into the \"hard to understand\" territory?\n\nBecause how I see it, even if you have these custom projections that otherwise would be on the aggreagte, they still would only be bound to the one tag of that aggregate. Nothing really changes except the ability to use per-property precision in the folding of events into state. Get all of those custom projections together, and now you have your traditional aggregate again.\n\nThe commands that do span multiple tags still benefit over the traditional way, ofcourse.",

And remember, you will only need to fully load the aggregate root on _write_ operations which will constitute less than 10%(or even 1%). So I wouldn’t worry too much about it.

I don't think there is anything wrong with having multiple aggregates in a domain/bounded context. If you try to keep everything in one aggregate, depending on the complexity of the bounded context, you're going to have something akin to a god class that is very hard to understand before you start having memory problems (because that aggregate will have to be the entry point to ALL domain behavior).\n\nThere are ways to model the \"a restaurant can’t have more than 50 branches\" rule without having the branch be an entity in the restaurant aggregate. The restaurant has to own that rule, yes, but it only needs to know how many branches it has, not their names, menus, and employees. So the restaurant only holds a list of branch IDs, and it checks their count on an addBranch method. If it needs to be transaction-safe but you don't want to deal with cross-aggregate transactions, you can use a saga or reservation pattern.\n\nBut everything is a trade-off, and you have to make the trade-off analysis yourself. Multiple aggregates might actually make things less readable and more complex if you have a lot of these cross-aggregate rules.",

I would suggest when generating it, use a broader approach for the primary file (high level concepts), and then build out more detailed individual documents for each specific subset.  Mermaid diagrams can start to get a bit wacky as they grow. \n\nOnce you have mapped out the infrastructure you can save it to your repo and then add it as a reference claude must review at the start of each session in your claude.md.

People filled it out like a checklist to get approval, not to actually think. Same problem you identified with scoring, the form becomes the point instead of the thinking behind it.\n\nHonestly the most useful documentation I've produced is a one-page list of decisions that burned us and why. No framework, just we picked X, it broke because of Y, next time consider Z. New engineers on the team read that page and learn more from it than from any architecture decision record we've ever written.\n\nYour simplicity characteristic weighted high by default is smart though, making boring the default that you have to argue against instead of the other way around would've saved me from a few disasters. We once went with a microservices approach for something that a single postgres instance could've handled for years, took us eight months to unwind that decision.\n\nBut yeah hope that actually answers your question instead of just rambling about my war stories lol",

Don’t make permissions dynamic.  \n  \nMake **permissions static**, and roles dynamic per tenant. Define all possible actions in your system as static keys in code order: create, order, view, order: delete, sales: view, driver: assign.   \n  \nThese never change at runtime. They’re referenced in both frontend and backend checks.\n\nThen each restaurant (tenant) can create whatever roles they want and attach those static permissions to them.\n\nRestaurant A:\n\n* Cashier → order: view, sales: view\n\nRestaurant B:\n\n* CounterGuy → order: create\n\nSame permission set.

The goal is to create \"agent-ready\" architectural artifacts that we can feed into a Git-based context warehouse. Once the architecture is locked, autonomous LLM agents read those files to generate the epics, user stories, and eventually the code itself.\n\nTo stop the AI from hallucinating system boundaries and dependencies, we’ve completely banned visual-only tools like [Draw.io](http://Draw.io) or Miro exports. Everything has to be \"machine-first\"—meaning text-to-diagram code embedded inside Markdown documents.\n\nMy current plan is to standardize on the **C4 Model** using **Mermaid.js** or **Structurizr DSL**, alongside strict **Markdown ADRs** (MADR) and **OpenAPI/AsyncAPI** for contracts. Since LLMs have a lot of training data on C4 and Mermaid, it seems like the safest bet.\n\nBut I’m wondering if we are just shoehorning a human legacy framework into an AI workflow.\n\n**My questions for the community:**\n\n1. Is there a better architectural framework or DSL emerging specifically for human-AI collaboration?\n2. Have you found any schemas (YAML/JSON/Markdown hybrids) that give LLM agents better semantic understanding of data flows and system constraints than Mermaid?\n\nWould love to hear how others are solving this \"human-to-machine\" architecture handoff!",

Structurizr allows you to create a single model (with multiple views), which LLMs have a much better time querying compared to a potentially disconnected and out-of-sync collection of Mermaid diagrams.\n\nI built a [simple MCP server for Structurizr](https://github.com/structurizr/structurizr/tree/main/structurizr-mcp), but you actually don't need it - just feed your LLM the `workspace.json` file and it has everything it needs, especially if you're embedding Markdown/AsciiDoc documentation/ADRs too. I'm not a huge of using LLMs to generate solutions, but they are very good at querying an existing model.",

So, we started using various text-to-image tools, like mermaid, to have both in a single place.    \nMy question is, besides structurizr dsl, is there another tool like that, with the specific purpose of conveying information about software architectures, and not just diagrams in general?
