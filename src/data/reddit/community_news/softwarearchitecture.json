And I came from a non-IT background, so, I need to do some hardwork and will be slow in catching up to other folks who already know about IT.\n\nNow, I want to start Systems Design. As of now, I am mostly into Data Engineering (most of my work was preparing APIs to fetch data, refine it, store it in Cloud and then, use Cloud Services like AWS Glue to perform ETL services and store it in different endpoints).\n\nMy goal -> Go for full fledged Data Engineering and then becomes a Solutions Architect.\n\nSo, I need to learn Systems Design concepts. And while I will take up some Udemy courses and follow some YouTube channels, I still want to read the concepts using a traditional way. And so, I want at least 1-2 books to read.\n\nAnother thing is, they are asked in the interviews.\n\nSo, (to all the senior folks, or those who have knowledge in this field), please recommend some self-sufficient Systems Design books that I can read. I would prefer 1, but 1-2 books would be okay. If even that is not possible, recommend at least 1 book that will help me with my journey on Systems Design concepts.",

Inside a monolith you have compile time safety. The moment you split something into a separate service communicating over HTTP, a field rename or a type change becomes invisible until something breaks at runtime.\n\nSo if you start with a monolith, structure it with clear module boundaries and explicit interfaces between domains. That way when the time comes to extract a service, you already know what the contract looks like. Teams that skip this step end up with a distributed monolith that has all the downsides of microservices and none of the benefits.\n\nTo answer your question: yes, monolith first every time.

Even when it comes to writing code, AI agent are far from having \"solved\" it.\n\n_A Philosophy of Software Design_ by John Ousterhout makes the distinction between tactical coding and strategic coding. AI agents are tactical tornados; they will get the job done, but they don't care about technical debt or the maintainability of their answers. They write, write, write, until they are confronted by their own mess, and then fail to write any more coherent code.\n\nUnless your codebase has solid foundations and you spend a lot of time improving these foundations, using strategic code, your codebase will become a mess.\n\nHow much time should you spend on human-made strategic code vs. agent-made tactical code? I don't know. John Ousterhout proposed 20% strategic / 80% tactical, but he wrote his book before AI agents were a thing.\n\nThis barely scratches the surface. As a developer, coding is just one part of my job. I spend the majority of my time communicating with stakeholders, designing solutions, managing projects, etc. AI agents can help me brainstorm and put my thoughts into words, but I doubt an AI agent would be able to replace me.",

              "text": "I love the spirit and wit of this comment, but having been knee-deep in DCB in the recent months, here are some additional perspectives on the topic from my recent experience, that hopefully may enlighten the reader on what \"unlearning\" and \"learning it again\" may mean.\n\nThe best definition of an aggregate that I came across is that of a \"consistency and concurrency boundary\".  The aggregate is responsible for validating business invariants it encapsulates, and, as a corollary, you can't write concurrently to same aggregate. This can be painful in many natural hierarchical relationships that arise when modeling any domain, the classical DCB example being that of a \"Course\" and a \"Student\". As far as I know, without DCB, the \"correct\" way of handling cross-aggregate constraints is to leverage some form or orchestration with compensation such as a saga, but this feels extremely heavy in systems for which we don't expect significant load.\n\nDCB's idea is that, in order to make any business decision, the decision will be based on a set of relevant events, and the consistency / concurrency boundary is not fixed to a predefined entity (aggregate), but instead based on the stability of the event set used for the decision. For instance, if all you need to enroll a student abc into a course xyz is that the course exists and the student exists, then your event set for consistency purposes is \"(COURSE\\_CREATED OR COURSE\\_CANCELLED) where course\\_id = 'xyz'\" and \"STUDENT\\_CREATED where student\\_id = abc\".\n\nThe \"unlearning\" part is that, for anyone having struggled with aggregate-induced modeling problems, DCB feels magical. No more aggregate, only events. Need a new command ? Ask what events it needs for consistency, project them in the relevant shape, and you're done. Amazing ! But soon, you will have 12 commands and 15 event types, every command will be building its own projection, which is basically a small model of the domain, and everything will be hard to understand. We have traded rigidity for chaos. Whoops.\n\nSo here's the relearning that happened to me: aggregates still make sense in the context of DCB. There is a \"Course\" aggregate, and a \"Student\" aggregate, they have a well-defined projection from the event store, and they handle (almost) all invariants that are related to them. They are also natural entities to create read-models for for UI and integration purposes. DCB is here still, but rather than everything defining its own little custom projection, we define custom projections in a very restricted manner, only for cases where true \"cross-aggregates\" invariants should be enforced, and we expect that loading the full aggregates would lead to concurrency problems.\n\nWhat I've observed in practice is that our commands broadly fall into two categories:  \n\\- Commands that are interested in one single aggregate, and take rich business decisions on that aggregate based on complex state.  \n\\- Commands that are interested in multiple aggregates, but that only need to make \"simple\" decisions, and work off a small set of distinct events (typically existential events such as creation / cancellations)\n\nThe first kind should use full \"aggregates\", even when not strictly necessary. Only the second kind should use custom projections, and even for those, I found that some form of limited \"existential\" projection can be shared across multiple commands (e.g. \"Enroll student is course / remove student from course\").",

Do you have any example of something that went into the \"hard to understand\" territory?\n\nBecause how I see it, even if you have these custom projections that otherwise would be on the aggreagte, they still would only be bound to the one tag of that aggregate. Nothing really changes except the ability to use per-property precision in the folding of events into state. Get all of those custom projections together, and now you have your traditional aggregate again.\n\nThe commands that do span multiple tags still benefit over the traditional way, ofcourse.",

And remember, you will only need to fully load the aggregate root on _write_ operations which will constitute less than 10%(or even 1%). So I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Around 1MB of data is fine. Do a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation of how large your aggregate can grow.

If you try to keep everything in one aggregate, depending on the complexity of the bounded context, you're going to have something akin to a god class that is very hard to understand before you start having memory problems (because that aggregate will have to be the entry point to ALL domain behavior).\n\nThere are ways to model the \"a restaurant can’t have more than 50 branches\" rule without having the branch be an entity in the restaurant aggregate. The restaurant has to own that rule, yes, but it only needs to know how many branches it has, not their names, menus, and employees. So the restaurant only holds a list of branch IDs, and it checks their count on an addBranch method. If it needs to be transaction-safe but you don't want to deal with cross-aggregate transactions, you can use a saga or reservation pattern.\n\nBut everything is a trade-off, and you have to make the trade-off analysis yourself. Multiple aggregates might actually make things less readable and more complex if you have a lot of these cross-aggregate rules.",

All of those events combined is your consisteny boundary. Traditionally this is what an aggregate does as well, it puts all those events in the same stream to keep everything within the stream consistent. However, defining an aggregate can oftentimes be confusing as we have the tendency to put everything \"the\" aggregate, even events which should not have any relation to eachother (name vs status for example). \n\nIn this case, if the name/state of restaurants do not share a consistency boundary with branches, then you dont need those to be in the same \"aggregate\".

We specialize in e-commerce enterprise projects. Most of our projects are between 0.8 and 2 million USD.\n\nPart of my duties is vetting incoming work from the sales team and getting it sized/estimated before a contract is drawn up. What has surprised me is how much guess work is happening at this stage. I'm honestly used to being a delivery team member with several weeks of discovery. Now I'll travel across borders to do preliminary requirements gathering and I'll be lucky if the client gives me 4 hours for a $3mil USD project.\n\nI understand that I'm not truly estimating scope as much as validating rough targets while leaving discovery to the delivery teams. But part of me is stressing about the guess work involved.\n\nWhich leads to my questions for the group:\n- Can you tell me about your experiences with this situation? Is it something similar? Do you have any horror stories (missing requirements)?\n- What does your estimation process look like?\n- How confident are you in your pre discovery estimates?\n- Do you have any requirement gathering activities you like to do with clients?\n\nFull disclosure, I'm working on a tool to make this easier on myself but I wanted to hear how others are facing this.",

Putting it on paper can reveal stuff that they hadn't thought about, or were tertiary but important, but it's gets it all out. Ideally you have designs already, if you don't then make shitty drawings to fill in the gaps and tease out the features being asked for.\n\nThis puts things in boxes. Stuff you've seen before - lots of CRUD work - usually sits in regular looking boxes. You can estimate these easily and there's no surprises, give it an estimate, make it green, move on.\n\nThen there's stuff that's a bit weird, maybe it's CRUD but depends on something you can't control or haven't seen before. Make it orange, divvy it up more, add time boxed discovery, or inflated percentage.\n\nThen there's blue boxes, sane sounding stuff but you haven't done it, it requires inventing things, systems, models, it's a bit faffy. More subdivision of the ask, more inflated numbers.\n\nAnd finally you'll get red boxes. Don't know what it means, don't have enough info, can't be right, can't estimate it.  These are the ones where you get a little surgical and create questions for the stakeholder (customer), and it's good to make them kinda open and get the customer to talk about what they really want. We throw away all sorts of requirements when we go back with open questions and let people talk.\n\nAnd then you pack it all up, look at it from on high, add 10% to the estimate for the customer, cut 10% from what the developer sees.\n\nYou'll also get a different experience if you have a well oiled velocity-dialed team, or a bunch of specialists.  When you have specialists it's good to also throw together a gantt (work swimlanes) to assign who's working on what for how long, align the work blocks, watch people squirm when it's all laid out.\n\nThe more you do it the faster you'll get, you can run these meetings lightning fast and the hardest part is getting developers to be awake and give honest numbers.  Get them to give you realistic numbers, not pleasing numbers. On-high will always squeeze you for cheaper work, don't let the developers squeeze themselves. Remember to ask about testing, UAT, Release plan, definition of done, operation manuals, docs.",

The far you estimate in time, the less accurate your estimates. You can assume typical features required by your customer vertical/industry. Identify things that will need deeper analysis and organize them in future iterations. Use a basic/medium/high complexity score for each feature and assign them some standard development time.\n4. Share risks with your customer. Explain the milestones that need deeper analysis that will be done at the time and may cause the project to extend.\n5. Deliver working features early.\n\nWhat will happen is that your customer will take your proposal with a better mindset.\n\nIn the end you will estimate 8 months and your customer will answer we need it in 3 months.

Then grab the next use case add it to the system. You may have to change the existing code and architecture as well. The design evolves as more use cases and requirements are added/discovered.

People filled it out like a checklist to get approval, not to actually think. Same problem you identified with scoring, the form becomes the point instead of the thinking behind it.\n\nHonestly the most useful documentation I've produced is a one-page list of decisions that burned us and why. No framework, just we picked X, it broke because of Y, next time consider Z.

We once went with a microservices approach for something that a single postgres instance could've handled for years, took us eight months to unwind that decision.\n\nBut yeah hope that actually answers your question instead of just rambling about my war stories lol",

      "text": "I stumbled upon two rare architectural patterns: *Sandwich* (which AFAIK was never formulated before) and *Cell* (which has different meanings in WSO2 and Amazon documentation).\n\n[*Sandwich*](https://itnext.io/sandwich-architecture-3d0de71503f6) is a metapattern - a family of patterns with identical topology (structural diagram) and similar function. It describes a system with a modular or distributed domain level sandwiched between monolithic application and data layers (hence the name). This topology is found in *Blackboard Architecture*, *Space-Based Architecture*, and *Service-Based Architecture* by Mark Richards. I suspect that many real-world *Sandwiches* go under the radar being dismissed as transitionary architectures between *Layers* and *(Micro-)Services*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nmiapc9lbvlg1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d0eee81766451b2c7ba7cde90e7f2321b2fe248\n\n[*Cell*](https://itnext.io/cell-777e87543e93) (aka *Cluster* or *Domain*) is a pattern for treating a cluster of closely cooperating services as a single system component. The *Cell*'s internals are isolated from its environment by a *Cell Gateway* (for incoming requests), *Adapters* (one for every external service used by the *Cell*) and, in some cases, *Ambassador Plugins* (that allow other services to inject their business logic into the *Cell*), which makes *Cell* to be a kind of *Hexagonal Architecture* with a distributed core.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jjk7yfobvlg1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e36f8db003e3b8e4d400594c7fab186e1fcd391\n\nAs both patterns describe coupled (sub)systems, a *Sandwich* fits well inside a *Cell*.\n\nSadly, for now both articles are on Medium, which is hard to read, and which likes to show a \"please register\" popup (which is discardable but still annoying). The patterns should appear on the Metapatterns website in a couple of weeks (that are needed to integrate them into the pattern language).",

[This is the postgres documentation on using EXCLUDE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-EXCLUDE)\n\n>`CHECK` constraints: For validating data at the source\n>\n>CHECK constraints allow you to specify that the value in a column must satisfy a Boolean expression. They enforce rules like \"age must be between 0 and 120\" or \"end_date must be after start_date.\"\n\n[This is the postgres documentation on using CHECK](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-CHECK-CONSTRAINTS)\n\nI'm personally wary of pushing my business logic into the database.  I don't want my database responsible for checking constraints - if anything is reaching the database it should be validated in the business logic before reaching the data store.  I've always followed the 'keep my business logic decoupled' rule when I've built out applications.\n\nI'm curious what other people are doing in practice.

      "text": "Hi, I'm working on an open-source app ecosystem idea and would like some early input. There's a problem in the software world: all software is broadly divided between\n\n* a) local apps that save files on your drive as files (or database records, sometimes), or\n* b) SaaS that only persists your work to a vendor's servers.\n\nSome local apps (particularly mobile ones) look like a), but are actually b) and they nag you for a subscription fee before long.\n\n  \nClearly, having a cloud-based service where you can access your data from anywhere is beneficial for most people. On the other hand, what's not beneficial is having your data held somewhere by a company that you only marginally trust, without a real possibility of leaving.\n\nA compellingly fortunate case is where an app lets you work in the browser or natively on the desktop, but save/load your results to a selection of vendors, so that you're not tied to a particular company. This decoupling of compute/storage is rare but precious - as is the case with [draw.io](http://draw.io), a popular (open-source) diagramming tool, which I'm sure many readers are no strangers to.\n\nEven then, one cannot expect the application developer to support all imaginable vendors from all over the world, so you're left with the usual suspects: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. What if you don't really like anybody on that list? You can, of course, download the file locally and manually upload/sync it to wherever, but it seems like a less convenient and more error-prone flow, overall.\n\nNow, the general concept is this: **decouple storage** from the app itself. Get the cloud storage experience without Big G.\n\nThe candidates for this are as follows: \n\n1. WebDAV - an old protocol that's quite hard to integrate especially with browser apps\n2. Solid project - a semantic web project from Sir Tim Berners-Lee that proposes *exactly this thing* using Storage Pods, but somehow never has taken off.\n3. Automerge (from Kleppmann and friends) - CRDTs.\n4. A new thing.\n\nI'm researching these options. Lately, I've been gravitating towards option 4. WebDAV is easy to eliminate due to a non-feasible browser story, Solid is as good as dead (sad but expected, given how Semantic Web and WebID never caught on), and Automerge is as compelling as ever if it wasn't for the programming model, especially around schema migrations. CRDTs are somehow very familiar and alien at the same time.\n\nOne important piece of the puzzle is semantics. What do apps need to store? Is it **files**, or maybe **database records** in the SQL sense, or is it some abstract **resources** straight out of Roy Fielding's REST thesis? Different technologies seem to be opinionated towards different base assumptions. At this point, I'm reluctant to point to a single \"model\" that could power 100% of apps.\n\nInstead, I tried to focus on what the programmer would normally expect to have as a backend. And it turns out, an SQL database is a good starting point, but it is not the end. The overarching concept is this:\n\n**An application needs attached resources** in the infrastructural sense, some of which might be an SQL database, a filesystem, or perhaps a notification bus.\n\nA \"personal storage pod\" should make available some resources, and an application should consume them. A personal journal, planner, or To-Do list? It probably needs 1 resource: a plain old SQL database is good enough. A photo gallery app? Filesystem. A cookbook? Might be both - index in a database, food photos in the filesystem (or else you're dealing with blobs in the DB).\n\nThese things are obtainable now - anyone can subscribe to AWS S3 or a competitor and create a bucket and then point a piece of software to it. On the other hand, most people are not in IT and they would rather not manage infrastructure on AWS.\n\nThe user story is, coarsely, this:\n\n1. You sign up with a \"storage pod\" provider (or self-host one)\n2. You try using a new app, Web or traditional\n3. Instead of a typical \"Sign up for free!\" screen, you see \"connect to your pod\".\n4. You go to your pod provider and create a new Workspace.\n5. You copy the Workspace's access token (via a helpful Copy button, very UX-ish) and paste it into the new app from point 2.\n\nWhat do you think about this, in general? Cool idea? Totally unworkable?\n\n  \nSome technical minutiae which might or might not be interesting:\n\nFor the first demo, I've chosen SQLite3 as the backing database. I'm now working on a prototype where a back-end server exposes an SQLite over HTTP, authorizes access using a JSON Web Token (that's the thing the user is meant to Copy/Paste), and loads/stores it as needed. This is multi-tenant with independent lifecycles per tenant, though I'm still working on proper security and isolation.\n\nThe important point is, the database is a single file that the user owns and can download at any time. It can use a local directory or an S3 back-end with tiered persistence. At a high-level, it behaves like a \"serverless\" database (very fashionable, I've heard) - you know this because it has a cold start while it fetches the SQLite file from the archive.\n\nI haven't started work on the filesystem API yet. A major pain point is going to be the quota system - it makes sense to limit users' resource consumption in shared scenarios.\n\n(Sorry if this reads like a brain dump - that's because it is! Let me know your thoughts.)",

User loads the app, the app connects to their database, checks the version. Outdated? Yep, time to run some DDL (in a single transaction). Done. It gets a little tricky in case of concurrent access, so there might be some fencing required, but the principle still holds: the app just works on this single DB as if the user owns all of it (they do!).\n\n\nAre the pods themselves secure? Maybe. As secure as the user's cloud drive, probably, minus the factor that it's not hosted by FAANG.\n\n\nAbout data ownership: the data logically being the app's and not the user's is somehow very timely. This is just from today: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1rd60go/the_gray_box_problem_of_self_hosting/\n\n\nAnd yes, the average user will struggle to make sense of an SQLite file. On the other hand, even if they do not understand the contents, they can still move it to another provider freely or delete it. Ownership.\n\n\nAbout availability, I think that's a fair point. If the pod is down, it's like the user's hard drive was down. No saving or loading anything. On the other hand, a hosted system like this can possibly be made more available and durable than a local one (\"your laptop\"), and the ability to access the data from more than one device can help mitigate hardware failures on the client end. Of course, the network is one additional thing to fail, and there is no recourse.\n\n\nOverall, there's some trade-offs for sure. Does that make it clearer? It's fair if you still wouldn't touch it, I guess.",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m currently architecting the discovery and specification phase for a new AI-native delivery pipeline. The goal is to create \"agent-ready\" architectural artifacts that we can feed into a Git-based context warehouse. Once the architecture is locked, autonomous LLM agents read those files to generate the epics, user stories, and eventually the code itself.\n\nTo stop the AI from hallucinating system boundaries and dependencies, we’ve completely banned visual-only tools like [Draw.io](http://Draw.io) or Miro exports. Everything has to be \"machine-first\"—meaning text-to-diagram code embedded inside Markdown documents.\n\nMy current plan is to standardize on the **C4 Model** using **Mermaid.js** or **Structurizr DSL**, alongside strict **Markdown ADRs** (MADR) and **OpenAPI/AsyncAPI** for contracts. Since LLMs have a lot of training data on C4 and Mermaid, it seems like the safest bet.\n\nBut I’m wondering if we are just shoehorning a human legacy framework into an AI workflow.\n\n**My questions for the community:**\n\n1. Is there a better architectural framework or DSL emerging specifically for human-AI collaboration?\n2. Have you found any schemas (YAML/JSON/Markdown hybrids) that give LLM agents better semantic understanding of data flows and system constraints than Mermaid?\n\nWould love to hear how others are solving this \"human-to-machine\" architecture handoff!",

Structurizr allows you to create a single model (with multiple views), which LLMs have a much better time querying compared to a potentially disconnected and out-of-sync collection of Mermaid diagrams.\n\nI built a [simple MCP server for Structurizr](https://github.com/structurizr/structurizr/tree/main/structurizr-mcp), but you actually don't need it - just feed your LLM the `workspace.json` file and it has everything it needs, especially if you're embedding Markdown/AsciiDoc documentation/ADRs too.

      "text": "We standardized on GitHub three years ago and GHAS felt like the obvious choice. It lives inside the workflow, developers do not context switch, and the Copilot autofix integration is useful. For a while it was enough.\n\nThe problem surfaced when we acquired a smaller company running GitLab and inherited tooling on Azure DevOps. GHAS stops at the GitHub boundary. It has no opinion about anything outside that ecosystem. We also started feeling the DAST gap, GHAS has no dynamic scanning and the SCA depth was thinner than we needed once our dependency surface grew past a certain size.\n\nRunning Checkmarx across a mixed SCM environment is a fundamentally different conversation than asking whether GHAS is enough for a pure GitHub shop.\n\nFor teams that made this move, how disruptive was the transition?",

Checkmarx handles mixed environments but you lose the tight GitHub integration. Their ASPM correlates findings across repos regardless of SCM. Trade-off is developer convenience versus actual security coverage when your stack isn't pure GitHub anymore.",

          "text": "The SCM boundary problem is quite tricky. Checkmarx SCA does reachability analysis and supply chain risk scoring that GHAS dependency scanning doesn't touch. Also provides DAST which GitHub has no answer for. Their ASPM layer maps vulnerabilities to runtime context across all your SCMs. Platform works identically whether code lives in GitHub, GitLab, or Azure DevOps. Bigger lift than staying GitHub-native but solves the actual multi-platform problem.",
