Postgres handles way more than people think, JSON columns, full text search, pub/sub, time series data, you name it.\n\nBut there has to be a breaking point where adding more postgres features becomes worse than using purpose-built tools. When does that happen? 10k requests per second? 1 million records? 100 concurrent writers?\n\nIve seen companies scale to billions of records on postgres and Ive seen companies break at 10 million. Ive seen people using postgres as a message queue successfully and Ive seen it be a disaster.\n\nWhat determines when specialized tools become necessary? Is it always just \"when postgres becomes the bottleneck\" or are there other architectural reasons?",

If your queries require large scans of values, this works well and there are numerous partitioning schemes to pick.\n\nVertical sharding is where you partition on columns. If you are specifically querying for data in column subsets, you could just have dedicated tables for those.\n\nIt’s likely both would be helpful, and both reduce storage space. Be careful of your primary keys and indices but this is enormously effective when done right. \n\nIt isn’t too difficult to roll your own postgres orchestrator across multiple nodes. \n\nAll that said, anytime you go distributed, you have to consider HA and fault tolerance. If you are querying a subset of rows on a node that goes down you obviously won’t be getting the data unless you replicate it.\n\nIf you know your access patterns, the critical and/or most frequently accessed data can use a higher replication factor and if a node goes down just route to the replicas. The architecture of your nodes can be a tree structure where each node is a shard and the leaf nodes are the replicas. Use this to inform the load balancer and query routing.",

They validate against the organization's runway.\n\nIf you lack a mentor to review your work, you must simulate this mindset by filtering every decision through the current stage of your company.\n\n### 1. The \"Survival\" Filter (Pre-Product/Market Fit)\nIn this phase, the organization is testing hypotheses. The biggest risk isn't \"system failure\"; it's building the wrong thing efficiently.\n*   **Validation Rule:** Optimize for **Reversibility**.\n*   **The Kafka Decision:** If you ask \"Will Kafka handle the load?\", you are asking the wrong question. The right question is: \"Does the operational tax of running Kafka prevent us from pivoting next month?\"\n*   **Verdict:** Kafka is likely invalid here. It forces structural rigidity. A monolith with a simple Postgres job queue is \"valid\" because it’s easy to delete or change when the business idea fails.\n\n### 2. The \"Sales Promise\" Filter (Growth Phase)\nOnce the business has traction, validation shifts from \"Can we change it?\" to \"Can we honor the contract?\"\n*   **Validation Rule:** Optimize for **The specific promise Sales made.**\n*   **Replica vs. Caching:** Don't choose based on tech blogs. Look at the Service Level Agreement (SLA).\n    *   **Scenario A:** Sales sold a financial reporting tool. The promise is **Accuracy**. Caching is now a liability because stale data breaks the promise. You validate by proving you can scale via Read Replicas (ACID compliance).\n    *   **Scenario B:** Sales sold a social feed. The promise is **Responsiveness**. Stale data is annoying but acceptable. You validate by implementing aggressive Caching (Redis/CDN).\n\n### 3. The \"Fermi\" Filter (The Math Check)\nExperienced engineers rarely guess about load. We use **Fermi Estimation** to prove safety before writing code. This is your strongest tool against \"Imposter Syndrome.\"\n\n**The Calculation:**\nDon't worry about \"Real Production Load\" in the abstract. Calculate it.\n*   **Formula:** `Total Users` × `Daily Active %` × `Requests Per User` ÷ `Seconds in Day`.\n*   **Example:** 100k users. 10% active. 50 clicks each.\n    *   `10,000 users * 50 reqs = 500,000 reqs/day`.\n    *   `500,000 / 86,400 seconds = ~5.7 requests per second`.\n*   **The Validation:** A Raspberry Pi can handle 6 requests per second. You don't need Kubernetes; you need a single VPS. Decision validated.\n\n### 4. The \"Bus Factor\" Filter (Secret Fragility)\nYou asked: *\"Is this architecture fine or secretly fragile?\"*\n\nFragility is rarely about code breaking; it's about **Cognitive Solvency**. The \"cost\" of an architecture is the amount of human memory required to operate it.\n\n*   **The Test:** If you (the architect) are asleep or hit by a bus, can the most junior person on the team fix a critical bug at 3 AM?\n*   **The Trap:** If your \"valid\" architecture requires understanding Event Sourcing, three different message brokers, and a custom sharding layer, it is structurally insolvent for a small team.\n\n**Summary:**\nTo validate early, stop looking for \"correctness.\" Look for alignment.\n*   **Early Stage:** Valid = Reversible.\n*   **Growth Stage:** Valid = Honors the SLA.\n*   **Scale Stage:** Valid = Reduces Cognitive Load per developer.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've seen more startups die from over-engineering \"Google-scale\" solutions for zero users than from their servers melting down. Build for the problem you have right now.",

      "text": "Hi r/softwarearchitecture,\n\nStjepan from Manning here. We’ve just released a book that’s written for people who have to make architectural calls around event-driven systems and then defend those decisions over time. Mods said it's ok if I post it here:\n\n**Kafka for Architects** by Katya Gorshkova  \n[https://www.manning.com/books/designing-kafka-systems](https://hubs.la/Q041FhV20)\n\n[Kafka for Architects](https://preview.redd.it/guav3ysxachg1.jpg?width=2213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc59d0f2fef718c70d40b4996d59b6f879992605)\n\nThis isn’t a Kafka API guide or a step-by-step tutorial. It stays at the architecture level and focuses on how Kafka fits into larger systems, especially in organizations where multiple teams depend on the same infrastructure.\n\nA few of the topics the book spends real time on:\n\n* Kafka’s role in enterprise software and where it fits in an overall system design\n* Event-driven architecture as a pattern, including when it helps and when it complicates things\n* Designing data contracts and handling schema evolution across teams\n* Kafka clusters as part of the system’s operational and organizational design\n* Using Kafka for logging, telemetry, data pipelines, and microservices communication\n* Patterns and anti-patterns that tend to appear once Kafka becomes shared infrastructure\n\nWhat I appreciate about this book is that it treats Kafka as an architectural choice, not just a technology. Katya walks through trade-offs you’ll recognize if you’ve ever had to balance team autonomy, data ownership, and long-term maintainability. The examples are grounded in real-world systems, not idealized diagrams.\n\nIf you’re responsible for questions like “Is Kafka the right fit here?”, “How do we keep event contracts stable?”, or “What happens when this system grows to ten teams instead of two?”, this book is written with those concerns in mind.\n\n**For the** r/softwarearchitecture **community:**  \nYou can get **50% off** with the code **PBGORSHKOVA50RE**.\n\nIf you’re already using Kafka as part of a larger system, I’d be interested to hear what architectural challenges you’re currently dealing with.\n\nThanks for having us. It feels great to be here.\n\nCheers,\n\nStjepan",

As per another comment, it's just a way of moving data around.\n\nEvent sourcing is when your actual source of truth is a list of events rather than a traditional relational model, and the only way to reason about the current state of your data is to replay those events and aggregate them into a meaningful model (which is usually snapshotted at regularly intervals to save you having to replay every event from the start of time just to run simple queries against your data). It's inspired by accounting ledgers, and typically paired with CQRS, which means different consumers of your events can do their own aggregation and maintain their own \"projections\".\n\nIn its most purist form, this is often not a great fit for a lot of problem spaces, so a lot of real-world systems are built on hybrid architectures instead, meaning they adopt parts of event sourcing, but the system of record remains a traditional database.",

      "text": "I'm finally giving in and trying a stricter approach to architecting larger systems. I've read a bunch about domains and onions, still getting familiar with the stuff. I like the loose coupling it provides, but managing the interfaces and keeping the structures consistent sounds like a pain.\n\nSo I started working on a UI tool with a codegen service that can generate the skeletons for all the ports, and services, domain entities and adapters. It'll also keep services and interfaces in sync based on direct code changes as well. I also want to provide a nice context map to show which contexts rely on other contexts. It'll try to enforce the basic rules of what structural elements can use, implement or inject others. I'll probably have a CLI interface that complements the UI which could be used in pipelines as well to validate those basic rules. The code will remain mostly directly editable. I'm aiming to do this for Python at first, but it doesn't seem too complicated to extend to other languages.\n\nThoughts about the usefulness of such a tool or clean code / DDD in general?",

I'd love the opinions of others here on this. \n\nMy take is that these tools encode not just a particular style, but define a framework by the nature of how they work. If you want to do anything, you have to do it in a particular way.\n\nSo these \"tools\" \"become\" \"frameworks\". \n\nWhat's a framework? I'd say it's an enforced collection of patterns. (which is what you'll do - you'll select a finite set of patterns that this tool will realize)\n\nBut what's a pattern? Why do we use patterns? I'd say, we use patterns to work around the shortcomings of some environment. It's a way of dealing with reality so we can achieve the outcomes we need. \n\nThe problem is that any finite selection of patterns can only cover a subset of the continuum of implementations required for our business cases. To deal with this, developers sometimes come up with new patterns to deal with the canonical way of doing things. Sometimes that works out fine. Sometimes it doesn't make sense at all.\n\nAs languages and environments and patterns evolve, it sometimes stops making sense to bend over backwards to appease the framework, and working outside of the framework becomes easier. At some point the frameworks becomes either so sidelined or adapted and specialized so it stops being the universal panacea it was supposed to be.\n\nAnd then someone invents a new framework to supplant all these specializations, and the cycle begins anew \n\n# 🤔\n\n---\n\n> I've been told a bunch of times that this kind of architecture isn't worth it, or it's too academic and overcomplicated. So I'm really giving into my own desires to see how it works for me\n\nI think that's good. There's a nugget of truth in everything, and if you have the energy and time and will to prospect for that bit of truth, that's perfect. That's probably the best way to become a good architect, especially if no one else has to suffer from your exploratory decisions lol.",

It is a pain because it is a pain. The fact that you're considering code generation is sort of a red flag and generating skeletons won't help when you get hit with a 3k lines PR for what would otherwise be a much simpler change. IMO people should stop this indiscriminate layering nonsense and focus on actual abstractions and designing actual robust APIs (when possible and needed, otherwise it's perfectly fine to write code in a direct style). I'm allowing for indirection where there are particular pain points and people stepping too much on each other's toes, but you need to be conservative about it.",

                  "text": "For example, compilers often have IRs (intermediate representations) that are carefully considered to allow translation of the code as well as optimizations (which might require combining knowledge of different languages or different CPUs without ending up with a combinatorial explosion of corner cases, some of those pseudoinstructions might not even resemble any concrete instruction). A database may provide a set of primitive operations that are enough to write applications within a certain consistency model and with certain transactional capabilities, possibly with a higher-level / convenience API on to make it easier for simple use cases. A compression library provides APIs that are generally robust for a wide variety of use cases so you don't need to go make changes to it to use it in your own application (and they're not changing the API surface all the time). An operating system kernel needs to provide a driver model such that a diverse set of hardware devices can be managed (some only require initialization, some require to be notified before being powered-down and so on). A JSON parser might provide both streaming and non-streaming parsers (building the entire representation in memory upfront) in a convenient way and for a wide variety of users. All these tend to require rather careful consideration.\n\nIn contrast and at least in a practical sense, stuff related to layered architectures often tends to be applied blindly and as a general recipe, being little more than arbitrary scaffolding. This tends to be compounded by people trying to split work top-down in a trivial way. It's easy to say \"hey, someone should do auth and someone should do the books endpoint\". But then the auth stuff could just be one or two calls into the framework / auth library and it's instead blown to an entire component that barely adds anything (and might even impose needless restrictions). In such cases nobody's really doing any real work of abstracting stuff, they're just writing wrappers for straightforward calls.\n\nSupposedly this sometimes protects against changing requirements but I find that's usually not true, it's just a place where you end up putting ugly hacks that would have been better fixed by large-scale refactoring. It reduces visibility into code and changes because everything is 7 useless layers deep. It makes it \"easy\" to write 100k LOC of code that barely does anything concrete. It makes it hard to write composable helpers because everything is encapsulated too tightly yet it's not robust enough to handle all reasonable use cases. And to some degree it shouldn't be, that's what the framework is for, while you're writing a very specific and concrete application.\n\nOn a somewhat related note, I think a good and even simpler test for code writing ability is to look at how people write functions/methods. Do they split them wisely? One could do either of (1) one big function or (2) a hundred very small functions that presume a bunch of invariants (\"I'm always being passed a non-empty array of at most 3 elements, I'll crash otherwise\"). Those are both pretty poor choices, usually. Or they can be mindful about stuff and split on natural boundaries and where there's least resistance, for example by making a helper that compares JSON objects a certain way and makes at least some sense on its own (either for DRY purposes or simply because it's clearer / more testable on its own). This kind of soft separation is very useful, because you're grouping things logically, making them easier to write / review / confirm they're working, while also allowing the possibility of refactoring at will. But it's not something that's just a recipe and it heavily depends on experience and what the code really does.\n\nThat being said, some layering may be fine, though. It's just that you have to be conservative about it because it has a cost. And it's often overused.",

If you read about modular design, you gonna see there's no \"contract layer\" (you asked for modular design, not layered architecture after all). \n\nIn practice, in lean design (as opposite to enterprise designs), there are two common cases are:\n\n1. Module A delegates its infrastructure code to Module A'. In such case module A defines all the interfaces, and module A' implements them. Example: \"DeviceRegistration\" and \"DeviceRegistration - Infrastructure\" modules. This way \"DeviceRegistration\" has no infra code and doesn't depend on the \"DeviceRegistration - Infrastructure\".\n\n2. Module A needs to delegate flow to Module B. In such case there is a direct dependency, and no amount of tricks with separate abstraction layer won't change it. Put the interfaces in the upstream module, and let downstream module implement them. It the flow is unidirectional, direct dependency between modules, where you invoke classes of the mobule B is fine. It could be as easy as exposing a Facade Pattern. \n\nI was many Java or C# implementations with many abstraction layers, but I think that in the end it's Go that nailed it. It's even built-in into its philosophy by \"consumers to define interfaces instead of producers\" mantra.",

          "text": "Your question is correct, you are overcomplicating it.\n\nBehaviors, functions, and requirements are not sequential steps but viewpoints of the same thing.\n\nIn software, we create systems that are n-dimensional in nature. It is a simple structure of logical components, but behavior and requirements (among many other things) are all constructs humans layer on top of the logical components to make sense of it all. It exists detached and purely for our benefit, so that we may design more elegant software systems. The software itself doesn't benefit from behavior analysis or architectural fitness or performance... It just *does*. Same as with Systems Engineering.\n\nSo, separating the real from the imagined we can see that the behavior of a system is one viewpoint we would design. The requirements is another synonym of behavior, but a subset of behaviors that is strictly required. Non-functional requirements are still required, just harder for stakeholders to articulate. Things that if catastrophe arrived, the stakeholders would say 'of course I want that!' Do they want it reasonably performant? Do they want it to be observed so errors are clear and remedies quickly? Do they want failover in case a data center goes out?\n\nAll that to say, your perception of a sequential flow of designing a software intensive system is incorrect.\n\n1) Start with functional requirements\n2) Add non-functional requirements\n3) Identify True Constraints (versus imagined constraints)\n4) Decide what to optimize for, in pursuit of the larger goal\n5) Use comfortable tools & techniques to design your system\n6) Use the previous 5 steps as a guide to redesign what you just made, but to be easily manufactured (coded, released, maintained, and deprecated)",
