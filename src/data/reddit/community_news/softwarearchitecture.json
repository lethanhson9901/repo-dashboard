      "text": "We ran into something recently that made me rethink a system design decision while working on an event-driven architecture. We have multiple Kafka topics and worker services chained together, a kind of mini workflow.\n\n[Mini Workflow](https://preview.redd.it/fgm3nejx93hg1.png?width=3750&format=png&auto=webp&s=7965432a4731f2658c648475b1d90593a0f69282)\n\nThe entry point is a legacy system. It reads data from an integration database, builds a JSON file, and publishes the entire file directly into the first Kafka topic.\n\n# The problem\n\nOne day, some of those JSON files started exceeding Kafka’s default message size limit. Our first reaction was to ask the DevOps team to increase the Kafka size limit. It worked, but it felt similar to increasing a database connection pool size.\n\nThen one of the JSON files kept growing. At that point, the DevOps team pushed back on increasing the Kafka size limit any further, so the team decided to implement chunking logic inside the legacy system itself, splitting the file before sending it into Kafka.\n\nThat worked too, but now we had custom batching/chunking logic affecting the stability of an existing working system.\n\n# The solution\n\nWhile looking into system design patterns, I came across the Claim-Check pattern.\n\n[Claim-Check Pattern](https://preview.redd.it/3lmiy1t9a3hg1.png?width=3332&format=png&auto=webp&s=890aa3c5d542d979c9e7eb0d564dcfa576aa9276)\n\nInstead of batching inside the legacy system, the idea is to store the large payload in external storage, send only a small message with a reference, and let consumers fetch the payload only when they actually need it.\n\n# The realization\n\nWhat surprised me was realizing that simply looking into existing system design patterns could have saved us a lot of time building all of this.\n\nIt’s a good reminder to pause and check those patterns when making system design decisions, instead of immediately implementing the first idea that comes to mind.",

All those other information you should get on your own from database or other storage when you think it's necessary.\n\nIn real time system you usually want to have each message under ~1.4kb this is the frame size in which your messages are send over the network.\n\nBecause if you need to pass larger messages you will need wait for the all other frames that together create single message.\n\nThis way if you send only 1 frame you can go crazy fast.\n\nAlso Kafka uses stores messages to be replied when necessary, you will be able to store more messages.\n\nYou also may want to think about private replies of messages. For example you have service that receives http request, you send event and await other in response. You need to know how to send a response event to the instance of app that holds http socket file to be able to respond to the http request with the event data.\n\nIt's a bit more advanced but it is what many event driven systems need.",

The same applies to telemetry data in fleet management.\n\nClaim Check has its merits, as you mentioned, but it also has downsides.

This has been around for a long time and continues to get better. Fully generating your posts will result in removal, repeat offenders will be banned. I'm open to pinning a post that has a list of good alternatives if we can crowdsource it from experience.\n\nThank you to everyone who voted in the poll!

As you might run out of number of connections with enough number of clients which can effectively bring down whole DB.\n\nCaching high volume , short lived data? Probably also not a great idea. As the number of inserted but not vacuumed rows will take huge space and likely to effect overall performance.\n\nIf your work loads aren't heavily based on such cases?

Instead, there are many hard parts--difficult problems or issues with no best practices--that force you to choose among various compromises. With this book, you'll learn how to think critically about the trade-offs involved with distributed architectures. Architecture veterans and practicing consultants Neal Ford, Mark Richards, Pramod Sadalage, and Zhamak Dehghani discuss strategies for choosing an appropriate architecture.\n>\n>By interweaving a story about a fictional group of technology professionals--the Sysops Squad--they examine everything from how to determine service granularity, manage workflows and orchestration, manage and decouple contracts, and manage distributed transactions to how to optimize operational characteristics, such as scalability, elasticity, and performance. By focusing on commonly asked questions, this book provides techniques to help you discover and weigh the trade-offs as you confront the issues you face as an architect. Analyze trade-offs and effectively document your decisions Make better decisions regarding service granularity Understand the complexities of breaking apart monolithic applications Manage and decouple contracts between services Handle data in a highly distributed architecture Learn patterns to manage workflow and transactions when breaking apart applications\n\n\n*I'm a bot, built by your friendly reddit developers at* /r/ProgrammingPals. *Reply to any comment with /u/BookFinderBot - I'll reply with book information.

Martin (“Uncle Bob”) By applying universal rules of software architecture, you can dramatically improve developer productivity throughout the life of any software system. Now, building upon the success of his best-selling books Clean Code and The Clean Coder, legendary software craftsman Robert C. Martin (“Uncle Bob”) reveals those rules and helps you apply them. Martin’s Clean Architecture doesn’t merely present options. Drawing on over a half-century of experience in software environments of every imaginable type, Martin tells you what choices to make and why they are critical to your success.\n>\n>As you’ve come to expect from Uncle Bob, this book is packed with direct, no-nonsense solutions for the real challenges you’ll face–the ones that will make or break your projects. Learn what software architects need to achieve–and core disciplines and practices for achieving it Master essential software design principles for addressing function, component separation, and data management See how programming paradigms impose discipline by restricting what developers can do Understand what’s critically important and what’s merely a “detail” Implement optimal, high-level structures for web, database, thick-client, console, and embedded applications Define appropriate boundaries and layers, and organize components and services See why designs and architectures go wrong, and how to prevent (or fix) these failures Clean Architecture is essential reading for every current or aspiring software architect, systems analyst, system designer, and software manager–and for every programmer who must execute someone else’s designs.

Not only we have to chase ever-changing technological trends, but we also have to grasp business domains that we are building the software for. The latter is often overseen, and it explains why so many projects are doomed to fail. After all, how can you build a solution if you don't understand the problem?\n>\n>Through this book, you will learn the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) methodology which provides a set of core patterns, principles, and practices for analyzing business domains, understanding business strategy, and, most importantly, aligning software design with its business needs. These include Ubiquitous Language, Bounded Contexts, Event Storming, and others. You will see how these practices not only lead to robust implementation of business logic, but also to future-proof software design and architecture. You will also learn the relationship between DDD and other methodologies to ensure that you are able to make architectural decisions that will meet the business needs.\n>\n>The final section puts all of this into practice using a real life story of implementing Domain-Driven Design in a startup company. Reading the book will allow you to use DDD for analyzing business domains, aligning software and business strategies, and making socio-technical design decisions. By the end of this book, you will be able to:-Build a shared understanding of a business domain-Analyze a company's business domain and competitive strategy-Decompose a system into bounded contexts-Coordinate the work of multiple teams working together-Gradually start implementing domain-driven design\n\n\n*I'm a bot, built by your friendly reddit developers at* /r/ProgrammingPals. *Reply to any comment with /u/BookFinderBot - I'll reply with book information.

It avoids the one-size-fits all process tarp pit with advice on how to tune your design effort based on the risks you face. This book seeks to make architecture relevant to all software developers. Developers need to understand how to use constraints as guiderails that ensure desired outcomes.\n>\n>This book focuses on the technical parts of software development and what developers do to ensure the system works-not the job titles or processes. It shows you how to build models and analyze architectures so that you can make principled design tradeoffs. It describes the techniques software designers use to reason about medium to large sized problems and points out where you learn specialized techniques in more detail. The approach in this book embraces drill-down/pop-up behavior by describing models that have various levels of abstraction, from architecture to data structure design.\n\n\n**Fundamentals of Software Architecture An Engineering Approach** by Mark Richards, Neal Ford\n\n\n>Salary surveys worldwide regularly place software architect in the top 10 best jobs, yet no real guide exists to help developers become architects.

      "text": "Hi r/softwarearchitecture,\n\nStjepan from Manning here. We’ve just released a book that’s written for people who have to make architectural calls around event-driven systems and then defend those decisions over time. Mods said it's ok if I post it here:\n\n**Kafka for Architects** by Katya Gorshkova  \n[https://www.manning.com/books/designing-kafka-systems](https://hubs.la/Q041FhV20)\n\n[Kafka for Architects](https://preview.redd.it/guav3ysxachg1.jpg?width=2213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc59d0f2fef718c70d40b4996d59b6f879992605)\n\nThis isn’t a Kafka API guide or a step-by-step tutorial. It stays at the architecture level and focuses on how Kafka fits into larger systems, especially in organizations where multiple teams depend on the same infrastructure.\n\nA few of the topics the book spends real time on:\n\n* Kafka’s role in enterprise software and where it fits in an overall system design\n* Event-driven architecture as a pattern, including when it helps and when it complicates things\n* Designing data contracts and handling schema evolution across teams\n* Kafka clusters as part of the system’s operational and organizational design\n* Using Kafka for logging, telemetry, data pipelines, and microservices communication\n* Patterns and anti-patterns that tend to appear once Kafka becomes shared infrastructure\n\nWhat I appreciate about this book is that it treats Kafka as an architectural choice, not just a technology. Katya walks through trade-offs you’ll recognize if you’ve ever had to balance team autonomy, data ownership, and long-term maintainability. The examples are grounded in real-world systems, not idealized diagrams.\n\nIf you’re responsible for questions like “Is Kafka the right fit here?”, “How do we keep event contracts stable?”, or “What happens when this system grows to ten teams instead of two?”, this book is written with those concerns in mind.\n\n**For the** r/softwarearchitecture **community:**  \nYou can get **50% off** with the code **PBGORSHKOVA50RE**.\n\nIf you’re already using Kafka as part of a larger system, I’d be interested to hear what architectural challenges you’re currently dealing with.\n\nThanks for having us. It feels great to be here.\n\nCheers,\n\nStjepan",

          "text": "Just a comment from someone who dislikes it. I hope we're talking about the same thing, though, because I'm not really sure...\n\nI don't think that's the real reason. One thing might be horizontal dev scaling: plenty of businesses barely build upon anything, it's an endless crunch to appease one customer, then the next and so on. Architecture is simply an attempt to install guardrails so they can hire en masse with low costs and divide up work. Something a very average dev (mediocre even) can handle, because you want lots of them. Another thing is the expectation that software is write-once, especially when they accumulate tons of half-baked features and tech debt that's difficult to repay, they try to extract as much as possible (and impossible).\n\nIn a nutshell, it's trying to scale up work as cheaply as possible, because ultimately a lot of business is just trying to get money to work. As for where and whether it goes wrong objectively, this is also debatable. I would say the main issues are (1) unrealistic expectations and (2) they're missing out on higher impact, more efficient software development that really taps into the potential of this domain (but you need a strong vision for this, it's not just a matter of spending).\n\nIn practical terms, you'll see silos, you'll see layers upon layers that give the impression that everything is decoupled (yet it isn't, the spaghetti is on another level), you'll see work getting split in ways that makes absolutely no sense and results in huge amounts of duplication. Do reduced hiring costs make up for this? Maybe, although I doubt it can beat a small team of people with enough expertise cutting through the bullshit and working under a well-determined, restricted scope. Scope creep and tech debt tends to balloon up costs, so even if it looks like you can satisfy hundreds of customers early on, things eventually slow down greatly and you have to keep adding to the headcount and reducing margins. Until the costs become insane and the project gets sunset (often quite early).",

When making designs in such cases, it's important to be mindful that at some point this would change, because the other way around increases cost i.e on operations. Hence the designs go into series of discussions which tradeoff to choose, and enterprise architecture essentially helps making these decisions as it allows to estimate the cost for the current project and the cost of changing it in the future. Comparing this to projections of other cost like cost of running operations or other non functionals help making smart business decisions.\n\nAs cost of change needs to be minimized and eventually management will come to their senses, enterprise architecture is sadly required for technical people to cope with ever changing nature of business demands.",

If you read about modular design, you gonna see there's no \"contract layer\" (you asked for modular design, not layered architecture after all). \n\nIn practice, in lean design (as opposite to enterprise designs), there are two common cases are:\n\n1. Module A delegates its infrastructure code to Module A'. In such case module A defines all the interfaces, and module A' implements them. Example: \"DeviceRegistration\" and \"DeviceRegistration - Infrastructure\" modules. This way \"DeviceRegistration\" has no infra code and doesn't depend on the \"DeviceRegistration - Infrastructure\".\n\n2. Module A needs to delegate flow to Module B. In such case there is a direct dependency, and no amount of tricks with separate abstraction layer won't change it. Put the interfaces in the upstream module, and let downstream module implement them. It the flow is unidirectional, direct dependency between modules, where you invoke classes of the mobule B is fine. It could be as easy as exposing a Facade Pattern. \n\nI was many Java or C# implementations with many abstraction layers, but I think that in the end it's Go that nailed it. It's even built-in into its philosophy by \"consumers to define interfaces instead of producers\" mantra.",

      "text": "I have to design a flow for a new requirement. Our product code base is quite huge and the initial architects have made sure that no one has to write data intensive code themselves. They have pre-written frameworks/utilities for most of the things. \n\nBasically, we hardly get to design any such thing ourselves hence I lack much experience of it and my post might seem naive so please excuse me for it.\n\n(EDITED) The requirement was that we will be using RabbitMQ so the user request to service A will send a message to the queue and there will be a consumer service B which would use Apache Camel, would go through routes (I mean so it's already asynchronous) to finally requesting records from the join of tables. (Just a simple inner join, nothing complex) Those records might or might not need processing and have to be written to a multipart file of type csv, which would be sent to another API to another service C.\n\nWe're using PostgreSQL. I've figured out the Camel routing part (again using existing utilities). Designed a sort of LLD. Now the real question was fetching records and writing to csv without running into OOM issue. It seems to be the main focus of my technical architect.\n\nI've decided on using - (EDITED)\n\nJdbcTemplate.query using RowCallBackHandler\n\n(Might use JdbcTemplate.queryForStream(...), since I'm on Java 17 so better to use streams rather than RowCallBackHandler, but there are other factors like connection stays open, fetchSize on individual statement isn't possible)\n\nWould be using a setFetchSize(500) - Might change the value depending on the tradeoffs as per further discussions.\n\nMight use setMaxRows as well.\n\nThe query would be time period based so can add that time duration in the query itself.\n\nThen I'll be using CSVPrinter/BufferWriter/OutputStream to write it to the Multipart file (which is in memory not on disk). [Not so clear on this, still figuring out]\n\nEDIT - \nSo, service C is one of the microservice which would eventually store the file as zip in a table. DB processing can be done in chunks but still file would be in memory. So have decided to stream write to a temporary file on disk, then stream read it and stream write to a compressed zip and then send it to service C. I'm currently doing a POC of this approach if that's even possible or not.\n\n\nThis is just a discussion. I need suggestions regarding how I can use JdbcTemplate, CSVPrinter, Streams better.\n\n\nI know it's nothing complex but I want to do it right. I used to work on a C# project (shit project) for 4.5 yrs and moved to Java, 2 yrs back. Roast me but help me get better please. Thank you. ",

Help me to understand:\n\n-Why rabbit?it means that the  process that read the file (call it the producer) is not on the same software/machine/system of the one that read them? ( Call it the consumer). So producer read from your db, write messages in rabbit and a different system will read and build the csv?\n\n- camel is not enough to be \"automatically async\" because of routes. A route can be fully sync, and to be honest in most case you want to be sync ( for example if you are dealing with transactions). The async is because of Rabbit,and it's async between producer and consumer still the consumer part might or might not be sync with the thread that read from rabbit.\n\n- if messages goes from postgeres to the CVS producer via rabbit,the advance of using streamed query highly depends on how you write on rabbit.do you send rows in bulk ( 10,100,1000s each rabbit message) or one message each row ( very poor performance wise)?\n\n- by the way if performance is a concerns,don't use text formats for rabbit messages (Jason,XML ) goes for a binary serialization library.\n\n- what is a multiparty csv? There are csv payload and multipart http requests. Multipart csv look new to me.\n\nClarify these please and we can continue...\n\nEdit: and most important how \"big\" is big here? Thousands of records?millions? billions? A 10MB csv, 100 MB? GB?",

If you want to keep a minimum of streaming features you probably want to use chunked data (if http 1) or DATA frames (if http/2) but you need to be sure that both your http client and API server are able to manage them (which should be..but check to be sure).\n\nIf not, you have to send the CVS file all in once,that means load in memory all at once. Or you might want to save it on some third party storage and send link to the external API to retrieve if it too big.\n\nConsidering you can actually send data in streaming fashion, I think I would go for paginate the query on db assign each page to a different thread, read and process In parallel (you may want to track some row key or page number to reorder data at the end),and then compose and reorder it need. With camel should be matter of a couple of stages to accomplish that, patterns of scatter and recompose is well supported.\n\nThen you can buffer your rows,once processed and reordered and send them when ready again in chunk,or data as said before.\n\nBut keep in mind,if you need  any summarized data (like the average of some value,thing like that )you cannot avoid to load  everything in memory at least once.\n\nI would keep thing parametric like:\n\n- records in a page \n- number of thread for reading\n -dimension of chunk\n- dimension of http post body buffer\n\nAnd play a bit to see what fit best. Speed and Memory and resources are always connected,high speed, more parallelism,more memory and more resources but faster.\n\nLess parellism,or smaller db pages,will consume less resources but requires more time to complete..you need to try and tweak.\n\nIdeally if you want to stream directly from db to API,you cannot use more that one thread for db page (no parallelism, one page at time, out of db through API sync)\n\nThe more parallel thread you will use the more memory you need because worst case, to build an ordered chunk you might need to keep in Memory all the required pages until you fill the write buffer. I.e. you spin 3 thread and read page 1,2,3 but thread 3 finish first. To send all the records ordered you need to wait for thread 1 an 2 to complete, so worst case you need all 3 Db pages to be loaded in memory for reordering.\n\nso keep main parameters variables using external properties ( possibly with hot reload or JMX access to change them while running) and find your sweet spot.",

I like the loose coupling it provides, but managing the interfaces and keeping the structures consistent sounds like a pain.\n\nSo I started working on a UI tool with a codegen service that can generate the skeletons for all the ports, and services, domain entities and adapters. It'll also keep services and interfaces in sync based on direct code changes as well. I also want to provide a nice context map to show which contexts rely on other contexts. It'll try to enforce the basic rules of what structural elements can use, implement or inject others. I'll probably have a CLI interface that complements the UI which could be used in pipelines as well to validate those basic rules. The code will remain mostly directly editable.

I'd love the opinions of others here on this. \n\nMy take is that these tools encode not just a particular style, but define a framework by the nature of how they work. If you want to do anything, you have to do it in a particular way.\n\nSo these \"tools\" \"become\" \"frameworks\". \n\nWhat's a framework? I'd say it's an enforced collection of patterns. (which is what you'll do - you'll select a finite set of patterns that this tool will realize)\n\nBut what's a pattern? Why do we use patterns? I'd say, we use patterns to work around the shortcomings of some environment. It's a way of dealing with reality so we can achieve the outcomes we need. \n\nThe problem is that any finite selection of patterns can only cover a subset of the continuum of implementations required for our business cases. To deal with this, developers sometimes come up with new patterns to deal with the canonical way of doing things. Sometimes that works out fine. Sometimes it doesn't make sense at all.\n\nAs languages and environments and patterns evolve, it sometimes stops making sense to bend over backwards to appease the framework, and working outside of the framework becomes easier. At some point the frameworks becomes either so sidelined or adapted and specialized so it stops being the universal panacea it was supposed to be.\n\nAnd then someone invents a new framework to supplant all these specializations, and the cycle begins anew \n\n# 🤔\n\n---\n\n> I've been told a bunch of times that this kind of architecture isn't worth it, or it's too academic and overcomplicated.

There's a nugget of truth in everything, and if you have the energy and time and will to prospect for that bit of truth, that's perfect.

You mention focusing on actual abstractions and robust APIs. Do you think the clean architecture with dependency inversion, ports, services, adapters, etc... is on the other end of things? If so could you elaborate on what kind of abstractions/patterns you have in mind?",

                  "text": "For example, compilers often have IRs (intermediate representations) that are carefully considered to allow translation of the code as well as optimizations (which might require combining knowledge of different languages or different CPUs without ending up with a combinatorial explosion of corner cases, some of those pseudoinstructions might not even resemble any concrete instruction). A database may provide a set of primitive operations that are enough to write applications within a certain consistency model and with certain transactional capabilities, possibly with a higher-level / convenience API on to make it easier for simple use cases. A compression library provides APIs that are generally robust for a wide variety of use cases so you don't need to go make changes to it to use it in your own application (and they're not changing the API surface all the time). An operating system kernel needs to provide a driver model such that a diverse set of hardware devices can be managed (some only require initialization, some require to be notified before being powered-down and so on). A JSON parser might provide both streaming and non-streaming parsers (building the entire representation in memory upfront) in a convenient way and for a wide variety of users. All these tend to require rather careful consideration.\n\nIn contrast and at least in a practical sense, stuff related to layered architectures often tends to be applied blindly and as a general recipe, being little more than arbitrary scaffolding. This tends to be compounded by people trying to split work top-down in a trivial way. It's easy to say \"hey, someone should do auth and someone should do the books endpoint\". But then the auth stuff could just be one or two calls into the framework / auth library and it's instead blown to an entire component that barely adds anything (and might even impose needless restrictions). In such cases nobody's really doing any real work of abstracting stuff, they're just writing wrappers for straightforward calls.\n\nSupposedly this sometimes protects against changing requirements but I find that's usually not true, it's just a place where you end up putting ugly hacks that would have been better fixed by large-scale refactoring. It reduces visibility into code and changes because everything is 7 useless layers deep. It makes it \"easy\" to write 100k LOC of code that barely does anything concrete. It makes it hard to write composable helpers because everything is encapsulated too tightly yet it's not robust enough to handle all reasonable use cases. And to some degree it shouldn't be, that's what the framework is for, while you're writing a very specific and concrete application.\n\nOn a somewhat related note, I think a good and even simpler test for code writing ability is to look at how people write functions/methods. Do they split them wisely? One could do either of (1) one big function or (2) a hundred very small functions that presume a bunch of invariants (\"I'm always being passed a non-empty array of at most 3 elements, I'll crash otherwise\"). Those are both pretty poor choices, usually. Or they can be mindful about stuff and split on natural boundaries and where there's least resistance, for example by making a helper that compares JSON objects a certain way and makes at least some sense on its own (either for DRY purposes or simply because it's clearer / more testable on its own). This kind of soft separation is very useful, because you're grouping things logically, making them easier to write / review / confirm they're working, while also allowing the possibility of refactoring at will. But it's not something that's just a recipe and it heavily depends on experience and what the code really does.\n\nThat being said, some layering may be fine, though. It's just that you have to be conservative about it because it has a cost. And it's often overused.",

Should Elasticsearch indices be created manually (DevOps/Kibana/Terraform), or should the application be responsible for creating them at runtime , or is there's something like db migrations but for ES ?\n\nQ2. If Elasticsearch indices are managed outside the application, how should the app safely depend on them without crashing if an index is missing or renamed? For example, is it okay to just return an empty list when Elasticsearch responds with an error?\n\nQ3. Without migrations like SQL, how are index mapping changes managed over time?  \n\n\nQ4. Should the application be responsible for pushing data into Elasticsearch when DB data changes, or should this be handled externally via CDC (e.g., Debezium) or am I over engineering ?\n\n",
