Fine. He did hack stuff. Cool.\nBut here’s where everything goes full WTF levels unknown to mankind:\n\nA federal judge was convinced genuinely, unironically convinced that Kevin could “start a nuclear war by whistling into a phone.”\n\nLet me repeat that:\nA man was thrown in solitary confinement because someone thought he could blow up the world using dial-up noises.\nThis wasn’t satire.\nThis was the United States justice system.\nThey literally banned him from:\nUsing a phone\nTouching a computer\nBeing near anything with “tones”\nAnd kept him in solitary like he was a human rootkit about to self-replicate\nAll because they believed he was some kind of mythical techno-wizard who could whistle binary like a Final Boss NPC.\n\nMeanwhile, actual cybersecurity experts were like:\n\n“Uh… that’s not… how anything works.”\nAnd the court was like:\n“Shhhhh. He’s dangerous. He knows… computers.”\n\nThe whole thing became one of the biggest controversies in cybercrime history because it showed just how hilariously clueless the system was about technology.\n\nImagine going to prison because a judge thinks you might be able to hack NORAD with your mouth.\n",

At the time, the Defense Nuclear Agency access nodes were wide open, so you didn't need to whistle; you just social-engineered a login. \n\nDirect attacks weren't Mitnick's style; he usually collaborated with his partner, Roscoe, to physically penetrate a facility for intelligence and later used that information to hack it. \n\nAny sufficiently advanced methodology seems like magic, I guess.

Governance easily overreaches here.  \nWe had to learn to “pick our battles” and leave teams freedom internally to keep speed and ownership high.\n\nIf I were to start again, I would probably look into Architecture as Code earlier. I personally don’t have strong tool recommendations yet, so for us it always came down to a cost/benefit trade-off: documentation in Confluence vs. technical enforcement via tooling.\n\nWhat helped us a lot in the beginning were guild / community structures. They gave us a natural place to grow standards and patterns together with the people actually doing the work. Our experience was that governance has to be built with the teams, otherwise commitment stays shallow.\n\nOne more thing we learned:  \nSomeone needs to clearly own moderation and final decisions. Without a visible decision owner, we never really converged on a shared strategy.",

I would start with a small, accepted core of architects in the middle, give them a clear mandate to moderate and decide, and grow from there.\n\nEven a lightweight governance setup already helps:\n\n\\- to avoid building new technical debt\n\n\\- to even make technical debt visible and understandable in the first place\n\n\\- to create clarity in decisions\n\n\\- in the long run to make everyone who touches architecture stronger\n\n  \nGood luck!",

Requirements are good enough to begin, but not really complete, and then they keep evolving while implementation is already in progress. Late in the process, someone suddenly realizes there’s a missing dependency - a contract, an external system, some approval that wasn’t accounted for upfront. \n\nAt the same time, different phases blur together. Analysis isn’t really finished, but coding begins because of deadlines. Development isn’t fully reviewed yet, but testing has already started. Releases get planned while there are still known open risks. \n\nThere doesn’t seem to be a clear point where everyone agrees: “this is the current truth we’re working against.” \n\nWhat I’m trying to understand is how teams that work well avoid this turning into constant rework and frustration. Do you rely on explicit handoffs or contracts between roles, or some kind of commitment point before starting implementation? \n\nHow do you handle changes once work is already underway without everything becoming reactive?

          "text": "When you start a new project, the most important thing is to prioritize work on the **core** functionality.\n\n other words, don't try to choose the requirements you want to target and treat them as stable, no, that's the wrong way around. Instead, try to choose the most stable requirements, and cut, cut, cut the list down to the absolute, bare bones minimum. This is known as defining the MIP, the minimum implementable product.\n\nFor example, if you are a bank, you have customers and those customers have certain characteristics in your system: a name, an address, a username, a DOB, etc. They have that stuff today, they will have that stuff tomorrow, and they will have that stuff 50 years from now. These customers have checking and savings accounts. Those are products your bank offers today, tomorrow, and will likely offer 50 years from now. Etc.\n\nBuild the most stable and durable stuff first. The most stable aspects of a system are also the things that are the most solid foundation for your system. IOW, these things can support lots of incoming dependency. Conversely, you should be careful to not build dependency in the other direction, where highly stable things depend upon things you add later which are not so stable over time. Also, you should make sure the most stable and depended-upon elements of your system are the most *dependable*—that is, they are the most well-tested, documented, etc.\n\nThe only way this can go wrong is if your org decides they want to be a completely different business. If you are a bank and you build a bunch of bank stuff and then the board of directors says, hey, we decided we're going to be a movie theater company instead, you're kind of screwed.\n\nAnother milestone of such a project is the MVP, the minimum viable product. This is the most stripped-down version of your system that actually does something useful for customers. This, again, should be defined by cutting requirements down as much as possible, meaning that it may only be useful to your friendliest alpha customers, whom you've reached out to and gotten on board to be early adopters willing to use and give feedback on your limited alpha release.\n\nWhen you first sit down to design your new project, you start by blue skying all of the cool stuff you want it to eventually do, then you ruthlessly cut it down to the smallest possible thing you can implement, then on top of that highly stable, highly dependable backbone you implement the requirements that is the smallest possible thing you can roll out to actual customers, and you do that.\n\nThe next step from here is to start adding requirements that will bring in the largest number of additional customers for the least amount of effort. If you add a few more reqs, maybe you can add another 10% of your customer base to your alpha. Great, do that. This is how you continue building milestones until you have a beta that serves 75‒90% of your customer base. Once you've run the beta with a significant customer base long enough to know it's stable, you start migrating customers to the beta and stress test it, it passes, you bring it out of beta, and then at some point you EOL the existing product and force-migrate your customers to the new thing. Along the way you will undoubtedly find that the long tail of customers you were supporting before will never migrate because you can't meet their requirements, and they're just not worth it unless those are on your roadmap somehow anyway.\n\nYour approach to this in your questions isn't quite right:\n\n>In many Agile setups, it feels like work starts before things are truly nailed down. Requirements are good enough to begin, but not really complete, and then they keep evolving while implementation is already in progress.\n\nWhen you say \"requirements\" you are not being specific enough. The reqs for the MIP should *absolutely* be nailed down and carved in stone. The only way this isn't the case is if the org doesn't know what business it's in, because that's how you chose these requirements for the MIP. Either that or, much more likely, this isn't how those requirements were chosen and you're not working on an MIP.\n\nIn that case, yea, if you don't approach a large, complex project in a disciplined way, life sucks. (But, then again, what do you expect? Doing things wrong is unnecessarily hard and frustrating.)\n\nI think a lot of times management looks at processes like Agile or other methodologies as a substitution for doing all of the hard planning work I describe above. They are not. Whatever methodology you choose, that's just a set of tools for execution and tracking of the necessary planning work. But none of these are going to save you if you're just doing the wrong things in the wrong order. Perfect tracking of a requirement that was inserted way too early in the project plan as it whips everyone around isn't a solution to any kind of problem, it's an indicator that there *is* a problem that someone needs to step in and solve by moving planning around. (And this kind of stuff will happen, and the methodologies do help identify them.)\n\nThe point of these methodologies is communication. Once a bunch of smart people have gotten into a room and come up with a plan, how do you convey that plan and map it down to specific daily tasks that everyone can execute? That's the big where Agile or whatever can shine.\n\nI often see another mistake that orgs make along the same lines, which is not respecting [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law). I've been on teams where management is told about Conway's law and they respond by saying, oh, this is great, now that I know about it, I can break it and, because we're aware we're breaking it, we can navigate around the potential pitfalls. This way, I get the org chart I want to manage, and we can have the technical architecture we want to produce, and those two things can stay decoupled.\n\nThey all learn in the end that, no, they're not decoupled, and that doesn't doesn't. You either build your architecture around your team structure, or you structure your teams around your architecture, and you have to choose. There is no third path.",

      "text": "Hello, fellow software architects!\n\nLast year, I started writing a Python C4 model authoring tool, and today it has come to a point where I feel good enough to share it with you guys so you can start playing around with it locally and render the C4 model views with PlantUML.\n\nUnder the hood, it follows Structurizr's schema (see [https://github.com/structurizr/json](https://github.com/structurizr/json) ) when storing the model in-memory and when writing it into a JSON file. So it is also compatible with any Structurizr-compatible rendering tool.\n\nYou can find out more about it in [https://buildzr.dev](https://buildzr.dev)\n\n# Quick Example\n\nHere's an example code straight from the README (I use image because Reddit doesn't support syntax highlighting -- if you want to copy, head out to [https://buildzr.dev](https://buildzr.dev) ).\n\n[Creating a workshop, and defining the models and their relationships.](https://preview.redd.it/q6u11qeipidg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=59cd8c21adbf2dde5d212e95d782788ca3001bb5)\n\n[Next, we create two standard structurizr views: a SystemContextView and a ContainerView](https://preview.redd.it/oc2n9gnruidg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=db276a5ecfb2cbc446e9c7ae201572c1dbfbab42)\n\n[You can \\`import\\` themes \\(icons and\\/or colors\\) and apply it to styles.](https://preview.redd.it/dya5hqe4widg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=32418939a7983cf344334e0aca0dadae2f1f8732)\n\n[Finally, we can export the workspace to JSON; or, to PlantUML, or SVG to be rendered later.](https://preview.redd.it/nlybgr5eqidg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6ff42dba15ea76995b93d667fd2e359c4fe8bc1)\n\n[Bonus: Mypy will complain about illegal relationships!](https://preview.redd.it/zhwxm1yrqidg1.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f07772a5f82d0d857b2f385b3c7b268b87bc94d)\n\n# Works in Jupyter Notebook\n\nYou can also render the model in Jupyter Notebook, which I think will be useful for iteratively working on the models and views. Below is the screenshot from VS Code:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jetaw77tidg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a67d78cf6e80f06c4dc9512a81f375e89b285e0c\n\n# Features\n\n* ***Intuitive Pythonic Syntax***: Use Python's context managers (`with` statements) to create nested structures that naturally mirror your architecture's hierarchy.\n* ***Programmatic Creation***: Use buildzr's DSL APIs to programmatically create C4 model architecture diagrams. Great for automation!\n* ***Advanced Styling***: Style elements beyond just tags --- target by direct reference, type, group membership, or custom predicates for fine-grained visual control. Just take a look at [Styles](https://buildzr.dev/user-guide/styles/)!\n* ***Cloud Provider Themes***: Add AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and Oracle Cloud icons to your diagrams with IDE-discoverable constants. No more memorizing tag strings! See [Themes](https://buildzr.dev/user-guide/themes/).\n* ***Type Safety***: Write Structurizr diagrams more securely with extensive type hints and Mypy support.\n* ***Standards Compliant***: Stays true to the Structurizr JSON schema standards. buildzr uses datamodel-code-generator to automatically generate the low-level representation of the Workspace model.\n* ***Rich Toolchain***: Uses the familiar Python programming language and its rich toolchains to write software architecture models and diagrams!\n\n# Find out more\n\nThanks for reading this far!\n\nIf you're interested, feel free to ask me any questions about the project.\n\nGitHub repo: [https://github.com/amirulmenjeni/buildzr](https://github.com/amirulmenjeni/buildzr)\n\nDocumentation here: [https://buildzr.dev](https://buildzr.dev)",

      "text": "I am building a microservices-based application that consists of multiple services (service-1, service-2, service-3, etc.), an API Gateway, and a Service Registry. For security, I am using **Keycloak**.\n\nHowever, I am currently a bit confused about the overall security architecture. I have listed my questions below, and I would really appreciate it if you could share your expertise.\n\n1. From my understanding of the Keycloak architecture: when a client hits our signup or login endpoint, the request should be redirected to Keycloak. After that, everything is handled by Keycloak, which then returns a JWT token that is used to access all protected endpoints. Does this mean that we do **not** need to implement our own signup/login endpoints in our system at all?\n2. If my understanding of Keycloak is correct, how can I manage different roles for different user types (for example, Customer and Admin)? I ll have two different endpoints for registering customers and admins, but I am unable to figure out how role assignment and role mapping should work in this case.\n3. Should I use the API Gateway as a single point where **authentication, authorization, and routing** are all handled, leaving the downstream services without any security checks? Or should the API Gateway handle authentication and authorization, while each individual service still has its own security layer to validate the JWT token? what is the standard way for this?\n4. Are there any other important aspects I should consider while designing the security architecture that I might be missing right now?\n\nThank you!",

Yep, although you will need your own frontend sign up/login pages potentially if you don't use the keycloak defaults\n2. Just add the roles in the keycloak management app (that you will have to host yourself). Or you can add them via API calls from your own services\n3. Authorization should be based on the roles in the JWT inside your app and services, routing in the gateway, and authentication could happen in either\n4. See 0",

          "text": "1. There is an extra step in the standard authentication flow. Keycloak gives you an id token and you go back to keycloak for an access token. I forget now how much of this the keycloak api hides but it is important to know there are 2 tokens. The access token lets you access resources. \n\nRegarding the actual question - in the standard oicd flow the idp (keycloak) displays the login an captures the clients credentials - you never see them. You can style the keycloak login box. You want this because it is how single sign in federation works. On a mobile device it is a little ugly but most people use an embedded web page. \n\n2. Your access token has claims that represent what the user can do. You can add your own claims and have keycloak add them to the tokens. How you use the claims depends on how you have designed authorization in your app. \n\n3. Yes. Best practice is to check authorization at every layer. Have an api gateway and authorize there. This is good because you can reject illegitimate traffic there and not let it inside the system. Also check the jwt and claims in your services. Checking the token is lightweight - just a signature check and it is built into the web frameworks of most stacks. \n\n4. If you haven’t look up the Google beyond prod document. This has a lot of security architecture guidance. Also, get a thorough understanding of oicd flows.",

It has been rock solid for 30yrs.\n\nI would first ask how these logs are intended to be used (what are the use cases). Is it a regulatory requirement, internal reporting etc. this will influence design rationale. \n\nI would then ask how long the activity logs need to be retained for, what volumes are you expect, what growth and how critical they are to the service you are providing. This will influence scale and service need in the design. Simple things as table truncation are easy and effective where long term retention isn't needed. For long time series storage solutions (an option in Postgres) you can even down sample data points over time.\n\nFinally, consider the ongoing operational support. Sure it's easy to spin up a DB service in most cloud environments, but you still need internal support knowledge and experience for the life of the solution. This needs to be factored in.\n\nWith that I would then do some rough options analysis. Why a NoSQL like MongoDB and not Postgres, or logstash, or even using Grafana and graphite.  Understand and discuss the trade offs and then make the decision. Otherwise it's personal opinion that increases code complexity.",

The concrete model implements those hooks using persistence concerns.\n\nIt’s not a replacement for DDD, and not a defense of Active Record either — more an attempt to formalize a pragmatic middle ground that many teams seem to arrive at organically.\n\nThe article uses a simple hotel booking example (Python / SQLAlchemy), discusses trade-offs limits of the pattern, and explains where other approaches fit better.\n\nArticle: [https://medium.com/@hamza-senhajirhazi/domain-composed-models-dcm-a-pragmatic-middle-ground-between-active-record-and-clean-ddd-e44172a58246](https://medium.com/@hamza-senhajirhazi/domain-composed-models-dcm-a-pragmatic-middle-ground-between-active-record-and-clean-ddd-e44172a58246)\n\nI’d be genuinely interested in counter-examples or critiques—especially from people who’ve applied DDD in production systems.",

      "text": "Hi everyone. I’m a junior  developer, currently working alone on a fairly large project. I want to keep the codebase clean, consistent, and built with a solid architecture.\n\nI have a few architectural questions and would really appreciate feedback from more experienced developers.\n\n# 1) Entity / DTO / Response and services\n\nAt the moment, I have many endpoints, and as a result my service layer contains a large number of different DTOs and response classes. This makes the code harder to read and maintain.\n\nI’ve considered several approaches:\n\n* Making services return **one common DTO**, and mapping it to specific response objects in the controller\n* Or returning **entities directly from services**, and doing the mapping to response objects in controllers (with response classes located near controllers)\n\nThe problem is that when working with entities, unnecessary relations are often fetched, which increases database load—especially if I always return a single “large” DTO.  \nAt the same time, according to best practices, services are usually not supposed to return entities directly.\n\nBut what if services always return entities, and mapping is done only in controllers?  \nHow bad (or acceptable) is this approach in real-world projects?\n\nWhich approach is generally considered more correct in production systems?\n\n# 2) Complex business logic and use cases\n\nI’ve been reading books about DDD and Clean Code and tried to reduce the size of my services:\n\n* Part of the business logic was moved into entities\n* Services now look more like use-case scenarios\n\nHowever, some use cases are still quite complex.\n\nFor example:\n\n* There is `UserService.create()` which saves a user\n* After that, an email might be sent, related entities might be created, or other services might be called\n\nCurrently, this is implemented using domain events:\n\n    publisher.publish(new UserCreatedEvent(user));\n    \n\nThe downside is that when you open the service code, it’s not always clear **what actually happens**, unless you inspect all the event listeners.\n\nSo I’m considering another approach:\n\n* `UserService` — only CRUD operations and repository access\n* `UserUseCaseService` — orchestration of complex business scenarios\n\nExample:\n\n    userService.create(user);\n    \n    mailService.sendEmail(user.getEmail());\n    userApplicationService.create(user);\n    \n\nThe questions are:\n\n* Is this approach over-engineered?\n* Is it acceptable in production to introduce a separate “use-case” layer for complex operations?\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice and real-world examples from your experience 🙌",

Using these, I try to figure out which shift an employee worked, whether they were late, overtime, etc. Day shifts work perfectly fine, but night shifts and overlapping shifts are causing issues.\nShifts are very flexible: some start early, others late, many cross midnight, and some overlap. Because of this, grouping punches by calendar day doesn’t work. Processing is done by a scheduled job that must run at a specific time. The problem is that at that moment, some shifts are still in progress while others are starting, which leads to incomplete or incorrect grouping—for example, a punch during a night shift might be interpreted as a full shift or a very short one.\nI’m looking for a general approach to assign raw timestamped events to shifts when shifts can overlap or be incomplete at processing time. Any patterns, strategies, or best practices would be super helpful.",

This concept also relates to scheduled shifts that have start/end times.\n\nYou can look for overlapping time spans to match time punch pairs with shifts and use minute thresholds for identifying early/late punches.\n\nGenerally, to solve overnight shifts, you should always include the prior day’s punches and shifts to ensure nothing was left out. You may be looking at a Monday-Sunday calendar but care about data Sunday-Sunday for example.\n\nAt some point labor laws can feed into your rules and you can make assumptions about missed punches if they’re further apart than a state’s mandatory break period (but understand that varies from state to state and even city to city in some places so it’s best to let users configure these rules for themselves).\n\nYou should be in a good position storing raw punch data, creating a higher level construct like punch pairs (being able to identify when one is missing), then finally matching that against your shift data using overlapping time ranges.\n\nKnowing that certain punch pairs are contained or required helps suggest further missing data (for example: a pair of break punches suggests you may be missing the shift punch pair or uninterrupted shifts over n-hours may be missing breaks.",

Keep the actual billable separate from the billable reference used for other new Orders\n2. Have distinct logic for how updates cascade, or don't cascade, to and from Articles in Orders (line items). Maybe you can eliminate cascading from here to Articles altogether even, eliminating the cyclical dependency.\n  - On the topic of eliminating cyclical dependency with this, is it key that Orders really can change the original Article reference (price)?

          "text": ">Is a cyclic dependency acceptable between module?\n\nNo.\n\n>If cycles are discouraged, what is the recommended way to model this kind of cross-domain business logic while keeping modules independent?\n\nModule dependencies must form a DAG. The DAG can have one or more \"root\" modules which are completely independent, and these modules should define entities and possibly behaviors of the business that are the most stable, i.e., unlikely to change over versions and time.\n\nIn this case, it's possible to have articles in stock but no orders, whereas it is not possible to have orders if you have no articles for sale. The existence of orders depends upon the prior existence of articles, so the direction of dependency in your model should reflect that by having Order depend upon Article.\n\nThe simple way to do this is to invert the reverse dependency (Article -> Order). There are several ways to do this.\n\nThe simplest and most straightforward way is to define the Order interface in the Article module. In this approach, since Order interface belongs to the Article module, when the Article class depends upon that interface there's no issue. Then in the Order module, OrderImpl depends on the Order interface, which is the Order -> Article module dependency.\n\nHowever, you may not want the Order interface to belong to the Article module because this means that Article is responsible for defining what an Order is, and when that definition changes you have to deploy the Article module (and, of course, all dependent modules). This may or may not make sense for your app.\n\nMore likely, nothing in the Article module needs to know or care about anything to do with orders, and so the Order interface shouldn't live in that module. In this case, you need to understand what information they both share. For example, when an article changes price, orders need that updated info, which implies that there needs to be a shared price map.\n\nOne way to do this is to simply have something in the Article module update the price map and then notify listeners of the change. When an order is created, it registers a listener and will receive the updated price map whenever it changes, once the order is validated, it deregisters its listener. Maybe the price map is large and that's a lot of data flying around when only one price changes. In that case, you can publish just the articles that are updated instead of the entire price map.\n\nThis approach can be fragile, though, depending on what your deployment looks like. If these modules are guaranteed to be deployed in the same runtime, it's probably not a big deal, but one point of modularizing is being able to scale different parts of the system independently, so you shouldn't assume these will always and forever be deployed together. Better would be to assume they could be placed on different servers someday, but that means you now need something durable like a reliable database queue. You need monitoring that will notify and page when the queue gets backed up, etc.\n\nAnother solution is to simply update the price map in the DB. When an order is created, it reads all of the prices and treats them as provisional, and then if there are any price changes at validation, it processes those however it needs to. This could be simple, just updating the number, or complicated, like splitting the order into two and validating the sub-order with items that didn't change, then round tripping the sub-order containing updated prices with the customer. The customer might want to put through the sub-order with unchanged prices right away, or hold off and deal with the updated items so the system can merge the two back together into a single order or whatever.\n\nIf this happened here, though, it seems likely that a proper solution is going to necessitate fixing a bunch of other issues that come up. Such is the nature of spaghetti dependencies. If you run into that situation trying to fix this problem, that would be a red flag that you need to step back and treat this as a separate project unto itself. You will likely need to get your arms around the current out-of-control dependency structure before you can even contemplate fixing individual use cases because they will continue to pivot through the current dependency structure. (That is the problem with losing control of deps in the first place.)",

                  "text": "Which of the approaches I would recommend from your bulleted list depends upon the architecture, scaling considerations, infrastructure you already have (or could have) available to you, and many other things.\n\nWhen I step back and think about this, it makes sense to me that the price list of articles already has to exist in the database anyway. That being the case, the Order module could simply look it up as I explain in the last bit of my post above. However, you are not jumping at this solution, which leads me to think that these modules currently use different databases. IOW, this is a microservice architecture.\n\nIf that's so, there's your problem. The microservice architecture is based on the notion that each team gets to own one or more small stovepipes that sit atop their own little data store, and the one and only dependency each of these microservices ever has to worry about is its own API at the top of its stack. The point of this approach is to adhere to Conway's law, giving each team total control over its own little slice of the universe and the ability to entirely and explicitly define the contract they agree to support. When one team needs something from another team, there's no choice but to negotiate and settle the requested API, so nothing flies under the radar.\n\nMost orgs that try this approach don't fully commit to it, though. At some point, instead of hitting the User service every time you want user data, other microservices just start caching that user info in their own data source. This works well enough until users get removed and the cached services continue serving that user's data. This is inconvenient, and then because of GDPR, it becomes illegal. Oops!\n\nBut they still don't want to hit the User service API, so instead why not just put a pub/sub queue at the bottom of the User service so when users are removed, anyone who cares gets notified? Sounds good, except there's no way to control who subscribes to this queue, and for what purpose. So now the queue needs to become a fully fledged queue service with access controls, etc, etc. And BTW, oops, now the User service is supporting the API at the top of its stack as well as the format of the User object it puts on the queue, and since it has no idea why others are consuming that data and what they're using it for, it can only grow in backwards compatible ways over time but nothing can be removed.\n\nBefore this got out of control, though, this queue solved this problem so well why not do the same thing in other places? So queues proliferate, and now all services are supporting APIs at the top and bottom of their stacks. (It's easier to get data from a queue rather than via an API, so that's how a lot of functionality gets implemented. So much for explicit contracts and negotiations!) No one really knows what clients are consuming what data for what purpose, so this microservices architecture has basically just become a mechanism for uncontrolled dependency to proliferate through the entire system. At this point, many orgs give up and just start giving services direct access to each other's data sources, or worse, they start allowing mid-stack cross-talk, and things have effectively become a poorly architected monolith at this point.\n\nThis is why most orgs find that adopting a microservice architecture turns out to be nothing more than a years-long way to accumulate tech debt.",

But I would not recommend something like this even to an to an individual with multiple years of experience in enterprise environments. \n\nThe most worrisome part is that you’ve mentioned the data is sensitive and is strictly required to be self hosted. If something happens and there are legal repercussions that come back your way then it would be terrible to have that happen so early in your career. You’re already off to an amazing start and it would be awful to have something like that holding you back before you even really got started. \n\nIt would be one thing to do something small for a mom and pop shop but it sounds like you are designing their infrastructure from the ground up for an organization handling sensitive information with strict compliance and reporting requirements. Again, it’s not a matter of can you or can’t you, it’s a matter of should you. \n\nHave you signed any contracts with them? Have you worked with a lawyer or had them looked at? If you haven’t signed anything with them then what is guaranteeing your legal safety?\n\nVery awkward position to be in if something happens so the commenters encouraging you to walk the other way are saying so out of concern for you. You sound like you’ve got a great head-start on whatever career you’re trying to pursue and there’s lots of ways for you to go from here, but this situation seems like taking a big risk for minimal gain.",

I'm trying to figure out the best approach for a graph builder, with syntax like\n\n    const graph = new GraphBuilder().directed().weighted().build();\n    // builder also has bipartite(), cyclic() etc\n    \n    then I can graph.addNodes(nodeData).addEdges(edgeData);\n    // and graph.depthFirstSearch(...), graph.nearestNeighbours(...) etc\n    \n\nFirst question, does this approach make sense or will I run into major issues? And for the graph class itself, how should I go about implementing its functions? Would it make sense for the builder to build up one strategy and the graph executes like:\n\n    // class Graph ...\n    \n    addNodes(...) {\n       this.strategy.addNodes()\n    }\n\nor am I going down a dark path/ there is a better way\n\nOverall rationale for the approach is to avoid having to implement each combination of graph type   \n",

          "text": "As an indirect answer, this is a fun challenge! So many choices to make  \n1 - The more you want your graph to be able to do, the less it does.  \n2 - the properties of the graph are VERY tied to the properties of the edges and nodes, so inherritance or not, there's some. hard choices to make to keep the data you provide and the methods you operate with, compatible.  \n3 - data storage vs representation. Once you have a happy in-ram solution, I'd recommend you think about how this best works when you have thousands of nodes and edges.\n\nIf you aren't pressed for time, or have to turn this in for an assignment or whatever, just... pick one. Pick a strategy, and then focus on the tests -- the tests where you pretend to use different graphs for different purposes withe the same \"super\" handling it all. That should give you a lot of \"ah-hah\" behind what you like and what you don't. Maybe it's efficient but the API gets super clunky? Maybe the API is smooth but it just... can't do certain things even though it looks like it should?\n\nAt the end of the day, any ugliness on the inside, that makes it beautiful on the outside, is worthwhile. Graphs are to be used, after all.\n\nHighly recommend.",
