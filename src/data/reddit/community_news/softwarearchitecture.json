But that model also lacks resilience.  In other words, it's too simple. \n\nA decentralized system like a web has a communications complexity of O(N^2).  It's more complex but much more resilient while still being tractable.\n\nI have a personal belief that there's something near magical about O(N^2) being the measurable complexity of a system.  For me that goes beyond system architecture and into things like social structures. \n\nIsn't it interesting for example that when humanity turned ownership of their personal relationships over to social media companies, that this is when society started forming echo chambers and really going nuts?  I think this in large regard has to do with the fact that your relationships with extended friends on Facebook aren't really yours anymore.  They're Facebook's, and we've moved human relationships from the web model that has existed since the time of chimpanzees to a simple hub-and-spoke model. \n\nO(N^2), I'm telling you, it's special.  It trends naturally toward resilience and self-healing.  Go elsewhere at your peril.",

          "text": "I'm interested to see other answers here, but I feel like you're asking for theoretical math frameworks to apply to engineering in a way that would let you deterministically descend through a system design.  \n\nIn reality, that's not how it works.  It's just as much art as anything approaching real engineering; much less science or being provably correct.  For starters, you almost never know all the requirements up front and your design must adapt over time to accommodate new requirements as they are discovered or asserted.\n\nTo help guide a system design, one chooses an organizing architecture and follows design principles in order to ensure consistency, try ensure the necessary degree of resilience, scalability, and correctness - all custom to the specific situation.  \n\nA big help in doing this is to know what patterns have been followed before for the kind of work you're doing.  A patterns repository is a big help with that.  Of course, there are different types of patterns as well.  \n\n- Design patterns\n- Architectural patterns\n- Anti-patterns\n- Analysis patterns\n\nThese are simply languages that help you talk about your system.  You can have opinions all day long, but if you cannot communicate your ideas in a way that allows others to participate in the creation of your system, then it's not going to enjoy much success and patterns help communicate your approach in a clear way and give you some guidelines to use in creating it.  \n\nTo be clear, even if you don't believe a word of what I'm saying, you will use patterns anyway.  Everyone adopts the repeatable practices that form a path of least resistance.  But you can do that in a fully conscious way and avoid trying to reinvent the wheel at every turn.  \n\n\n| **Category**               | **URL**                                                                                                                                                           | **Description**                                                                                         |\n| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Design patterns**        | [https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) ([Refactoring Guru][1])                                                      | A comprehensive and practical catalog of software design patterns with explanations and examples.       |\n| **Architectural patterns** | [https://architectural-patterns.net/](https://architectural-patterns.net/) ([architectural-patterns.net][2])                                                      | A site focused on patterns used in software system architecture with explanations and pattern catalogs. |\n| **Anti-patterns**          | [https://kb.segersian.com/software-architecture/topics/anti-patterns/](https://kb.segersian.com/software-architecture/topics/anti-patterns/) ([Knowledgebase][3]) | A general knowledge base listing common software anti-patterns and explanations.                        |\n| **Analysis patterns**      | [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_analysis_pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_analysis_pattern) ([Wikipedia][4])                               | Wikipedia entry explaining analysis patterns in software engineering with definitions and context.      |\n\n[1]: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Design Patterns\"\n[2]: https://architectural-patterns.net/?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Home | Architectural Patterns\"\n[3]: https://kb.segersian.com/software-architecture/topics/anti-patterns/?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Anti Patterns | Knowledgebase\"\n[4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_analysis_pattern?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Software analysis pattern\"\n\nEdit:  Refactoring Guru also refers to https://metapatterns.io/, which is a pretty nice resource as well.",

That's when folks reach towards something like TLA+, Alloy, or even Lean3 or something like that.\n\nPersonally, I've been able to get away with just thinking about systems in terms of invariants (what must always be true), and show that progress will be made with the only tests being quickcheck or hedgehog.

Really interesting stuff, because those eventually/always logical statements can be effectively evaluated with Bochi automata which is some really cool maths.\n\nHowever, if you are talking performance analysis, then there are ways to get answers with TLA+, like counting \"for loop ticks\" or \"memory access\" for a random input of length N, but there's usually a better/faster way if you're after just performance numbers.\n\nFinally, the really hard thing about TLA+, and I think why it's only rarely used, is that you still don't get around the problem that your model and code diverge. The TLA+ spec might be used at the beginning of development to prove your state machines semantics will work, but 14 months and a new team later, things change.",

It carries years of edge cases, integrations, reporting, and revenue. I can’t simply ditch it and start on a greenfield, but I also can’t keep it as-is: complexity grows with every sprint, cognitive load increases, clear team ownership boundaries become impossible, and time to market slowing down.\n\n**What worked**\n\nLooking into design patterns, I found the Strangler Fig pattern that everyone mentions but in practice, it’s not enough. You also need an Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL). Without an ACL, you can’t keep the legacy system running without regression while new hosts run side by side.\n\nThey both allow you to incrementally replace specific pieces of functionality while the legacy system continues to run.\n\n[ The legacy system has no responsibilities left thus can be decommissioned.](https://preview.redd.it/k8xx43u7dheg1.png?width=3156&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7cc931bfe4880623f54e5a2366847d55d724244)\n\n**Important note** \n\nThis kind of service separation should only be done when justified. For example, when you need team ownership boundaries or different hardware requirements. The example here is meant to explain the approach, not to suggest that every monolith should be split.\n\n**One caveat**\n\nThis approach only works for systems where you *can* introduce a strangler. If you’re dealing with something like a background service “big ball of mud” with no interception point, then the next-gen is the way.\n\nThis is the [link](https://www.justifiedcode.com/modernizing-a-monolithic-application) where you can find all steps and diagrams, from the initial monolith to the final state, with an optional PDF download.",

You captured the reality well: you can't rewrite overnight, but you also can't keep bolting onto legacy debt forever.\n\nIn your example, how are you handling orchestration between these new services? I noticed the arrows in your diagram look like service-to-service choreography. At [Luther](https://reddit.com/r/luthersystems) we’ve moved toward a \"distributed orchestrator\" model using what we call Common Operation Scripts (COS), with ACLs in front of each system. Have you found choreography enough or do you eventually hit a \"spaghetti\" wall where you need this kind of central coordination?",

Check out [https://codingfox.net.pl/posts/mim/#high-cohesion](https://codingfox.net.pl/posts/mim/#high-cohesion) (chapter \"8. Appendix - Introduction to Modular Design\", point \"High Cohesion\") for more explanation \n* Your design also breaks Low Coupling pattern (you coupled all modules in WebApi)\n* As a result, a simple change to e.g. Menus feature, will probably result with changes in 4 modules (in ideal world only one would be affected).\n\nYour question aside, I can tell you that your design is not really modular. It groups code into \"nouns\", so probably any \\_real\\_ business feature requires 2 or 3 modules to coordinate. That's will result in a big ball of mud sooner or later. Modules are self-contained, check out the \"A Module in the Modular Design\" subchapter (the same link as above).\n\nI also think that your modules are unnecessarily split by \"layers\", but is it really helpful?, or rather forces devs to constantly jump around? Instead split code by \"processes\" or \"features\" (and only extract \"infra\" code per module if you need to test it separately). You can see what I mean here: [https://codingfox.net.pl/posts/mim/#business-modules](https://codingfox.net.pl/posts/mim/#business-modules) (chapter \"Business-Modules\" of \"Simplify your Application Architecture with Modular Design and MIM\").

But is just means that Menu depends on Food. What if you will need something from Menu in Food?\n\nThere's a heuristic that says \"a module should be ready to be extracted as a microservice\". In most cases it won't be ever extracted, but the point is it forces you to think about processes, not nouns.\n\nIf you have a large number or direct (method call) or indirect (messages) usages of one module in another, you would be better off merging them.\n\nInstead of thinking about \"Menu\" and \"Food\", make for instance an \"Ordering process\" module and separate \"Delivery process\" module. Arrange data so that each module has all data they need to fulfill it's responsibilities.\n\nI included a long list of resources that describe the modular design process. (Making a design based on nouns is so 1999 ;) )\n\nBTW: A case from just 2 weeks ago. In one of the services a big feature turned out to be unnecessary. I got rid of it in code by removing ONE module (and the registration from program.cs). In types of designs showed here, it should be shotgun surgery through many modules (csprojs) to remove a feature.",

      "text": "Hi, I'm currently designing an e-commerce system using a modular monolith architecture. I have decided to implement three different layers for each module: Router, to expose my endpoints; Service, for my business logic; and Repository, for CRUD operations. The flow is simple: Router gets a request, passes it to the Service, which interacts with Repository if necessary, and then the response follows the same path back. Additionally, I am using a single PostgreSQL database.\n\nThe problem I'm facing is that but when deciding how to communicate between modules, I have found several options:\n\n* **Dependency Injection (Service Layer):** Injecting, for example, `PaymentService` into `OrderService`. It's simple, but it seems to add coupling and gives `OrderService` unnecessary access to the entire `PaymentService` implementation when I only need a specific method.\n* **Expose modules endpoints:** Using internal HTTP calls. It’s an option, but it introduces latency and loses some of the \"monolith\" benefits.\n* **Event-bus communication:** Not an option. The application is being designing for a local shop, won't have much traffic so I consider implementing a queue message will be adding unnecesary complexity.\n* **Module Gateway:** Creating a gateway for each module as a single point of access. While it might seem like a single point of failure, I like that it delegates orchestration to a specific class and I think it will scale well. However, I’m concerned about it becoming a duplicate of the Service layer.\n\nI’m looking for your opinions, as I am new to system design and this decision is taking up a lot of my research time.",

But it can be pretty minimal, like a function that calls different modules sequentially. Think about a Use-Case Controller. It would need access to several modules, of course - so inject them as dependencies.\n\nThe thing is, this is now your actual service layer. This is the crux of your application that clients will interact with. They don't really see the underlying modules anymore - they focus on the desired behavior or the \"what\", not the \"how\". You've now composed a rich process controller out of its constituent parts.\n\nTraditionally, this is called a mediator - an object that talks to many different objects to manage a complex process by passing data and calls back and forth. However, lately the word \"mediator\" has been hijacked (mostly by the .NET people, see MediatR) to mean \"a command dispatcher\". Keep this in mind when looking for code examples.",

Modules are self-contained, isolated, coherent \"processes\". If you need to make queries between modules and they constantly chat to do any flow, it means you have:\n\na) One big module  \nb) Or a big ball of mud antipattern.\n\nThere're many materials on that. One of the latest I've seen: [https://norbert.tech/blog/2025-10-18/dark-sides-of-modularization/](https://norbert.tech/blog/2025-10-18/dark-sides-of-modularization/) and there are more in \"Resources\" section on my MIM text. If you have FK between tables, any migration to microservice would be impossible (and that's one of heuristic for a well designed module),\n\nIf you need to do reports from data, you have to build a read-model. But that's a different topic.\n\n>Also, this \"Public API\" you mentioned is like my gateway approach but with a great tech name,\n\n\"Public API\" is like a facade. But it doesn't have to be Facade pattern per se or even an interface.\n\n>What about when the communication is between entities from the same module? \n\nI've never seen an \"inter-module communication\" done differently than DI or direct method calls. Well, I have seen an inter (and intra) communication that used an external message queue, but there was a reason for that (time sync was required).\n\nTo be honest, inside one module I don't even create interfaces, because I test whole modules end-to-end (Chicago School of tests), so I don't have to mock anything.",

          "text": "Minor details that might make your life a little easier\n\nSystem Design:\nIt might be easier to turn member class into a base user class as an abstract parent class and create Moderator, Admin, Member, and Visitor. That way you can more easily manage permissions between the different user types ie ‘Admin().CreateEvent()’, ‘Moderator().ApproveNewsStory()’, etc. \n\nIn the reset password flow, in my experience I don’t check if the email exists and tell give the user feedback. I just tell the user “a recovery email will be sent to that email if it exists”. If you give specific feedback like that, it can create a security gap where a threat actor is effectively querying your database for user emails.\n\nIn your event registration block, it kinda looks like you’re storing the users event registration before you confirm their payment and available space. If any of the payment and confirmation process fails or the user quits out of the flow, you’ll need to undo that operation. I would do something like [user requests registration -> check available tickets/space* -> if space, request payment from user -> if payment confirmed, save user registration and inform user]\n*Ideally, you’re only displaying available events to the user at the very beginning of this workflow but theres always the edge case of there being 1 seat available and another user takes it while the current user is looking at this page\n\n\nNitpicks/Personal Preference:\nI like to add colors to my diagrams :) you’ll be staring at them a lot and it helps when there’s another layer of visual depth\n\nIn your sequence diagrams, the [alt] and [opt] conditions should be placed at the left most edge of those visual containers so it’s easier for others to quickly read and process what you’re doing. Don’t want to have people looking for “if….what?”. Sequence diagrams should be read left-to-right AND top-to-bottom\n\nYou’ll get mixed opinions on whether you should number your requests in a sequence. I personally don’t since the nature of the sequence is already sequential. If I need to draw attention to specific flows, I create separate diagrams or I create separate sections with their own titles on the diagram if their actors and entities are the same. \n\nIn your final sequence diagram that covers event registration, the actors/entities that are only used in the [alt] blocks (payment and participation) should still be defined at the very top of your diagram with the other entities/actors of your system. \n\nThe use case diagrams have a lot of visual noise. It might be better to break them up per user type. Sure, you’ll get some duplicate scenarios but the few seconds spent duplicating the diagrams will be worth making it easier to read.",

As systems grow, number of teams grow, org maturity mandates come into effect, we want more comprehensive checks (architecture, security, performance, conventions, etc.), but long checklists quickly get ignored because they slow reviews down - totally empathize with that.\n\nEspecially with LLM-assisted coding becoming more common, I’m also noticing more design drift - code that works, passes review, but slowly diverges from intended architecture and patterns accumulating technical debts in the blind if you will. This is getting harder to catch with today’s PR process.\n\nI’m exploring an idea around making PR checks more adaptive and context-aware, without overwhelming developers.\n\nCurious to hear:\n\nDo you use PR checklists today?\n\n1. Have you experienced checklist fatigue?\n2. Have you noticed increased design drift increasing with LLM-assisted coding?\n3. Would love to hear how others are dealing with this. ",

This is possible and should be used.  \nSecond is automated test case which can run as part of CI/CD pipeline, particularly security and performance related checks, so even if they are missed in code review, they are caught in the pipeline.  \nWe also use LLM assisted code review, with tools like Code Rabbit and Claude which can catch many of the issues. You can ask teach CodeRabbit about your particular coding pattern, or any issues you want it to identify in future and next time onwards it can identify those issue. Same way you can ask Claude to review your code and find specific issues and in the system prompt you can ask it to find particular way a code is written the flag it.",

You should be able to copy a class, add an object to a list somewhere, and done. If it's more complicated, you should be able to just @ inject a new module and still call it a day early. If your architecture / convention requires modifying 5 files to plumb in your new code nobody will ever do it. Don't make them do that, and they'll follow the pattern.\n* Security: Devops security checkers exist, or if you'd prefer, only require reviews if touching designated \"high risk\" files like password management code.\n* Performance: Have a canary environment. Block a release if performance decreases X% day-over-day. Done, no sense in hand wringing about whether some statement takes a bit longer in reviews.\n\nThat seems like a reasonable start to me, though of course this is something that has to evolve in-house over time :)",

If you finish storing the result of a transaction including all in memory processing then really that means you've finished the storage end.  So we're down to a database ACID transaction, and usually a simple one that doesn't require even a multi-phase commit (though they're still out there if you really need them).  Even if you're doing something really old fashioned with a file operation, there's usually an rdbms status or something you need to mark as complete at the end.\n\nSecondly is the lessened need for ACID in many modern applications.  In a bank transaction, it is absolutely necessary to make sure that debits and credits balance, and this is the origin of ACID's necessity.  But if you need to deliver a social media notification then the need to ensure a correct transaction becomes a lot fuzzier.  If something fails, it's not the end of the world, and the notification can be delivered later when things are working better.  This is the world of no-sql where full ACID isn't considered necessary even in storage. \n\nI last saw a CORBA application in the wild about five years ago during a cloud migration.  Everybody was scared to touch the thing.  I spent weeks trying to figure out what it even did.  There didn't seem to be any way to move the stupid thing.  For all I know they left it running forever.",

The implementation is simple: you start a database transaction at the beginning of the request and end it when request processing finishes.\n\nThere are a few problems when a task involves an external service.  \n1 - Trying to do a multi-system transaction is very hard and costly. Because of that, many approaches exist to ensure that work is done fully or not at all, or that partially completed work can be mitigated.  \n2 - If you call one or more external systems during a transaction, it can take a lot of time. During that whole time the transaction stays open, which is very bad for database performance. As a result, we now try a similar approach as with multiple services: ensure that even if part of a task fails, the saved state is recoverable.\n\nIn my opinion, doing this well is much harder and more nuanced than the old transaction bracketing :)",

          "text": ">Is a cyclic dependency acceptable between module?\n\nNo.\n\n>If cycles are discouraged, what is the recommended way to model this kind of cross-domain business logic while keeping modules independent?\n\nModule dependencies must form a DAG. The DAG can have one or more \"root\" modules which are completely independent, and these modules should define entities and possibly behaviors of the business that are the most stable, i.e., unlikely to change over versions and time.\n\nIn this case, it's possible to have articles in stock but no orders, whereas it is not possible to have orders if you have no articles for sale. The existence of orders depends upon the prior existence of articles, so the direction of dependency in your model should reflect that by having Order depend upon Article.\n\nThe simple way to do this is to invert the reverse dependency (Article -> Order). There are several ways to do this.\n\nThe simplest and most straightforward way is to define the Order interface in the Article module. In this approach, since Order interface belongs to the Article module, when the Article class depends upon that interface there's no issue. Then in the Order module, OrderImpl depends on the Order interface, which is the Order -> Article module dependency.\n\nHowever, you may not want the Order interface to belong to the Article module because this means that Article is responsible for defining what an Order is, and when that definition changes you have to deploy the Article module (and, of course, all dependent modules). This may or may not make sense for your app.\n\nMore likely, nothing in the Article module needs to know or care about anything to do with orders, and so the Order interface shouldn't live in that module. In this case, you need to understand what information they both share. For example, when an article changes price, orders need that updated info, which implies that there needs to be a shared price map.\n\nOne way to do this is to simply have something in the Article module update the price map and then notify listeners of the change. When an order is created, it registers a listener and will receive the updated price map whenever it changes, once the order is validated, it deregisters its listener. Maybe the price map is large and that's a lot of data flying around when only one price changes. In that case, you can publish just the articles that are updated instead of the entire price map.\n\nThis approach can be fragile, though, depending on what your deployment looks like. If these modules are guaranteed to be deployed in the same runtime, it's probably not a big deal, but one point of modularizing is being able to scale different parts of the system independently, so you shouldn't assume these will always and forever be deployed together. Better would be to assume they could be placed on different servers someday, but that means you now need something durable like a reliable database queue. You need monitoring that will notify and page when the queue gets backed up, etc.\n\nAnother solution is to simply update the price map in the DB. When an order is created, it reads all of the prices and treats them as provisional, and then if there are any price changes at validation, it processes those however it needs to. This could be simple, just updating the number, or complicated, like splitting the order into two and validating the sub-order with items that didn't change, then round tripping the sub-order containing updated prices with the customer. The customer might want to put through the sub-order with unchanged prices right away, or hold off and deal with the updated items so the system can merge the two back together into a single order or whatever.\n\nIf this happened here, though, it seems likely that a proper solution is going to necessitate fixing a bunch of other issues that come up. Such is the nature of spaghetti dependencies. If you run into that situation trying to fix this problem, that would be a red flag that you need to step back and treat this as a separate project unto itself. You will likely need to get your arms around the current out-of-control dependency structure before you can even contemplate fixing individual use cases because they will continue to pivot through the current dependency structure. (That is the problem with losing control of deps in the first place.)",

                  "text": "Which of the approaches I would recommend from your bulleted list depends upon the architecture, scaling considerations, infrastructure you already have (or could have) available to you, and many other things.\n\nWhen I step back and think about this, it makes sense to me that the price list of articles already has to exist in the database anyway. That being the case, the Order module could simply look it up as I explain in the last bit of my post above. However, you are not jumping at this solution, which leads me to think that these modules currently use different databases. IOW, this is a microservice architecture.\n\nIf that's so, there's your problem. The microservice architecture is based on the notion that each team gets to own one or more small stovepipes that sit atop their own little data store, and the one and only dependency each of these microservices ever has to worry about is its own API at the top of its stack. The point of this approach is to adhere to Conway's law, giving each team total control over its own little slice of the universe and the ability to entirely and explicitly define the contract they agree to support. When one team needs something from another team, there's no choice but to negotiate and settle the requested API, so nothing flies under the radar.\n\nMost orgs that try this approach don't fully commit to it, though. At some point, instead of hitting the User service every time you want user data, other microservices just start caching that user info in their own data source. This works well enough until users get removed and the cached services continue serving that user's data. This is inconvenient, and then because of GDPR, it becomes illegal. Oops!\n\nBut they still don't want to hit the User service API, so instead why not just put a pub/sub queue at the bottom of the User service so when users are removed, anyone who cares gets notified? Sounds good, except there's no way to control who subscribes to this queue, and for what purpose. So now the queue needs to become a fully fledged queue service with access controls, etc, etc. And BTW, oops, now the User service is supporting the API at the top of its stack as well as the format of the User object it puts on the queue, and since it has no idea why others are consuming that data and what they're using it for, it can only grow in backwards compatible ways over time but nothing can be removed.\n\nBefore this got out of control, though, this queue solved this problem so well why not do the same thing in other places? So queues proliferate, and now all services are supporting APIs at the top and bottom of their stacks. (It's easier to get data from a queue rather than via an API, so that's how a lot of functionality gets implemented. So much for explicit contracts and negotiations!) No one really knows what clients are consuming what data for what purpose, so this microservices architecture has basically just become a mechanism for uncontrolled dependency to proliferate through the entire system. At this point, many orgs give up and just start giving services direct access to each other's data sources, or worse, they start allowing mid-stack cross-talk, and things have effectively become a poorly architected monolith at this point.\n\nThis is why most orgs find that adopting a microservice architecture turns out to be nothing more than a years-long way to accumulate tech debt.",

      "text": "Hi, I'm tackling a theoretical problem that can soon become very practical. Given a website for sharing videos, assume a new video gets uploaded and gains immediate popularity. Millions of users (each with their own account) start \"liking\" it. As you can imagine, the goal is to handle them all so that:\n\n\\* Each user gets immediate feedback that their like has been registered (whether its impact on the total is immediate or delayed is another thing)\n\n  \n\\* You can revoke your like at any time\n\n  \n\\* Likes are not duplicated - you cannot impart more than 1 like on any given video, even if you click like-unlike a thousand times in rapid succession\n\n  \n\\* The total number of likes is convergent to the number of the users who actually expressed a like, not drifting randomly like Facebook or Reddit comment counts (\"bro got downcommented\" ☠️)\n\n  \n\\* The solution should be cheap and effective, not consume 90% of a project's budget\n\n  \n\\* Absolute durability is not a mandatory goal, but convergence is (say, 10 seconds of likes lost is OK, as long as there is no permanent inconsistency where those likes show up to some people only, or the like-giver thinks their vote is counted where really it is not)\n\n  \nPreviously, I've read tens of articles of varying quality on Medium and similar places. The top concepts that seem to emerge are:\n\n\\* Queueing / streaming by offloading to Kafka (of course - good for absorbing burst traffic, less good for sustained hits)\n\n\\* Relaxing consistency requirements (don't check duplicates at write time, deduplicate in the background - counter increment/decrement not transactional)\n\n\\* Sharded counters (cut up hot partitions into shards, reconstruct at read time)\n\n  \nMy problem is, I'm not thrilled by these proposed solutions. Especially the middle one sounds more like CV padding material than actual code I'd like to see running in production. Having a stochastic anti-entropy layer that recomputes the like count for a sample of my videos all the time? No thank you, I'm not trying to reimplement ScyllaDB. Surely there must be a sane way to go about this.\n\n  \nSo now I'm back to basics. From trying to conceptualize the problem space, I got this:\n\n\\* For every user, there exists a set of the videos they have liked\n\n\\* For every video, there exists a set of the users who have liked it\n\n\\* These sets are not correlated in any way: any user can like any video, so no common sharding key can be found (not good!)\n\n\\* Therefore, the challenge lies in the transformation from a dataset that's trivially shardable by userID to another, which is shardable by videoID (but suffers from hot items)\n\n  \nIf we naively shard the user/like pairs by user ID, we can potentially get strong consistency when doing like generation. So, for any single user, we could maintain a strongly-consistent and exhaustive set of \"you have liked these videos\". Assuming that no user likes a billion videos (we can enforce this!), really hot or heavy shards should not come up. It is very unlikely that very active users would get co-located inside such a \"like-producing\" shard.\n\n  \nBut then, reads spell real trouble. In order to definitely determine the total likes for any video, you have to contact \\*all\\* user shards and ask them \"how many likes for this particular vid?\". It doesn't scale: the more user shards, the more parallel reads. That is a sure-fire sign our service is going to get slower, not faster.\n\n  \nIf we shard by the userID/videoID pair, instead? This helps, but only if we apply a 2-level sharding algorithm: for each video, nominate a subset of shards (servers) of size N. Then, based on userID, pick from among those nominated ones. Then, we still have hot items, but their load is spread over several physical shards. Retrieving the like count for any individial video requires exactly N underlying queries. On the other hand, if a video is sufficiently popular, the wild firehose of inbound likes can still overflow the processing capacity of N shards, since there is no facility to spread the load further if a static N turns out to be not enough.\n\nNow, so far this is the best I could come up with. When it comes to the value of N (each video's likes spread over \\*this many\\* servers), we could find its optimal value. From a backing database's point of view, there probably exists some optimum R:W ratio that depends on whether it uses a WAL, if it has B-Tree indices, etc...\n\n\n\nBut let's look at it from a different angle. A popular video site will surely have a read-side caching layer. We can safely assume the cache is not dumb as a rock, and will do request coalescing (so that a cache miss doesn't result in 100,000 RPS for this video - only one request, or globally as many requests as there are physical cache instances running).\n\n  \nNow, the optimum N looks differently: instead of wondering \"how many read requests times N per second will I get on a popular video\", the question becomes: how long exactly is my long tail of unpopular videos? What minimum cache hit rate do I have to maintain to offset the N multiplier for reads?\n\n  \nSo, for now these are my thoughts. Sorry if they're a bit all over the place.\n\n  \nAll in all, I'm wondering: is there anything else to improve? Would you design a \"Like\" system for the Web differently? Or maybe the \"write now, verify later\" technique has a simple trick I'm not aware of to make it worth it?",

          "text": "Here's what I would try first if you're curious about how to try it yourself:\n\n\\- Install Redis, run redis-benchmark, and look at GET, SET, INCR, DECR. On my older MacBook, each of those do 200,000 operations per second.\n\n\\- Install Rust, write a simple HTTPS server that accepts GET, PUT, PATCH, and call Redis with these.\n\n\\- Use any benchmark tool you like, such as wrk or oha, to discover your throughput of Axum PATCH to Redis INCR meaning \"like\" & DECR meaning \"unlike\".\n\n\\- If the throughput is lower than you need, then buy more CPU power because it's cheaper than development complexity. If your Redis is running low on memory, then buy more RAM because it's cheaper than development complexity. For lots of CPUs and RAM in one server I especially like the Oxide rack.\n\n\\- To get the counts from Redis into your persistent database such as Postgres, add an Axum step to use Redis LPUSH to track the recently-changed keys. Create a background batch job, such as every 10 minutes, to copy the key counts into Postgres.\n\n\\- To track a user's state per video, use Redis Streams and specifically event sourcing. Drain these with typical async background job into Postgres. The core idea here is that you're separating the concept of the video like count and the concept of one user state with regard to one video.\n\nOnce you get the above working, that's your baseline for what's possible using a simple system.\n\n\\- Deploy your video web project, and look at real world data.\n\n\\- If your traffic is growing so fast that you're going to outgrow your Oxide rack within one quarter or so, then look at vendors such as Redis Enterprise and Upstash, and also look at hiring a software engineer who has skills in scaling social networks and working knowledge of the various Facebook papers and Google papers about upscaling.\n\n\\- You mention below \"offloading this to a tier 2 storage + restoring sounds like a recipe for a synchronization nightmare\". In practice it's easier than it sounds, because it's such a good fit for background batch jobs and eventual consistency.\n\n\\- You mention below how to know if a user has liked a video. Start with your persistent storage e.g. Postgres and using a read-only replica when you build the user-video page or UI/UX. By the way, this is not a single source of truth, strictly speaking, because of database replica limitations (e.g. CAP & PACELC), yet in practice it's close enough to get you started. As above, you can try starting this way, so you can benchmark it. If/when you're approaching capacity limits, such as within one quarter or so, then revisit.",

I concur with the numbers - I've had easy 200K+ results in the past; it's a good baseline. The thing is, if storage exceeds RAM, all hell breaks loose. If this was for counters only, it might be fine (as many keys as videos), but the \"no duplicate likes\" requirement seems to cause memory explosion, because now you have to remember who liked what. It's not just quantitative. I'm already considering some strong Redis-friendly optimizations like \"video IDs and user IDs shall be densely-packed integers with no holes\" - supposedly good old Redis can then use an optimized array-based index for the keys.\n\nI guess my main problem is this: Redis is well-suited for hot data, but it could be hard to justify keeping global state (counts + who liked what) forever, and offloading this to a \"tier 2\" storage + restoring sounds like a recipe for a synchronization nightmare. This is why I immediately jumped to sharding - I assume that I will run out of memory on a single host, so I'd rather plan for it than mitigate in other ways. The alternative, of course, is to splurge on RAM sticks, perhaps run 1 Redis instance per core, and see how many GBs/core we can manage :P\n\n  \nAlso I'm thinking more of a Set-type data structure for the change detection. A List doesn't seem too practical, given how when, say, a new super-popular K-Pop video drops, the same one item is going to be receiving likes all over. It's a niche case, sure, but AFAIK surges like these are normal for video sites like YouTube.\n\n100% finding people who have already solved this in the past would be great. The thing is, this is for an extremely underfunded volunteer project (think: budget = pocket lint), so in this case, the people is me :-|\n\n  \nThanks for mentioning the \"Oxide rack\" - right now, I'm trying to squeeze as much as possible out of truly frugal resources, so buying servers by the rack is not realistic. I have done some minor self-hosted DC work in the past, but this looks promising. Here's hoping the current RAM prices don't throw a monkey wrench in these guys' day-to-day.",

Poll it and use the last known state at all times.\n\nWhat we did that I think was very useful to create a separate thread that polls the device and UI is updated from this thread using signal/slots(we are using Qt, think signal/slots as callback functions but thread safe).\n\n>Commands are async, UI needs to wait/timeout\n\nI found that commands should change the state of the UI to an intermediary state(like Ready -> Processing) and the device should be polled to move UI to the final state(Example: Procesing -> Moving). It is easier if you know the states the device can be in.\n\nDo not do waiting in the UI. Commands are handled in another thread and that thread should update the UI about what is going on.\n\nI never really did web, but AFAIK this is much like MVC, where model is the device, controller is your thread that communicates with the device and view is your GUI.",

          "text": "I've worked on device control systems with web front-ends before.  \n\nExodusTay makes some good points.  100% the device state itself should be the source of truth, and the front-end should reflect that state.\n\nIf you need to update the device from the front-end, you should to tell the controller the new state you want, and have it attempt to update the device, and then sample the state and confirm the change, possibly retrying if necessary.\n\nI would ask some topology questions.  Like, how exactly, is the device controlled?  Are you the authors of the device's connectivity software, or is it a 3rd party, black box situation?  Is the device controller acting as the server or the client?\n\nNetwork client's should be able to detect disconnections and re-connect automatically.\n\nControllers should be designed to anticipate loss of network connectivity and fail safely, maintain the state, follow the schedule, or whatever should happen in the absence of control.\n\nI've done this type of system with node.js running on-premise, presenting as web-server on wifi.\n\nDynamic display of device state changes was done via websocket so that updates could be conveyed to the front-end quickly, and without polling.\n\nThe connectivity of the controlled devices is highly variable.  \n\nBut, if you can choose, node.js makes working with raw sockets easy.  IMO, much less complicated doing networking in C or C++.  \n\nAnd if you can use node.js as the controller, then you can connect to your websocket server as a client - the same way that a web-app running in the browser will connect.  Which basically means you can have a chain of hops over websocket from the controller to the browser, possibly through several client-server layers, including out to the wider internet, if that's a requirement.",
