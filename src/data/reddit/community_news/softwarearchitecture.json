      "text": "Here are presentations that summarize the main content of my book *Architectural Metapatterns* (which is, surprisingly, an overview of architectural patterns):\n\n___\n\n[**Patterns of Patterns**](https://speakerdeck.com/denyspoltorak/patterns-of-patterns-c322149c-fcdd-4df6-8c6c-f273c7ab17dd), and why we need them:\n\n* The misery of having thousands of patterns.\n* Local and distributed architectures are not dissimilar.\n* Structure determines function.\n* There are only so many elementary geometries.\n* Which means that hundreds of patterns condense into several metapatterns.\n\n___\n\n[**Basic Architectures**](https://speakerdeck.com/denyspoltorak/basic-architectures), the building blocks for complex systems:\n\n* *Monolith* – a cohesive codebase.\n* *Shards* – multiple instances of a (sub)system.\n* *Layers* – subdivision by the level of abstractness.\n* *Services* – components, dedicated to subdomains.\n* *Pipeline* – a chain of data processing steps.\n\n… and common variants of each of the architectures.\n\n___\n\n[**Architectural Extensions**](https://speakerdeck.com/denyspoltorak/architectural-extensions-c3e506c0-6472-4e2c-8113-b3d8ffa20d63). Making use of specialized components:\n\n* *Middleware* – communication and deployment.\n* *Shared Repository* – persistence and synchronization.\n* *Proxy* – protocols, routing, and security.\n* *Orchestrator* – integration and use cases.\n* *Combined Component* – multiple aspects.\n\n___\n\n[**Fragmented Architectures**](https://speakerdeck.com/denyspoltorak/fragmented-architectures-bf4d129f-4cd1-46bf-9fb0-248879872b25). Patterns with smaller components:\n\n* *Layered Services* – divide into services, then into layers.\n* *Polyglot Persistence* – employ multiple databases.\n* *Backends for Frontends* (*BFF*) – dedicate a service to each kind of client.\n* *Service-Oriented Architecture* (*SOA*) – divide into layers, then into services.\n* *Hierarchy* – recursive subdivision.\n\n___\n\n[**Implementation Patterns**](https://speakerdeck.com/denyspoltorak/implementation-patterns). The high-level design of system components:\n\n* *Plugins* customize the component’s behavior.\n* *Hexagonal Architecture* isolates the business logic from external dependencies.\n* *Microkernel* mediates between resource providers and resource consumers.\n* *Mesh* maintains a decentralized system.\n\n___\n\nI hope that the presentations will help you quickly find out if you are interested in the book.\n\nMerry Christmas!",

What usually accelerates architects beyond this point is shifting from frameworks to decision making under constraints.\n\nA few things I’ve seen work well in practice:\n\nOne, spend time with architecture decision records and tradeoff analysis, not just views. Writing and defending ADRs forces clarity far more than drawing diagrams. Even lightweight ones.\n\nTwo, study real failure and scaling stories. Postmortems from large platforms, architecture blogs that explain why decisions were made and later reversed. That’s where quality attributes and tradeoffs become concrete.\n\nThree, practice architecture by doing small but end to end designs. Take a real problem at work or a hypothetical one and explicitly walk through requirements, quality attributes, constraints, and decisions. Document it as if you had to convince skeptical stakeholders.\n\nFour, learn to communicate with non architects. The best architects I’ve worked with were excellent translators. They could explain the same system differently to developers, product, ops, and leadership without losing intent.",

BUT - beware in reality nobody wants this level of detail (except for you, and you won't have time to do it exactly to spec), so the most important thing is to adapt the core ideas and produce 'just enough' design and documentation (shout out to George Fairbanks) which caters specifically for your stakeholders. This is truly an art which solidifies your value as an architect if people can find, understand, get value from and contribute to your architecture documentation - if they can't, it's a problem that needs resolving via collaboration and iteration until this becomes possible.\n\nBest of luck",

Did you think soft architect was not a developer role? soft architect is just a staff engineer role. eg at Google we have L1(Junior)-L7(Staff).   \n  \nAnd why would higher level roles die, literally if we look at the market today, the data says otherwise. Everyone is hiring seniors ONLY, staff/architect jobs have a shortage, companies are competing for the same staff engineers as they fire or stop hiring mid level and junior jobs, junior jobs are impossible to land now. More automatable jobs, easy stuff like writing CRUD, graphql APIs can be done by AI, writing to redis, copy paste code from stackoverflow e.t.c while higher level jobs like planning and designing microservice communication, database schema design, the type where context matter and  cannot be done by AI, at least not yet, have the highest demand. Today its hard to find anyone hiring juniors, but everyone is hiring qualified architects/staff engineers.\n\nAnd being a software architect involves more than just \"memorizing a bunch of rules\". Classic Dunning-Kruger Effect. One thing you learn hopefully pretty early, is that there are tradeoffs to every technical decision/implementation. This is precisely the type of role you might never get/fit into if you have not been lucky enough to be exposed to these trade offs at a senior/junior role. You cannot afford to learn on the job, as the costs of bad architectural decisions are super high. You think bringing down production for a day is tough? try managing 6 team's time and salaries for 6 months only to come up with a subpar implementation that you have to scrap. You either have the experience or you do not, there is no room for expensive mistakes. You can read system design all you want, your knowledge will always be theoretical. Architectural decisions require wisdom and exposure. They involve more process level decisions than technical ones. you will often have to communicate with diff teams and map out the organizations leadership structures and chains of responsibility more than you will push code. You need to think about things like hiring for the technical decisions you made, documentation, making it easy for the organization to replace you, telemetry, GDPR and other privacy concerns. I hope you get a chance to work at a senior/staff role where you have to manage deployments, set the standards for other people to follow, and write internal libraries to speed up senior engineers time, then you'll understand",

This can be AI assisted. \n* Governance of architectural decisions (clear why, options, decided approach, etc). Similar to the above, it ensures that you, your peers and AI have correct context.\n\nOnce you have the above, and the governance around it, you can centralise it in e.g. a git repo, and teach your LLM of choice about it. You can use pretty much any provider, but Anthropic models, especially Opus 4.5 (even Sonnet) work great with it.\n\nThis also very much depends on the size, scope and the goals you’re trying to achieve. For more complex setups and tasks, I’d advise getting deep into the ecosystem of skills, MCPs, sub agents, etc.",

      "text": "Browser automation feels like an arms race. A framework like Playwright can leave a fingerprint that bot detectors are built to catch. So I started playing with a different approach: controlling your day-to-day browser.\n\n[What I built](https://github.com/8ta4/see) is a CLI that talks to a browser extension. It uses my browser's fingerprint. The goal is a clean bill of stealth.\n\nBut this approach has its downsides.\n\n- It relies on a companion extension, which adds setup friction. I yak-shaved [a tool](https://github.com/8ta4/extension) to automate installing extensions, so this is a solvable problem.\n\n- It's not built to run at a massive scale. You could spin up a bunch of browsers, but that's not a feature out of the box.\n\n- It lacks the interactivity of other frameworks. As u/Chromix_ pointed out in [another post](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o1u9ia/a_cli_to_scrape_pages_for_agents_by_piggybacking), not moving the mouse or typing could look suspicious. If you want to add that stuff, you have to change the extension's code yourself. That said, it hasn't been a problem in small-scale use so far.\n\n- A script gets access to your logged-in browser. That comes with a whole different set of risks, especially if you hook an LLM up to it.\n\nI put my thinking on this stuff into [a brain dump](https://github.com/8ta4/see/blob/81137f1139d5451cc3a2699f5bf05c804a176860/DONTREADME.md).\n\nWhat other approaches have you found effective for stealthy browser automation?",

There is a ton of malware that only scrapes browser fingerprints, then you purchase them in bulk and run them all across your distributed bot network.\n\nOne area that seems to be in constant struggle is the client environment itself. Emulating human actions in a controlled method is super tricky, and a bot's greatest strength (numbers) is also the way it gets caught (aggregate data).",

Second, ownership is role based, not person based. A queue or rotation beats “ask whoever is around.” Third, escalations are visible by default. A shared board or system that shows status, age, and next action creates pressure without anyone nagging.\n\nIf escalation depends on calls or DMs, it’s already broken. People will always route around friction. The goal is to make the right path the easiest path, and the wrong one annoying enough that it fades out naturally.\n\nMost real improvements come from tightening intake and visibility, not adding more rules.",

I find this to be an issue at larger companies where the only common upper management across teams might be VP level and they aren’t getting involved in these things. So then the solution is some levels of management down the chain need to coordinate and agree and they tend to be in their own worlds at big companies, not focused on coordinating with other directors on processes. \n\nSo all that is to say, it’s real easy in theory, but my experience is it’s hard at big companies where management of all the teams involved are not necessarily tightly synced on processes and their views on enforcing/following them. At smaller companies, the VP of engineering might actually be involved in these things and enforce that the different teams involved actually follow the processes. \n\nJust my experience.

I then populate the labels with some code to scan the objects and append the labels as needed.\n\nYou could also use a jsonb column and index jsonb searches directly.",

This gave me good insight into what was going on and I am able to debug pretty quickly. \n\nAfter this I modified the pipeline to just pass data without saving files and reports so that it can run in a Google Cloud Run instance. This made me lose a lot of my insight into what was actually going on. \n\nHow do people generally debug sw on the cloud? I was thinking about making a core extraction package that is shared locally and with my cloud backend but wanted to hear from you guys what best practices are.\n\nThanks in advance!",

The mistake most people make is treating cloud debugging like local debugging, just without files.\n\nWhat usually works is making observability a first class part of the pipeline. Structured logs at stage boundaries, correlation IDs per document, and small sampled payload snapshots instead of full dumps. You don’t need everything, just enough to reconstruct what happened.\n\nSharing a core extraction package between local and cloud is a solid move. Keep it deterministic and side effect free, then wrap it differently for local inspection versus Cloud Run execution. Locally you can persist artifacts, in the cloud you emit metrics, timings, and selective debug output behind flags.\n\nIn practice, debugging in the cloud becomes less about stepping through code and more about asking “where did this diverge” using logs, metrics, and traces. Once you design for that, you regain most of the visibility you had locally without slowing the pipeline down.",
