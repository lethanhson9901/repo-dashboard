I think a one of the reason might be people \"can't\" comment meaningfully because they don't have enough visibility into the system to know if Option B will break something three services away.

IME decision meetings can get off track and end up purely about the priorities. Especially in orgs where people (leadership incl.) don't read the RFCs in advance of decision meetings. My ideal approach is to approach stakeholders well before the RFC is presented and gather business priorities before exploring any options in an RFC, otherwise it can be a serious waste of time. \n\nI also like to include a list of \"non-priorities\". The latter in particular helped keep conversations on track (assuming we all agreed on them).\n\nI will say, given enough time I think people can gain context but the environment has to allow it. For example if there's a weekly/bi-weekly time blocked for presenting RFCs, each team can assign a representative and ideally that individual is given the time and space to gain the context needed, as questions and leave comments well before the meeting.\n\nIf they're not commenting consistently IMO that may be work environment issue.",

Software Architecture is the stuff that does not change that much over time.\n\nThink of it via the Building analogy. The Architecture Documentation would be the drawings of the facade (which  almost never change), the main blueprint stating where the structural/weight supporting columns/walls are, and guiding principles like windows should be either in the North or the Sourth so the building do not get too hot, or that exit doors to the building must open to the outside. Technical Documentation would be the blueprint with the layout of each floor, including electrical and plumbing.\n\nSo a sequence diagram describing the information flow of a particular Use Case? Not part of the architecture. A sequence diagram showing how any generic interaction between the Web client and the App will work, down to the database and potential cache interactions, without describing any particular implementation? That is part of the architecture.\n\n  \nThat said, in reality most teams just don't care because business don't care and do not want to pay the cost of having good, up-to-date technical documentation. So anything that could automate the generation of said documentation without too much friction will be a welcomed tool.",

Those teams will benefit for documents generated from code. Most other teams will not.\n\nSo if you are evaluating whether to build a tool, make sure (1) it can be run in a CI/CD tool chain to auto-update documents, (2) it is easy to debug and regenerate the documents to fix errors, and (3) recognize that it is producing low value documentation (which means you should not expect a large market value for the product).",

Overcoming the inertia and getting the organization is probably harder than doing the actual work. \n\nIn my case, I fell in love with the C4Model and the way Simon talked about context at different levels and focusing on one thing at a time. But where C4 focused on systems > applications > components > code, I needed something that looked up and not down to the code. The platform I supported is made up of ~250 applications which talked to a middleware platform even larger which talked to the legacy not a mainframe but essentially a mainframe. I needed something that started at the enterprise level like group/locations which contain platforms which host systems made up of applications deployed to different tiers. \n\nSo over the past five years I’ve built a helper system with a SQLite database which tracks my entities and the relationships, an ASP.NET web app which pulls the data from the db and renders dot output which I feed to Graphviz which renders the nodes and edges as an SVG image that I display in the browser which I can then drill up or down levels to change my context and what is displayed. I can then push a modified version of the dot graph into our wiki on to pages for each location / platform / system / tier / application. Oh, and I had someone build a utility which scans our config files to pull any external endpoints on a quarterly basis. I use that output to update my app links in my database. \n\nAnd yes, there are enterprise tools that can do this type of stuff for you but for a variety of reasons it is easier to just entertain myself with this project versus trying to jump through the bureaucracy hoops. But I think the biggest frustration is that so many people look at them and don’t quite get the value of having a canonical taxonomy of our applications and references to/from other applications. For me, when the latest consultant comes in and says we should replace the old SOAP service and it shouldn’t be that hard, I can show them the 30 other apps that call that SOAP service and all the apps that depend on that app. It brings reality into the conversation quickly. Or when our client doesn’t understand why we can’t just move to the cloud, I show a diagram with 200 applications and all of their relationships and interconnectedness and it usually gets quiet.\n\nAnyway, I like what I’ve built. Wish I could share. I know others have built more impressive things. But this scratched an itch I had for a long time.",

At one point the design gets so huge that nobody knows anymore which change in the code requires an update in the design.\n\nI know what people will say now: You are doing it wrong! You should first update the design and then start the implementation! The point is, especially when it is about refactoring (renaming/splitting/introducing new classes, moving methods around etc.) it is much more cumbersome to refactor a \"text\" than it is with actual code where the IDE knows all the dependencies and can trace where methods are called, classes are used and do the update resulting in a consistent state.\n\nMy experience what works out to some extent:\n\n\\- If you really do the design first (prescriptive), then you should be able to generate code or sync your existing code base with it\n\n\\- If you are happy with a design that documents your code (descriptive), then you could e.g. create a script that automatically generates PlantUML diagrams etc. based on your class structure\n\n\\- A good tracing also helps e.g. if you can trace design items to your code base (e.g. by introducing special tags) then everybody should better see where an update is necessary",

Documentation updates can potentially be automated, but still need review.\n\nIf you and your group can maintain the discipline to carry that process out, then the documentation stays more in sync. Practically speaking: between the force to deliver direct value ASAP and people making general mistakes, the drift is inevitable over time.\n\n**Another idea:** Identify which documentation is expected to drift, and treat it as disposable. Maintain the rest, naturally infrequently.\n\nAnother comment had an excellent point that there are architecture docs, and technical docs. Architecture docs should not be expected to change often, and updates to them can be enforced during PR review when the reality of the architecture changes. Technical documentation can be used as a launching pad to communicate ideas and get an implementation started up, but since these implementations can change requirements so often, the documentation might not be worth keeping once the software is written.\n\nSomething like user documentation might be another thing entirely, which could need updates frequently but is also important to keep and maintain; whether that is an external document, an in-application document, guide, or tutorial, or something else. Avoiding duplication of information reduces maintenance needs, but I guess that has to be balanced with formatting information properly for different audiences that need it too.",

          "text": "Disclaimer: the following has been generated with AI, by a prompt I've been working on for over a year, with many biases built-in (over 100 rules and principles). Specifically for your questions I've instructed it specifically to focus on the time dimension of decision making.\n\nHere it goes, as if I worded it, only better (English is not my native language) and properly formatted.\n\n**Architecture is not an engineering standard; it is a derivative function of business intent.**\n\nThe mistake most developers make is trying to validate their designs against \"Best Practices\" or abstract notions of \"Scale.\" A Senior Architect doesn't do that. They validate against the organization's runway.\n\nIf you lack a mentor to review your work, you must simulate this mindset by filtering every decision through the current stage of your company.\n\n### 1. The \"Survival\" Filter (Pre-Product/Market Fit)\nIn this phase, the organization is testing hypotheses. The biggest risk isn't \"system failure\"; it's building the wrong thing efficiently.\n*   **Validation Rule:** Optimize for **Reversibility**.\n*   **The Kafka Decision:** If you ask \"Will Kafka handle the load?\", you are asking the wrong question. The right question is: \"Does the operational tax of running Kafka prevent us from pivoting next month?\"\n*   **Verdict:** Kafka is likely invalid here. It forces structural rigidity. A monolith with a simple Postgres job queue is \"valid\" because it’s easy to delete or change when the business idea fails.\n\n### 2. The \"Sales Promise\" Filter (Growth Phase)\nOnce the business has traction, validation shifts from \"Can we change it?\" to \"Can we honor the contract?\"\n*   **Validation Rule:** Optimize for **The specific promise Sales made.**\n*   **Replica vs. Caching:** Don't choose based on tech blogs. Look at the Service Level Agreement (SLA).\n    *   **Scenario A:** Sales sold a financial reporting tool. The promise is **Accuracy**. Caching is now a liability because stale data breaks the promise. You validate by proving you can scale via Read Replicas (ACID compliance).\n    *   **Scenario B:** Sales sold a social feed. The promise is **Responsiveness**. Stale data is annoying but acceptable. You validate by implementing aggressive Caching (Redis/CDN).\n\n### 3. The \"Fermi\" Filter (The Math Check)\nExperienced engineers rarely guess about load. We use **Fermi Estimation** to prove safety before writing code. This is your strongest tool against \"Imposter Syndrome.\"\n\n**The Calculation:**\nDon't worry about \"Real Production Load\" in the abstract. Calculate it.\n*   **Formula:** `Total Users` × `Daily Active %` × `Requests Per User` ÷ `Seconds in Day`.\n*   **Example:** 100k users. 10% active. 50 clicks each.\n    *   `10,000 users * 50 reqs = 500,000 reqs/day`.\n    *   `500,000 / 86,400 seconds = ~5.7 requests per second`.\n*   **The Validation:** A Raspberry Pi can handle 6 requests per second. You don't need Kubernetes; you need a single VPS. Decision validated.\n\n### 4. The \"Bus Factor\" Filter (Secret Fragility)\nYou asked: *\"Is this architecture fine or secretly fragile?\"*\n\nFragility is rarely about code breaking; it's about **Cognitive Solvency**. The \"cost\" of an architecture is the amount of human memory required to operate it.\n\n*   **The Test:** If you (the architect) are asleep or hit by a bus, can the most junior person on the team fix a critical bug at 3 AM?\n*   **The Trap:** If your \"valid\" architecture requires understanding Event Sourcing, three different message brokers, and a custom sharding layer, it is structurally insolvent for a small team.\n\n**Summary:**\nTo validate early, stop looking for \"correctness.\" Look for alignment.\n*   **Early Stage:** Valid = Reversible.\n*   **Growth Stage:** Valid = Honors the SLA.\n*   **Scale Stage:** Valid = Reduces Cognitive Load per developer.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've seen more startups die from over-engineering \"Google-scale\" solutions for zero users than from their servers melting down. Build for the problem you have right now.",

As per another comment, it's just a way of moving data around.\n\nEvent sourcing is when your actual source of truth is a list of events rather than a traditional relational model, and the only way to reason about the current state of your data is to replay those events and aggregate them into a meaningful model (which is usually snapshotted at regularly intervals to save you having to replay every event from the start of time just to run simple queries against your data). It's inspired by accounting ledgers, and typically paired with CQRS, which means different consumers of your events can do their own aggregation and maintain their own \"projections\".\n\nIn its most purist form, this is often not a great fit for a lot of problem spaces, so a lot of real-world systems are built on hybrid architectures instead, meaning they adopt parts of event sourcing, but the system of record remains a traditional database.",

I want to build a baseline that actually reveals the architectural health and stability of the platform.\n\nI have been reading several blog posts like [this](https://raygun.com/blog/server-performance-metrics/). but I know theory often diverges from reality, so I wanted to get different perspectives from the community.\n\nIf you were auditing a system from scratch and could only pick a handful of metrics to determine if the architecture is sound (or burning down), what would be on your \"Must-Have\" list?\n\nThanks for sharing your wisdom!",

What has worked well for me in my last projects is designing around a few simple questions instead of a giant grid of graphs like \"are we slower than we should be\", and if so, \"what are we waiting on?\", etc, shift our perspective a bit as software engineers\n\nWhen responses start stretching, the service you're staring at usually isn't the real problem, it's waiting on something else like a database call, a cache lookup, another internal service, some external API or dependency. That's why if you can see how a request's time is actually broken down across those hops you can pinpoint where the issue is, which is why we even bother with this observability stuff in the first place.\n\nOn my projects I care a lot about knowing how close we are to an actual bottleneck so I can sleep at night, because a service can sit at 70-80% and be perfectly stable,what worries me is when utilization is high and you see in-flight requests climbing, connection pools filling up, queue depth increasing and latency starting to stretch under the same load. This is the combination that usually means you're no longer just \"busy\", you're hitting a constraint somewehre and the system is starting to amplify it. From an architectural standpoint, that's a very different signal than a box that's simply working hard.\n\nIf I were doing this from scratch, I'd optimize for direction. When something feels off, you should be able to open a dashboard and quickly answer \"are users actually slower\", \"which layer stretched first\", and \"what is it waiting on\"? If your setup makes those answers obvious, you're in good shape. You can also add facts to the questions list that ensure your system is healthy, think of it as conditions and targets that the system always needs to behave and achieve otherwise probably something's off, that's why it's hard to simply give you a set of questions, a lot of it is also thinking around your project's business model so you can have a strategy that makes more sense, at least in terms of priority when you're just starting\n\nI very recently helped write an article that walks through a concrete example of this approach if you want to take a look (it focuses a lot on setting stuff up but the mental flow in there should help you a bit in the process of creating the list of questions you're looking for)\n\n[https://arg-software.medium.com/how-we-debug-slow-microservices-in-18-minutes-not-4-hours-a-prometheus-opentelemetry-guide-0d7b551d1722](https://arg-software.medium.com/how-we-debug-slow-microservices-in-18-minutes-not-4-hours-a-prometheus-opentelemetry-guide-0d7b551d1722)\n\nThe article is obviously only one slice of observability, it can go much deeper.

Though I don't doubt that some companies would be better off if they used a formula.\n\nArchitecture is the phenomena of two or more systems interacting with eachother. This could be modules within an application, two independent services, or two massive tech companies linking together.\n\nArchitecture happens whether or not an architect is present. Architects are masters of this phenomena, and understand how systems behave in a given environment.\n\nSo a couple of things here:\n1) Being a good architect means understanding your environment, constraints, and problem space.\n2) Improving this requires more knowledge and experience in seeing how different systems interact. Not just technology, but people systems as well.\n3) It is very difficult to get solid architectural experience from a tutorial, course, or book. So much of the work is hands on and in the weeds.\n4) The variations on each of the factors in the real world are immense. Most architects specialize in atleast an industry. Retail, SaaS, FinTech, MedTech, etc.\n5) Look at the pinned megathread for more resources if you want to keep learning, but lived experience will always be better.

Perhaps also accompanied by deliberate learning.\n\nYou **could** set yourself up by at least learning about the things you should be aware of. It seems you're already thinking about architectural characteristics, which is good, but I invite you to also consider things beyond tech: the business as a whole.\n\nPersonally, I benefited quite a bit from picking up some business analysis and project management skills, like going through Eliyahu Goldratt's literature or TOGAF. TOGAF in specific is super overkill for any project I ever worked on, but learning about it and its concepts - which cover enterprise in general, way beyond IT - helped me have a more holistic view to interpret business situations and come up with software solutions that actually fit the businesses I work with.\n\nKind of a random idea, and it's something I try to **not** do to avoid working for free, but could be useful if you just want to practice the muscle: Go through a list of RFPs or software development project posts and see what you can come up with for how you'd approach a system based on what the business person says on the post/specs. You could probably also find similar exercises online and compare them with the answers. I find myself consulting AWS's architecture blog posts more and more often nowadays, e.g. this one: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/building-a-third-party-saas-metering-and-billing-integration-on-aws/ (I was building something similar, then compared it against what they were doing to learn new things)",

If you read about modular design, you gonna see there's no \"contract layer\" (you asked for modular design, not layered architecture after all). \n\nIn practice, in lean design (as opposite to enterprise designs), there are two common cases are:\n\n1. Module A delegates its infrastructure code to Module A'. In such case module A defines all the interfaces, and module A' implements them. Example: \"DeviceRegistration\" and \"DeviceRegistration - Infrastructure\" modules. This way \"DeviceRegistration\" has no infra code and doesn't depend on the \"DeviceRegistration - Infrastructure\".\n\n2. Module A needs to delegate flow to Module B. In such case there is a direct dependency, and no amount of tricks with separate abstraction layer won't change it. Put the interfaces in the upstream module, and let downstream module implement them. It the flow is unidirectional, direct dependency between modules, where you invoke classes of the mobule B is fine. It could be as easy as exposing a Facade Pattern. \n\nI was many Java or C# implementations with many abstraction layers, but I think that in the end it's Go that nailed it. It's even built-in into its philosophy by \"consumers to define interfaces instead of producers\" mantra.",

          "text": "Your question is correct, you are overcomplicating it.\n\nBehaviors, functions, and requirements are not sequential steps but viewpoints of the same thing.\n\nIn software, we create systems that are n-dimensional in nature. It is a simple structure of logical components, but behavior and requirements (among many other things) are all constructs humans layer on top of the logical components to make sense of it all. It exists detached and purely for our benefit, so that we may design more elegant software systems. The software itself doesn't benefit from behavior analysis or architectural fitness or performance... It just *does*. Same as with Systems Engineering.\n\nSo, separating the real from the imagined we can see that the behavior of a system is one viewpoint we would design. The requirements is another synonym of behavior, but a subset of behaviors that is strictly required. Non-functional requirements are still required, just harder for stakeholders to articulate. Things that if catastrophe arrived, the stakeholders would say 'of course I want that!' Do they want it reasonably performant? Do they want it to be observed so errors are clear and remedies quickly? Do they want failover in case a data center goes out?\n\nAll that to say, your perception of a sequential flow of designing a software intensive system is incorrect.\n\n1) Start with functional requirements\n2) Add non-functional requirements\n3) Identify True Constraints (versus imagined constraints)\n4) Decide what to optimize for, in pursuit of the larger goal\n5) Use comfortable tools & techniques to design your system\n6) Use the previous 5 steps as a guide to redesign what you just made, but to be easily manufactured (coded, released, maintained, and deprecated)",

      "text": "Working on something yet to launch and would like thoughts / opinions.\n\nIt is a product that companies would use in managing their employees with various features.\n\n**What I want (I think):** \n\n* Use Firebase to offload authentication but not have it be the source of truth (easier to migrate off if we ever need to / don't want to rely too much on external platforms within reason). \n* Use JWT to not have to handle sessions / not have to hit DB to check perms before api calls.\n* Pre-defined roles that ship out of the box they assign to employees that by default allow chunks of permissions . \n* Ability for specific employees to be allowed to do things that not default to those roles (and individually being blocked from something otherwise allowed by that role by default). \n* Ability for companies to modify what permissions come by default for specific roles.\n\nAn example permission I am thinking is `ProductAreaA.FeatureA.Read.Own` (thinking 'any'/'own' and 'none' for explicit blocking of a feature).  \n  \nSo far the options I've thought through all have drawbacks but the only way I see above working is:  \n  \n**Storage:**\n\n1. `user` table column for their `role_id` which is also synced onto their firebase custom claims\n2. `user_permissions` table for each thing an individual is allowed / not allowed to do (mostly updated when role is changed but also when a company customizes their permissions beyond/limiting from their role) \n3. When `user_permissions` is modified first update custom claim in firebase that has a bitfield mapping of permissions (if fail don't update `user_permissions`).\n\n**Storage Challenge:** This would mean then if say a company changes the default permissions of `admin` role all the firebase custom claim permission bitfield maps + the `user_permissions` table needs updated for all their users. This feels clunky but possible (offloading the firebase updates on login callback and general DB updates on the api call to change defaults for the role).\n\n**Using:**   \nOn api call check JWT for:\n\n1. explicit allow of feature\n2. then explicit blocking of feature\n3. finally if none of the above, if default-allowed by their `role_id`\n\n\\-------------\n\n**Am I being dumb here?**  A few times I've picked up and dropped thinking about this and gone back to feature work because I can't shake the feeling I've missed something obvious. Perhaps it all is just too over-complicated and I need to just lose the nice to have granular access control and just accept vanilla RBAC.... **What would you do?**",

Tenant admin has all roles including 'roles:manage' with a '*:*' perm. Admin can grant 'roles:manage' to others, but they can only grant roles they have. (I also have approvals optional)\n\nI split the permissions up as resource, action columns and these are in the database as standard system defined permissions.  Most resources have an admin action \"*\", so any new actions are automatically included, but not included for users that have specific role actions.  This keeps adding new features sane in regards to permissions and avoids accidental grants.\n\nAllow users to have several roles, combine/uniq the role permissions of all those roles and shove them in the JWT they get on login. The JWT can get a bit long, but you can swap out the long strings for a lookup table that all apps have as a constant so the code is clear. (profile:read,write,etc -> p:rwe)\n\nAs far as individual privileges for specific resources (by id), you could go with an ACL override, but I have designed things to not need that (yet).",
