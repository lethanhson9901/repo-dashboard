I finally went to my manager to complain that I was doing all the work, that others weren’t contributing much, and their unfinished tasks were constantly being pushed onto my plate. His response was pretty blunt: he said that’s just the reality of corporate life, especially in IT, where only about 30% of the team actually contributes to the project. I’m wondering if this is still a common, accepted truth in the industry?",

          "text": "As much as it may sound like Pareto Principle but it is not. Pareto Principle is about systems and their interconnections. Your manager saying this is wrong assumption on human capability.\n\nThe situation you describe is a case of bad management and bad assimilation of knowledge. The bad management because they have failed to build proper performance culture and haven't been able to incentivize teams/people to finish the projects or tasks. The bad assimilation of knowledge in team because likely the case that people are not possessing enough knowledge about the system to get the projects to the finish line.\n\nYour manager is just normalizing bad management and cloaking it with some misunderstood principle. Remember that Pareto is about explaining the natural uneven distribution within the system and not about the uneven distribution of work within the group of people. One classic example is \"Google Search and Ads\" is 70% of Google revenue (uneven earning compared to other services but can be explained by Pareto Principles) but that doesn't mean their Android or Cloud teams are useless.\n\nConsider this situation as a first red flag. There are ways to measure organization's health. If you see more red flags, it is time that you leave that place immediately.",

Frequent breaks and clocking out exactly on time blah blah blah will rather quickly put you on the non-value side because people are looking to you to set the pace.  If you slow down, they'll get worse. \n\nSo instead what you do is look to improve team performance via process.  Look at metrics.  Invent them if necessary.  Hey involved in methodological comparisons.  Give XP a close look.  Look to improve team accountability.  If you can improve the teams' productivity even a little bit you can then try to evade burnout.  You won't always be able to, especially when you're personal life hands you emergencies right around crunch times.\n\nOn your side, look into mental disciplines like stoicism.  Don't laugh, it's helped me.  My next trick is getting into yoga.  Software creation the highest levels does take a toll on your body and mine doesn't quite handle the physical stress like it did thirty years ago when I was getting started.\n\nThe more you try to embrace process improvements the more you'll be pulled into leadership, sales, staffing, and non-technical type of roles.  I've pushed back on this for years but I'm finally at the age where I feel like I have nothing left to prove in the technical arena.  Like I said I'm on my final project as an architect/tech lead, and starting to make that transition.  I'll be a hobbyist again, and I think I'll be able to really enjoy writing software just for fun again like I did as a kid. \n\nThis isn't the answer you're looking for probably but I've had a pretty fulfilling career, including the burnout parts.  I hope it helps.",

And you know what? This normal work life balance and equal contributions were the things that were organized by a team lead and a manager, it is literally their job to organize processes in a team, pick people capable for equal consistent performance and handle these issues. So you are just working in a mismanaged place with delusional management.\n\nTrust me, as soon as you obtain health issues due to overwork and stress, and will be unable to perform as good, you will be replaced in this company in a heartbeat.

As a security practitioner, I need to be aware of projects, and have my own items to check off, but don't contribute to what most people think of as the project.  The same is true of operations and support roles, depending on exactly how the definitions fall.  They are there to receive information, and perhaps steer things a bit, but don't contribute to the execution of the project directly, they just make sure the exit criteria are met so that they can do their jobs once it is launched.\n\nThat is very different than having tasks assigned to others moved to you when they are not completed by the original assignee.  That is a management problem.  If those persons work for your manager, they should be held directly accountable for delivery.  If they work for other teams, it could be performance that your manager should address with theirs, or it could be poor project planning/management.  If that person's supervisor was not made aware of the workload of the project, and agreed to it before it got started, then it is not surprising that other tasks for their team might be preventing them from completing the ones for this project.  This is one of the biggest failures I've seen in project management, grabbing someone, particularly SMEs, for a project, but never getting their boss's agreement, so they don't have the time to do what the project wants. \"Matrix organizations\" are famous for that, in the end, you can't really serve more than one master.

Making use of specialized components:\n\n* *Middleware* – communication and deployment.\n* *Shared Repository* – persistence and synchronization.\n* *Proxy* – protocols, routing, and security.\n* *Orchestrator* – integration and use cases.\n* *Combined Component* – multiple aspects.\n\n___\n\n[**Fragmented Architectures**](https://speakerdeck.com/denyspoltorak/fragmented-architectures-bf4d129f-4cd1-46bf-9fb0-248879872b25). Patterns with smaller components:\n\n* *Layered Services* – divide into services, then into layers.\n* *Polyglot Persistence* – employ multiple databases.\n* *Backends for Frontends* (*BFF*) – dedicate a service to each kind of client.\n* *Service-Oriented Architecture* (*SOA*) – divide into layers, then into services.\n* *Hierarchy* – recursive subdivision.\n\n___\n\n[**Implementation Patterns**](https://speakerdeck.com/denyspoltorak/implementation-patterns). The high-level design of system components:\n\n* *Plugins* customize the component’s behavior.\n* *Hexagonal Architecture* isolates the business logic from external dependencies.\n* *Microkernel* mediates between resource providers and resource consumers.\n* *Mesh* maintains a decentralized system.\n\n___\n\nI hope that the presentations will help you quickly find out if you are interested in the book.\n\nMerry Christmas!",

Writing and defending ADRs forces clarity far more than drawing diagrams. Even lightweight ones.\n\nTwo, study real failure and scaling stories. Postmortems from large platforms, architecture blogs that explain why decisions were made and later reversed. That’s where quality attributes and tradeoffs become concrete.\n\nThree, practice architecture by doing small but end to end designs. Take a real problem at work or a hypothetical one and explicitly walk through requirements, quality attributes, constraints, and decisions. Document it as if you had to convince skeptical stakeholders.\n\nFour, learn to communicate with non architects. The best architects I’ve worked with were excellent translators. They could explain the same system differently to developers, product, ops, and leadership without losing intent.",

BUT - beware in reality nobody wants this level of detail (except for you, and you won't have time to do it exactly to spec), so the most important thing is to adapt the core ideas and produce 'just enough' design and documentation (shout out to George Fairbanks) which caters specifically for your stakeholders. This is truly an art which solidifies your value as an architect if people can find, understand, get value from and contribute to your architecture documentation - if they can't, it's a problem that needs resolving via collaboration and iteration until this becomes possible.\n\nBest of luck",

Did you think soft architect was not a developer role? soft architect is just a staff engineer role. eg at Google we have L1(Junior)-L7(Staff).   \n  \nAnd why would higher level roles die, literally if we look at the market today, the data says otherwise. Everyone is hiring seniors ONLY, staff/architect jobs have a shortage, companies are competing for the same staff engineers as they fire or stop hiring mid level and junior jobs, junior jobs are impossible to land now. More automatable jobs, easy stuff like writing CRUD, graphql APIs can be done by AI, writing to redis, copy paste code from stackoverflow e.t.c while higher level jobs like planning and designing microservice communication, database schema design, the type where context matter and  cannot be done by AI, at least not yet, have the highest demand. Today its hard to find anyone hiring juniors, but everyone is hiring qualified architects/staff engineers.\n\nAnd being a software architect involves more than just \"memorizing a bunch of rules\". Classic Dunning-Kruger Effect. One thing you learn hopefully pretty early, is that there are tradeoffs to every technical decision/implementation. This is precisely the type of role you might never get/fit into if you have not been lucky enough to be exposed to these trade offs at a senior/junior role. You cannot afford to learn on the job, as the costs of bad architectural decisions are super high. You think bringing down production for a day is tough? try managing 6 team's time and salaries for 6 months only to come up with a subpar implementation that you have to scrap. You either have the experience or you do not, there is no room for expensive mistakes. You can read system design all you want, your knowledge will always be theoretical. Architectural decisions require wisdom and exposure. They involve more process level decisions than technical ones. you will often have to communicate with diff teams and map out the organizations leadership structures and chains of responsibility more than you will push code. You need to think about things like hiring for the technical decisions you made, documentation, making it easy for the organization to replace you, telemetry, GDPR and other privacy concerns. I hope you get a chance to work at a senior/staff role where you have to manage deployments, set the standards for other people to follow, and write internal libraries to speed up senior engineers time, then you'll understand",

Then you create bounded contexts, make up the core business rules, define an ubiquitous language, think about how to integrate different bounded contexts (e.g. events, ACLs) and once you start diving into what you've been looking at here, that's where the DDD design phase actually already ended and you are basically \"implementing\" it with a specific software architecture. And that's where ports and adapters (hexagonal architecture) often come in, because you want the domain model independent from frameworks and storage. The often used SAGA pattern is also as a concern of implementation that fullfills DDD constraints, but isn't part of the DDD itself.",

The terms are actually quite ambiguous, I just remembered a page where this kind of stuff was elaborated on this way:\n\n>Applications that follow the Dependency Inversion Principle as well as the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles tend to arrive at a similar architecture. This architecture has gone by many names over the years. One of the first names was Hexagonal Architecture, followed by Ports-and-Adapters. More recently, it's been cited as the [Onion Architecture](https://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/) or [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html). The latter name, Clean Architecture, is used as the name for this architecture in this e-book.\n\n>\\[...\\]\n\n>Clean architecture puts the business logic and application model at the center of the application. Instead of having business logic depend on data access or other infrastructure concerns, this dependency is inverted: infrastructure and implementation details depend on the Application Core. This functionality is achieved by defining abstractions, or interfaces, in the Application Core, which are then implemented by types defined in the Infrastructure layer. A common way of visualizing this architecture is to use a series of concentric circles, similar to an onion. Figure 5-7 shows an example of this style of architectural representation.",

When I tried something similar (convincing a customer that is), I have benefited from turning this around. There was no Point for me convincing anyone. It was more beneficial to explore why DDD might be helpful with what we suffer with (measurable). So first, I had to explore what I struggle with and if DDD might be worth it over other solutions that are faster, easier, cheaper or more accepted by my fellow engineers. Like writing an ADR and challenge the options by your Team. This was a more open aproach than trying to convince someone (which was my first Impuls als well).\n\nIt also helped me to understand the difference between strategical and tactical DDD to see why clean architecture is just ohne way  to do domain centric implemtation. The DDD-crew repo might be a good Point to picture this. See: [https://github.com/ddd-crew/ddd-starter-modelling-process](https://github.com/ddd-crew/ddd-starter-modelling-process)\n\nWhile clean architecture is good to close the architecture Code gap, it is not always beneficial. I guess you know most of this, as you have mentioned with the silver bullet. But this Point did only driven into my brain once I really started working with it. But I still prefer clean architecture whenever it is reasonable. I simply have a new measure for what is reasonable.\n\nI recoment \"learing Domain driven Design\" from vlad khononov to learn DDD itself. Or rather, to visit a good course to discuss this with others who try to lear this and a teacher who is stuck with you.",

Users search by city, dates, and room configuration, and I return a list of hotels with prices, similar to Google Hotels or Booking.\n\nI currently have around 3 million hotels stored in PostgreSQL with full static metadata (name, city, star rating, facilities, coordinates, and so on). Pricing, however, is fully dynamic and only comes from external supplier APIs. I can’t know the price until I call the supplier with specific dates and occupancy.\n\n**Goal**\n\n* Expose a fast, stateless, paginated `/search` endpoint.\n* Support sorting (price, rating) and filtering (stars, facilities).\n* Minimize real-time supplier calls, since they are slow, rate-limited, and expensive.\n\n**Core problem**  \nIf I only fetch real-time prices for, say, 20 hotels per page, how do I accurately sort or filter the full result set? For example, “show the cheapest hotel among 10,000 hotels in Dubai.”  \nCalling suppliers for all hotels on every search is not feasible due to cost, latency, and reliability.\n\n**Current ideas**\n\n1. Cache prices per hotel, date, and occupancy in Redis with a TTL of around 30–60 minutes. Use cached or estimated prices in search results, and only call suppliers in real time on the hotel detail page.\n2. Pre-warm caches for popular routes and date ranges (for example, Dubai or Paris for the next month) using background jobs.\n3. Restrict search-time sorting and filtering to what’s possible with cached or static data:\n   * Sort by cached price.\n   * Filter by stars and facilities.\n   * Avoid filters that require real-time data, such as free cancellation.\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. How do large platforms like Booking or Expedia actually approach this? Do they rely on cached or estimated prices in search results and only fetch real rates on the detail page?\n2. What’s a reasonable caching strategy for highly dynamic pricing?\n   * Typical TTLs?\n   * How do you handle volatility or last-minute price changes?\n   * Is ML-based price prediction commonly used when the cache is stale?\n3. How is sorting implemented without pricing every hotel? Is it common to price a larger subset (for example, the top 500–1,000 hotels) and sort only within that set?\n4. Any advice on data modeling? Should cached prices live in Redis only, PostgreSQL, or a dedicated pricing service?\n5. What common pitfalls should I watch out for, especially around stale prices and user trust?\n\n**Stack**\n\n* NestJS with TypeScript\n* PostgreSQL (PostGIS for location queries)\n* Redis for caching\n* Multiple external supplier APIs, called asynchronously\n\nI’ve read a lot about metasearch architectures at a high level, but I haven’t found concrete details on how large systems handle pricing and sorting together at scale.

Product design has to make hard decisions like this and account for it.\n\n2. I don’t know what the landscape looks like in this industry but there are probably change FEEDs that brokers connect to. So instead of repeated polling and caching, they just listen to events that notify of price changes. This gives them near real time data.\n\n3. Brokers set their own prices.

Full text search, filtering on any combination of fields, sorting on many combinations of fields, relevant scoring, etc; these cannot use normal btree style indexes. Search engines are build from the ground up to support these queries, along with being very easy to scale horizontally.\n\n2. **Separation of concerns**:  Good architecture is about risk mitigation, organizational alignment, and enablement for future features.  Having a separate search engine supports all of these values.  Granted OP sounds like they're building alone in their basement so they may want to optimize for 'fast to build' over 'good' and that's fine. But for public guidance I'm going going to optimize my comments for 'good' :).",

First, they make escalation entry structured. If required inputs aren’t there, the escalation literally can’t be raised. That removes back and forth and Slack chasing. Second, ownership is role based, not person based. A queue or rotation beats “ask whoever is around.” Third, escalations are visible by default. A shared board or system that shows status, age, and next action creates pressure without anyone nagging.\n\nIf escalation depends on calls or DMs, it’s already broken. People will always route around friction. The goal is to make the right path the easiest path, and the wrong one annoying enough that it fades out naturally.\n\nMost real improvements come from tightening intake and visibility, not adding more rules.",

You need actual standardized forms/templates and enforce they are filled out between handoffs as evidence. But if someone at the top isn’t enforcing people follow it, no one will. Or some will, but it doesn’t work if some don’t follow it. I find this to be an issue at larger companies where the only common upper management across teams might be VP level and they aren’t getting involved in these things. So then the solution is some levels of management down the chain need to coordinate and agree and they tend to be in their own worlds at big companies, not focused on coordinating with other directors on processes. \n\nSo all that is to say, it’s real easy in theory, but my experience is it’s hard at big companies where management of all the teams involved are not necessarily tightly synced on processes and their views on enforcing/following them. At smaller companies, the VP of engineering might actually be involved in these things and enforce that the different teams involved actually follow the processes. \n\nJust my experience. I’m sure some larger companies have their shit together, but I haven’t seen it myself.",

For example, we might decide that we're building a monolithic golang app with a postgres database, or we might decide that we're building a set of typescript microservices that will run as cloudflare workers. Those decisions will lead to very different constraints in future.\n\nSoftware architecture as a _process_ is the practices we employ to make those hard-to-change decisions. We ideally make those decisions by gathering the functional and non-functional requirements, understanding the constraints, and then making choices that satisfy all our constraints while providing maximum optionality for the future, ie, the ability to change our minds when we realise we got it wrong.\n\nSystem design is ... designing a system... I guess it's possible to design a system without considering the constraints or the ability to change our minds, but I would still call that \"doing architecture\", just doing it badly.\n\nA software architect is someone who leads that process of making decisions and builds consensus and understanding with teams so that everyone is on the same page about the decisions they're making, and the reasons for choosing those decisions.\n\nI think you're looking for clear definitions for things, but that's not how human endeavours work.

So I started playing with a different approach: controlling your day-to-day browser.\n\n[What I built](https://github.com/8ta4/see) is a CLI that talks to a browser extension. It uses my browser's fingerprint. The goal is a clean bill of stealth.\n\nBut this approach has its downsides.\n\n- It relies on a companion extension, which adds setup friction. I yak-shaved [a tool](https://github.com/8ta4/extension) to automate installing extensions, so this is a solvable problem.\n\n- It's not built to run at a massive scale. You could spin up a bunch of browsers, but that's not a feature out of the box.\n\n- It lacks the interactivity of other frameworks. As u/Chromix_ pointed out in [another post](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o1u9ia/a_cli_to_scrape_pages_for_agents_by_piggybacking), not moving the mouse or typing could look suspicious. If you want to add that stuff, you have to change the extension's code yourself. That said, it hasn't been a problem in small-scale use so far.\n\n- A script gets access to your logged-in browser. That comes with a whole different set of risks, especially if you hook an LLM up to it.\n\nI put my thinking on this stuff into [a brain dump](https://github.com/8ta4/see/blob/81137f1139d5451cc3a2699f5bf05c804a176860/DONTREADME.md).\n\nWhat other approaches have you found effective for stealthy browser automation?",

There is a ton of malware that only scrapes browser fingerprints, then you purchase them in bulk and run them all across your distributed bot network.\n\nOne area that seems to be in constant struggle is the client environment itself. Emulating human actions in a controlled method is super tricky, and a bot's greatest strength (numbers) is also the way it gets caught (aggregate data).",

Once you have multiple agents acting asynchronously across time, tools, and domains, relying on “they’ll write a plan and follow it” stops working. Not because they can’t — but because no one else can inspect, replay, or reason about why something happened later.\nThat’s where governance matters: not as discipline, but as infrastructure. Making intent, assumptions, and success criteria first-class artifacts so decisions remain legible after the fact.\nIn other words, agency without governance isn’t worse than people — it’s worse than people at scale.",

The mistake most people make is treating cloud debugging like local debugging, just without files.\n\nWhat usually works is making observability a first class part of the pipeline. Structured logs at stage boundaries, correlation IDs per document, and small sampled payload snapshots instead of full dumps. You don’t need everything, just enough to reconstruct what happened.\n\nSharing a core extraction package between local and cloud is a solid move. Keep it deterministic and side effect free, then wrap it differently for local inspection versus Cloud Run execution. Locally you can persist artifacts, in the cloud you emit metrics, timings, and selective debug output behind flags.\n\nIn practice, debugging in the cloud becomes less about stepping through code and more about asking “where did this diverge” using logs, metrics, and traces. Once you design for that, you regain most of the visibility you had locally without slowing the pipeline down.",

You can try patching window, globalThis and other global objects to prevent access but you cannot do it reliably across multiple plugins.\n\nIf security is paramount, then you have two choices. Put all the external/plugin scripts into a web worker or load them via invisible iframe. Then, you can use the post message API to communicate back and forth.\n\nAlso note that Figma is quite a sophisticated system. It has its own canvas based renderer and doesn't really use DOM, so they can control the API surface.",

Lots of tools and companies use that, easiest way to achieve it is to minify your code. It usually adds the self-invoking scope around it, on top it obfuscates the code itself (which cannot be protected from viewing).\n\nOtherwise maybe a service worker or web component.\n\nGood luck!",
