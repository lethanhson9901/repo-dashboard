I finally went to my manager to complain that I was doing all the work, that others weren’t contributing much, and their unfinished tasks were constantly being pushed onto my plate. His response was pretty blunt: he said that’s just the reality of corporate life, especially in IT, where only about 30% of the team actually contributes to the project.

Your manager saying this is wrong assumption on human capability.\n\nThe situation you describe is a case of bad management and bad assimilation of knowledge. The bad management because they have failed to build proper performance culture and haven't been able to incentivize teams/people to finish the projects or tasks. The bad assimilation of knowledge in team because likely the case that people are not possessing enough knowledge about the system to get the projects to the finish line.\n\nYour manager is just normalizing bad management and cloaking it with some misunderstood principle. Remember that Pareto is about explaining the natural uneven distribution within the system and not about the uneven distribution of work within the group of people. One classic example is \"Google Search and Ads\" is 70% of Google revenue (uneven earning compared to other services but can be explained by Pareto Principles) but that doesn't mean their Android or Cloud teams are useless.\n\nConsider this situation as a first red flag. There are ways to measure organization's health. If you see more red flags, it is time that you leave that place immediately.",

Frequent breaks and clocking out exactly on time blah blah blah will rather quickly put you on the non-value side because people are looking to you to set the pace.  If you slow down, they'll get worse. \n\nSo instead what you do is look to improve team performance via process.  Look at metrics.  Invent them if necessary.  Hey involved in methodological comparisons.  Give XP a close look.  Look to improve team accountability.  If you can improve the teams' productivity even a little bit you can then try to evade burnout.  You won't always be able to, especially when you're personal life hands you emergencies right around crunch times.\n\nOn your side, look into mental disciplines like stoicism.  Don't laugh, it's helped me.  My next trick is getting into yoga.  Software creation the highest levels does take a toll on your body and mine doesn't quite handle the physical stress like it did thirty years ago when I was getting started.\n\nThe more you try to embrace process improvements the more you'll be pulled into leadership, sales, staffing, and non-technical type of roles.  I've pushed back on this for years but I'm finally at the age where I feel like I have nothing left to prove in the technical arena.  Like I said I'm on my final project as an architect/tech lead, and starting to make that transition.  I'll be a hobbyist again, and I think I'll be able to really enjoy writing software just for fun again like I did as a kid. \n\nThis isn't the answer you're looking for probably but I've had a pretty fulfilling career, including the burnout parts.  I hope it helps.",

As a security practitioner, I need to be aware of projects, and have my own items to check off, but don't contribute to what most people think of as the project.  The same is true of operations and support roles, depending on exactly how the definitions fall.  They are there to receive information, and perhaps steer things a bit, but don't contribute to the execution of the project directly, they just make sure the exit criteria are met so that they can do their jobs once it is launched.\n\nThat is very different than having tasks assigned to others moved to you when they are not completed by the original assignee.  That is a management problem.  If those persons work for your manager, they should be held directly accountable for delivery.  If they work for other teams, it could be performance that your manager should address with theirs, or it could be poor project planning/management.  If that person's supervisor was not made aware of the workload of the project, and agreed to it before it got started, then it is not surprising that other tasks for their team might be preventing them from completing the ones for this project.  This is one of the biggest failures I've seen in project management, grabbing someone, particularly SMEs, for a project, but never getting their boss's agreement, so they don't have the time to do what the project wants. \"Matrix organizations\" are famous for that, in the end, you can't really serve more than one master.

All of these initiatives allowed us to gradually grow and replace functionality that the old system used to do for us.\n\n\nEventually, the new system was just doing everything, so we started writing some of our new business straight to it and also making it the source of truth for others. Once the migration was complete, the old system was just out of the loop entirely and we'd managed to do the whole thing with only a couple of brief outages (which was an improvement over the old system's reliability.)\n\n\nI think the approach that works will be unique to your situation, for us we had a lot of data in the old system that was timestamped fairly well, and we had a very clear design for how the new system was going to model this data. I don't hear about people doing incremental migrations like this much, but it turned out to be the entire backbone of our entire approach.",

(Still, it's worth reporting/marking that some of the data is clearly wrong or in a very poor state.)\n\nAt a large enough size and with enough exposure to the real world, all systems accumulate incorrect data, and whether or not it's worth the effort to find and correct it is a business decision based on cost-benefit, not just an engineering one.",

Examples: apache nifi to route and potentially duplicate data; SQL COALESCE to select from new system vs old system; views to map the legacy amd new type of data - be ready to remove these once they're not used any more; CDC to feed legacy data into the new database during the transition (per use case) phase - while still having a single source of truth - so employ COALESCE tactically \n\nThat last point is key: you can juggle with confidence the steps while planning ahead, and removing the helper infrastructure or code you don't use any more\n\nThis is largely what I call \"front door Strangler pattern\".\n\nThere is also a \"back door Strangler\" in which you extract code in legacy, which is stateless (for example some calculations, business processes) and design it in a way fit for the new application, but use it for confirmation in the legacy first. This is best for business critical code.\n\nGenerally: plan to write code and glue things together, just to throw them away in 1-2 years.\n\nMake sure that stakeholders know it can take a couple number of years. Was it developed over 20 years? It will take 5-8 years to fully replace.\n\nTechnically at a very high level: it's all about inputs and outputs.\n\nThat is: shape of data (name of fields etc) and flow of data.",

The dependent technologies (in our case, Auth-Auth). With each step, we added as few new features as we could, just adding parallel features then moving that community over to the new UX and components. \n\nBoth *could* run side by side but rarely did. Usually we’d launch a set of features for a community and then move that community over.

Since the web-UI could encapsulate several steps the Java code sent multiple command sequences to the old command processor. Fortunately these were well defined and there was an “escape now” sequence that we could use to start over if things got confused. \n\nThe company was very risk averse so we ran with the old system as the system-of-record for several months checking the output against the new system until we switched and had the new system be be system-of-record for several more months. Eventually the customer was happy with the output and we turned off the feed to the old command processor and they could retire the mainframe.

This architecture has gone by many names over the years. One of the first names was Hexagonal Architecture, followed by Ports-and-Adapters. More recently, it's been cited as the [Onion Architecture](https://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/) or [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

Instead of having business logic depend on data access or other infrastructure concerns, this dependency is inverted: infrastructure and implementation details depend on the Application Core. This functionality is achieved by defining abstractions, or interfaces, in the Application Core, which are then implemented by types defined in the Infrastructure layer. A common way of visualizing this architecture is to use a series of concentric circles, similar to an onion. Figure 5-7 shows an example of this style of architectural representation.",

When I tried something similar (convincing a customer that is), I have benefited from turning this around. There was no Point for me convincing anyone. It was more beneficial to explore why DDD might be helpful with what we suffer with (measurable). So first, I had to explore what I struggle with and if DDD might be worth it over other solutions that are faster, easier, cheaper or more accepted by my fellow engineers. Like writing an ADR and challenge the options by your Team. This was a more open aproach than trying to convince someone (which was my first Impuls als well).\n\nIt also helped me to understand the difference between strategical and tactical DDD to see why clean architecture is just ohne way  to do domain centric implemtation. The DDD-crew repo might be a good Point to picture this. See: [https://github.com/ddd-crew/ddd-starter-modelling-process](https://github.com/ddd-crew/ddd-starter-modelling-process)\n\nWhile clean architecture is good to close the architecture Code gap, it is not always beneficial. I guess you know most of this, as you have mentioned with the silver bullet. But this Point did only driven into my brain once I really started working with it. But I still prefer clean architecture whenever it is reasonable. I simply have a new measure for what is reasonable.\n\nI recoment \"learing Domain driven Design\" from vlad khononov to learn DDD itself. Or rather, to visit a good course to discuss this with others who try to lear this and a teacher who is stuck with you.",

Users search by city, dates, and room configuration, and I return a list of hotels with prices, similar to Google Hotels or Booking.\n\nI currently have around 3 million hotels stored in PostgreSQL with full static metadata (name, city, star rating, facilities, coordinates, and so on). Pricing, however, is fully dynamic and only comes from external supplier APIs. I can’t know the price until I call the supplier with specific dates and occupancy.\n\n**Goal**\n\n* Expose a fast, stateless, paginated `/search` endpoint.\n* Support sorting (price, rating) and filtering (stars, facilities).\n* Minimize real-time supplier calls, since they are slow, rate-limited, and expensive.\n\n**Core problem**  \nIf I only fetch real-time prices for, say, 20 hotels per page, how do I accurately sort or filter the full result set? For example, “show the cheapest hotel among 10,000 hotels in Dubai.”  \nCalling suppliers for all hotels on every search is not feasible due to cost, latency, and reliability.\n\n**Current ideas**\n\n1. Cache prices per hotel, date, and occupancy in Redis with a TTL of around 30–60 minutes. Use cached or estimated prices in search results, and only call suppliers in real time on the hotel detail page.\n2. Pre-warm caches for popular routes and date ranges (for example, Dubai or Paris for the next month) using background jobs.\n3. Restrict search-time sorting and filtering to what’s possible with cached or static data:\n   * Sort by cached price.\n   * Filter by stars and facilities.\n   * Avoid filters that require real-time data, such as free cancellation.\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. How do large platforms like Booking or Expedia actually approach this? Do they rely on cached or estimated prices in search results and only fetch real rates on the detail page?\n2. What’s a reasonable caching strategy for highly dynamic pricing?\n   * Typical TTLs?\n   * How do you handle volatility or last-minute price changes?\n   * Is ML-based price prediction commonly used when the cache is stale?\n3. How is sorting implemented without pricing every hotel? Is it common to price a larger subset (for example, the top 500–1,000 hotels) and sort only within that set?\n4. Any advice on data modeling? Should cached prices live in Redis only, PostgreSQL, or a dedicated pricing service?\n5. What common pitfalls should I watch out for, especially around stale prices and user trust?\n\n**Stack**\n\n* NestJS with TypeScript\n* PostgreSQL (PostGIS for location queries)\n* Redis for caching\n* Multiple external supplier APIs, called asynchronously\n\nI’ve read a lot about metasearch architectures at a high level, but I haven’t found concrete details on how large systems handle pricing and sorting together at scale. Insights from anyone who has worked on travel or large-scale e-commerce search would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks.",

Metasearch refers to services like Google Hotels and Kayak where they aggregate OTA results.\n\n2. Typically what happens is between search and reservation, there's an extra step that does live search. Some call  it availability check, it has all sorts of names - there's no standard here. This allows you to have slightly more control over the TTL while balancing between supplier rate limits and info accuracy.\n\n3. Back to caching search results: you pretty much figured it out already but unfortunately I don't believe there's a perfect solution. You'll have to find a sweet spot that works for you in terms of supplier rate limits, cost, and accuracy. \n\n4. My suggestion is specialize in a niche and limit the number of hotels. For TTL, I think we used to set it to a constant number like x minutes. In general, prices for stays far in the future tend to fluctuate less. But it's not a law! They also get less searches. So if you set a higher TTL for these searches, you might get higher hit but sacrifice cache utilization - which is important if you want to optimize for cost - you don't want Redis to store data no one will access!\n\n5. Pre-warming cache - only works if your feed is small and your search traffic has low entropy (all of them search for the same hotel/location). Otherwise you'll be wasting supplier API rate limits on artificial queries.\n\nI no longer work in this space but I'm still following travel tech from time to time.

In a city like Dubai, that still leaves 6–7k less popular hotels. I can’t realistically dump or keep prices updated for all of them, but I still need some price signal for search and sorting. That’s the part I’m trying to figure out: how to represent pricing for those long-tail properties without polling every hotel or overloading suppliers.",

That’s why I’m looking to design a pricing cache/pool that is refreshed periodically.\n\nThe difficulty is that a single hotel doesn’t have one price. Pricing depends on multiple variables like check-in date, length of stay, rooms, and occupancy. So the question isn’t “how to query 3M hotels,” but “how to model and cache pricing signals” in a way that:\n\n* Avoids calling suppliers for every search\n* Handles many pricing permutations reasonably\n* Allows approximate pricing for low-visibility hotels (without supplier calls) so sorting still works\n* Uses real supplier calls only for popular properties or when the user moves toward booking\n\nThat’s the core problem I’m trying to solve.",

I would investigate how the other providers get their data.\n\n\nI'm not sure if it's possible but perhaps you need to limit the scope to a start. So you users can only get prices for x variables u support? Perhaps you can combine the cache with some scraping of the individual sites, but again it depends on how non static the pricing data is. \n\n\nI totally get you think this is hard but perhaps a possibility is your application don't make sense when you don't own the pricing data?",

They come from how different teams interpret and own the system.\n\nProduct defines a rule one way.\nEngineering implements a reasonable version of it.\nBilling assumes something slightly different.\nSupport adds exceptions to keep customers happy.\nFinance looks at outcomes months later.\nEach piece is “correct” in isolation.\n\nBut when those interpretations stack over time, you end up with workflows that technically work, yet produce unintended long-lived states financial drift, entitlement confusion, or accounts that don’t match policy anymore.\nNo single line of code is wrong.\nNo single team “broke” anything.\nAnd because nothing crashes or alerts, the issue survives quietly.\n\nThat’s why these edge cases are so hard to fix:\n\nNo clear owner across the full lifecycle\nFixing it might hurt legitimate users\nSupport already has a manual workaround\nThe cost shows up slowly, not catastrophically\nFrom the outside it looks like a weird edge case.\nFrom inside the org, it’s often just organizational gravity.\nThis is also why many of these issues are discoverable purely through the frontend. The UI reflects what the company allows culturally and operationally, not just what the backend enforces.\n\nHave you run into edge cases that weren’t “bugs” but also weren’t really intentional?\nHow do your teams decide when something is acceptable behavior vs something to close?",

          "text": "For me it's always a matter of how big of a problem it is. There's always going to be something but the guiding principle is always based on what the outcome is. If it's a five alarm fire where it will block users from logging in, great, I'm fixing it now, consequences be damned for any other team. If it causes some field to show up wrong in the support portal that they can live with, probably won't be fixed any time soon. So essentially my acceptability aligns directly with severity. Maybe once upon a time I cared but at some point things scale and you kind of just have to accept no harm no foul.\n\nAlso one way I try to counteract this is have engineers write documentation that is full-featured. I want to see what the admin portal looks like with the data, I want to know how the data flows between different parts or what the database is supposed to look like. I basically tackle every problem of documentation as anyone in the org should be capable of reading it to some degree. Obviously not everyone is going to understand everything, but I want something for everyone in there, organized well enough they can quickly skim to the relevant parts. I quite routinely tell people to pretend someone else is reading it and to see if they can make sense of it. For example, I'll tell them to pretend the CTO is reading it. Is the documentation lacking a high level technical summary? What if it's the CFO instead? One of them I can be much more technical with but neither of them want to understand the schemas.\n\nAnother way we counteract this is by cross team reviews. If you are working on something that touches code another team owns you need to reach out to that team (typically their engineering lead) and get them to review. I've caught a lot of issues like this by reviewing code for other teams. Better to spend 15 minutes now preventing an issue than 15 hours fixing it later.",

The development teams would build a product with loose restrictions and the users would find ways to make it work for their specific use case. One in particular was a field called “status” that was just an open field with two characters. The uses for that field were so wild that I can’t even name 10% of them. But each team had its own use for that field and I’m fairly certain every combination of two characters was used. The business wanted to modernize eventually and the cobol programs were converted to jsp pages with spring backend. And of course, a two character “status” field. One day a director asked the development team to have a certain two character combination (a period and question mark) trigger a workflow in the backend when a user saved that status. Once other directors found out that was a thing you could do, they requested their own triggers for combinations and of course that switch statement grew like wildfire. Of course, any smart individual would see where this is headed. Some teams were having processes kick off because they typed a combination that meant one thing to them but something else for a different team. Was this a bug? No. But it highlights your point precisely. As the number of stakeholders grows and the number of development teams grows, this is just how things go in large corporations. Funny enough, the next modernization effort was led by an IT VP who was a very close minded individual that insisted the “status” field would not live to see another day. It was (unsurprisingly) one of the top listed reasons why users refused to use the new web interface and several went back to using the mainframe.",

Protobuf or whatever other serialization library has methods for this but all the examples I've seen already know the end result datatype. What happens when I just receive generic messages but don't know end datatype? \n\n  \nOnline search shows possible addition of some header data that could be used to map to a datatype. Idk.

              "text": "Protocol Buffers (protobuf) are designed for **maximum efficiency**, which means they strip away almost all metadata that humans find helpful—like field names and data types—to save space.\n\nWhen you receive a raw protobuf byte stream, it is effectively a \"nameless\" string of numbers. Here is exactly why you can't decode it without a schema or a header.\n\n1. It Uses \"Tags\" instead of Names\n\nIn JSON, you see `\"user_id\": 123`. In protobuf, the name \"user\\_id\" is never sent. Instead, it only sends a **field number** (the \"tag\") that was defined in your `.proto` file.\n\n* **The Problem:** If you receive a message starting with `Field #5`, you have no idea if #5 stands for `price`, `age`, or `zip_code` unless you have the original schema to look it up.\n\n2. The \"Wire Type\" is Ambiguous\n\nProtobuf groups all data types into just a few \"wire types\" (categories of encoding). For example, `int32`, `int64`, `uint32`, `bool`, and `enum` are all encoded using the **Varint** wire type.\n\n* **The Problem:** If the decoder sees a Varint with the value `1`, it doesn't know if that means `true` (bool), the number `1` (int), or the first entry in a list (enum). It needs the schema to know how to \"cast\" that number into the correct programmatic type.\n\n3. There Is No \"Outer\" Message Type\n\nIf you send a `LoginRequest` and a `LogoutRequest`, the binary payloads might look very similar. Unlike a self-describing format (like a JSON object that might have a `\"type\": \"Login\"` field), a raw protobuf message **does not identify itself**.\n\n* **The Problem:** The receiver just gets bytes. Without a **header** (like an ID in the TCP packet or a gRPC metadata field) or a pre-defined sequence, the receiver won't even know which message class to use for decoding.\n\n4. It Is Not \"Self-Delimiting\"\n\nProtobuf does not have \"start\" or \"end\" markers (like `{ }` in JSON). It is just a stream of fields.\n\n* **The Problem:** If you are reading from a stream (like a network socket), you don't know where one message ends and the next begins. This is why most implementations use a \"Length-Prefixed\" header—essentially a small number at the very beginning that tells you \"the next 150 bytes are one message.\"\n\n#",

Procedure, in this case, implies a *single method*. Yes, this is essentially evoking a method call in an entirely separate runtime over the network.\n\nWith that mindset, a different data type would simply be an overloaded signature and ergo a different method or RPC call. It's not 'restrictive' in the same sense that OOP isn't 'rescrictive' of how objects can be used. It's that way because that's OOP. \n\nYou **could** pass them all with some blank and others populated, then have the receiving method decipher what the hell it just got... But at that point you've lost the plot. It's why infinitely dynamic signatures don't really exist (we're ignoring loosely typed languages here).\n\nRPC is glorious because it bypasses all of the interpretation layers of compute just trying to figure out what to do with what data was given to it. All you get is exactly what you expect then you immediately get to using it. Clean, to the point, and extremely performant. Obviously not meant for general-purpose stuff as this tightly couples both services together so proceed with care.",

But looking at modern breaches, it’s hard not to see his point.\nMost failures don’t start with zero-days or broken crypto.\n\nThey start with:\nsomeone trusting context instead of verifying\nsomeone acting under urgency or authority\nsomeone following a workflow that technically allows a bad outcome\nMitnick believed hacking was less about breaking systems and more about understanding how humans behave inside them. \n\nSocial engineering worked not because systems were weak, but because people had to make decisions with incomplete information.\nWhat’s interesting is that even today, many incidents labeled as “technical” are really human edge cases: valid actions, taken in the wrong sequence, under the wrong assumptions.\n\nSo I want to know how people here see it now:\nWas Mitnick right, and we still haven’t fully designed for human failure?\nOr have modern systems (MFA, zero trust, guardrails) finally reduced the human factor enough?\n\nIf people are the weakest link, is that a security failure or just reality we need to accept and design around?\n\nGenuinely interested in how practitioners think about this today",

Governance easily overreaches here.  \nWe had to learn to “pick our battles” and leave teams freedom internally to keep speed and ownership high.\n\nIf I were to start again, I would probably look into Architecture as Code earlier. I personally don’t have strong tool recommendations yet, so for us it always came down to a cost/benefit trade-off: documentation in Confluence vs. technical enforcement via tooling.\n\nWhat helped us a lot in the beginning were guild / community structures. They gave us a natural place to grow standards and patterns together with the people actually doing the work. Our experience was that governance has to be built with the teams, otherwise commitment stays shallow.\n\nOne more thing we learned:  \nSomeone needs to clearly own moderation and final decisions. Without a visible decision owner, we never really converged on a shared strategy.",

I would start with a small, accepted core of architects in the middle, give them a clear mandate to moderate and decide, and grow from there.\n\nEven a lightweight governance setup already helps:\n\n\\- to avoid building new technical debt\n\n\\- to even make technical debt visible and understandable in the first place\n\n\\- to create clarity in decisions\n\n\\- in the long run to make everyone who touches architecture stronger\n\n  \nGood luck!",

          "text": "My 2c on this:\n\n1. I think the mental model of a system is what [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf) describes as the \"system architecture\": the significant components, their interfaces with other components and systems. The tricky part is to identify the \"significant\" components, it's something only the developers in the project can tell. It's fuzzy, but some indicators are: parts of system that receive constant updates, the *critical* part of the system (i.e. if this component breaks we no longer have a *working* system).\n2. Linus Torvalds has a cool [quote](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/163185/torvalds-quote-about-good-programmer) that can give some insight: *\"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.\"*\n\nI try to keep a good understanding of:\n\n* The components in the system e.g. web apps, internal and external APIs, data sources, orchestrators, etc. More so at a high-level: \"this is a web app that is used by X persona for Y thing\" or \"we use service X to process payments\".\n* How these components interact with each other and when, e.g. \"we have a payment processor that consumes some 3rd party providers, and the logic varies depending on the country or running promotional campaigns.\n* The high level data structures e.g. a Product, an Order, a Payment or Shipment. I think it makes it easier to reason as \"an Order can have several Products, and once the Payment succeeds we create a Shipment for the Order. It's very abstract and high level, and each part will map to a different part of the system.\n\nNow, all of that usually lives in the minds of the developers, the hard part is to communicate this understanding to others. There's really no silver bullet for that, and I see good recommendations in the other comments. I think the foundation for most documentation is to actually learn *how to write*. I mean, anyone can write a bunch of words and text that makes sense to them, and you can generate a lot of text with modern LLMs, the difficult part is to write something that is *useful* to people so they actually want to read it. Not too high-level, not too low-level, targeting the correct audience, writing succinctly while providing explanations or references when necessary. It's really an art.",

Just this alone creates a conveyer belt level description of how value flows through the business. Then, show the inputs and the outputs of the capabilities within the subdomain. Altogether this creates a  distilled model that maps technology to the business. It allows stakeholder to ask questions such as “which subdomains are core, supporting and generic to the business?” “What capabilities do we have in X subdomain?”. In my practical experience as an architect for large enterprises this works far better than C4 because it is low effort to maintain and reason about and more stakeholders can understand it.

What breaks first tends to be in two different major areas: specific-technology (e.g. exact capabilities, necessary integrations) and general-administrative (e.g. year-long procurement processes, regulated-industry compliance).   \n  \nHonest feedback: your website hits many of the problems that I encounter often, such as claiming \"single source of truth\", and doing a 14-day evaluation period which is far too short to be pragmatic-- I much prefer federated approaches and 1-year evaluation period for non-production work. See the book Data Mesh for an excellent approach to the enterprise federation aspects-- I would love to buy a comparable book for Event Mesh.",

For example, we might decide that we're building a monolithic golang app with a postgres database, or we might decide that we're building a set of typescript microservices that will run as cloudflare workers. Those decisions will lead to very different constraints in future.\n\nSoftware architecture as a _process_ is the practices we employ to make those hard-to-change decisions. We ideally make those decisions by gathering the functional and non-functional requirements, understanding the constraints, and then making choices that satisfy all our constraints while providing maximum optionality for the future, ie, the ability to change our minds when we realise we got it wrong.\n\nSystem design is ... designing a system... I guess it's possible to design a system without considering the constraints or the ability to change our minds, but I would still call that \"doing architecture\", just doing it badly.\n\nA software architect is someone who leads that process of making decisions and builds consensus and understanding with teams so that everyone is on the same page about the decisions they're making, and the reasons for choosing those decisions.\n\nI think you're looking for clear definitions for things, but that's not how human endeavours work. We're describing processes by which people create a thing together, and that's necessarily messy and without hard edges.",

Is it only because this data is not needed long term and any failure to insert to db is not an issue? And also more importantly writing to db first and returning response is slower than writing to redis for this API use case?\n\nThe usual pattern I have seen, people write to db and then on a fetch, add a copy to redis cache and on any subsequent query for the same key return the cached copy instead of fetching from db.",

Done.\n\n\nRedis not meeting your SLA (e.g. several seconds of data loss not acceptable)? Get a fast but durable DB like ScyllaDB or Cassandra, or use a managed one like DynamoDB. Or maybe consider Volt Active Data. There's a lot of interesting infra to choose from.\n\n\nIf your entities are fairly few but mutating fast, consider an in-memory architecture where there's no read-modify-write loop, only appends. Event Sourcing dovetails with this, but is far from the only choice. In any case, invest early in concurrency control (mutual exclusion) so that a split brain can't ruin your consistency.\n\n\nIn some very rare write-only scenarios, it makes sense to persist to a stream only, like Kafka, NATS JetStream, or Apache Pulsar. This can be great for maintaining a stable latency, but has one major downside: there is no way to know if the operation eventually succeeds or fails. Therefore, it is only useful in fire-and-forget requests, like Web telemetry where the client doesn't really care about getting data back.",

Think: the difference between a well architected autopilot in a plane vs one-and-done games on the App Store. \n\nSo depending on many factors, a well designed system can be vital - or not. It’s one set of tools in the wider toolbox of technology building. \n\nA badly designed system, goes the other way. \n\nThink of it like building a boat. Someone people may just need a raft to cross the river once, so if you’re in the raft building business you don’t need heavy design. Other people need nuclear submarines, which do need heavy design. If I am building rafts, then actually having lots of system design could make it more expensive and less profitable. Or, it could help me build a factory which automates building rafts. \n\nWithout knowing more about your industry and business it’s hard to say, but this could be an opportunity for optimisation or a wasted effort in your specific firm. As a whole economy, many firms require systems thinking.",

First, they make escalation entry structured. If required inputs aren’t there, the escalation literally can’t be raised. That removes back and forth and Slack chasing. Second, ownership is role based, not person based. A queue or rotation beats “ask whoever is around.” Third, escalations are visible by default. A shared board or system that shows status, age, and next action creates pressure without anyone nagging.\n\nIf escalation depends on calls or DMs, it’s already broken. People will always route around friction. The goal is to make the right path the easiest path, and the wrong one annoying enough that it fades out naturally.\n\nMost real improvements come from tightening intake and visibility, not adding more rules.",

You need actual standardized forms/templates and enforce they are filled out between handoffs as evidence. But if someone at the top isn’t enforcing people follow it, no one will. Or some will, but it doesn’t work if some don’t follow it. I find this to be an issue at larger companies where the only common upper management across teams might be VP level and they aren’t getting involved in these things. So then the solution is some levels of management down the chain need to coordinate and agree and they tend to be in their own worlds at big companies, not focused on coordinating with other directors on processes. \n\nSo all that is to say, it’s real easy in theory, but my experience is it’s hard at big companies where management of all the teams involved are not necessarily tightly synced on processes and their views on enforcing/following them. At smaller companies, the VP of engineering might actually be involved in these things and enforce that the different teams involved actually follow the processes. \n\nJust my experience. I’m sure some larger companies have their shit together, but I haven’t seen it myself.",

It has been rock solid for 30yrs.\n\nI would first ask how these logs are intended to be used (what are the use cases). Is it a regulatory requirement, internal reporting etc. this will influence design rationale. \n\nI would then ask how long the activity logs need to be retained for, what volumes are you expect, what growth and how critical they are to the service you are providing. This will influence scale and service need in the design. Simple things as table truncation are easy and effective where long term retention isn't needed. For long time series storage solutions (an option in Postgres) you can even down sample data points over time.\n\nFinally, consider the ongoing operational support. Sure it's easy to spin up a DB service in most cloud environments, but you still need internal support knowledge and experience for the life of the solution. This needs to be factored in.\n\nWith that I would then do some rough options analysis. Why a NoSQL like MongoDB and not Postgres, or logstash, or even using Grafana and graphite.  Understand and discuss the trade offs and then make the decision. Otherwise it's personal opinion that increases code complexity.",

Here are the issues I'm encountering.\n\nRight now I have three layers. The controllers, services, and repositories.\n\nThere might be errors in the repository layer that need to be handled in the service layer, or handled in the controller layer. These errors may be silenced in that place, or propagated up all the way to the frontend. So we need to be concerned with:\n\n1. Catching errors at the right boundary\n2. Propagating them further if necessary\n\nThen there's the issue of creating errors consistently. There will be many errors that are of the same kind. I may end up creating a message for one kind of error in one way, then a completely different error message for the same kind of error in the same file (or service).\n\nSo I would say error management applies to the following targets: creating errors, handling errors at their boundaries, and propagating them further.\n\nFor each target, we need to be concerned with consistency and completeness. Thus we have the following concerns: \n\n1. Error creation\n   1. Have we consistently created errors? \n   2. Have we created the errors necessary? \n2. Error handling\n   1. Have we consistently handled the same kind of errors at their boundaries? \n   2. Have we covered all the errors' boundaries?\n3. Error propagation\n   1. Have we consistently propagated the same kind of errors?\n   2. Have we propagated all the errors necessary?\n\nHow do we best answer these concerns?",

Spreading error handling code around your app, as a pattern rather than through necessity, can get very messy.\n\nSay you’re trying to read a user from the DB and it fails.\n\nYou’d probably have something in your infrastructure layer to catch that error, log it and retry, if it’s still failing after retrying it gets thrown to bubble up the call stack.\n\nYour service layer may be able to continue despite the failing query, in which case it can. If it can’t, it also allows the error to bubble up.\n\nThat eventually reaches your middleware and you have something that automatically writes out a 500 with a problem details RFC response and logs the error.\n\nErrors relating to user input should be raised as high up the call stack as possible, close to the source. You don’t want an invalid request being partially processed. As soon as a request comes in, validate it, and return a 400 if it’s invalid - your framework can usually do this for you.\n\nIf a request is valid, then it should only fail due to things like a network error, a dependency being unavailable, etc, which the middleware approach works fine for.\n\nWhy do you find yourself creating many exception classes / messages yourself? It’s not that this is bad per se, but you don’t need to be catching a DB error and throwing your own custom exception for the same thing, just allow the original exception to bubble up.",

It’s better to just build a bespoke system hyper-tailored to your requirements that can grow WITH the business over time.\n\nIt’s like buying a suit. If that Walmart suit fits perfectly, then hooray.

When the data model is stable and the rules are mostly straightforward, devs get real time back and the business can move faster without constant handoffs.\n\nWhere it starts to break is when these tools slowly drift into core product territory.

That is where an orchestration layer helps, and why we at Luther chose to keep the process logic as code (what we call the Common Operations script). Luther is built for mega-workflows with workflow templates and hundreds of connectors, to deliver faster.

      "text": "I am building a microservices-based application that consists of multiple services (service-1, service-2, service-3, etc.), an API Gateway, and a Service Registry. For security, I am using **Keycloak**.\n\nHowever, I am currently a bit confused about the overall security architecture. I have listed my questions below, and I would really appreciate it if you could share your expertise.\n\n1. From my understanding of the Keycloak architecture: when a client hits our signup or login endpoint, the request should be redirected to Keycloak. After that, everything is handled by Keycloak, which then returns a JWT token that is used to access all protected endpoints. Does this mean that we do **not** need to implement our own signup/login endpoints in our system at all?\n2. If my understanding of Keycloak is correct, how can I manage different roles for different user types (for example, Customer and Admin)? I ll have two different endpoints for registering customers and admins, but I am unable to figure out how role assignment and role mapping should work in this case.\n3. Should I use the API Gateway as a single point where **authentication, authorization, and routing** are all handled, leaving the downstream services without any security checks? Or should the API Gateway handle authentication and authorization, while each individual service still has its own security layer to validate the JWT token? what is the standard way for this?\n4. Are there any other important aspects I should consider while designing the security architecture that I might be missing right now?\n\nThank you!",

Yep, although you will need your own frontend sign up/login pages potentially if you don't use the keycloak defaults\n2. Just add the roles in the keycloak management app (that you will have to host yourself). Or you can add them via API calls from your own services\n3. Authorization should be based on the roles in the JWT inside your app and services, routing in the gateway, and authentication could happen in either\n4. See 0",

The concrete model implements those hooks using persistence concerns.\n\nIt’s not a replacement for DDD, and not a defense of Active Record either — more an attempt to formalize a pragmatic middle ground that many teams seem to arrive at organically.\n\nThe article uses a simple hotel booking example (Python / SQLAlchemy), discusses trade-offs limits of the pattern, and explains where other approaches fit better.\n\nArticle: [https://medium.com/@hamza-senhajirhazi/domain-composed-models-dcm-a-pragmatic-middle-ground-between-active-record-and-clean-ddd-e44172a58246](https://medium.com/@hamza-senhajirhazi/domain-composed-models-dcm-a-pragmatic-middle-ground-between-active-record-and-clean-ddd-e44172a58246)\n\nI’d be genuinely interested in counter-examples or critiques—especially from people who’ve applied DDD in production systems.",

But outbox has its own cost:\n- amplifies db writes - assume 10k entities inserted per second where each needs to publish an event, now you need to insert 10k additional records to db, which are going to be deleted seconds later by outbox job, so looks like db needs to do 3 times more work (CDC can help a lot though if it is available) - more CPU usage, more IOPS utilization, transactional log burden\n- outbox introduces some additional latency as it typically runs every X seconds\n- implementation with noSQL variants not supporting cross table/collection transactions is more complex than with SQL\n\nFor some cases, outbox or CDC is required - for example where consumer is some other service which does not confirms back.\n\nHowever, in case of communication between internal modules, where you publish event from let's say API layer, then some background process does its own processing and later on publishes success/failure event so API updates its db state and is aware whether process finished or not, what about alternative approach to just have re-publish background job. It queries db and finds unfinished processes with with sone threshold like 5 minute and simply republishes events.\n\nPros:\n- in high throughput systems, much less DB burden (query per X seconds instead of YYYY inserts per second)\n- event publication without delay incurred by outbox/CDC scan leads to better E2E times\n\nCons:\n- not immediately clear whether process is 'hanged' due to failed publication or downstream service failure, if it's downstream failure relublishing will only put more load on downstream service and duplicate events (anyway, idempotent processing should be implemented)\n- usable only when downstream publishes feedback messages at the end of its processing, otherwise no way to know whether 3rd party received event or not\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nFor me:\n- baseline - standard outbox with outbox processor/CDC\n- if you have very good reasons - maybe republishing job could work under specific circumstances \n",

When a person deviates, the blast radius is usually local.\nAgents don’t have that safety net. Once you have multiple agents acting asynchronously across time, tools, and domains, relying on “they’ll write a plan and follow it” stops working. Not because they can’t — but because no one else can inspect, replay, or reason about why something happened later.\nThat’s where governance matters: not as discipline, but as infrastructure. Making intent, assumptions, and success criteria first-class artifacts so decisions remain legible after the fact.\nIn other words, agency without governance isn’t worse than people — it’s worse than people at scale.",

No more overloads with 7–8 parameters, half of which are null half the time.\n\n**Why it helped me:**\n\n* Step-by-step object setup feels more natural.\n* Tests are clearer because it’s obvious what fields you’re setting.\n* Reduces subtle bugs from bad constructor calls.\n\nHas anyone else found design patterns like this helpful in real apps? And do you tend to apply them consciously or just recognize them after they appear in your code?\n\nThoughts? 👇\n\n*Edit:* I’m using TS/Node, but I know this pattern is classic OOP.

      "text": "Hi everyone. I’m a junior  developer, currently working alone on a fairly large project. I want to keep the codebase clean, consistent, and built with a solid architecture.\n\nI have a few architectural questions and would really appreciate feedback from more experienced developers.\n\n# 1) Entity / DTO / Response and services\n\nAt the moment, I have many endpoints, and as a result my service layer contains a large number of different DTOs and response classes. This makes the code harder to read and maintain.\n\nI’ve considered several approaches:\n\n* Making services return **one common DTO**, and mapping it to specific response objects in the controller\n* Or returning **entities directly from services**, and doing the mapping to response objects in controllers (with response classes located near controllers)\n\nThe problem is that when working with entities, unnecessary relations are often fetched, which increases database load—especially if I always return a single “large” DTO.  \nAt the same time, according to best practices, services are usually not supposed to return entities directly.\n\nBut what if services always return entities, and mapping is done only in controllers?  \nHow bad (or acceptable) is this approach in real-world projects?\n\nWhich approach is generally considered more correct in production systems?\n\n# 2) Complex business logic and use cases\n\nI’ve been reading books about DDD and Clean Code and tried to reduce the size of my services:\n\n* Part of the business logic was moved into entities\n* Services now look more like use-case scenarios\n\nHowever, some use cases are still quite complex.\n\nFor example:\n\n* There is `UserService.create()` which saves a user\n* After that, an email might be sent, related entities might be created, or other services might be called\n\nCurrently, this is implemented using domain events:\n\n    publisher.publish(new UserCreatedEvent(user));\n    \n\nThe downside is that when you open the service code, it’s not always clear **what actually happens**, unless you inspect all the event listeners.\n\nSo I’m considering another approach:\n\n* `UserService` — only CRUD operations and repository access\n* `UserUseCaseService` — orchestration of complex business scenarios\n\nExample:\n\n    userService.create(user);\n    \n    mailService.sendEmail(user.getEmail());\n    userApplicationService.create(user);\n    \n\nThe questions are:\n\n* Is this approach over-engineered?\n* Is it acceptable in production to introduce a separate “use-case” layer for complex operations?\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice and real-world examples from your experience 🙌",

Challenge here is we need to build infrastructure around the cleanup job in case it gets killed midway.\n\nWe’re especially worried about:\n\n* Long-running deletes (10–60 minutes)\n* Vacuum / bloat\n* Locks\n* Restartability if something crashes\n* Being able to see progress per table\n\nIf you’ve built this at scale:\n\n* Where did you run the deletion loops?\n* Did you use stored procedures, background workers, or something else?\n* Any Postgres-specific gotchas (vacuum, indexes, partitioning, etc)?\n\nLooking for real-world patterns, not theory.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "NOTE: This is still a work-in-progress and partially a close-source project. To view the open source version see [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/chat). It has NOT been audited or reviewed. For testing purposes only, not a replacement for your current messaging app. I have open source examples of various part of the app and im sure more investigation needs to be done for all details of this project. USE RESPONSIBLY!\n\nIm aiming to create the \"theoretically\" most secure messaging app. This has to be entirely theoretical because its impossible to create the \"worlds most secure messaging app\". Cyber-security is a constantly evolving field and no system can be completely secure.\n\nIf you'd humor me, i tried to create an exhaustive list of features and practices that could help make my messaging app as secure as possible. Id like to open it up to scrutiny.\n\n[Demo](https://p2p.positive-intentions.com/iframe.html?globals=&id=demo-p2p-messaging--p-2-p-messaging&viewMode=story)\n\n(Im grouping into green, orange and red because i coudnt think of a more appropriate title for the grouping.)\n\nGreen\n\n* P2P - so that it can be decentralized and not rely on a central server for exchanging messages. The project is using WebRTC to establish a p2p connection between browsers.\n* End to end encryption - so that even if the messages are intercepted, they cannot be read. The project is using an application-level [cascading cipher](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1oi4xqt/multiprotocol_cascading_roundrobin_cipher/) on top of the encryption provided by WebRTC. the key sub-protocols involves in the approach are [Signal](https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/1orsjw2/signal_protocol_in_javascript/), MLS and AES. while there has been pushback on the cascading cipher, rest-assured that this is functioning on and application-level and the purpose of the cipher is that it guarantees that the \"stronger\" algoritm comes up on top. any failure will result in a cascading failure... ultimately redundent on top of the mandated WebRTC encryption. i would plan to add more protocols into this cascade to investigate post-quantum solutions.\n* Perfect forward secrecy - so that if a key is compromised, past messages cannot be decrypted. WebRTC already provides a reasonable support for this in firefox. but the signal and mls protocol in the cascading cipher also contribute resiliance in this regard.\n* Key management - so that users can manage their own keys and not rely on a central authority. there is key focus on having local-only encryption keys. sets of keys are generated for each new connection and resued in future sessions.\n* Secure signaling - so that the initial connection between peers is established securely. there are many approaches to secure signaling and while a good approach could be exchanging connection data offline, i would also be further improving this by providing more options. its possible to establish a webrtc connection without a connection-broker [like this](https://github.com/positive-intentions/chat/issues/6).\n* Minimal infrastructure - so that there are fewer points of failure and attack. in the Webrtc approach, messages can be sent without the need of a central server and would also work in an offline hotspot network.\n* Support multimedia - so that users can share animations and videos. this is important to provide an experience to users that makes the project appraling. there is progress made on the [ui component library](https://ui.positive-intentions.com/) to provide various features and functionality users expect in a messaging app.\n* Minimize metadata - so no one knows who’s messaging who or when. i think the metadata is faily minimal, but ultimately is reletive to how feature-rich i want the application. things like notification that a \"user is typing\" can be disabled, but its a common offering in normal messaging apps. similarly i things read-reciepts can be a useful feature but comes with metadata overhead. i hope to discuss these feature more in the future and ultimately provide the ability to disable this.\n\nOrange\n\n* Open source - moving towards a hybrid approach where relevent repositories are open source.\n* Remove registration - creating a messaging app that eliminates the need for users to register is a feature that i think is desired in the cybersec space. the webapp approach seems to offer the capabilities and is working. as i move towards trying to figure out monetization, im unable to see how registration can be avoided.\n* Encrypted storage - browser based cryptography is fairly capable and its possible to have important data like encryption keys encrypted at rest. this is working well when using passkeys to derive a password. this approach is still not complete because there will be improvements to take advantage of the filesystem API in order to have better persistence. passkeys wont be able to address this easily because they get cleared when you clear the site-data (and you lose the password for decrypting the data).\n* User education - the app is faily technical and i could use a lot more time to provide better information to users. the current website has a lot of technical details... but i think its a mess if you want to find information. this needs to be improved.\n* Offline messaging - p2p messaging has its limitations, but i have an idea in mind for addressing this, by being able to spin up a selfhosted version that will remain online and proxy messages to users when they come online. this is still in the early stages of development and is yet to be demonstrated.\n* Self-destructing messages - this is a common offering from secure messaging apps. it should be relatively simple to provide and will be added as a feature \"soon\".\n* Javascript - there is a lot of rhetiric against using javascript for a project like this because of conerns about it being served over the internet. this is undestandable, but i think [concerns can be mitigated](https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberSecurityAdvice/comments/1ev5kqn/is_this_a_secure_messaging_app/). i can provide a selfhostable static-bundle to avoid fetching statics from the intetnet. there is additional investigation towards using service workers to cache the nessesary files for offline. i would like to make an explicit button to \"fetch latests statics\". the functionality is working, but more nees to be done before rolling out this functionality.\n* Decentralized profile: users will want to be able to continue conversations across devices. It's possible to implement a p2p solution for this. This is an ongoing investigation.\n\nRed\n\n* Regular security audits - this could be important so that vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed promptly. security audits are very expensive and until there is any funding, this wont be possible. a spicier alternative here is an in-house security audit. i have made attempts to create such audits for the signal protocols and MLS. im sure i can dive into more details, but ultimately an in-house audit in invalidated by any bias i might impart.\n* Anonymity - so that users can communicate without revealing their identity is a feature many privacy-advocates want. p2p messages has nuanced trandoffs. id like to further investigate onion style routing, so that the origins can be hidden, but i also notice that webrtc is generally discourage when using the TOR network. it could help if users user a VPN, but that strays further from what i can offer as part of my app. this is an ongoing investigation.\n\nAiming to provide industry grade security encapsulated into a standalone webapp. Feel free to reach out for clarity on any details.\n\n [Demo](https://p2p.positive-intentions.com/iframe.html?globals=&id=demo-p2p-messaging--p-2-p-messaging&viewMode=story)\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: It's worth repeating, this is still a work in progress and not ready to replace any existing solution.
