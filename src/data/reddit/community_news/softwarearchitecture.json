      "text": "Hi All,  \n  \nI've been a software architect for last 12 years, 24 years yoe overall. I have worked on large enterprises as well as early stage startups.\n\nHere are patterns I keep seeing repeatedly where projects are messed particularly in startups, which I wanted to share:\n\n**Premature microservices**. Your team is 4 engineers and you have 8 services and thinking to build 4 more. You don’t have a scaling problem. You have a coordination problem. A well-structured monolith would let you move 3x faster right now. I would suggest go for modular monolith always.\n\n**No clear data ownership**. Three services write to the same database table. Nobody knows which one is the source of truth. This becomes a nightmare at scale and during incidents. Again go for modular monolith, and if you want strictly then CQRS is way to go (but still overkill if you don't have that much scale)\n\n**Ignoring operational complexity.** The architecture diagram looks awesome . But nobody thought about deployment, observability, or what happens at 3 AM when the message queue backs up.\n\n**Over-engineering for hypothetical scale**. You have 5000 users, but only 500 MAUs. You don’t need Kubernetes, a service mesh, and event sourcing. Build for the next 10x, not the next 1000x.\n\nMost of these are fixable without a rewrite. Usually it’s a few targeted changes that unlock the next stage of growth.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone is dealing with similar challenges.",

But at the same time avoid insert hotspots by inserting everything at the same page. There is very well written documentation on this from the SQL Server teams.\n* Make sure no page locks are taking place on the pages you are inserting to. So use correct isolation levels in queries.\n* Keep the amount of indexes on tables small as possible.

CQRS and eventual consistency are 2 different subjects. Can a CQRS system utilize eventual consistency? Sure. Is eventual consistency a part of CQRS? No.\n\n>  additional infrastructure headache: separate read databases, event buses/message queues, projections, more things to deploy, monitor and debug.\n\nThis is just patently wrong. \n\nEverything you've said about CQRS is wrong except for two different read and write paths. Literally all that is required for CQRS is instead of having an OrderService that both queries and saves information, you split it into an OrderReadService and OrderWriteService.\n\nCQRS says absolutely nothing about data storage. It doesn't mean you're using eventual consistency. It doesn't require 2 databases or read replica.",

Even when it comes to writing code, AI agent are far from having \"solved\" it.\n\n_A Philosophy of Software Design_ by John Ousterhout makes the distinction between tactical coding and strategic coding. AI agents are tactical tornados; they will get the job done, but they don't care about technical debt or the maintainability of their answers. They write, write, write, until they are confronted by their own mess, and then fail to write any more coherent code.\n\nUnless your codebase has solid foundations and you spend a lot of time improving these foundations, using strategic code, your codebase will become a mess.\n\nHow much time should you spend on human-made strategic code vs. agent-made tactical code? I don't know. John Ousterhout proposed 20% strategic / 80% tactical, but he wrote his book before AI agents were a thing.\n\nThis barely scratches the surface. As a developer, coding is just one part of my job. I spend the majority of my time communicating with stakeholders, designing solutions, managing projects, etc. AI agents can help me brainstorm and put my thoughts into words, but I doubt an AI agent would be able to replace me.",

You can always extract services later when you actually know where the boundaries are.\n\nThe one thing I would add: when that extraction eventually happens, the number one source of pain is API contracts between the new services. Inside a monolith you have compile time safety. The moment you split something into a separate service communicating over HTTP, a field rename or a type change becomes invisible until something breaks at runtime.\n\nSo if you start with a monolith, structure it with clear module boundaries and explicit interfaces between domains. That way when the time comes to extract a service, you already know what the contract looks like. Teams that skip this step end up with a distributed monolith that has all the downsides of microservices and none of the benefits.\n\nTo answer your question: yes, monolith first every time. But treat your internal module boundaries as if they were API contracts from day one. Future you will be grateful.",

              "text": "I love the spirit and wit of this comment, but having been knee-deep in DCB in the recent months, here are some additional perspectives on the topic from my recent experience, that hopefully may enlighten the reader on what \"unlearning\" and \"learning it again\" may mean.\n\nThe best definition of an aggregate that I came across is that of a \"consistency and concurrency boundary\".  The aggregate is responsible for validating business invariants it encapsulates, and, as a corollary, you can't write concurrently to same aggregate. This can be painful in many natural hierarchical relationships that arise when modeling any domain, the classical DCB example being that of a \"Course\" and a \"Student\". As far as I know, without DCB, the \"correct\" way of handling cross-aggregate constraints is to leverage some form or orchestration with compensation such as a saga, but this feels extremely heavy in systems for which we don't expect significant load.\n\nDCB's idea is that, in order to make any business decision, the decision will be based on a set of relevant events, and the consistency / concurrency boundary is not fixed to a predefined entity (aggregate), but instead based on the stability of the event set used for the decision. For instance, if all you need to enroll a student abc into a course xyz is that the course exists and the student exists, then your event set for consistency purposes is \"(COURSE\\_CREATED OR COURSE\\_CANCELLED) where course\\_id = 'xyz'\" and \"STUDENT\\_CREATED where student\\_id = abc\".\n\nThe \"unlearning\" part is that, for anyone having struggled with aggregate-induced modeling problems, DCB feels magical. No more aggregate, only events. Need a new command ? Ask what events it needs for consistency, project them in the relevant shape, and you're done. Amazing ! But soon, you will have 12 commands and 15 event types, every command will be building its own projection, which is basically a small model of the domain, and everything will be hard to understand. We have traded rigidity for chaos. Whoops.\n\nSo here's the relearning that happened to me: aggregates still make sense in the context of DCB. There is a \"Course\" aggregate, and a \"Student\" aggregate, they have a well-defined projection from the event store, and they handle (almost) all invariants that are related to them. They are also natural entities to create read-models for for UI and integration purposes. DCB is here still, but rather than everything defining its own little custom projection, we define custom projections in a very restricted manner, only for cases where true \"cross-aggregates\" invariants should be enforced, and we expect that loading the full aggregates would lead to concurrency problems.\n\nWhat I've observed in practice is that our commands broadly fall into two categories:  \n\\- Commands that are interested in one single aggregate, and take rich business decisions on that aggregate based on complex state.  \n\\- Commands that are interested in multiple aggregates, but that only need to make \"simple\" decisions, and work off a small set of distinct events (typically existential events such as creation / cancellations)\n\nThe first kind should use full \"aggregates\", even when not strictly necessary. Only the second kind should use custom projections, and even for those, I found that some form of limited \"existential\" projection can be shared across multiple commands (e.g. \"Enroll student is course / remove student from course\").",

Do you have any example of something that went into the \"hard to understand\" territory?\n\nBecause how I see it, even if you have these custom projections that otherwise would be on the aggreagte, they still would only be bound to the one tag of that aggregate. Nothing really changes except the ability to use per-property precision in the folding of events into state. Get all of those custom projections together, and now you have your traditional aggregate again.\n\nThe commands that do span multiple tags still benefit over the traditional way, ofcourse.",

And remember, you will only need to fully load the aggregate root on _write_ operations which will constitute less than 10%(or even 1%). So I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Around 1MB of data is fine. Do a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation of how large your aggregate can grow.

If you try to keep everything in one aggregate, depending on the complexity of the bounded context, you're going to have something akin to a god class that is very hard to understand before you start having memory problems (because that aggregate will have to be the entry point to ALL domain behavior).\n\nThere are ways to model the \"a restaurant can’t have more than 50 branches\" rule without having the branch be an entity in the restaurant aggregate. The restaurant has to own that rule, yes, but it only needs to know how many branches it has, not their names, menus, and employees. So the restaurant only holds a list of branch IDs, and it checks their count on an addBranch method. If it needs to be transaction-safe but you don't want to deal with cross-aggregate transactions, you can use a saga or reservation pattern.\n\nBut everything is a trade-off, and you have to make the trade-off analysis yourself. Multiple aggregates might actually make things less readable and more complex if you have a lot of these cross-aggregate rules.",

You say that the tech will come before the game design, but it feels hard to understand or evaluate your choices without a proper game design.\n\nFor example one of your design goals seems to be persistence. Without knowing what you will be persisting, how often etc. it's very hard to understand the proposed architecture.\n\nAnother important question is are you building a real-time 3D game where players need to coexist in the same physics simulation (collisions, gravity etc.), or is this smaller in scope? A real time 3D game, especially one that supports combat has very different requirements (for example for latency and simulation) than a turn based 2D game.\n\n\nOh and lastly, are you using AI to write these docs? They feel very verbose and with low information density. If you want others to read and understand this it might be worth investing into learning a more concise writing style.",

      "text": "I stumbled upon two rare architectural patterns: *Sandwich* (which AFAIK was never formulated before) and *Cell* (which has different meanings in WSO2 and Amazon documentation).\n\n[*Sandwich*](https://itnext.io/sandwich-architecture-3d0de71503f6) is a metapattern - a family of patterns with identical topology (structural diagram) and similar function. It describes a system with a modular or distributed domain level sandwiched between monolithic application and data layers (hence the name). This topology is found in *Blackboard Architecture*, *Space-Based Architecture*, and *Service-Based Architecture* by Mark Richards. I suspect that many real-world *Sandwiches* go under the radar being dismissed as transitionary architectures between *Layers* and *(Micro-)Services*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nmiapc9lbvlg1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d0eee81766451b2c7ba7cde90e7f2321b2fe248\n\n[*Cell*](https://itnext.io/cell-777e87543e93) (aka *Cluster* or *Domain*) is a pattern for treating a cluster of closely cooperating services as a single system component. The *Cell*'s internals are isolated from its environment by a *Cell Gateway* (for incoming requests), *Adapters* (one for every external service used by the *Cell*) and, in some cases, *Ambassador Plugins* (that allow other services to inject their business logic into the *Cell*), which makes *Cell* to be a kind of *Hexagonal Architecture* with a distributed core.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jjk7yfobvlg1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e36f8db003e3b8e4d400594c7fab186e1fcd391\n\nAs both patterns describe coupled (sub)systems, a *Sandwich* fits well inside a *Cell*.\n\nSadly, for now both articles are on Medium, which is hard to read, and which likes to show a \"please register\" popup (which is discardable but still annoying). The patterns should appear on the Metapatterns website in a couple of weeks (that are needed to integrate them into the pattern language).",

      "text": "Hi, I'm working on an open-source app ecosystem idea and would like some early input. There's a problem in the software world: all software is broadly divided between\n\n* a) local apps that save files on your drive as files (or database records, sometimes), or\n* b) SaaS that only persists your work to a vendor's servers.\n\nSome local apps (particularly mobile ones) look like a), but are actually b) and they nag you for a subscription fee before long.\n\n  \nClearly, having a cloud-based service where you can access your data from anywhere is beneficial for most people. On the other hand, what's not beneficial is having your data held somewhere by a company that you only marginally trust, without a real possibility of leaving.\n\nA compellingly fortunate case is where an app lets you work in the browser or natively on the desktop, but save/load your results to a selection of vendors, so that you're not tied to a particular company. This decoupling of compute/storage is rare but precious - as is the case with [draw.io](http://draw.io), a popular (open-source) diagramming tool, which I'm sure many readers are no strangers to.\n\nEven then, one cannot expect the application developer to support all imaginable vendors from all over the world, so you're left with the usual suspects: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. What if you don't really like anybody on that list? You can, of course, download the file locally and manually upload/sync it to wherever, but it seems like a less convenient and more error-prone flow, overall.\n\nNow, the general concept is this: **decouple storage** from the app itself. Get the cloud storage experience without Big G.\n\nThe candidates for this are as follows: \n\n1. WebDAV - an old protocol that's quite hard to integrate especially with browser apps\n2. Solid project - a semantic web project from Sir Tim Berners-Lee that proposes *exactly this thing* using Storage Pods, but somehow never has taken off.\n3. Automerge (from Kleppmann and friends) - CRDTs.\n4. A new thing.\n\nI'm researching these options. Lately, I've been gravitating towards option 4. WebDAV is easy to eliminate due to a non-feasible browser story, Solid is as good as dead (sad but expected, given how Semantic Web and WebID never caught on), and Automerge is as compelling as ever if it wasn't for the programming model, especially around schema migrations. CRDTs are somehow very familiar and alien at the same time.\n\nOne important piece of the puzzle is semantics. What do apps need to store? Is it **files**, or maybe **database records** in the SQL sense, or is it some abstract **resources** straight out of Roy Fielding's REST thesis? Different technologies seem to be opinionated towards different base assumptions. At this point, I'm reluctant to point to a single \"model\" that could power 100% of apps.\n\nInstead, I tried to focus on what the programmer would normally expect to have as a backend. And it turns out, an SQL database is a good starting point, but it is not the end. The overarching concept is this:\n\n**An application needs attached resources** in the infrastructural sense, some of which might be an SQL database, a filesystem, or perhaps a notification bus.\n\nA \"personal storage pod\" should make available some resources, and an application should consume them. A personal journal, planner, or To-Do list? It probably needs 1 resource: a plain old SQL database is good enough. A photo gallery app? Filesystem. A cookbook? Might be both - index in a database, food photos in the filesystem (or else you're dealing with blobs in the DB).\n\nThese things are obtainable now - anyone can subscribe to AWS S3 or a competitor and create a bucket and then point a piece of software to it. On the other hand, most people are not in IT and they would rather not manage infrastructure on AWS.\n\nThe user story is, coarsely, this:\n\n1. You sign up with a \"storage pod\" provider (or self-host one)\n2. You try using a new app, Web or traditional\n3. Instead of a typical \"Sign up for free!\" screen, you see \"connect to your pod\".\n4. You go to your pod provider and create a new Workspace.\n5. You copy the Workspace's access token (via a helpful Copy button, very UX-ish) and paste it into the new app from point 2.\n\nWhat do you think about this, in general? Cool idea? Totally unworkable?\n\n  \nSome technical minutiae which might or might not be interesting:\n\nFor the first demo, I've chosen SQLite3 as the backing database. I'm now working on a prototype where a back-end server exposes an SQLite over HTTP, authorizes access using a JSON Web Token (that's the thing the user is meant to Copy/Paste), and loads/stores it as needed. This is multi-tenant with independent lifecycles per tenant, though I'm still working on proper security and isolation.\n\nThe important point is, the database is a single file that the user owns and can download at any time. It can use a local directory or an S3 back-end with tiered persistence. At a high-level, it behaves like a \"serverless\" database (very fashionable, I've heard) - you know this because it has a cold start while it fetches the SQLite file from the archive.\n\nI haven't started work on the filesystem API yet. A major pain point is going to be the quota system - it makes sense to limit users' resource consumption in shared scenarios.\n\n(Sorry if this reads like a brain dump - that's because it is! Let me know your thoughts.)",

Not every feature needs to be a business. Sometimes, software is just software. Doubly so, I believe, in the vibecoding era.\n\n\nFrankly, I wish the browser would expose these APIs. In a way, it does: IndexedDB exists, and I have some personal apps that use it. The trouble, of course, is that it doesn't sync at all. There's useful wrappers like Dexie.js, but start reading the docs and 10 minutes in you realize that online sync is a paid commercial service.\n\n\nTo quote a classic: developers, developers, developers, developers!",

User loads the app, the app connects to their database, checks the version. Outdated? Yep, time to run some DDL (in a single transaction). Done. It gets a little tricky in case of concurrent access, so there might be some fencing required, but the principle still holds: the app just works on this single DB as if the user owns all of it (they do!).\n\n\nAre the pods themselves secure? Maybe. As secure as the user's cloud drive, probably, minus the factor that it's not hosted by FAANG.\n\n\nAbout data ownership: the data logically being the app's and not the user's is somehow very timely. This is just from today: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1rd60go/the_gray_box_problem_of_self_hosting/\n\n\nAnd yes, the average user will struggle to make sense of an SQLite file. On the other hand, even if they do not understand the contents, they can still move it to another provider freely or delete it. Ownership.\n\n\nAbout availability, I think that's a fair point. If the pod is down, it's like the user's hard drive was down. No saving or loading anything. On the other hand, a hosted system like this can possibly be made more available and durable than a local one (\"your laptop\"), and the ability to access the data from more than one device can help mitigate hardware failures on the client end. Of course, the network is one additional thing to fail, and there is no recourse.\n\n\nOverall, there's some trade-offs for sure. Does that make it clearer? It's fair if you still wouldn't touch it, I guess.",

      "text": "There is a thread on r/postgres discussing these features in postgres, and I'm curious on what people are using in practice.\n\nThe features are follows:\n\n\n>`EXCLUDE` constraints: To avoid overlapping time slots\n>\n>If you ever needed to prevent overlapping time slots for the same resource, then the EXCLUDE constraint is extremely useful. It enforces that no two rows can have overlapping ranges for the same key.\n\nI think this is just an example of what `EXCLUDE` can do rather than the specific use case. [This is the postgres documentation on using EXCLUDE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-EXCLUDE)\n\n>`CHECK` constraints: For validating data at the source\n>\n>CHECK constraints allow you to specify that the value in a column must satisfy a Boolean expression. They enforce rules like \"age must be between 0 and 120\" or \"end_date must be after start_date.\"\n\n[This is the postgres documentation on using CHECK](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-CHECK-CONSTRAINTS)\n\nI'm personally wary of pushing my business logic into the database.  I don't want my database responsible for checking constraints - if anything is reaching the database it should be validated in the business logic before reaching the data store.  I've always followed the 'keep my business logic decoupled' rule when I've built out applications.\n\nI'm curious what other people are doing in practice. Do you rely on these database level features for constraining the values that get stored within the database? Or do you maintain this solely in the business logic?",

The goal is to create \"agent-ready\" architectural artifacts that we can feed into a Git-based context warehouse. Once the architecture is locked, autonomous LLM agents read those files to generate the epics, user stories, and eventually the code itself.\n\nTo stop the AI from hallucinating system boundaries and dependencies, we’ve completely banned visual-only tools like [Draw.io](http://Draw.io) or Miro exports. Everything has to be \"machine-first\"—meaning text-to-diagram code embedded inside Markdown documents.\n\nMy current plan is to standardize on the **C4 Model** using **Mermaid.js** or **Structurizr DSL**, alongside strict **Markdown ADRs** (MADR) and **OpenAPI/AsyncAPI** for contracts. Since LLMs have a lot of training data on C4 and Mermaid, it seems like the safest bet.\n\nBut I’m wondering if we are just shoehorning a human legacy framework into an AI workflow.\n\n**My questions for the community:**\n\n1. Is there a better architectural framework or DSL emerging specifically for human-AI collaboration?\n2. Have you found any schemas (YAML/JSON/Markdown hybrids) that give LLM agents better semantic understanding of data flows and system constraints than Mermaid?\n\nWould love to hear how others are solving this \"human-to-machine\" architecture handoff!",

I think with AI agents the automation aspect is now solved to a degree, and I think using much simpler models like C4 is a good compromise that lets both the human and AI align on architecture.\n\nI'm building a tool specifically for this: [https://github.com/aklos/scryer](https://github.com/aklos/scryer) \\- it's definitely early and experimental, but AI agents have no issue converting my models into code as long as I define good contract rules (the always/ask/never paradigm), and letting the AI build a model from code is surprisingly easy with an embedded MCP server.",

          "text": "In a use case diagram, each actor represents a role that a user takes on. For instance, a bank teller can use bank software, and that very same person might also interact with that bank software as a customer of the bank with a bank account.\n\nOne role can be a more specific kind of another. For example, there might be some uses of the bank system that all employees can do, and some uses that are specific to bank tellers only. In that case, a bank teller is a specific kind of employee—they can do all the employee things, but employees cannot do all of the teller things. \n\nAnother thing you need to think about is what a use case actually is. You have \"sign up\" and \"log in\" on your list of use cases. Keep in mind that a use case is \"the smallest usage of the system\" by an actor to accomplish something meaningful.\n\nThis means that signing up might be considered a use case because it's conceivable that a user would sign up and then go on about their day, they accomplished what they wanted to accomplish.\n\nNow think about logging in. Does anyone log in to the system and think, \"Great, I got that taken care of!\" and then go on with their day? Nope, that doesn't make sense. \n\nA lot of times when you sketch out use cases, you'll find that many different use cases share a common bit like logging in. In this case, you can factor out the common bit, but that doesn't make it a use case, that makes it a sub-use case—a common interaction with the system, but not a \"whole usage\" of it. \n\nIt's possible for a sub-use case to also be a use case, as in the example of signing up. Someone might sign up and leave, but then again you might want a sign up flow for some users that enter the system without an existing account, but they entered with intent to do a specific thing. The shop app has this where you can be directed to it from a company website to complete an order and then complete that part of the sale as a guest, by logging in to your shop account first, or by signing up and logging in first. \n\nIt's important to capture all of this complexity because you want your use case diagram to present all of the context in which each \"event\" can happen. A signup that happens just as a single, standalone interaction might have a completely different meaning to the business than one that happens in the context of a larger use case. A common mistake is to think that \"a signup is a signup is a signup\" … a key thing the use case diagram is supposed to capture is the various contexts in which a signup can happen specifically because this is not true.\n\nIt's better, by the way, to diagram out use cases without trying to factor out all of the things that, in your mind, have associated \"architecture.\" For instance, you might be tempted to factor out login as a sub-use case because you know there will be an auth module in the architecture, so obviously if it gets its own module, it's shared by many flows. But you're doing architecture in reverse here, not based on the needs of the users, but based on the tools you have decided to use. The problem with this is that you'll oftentimes not question whether a specific use case requires logging in, you'll just include it. But there will be those cases where, oops, you weren't thinking from the user's perspective, and now you're making everyone log in when it doesn't make sense, or when you could've provided a better experience but just inadvertantly shoved everyone down the same flow. (This doesn't mean don't make compromises, it means don't make compromises unconsciously. Do the pros and cons.)\n\nThis specific example of logging in was a big problem in the past when OAuth rolled out years ago and sites wanted to start letting people log in with their Google accounts. Because they made a bunch of assumptions about how login is done, a lot of auth modules had APIs that couldn't easily be changed for new login methods. Now there's mobile login with biometrics, security keys, round tripping with SMS or email, etc. Even something as prosaic as login can disrupt your entire system if your architecture doesn't reflect the user experience.\n\nWhen you're done, it may feel incomplete because you've listed out use cases, but for your app it might be the case that no one *really* uses the app this way. Your users might not do the minimal interaction and leave like they're using an ATM, they might frequently do many interactions in a typical session. This is fine, this just means you need to define another look at the system that define the critical user journeys through your system. Use cases are like the atoms of interaction, but there may be opportunities to take a larger view based on what real users actually do and smooth the experience, but from an architectural standpoint you still want to build the different parts of those common journeys in a way that robustly supports the most basic usages of the system.",
