      "text": "My company went fully remote in early 2023. I was excited at first. No more commute, no more pretending to look busy, I could actually focus on work. That lasted maybe three months.\n\nI don't know when it started but at some point I stopped using my desk entirely. It became a place to dump laundry. Every morning I would just grab my laptop and sink into the couch. Then the couch became my office, my lunch spot, my Netflix spot, my everything spot. I was replying to slack messages at 11pm in the same position I woke up in. Last month my manager asked me to turn on my camera for a call and I realized I was literally horizontal. I had to pretend my camera was broken because I could not sit up fast enough without it being weird.\n\nI started seeing a therapist a few weeks ago, mostly for anxiety stuff. At some point I mentioned how I felt like I was drifting through days and she asked me where I work. I said the couch. She kind of laughed and said something like, your brain can not tell the difference between work and rest if you never move. It sounded too simple to actually matter but it stuck with me.\n\nSo last week I cleared a corner in my bedroom. Got an old desk off marketplace for 40 bucks. Bought an actual desk chair because the dining chair was killing my back. First morning sitting there felt stupid honestly. Like I was playing pretend office. But I also finished more actual work by noon than I had in weeks. I am not saying it fixed everything. Some days I still end up back on the couch by 3pm. But at least now I notice when it happens.\n\nTwo years of drifting and the answer was literally just sitting somewhere else. Wild how that works. ",

It’s easy to go days without leaving the house when you wfh so for me even just a 20 minute walk with my dog makes a huge difference. \n\nI also sometimes will take a drive after work.

Your therapist nailed something most productivity advice completely misses - the neuroscience of context switching. \n\nWhen you have ADHD, your prefrontal cortex (executive function center) already struggles with task switching and focus regulation. Working from the same spot you relax creates what researchers call \"contextual interference\" - your brain literally can't figure out which mode it should be in. \n\nI went through the exact same couch spiral during remote work. The game changer for me wasn't just changing locations, but understanding WHY it works: ADHD brains rely heavily on environmental cues for dopamine regulation and attention control. New location = brain recognizes \"work context\" and starts producing the right neurochemicals. \n\nYour $40 marketplace desk probably did more for your executive function than any productivity app ever could. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most powerful because they work WITH your brain instead of against it. \n\nThe fact that you notice when you drift back to the couch by 3pm shows you've built real self-awareness. That noticing is actually a huge ADHD skill - most of us operate on autopilot and don't realize we've switched contexts until hours later.",

These few small things helped me to get used to get up first thing after waking up, and get going. Now I have some what of a routine, where I do excercise shower, eat and check phone, and leave home. There isnt enough time in the day as is, and the best thing to help me avoid brain rot is to follow that usual advice: Get tough tasks out of the way, which means getting my blood puming. Its not for everyone, but it works, where as phone is just prime the brain for media consumption and no thinking which sets up the so so day.",

Then in the morning, the first thing I do is make my bed. Then I drink water and go stretch because my body was frozen in place for 7-8 hours. Then I meditate for five minutes, followed by writing a journal entry of what I want to do that day. Meditation is a must.

      "text": "*\"I can't focus during lectures anymore\"*\n\n*\"Why is studying so hard now?\"*\n\n*\"I used to be a good student but can't concentrate for even 20 minutes\"*\n\nMany students are genuinely confused. They're following the typical study methods (in some cases, methods they've used for a long time), but finding it harder and harder to retain information, sit through a lecture without mentally drifting, or read more than a page without reaching for their phone.\n\nWhat students are experiencing is born out in the data. Dr. Gloria Mark's research tracked our declining attention spans:\n\nThe average college student now checks social media 118 times per day.\n\nBut the problem's rooted in something deeper than just your study sessions. Count how many things you're doing simultaneously throughout they day:\n\n* Walking to class while responding to texts\n* Eating while watching Shorts\n* Studying with friends while everyone scrolls phones\n* Listening to lectures while browsing different Reddit subs\n\nIf you're struggling to focus in class or while studying, I'm willing to bet almost **all** of your day is filled with this type of rapid multitasking and context switching. (It's really about the context-switching: the rapid and constant jumping from screen to screen, tab to tab, app to app, swipe to swipe.)\n\nBecause every moment you're switching contexts, you're training your brain to need constant stimulation. Your neural pathways literally rewire to reject sustained focus.\n\nSome call this 'popcorn brain' — your mind constantly jumping from thought to thought, unable to settle on any single task. Like kernels popping erratically in every direction, your attention bounces around without control.\n\nThen you try to read a textbook chapter and your brain physically rebels, because you've spent the other 15 hours of your day training it to do the exact opposite. And you wonder why you can't focus when you need to.\n\nThe fix is simple but not easy: Single-task throughout your day as much as possible, not just during study time. Read without music. Walk without podcasts. Eat without screens. One tab open for assignments.\n\nYes, it feels uncomfortable. Your brain will crave stimulation. That discomfort means you're rebuilding your attention span.\n\nMost study advice focuses on those 2-3 hours of dedicated study time. But if the rest of your day trains your brain for fractured attention and constant novel stimulation, you're fighting a losing battle.",

I have a couple of them back on my phone but I find I'm a little better at keeping the doomscrolling in check. I also found audiobooks and podcast to be a huge problem for me. They're fine in moderation but I reached a point where I was losing it if I had to do so much as wash a few dishes without a YouTube video or audiobook playing in the background and I don't think that's healthy so I started forcing myself to do stuff without it. I still listen to audiobooks if I'm deep cleaning, on a long run or cooking something that takes a long time but we feel the need to be entertained literally 24/7 and have way too much media available at all times and I dont think the constant stimuli is healthy.",

It's that your brain is already running at capacity from all the invisible decisions underneath the tasks. What to make for dinner, who's handling pickup, is that email urgent, should I say something about the mess, which bill to pay first. None of those are hard individually but they never stop.\n\nRest doesn't fix it because the decisions keep accumulating even when you're \"resting.\" Your brain is still running the queue in the background. What actually helped me was getting aggressive about removing decisions, not tasks. Same meals on rotation, automatic bill pay, a shared calendar where things just appear instead of being negotiated every time. Sounds boring but it bought me the first actual rest I'd had in months.",

I know that to reach that point, I need to put in the work. I am okay with putting in the work, and want to improve myself. But my brain *literally* refuses to listen to me. I have to negotiate with it 24/7 to even convince myself to do the work. This leaves me exhausted when I have to do the actual work that I end up half-assing it. Why does this happen?\n\nWhy can my brain not understand where I want to go? It does 2 things. It either negotiates with me, saying that we can do it in 5 min, etc. Else, it begins pulling up receipts of people who are better than me in that skill, and begins comparing and saying that I can never be like them. And I have to tell myself, \"Yeah, you can never be like them if you don't put in the work. Do the work and you can be like them too\". But my brain is like, \"But they have 3 years of experience, you can never have that\" and this goes on and on until either my brain or I give up, and by then, both of us are exhausted.\n\nThe thing is, this isn't consistent at all. I cannot consistently code for a week, but I have been tracking calories for 400 days now without a break. I can power through the boredom of getting better in a task and practice shooting as a sport, but I cannot read a boring textbook which is needed to understand a subject I am interested in. I absolutely hate this inconsistency with myself and I view it as a sign of weakness.\n\nHow do I make my brain consistent in being disciplined? How can I make my brain not negotiate with me and exhaust me? How do I fulfill promises made to myself? How can I get started to put the effort to where I want to be?",

Often esp for neurodivergent types, the task initiation and executive dysfunction are majority causes for productivity, and just starting no matter how small can snowball into productive time. \n\nI often trick myself into doing something, but telling letting myself feel the motions and whilst im feelings, i tell myself 'look i know i feel like i cant do this all now, but at minimum i can move this dirty pile of clothes into hamper, or take the glass to the sink.' then when im there and doing something my brain can easily accommodate another task because the dopamine hit from accomplishing a teeny tiny task is enough motivation to go further. \n\nanother thing to do, is to have planner, and then when trying to do a task you dont want to, like going to the gym. You trick your brain with sidequests and sidethoughts. Like pack the gym bag, get water, get dressed. Focus all your attention on the setting up of the task, then take that small step/leap into doing something/anything and often the rest will follow. The trick here is to overload your brain with thoughts other than those of the task, so that when you get to the gym and already there you might as well do soemthing even if its small, and it snowballs. IF your brain cant have the time to have an emotional crisis over the task and its implications, your brain cant fully lock you out of doing it. \n\nIf you write out a goal and a process to achieve it, you can break down the tasks into small tasks, and take it one small step at a time. If you ever get overwhelmed, take the 5-55min to feel it if you need, and then take a small step forward. Eventually it will be easy to overcome your own brain with these small steps and trickery. \n\nAnd thats discipline in a nutshell, doing things when we said we would do, through mental gymastics to over come executive dysfunctione tc.",

You're attempting to force yourself to do something you're not truly interested in or passionate about.\n\n> I can power through the boredom of getting better in a task and practice shooting as a sport\n\nSounds like you're interested in the task. Sounds like you have a knack for weapons.\n\n> but I cannot read a boring textbook which is needed to understand a subject I am interested in. I absolutely hate this inconsistency with myself and I view it as a sign of weakness. \n\nBut you're perhaps lying to yourself in saying that you care about this \"subject\".\n\nFor context, I worked on some game jams and pushed myself to code for like 12+ hours a day for 7 days a week, because I was having fun and wanted the result. I enjoyed the process and the potential outcome. If I didn't enjoy the process or the outcome, I wouldn't have done it.\n\nI don't particularly like programming. I've dabbled with it for an eternity, but have never shipped any really applications. But I love making games. So it tracks.\n\nI also try to tell myself I love all video games and I love playing them. I own nearly 1,500 of them. I've played maybe 300 of them. I tell myself to play the games, but I find myself burning out of playing certain kinds of them. I watch YouTube videos of others playing these types of games, but I just can't pull myself to push through and play them. Am I just wasting money? Most definitely at this point.\n\nSo yeah, maybe you just need to have a deeper look at yourself and be honest: do you sincerely enjoy the \"subjects\" you are focusing on? If it is, you shouldn't need to struggle with motivation to do them. The motivation should be built in.\n\nIf you're struggling to find the motivation, you need to have a moment of reflection and ask if you're really focusing your efforts on something that you really want to do. Because if it's not something you want to do, maybe it's worth asking if you should shift your focus towards something you can be more passionate about and have better outcomes from natural desire to do those things.\n\nAnyways, that's just my two cents.",

But this is where I learned the countdown method. Alarm goes off? Countdown from three and just get up when you say “1”. It really helps your brain from not talking you out of doing whatever you were suddenly motivated to do. \n\n“Doing a task for at least 15 minutes” is a good thing to add on to the “countdown method”. \n\nScenario: “shoot I need to finish this work before my presentation next week.” Ok… 3, 2, 1, and I’m up! I immediately go to my clean and organized desk with the mindset that I’ll just do 15 minutes of work. I still use these two methods to do something when I don’t feel like it, but the intended 15 minutes of work now turns into hours of solid focus. \n\nDo this even on weekends, when you don’t have plans…. Training your mind to do something as soon as you have the motivation to do it, changes something in your brain and that consistent effort paired with even the slightest progress every day accumulates over time.",

Yeah, coffee time (I love coffee). Actually wrote down my plan for the next class? Yeah, snack time. Spend 1h grading student works? Yeah, time to grab my wife's butt and steal a kiss. Etc etc.\n\n4. We aren't meant to be working 8 or 10h a day. Realistically, we have maybe 3 to 5 good effective hours of work in ourself for a day. Not much more. So, days are short, and we have to select what we do of our energy. If you spent 2h shooting, 1h working in your diet, there's just no way you'll be able to code for 3 or 4h. You'll be tired, seeking anything that can distract you. And it's normal.",

Just this 24 hrs. Even divide that 24 hrs to 4 portions.\nUse Time blocker ,pomodoro techniques.\nMost importantly Just keep going. Brain requires 8 min to adapt to anything .\nI was obese .

The switch is broken, stimulants help flip that switch. That allows your brain to signal to your muscles to start moving in order to get the thing done. \n\nIt’s frustrating as hell but knowing what’s going on helps you find tricks to get around it. External motivation helps: a deadline, money, friend, social obligation, etc.\n\nRoutine is another powerful one too. Much easier for your brain to tell your body what to do if it’s used to doing it regularly. Use treats or stimulants to help establish the routine and make lifestyle changes that can help you with or without medication.\n\nLook up PDA, it’s a characteristic of many adhd folks. Pathological demand avoidance, or persistent drive for autonomy. It’s like your brains fear wires get crossed with the demands because of past trauma when demands seemed insurmountable so now any demand feels like a threat to your nervous system which leads to avoidance. \n\nPerfectionist tendencies play in as well, you want to wait for the “perfect” time to do something or don’t want to do something you anticipate not being able to do perfectly.\n\nFind ways to follow your interests and channel them to get things done. Use your intellect to overcome executive function disabilities, be resourceful and creative to find work arounds. Good luck, you seem to be on the right track.",

Talk to a counseller first and possibly tune your sleep cycle (going to the gym the same time helped me back then, got me tired enough to shower and sleep) \n\nSecond, when learning tech the first time it's important to apply tech on something you are interested, create your own website with the stuff you learnt   \n\nThirdly, try different learning styles, one person's style is different from another, some prefer visuals others prefer hands on. If you are learning a programming language outside study, learning from textbook is very inefficient, try following an online tutorial on CRUD instead and add your creativity in it.   \n\nAlso, know that your brain is like a muscle, it takes small repetition for it to remember, so take a few minutes to tell yourself what does a piece of information is trying to teach you. \n\nRecord what concepts or techniques you learn, not how many problems you solved.

No tweaking allowed during that block.\n\nI also reduced my daily plan to just one “must move” task. Not a full list. Just the one thing that, if progressed, makes the day count. Everything else became optional.\n\nIt felt uncomfortable at first because the system wasn’t polished. But I realized I was polishing the container instead of filling it. Progress improved once I accepted that the starting point will almost always feel slightly messy.",

It gives a small dopamine hit without the emotional risk of actually starting.\n\nThe trap is this: preparation has no natural finish line. You can always refine the system one more time.\n\nHere are a few things that actually break the loop:\n\n1. Cap planning time aggressively Give yourself 10 to 15 minutes max to plan. Set a timer. When it rings, you must start the first task, even if the plan feels imperfect. Constraints create action.\n2. Define a “messy first action” Instead of preparing to work, start badly on purpose. Open the document and write a rough paragraph. Solve one tiny piece. Send the imperfect draft. Momentum kills overplanning.\n3. Separate planning days from execution blocks Have one weekly reset where you reorganize everything. Outside of that, you are not allowed to redesign the system. You only execute.\n4. Replace “optimize” with “ship” Ask yourself: what can I finish in the next 30 minutes that would move this forward? Not improve the structure. Not refine the workflow. Finish.\n5. Track output, not organization At the end of the day, measure visible results. Pages written. Problems solved. Emails sent. If it is not output, it does not count.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is this: clarity comes from action, not from better planning.\n\nIf this hit home, you would probably love 60-Second Productivity.\n\nIt is a weekly newsletter built for people who want to stop circling productivity and actually experience it. Each week you get one actionable tip you can apply immediately, no long reads, no theory spirals.\n\nIf you are tired of preparing to start and ready to actually move, subscribe here: [https://60secondproductivity.substack.com/](https://60secondproductivity.substack.com/)\n\nOne minute a week.

I block everything which isn't important. Even things which may be important I block, because you can still use these apps for 5 mins. I keep my phone out of view.\n* Changing my pc setup: I have multiple users for different work on my pc. On my \"work user\" I don't have distracting apps installed or files nearby. I block everything. Additionally, I might install a visible blocker at my desk, so I can't get distracted by my surroundings.\n* More important to me is my calendar. I plan my day every evening for the next day. Then while working, I time track my tasks and have them automatically transfer to my calendar. This allows me to see how good I did and If I need to improve my planning. The tracking also adds friction, because when I for example want to watch YouTube instead of working, I first have to stop the timer and then start a new one. I also then see it in my calendar that I didn't adhere to my goals and allowed my procrastination. This visualization is key to me. This workflow really boosted my productivity.",

          "text": "Honestly most productivity “secrets” are boring and kind of unsexy. The big one for me is designing my day so I do not have to rely on willpower. If I have to fight myself every hour I will lose. So I make the right thing the easy thing. Phone in another room. Laptop with only the tab I need open. Clear desk. Water next to me. I remove decisions before I start. Second is starting before I feel ready. Waiting to feel focused is a trap. I set a small entry point like ten minutes and I begin even if my brain feels scattered. Nine times out of ten focus shows up after action not before. The first few minutes are friction. If you survive that, momentum takes over.\n\nThird is single tasking aggressively. No music with lyrics. No multitasking. No checking messages “quickly.” I treat attention like something fragile. Once it fractures it takes way more energy to rebuild than people realize. So I protect it hard. Another underrated one is tracking output not time. Instead of “I studied three hours” it becomes “I finished two problem sets” or “I wrote 800 words.” It shifts you from sitting there to actually producing. Time can be faked. Output cannot.\n\nAnd finally I respect my energy. I do hard things when my brain is sharp and easy admin when I am tired. A lot of people try to brute force deep work at 10 pm and then think they have a discipline issue. Sometimes it is just bad timing. You already named strong ones. Limiting phone use is huge. Quiet is powerful. Classical works because it removes verbal interference. The real theme behind all of this is the same though. Control your environment and lower friction. Focus is less about forcing your brain and more about removing what pulls it away.",

For example, I write for fun and just recently got a decent text transcriber app to be able to plot while I am on the go.\n\n  \nConstraints:\n\n* I would really prefer free resources. If there's something that you MUST recommend that costs money, I'd greatly appreciate it if it was under 10$/month or under 35$ if it's a one-time payment.\n* I greatly prefer media that is long-form content. Ideally 1-hour chunks so I can 'load' it before leaving and finish an entire 'episode.'\n\nRequests:\n\n* I would love to have an app that I can use to take voice notes while watching the aforementioned media.\n* I am still on the market for an actually decent transcriber app. The one I am using currently doesn't like my accent, and I would love to be able to say \"next line\" and \"period\" and have the thing actually do it.\n* Something semi-active for me to do once in a while would be great. (Obviously something that is safe to do while driving)\n* If there's ANY way to make any money it would be great; but I know that's a really high bar. \n\nGeneral Interests:\n\n* Money, Money Management and Investing.\n* Ideas for passive income\n* Marketing\n* Graphic Design\n* Drawing and Anime\n* Storytelling\n* Writing\n* Fantasy and Worldbuilding\n* Language Learning channels (Japanese and French specifically)\n* Table Top RPG's and how to make them\n\nAnd finally, in the interest of not burning myself out, I'd love to hear what you listen to for fun.\n\n",

For example, one week just negotiation, next week just investing basics. It reduces mental switching and makes the commute feel like a mini course.\n\nFor voice notes, I’ve had decent luck just using a simple recorder app and batching the transcription later instead of fighting live formatting. Trying to say “comma” and “next line” while driving would probably stress me out more than it helps. I’d separate capture from clean up.\n\nFor something semi active but safe, I like “mental reps.” After a podcast episode, I’ll summarize it out loud in my own words or imagine how I’d apply one idea to my current situation. It turns passive listening into processing without needing a screen.\n\nIf you want a money angle, you could document what you’re learning. Voice note summaries that later turn into short posts, essays, or even a niche newsletter. You’re already consuming the material, so you’re just extracting a second layer of value from it.\n\nAnd for fun, I rotate in storytelling podcasts or fantasy audiobooks so it doesn’t all feel like self optimization. If every commute becomes “improvement time,” burnout creeps in fast. Mixing growth with genuine enjoyment keeps it sustainable.",

I find nonfiction particularly easy because it feels like a podcast a lot of the time. In under a year, I went from Norm Mcdonld’s book to the 800 page Lonsome Dove audiobook! It’s worth it!\n\nHell of Presidents is a fantastic short history podcast tht is funny and gripping.  Michael Jamin has an okay podcast that can serve as an introduction to writing.

          "text": "My suggestion has two part benefits, benefits for when driving, then benefits for when home. \n\nThe app “Waking Up” is centered on starting and improving your meditation practice. When you first get the app, it will suggest you start the 30 day (I think it’s 30 days, can’t remember exactly) meditation intro course. \n\nWhen I started the intro course, I had attempted meditation prior, but felt that “my ADHD won’t let me” and “my brain just talks too much and meditation isn’t for me”. By the time I had completed the entire intro course, I was meditating (using other offered guided meditations on the app) for 20+ mins a day, and I was seeing real improvements. I started the intro course probably six months ago, and am now meditating for about 45-60mins a day, and it’s truly changed my life. I’m so grateful I gave it an honest shot! The guided meditations offered on the app are all created and guided by actual “pro meditators”/monks/etc. NOT just actors and actresses reading from a script. That has been my biggest turn off from using other popular meditation apps, is that they just have “famous people” reading the guided meditations. The Waking Up app has only people who personally practice meditation or study Buddhist philosophy create and narrate their meditation sessions. \n\nThat being said, the meditation piece of the app would not be safe for driving! But would be great for once you get to your destination. I like doing a short 10 min meditation after I get off work and complete my hour drive home, but before I exit my car to walk to my apartment. It helps “divide” my day, signifying the end to my workday. \n\nThe second part of the app that would be useful for when driving, is all of the long-form audio the app offers. \n\nWaking Up has so much long-form content that spans so many subjects, under the general umbrella of “self improvement”. From talks with Buddhist monks, to neuroscientists explaining how plasticity in the brain works, to discussion topics on Stoicism, to talks on how to implement various forms of therapy into your everyday life (CBT, DBT, etc). The creator of the app is Sam Harris, a neuroscientist and meditation leader himself. All of the additional long-form audio content is ALL useful, and curated to where if you are someone with any interest in personal development and improving quality of life, you will really enjoy most of everything they have. \n\nThe app is usually $19.99 a month, however if you email the Waking Up app and request “financial assistance” due to not being able to afford the cost, they will give you a year subscription for free. At the end of that year, if you continue to need the financial assistance, just email and request again and you get another year. No limit on how many times to request assistance. \n\nThe Waking Up app is one of the very few apps to truly inspire and create change in my life. I am so grateful I gave it a shot, and I recommend it to everyone now. \n\nGood luck on your journey!",

With a vague task (project in my comment) I just cannot see the start of the path, it is covered by thick vegetation or low cloud = no way into the project.\n\nI find that I ignore the start of such tasks or projects and seek out some simple task related to the area of the project that may or may not end up being wholly relevent. Such as document review around the project area. It might not go into the finished output of the project but it is something I can actually start and do. I find doing something simple around the project always leads to finding the start of the path to the end.\n\nThere is a term for this I think but I cannot recall. It is about feeling like you are doing something and freeing the mind on the task by doing not thinking so hard. I think vague tasks or projects (without scope adequately defined) leads to procrastination by overthinking it. A simple, even five or ten minute work close to the task area stops this and I end up moving more into the task or project with momentum.\n\nIn summary I notice this pattern too. I think for me vagueness comes partly from it not being defined in the scope, but also if it feels like you need to carry out some threshold task to define it. Such as needing to contact someone new or senior in the area the work is related to without a clear ask in order to find the information to define the task clearly. That is with me at least since I do not like seeking help or making new contacts (introverted perhaps) and an overly respectful attitude towards those much higher up the food chain than I!! Too busy to deal with me surely. An issue I have worked on a lot more over the last year or so.",

So I went from sitting at home most of the time or sitting in a lecture hall to standing most of the day and doing handiwork. I like my job and most of the time it’s not that physical exhausting. But after work I literally can’t do anything. Once I sit down at my desk I feel too „weak“ to do anything that requires any focus. When I open a game I just run in circles and don’t properly play because I don’t really feel like doing anything specific and I don’t even try to draw because I can’t think of something. Yesterday I sat down at the couch and talked to my partner after work like we usually do and I instantly fell asleep after they got up to do something. I ended up sleeping for two hours and them making food even tho cooking is usually my responsibility. I feel guilty and bad if I do nothing. I wanna draw more since I wanna do art professionally some day, even if not as my main job, but also gaming is my way of socializing on weekdays but not being able to game because I‘m so exhausted is sad. I sleep enough and I eat rather healthy most of the time, the last time I got bloodwork done was a year ago and the results were fine. I want more meaningful free time. It’s not like I give 110% at work and over exhaust myself. What are things I can do to get more energy? I don’t spend a lot of time on social media (I have limited screen time on everything, 20 mins) and I don’t drink coffee, so it’s not like I’m feeling the caffeine low after work. The only thing I can think of is that I‘m rather unfit, I lost a lot of weight because I dieted so I look slim but I have no stamina nor strength. Any help is appreciated!!",

A balanced circadian rhythm makes it easier to sleep early at night, and wake up early in the morning. So do this in addition:\n\n5. Wake up early in the morning, 30 grams of protein in 30 minutes waking, and walk for 30 minutes (bath yourself in sun light). You dont need a perfect 8 hours of sleep to start doing this. 3 - 4 hours can do it. This is the reset/maintain of circadian rhythm part\n\n6. Add a zone 2 heart rate training, 20-30 minutes, or any type of training. This helps you sleep better at night since it's slowing your resting heart rate, making it more restful to sleep (improving sleep quality/deep sleep)",

Tell yourself you will only draw for 60 seconds .. like just one stick figure or a circle. Usually, the 'freeze' happens because the brain reads a big goal as a threat when you're tired.

          "text": "What you’re describing actually makes a lot of sense. You went from a mostly sedentary life to standing and doing handiwork all day. Even if it doesn’t feel “intensely physical,” your body is still adapting. Low level physical fatigue plus mental adjustment can hit harder than people expect. It’s not dramatic exhaustion, it’s just this flat drained feeling where your brain doesn’t want to initiate anything. The first thing I’d look at is basic physical capacity. You said you’re slim but unfit. That matters more than people realize. If your baseline stamina and strength are low, your job is taking a bigger percentage of your total energy. When your capacity is small, normal effort feels huge. Building even moderate strength and cardio can change that. Not extreme workouts. Just 2 to 3 short strength sessions a week and maybe light cardio. Over time your job will feel easier and you’ll have more left in the tank.\n\nSecond, stop going straight from work mode to “creative performance” mode. Your brain probably needs a transition. Right now you sit down and expect yourself to draw something meaningful or properly game. That’s pressure when you’re already tired. Try a 20 to 30 minute reset after work. Quick walk. Shower. Lie down with eyes closed but don’t sleep. Small snack with protein and carbs. Let your nervous system come down. Then choose one small intentional thing. Not “draw for two hours.” Just sketch for 15 minutes. Not “game all evening.” Just one match. Reduce the activation energy. Also, be careful with the after work nap. A two hour crash nap can make you groggier and steal your evening. If you really need it, set a 20 to 30 minute timer. Keep it short. Long naps can make the whole evening feel foggy.\n\nAnd honestly, some of this might just be an adjustment phase. Six months feels long but your body and brain are still adapting to a different rhythm of life. You are not lazy. You are adapting. The guilt is probably draining more energy than the job. You’re judging yourself for being tired instead of working with it. Instead of trying to have “perfect meaningful evenings,” aim for one intentional action per night. One sketch. One proper game session. One small step toward art. That keeps the identity alive without demanding superhero energy. If you build your physical base a bit, add a transition ritual, shorten naps, and lower the pressure on your hobbies, I think you’ll start feeling more in control of your evenings. Right now it sounds less like a motivation problem and more like a capacity and recovery problem. And those can actually be improved.",

A lot of what you’re describing sounds like physical fatigue bleeding into mental fog.\n\nTwo things I’d look at:\n\nFirst, baseline fitness and fueling. if you dieted down and lost muscle, your body may just not have much reserve. Light strength training 2 to 3 times a week and making sure you’re actually eating enough, especially protein and carbs around work, can change energy levels more than people expect.\n\nSecond, transition rituals. If you sit down immediately after work, your body might interpret that as shutdown mode. A 20 minute walk, shower, or quick reset routine before hobbies can help you shift gears instead of crashing.\n\nAlso, don’t underestimate sleep quality vs sleep length. even “enough hours” can still be low quality if your schedule is off.\n\nIf you could change one thing first, i’d start with building a little strength back. more capacity usually equals more usable energy.",

Overthinking is the problem that is an obsessive type of behaviour.\n\nBy taking away the thinking and being scared of your thoughts you take away the chance for self improvement and healing. You would start having poor sleep or nightmares because your subconscious is doing all of the heavy lifting now to get the message across. If by end of the day you don’t have any space for reflection, then how are you going to learn from your mistakes? How are you going to understand why you feel how you feel?\n\nThere’s no visible harm with listening to music all day, but it would likely impact your long term future by affecting your potentials for happiness and maintaining a healthy relationship with others.\n\nTry meditation, start with guided meditation and aim for silent meditation. If your thoughts are killing you, it might be worth getting yourself checked sometimes in the future. It’s common for ADHD patients but don’t fall into the self diagnosis trap that is becoming very prevalent these days.",

It’s almost like a countdown and usually takes me about 10 minutes. \n\nI think this helps me because I know there is an END to the cleaning… also, I’m a mom of a 3 and 5 year old so things become out of place VERY often. If you’re kid free then 100 might be too high of a number. Lol\n\nMy house stays so much more tidy this way! Hope this might be helpful to someone. 🫶🏻",

          "text": "The “break your day into 4 days” idea can work, but not because it magically creates time. It works because it creates psychological resets.\n\nInstead of thinking “this whole day is overwhelming,” you think in blocks. Morning block. Midday block. Afternoon block. Evening block. Each one has its own tiny win condition. When one block ends, you mentally close it and start fresh.\n\nWhat’s helped me more than anything though is defining what makes a day successful before it starts. If everything feels important, your brain freezes. So I pick one primary task that, if done, makes the day a win. Everything else is secondary.\n\nAlso, when I feel like I’m drowning, it’s usually because my task list is unstructured. I’ll do a quick brain dump, then sort into three buckets: must do, should do, nice to do. Most of the stress drops once I see that not everything is urgent.\n\nAnother underrated tactic is setting a clear stop time. If there’s no boundary, work expands forever and you never feel caught up. A defined shutdown ritual helps your brain relax.\n\nIf you’re consistently overwhelmed, it might not be a tactics issue. It might be a volume issue. Sometimes productivity isn’t about squeezing more out of the day. It’s about cutting something.",

If I finish it, cool, that block was solid. The rest is extra. Otherwise you just spend the day moving things around and feeling busy but nothing really done. Been there.\n\nTimers help too. Not in a robotic way. Just 30 or 45 mins, phone away, do the thing. When it rings I stand up even if I don’t want to. It kind of resets your head. Like shaking an Etch A Sketch.\n\nAlso random but vague tasks are the worst. Work on business means nothing. Write 200 words means something. Your brain needs edges.\n\nMost days aren’t about being super productive anyway. It’s just about not spiralling. Keep it simple. Win small blocks. Repeat.",

Awake\n2. Asleep\n\nWithin the waking part of our day, I like to group things into 3 imaginary buckets:\n\n1. **Work** (job, school, chores, etc.)\n2. **Passion** (hobbies etc.)\n3. **Play** (unplug & do whatever)\n\nThis means:\n\n* I have a limited time budget each day, so I can't do *everything*\n* I have a limited energy budget each day, so I have to be selective about *what* I work on & *when* I work on it because my energy isn't always available\n* I have to be *selective* about which steps I choose to add to my day\n\nImagine a room with 2 items on the wall:\n\n1. A blank chalkboard\n2. A blank whiteboard\n\nThe title of the chalkboard is \"ROO Pressure\", which stands for:\n\n1. Responsibilities\n2. Opportunities\n3. Obligations\n\nThis creates \"emotional prioritization\", where we feel **pressured** to do things.  Instead, we can choose to use \"logical prioritization\", which is where we pick steps from the ROO chalkboard, or rather, manually approve what we choose to add to our personal whiteboard.  This allows us **vote** each item in by *choice*, not by *emotional pressure*.  The difference is:\n\n* We work on *selected steps*, NOT ideas\n* We select a finite number of steps in order to create a realistic daily schedule\n* WE dictate priority based on the order we put each step in.  Low priority = fewer steps later in the day; high-priority = more steps earlier in the day.  NOT based on how how much *emotional pressure* we are receiving internally!\n\nFour steps to task execution:\n\n1. Use reliable reminders (calendar entries, multiple named alarms, etc.)\n2. Have a clean, prepared workstation\n3. Use, literally, *written* tasks\n4. Use a body double (#1 productivity tool!!)\n\nImagine the opposite:\n\n* *Zero* written assignments\n* Exposure to ALL assignments (\"drinking from the firehose\" = overwhelming)\n* No preselected, finite list of tasks that can ne realistically achieved today (otherwise we create literally Failure Mode in our minds)\n* List not put in order of importance\n* No reminders\n* Messy workstation where the tools & supplies aren't ready to go\n* Work without the help needed to stay on track (working solo allows our brain to let us off the hook!)\n\nOur job is simply to manage OUR blank whiteboard:\n\n* What steps are we *willing* to vote into that blank space today?\n* Are we willing to *manually prioritize* via sequential ordering?\n* Are we willing to be **selective** about how many steps we pick each day, in order to create a realistically-achievable schedule?\n\nEvery project gets done by steps.  If we want to maximize our success, we need to choose HOW to be successful every day.  I unwittingly let **emotional prioritization** run my life for *most* of my life, simply because I didn't know HOW to do better!!",

          "text": "Most procrastination is not laziness. It is avoidance. You are not delaying the task. You are delaying the feeling the task creates. Usually that feeling is boredom, uncertainty, fear of doing it badly, or pressure to do it perfectly. So the first shift is to stop making it a character flaw. It is emotional management. What helped me was shrinking the entry point aggressively. Not “I will finish this project.” Just “I will open the document.” Not “I will work out for an hour.” Just “I will put my shoes on.” The goal is not productivity at first. The goal is breaking the resistance barrier. Once you start, momentum does more work than motivation ever will.\n\nAnother thing is removing the negotiation. When you sit there thinking “should I start now or later” you already lost energy. Decide a time in advance. At 4 pm I start. No debate. Even if you feel off. Even if you feel uninspired. You are training yourself to act before you feel ready. That is a muscle. Also pay attention to your environment. If your phone is next to you, if ten tabs are open, if your bed is visible, you are making it harder than it needs to be. Friction works both ways. Add friction to distractions. Remove friction from the task. Keep the document open. Keep the book on the desk. Make starting stupidly easy.\n\nAnd be honest about perfectionism. A lot of procrastination is secretly “if I cannot do it well I would rather not do it.” Give yourself permission to do it badly. A messy first draft beats a perfect idea in your head every time.\nFinally stop waiting to feel motivated. Motivation usually comes after action not before. Start small. Stay consistent. Forgive slip ups quickly. The goal is not to become a productivity machine. The goal is to become someone who moves even when it is uncomfortable. That is it.",

I take a mental note that this means I need to sit down and further think it through. Most of the time, if I break the thing down into smaller chunks that are actionable, my initial thoughts about it are no longer present and I can get moving forward on it.",

However, it's not just out of laziness. Every second I put it off, I'm feeling guilty and anxious. But I just can't bring myself to do it. There's a mental hurdle I can't crack. I try to-do lists, which help me at work to not forget things. But actually getting to things is the hard part. I don't think I get a sense of accomplishment from things. I just feel a brief relief from knowing I won't get in trouble for not doing it anymore. But that feeling is fleeting, and I quickly move onto the next thing to stress about. I think the lack of dopamine and all the distractions and quick dopamine-seeking behaviors are partially to blame. We're not comfortable with boredom or stillness, so we distract ourselves. But it's usually in those moments of boredom and stillness that we find a solution to our problems. Or actually decide to do something about them. Some people with ADHD use accountability partners to get things done.",

I think very similarly to you about things, especially the 'mental hurdle' just being impossible to consistently get past. It's interesting that you relate not finishing tasks to negative reinforcement, mainly with the deadlines as you said; I tend to think more positively in that aspect that if i DO finish a task, I'll get something in return either in the moment, or being a step closer to achieving something. \n\nSo then I'm back to square one with how do I get myself to DO that task, even if there isn't a reward. Making it more of a habit to just say yes to stuff, or build the want to do things now so that it is done and out the way.\n\nAccountability partners are great, and for the majority of day-to-day tasks that's the push you need to get chores done. When that partner isn't involved in a project you're working on, or has no background in the reality of what goes into that 'thing' you do, it makes it harder to feel motivating, and sometimes can feel more like a chore itself because someones telling you to do it, but doesn't understand it which makes it feel more like a 'boss' or 'parent' demand you know?\n\nAnyway - thank you for letting me know how you experience this, as our situations sound very similar but from slightly different angles. I hope you find something that works for you :)\n\n",

Those things are optimized to perfection to make you hooked. On every video, tell yourself \"this is not real\", \"this was made to grab my attention\", \"this is stealing my time from doing X\".\n\n\nYou need to make it perfectly clear to yourself the implications of your actions. Don't berate yourself, but just let yourself be bummed out by the poor quality of what you are watching. Be honest with your remarks. Eventually you will get the hint and Instagram will look like the cesspool that it is. \n\n\nAnd have something else to do instead. The void in your schedule is a seductive bitch.

They do a year end wrap up and last year I met with people in 64 different countries. \n\nPeople use it for all types of things. You can mark people as favorites, so I’ve made friends on there. Like a Nigerian man living in London working on his PHD. He is 16 years younger than me (almost to the day). An unlikely friend who I adore. \n\nSometimes I just schedule one to stay off my phone.

I in my life have not \"forgotten\" where I as a person want to be in the short- and long-run once I knew what those were. I don't need a post-it or a Notion document to remind me about what I want, it's ingrained and part of my person.\n\nThe other major thing I ejected were the copious \"good ideas\" that you come back to if there's time or after this next more important thing. That was a hard one to let go of because who wants to throw away a good idea? But realistically, if it's not such a good idea that it's changing your strategy and priorities, and it's just a \"maybe later\", then it's just never going to happen.
