Then I tried doing it first thing in the morning but id just dread waking up.\n\nNow I do like 20 to 30 min of the boring crap right before jumping into my main project and something about getting that friction out of the way puts me in this weird flow state.

And as it turns out... it's not unusual that a lot of small tasks never ***needed*** to be done at all in the end.\n\nObviously there's exceptions, like booking flights and stuff where doing at the last minute can go wrong.

I just vacuumed i might as well mop i havent mopped in months... and on and on. I could do BS tasks forever. They will literally never end.  \n  \nI've been struggling trying to train myself out of that mindset. Like Self talk:\"the big task\" really isnt a big task dude, it's BS too, it doesnt need to be perfectly planned and 100% effort, 80% effort will be the same as 100% and will take 1/5th the time. Just fckin get a done so u can do the next thing.\" It's like an addiction to stress chemicals and avoidance .",

I do have ADHD, so I open links with intentions to look at them and then once they're out of sight, I forget about them and move on to opening new tabs. When I do go back and look at them, I'm afraid that I'll need the info in the future and will lose the info if I close it. Others are things I started researching and got distracted and never finished, but I keep it open cause I want to finish it and I pretend I will. I'm working with my therapist on a lot of this stuff cause it is related to my ADHD but you gotta figure out what's holding you back from closing stuff",

I know this is a couple of days old but I came to say I was JUST like you with the million tabs and I have been 'cured' for a few years now!   \n  \nFor me, the fix came when I realised I was overstimulated and my life was super cluttered. I had to admit to myself that I never went back to any of these tabs (hence why they stayed open forever), and trust that if I needed to go back to that website, I'd find it again via google or search history.   \n  \nI think I was overloading my mind with too much stuff that's unrealistic to do/read/achieve and I just had to admit that it wasn't plausible. 99% of times when I close a tab I never go back there again and forget what it even was - cos it wasn't even that important to me in the first place. \n\nI guess I'm just saying - you probably don't need all of those tabs. Go through and do a mass delete of your bookmarks - it might feel icky but you'll realise you never even went back to them/you'd be surprised some of the random stuff that's there you don't even care about. Once you realise that, it'll be easier to just close a tab and let go. \n\nNot sure if this really helps, I guess I just wanted to let you know it's possible to rid yourself of this affliction :D",

A lot of tasks aren’t hard, they just carry a tiny emotional charge, like uncertainty, self judgment, or the fear of doing it wrong. Research and planning feel productive because they let you stay in control without touching that discomfort. What helped me was shrinking tasks until they had almost no emotional weight, like opening the email draft without sending it, or writing one rough sentence. Once the task stops feeling like a verdict on you, action gets easier. I’d be careful about trying to numb the feelings away, because the signal is useful. The real shift for me was learning to act alongside the discomfort instead of waiting for it to disappear.",

For example, instead of writing one rough sentence, I would only focus my awareness on writing a single letter at a time. But that takes a lot of practice to do well. And it can be done even better than that. If you get good enough, you just take each moment as it arrives.

Shrink your tasks until it feels almost stupid not to start. When motivation is gone, stop asking yourself to “finish” anything. The goal is just to begin. I like to set a single Pomodoro (I use pomofocus.io) and tell myself I’m only working until the timer ends. Don't think about anything beyond that first cycle.\n2. Use habit contracts. One of the biggest takeaways from Atomic Habits is that habits stick when the cost of failure is immediate. You HAVE to pre-commit to a consequence before your future self tries to negotiate their way out of doing the thing. Habit contracts will be your best friend. I use Line (try-line.app) because I like having it on my computer, but I know there are also other mobile apps that do the same.\n3. Lower the bar for your success. A huge reason people quit is all-or-nothing thinking. Just because you miss one day or go halfway to your goal doesn't mean it's all over now. Consistency is better than intensity when it comes to long-term productivity, motivation, and discipline. Do something today that you'll thank yourself for tomorrow.\n\nYou got this!",

It’s a trap because researching feels like progress, but it’s just a sophisticated way of avoiding the discomfort of starting.\n\nYou mentioned your emotions tell you to delay tasks. That happens because when a task list is vague or overloaded, your brain perceives it as a threat.\n\nWhat finally clicked for me was a radical shift to **extreme simplicity** based on the **80/20 Principle**.\n\nWe often forget that **80% of our results come from only 20% of our actions.** Most of the stuff on our \"infinite to-do lists\" is just noise that makes us anxious. Here is my framework now:\n\n1. **The Rule of 5:** I pick exactly 5 high-impact tasks per day. These are my \"20%\". If I have 20 things to do, I force myself to pick the 5 that actually move the needle.\n2. **Binary thinking:** I either \"Win\" the day (5/5) or I don't. It stops the emotional negotiation. When the target is that small, your brain stops panicking.\n3. **Visual Statistics:** I started tracking my \"Win streaks\" (Days -> Weeks -> Months). Seeing real data on when I’m actually winning vs. just being \"busy\" changed everything. It turns productivity into a game you don't want to lose.\n\nStop researching supplements and start shrinking your list until it's impossible to fail. That email you’re procrastinating on is probably one of those \"20%\" tasks—just do that, and you've already won most of your day.",

Clean my inbox. Reformat notes. Rename files. Make a to-do list so detailed it feels like progress. And at the end of the day, the actual task that mattered is still untouched.\n\nFor a long time I let myself believe this counted as productivity. At least I wasn’t *wasting time*, right? I was being busy. I was doing things. Everything looked cleaner and more organized, so it felt justified.\n\nBut it finally clicked that busy and effective are not the same thing.\n\nI noticed it one evening while I was playing jackpot city on my PC and taking a break between sessions. I realized I’d spent the entire day “preparing” to work, and none of that preparation had actually moved anything forward. I had just made avoidance look respectable.\n\nThe hard part is that productive procrastination feels good. It gives you the dopamine of motion without the discomfort of focus. There’s no risk, no resistance, no chance of failing at the real task. Just activity.\n\nOnce I started calling it what it is, it became harder to hide from myself. Now when I catch myself reorganizing instead of doing the thing I said mattered, I stop and ask whether this actually moves the needle or just makes me feel better.\n\nI still clean and organize. That stuff has its place. But I’m trying to be honest about when I’m doing it because it needs to be done, and when I’m doing it to avoid the work that actually counts.\n\nIt’s been uncomfortable, but also clarifying. Less pretending. More intention.",

      "text": "For some context, I have a technical background and am pursuing my masters degree in Germany. I recently read about some amazing stuff you can do with a gyroscope sensor on your dominant hand to log your daily life without actively having to log every hour.\n\nFor the last 20 days I wore this \"make-shift\" device that logs my working habits, (for now it only recognizes writing, typing, Idle / scrolling phone and taking sips from a cup).\n\nThe discoveries I made about myself are more weird than interesting. It's amusing how many small details we miss while self reporting/ reflecting on our day.\n\nI tracked around 105 hours of desk activity over a span of 20 days.\n\n**Most interesting discoveries :**\n\n* Around 30% of all my time spent on desk was scrolling my phone. ( Idk how much of it was doom scrolling and how much of it was something useful)\n* I drank around 35 cups (mostly coffee) and ironically, my phone usage spikes while drinking it and stays high for 30 minutes after. ( So much for being my focus coffee !)\n* Out of all the time I spent on desk it was only 30% of total time that was spend on Writing and Typing combined.\n* Considering all Idle time ( no phone scrolling) as focused reading / trying to understand something on the screen, I spent about 40% of total time in focused work.\n* None of my continuous focus blocks last more than 30-40 mins (43 mins being the highest).\n* I get distracted by my phone roughly every 30 mins, on better focus days / exam pressure days, this only improves sightly to around 50ish mins. Average distraction duration is about 10-15 mins ( Swings between 2 mins to 20 mins )\n\n  \n**On Productive Days** ( My post-day assessment 8 days )\n\nTime spent on desk : 4-6 hours / day\n\n* 30% (Typing + Writing) + 50% Idle (Reading hopefully) + 20% (Using phone).\n* I drink less coffee while working during a productive day in most cases 1 or none.\n* My focus duration doesn't improve, I still get distracted every 30 mins or so but each of these distract sessions last less than 5 mins.\n* Somehow my most productive sessions start between 10 am to 11:30 am and as I end these sessions around 3 - 4 ish ( The sun goes down here in winters and so is my willingness to work)\n* 90% of my productive hours have been during the day.\n\n**On Non- Productive days** ( My post-day assessment 12 days)\n\nTime spent on desk : 3-5 hours / day\n\n* 20% (Typing + Writing) + 30% Reading + 50% (Using phone).\n* Around 2-3 coffee's per day.\n* My average focus duration is around 15 mins.\n* All these days I had morning classes hence I tried starting a session around 5:30 pm to 6 pm and mostly it never worked out. Only 1/8 productive day started in the evening hour.\n\n**Weekly Trends :** \n\n* I seem to operate on an alternating cycle. My 'battery' can sustain a maximum of two good days in a row then I almost always have a non productive day.\n* I work best on the edges of the weekend, riding the new-week high on Monday and the pre-weekend sprint on Friday\n\nThese insights into my daily routine have been honestly fascinating to watch unfold. I’m currently looking for deeper patterns, trying to figure out if I can reverse-engineer my habits to 'hack' my brain into better consistency and bridge the gap between my productive and non-productive days. I just wanted to share these early observations. What’s interesting to know would be if anyone else with a similar lifestyle finds themselves navigating these same specific productivity cycles?",

Working less can get you more done. Grinding works until it doesn't.\n2. Raising prices increases sales. Counterintuitive but the logic is: high price = high trust for valuable services. Cheap signals low value.\n3. Being hyper-specific gets broader reach. He uses this archery analogy - aiming for the bullseye hits more of the target than vaguely aiming at the whole thing.\n4. Internal distractions beat external ones 5:1. 80% of focus problems are your brain avoiding discomfort (boredom, anxiety) not your phone. Which means app blockers solve 20% of the problem.\n5. Jobs aren't secure. This one's uncomfortable. Single income source = high risk. Golden handcuffs are real.\n6. Failure is part of success, not opposite of it. Business is asymmetrical - many attempts for one win. Nobody wants to hear this but the data shows it repeatedly.\n7. Creating teaches more than consuming. The creation-to-consumption ratio matters. Building something beats reading another book about building.\n\nTheme frequency across 50 videos:\n\n* Financial freedom: 20 videos\n* Goals: 15 videos\n* Entrepreneurship: 14 videos\n* Productivity: 12 videos\n* Mindset: 10 videos\n\nGuy's core obsession is wealth building and escaping 9-5. Everything else supports that.\n\nMost repeated tactical advice:\n\n* 90 day goals work better than annual ones\n* Write goals somewhere you'll see them\n* Learn high-income skills (sales, marketing, AI)\n* Start before ready, clarity comes from doing\n* Solve expensive problems for people with money\n\nAnyone applied the \"work less\" principle or tried 90 days goals?\n\nEdit: Methodology was scraping transcripts and comments with TaffySearch, then AI for data analysis",

Like many creators he's made enough videos to get across what he actually thinks, but he's got to keep on producing content so you end up just getting so much fluff and nonsense. Don't take him seriously, he just makes content for people who think they're doing something by watching an hour of youtube self help and writing down half a page of roughly scribbled notes. \n\nI do think James Scholz suffers from a similar problem but not to the same degree, the guy just posts about cool looking retro tech and it seems all very consumerist and perfomative nowadays. I like the vibe of the videos sure, but I really wouldn't say he has a minimalist mindset, nor is he giving any actionable advice like Cal, he's a comfort watch, I wouldn't take actual advice from him.",

I don’t worry about streaks or paying for features, I just open my notes app and write.\n\nFor someone who struggles with habits, the key for me was lowering the friction so much that it felt easier to do it than skip it. Maybe tweaking whatever tool you pick to be as simple as possible would help you actually keep it going.",

Also, when I can’t visualise information I also spend time trying to visualise it for me to finally get it into my brain. \n\nHowever, this takes away a huge amount of time, I genuinely feel unproductive after just sitting and analysing a new topic. I can’t be like my other classmates who don’t care about details and they just go over the topic in one sit. That’s why I never have time to cover all the material quickly especially in preparation for exams and tests. But If I don’t analyse it, I will not understand it and will be confused. What do I do to increase the speed of my studies and maybe adjust my study routine ?",

This subject is completely new to me and introduced some advanced concepts that I had little to no background in. \n\nThe strategy that I found (which I haven't properly tested yet), was to shut off my brain for a moment, organize the material into sections (if they're not already), and consume the content per section. If I encounter unfamiliar terms, I'd assume that the author will give clarity to them later on in the text. To make sure I don't forget the term, I write it down in a piece of paper that contains all the terms that I will come back to later after reading the whole material. (Yes, I'd still read the whole material even if it doesn't make sense at the moment.) \n\nIf the term still wasn't made clear by the material, I will then look for YouTube videos that discusses the concept, try to create examples of my own (if viable), or just ask my professor for clarification (if viable).",

Why are you studying? \nAnd then if you can, figure out a way you can quiz yourself. This allows you recall what you know so you can fill in the gaps. Think of it like a tree. What’s the main trunk, then the big branches. I divide the time I have by the big branches and work down to the smaller things I need to know. \n\nFor example Currently I’m studying for a pilates exam. (If you don’t know pilates, think of it like a gym). What does the person need to know? Where to go. That’s the equipment they are on, that is the tree, the first thing is the what. Then they need to know which way to use the equipment. Then they need to know how to move, and then why they are moving. \n\nBreaking things down into these simple parts before even opening a book is essential, so you have structure to put your learning onto. Think of it like heading and subheadings.\nThen look at how much time you have to learn these things.  Take your headings and divide the amount of time you have by the heading. Eg, one hour, 6 headings = 10 minutes per heading. Give yourself this time, and learn the smaller parts, but give them the same structure, under the heading, (branches) are the smaller headings (twigs) and then the leaves. \nYour brain will have way more structure, learn it easier, and know why you are learning this. \n\nAs you work through, give yourself short breaks and try to remember things, it’s ok if you don’t remember everything, allocate yourself time to recall every day, what you had learned the day before. Use the tree analogy. It’s ok if you don’t get right down to the microbiota. \nAlso what helps immensely if you can find them is past tests, they will show you the direction in which you need to go. \n\nGood luck! You got this.",

I'm not sure if you are just getting focused on a word and an hour is going by or if you literally need an hour to understand these words, but it sounds like you might be neurodivergent and a mental health professional might be able to help you. \n\nFor now, though, one hour is too long to do a deep dive into a word or phrase. I would either set a timer for like 10-15 minutes or write a running list of topics you want to do a deep dive into that you do after you've read the work or you could maybe put a note next to the concept or word with what you think it might be and come back to it to confirm later. Something else that might work is reading the material quickly once and then going over it again with your current study processes. It may also help you to try this method of just going over it quickly multiple times. I know that sounds weird and this isn't a long term strategy, but some artists will do this with a painting to help them figure out certain things about their style, the painting, and their processes. This might help you figure out why you're having so much trouble just reading it through the first time. Everybody gets caught up on a word here and there, though, there's nothing to feel bad about regarding that.",

          "text": "You are distractible, because you unwittingly trained yourself to be. Spending hours every day on the smartphone or computer is practicing distraction. And digital stuff is designed to be addictive, to increase profits, and it's ruined the attention span of an entire generation of people. It's dopamine overstimulation; and makes everything else boring by comparison.\n\nOne gains focus the same way one gains distractability; by practicing it. Meditation, focusing on the breath, is one way to practice focus; you focus on the breath, mind starts drifting away, you catch yourself starting to distract yourself, then ignore the distraction, and return to the breath, over and over and over again. The more one practices this, the more one's ability to focus and stay focused on the breath improves.\n\nSame with homework. Notice your attention starting to drift, catch yourself drifting, redirect your mind back to your homework, again and again and again. Hard, even painful, at first, gets easier over time.\n\nCreating a distraction-free environment helps, too. So does putting obstacles in the way of doing distracting things. If you take a break, use a timer to alert you when break time is over. Reminder apps help too, in reminding you it's time to do a certain task. When doing homework, turn off the internet entirely, preferably unplug it, so that turning it back on requires getting up, walking over, plugging it back in. This helps \"wake you up\" out of the subconscious habit of scrolling.\n\nAmerican Hindu monk Dandapani has a great TED talk on [\"Unwavering Focus\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2JK_94g3Y). Worth the watch. He had the same problem with focusing, once.",

I know that seems silly, but if you don’t believe in your work, you’ll do anything to not get it done. Social media, and Reddit, isn’t a bad thing to be on, there’s a lot of good community in here if you know where to look. But set a timer when you get on your computer, say 30 minutes?

I would sit down with a single, almost boring task like read two pages or write three rough sentences, then stop and reset.

Maybe if you don’t do anything that’s fun or entertaining in your free time, and Reddit is the only thing that spikes your dopamine, that’s why you do it. I think your mindset about this is wrong, because your parents are telling you it’s bad, and you are constantly telling yourself it is, and you feel awfull. But I see you as a person who is responsible and smart, so it’s probably your way of rewarding yourself or relaxing. I think you should just set a timer for how long you scroll on Reddit, and try to not do it every time you take a break. Let’s say you study today, then you scroll Reddit one time, then you study again and after this bout of studying you do promodoro and just stare at something uninteresting for 5 minutes. And every time change the order of the breaks, one time the first break is the promodoro, and then Reddit and so on. Make it random so your brain doesn’t know when a dopamine spike is going to come, and help with it not being dependable on it. \n\nI hope this helps.",

It really helped me understand my natural rhythms and peak productivity times, which made my tasks much more efficient once I knew when to do the deep work versus the administrative stuff.

It does many things that R does, but in the python syntax so more transferable skills.\n\nStart with the fundamentals. CS50 is a free course that teaches that. Not in R, but that doesn't matter at this point. After that jump back into R. Do all the problem sets again, but in R. Use a LLM to help you with the syntax.\n\nI don't know your background or goals, but if you want to do stats or machine learning, I recommend you do a separate course on linear algebra and calculus. If you only do straightforward analyses and data visualisation, you can skip this.\n\nWhile you're familiarising yourself with the maths, you can start working on problem sets that use the data that ship with R. These are all over the internet. It's vital to understand how R stores and interacts with data (dataframes, vectors (confusing name because it's not a vector)) and how to access and changes values (indeces etc).\n\nAfter that, I'd jump straight into a project you have. It will be messy, but you'll get through it understanding a bunch more. After that, it's just iterating as fast as possible building a portfolio of projects.",

First couple team meetings tho it got weirdly awkward. People kept glancing at them even tho I wasnt recording anything. You could just feel that \"wait is he recording us?\" vibe. After 3-4 meetings I stopped bringing them cause it was affecting the actual conversations.\n\nTried those recording pen things too but honestly carrying another device that needs charging felt like it defeated the purpose. I already wear glasses everyday so something that just replaces those made the most sense to me.\n\nEventually switched to audio-only smart glasses for meetings without cameras. Found some called dymesty that have a titanium frame which feels pretty solid, kinda reminds me of my old lindberg frames. They just look like regular glasses which is exactly what I needed.\n\nThe transcription spits out meeting summaries and action items which actually saves me a ton of time going back thru notes later. Battery lasts a few days so its pretty low maintainence.\n\nObvious tradeoff is no video capture which would be useful sometimes for whiteboard sessions or demos. But honestly having people act natural in meetings matters way more for actually getting work done.\n\nWhat tools have actually stuck for you guys? Voice recorders? Note taking apps? Im curious what ended up being genuinley useful vs just creating more friction in your workflow.",

My experience IRL: a meeting usually has anywhere zero-two pages worth of actual noteworthy info to record. \n\nI started years back with recording everything in handwriting, which is fast-ish and extremely flexible (sometimes a few sketchy arrows or some weird shaped squiggle can save a few lines of text). All that served was a memory aid, which I’d then turn into real, distilled meeting notes. Some info became tasks, some became appointments, some became emails, very small amounts became long-term info to (catalogue in a super easily findable, effortless system) keep long term. \n\nIf i waited a few hours, the paper-to-final would lose quality. 2-3 days later, was still a “pass”, but longer would usually mean my original notes are about half as useful. \n\nThe “trick” is … experience. Which allows you to half-process in real time what’s going to end up becoming a task, calendar, eml, data, etc. and either create those in real time, or jot down the essence of what those would contain. \n\nAlso, helps to make it imperative (by gently and timely bringing convo back on track when it slips off) for group to reach decisions or declare actions (with owner <- VITAL VITAL VITAL, a due date (or date for status update, by whom, to whom), and these derived actions need be super **clear** actions, which are a no brainer to know whether they were indeed done or neglected …and done/neglected by whom). \n\nWhen a decision/action cant be reached, group must either consciously decide the idea is not going to happen, or (if further info is required to decide), a decision when this item is due for discussion/resolution. I know that’s not exactly about note taking, but it is critical: a. To reduce useless meeting time and useless notes that do nothing IRL and b. a focused meeting leads to clarity what is going to become a task/appointment/email/another meeting/etc.\n\n**Tldr: dont just record every utterance made; rather keep asking “so what?”, and not the answer to that. Capture meaningful info, not raw data.**\n\nThese days, i just write an email to myself during the meeting, subject is “meeting with x about y”.  I try to understanding what needs to be done if at all about everything being said and just create tasks and cal appointments on the fly, even write short emails if those are the desired outcome of any exchange of words (eg if we’re talking about considering an equipment purchase, I’ll just email the vendor to request a quote for the equipment, takes < 1-2 min). **Only what cant easily be done on the fly** becomes a bullet point (hopefully) or a short paragraph (if all else fails; with key words bolded). End of meeting, email sent. These email-notes-to-self usually end up anywhere zero to 10 bullets.\n\nI get back to office. Asap: turn what’s left in that email to self into tasks/cal/immediate action/schedule follow up meetings/etc.",

Like many others, an audio recording has worked well for me in the past and I've always asked, \"Is it ok if I record\" and always get a yes though as others have said this isn't appropriate in every situation. One problem is that I'm essentially setting myself up to sit through the meeting twice (at 2x speed but still..) I've come to realize that I'm faster and more accurate typing my notes than I am writing them so I always try to do that whenever possible and have the format preset so that I have a place within my document to put to-dos and decisions in real time. If I have to write I have shorthand things like putting boxes around the to-dos/decisions (always with due dates) if they end up not in a list for some reason.Your role in the notetaking makes a difference too -am I taking notes while also running the meeting? That makes it a little easier to steer the conversation towards the exact topics and info that I'm looking for. Other times there's brainstorming and meandering before arriving at a decision (some of which is relevant to include and some not) so I do feel myself basically transcribing a meeting sometimes before the it becomes clearer which parts are important. I try to be prepared to highlight to-dos quickly so I can format them more clearly after the meeting and use strikethroughs, or greying out, something I can do fast that tells me that this part is outdated or less important and I can quickly polish the notes afterward (with or without the recording). By no means a perfect system, but the main thing I've learned is I do not rely on having a clear remembrance of the convo, as I've caught myself being wrong too many times. So, I try to clean the notes asap and definitely the same day.",

I’ve seen the same thing with cameras, bots announcing they’re transcribing, or people typing nonstop — it pulls everyone out of the room.\n\nWhat’s actually stuck for me is keeping it boring and invisible. Either audio-only capture (with clear consent once, not every meeting), or very light manual notes focused only on decisions + next actions. I don’t try to capture everything anymore. If a tool makes me manage batteries, devices, or awkward social dynamics, it’s a net loss, no matter how “smart” it is.\n\nThe big tradeoff you mentioned is real. Video is nice for whiteboards, but natural conversation beats perfect records every time. Anything that reduces friction during the meeting usually ends up saving more time after the meeting.

I can pay for apps if needed.\n\nI’m going to school and do lot of other things, So I need a full productivity system that covers everything. Here’s what I’m looking for:\n\t\n• Task management: An app to manage all my homework and tasks, with priorities, rescheduling, and full versatility, A daily planner that keeps me on track because I often forget assignments until the day before.\n\n• Note-taking: The best app to take school notes efficiently.\n\n• Study & focus: Apps to improve focus while studying, e.g., Pomodoro technique or similar tools.\n\n• Habits: Apps or methods to track and build good daily habits.\n\n• Apple ecosystem settings: Any automation, shortcuts, or settings to make all devices work seamlessly together for maximum productivity.\n\nWhat apps, setups, or habits do you recommend for someone using a full Apple ecosystem who wants to maximize productivity?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Switching tasks is actually detrimental to productivity to the point that it is better to literally sit and do nothing if you need to wait a couple of minutes.\n\nPomodoro works great for a couple of reasons. It forces breaking down tasks and mandates breaks.

I am going to start looking for a job next week & my goal is to find something by end of Feb. I felt like I finally had everything going for me & I was so motivated to get my life on track. Now I feel like that someone pulled the rug beneath me. Please give me some motivation & advice. I can't give up now. I have people telling me ro move to another city in Canada & even Dubai to make money. I have always wanted to start my own online business or freelance. I feel like I am frozen & I have no clue what to do. I am good to work till 70. I just want to be financially stable.
