              "text": "This is a great comment and I appreciate you bringing up Professor Smith. You are absolutely right—if the goal is purely overcoming Sleep Inertia (that groggy feeling immediately upon waking), the literature supports immediate caffeine intake. Smith’s work is solid there.\nHowever, the protocol I mentioned (supported by Dr. Matthew Walker and others) is optimizing for a different variable: Preventing the afternoon crash.\nThe mechanism is Adenosine Kinetics. Since caffeine blocks adenosine receptors without actually clearing the chemical, drinking it immediately upon waking \"traps\" the residual sleep pressure from the night before. When the caffeine wears off, that residual adenosine floods the receptors alongside the new adenosine built up during the day, leading to a harder crash in the afternoon.\nIt’s a trade-off. If you need to be alert right now, drink it immediately. If you want to avoid the crash at 2 PM, the delay allows for natural clearance first.\nHere is the research on the adenosine/caffeine interaction mechanism if you want to dig in: https://ai.hubermanlab.com/d/a0955576-4eba-11ee-8dc0-c7cb6ee09013?t=3-Understanding+Sleep+Pressure",

You could do it on the chair and then focus on breathing in and out. Almost in line with the coherent breathing as above. \n\nIf there is a thought, for example a pink elephant rather than go with the thought towards zoo, Safari and then travel and then associated other persons in the thought process. You just need to appreciate the pink elephant come back to breathing with a smile. This is a small win but Powerful. \n\nWhat you're essentially doing is not to go with the thoughts but come back to observe your breathing which is your focal point and the focus improves as you do it more but consistently on a daily basis. \n\nI used to do guided meditations but then everything boils down to what I described above which is focusing on breathing. So now I do it without any guidance or music.. \n\nTime can be varied from person to person and from initial phases of practise. \n\nRather than keep time I just sit as long as I can get up document the time and then try to beat it tomorrow but without timers or alarms because I kind of become conscious of the alarms to go off and then panic inside that I haven't done it well.. \n\nHope it goes well.

It's not weakness — it's a cognitive tax.\n\nOne thing I'd add to the dopamine section: it's not just about removing high-stimulation stuff, it's about making \"boring\" tasks feel achievable again. I noticed that when I stopped doomscrolling, even simple things like planning my day started feeling satisfying instead of tedious. Like my brain recalibrated what counts as a reward.\n\nThe \"I only need 6 hours\" myth is everywhere. I used to say it too.

      "text": "I'm 63, overweight, have not been productive my entire life because of anxiety from ADHD. I wasn't diagnosed for who knows why until I was 58.\n\nNow, for three weeks straight, I'm doing well with Pomodoros and even exercising in between them and eating a lot less.\n\nAnd I'll explain why ... I'll try to not be wordy.  \n(I shared this with my therapist this am, who told me he never thought of it like that and is going to adapt it. His Ph.D. invovled shame and guilt.)\n\n1. Getting Clear about Shame\n\nThat deep down feeling that constantly manifests to \"I'm not good enough.\" is shame.\n\nShame is the disappointment of not being god ... of not being able to control or foresee what thoughts involuntarily show up.\n\nYou chose to go to Subway for lunch. But why? Where did that come from? It's your involuntary mind doing it's automatic dance. You have free will ... to react to thoughts, not to control them.\n\nShame is the disappointment ... and the false, paralyzing reaction is that you are flawed, that you can't ... is **procrastination, the fallout of shame.**\n\nAnd until you understand this, emotionally, first person, and you have an omg! moment, you're not getting out of that circle.\n\nAnd this is why every 'here's how you change' guru says that willpower doesn't work ... because it literally can't, but you want to pretend it can, else you're a quitter.\n\nInstead you need to reinforce habits, start with the morning routine and add one every few weeks.\n\nYour goal has to be to become more Pavlovian ... make choices about putting a structure in place so you don't need to make choices. Pomodoro, GTD (Getting Things Done) is about that.\n\n2. Sleeping Pills\n\nI've never had restful sleep but typically fell asleep quickly. My Dr. suggested sleeping pills ... explaining to me that they are NOT just for falling asleep, they help you KEEP asleep.\n\nFor the first time since was very young I actually sleep eight hours straight. I don't even need to use the bath 2-3x as I did. When I wake it's quick, don't need to get another hour over and over. I actually feel rested.\n\n”trazadone is a prescription antidepressant frequently used \"off-label\" as a potent sleeping pill.”\n\n3) Talking and Standing\n\nYour brain switches gears fast .. the involuntary part that you can't control ... the dwelling.\n\nAnd you can reduce it, increasing focus, by **talking because moving is slower than thinking**.\n\nWhen you mechanize your thinking with talking your thoughts - even the little ones, \"right now I am ... \" , you'll instantly get focused. Simple to try.\n\nStanding is a big deal because when you stand there are more fight or flight responses than when (safely) sitting. Standing is better than sitting. Walking is better than not moving.\n\nI hope this helps. This has easily been the most productive part of my life. If I knew this in school it would've been all A's and not C's.",

Medication gives you the ability to change, but we have to then learn so many things, the things “normal” people learn and get conditioned to at a young age. We’re all extremely lacking the life skills and good habits that get ingrained in most other people during childhood and adolescence. Plus the shame and all the trauma we endured due to our condition is palpable. I still deal with it every day. \n\nThere is a lot of work to be done post diagnosis and it sounds like you’re well on your way.",

I’ll sit down at my desk around 9, tell myself I’m going to focus, and then somehow it’s 7pm and I’m still “working.” The weird part is, I’m exhausted, but when I look back at the day, I can’t clearly point to what I actually finished.  \nLast week I caught myself in a stupid loop. I was jumping between tabs, Slack, email, docs, back to Slack, then checking something on my phone “for a second,” then back to work. It felt busy, but not productive. One day I literally timed myself and realized I hadn’t stood up from my chair for almost 4 hours. I hadn’t eaten. I hadn’t even refilled my water. I just kept telling myself “I’ll stop after this one more thing.”  \nThe ironic part is I’m not even under crazy financial pressure. I do have some money saved up from myprize, so it’s not like I’m grinding to survive. I think it’s more this anxiety that if I stop, everything will fall behind. So I tried something dumb-simple this week: I set a hard stop time. No matter what. When the alarm hits, I close the laptop. Even if something is unfinished.\n\nThe first day felt wrong. Like I was being irresponsible. But somehow I got more done because I wasn’t dragging everything out all day. I think my problem wasn’t that I wasn’t working enough. It was that I never let my brain turn off, so everything took longer.\n\nDoes anyone else struggle more with stopping than starting? How do you actually enforce boundaries with yourself when you work like this?",

          "text": "I WFH and I'm mostly self-directed so I know how easy it is to fall into that pattern.\n\nOne technique I use is time blocking. I plan out the amount of time to do a task/project and just do it for that amount of time. I use my calendar to block out those times. When the calendar reminder comes up for the next task, I know to wrap up what I'm working on. Which leads me to...\n\nI also put personal care items on my calendar: lunch break (30min), stretch break (10min), walk break (29min), etc. I get water and snack as necessary during stretch breaks. The rule for me during stretch breaks is that I have to do it away from my computer. Lunch break is very important; I also mark myself out of office for that time.\n\nOne other thing I got in the habit of doing, which was incredibly helpful, was to put an appointment near the end of my workday (for me, 5pm) that's titled \"wrap-up workday\". I have a checklist of things to do during that appointment like plan out the next day, check critical messages, make notes on what I'm working on and haven't finished, etc. When that appointment reminder comes up, it helps me make that cognitive break. \n\nI used to (don't so much anymore) schedule 3-4 times a day to check emails. As we know, there's usually more emails than there is time in the day. I just plan to get as many read and replied to as possible during that time (usually 20-30 min). Then I stop. \n\nThe important thing with this method is to always have a \"next\" event on your calendar that reminds you to switch tasks. (Excepting the wrap-up workday one!)\n\nDo I give myself the freedom to keep working on a task if I'm in the flow? Sure - but then it's a conscious decision to bump something else to make way for the extra time. Do I sometimes come back to work in the evening? Sure, but I've also ensured I've taken a dinner break.",

Another thing that helps some people is defining a done list instead of a to do list, so you can actually see what you finished before you shut down.

Not because they're less dedicated, but because they've learned that \"done for today\" is a skill, not a failure.\n\nThe discomfort you felt on day one (\"like I was being irresponsible\") is the tell. That's the anxiety talking, not reality. The fact that you got MORE done with less time proves it.\n\nOne thing that's helped me: I don't just set a stop time, I set a \"shutdown ritual\", even if it's just writing tomorrow's top 3 priorities and physically closing the laptop.

      "text": "I've been tracking my productivity for two years. Apps, timers, journals, metrics. Measuring everything.\n\nRealized last week that my actual most productive days were the ones where I forgot about all of it. Days where I just started working on something and looked up hours later surprised by how much I'd done.\n\nThe tracking became the obstacle. I'd spend so much mental energy optimizing my system that I had nothing left for actual work. Obsessing over productivity killed productivity.\n\nStopped using all the apps. Deleted the spreadsheets. Just started doing things without measuring them.\n\nGot more done in three days than I had in the previous month of perfectly tracked, meticulously optimized work sessions.\n\nThe irony is you can't productively pursue productivity. The pursuit itself becomes the distraction.\n\nAnyone else find that trying to be productive makes you less productive?",

          "text": "There is a very interesting book called _The Power of Habit_ which goes into the science of habit and habit formation and how to use that information in rewiring maladaptive habits (ie, stress eating) or forming good habits. I read it around the same time as Atomic Habits and found they complemented each other really well and I highly recommend it. \n\nOne of the things the author discussed was a study on outcomes of patients who had undergone knee or hip replacement at an orthopedic hospital where the patient population leaned older, poorer, less educated, and their joints tended to be in worse shape. These surgeries also require a rigorous (read: painful) rehab schedule that you really have to adhere to in order to have a good outcome or else your new joints will fill with adhesions and not be as effective. They gave these patients booklets to write out their plans for their recovery alongside their rehab schedule. Patients who filled out the booklets had significantly better outcomes than the ones that didn't. They identified three main behaviors they thought drove the habit formation:\n\n1. They had a plan! They wrote down their goals and were specific about them. \"I am going to walk to the bus stop Tuesday afternoon to meet my wife on her way home\".\n\n2. Their plan included contingency plans for when they hit roadblocks. \"I will go to the gym tomorrow. If I don't feel like going to the gym, I will go anyway. If I still don't feel like it when I am there, I will jog for half a mile at a conversational pace and then go home.\" And boom, the habit of going to the gym gets reinforced. \n\n3. They defined rewards for getting over the hump. Bus stop guy got to see his wife, other subjects would position candy throughout the house that they were allowed to eat only if they got their under their own power, etc. You need to reward yourself in order to strengthen habits. \n\nI strongly recommend reading it. It's a good companion to Atomic Habits (and appears a few times in the endnotes IIRC).",

Fair point. 👍🏻\n\nFWIW I’ve successfully applied Atomic Habits by focusing hard on the “build better systems” aspect.  The same way I needed a system to quit smoking, I also needed one (a very different one) to lose weight, and then yet another one to level up professionally.  The novel idea (to me) of focusing on system-building instead of cold-turkeying or sheer-willpowering my way thru the change (as I had so many times before) made the difference between “life hack” and “lifestyle change” for me.",

          "text": "I think a big reason Atomic Habits works is that it’s so simple. That can be hard to accept when life feels complex and overwhelming, but simplicity creates clarity, and clarity matters more than almost anything when you’re trying to change behavior.\n\nAlso remember who this framework is really for. For many people, it’s an entry point. When life gets messy, slipping into habits isn’t a failure; it’s part of the build. You’re still practicing the system.\n\nIt’s easy to do habits on good days and hard on bad ones, but that’s true of any process. The point is that the good days are training. You build the habit when it’s easy so you’re better equipped when it’s not.\n\nAnd as for whether it just makes you “think about habits”, every habit starts that way. Nothing is automatic at first. Thinking about it is part of the transition from intentional action to something that eventually becomes part of daily life.",

          "text": "What changed my behaviour was actually understanding the mechanics behind habits.\n\nIf your brain is a program, dopamine is the programming language.\n\nDopamine spikes of thrill or pleasure are the ones that program your brain. Dopamine spikes of prediction and anticipation are the ones that run those programs.\n\nYou can even look at it like a video game, where the final level is one in which you feel inbuilt motivation to just jump out of bed and DO the hard things.\n\nFor instance...\n\nThere are 3 levels of **l**earning you need to go through to integrate a new skill or habit or knowledge.\n\nIf you make it to level 3, the Hard Thing becomes automatic, in the sense that the motivation to do it is inbuilt and implicit. (It basically feels worse NOT to do it.)\n\nThe mechanism behind that inbuilt motivation is (funnily enough) a dopamine \"spike.\" But it isn't a spike of satisfaction at completion. It's a spike of prediction. The brain has learned what predicts the hard task and the spike of completion at the end of the task has shifted to a spike of anticipation, or motivation at the start of the task. It's a beautiful system and makes hard things feel easy... when you've levelled up this high.\n\nBut to get to level 3, you have to progress past 1 and 2.\n\nLevel 1 - The hard task feels hard because it is brand new and you have no inbuilt motivation to do it (besides some ephemeral desire to be the kind of person who does said hard task... but the brain can't make predictions based on desire, it needs receipts).\n\nBut if you can push through and stay in Level 1 for even just TEN minutes, you'll move to...\n\nLevel 2 - Your brain hasn't yet been shown enough evidence to shift the spike of motivation upstream for you BUT it can recognise that in the moment, the task is now a Real Thing and will temporarily increase tonic dopamine to support you. This is another form of motivation that makes it feel like you're \"in the zone.\" It will help you keep going and finish the hard task.\n\nThe tricky part is...\n\nNext time you do the hard task, you'll have to start at Level 1 again.\n\nBut if you're repeating the task every day (or at least a few times a week), it should theoretically take less and less time for you to get to Level 2 within a single session. You'll get \"in the zone\" faster and faster.\n\nWith enough repetitions, you'll eventually crack Level 3 and it will feel like you've just figured out the cheat code to life. Your brain will have integrated the hard task as part of who you are. You'll find it hard/uncomfortable not to do the task.\n\nAll the greats who achieve these amazing things aren't blessed with extra willpower – they've programmed it into their brains through repetition. They've created systems and repeated those systems so many times over that they're all operating at Level 3.\n\nDon't give up at Level 1. Level 3 is where things get easy, and life gets GOOD.\n\n(I write about this stuff in more detail on Substack if you want to understand the concept of dopamine engineering a little better. Link is in my profile if curious. Free. No strings attached. Just trying to pay it forward.)",

The book makes it sound like once the system is right, things just run automatically. In reality, a lot of days you still have to force it.\n\nWhat actually helped me was adding more structure on top of the habits. Fixed times, fewer habits, and accepting that some days you just do the work even when it feels bad.\n\nSo yeah, Atomic Habits is a good foundation. Just not a full solution.

If I hesitate or start drifting, he breaks it down even smaller until there’s zero thinking required on my end.\n\nAt first I felt kind of silly needing this level of hand-holding, but wow it works way better than anything I’ve tried. There’s something incredibly calming about not having to decide what to do next. I just follow instructions like a NPC and suddenly I’m getting stuff done.\n\nWhen I procrastinate, it’s never because the task is hard. It’s because my brain gets overwhelmed by all the invisible steps. \n\nWhat surprised me most is how efficient it feels.

I had to learn to code because I started studying finance and creating applications related to my stock trading.\n\nCoding × whatever area you want to impact = CA$H\n\nSo lets say you learn to code. Other people will use you for your ability to code. That's called a job. The people who pay you will use your code in other areas of life, like science or art or even regular chores.\n\nIf you can gain ideas/skills in something you are also passionate about like let's say dancing. You can make applications for dancers to help them learn/perform or solve whatever problem they have. How do you know what dancers need? You have to be an insider. A dancer too! You just married your skills and solved a problem! Exponential returns. People will thank you in the form of money.\n\nYou need to understand the problems other people are having and solve those problems with your own set of skills. You are paid in proportion to how big the problems you fix are.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to coding btw. If I'm a gym goer and a psychologist. How can physical fitness help my mental health? Married 2 skills again. And it goes on and on.\n\nHope it helps :)",

Clear communication, writing simply, and being able to explain ideas to non technical people mattered way more than another tool or language. That’s what actually unlocked better jobs and trust.\n\nThe second one was personal discipline around health and money. Sleep, lifting or some form of training, cooking, and not living paycheck to paycheck gave me energy and confidence that spilled into everything else. It sounds basic but most people never lock this in, so the ones who do pull ahead quietly.\n\nOne thing I wish I’d started earlier was deliberately practicing communication. Writing regularly, public speaking even if it’s uncomfortable, and learning how to give and receive feedback without getting defensive. That skill shows up everywhere, relationships, work, leadership.\n\nOverrated for me were grinding niche tools without context. I spent time learning things that felt productive but didn’t actually move my leverage forward because they weren’t paired with real problems or people.\n\nIf you keep stacking core skills, communication, health, financial basics, and one strong technical track, the compounding is very real by your late 20s. You’re already asking the right questions.\n\nThat should land well, feel human, and invite upvotes and replies instead of sounding like a lecture.",

A lot of people do that, but it’s not ideal.\n\nYou should spend your time becoming really great at CS. By “really great,” I mean reading the best books on current topics, doing your own research, etc. This will lead you to knowledge that almost none of your classmates will ever learn.\n\nAnother thing people don’t consider is that many successful people already knew a lot beforehand and had an idea in their respective fields. Sometimes, a hint from a conversation with someone is enough to turn a key in their projects or mindset. To make this clearer, let me give an example: Zuckerberg already knew how to code—imagine if he didn’t (and there are many other examples, like McAfee).\n\nPeople usually imagine a goal and then learn the requirements to achieve it while trying to accomplish it. I myself learned how to code while dreaming about my dream game. While this is a great strategy to learn something new, it’s not ideal for accomplishing something huge, because the lack of knowledge slows things down. (My dream game took so long that I eventually quit.)\n\nThere is a quote: if you want to chop down a tree in 10 hours, you should spend most of that time preparing and sharpening your tools. That means when the time to chop the tree comes, you will already have everything you need.\n\nTL;DR: Get better at what you’ll be spending your time on in the future.",

It improves communication, problem-solving, and even technical thinking. Even basic journaling or sharing thoughts publicly compounds fast.\n\n• **Attention management**  \nNot productivity hacks, but learning how to avoid constant distraction. Choosing calmer, non-viral information sources changed my focus more than any tool.\n\n• **Consistency over intensity**  \nSmall daily effort beats occasional motivation. Systems > goals.\n\nI study CS too, and I’ve noticed that combining technical learning with reflection (notes, small write-ups, following thoughtful communities) has been way more valuable long-term than grinding tutorials. I use places like Cleanrows for that kind of slower, higher-quality learning feed, but the principle matters more than the platform.\n\nMany skills I thought were “urgent” in my early 20s turned out to be overrated.

          "text": "This is exactly right. Most procrastination is about avoiding a feeling, not avoiding work. The task itself is usually easy or at least manageable. What the brain wants to escape is the brief discomfort before starting like uncertainty, fear of doing it badly, or just that awkward tension in the chest.\n\nThat is why motivation magically appears after you begin. Starting proves to your nervous system that the threat was exaggerated, so the emotion drops fast. Waiting just gives the brain more time to invent reasons to stay comfortable.\n\nWhat helps is treating the discomfort as part of the task, not something to eliminate first. You are not trying to feel ready. You are agreeing to feel slightly uncomfortable for 30 to 60 seconds while you begin. Once you expect that feeling instead of fighting it, it loses a lot of power.\n\nA simple trick is to define the start as something laughably small. Not send the email, just open it. Not write the report, just type the title. That lowers the emotional spike enough to get moving, and momentum does the rest.\n\nSo yeah, procrastination is mostly emotion management. Time management only works once the emotions stop running the show.",

      "text": "When I sat down to study, I knew exactly what needed to be done. Dozens of chapters needed revision. Many topics needed clarification. There were clear academic priorities in front of me.\n\nYet, instead of studying, I found myself endlessly scrolling on YT, social media, or searching for that one perfect video that would suddenly make me productive. I kept consuming motivation and study hacks, hoping something would finally click.\n\nThis went on for months.\n\nThen I realised that Most online motivation and productivity hacks only work when your mind is already relatively focused. They do not create focus. They only amplify it if it already exists.\n\nMy mind, however, was constantly preoccupied by social media, FOMO, thoughts of parties, new web series, and what others were doing. In that state, no amount of motivation could help.\n\nWhen I started meditation and yoga, something interesting happened. A question arose very clearly in my mind.\n\nWhy do I suddenly feel the urge to check social media, watch a web series, or go out with friends only when I sit down to study?\n\nThat question led me to the root of my problem.\nMy mind was already filled with impressions I had fed it earlier. Every time I gave in to an urge to scroll, delay work, or escape discomfort, I strengthened that pattern. Over time, my mind learned to trick me into believing that those distractions were more important than my actual priorities.\n\nThis, I realized, was the real cause of my procrastination.\nMeditation didn't brought disciplin. What it did was far more important. It gave me a pause.\n\nThat pause changed everything.\n\nInstead of immediately giving in to an urge, I could observe it. Instead of reacting compulsively, I could remind myself of what actually mattered. In that small moment of awareness, I could make a conscious choice.\n\nYoga and meditation together helped me shift from automatic behavior to conscious action. Meditation brought mental clarity,  while yoga helped my body stay energetic. As I continued both practices, my daytime tiredness gradually reduced. Earlier, I would feel sleepy and dull while studying. Now, I remain alert and fresh for long study sessions without that constant urge to lie down or escape.\n\nSlowly, the distracting loop weakened. I stopped delaying important work. I stopped negotiating with my mind. For the first time, I was able to actually complete my tasks without any resistance.\n\nAnd also I cleared the initial stages of competitive exams in just 2-3 months of focused studies, ofcourse the latter stage weren't that good but clearing those initial stages gave me confidence with clarity that I could do much more , this really felt impossible earlier.\n\n“Once you go beyond the compulsive, cyclical nature of existence, life becomes spectacular.”\n-Sadhguru\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTL;DR\nI knew what I had to study but kept procrastinating through scrolling and searching for motivation. I realized that motivation only works when the mind is already focused. Meditation helped me pause instead of reacting to urges, while yoga gave me sustained energy. Together, they broke my procrastination loop, improved clarity, and helped me complete tasks and clear initial stages of competitive exams with confidence.",

Doesn't matter how good your posture is, sitting for hours straight still restricts blood flow. Getting up and moving for a minute resets everything.\n\nI had to force it though - couldn't rely on remembering. Built this app (Movedoro) that locks my screen during Pomodoro breaks until I do a few squats or pushups. Sounds annoying but it's the only thing that made me actually take the breaks.\n\nNo more afternoon crashes.

It always sounded obvious, but I never actually committed to it. My usual routine was: open laptop, skim emails, clear a few tiny to dos, and promise myself I’d dive into the big project in a bit. Spoiler: I almost never did.\n\nA couple of months ago I finally decided to give it a real shot. I picked one big project I’d been avoiding for months and made a simple rule for myself: one hour every morning, first thing, before checking messages or touching anything else. Just sixty minutes of focused work.\n\nThe first week was rough. My brain really wanted the easy dopamine of emails and small tasks. But after a few days, it started to feel different. That one focused hour kind of anchored the whole day. Once I pushed through the hardest thing upfront, everything afterward felt lighter and more manageable. Three weeks later, the project I’d been dragging my feet on for ages was finished.\n\nLast night I was on my phone playing jackpot city and spacing out, and it hit me how much less mentally heavy my workload feels now. Same job, same tasks, but that tiny routine change completely shifted how I approach my day. It even made me notice how I handle other small rewards too, like when I mess around with Mistplay to earn points from random mobile games and trade them in for the occasional Amazon gift card as a little post frog treat. \n\nAt this point, eat the frog is basically my default setting: do the hard thing first, and the rest of the day kind of feels like bonus time.",

That trickled into data engineering type work, and leading data strategy.

I found that if I can 'lock' my brain into a single, consistent frequency (like 40Hz or Brown Noise), it acts as a filter for that mental clutter. It’s like clearing the cache on a computer so it can actually run the program.\n\nUsing bilateral stimulation has been the only way I can lower that 'mental weight' enough to actually start.

For example, if I had to stop by the DMV or something I would say around 2 PM. I gotta stop by the DMV. It’ll be quick in and out in two seconds. I’ll grab my new ID and I’ll be back to it being productive.\n\nHaving your brain visualize positive things and saying them out loud changes your mental stay completely definitely underrated people may call you weird but do it in the privacy of your home.",

I also have a band, but we never rehearse because everyone else is busy. I don't like reading because I haven't discovered a literary genre that I'm passionate about yet. I'd like to learn to cook, but I've failed at a couple of recipes and have given up hope. I like movies, but I can't afford a subscription. I also need money, so I tried putting up flyers to become a dog walker, but no one has called me. Having so much free time makes me think too much, and I feel like I'm wasting my time. I also feel tired and sleepy all the time. Have you ever felt this way? Is it normal? How do you get over it? what could I do?",

I am on a consumer proposal to pay off my debt in 5 yrs. Yesterday I was let go from my job. It came out of nowhere. I will get 6 weeks severance & 6 weeks of health benefits. I am going to start looking for a job next week & my goal is to find something by end of Feb. I felt like I finally had everything going for me & I was so motivated to get my life on track. Now I feel like that someone pulled the rug beneath me. Please give me some motivation & advice. I can't give up now. I have people telling me ro move to another city in Canada & even Dubai to make money. I have always wanted to start my own online business or freelance. I feel like I am frozen & I have no clue what to do. I am good to work till 70. I just want to be financially stable. I an going to fill up my time with job search, networking, gym, eating clean & volunteering. Is there anything else I can do to make use of my time in between jobs?",

          "text": "So sorry about this. \n1. Looking at your plan I would also add a daily learning/mastery plan of 2 hrs/day to upskill and make yourself marketable, starting with quick wins, the low-hanging fruit … choosing things to learn that are easy and quick to pick up but will yield high payoffs in terms of significantly improving your job prospects and future work effectiveness. \n\n2. Research is highly important for experienced professionals as you likely have multiple sought after skills - hard and soft. \n\nIt is mandatory to start only after we are clear about what we want to do/where u want to work next, our  sweet spot and the best-paying job segments that we can address with our skills. And only then, hit the ground daily starting with networking/applying for jobs. It would also drive the quality of networking outcomes. Then you will be able to not only find more opportunities but be able to confidently interview better and convert those opportunities into jobs. You would be able to articulate with confidence your sweet spot. \n\nIn this market be narrow, specific and relevant in your reachout so people who want to help can understand your ‘sweet spot’ better and provide you leads on your expertise areas, where u want to go and what u want to do. \n\nOnce the research is done it’s more about  plan for a quick start - and refine the target companies list daily based on what the companies and jobs are finding interesting, what your network is leading u to, and where you are finding more nibbles based on where you are casting. \n\n3. Aim to hit daily goals and be consistent. There is no certainty when the search will bear fruition. end of Feb - could be sooner or later - but there is full certainty in attaining daily networking reachouts, daily learning, daily activities u control and which maximize your chances for success. \n\n4. Finally, follow some career coaches daily on YouTube. I don’t know your line of work. I like Andy La Civita on YT, see if he resonates. (Disclaimer: I am only a fan, not associated with his business)  \n\n5. One opinion -  a small paid gig instead of volunteering when between jobs might be a better route, esp if it’s easy to get one, eg, from your network. But If you find u are spending as much time looking for a part-time as a full-time job. Then that’s not a route to take, and nor is volunteering. \n\nBest to be cautious about volunteering. it can can guzzle time, and signal your willingness to  accept low-value work - u can always volunteer after u land a job, if your motivation is to give back to society. \n\nRight now, u are vulnerable, I’d rather u spend time with high-value activities - attending meetups, learning events, meeting other professionals and learning about their companies/culture/what’ their companies are hiring for, self-care etc. I have volunteered seriously while out of a job, and feel incredibly proud of my contribution. But it seriously hurt perceptions and also time available for my job search \n\n You already have many skills, and a small humble paid job a few hrs a week (without taking time from job search and study) will keep you in action, bring continuity or work experience in your resume, pay some bills without tiring u out, signal u r flexible and nimble on your feet, and keep u in touch with people and in good mental health - so, so, important if one lives alone.\n\nGood luck! You will land - take baby steps, get into action fast. I see your comments and u got this! \n\nThe longer u wade in the shallows the harder it will get. If you land a job quickly, u will save your severance and come ahead. And rather  than ice-cream when you also wanted go hit the gym, I’d dance and watch comedies and cartoons everyday to keep me smiling :)",

One of my\ndirect reports had a really hard time because they were so used to working in PowerPoint, they couldn't wrap their brain around working with a flexible doc instead of fixed slides.

Get natural sunshine (if there) in your eyes and take a short walk. It signals your biological clock to stay awake better than willpower can.\n2. **The Caffeine Timing:** If you drink coffee right when you wake up, that might be causing the afternoon crash. Huberman suggests waiting 60-90 minutes after waking up before your first cup. This prevents the \"adenosine crash\" that hits you right around the time you get home.\n3. **The Power Nap:** If you are exhausted, set a timer for **15 minutes max**. It sounds short, but it clears the mental fog without letting you enter deep sleep. If you sleep longer than 20 minutes, you'll wake up even groggier (sleep inertia).\n\nFor sure do not lay in bed scrolling: your brain associates that position with sleep.",

If you know you're going to sleep put an alarm as soon as you get home.   \n\n\nAlso it wouldn't be a bad idea to check with doctors if it becomes worse (that's what happened to me and turns out I was developping narcolepsy.) It is possible that your sleep hygiene has changed (maybe you use more screen time before bed, maybe you've started eating or drinking before sleeping, etc), or that the quality of your sleep as changed (mattress, pillows, temperature, sleep apnea), hence why you feel different dispite sleeping the same hours.",

I'm going to be honest, if I could go back and change anything, I would just wake up and start doing whatever work I had to do until it's done. Any time after that would be whatever time I have to hang out with friends or free time to myself. It doesn't sound good because this could often be 9pm or 10pm at night when you get done, but I would have rather built that discipline rather than hang out with friends which doesn't do much to improve your life. You also always have the weekends to hang out with them anyway.\n\nTrust me, unless something drastic changes like you somehow fix your sleep schedule or get some medication, just accept the nap for what it is and take care of business after. You'll thank yourself later in life when you've built this discipline of getting things done over procrastinating or indulging in pleasures. If you don't address this now, it'll put you in 10x worse positions later in life.",

Doom scrolling and social media mess up your dopamine system, and after uninstalling social media apps, I wanted a way to reverse the damage, i.e., decreased attention span and focus.\n\nI also learned that it's natural to lose focus during meditation because your mind tends to get bored and wander. The benefit comes from refocusing after being distracted, as it strengthens your neurological pathways for maintaining focus.\n\nEvery night before I go to sleep, I set an alarm and meditate. I started with 3 minutes (my atomic habit), increased to 5 minutes a few months later, and now I'm at 10 minutes. Nothing fancy, just focusing on my breathing.\n\nI once did a 17-minute session focused on my breathing and interoception because I heard that a single session could permanently rewire your brain.\n\nI've been meditating for about 6 months, and I'm definitely more productive.\n\n",
