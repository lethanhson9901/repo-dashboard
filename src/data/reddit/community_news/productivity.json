      "text": "neuro student here and honestly... i’m kind of embarrassed to even type this out considering what i actually study. like i spend my entire day in the lab staring at dopamine pathways and reward circuits under a microscope, and then i’d literally get home and just waste away for 4 hours straight. just staring at absolute garbage on social media until my eyes actually burned.\n\ni used to tell myself i just lacked discipline or whatever but it’s not even a moral failing. my brain was just conditioned to need that constant hit of novelty to the point where sitting in silence felt physically painful. tried all that \"productivity guru\" crap and none of it worked for me. here’s the only stuff that actually stopped me from wanting to throw my phone into a lake:\n\n1. the paper list. i had to stop using notes apps because they’re a trap because they’re on the phone. now i just use a shitty notebook and write down 4 things: someone to text, a chapter to read, a drink like tea, and one 50 min task. that’s it.\n\n2. the \"human\" buffer. if i actually talk to a real person after lab, the urge to scroll drops by like 90%. i think it just kills that \"stimulus hunger.\"\n\n3. the \"off\" switch. this is the big one. i turn my phone completely OFF before i even walk in the door. not silent. OFF. the 30 seconds it takes to reboot is usually enough friction to kill the impulse when i’m brushing my teeth and my brain goes \"check the feed.\"\n\n4. the \"win\" task. i just do one 50 min thing like studying or cleaning. ending the day with a finished task feels \"heavy\" in a good way, way better than the high of a 15 second short video.\n\n5. closing loops. i just dump everything stressing me out onto paper and then write one tiny, stupid step for tomorrow. not \"fix my life,\" just \"email the lab tech.\" it stops the brain loops so i can actually sleep.\n\nlook i still fuck up. some nights i’m just dead and i rot on the couch anyway. but my nights feel like mine again. i stopped trying to use willpower because mine is gone by 9pm and i just made it harder to use the phone.\n\ntldr; your brain isn't broken, your environment just sucks. make it harder to use your phone and stop being a degenerate.",

Phone isnt a routine, its a distraction. \n\nI personally roll out of bed, and do push ups/weights/stretches every morning to get blood pumping as I get ready, heave breakfast etc. To get here I started small and got myself a few succulents pot plants, so every morning I roll out of bed, open the curtains and water them, then make my bed. These few small things helped me to get used to get up first thing after waking up, and get going. Now I have some what of a routine, where I do excercise shower, eat and check phone, and leave home. There isnt enough time in the day as is, and the best thing to help me avoid brain rot is to follow that usual advice: Get tough tasks out of the way, which means getting my blood puming. Its not for everyone, but it works, where as phone is just prime the brain for media consumption and no thinking which sets up the so so day.",

Then in the morning, the first thing I do is make my bed. Then I drink water and go stretch because my body was frozen in place for 7-8 hours. Then I meditate for five minutes, followed by writing a journal entry of what I want to do that day. Meditation is a must. If you can't be in silence with your own thoughts for 5 minutes, then how can you do anything? Then if time permits, I go on a 5k jog. That's the start of my day.\n\n\nWhen work starts, I try to do the most difficult task first. That way, everything else following will be easier.

Crossword puzzles always seem like too much pressure when I’m trying to ease into my morning or wind down at bedtime, but word searches feel so chill and casual to me, but you can still choose level of difficulty to keep brain stimulation up. I have a book of cozy, meditative word searches, and I have another book that is random facts like words associated with an event or historical moment, so if it seems intriguing then I do a deep dive into the history too, kind of keeps my brain stimulated or craving more. Having more than one type of word search allows me to choose based on my mood or goal of what I want to get out of it. Also, most typical wordsearch books are not super enticing. Like even if you get to a puzzle themed “Travel”, it’s words about a business trip, CEO, brief case, etc. So, I intentionally sought out cozy word search books instead of just a random airport gift shop one, though they are still fine in a pinch!!! \n\nIdeally I prefer paper books to get away from phone distractions, but sometimes phone apps are nice if you’re in a waiting room or on the bus,  or sometimes just because you’d rather play on your phone, etc. \n\nI also play mahjong in a phone app!

Caffeine (tea and coffee)\n2. Songs (i face earworms ) and Movies\n3. Reels and Shorts (i never used insta but i used to watch yt shorts...)\n4. Quora (sometimes vulgar content u know and violent content u know )\n5. P#rn and M#asturbation\n6. Movies\n\n**what helped me in this journey so far :**\n\n1. **leaving tea and coffee completely** : First, it helped me in calming my nervous system so I can rest better, sleep better, and nap better. Secondly, I have a little bit of constipation, so it helped me in constipation also.\n2. **leaving songs, reels / shorts**: I experience earworms, where songs I listen to keep repeating in my mind. I stopped listening to music for a while, and it helped me sleep better and think more clearly. The earworms were contributing to my brain fog, and by reducing them, I was able to significantly lessen that brain fog.\n3. **leaving movies** : I used to fantasize about it after watching it, and instead of resting it, it makes me fantasize more and increase my brain focus, so I think it is better to reduce it.\n4. **leaving quora** : Just a lot of vulgar content\n\n**and my routine is like :**\n\nI wake up at 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning and do all the rest of the stuff, and at night I follow the 11:00-6:00 routine, like I close all the devices till 10:30 and sleep till 11 p.m. last. Actually, I am a college student so I I have no time to make a schedule between this time.\n\n**EDIT : A lot of people are asking where I get stimulation from. ?**\n\n* I get my stimulation from various podcasts and lectures, and I read a lot on different topics like narcissism and astrology and different topics.\n* In addition to that, I didn't put any limitations on my food; I do eat fast food 😋😋 except caffeine. I didn't put limitations on various kinds of food and love eating different kinds of food, especially sweet things. even before the dopamine detox !!\n* I socialize more than before, and I know if I lowered the dopamine to an extreme, then it will cause motivation issues, work issues, and sleeping issues, because I have done dopamine detox after reading some famous books on dopamine.\n\n**And talking about the benefits i got :**\n\n1. Better energy whole day\n2. clear mind and weird type of sense of satisfaction and happiness in the mind\n3. feeling a bit lonely after 1.5 week mark is done may be still withdrawls are going on\n4. My nervous system is now calm down, so I can have better rest, better sleeps, better naps.\n5. I can think better, in terms of calculation-wise, and now I am present in the moment while talking.\n\n**Final conclusion :**\n\nnot going to follow these whole my life, except the songs and caffeine part, but will do it every few months, like every three months, 15 days of Dopamine Detox or something like that. That will reboot my system and recharge my body.",

The system collapses.\n\nI realized something: I never clearly defined what a “successful day” actually meant.\n\nWas it:  \n– 8+ productive hours?  \n– Completing every planned task?  \n– Zero distractions?  \n– Hitting streak numbers?\n\nIt was vague. So missing one thing felt like total failure.\n\nRecently I tried a different approach:\n\nInstead of optimizing everything, I defined a **minimum viable day**.\n\nEach day must include:\n\n– 1 physical action (movement, even small)  \n– 1 mental action (reading, studying, skill-building)  \n– 1 forward action (something that directly moves a long-term project)\n\nIf I complete those three, the day counts as a win.\n\nAnything extra is bonus.\n\nWhat changed is psychological:\n\nOn busy or chaotic days, instead of giving up, I focus on hitting the minimum.  \nOn high-energy days, I exceed it naturally.\n\nI’m about 2 weeks into trying this and my consistency is higher than with any complex system I’ve used before.\n\nCurious:\n\nDo any of you define a “minimum threshold” for a productive day?\n\nOr do you aim for full optimization daily?\n\nI’m trying to build something sustainable instead of intense but short-lived bursts.\n\nWould love to hear how others structure this.",

But when I define a floor instead of a ceiling, it creates momentum instead of guilt.\n\nYour three categories make sense because they touch body, mind, and direction. I’ve been experimenting with a simple rule too: one thing that maintains, one thing that improves, one thing that builds. It keeps the day grounded without turning it into a checklist marathon.\n\nCurious how you chose those three buckets. Did they evolve over time or did you just intuitively know what mattered most?",

I have a whole morning routine. I journal, I review my task list, I plan my day. I felt really good about it honestly. Like I was doing everything right\n\nexcept I kept ending the day having done almost none of the actual important stuff. And I couldn't figure out why because I was \"being productive\" for like 10+ hours\n\nIt finally hit me last week when my girlfriend watched me work for a bit and was like \"you know you've been rearranging that same list for 20 minutes right\"\n\nand I got defensive about it obviously. But then I actually paid attention the next day and she was right. I spend SO much time organizing my tasks, color coding things, moving stuff between apps, tweaking my system. I moved from Todoist to Notion to Obsidian to just Apple Notes back to Notion in the span of maybe 4 months? Each time I'd spend like a full weekend migrating everything and \"setting up my system\" and feeling super accomplished about it\n\nI wasn't doing work. I was doing the performance of work. The planning and organizing felt like productivity because it involves effort and screens and typing but none of it was actually moving anything forward\n\nThe thing that made it click was I tried something stupid simple. I wrote 3 things on a post it note on monday morning. Just 3 things I needed to finish that day. No app, no color coding, no priority matrix. and I finished all 3 by like 2pm. I literally had never done that before. Not once in the past year of my elaborate productivity system\n\nI'm not saying apps are bad or whatever. I just think I personally was using the organization as a way to avoid the actual hard tasks. because organizing feels productive and safe but the real work is uncomfortable and I might fail at it or something idk\n\nhas anyone else dealt with this? I feel like I can't be the only one who fell into this trap",

The 20 minutes rearranging a list IS the problem. Not the tool, not the system - the fiddling.\n\nWhat clicked for me was separating two totally different types of tasks. Stuff that needs doing today? That's your post-it note, 3 things max, no app needed - you already proved this works. But then there's recurring maintenance stuff (cleaning, bills, groceries, admin) which needs tracking somewhere but should NEVER appear on your daily priority list. It's a totally different cognitive category.\n\nThe second category is what pulls people back into system-building. \"I need to remember to do X every 2 weeks\" -> \"I'll set up a system for that\" -> 3 hours later you've redesigned your entire Notion workspace.\n\nI ended up building a dead-simple app just for the recurring stuff (N-day - developer disclosure) specifically because I needed something I could NOT fiddle with. There's literally nothing to customize. You add a task, set the interval, tap done. No templates, no views, no color coding, no migration weekends.\n\nBut honestly the post-it note insight is the real win. The tool for the recurring stuff is secondary.

I noticed the same thing — I could spend hours refining systems, but the moment I actually started the first uncomfortable task, everything became easier.\n\nWhat helped me most was treating focus like training. Instead of optimizing the system, I optimized starting. Once you complete the first “rep,” the resistance drops massively. The danger is that organizing feels productive, but starting is what actually builds momentum.\n\nI even built a phone application for this ",

Because it takes a lot of effort to track tasks, organize, etc.\n\nI use Obsidian to track my monthly goals with a checklist. The goals are made at the start of the month or end of the last month. The goals are usually the same: learn 2 recipes, read 2 books, workout X times, etc. I update the checklist like once a week when needed.\n\nI don’t use any apps to track recurring tasks, because I already have a routine so I don’t spend time creating daily tasks and crossing them out. For example, on Saturday, I’m productive from 9am - 12pm. I already know to start with 30 minutes of reading - I don’t need to make a task for that. I already know then afterwards I might be learning Japanese or coding on my iOS apps until 12pm. I don’t need to make tasks for that because I have a routine.\n\nWhat I do make tasks for, is if it’s something that will take weeks to complete, which I use Microsoft To Do. So for example, learning Japanese. I’ll have tasks there like: Lesson 1, Lesson 1 course book questions, and Lesson 1 workbook questions. Etc. But I don’t make daily tasks like “Work on Lesson 1 notes”, “Continue working on lesson 1 questions” since I already know since I have a routine. Same for my iOS apps: Fix Bug X, Add Feature Y. But I don’t need daily tasks.\n\nFinally, I use Apple’s Reminders app for non-productive reasons: recurring home maintenance, grocery list, etc. Reminders app is for personal stuff, To Do is for productivity stuff. Obsidian is for monthly goal tracking.",

          "text": "Are you a diagnosed or undiagnosed person with ADHD by any chance? It sounds like you're finding things that interest you more than work. That the organisation system thing is giving you your dopamine hit more than completion of your planned tasks. Further evidence is the way you keep changing the organisational system or tool. It seems very ADHD-like to me. \n\nOf course you don't need to have ADHD to be doing this dopamine hit thing from your planning. It is probably quite common. The key thing is that you've realised it's a problem. That means to can affect a change. \n\nMy advice is to leave apps and programs alone as much as possible. Remove them if you can.\n\nI would suggest going analogue in a simple way. A diary (UK meaning as a planning tool not a journal of what you did) with appointment times and space for notes.\n\nDon't substitute digital planning tools for analogue ones where you're doing too much analogue planning in the same way as your digital planning.\n\nTime block your day with meetings, meeting prep times and other work tasks assigned time to work on. I don't think you need to say that the task X must be done in 2 hours from 14:30 to 16:30 without fail. Just that is the time allocated to progress it forwards. Don't rush to finish just do those two hours of work and progress on that task. Finish before if you're at a good place in it to stop.\n\nBasically I say that you're spending 5 minutes every day reviewing the last day and getting the current day blocked out with fixed work task times. That you're sticking to those times and not planning instead. The thing is you're doing not planning. You spend very little time planning as that's your procrastination weakness. So simply put do very little of it. Change the time to more productive work instead. Sounds easy and it is but may take some time to develop into the better work habit. \n\nBTW your analogue post it note success of a day shows that keeping the planning stage as simple as possible, hence my advice about analogue only, is the right way forward for you.\n\nI would even go as far as saying you allocate time at the end of the working day to planning for the next day. That way the natural tendency of people to be looking forward to finishing work plays to your advantage. You allocate your last 5 minutes to planning means you'll stick to it or miss your train home if working in an office. Or your WFH day goes on longer than you want. It kind of associates over planning with a negative of having to be at work longer than you should or longer than you get paid for.",

What finally broke me out of it was realizing there are two separate problems that people keep conflating.\n\n**Problem 1:** What do I need to do today? Your post-it note. 3 items max. You nailed this.\n\n**Problem 2:** What recurring stuff needs tracking over time? Bills, maintenance, weekly reviews. This is where people get sucked back into system-building, because they try to solve BOTH with one elaborate tool.\n\nI tested a bunch of things for problem 2:\n\n- Todoist: Good for recurring tasks but the UI tempts you into overcomplicating with labels, filters, priorities\n- Notion: Powerful but dangerous for us. Too customizable. You spend more time building than using\n- Apple Reminders: Actually underrated for simple recurring stuff. Set and forget\n- Plain calendar events: Works surprisingly well for things like 'check smoke detectors' every 6 months\n\nThe key was keeping these systems completely separate. Daily priorities stay analog. Recurring tracking goes somewhere you cannot fiddle with. The moment you merge them into one system you are back in the optimization loop.",

Every time you color-code, rearrange, or migrate to a new app, your brain registers real cognitive effort and rewards you for it. That's why it feels productive. You're spending genuine mental energy. Just not on anything that moves forward.\n\nThe post-it works for the exact opposite reason. Three items, no categories, no system to tweak. Your brain has nothing left to organize so the only remaining option is doing the thing.\n\nThe part that stings: real work usually involves decisions with uncertain outcomes (this paragraph might be bad, this client might push back). Organizing has zero risk. So your brain picks the safe decisions every time unless you take them off the table entirely.",

Cool advice, tried all of it, like bought planners, downloaded time tracking apps, even tried that stupid time blocking thing. Nothing worked cuz the problem was never about time \n\nHere's what I realized -> I had plenty of time. I just didn't want to admit how I was spending it like when I actually tracked one full week of what I was doing hour by hour, it was embarrassing (really embarrassing believe me)\n\nWhat you really saying when u say \"I don't have time\" is -> this thing is not important enough for me to do. And that's fine honestly but at least be honest about it\n\nWhat actually changed for me -> I stopped saying I don't have enough time and started saying \"it's not a priority”. \n\nTry it for one week. Instead of \"I don't have time to work out\" say \"working out is not a priority for me”. \n\nSounds different…\n\nCuz once you hear yourself say \"my health is not a priority\" something clicks and you either actually do it or accept you don't care. Both better than lying to yourself every day.\n\nI went from \"I have no time for anything\" to studying,  learning new skills, reading daily, and working out, same 24 hours. \n\nI just stopped bullshitting myself about where they were going",

Showered and thought about it. Lay awake and thought about it. More circles.\n\nDay eleven I went for a walk because I needed to leave my apartment. Headphones were dead. Didn't look for the cable.\n\nSomewhere around minute 35, not thinking about the decision at all - I was actually thinking about why the proportions on a building I was passing looked slightly wrong - the answer arrived. Clean. Obvious. Like it had been ready for a while.\n\nI've read the neuroscience since. Default mode network, diffuse attention, walking and cognition. All of it confirms what that walk demonstrated privately: the brain solves things in the background when you stop foregrounding them, and unstructured movement without audio input is one of the most reliable ways to let it do that.\n\nThe problem is it produces nothing you can log. The walk looks like a walk. The output shows up later in the work, unattributed. So nobody builds it into their system.\n\nI now protect one hour a week with no input and no output. Phone exists but stays in my pocket. No podcast, no planning, nothing to produce. Started thinking of it as infrastructure for the work rather than a break from it.\n\nThe ROI showed up in the eleven-day problem and that was enough evidence for me.",

Then one afternoon I went for a walk with no phone and no podcast, just silence. About twenty minutes in, the whole structure just appeared. I was not even thinking about it consciously.\n\nI think our brains need that downtime to process things in the background. When we are actively trying to solve something, we can become too zoomed in. Walking, showering, or driving somewhere familiar seems to let a more diffuse mode of thinking kick in and connect dots we could not see up close.\n\nWhat you are describing is real, and it happens more than people give it credit for. I have started treating walks as part of my actual work, not a break from it. It is a different frame, but it changes everything.",

I know that to reach that point, I need to put in the work. I am okay with putting in the work, and want to improve myself. But my brain *literally* refuses to listen to me. I have to negotiate with it 24/7 to even convince myself to do the work. This leaves me exhausted when I have to do the actual work that I end up half-assing it. Why does this happen?\n\nWhy can my brain not understand where I want to go? It does 2 things. It either negotiates with me, saying that we can do it in 5 min, etc. Else, it begins pulling up receipts of people who are better than me in that skill, and begins comparing and saying that I can never be like them. And I have to tell myself, \"Yeah, you can never be like them if you don't put in the work. Do the work and you can be like them too\". But my brain is like, \"But they have 3 years of experience, you can never have that\" and this goes on and on until either my brain or I give up, and by then, both of us are exhausted.\n\nThe thing is, this isn't consistent at all. I cannot consistently code for a week, but I have been tracking calories for 400 days now without a break. I can power through the boredom of getting better in a task and practice shooting as a sport, but I cannot read a boring textbook which is needed to understand a subject I am interested in. I absolutely hate this inconsistency with myself and I view it as a sign of weakness.\n\nHow do I make my brain consistent in being disciplined? How can I make my brain not negotiate with me and exhaust me? How do I fulfill promises made to myself? How can I get started to put the effort to where I want to be?",

I cannot consistently code for a week, but I have been tracking calories for 400 days now without a break.\n\nIt sounds like you don't like coding but really care about your health/physical appearance. You're attempting to force yourself to do something you're not truly interested in or passionate about.\n\n> I can power through the boredom of getting better in a task and practice shooting as a sport\n\nSounds like you're interested in the task. Sounds like you have a knack for weapons.\n\n> but I cannot read a boring textbook which is needed to understand a subject I am interested in. I absolutely hate this inconsistency with myself and I view it as a sign of weakness. \n\nBut you're perhaps lying to yourself in saying that you care about this \"subject\".\n\nFor context, I worked on some game jams and pushed myself to code for like 12+ hours a day for 7 days a week, because I was having fun and wanted the result. I enjoyed the process and the potential outcome. If I didn't enjoy the process or the outcome, I wouldn't have done it.\n\nI don't particularly like programming. I've dabbled with it for an eternity, but have never shipped any really applications. But I love making games. So it tracks.\n\nI also try to tell myself I love all video games and I love playing them. I own nearly 1,500 of them. I've played maybe 300 of them. I tell myself to play the games, but I find myself burning out of playing certain kinds of them. I watch YouTube videos of others playing these types of games, but I just can't pull myself to push through and play them. Am I just wasting money? Most definitely at this point.\n\nSo yeah, maybe you just need to have a deeper look at yourself and be honest: do you sincerely enjoy the \"subjects\" you are focusing on? If it is, you shouldn't need to struggle with motivation to do them. The motivation should be built in.\n\nIf you're struggling to find the motivation, you need to have a moment of reflection and ask if you're really focusing your efforts on something that you really want to do. Because if it's not something you want to do, maybe it's worth asking if you should shift your focus towards something you can be more passionate about and have better outcomes from natural desire to do those things.\n\nAnyways, that's just my two cents.",

Often esp for neurodivergent types, the task initiation and executive dysfunction are majority causes for productivity, and just starting no matter how small can snowball into productive time. \n\nI often trick myself into doing something, but telling letting myself feel the motions and whilst im feelings, i tell myself 'look i know i feel like i cant do this all now, but at minimum i can move this dirty pile of clothes into hamper, or take the glass to the sink.' then when im there and doing something my brain can easily accommodate another task because the dopamine hit from accomplishing a teeny tiny task is enough motivation to go further. \n\nanother thing to do, is to have planner, and then when trying to do a task you dont want to, like going to the gym. You trick your brain with sidequests and sidethoughts. Like pack the gym bag, get water, get dressed. Focus all your attention on the setting up of the task, then take that small step/leap into doing something/anything and often the rest will follow. The trick here is to overload your brain with thoughts other than those of the task, so that when you get to the gym and already there you might as well do soemthing even if its small, and it snowballs. IF your brain cant have the time to have an emotional crisis over the task and its implications, your brain cant fully lock you out of doing it. \n\nIf you write out a goal and a process to achieve it, you can break down the tasks into small tasks, and take it one small step at a time. If you ever get overwhelmed, take the 5-55min to feel it if you need, and then take a small step forward. Eventually it will be easy to overcome your own brain with these small steps and trickery. \n\nAnd thats discipline in a nutshell, doing things when we said we would do, through mental gymastics to over come executive dysfunctione tc.",

But this is where I learned the countdown method. Alarm goes off? Countdown from three and just get up when you say “1”. It really helps your brain from not talking you out of doing whatever you were suddenly motivated to do. \n\n“Doing a task for at least 15 minutes” is a good thing to add on to the “countdown method”. \n\nScenario: “shoot I need to finish this work before my presentation next week.” Ok… 3, 2, 1, and I’m up! I immediately go to my clean and organized desk with the mindset that I’ll just do 15 minutes of work. I still use these two methods to do something when I don’t feel like it, but the intended 15 minutes of work now turns into hours of solid focus. \n\nDo this even on weekends, when you don’t have plans…. Training your mind to do something as soon as you have the motivation to do it, changes something in your brain and that consistent effort paired with even the slightest progress every day accumulates over time.",

I want to be a good professor. I really do, I spent years of my life studying. Yet I struggle to put in the work on an everyday basis. \n\nHow I identified the problem is : feeling like I did a good work, seeing students actually learn and being invested in my class is what I want and like. But I don't like scrolling endlessly on some archive Web page to find the right document to study with them in class. I don't like doing all the administrative tasks that come with being a professor. Etc.\n\n3. Gamification is a thing : our brain seeks quick and low effort rewards. That's just how it is, we are still apes trying to survive on a daily basis for our brain. So everytime I need to do something I don't enjoy in order to, further down the road, do something I actually enjoy, I divide the work in small tasks and reward myself when I complete one.\n\nResponded to some emails? Yeah, coffee time (I love coffee). Actually wrote down my plan for the next class? Yeah, snack time. Spend 1h grading student works? Yeah, time to grab my wife's butt and steal a kiss. Etc etc.\n\n4. We aren't meant to be working 8 or 10h a day. Realistically, we have maybe 3 to 5 good effective hours of work in ourself for a day. Not much more.

That allows your brain to signal to your muscles to start moving in order to get the thing done. \n\nIt’s frustrating as hell but knowing what’s going on helps you find tricks to get around it. External motivation helps: a deadline, money, friend, social obligation, etc.\n\nRoutine is another powerful one too. Much easier for your brain to tell your body what to do if it’s used to doing it regularly. Use treats or stimulants to help establish the routine and make lifestyle changes that can help you with or without medication.\n\nLook up PDA, it’s a characteristic of many adhd folks. Pathological demand avoidance, or persistent drive for autonomy. It’s like your brains fear wires get crossed with the demands because of past trauma when demands seemed insurmountable so now any demand feels like a threat to your nervous system which leads to avoidance. \n\nPerfectionist tendencies play in as well, you want to wait for the “perfect” time to do something or don’t want to do something you anticipate not being able to do perfectly.\n\nFind ways to follow your interests and channel them to get things done. Use your intellect to overcome executive function disabilities, be resourceful and creative to find work arounds. Good luck, you seem to be on the right track.",

I wake up roll over and take them, sometimes I lie in bed till they kick in other times I shuffle around and get ready before they help me tackle the day. I also take supplements. \n\nI find that if I am not taking care of myself physically and emotionally I am also far less inclined to do anything else. If you feel good, look good, you’ll do good. Take care of yourself and your mind and body will reward you. Sometimes I fall off my routine, however as soon as I pick it back up again I’m feeling like the best version of myself. It does take work and effort though and adhd meds have helped me get there. Good luck !",

Talk to a counseller first and possibly tune your sleep cycle (going to the gym the same time helped me back then, got me tired enough to shower and sleep) \n\nSecond, when learning tech the first time it's important to apply tech on something you are interested, create your own website with the stuff you learnt   \n\nThirdly, try different learning styles, one person's style is different from another, some prefer visuals others prefer hands on. If you are learning a programming language outside study, learning from textbook is very inefficient, try following an online tutorial on CRUD instead and add your creativity in it.   \n\nAlso, know that your brain is like a muscle, it takes small repetition for it to remember, so take a few minutes to tell yourself what does a piece of information is trying to teach you. \n\nRecord what concepts or techniques you learn, not how many problems you solved.

I tried to learn some coding at some point, I had end results that I wanted to reach that were simple and asked an LLM and kept asking it questions. LLMs helped a lot keeping me curious and engaged after that initial step. Whether I'm doing theoretical work or trying to do a simulation, I keep asking it questions. Asking it to summarize a page. Asking \"why?\" many, many times. Then repeating what I understood to confirm if I got it right.\n\nI also was using a productivity games on mobile, then on steam before all this. Has pomodoro timer built in. In the mobile app if I studied enough I could be able to plant a real tree. I have! On the steam one, it's more about romanticizing the study time. I set up a room, set up a view, let it rain in that world etc. \n\nAlso during undergrad I would keep going to the library. I wouldn't get the negotiation of my brain, even if I did, as long as you take action and don't just sit there and listen you forget about it. \n\nI dunno if any of these would help, as I just said \"just ignore it\" but I do have times when I can't ignore it. It's insane how convincing the arguments are when I need to wake up. I missed flights due to that. But thinking about it, I think I can't immediately take action when sleeping or when I just am barely awake. Thus I end up listening to that part. You gotta just cut the brain short, ignore and make your hands and feet work. If what you're doing is interesting enough, you lose yourself in the task anyways.",

That's not a person who lacks discipline.\n\nThe difference between tracking calories and sitting down to code isn't willpower. It's the number of decisions per minute. Tracking is one repeated choice: log or skip. Coding is hundreds of micro-decisions made back-to-back..  what to write, how to structure it, which approach, what to name things. Your brain calculates that cost before you even open the editor and starts negotiating to avoid it.\n\nThat's also why the negotiation gets louder as the tasks get harder. It's not the difficulty your brain is reacting to. It's the volume of unpredictable decisions it can see coming.\n\nWhat helped me was shrinking the decision count before starting. Not \"code for an hour\" but \"open the file and write the function name.\" One decision. Then the next one. The negotiation stops when the cost of starting is small enough not to trigger the avoidance.",

      "text": "I have a lot of „passive hobbies“: Gaming, drawing, crocheting and many more. I started working half a year ago after failing to find a fun university degree. So I went from sitting at home most of the time or sitting in a lecture hall to standing most of the day and doing handiwork. I like my job and most of the time it’s not that physical exhausting. But after work I literally can’t do anything. Once I sit down at my desk I feel too „weak“ to do anything that requires any focus. When I open a game I just run in circles and don’t properly play because I don’t really feel like doing anything specific and I don’t even try to draw because I can’t think of something. Yesterday I sat down at the couch and talked to my partner after work like we usually do and I instantly fell asleep after they got up to do something. I ended up sleeping for two hours and them making food even tho cooking is usually my responsibility. I feel guilty and bad if I do nothing. I wanna draw more since I wanna do art professionally some day, even if not as my main job, but also gaming is my way of socializing on weekdays but not being able to game because I‘m so exhausted is sad. I sleep enough and I eat rather healthy most of the time, the last time I got bloodwork done was a year ago and the results were fine. I want more meaningful free time. It’s not like I give 110% at work and over exhaust myself. What are things I can do to get more energy? I don’t spend a lot of time on social media (I have limited screen time on everything, 20 mins) and I don’t drink coffee, so it’s not like I’m feeling the caffeine low after work. The only thing I can think of is that I‘m rather unfit, I lost a lot of weight because I dieted so I look slim but I have no stamina nor strength. Any help is appreciated!!",

A balanced circadian rhythm makes it easier to sleep early at night, and wake up early in the morning. So do this in addition:\n\n5. Wake up early in the morning, 30 grams of protein in 30 minutes waking, and walk for 30 minutes (bath yourself in sun light). You dont need a perfect 8 hours of sleep to start doing this. 3 - 4 hours can do it. This is the reset/maintain of circadian rhythm part\n\n6. Add a zone 2 heart rate training, 20-30 minutes, or any type of training. This helps you sleep better at night since it's slowing your resting heart rate, making it more restful to sleep (improving sleep quality/deep sleep)",

However, after getting my pulse up, the brain fog lifts, and I feel fine - and then have no more brain fog, and am energized for the afternoon. \n\nNow I have kids, so there is no option to sit down at all after work until they are in bed most days. Running home from work, or working out in my lunch break really helps. Also, when the kids are in bed I do a short yoga session, that helps energize me and give me mental energy to focus on other things. \n\nSocial media = brain rot, it drains energy rather than give it.

Tell yourself you will only draw for 60 seconds .. like just one stick figure or a circle. Usually, the 'freeze' happens because the brain reads a big goal as a threat when you're tired. If you make the goal tiny, you bypass that threat response and often find you have just enough energy to keep going once the start is out of the way.",

          "text": "What you’re describing actually makes a lot of sense. You went from a mostly sedentary life to standing and doing handiwork all day. Even if it doesn’t feel “intensely physical,” your body is still adapting. Low level physical fatigue plus mental adjustment can hit harder than people expect. It’s not dramatic exhaustion, it’s just this flat drained feeling where your brain doesn’t want to initiate anything. The first thing I’d look at is basic physical capacity. You said you’re slim but unfit. That matters more than people realize. If your baseline stamina and strength are low, your job is taking a bigger percentage of your total energy. When your capacity is small, normal effort feels huge. Building even moderate strength and cardio can change that. Not extreme workouts. Just 2 to 3 short strength sessions a week and maybe light cardio. Over time your job will feel easier and you’ll have more left in the tank.\n\nSecond, stop going straight from work mode to “creative performance” mode. Your brain probably needs a transition. Right now you sit down and expect yourself to draw something meaningful or properly game. That’s pressure when you’re already tired. Try a 20 to 30 minute reset after work. Quick walk. Shower. Lie down with eyes closed but don’t sleep. Small snack with protein and carbs. Let your nervous system come down. Then choose one small intentional thing. Not “draw for two hours.” Just sketch for 15 minutes. Not “game all evening.” Just one match. Reduce the activation energy. Also, be careful with the after work nap. A two hour crash nap can make you groggier and steal your evening. If you really need it, set a 20 to 30 minute timer. Keep it short. Long naps can make the whole evening feel foggy.\n\nAnd honestly, some of this might just be an adjustment phase. Six months feels long but your body and brain are still adapting to a different rhythm of life. You are not lazy. You are adapting. The guilt is probably draining more energy than the job. You’re judging yourself for being tired instead of working with it. Instead of trying to have “perfect meaningful evenings,” aim for one intentional action per night. One sketch. One proper game session. One small step toward art. That keeps the identity alive without demanding superhero energy. If you build your physical base a bit, add a transition ritual, shorten naps, and lower the pressure on your hobbies, I think you’ll start feeling more in control of your evenings. Right now it sounds less like a motivation problem and more like a capacity and recovery problem. And those can actually be improved.",

          "text": "What have you tried doing instead?\n\nI'm currently trying to break a Reddit and Instagram habit. Various related thoughts:\n\n\\- My top priority is breaking the habit. Replacing it with something genuinely useful is a later goal.\n\n\\- So, for example, I've ordered some colored pencils and coloring books. I regard this as not-useful. But I'm hoping that the pleasure of the colors and the meditative manual activity might make it easier to resist grabbing the phone or laptop. Especially when the phone and laptop are in other rooms.\n\n\\- Similarly, I'm journaling with pencil and notebook. That's what I keep at hand, so that when my brain says, \"do something\" it's easy to grab that pencil and notebook. I don't demand that the journaling be at all creative or interesting. I just checked my journal--the last line I wrote was: \"Hmph. My arugula seed is missing.\"\n\n\\- I'm encouraging myself to do whatever paper-based thing I feel like, useful or not useful. List every book I own, with title and author, in my journal? Sure. Inventory my pantry? Sure.\n\n\\- I've found that reading nonfiction books, and taking notes on paper, keeps me a bit more absorbed than reading fiction. Now, you're in school, so that wouldn't have the novelty value for you that it has for me.\n\n\\- Interstitial journaling--keeping a journal of what I'm doing moment by moment--sometimes helps to keep me on task. I think the deal is that when my brain is tired of a boring task and demands a change of some kind, it will sometimes accept a change of hand-writing, \"Reading Chapter ten of Blah. Oh, my God, this is boring. Did they even hire an editor? OK, I'm getting a Coke. I will be back at it in fifteen minutes. FIFTEEN MINUTES. That's 4:21.\"\n\n\\- Speaking of doodling, various kinds of hand work can keep me from grabbing my phone. I learned how to darn socks, and I learned a beading stitch. One might argue that darning a sock and watching TV isn't useful, BUT it's also not social media. It's another example of breaking the habit first, and switching to useful things after the habit is broken.\n\nI guess this is essentially the same thing as the coloring book.\n\n\\- So, my main thought is to figure out a whole bunch of alternative things to do--to do with your eyes, your ears, your hands, your brain. Reading, watching movies, listening to music and taking notes (because music is so constantly present that just listening is an invitation to grab a phone), cooking, repairing things, etc., etc. And to make all of them as available as possible. \n\nIf your brain simply won't let you do schoolwork, you'll want to grab your phone, because it will be so absorbing that it will wash out the gulit at not doing schoolwork. Try to instead grab your journal or coloring book or something else.",

It might seem silly as an adult, but something like a sticker sheet, where you add a fun sticker to a board/sheet if you accomplish something, can help be a great motivator.\n\nOften times we just scold ourselves and feel guilty for not accomplishing things, without making sure to praise ourselves for acting how we’d like to.  Positive reinforcement is more effective than punishment.  Progress is not linear and one day of messing up routine does not mean you can’t do amazing the next day! \n",

Two years at 18 feels huge, but it’s not the end of your story.\n\nWhat you’re describing isn’t laziness — it sounds like a coping loop.

When you cut one out, it just swaps to another because the underlying feeling hasn’t changed.\n\nThe fact that you’re crying and aware of it means you care. That’s not apathy.\n\nInstead of trying to quit everything at once, try shrinking the loop. Don’t say “I’ll never use AI/Reddit again.” Say “I’ll study for 25 minutes, then I can scroll for 10.” Use timers. Make it structured instead of forbidden. Total restriction usually backfires.\n\nAlso — if you can, consider talking to a counselor at school. Not because you’re broken, but because this pattern is common and very fixable with the right support.\n\nYou’re not behind in life. You’re just stuck in a habit cycle. Habits can change.

          "text": "[I train professionals on topics & interventions under the “addiction” umbrella]\n\nAnything that can either increase pleasure or decrease suffering has the potential to be addictive. Essentially, whenever we engage in behaviours that are impacting our wellbeing overall & fail to stop despite acknowledging that it’s happening, it is genuinely fulfilling some form of an unmet need, but is also what we’d define as “addiction”.\nWhether that could be a sense of safety, loneliness, imposter syndrome or whatever else. The problem is that through repetition, the behaviours become automatic & can feel like something else is controlling you to do a thing even when you’re actively thinking “I shouldn’t do this” - simply “saying no” or focusing on “just not doing it” generally doesn’t work, especially not long term, as the urge to engage in avoidance is the symptom rather than the main issue.\nVast majority of people recover from similar things on their own, these are more or less, in a nutshell, the steps you could consider to begin with -\n1. Competing interest - something within your core that you sincerely hold to be more sacred than the behaviour. Has to be value based, yours, not “shoulds”. Really mediate on that and sit with the discomfort of it emerging\n2. Active awareness - begin to notice the patterns of when this happens, just the urges, when they’re the loudest, what the routines look like, the times of day, the emotions attached to the urges. Just noticing. You don’t have to do anything about it other than call it out as it happens. This is to try to dig it out from your subconscious to your conscious\n3. Displace & replace - Through trial and error, begin to literally change your environment. I do mean that in a literal sense. The way that your room looks/furniture layout. Start to break certain associations, maybe do certain things you do at different times (Essentially jumble up the patterns you identified in step 2) - this should begin to break the autopilot and make it feel more like a choice. Replace it with something else; something good for you, something that makes you feel connected or proud of yourself. That then, over time, becomes your routine.\n\nAfter that, it’s the maintenance part and figuring out what the unfulfilled need is, as other things will over time crop up that you’ll likely engage in to try and escape reality for a little while.\n\nIt does sound to me that you may be very burnt out due to living up to some expectation that you didn’t choose; I could be completely wrong, but that may be something to think about.\n\nYou got this.",

Floors keep the identity alive; ceilings are just bonus credit.\n2. Pre-log the friction you expect (kids waking up, late meetings, low energy) and write a default response now. When the obstacle hits you just run the script instead of renegotiating with yourself.\n3. Audit the scoreboard weekly: % of days you hit the floor, % of days you exceeded it, and one tweak for the next cycle. The scoreboard is what convinces your brain the micro actions are compounding.\n\nIf you want a plug-and-play version of that scoreboard, 3D Habits was built exactly for daily micro floors + weekly audit prompts + accountability nudges.

Im writing this and it feels productive, feels nice but ik I’ll wake up tomorrow just to repeat this endless cycle of endless scrolling and frying my brain. What should i do ? I mean i might even get advice but i wont act on it, this is like the one thing and the only thing that i really wanna change about my self, this is the only thing that is holding me back from growing and i cant bring myself to change. What should i do ?\n\nEdit: just wanna say i wasn’t expecting such positive feedback. I wanna thank everybody for their words of encouragement and trying to help me out, i always used to think no one would really care about my problems so i never talk about them, but you guys did and I’m really thankful for that, hopefully you guys don’t find me handful. Ok im gonna quit yapping and show my appreciation by saying thanks😭✋.",

I creat as much friction as possible but i just relapse. I guess its because i never replace my phone hours with something else. Cuz ill delete the apps and start watching youtube on my pc. Aren’t i a piece of art 😭👍.\n\nI think i always slip up on the resting part. Lets suppose i get a productive day i do everything or did the bare minimum productive thing. Lets take studying for an hour, but after that where i always used to slip up was the resting part, i didn’t know what to do while i was resting and i sure dont wanna just stare at the wall, i mean it might work for a few days but it dosent sound that good. So because every time i relapsed in the resting phase my brain is probably like “why even bother trying when the result is gonna be the same”… how should i fill my blank time with ? What can a person do to rest ? Maybe reading a book it is.",

Instead of trying to white knuckle willpower, I would create friction.\n\nLog out of YouTube on your phone. Delete it entirely if you can. Only allow it on your PC. Make the easy option slightly inconvenient.\n\nAnd instead of trying to eliminate scrolling all day, shrink the window. Pick one block of the day where you are allowed to scroll guilt free. Outside of that window, phone stays physically away from you.\n\nRelapse does not mean you cannot change. It just means your system is not strong enough yet. Adjust the system, not your self worth.",

At least not when you keep telling yourself you can't. \n\n**As the saying goes: \"Whether you believe you can, or you can't, you are correct\".** \n\nYou have to first believe that you can change your mind. Doom scrolling is a learned response. It is a behavioral pattern that was taught to you through the process of dopamine addiction and other addictive patterning. \n\nThat's the good news. As it was a learned response, it can be unlearned. Perhaps not overnight, but you can do it. It's much like choosing to get healthier. We learn to sit on the couch all day watching TV. It's easy, we eat, we get fatter. \n\nIF you make the choice to get up, eat less, exercise more, and make that choice daily, you will get leaner. This is because your choices changed, and then your patterns changed. \n\nYes, your body and your brain will fight against this change. Your body will hate you. Your brain will get foggy, maybe even have headaches. You will get tired. \n\nThis happens because you're trying to fight against the grain. You're taking active steps to alter your habits, and this takes repeated, enforced \"training\". \n\nAnd it is training. It generally takes upwards of 30 or more iterations of the same event to begin the process of transforming an action into a habit. This shortens for bad habits and gets much harder for good habits. This is because the good habits are not reinforced with sugary sweets, soft couches, warm beds, soda, ot a 12-hour Netflix binge session. \n\nYou can do it. You must want to do it. So badly, like breathing air. The more you want it, the more you will push for it. But it starts with belief. ",

This is draining to your body, mind, and spirit. \n\nI trust you on the \"external motivation helps a lot\". But this is the truth about life. Someday, all that will not be there to do so, and you will still have to get your own ass out of bed. \n\nAs we age, our children move out, our parents move on, and friends get married and drift away.\n\nDoing things like going to the gym (being an athlete), becomes part of our identity. When we can't go to the gym for extended periods, let's say due to an injury, we often \"disconnect\" with that identity. \n\nConcerns with Identity crisis have been pretty well documented. This is because as humans, we place such a high level of resonance on these things. This is where saying things about yourself, such as \"I am lazy,\" also strikes a nerve. \n\nThe subconscious mind is always listening to how you present yourself, to yourself, and to others. By declaring your \"state\", you are in essence telling your subconscious mind \"to engage that state\". \n\nSo if you want more pressure, \"tell yourself and others\", what you want to be, not what you \"might feel like in the moment\". It can make a world of difference. \n\nANd Nope, not bored at all. Feel free to reach out anytime.",

Implement a pause mechanism, whenevrr you're about to do something, take 3 slow deep breaths first, this makes you take more logical action rather than emotional\n\n2. Keep daily track of any moment you start scrolling so after some time you have a clear cues that whenever any of them happens you start scrolling, so next time you put them in perspective\n\n3. Surround yourself with things only related to your current task\n\n4. Learn how to negotiate with yourself, talk to yourself as if you're the worker and the employer, the teacher and the student, the son and the father.. if you feel like procrastinating tell yourself something like 'i can't open my phone until i do X for atleast 15 minutes'\n\n5. The 5-minute rule, wenever you're about to procrastinate something, stop thinking and grab that thing and work on it for just 5 minutes, at worst case you will have done some work, best case you will continue the work as you already broke the procratination\n\n",

Find a new habit you want to do instead of doom scrolling and if you can genuinely envision a version of yourself being that person. For example, if you want to read books instead of doom scrolling then you'd envision yourself as a reader. It could also help to stack the new habit you want with an old habit, so if you do them together it becomes more natural. If you find yourself doomscrolling at night before bed, read a page of a book during or right after you brush your teeth.",

Overthinking is the problem that is an obsessive type of behaviour.\n\nBy taking away the thinking and being scared of your thoughts you take away the chance for self improvement and healing. You would start having poor sleep or nightmares because your subconscious is doing all of the heavy lifting now to get the message across. If by end of the day you don’t have any space for reflection, then how are you going to learn from your mistakes? How are you going to understand why you feel how you feel?\n\nThere’s no visible harm with listening to music all day, but it would likely impact your long term future by affecting your potentials for happiness and maintaining a healthy relationship with others.\n\nTry meditation, start with guided meditation and aim for silent meditation. If your thoughts are killing you, it might be worth getting yourself checked sometimes in the future.

          "text": "Presuming you didn't use AI to come to this conclusion.  This notion is a false binary tho.\n\n\"AI does the thinking for you\" only happens if you CHOOSE to outsource the thinking.  A calculator can make you \"bad at arithmetic\" or it can free you to focus on higher level math.  A search engine can make you shallow or expose you to ideas you'd never find otherwise.  Saying a tool is the deciding factor is inaccurate.  The user is.\n\nAI can absolutely short circuit learning but so does copying your friend's homework.  That's not new, AI is just a faster way to copy someones work.\n\nAI can also:\n\nExplain a topic 5 different ways at varying levels of complexity to enhance comprehension.\n\nSimulate debate so you can pressure test ideas.\n\nGenerate practice problems to test comprehension.\n\nHelp identify patterns in complex disciplines that would be difficult for many to ever get to.\n\nI'd suggest an alternative to \"thinking for you\"  the tool is a cognitive scaffolding.\n\nYeah, if I want shit answers I can post up shit questions but I've found that metacognition is stronger because I've had to articulate and refine what I'm trying to accomplish much more clearly.  The quality of output you get is directly tied to the clarity of your thinking and problem definition.  This feedback loop is pretty powerful.\n\nInsofar as \"hint instead of answer\" that's really useful in learning contexts but in the professional context sometimes the faster answer is exactly what is required.  Efficiency matters and not every task I do needs to be a socratic seminar.\n\nSo for my part I'd answer C to your above question.  Context is critical.\n\nIf i'm trying to master a concept guided thinking is better.\n\nIf I'm trying to ship a deliverable by 5pm I want to define the problem be prompted with several solutions, refine and execute.\n\nIn short, IMO, AI isn't \"replacing cognition\" it's changing where we spend it.\n\n  \n\\*\\* now if you want to talk about AI controlled weaponry, defensive and offensive capabilities. I'm awake at night over that. ;)",

Sometimes that’s reading, sometimes it’s just sitting there half-awake staring into space. The key was no email, no socials, no chaos.\n\nAlso, fix your sleep first.

It's not. If 7am works for you, that's great! As long as you're being productive and it's not detrimental to your health, it doesn't matter when you wake up\n\nPersonally, I wake up at 5am simply because I like to watch the sun rise.

I know that a natural response would probably be that it means that \"thats because your home must feel like your safe space and hence your body relaxes\", but it feels a bit more inherently dysfunctional than that. I feel TOO fatigued at home like I feel it in my bones, and this is literally any minute of the day or night that I'm inside my home. Its almost like my home casts this veil/spell on me and then it incapacitates me from even being able to do the simplest of tasks. Like I feel like I don't even have the strength to pick up two items, or sometimes to even get up and shower or pour a cup of water, and sometimes the tiredness even turns into physical symptoms like a headache. I literally almost feel drugged when im at home. And it stresses me out to see the mess my place has become because of it, because I cant function enough to think as clearly or clean at all. \n\nNow on the other hand, when im at work or any one elses house, I clean like a professionally paid cleaner, do it super fast and well, and also become super efficient at tackling tasks. I literally become super woman compared to the completely different incapacitated me within any inch inside of my home.  \n\nWhy is that ? and I would really love to fix it so that I can be just as high functioning in my own home. My home and I deserve it just as much \n\nEven right now as I type this on my couch I feel so weak and sleepy (both physically and mentally) that its uncomfortable to keep on typing in between. I literally feel like a shell of myself and its even physical, my brain even feels like it got cut off of 50% of its ability and strength and im fighting to stay alert. As I mentioned, I feel drugged when I'm at home and I dont take anything \n\nIs this .... normal? Any insights you can share with me that might give me some answers ?

I’m wondering if it’s easier to clean other people’s spaces than our for multiple reasons: 1) there’s a third party person whom you feel accountable to, 2)there’s a set to-do list/expectations are clear and defined, 3) there’s a time limit, 4) there’s an incentive (emotional: care about the relationship w/person who’s house you’re at, financial: paid for working, etc), 5) burnout (ADHD/Autism peeps struggle more frequently), 6)underlying perfectionism.\n\nI do believe there’s a lot of shame embedded in the language we use (hint: “should”= “shame”). If you’re like me, I struggle keeping promises with my self, and people-please and over-extend myself often. Looking around my home in slightly less disarray currently than 3 months ago, reframing the “I should be cleaning” to “I deserve a clean and functional home too” has helped make more progress all around our property than in the past 5 living here. Granted, I still stress myself out from wanting to do all of the things/home improvements/garden projects all at once right now and cry a little on the inside that I’m not currently independently wealthy and able to hire out these projects to see the progress I want to see on a short timeframe…. \n\nFind small ways to work on trusting yourself and what you say you’ll do and actually do it. Start small. Let the momentum snowball. Find a body double or invite a friend over (either to help or to motivate you to clean to baseline). Define goals and associate them with incentive, define time parameters/deadline, narrow down scope for milestones, and then execute the plan consistently. The frequency of “consistency” is what’s sustainable for you (5 min a day, 20 min every 3 days, etc). My goals don’t care about my feelings but sometimes, I really can’t do anything and that’s okie too. Give yourself grace for struggling, and rely on discipline over motivation. Habits are built by the discipline to be in consistent action; motivation just inspires the goal. \n\nRooting for you! Remember if you’re riding the struggle bus, you’re still moving forward. Progress over perfection.",

In my current job, my goal is to give a 70%, which is far more than what my colleage is able to deliver lol.\n\nAt home, I choose only one or two things to do each day and try to do them with a little help of my favourite musics.

As others have said, setting a timer and telling yourself you'll only work for 5 mins is a really good idea! I also try different settings so I'll take myself out to a cafe or pub if I need a change of scenery and it usually gets my brain working at a different pace - the thought of people watching me not work is enough to make me work. Even going for a short walk around the block (with no distractions / phone) gets the blood going in your brain and sometimes motivates me with new ideas / plans to get working once I return to my laptop.",
