      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nNothing dramatic. No 5 am routines or “changed my life overnight” stuff. Just boring little habits that i added.\n\n• I stopped reacting immediately. Messages, comments, even bad news. Pausing for a few minutes saved me a lot of unnecessary stress.\n\n• I keep my phone out of reach while working or eating. Not off. Just not in my hand. Huge difference.\n\n• I started finishing the smallest task first. Making the bed, clearing one email, washing one dish. Momentum matters more than motivation. The Soothfy App provides the Anchor + Novelty framework to make my workflow clear and consistent.\n\n• I stopped over-explaining myself. A simple “no” or “I can’t” is enough most of the time.\n\n• I go outside every day, even if it’s just 5 minutes. Sounds silly, but it resets my head better than scrolling.\n\n• I realized watching random content while tired wasn’t relaxing at all. so i choose sleeping more than any hack I tried.",

It wasn’t really the show itself, it was having something queued up that felt just for me, before the day got noisy. That anticipation does a lot of work mentally.\n\nWhat helped me long term was swapping passive excitement for small intentional things. Simple stuff like a proper coffee I actually enjoy, a short walk with a podcast I only listen to in the morning, or spending twenty minutes working on something that feels like it’s slowly improving my life. Not exciting in the same dopamine way, but it builds a quieter pull to get up.\n\nI think the key difference is that shows give instant payoff, while routines give delayed payoff. The trick is making the delayed ones feel personal enough that your brain still wants them. Once I framed mornings as time I get to keep, not time I have to survive, it got easier.\n\nI’ve been thinking about this a lot lately around habits, money, and motivation in general. I write a bit about it from a normal perspective, nothing extreme. It’s on my profile if you’re curious, but either way you’re definitely onto something here.",

Your brain doesn’t wake up for discipline, it wakes up for anticipation. The trick is finding something low-stakes and repeatable, not something you binge and burn out on like a series. One small thing you genuinely enjoy in the morning is enough. It doesn’t have to be “productive.” It just has to be yours.",

The act of creating a tangible list makes it more likely to stick around in your brain, and the visual cue keeps attention flowing to it. \n\nIf you're into planning and like sticking to schedules, you might look ahead at your course load for each week and set up post-class activities per day. Maybe schedule gaming or shows/movies for heavy academic days, and reading/writing for the light ones. \n\nYou might also automate task switching, if that works better with your brain. Set up automations with Shortcuts / equivalent, reminders, alarms, etc., that automatically transition you out of one \"focus mode\" to the next. This might look like having your home smart lighting change colors at a certain time, or setting up a shortcut that makes your computer go into airplane mode at 6 pm. \n\nThe key takeaway is to reduce the barrier of entry to the tasks you want to do! Self-discipline is often little more than good habits & structure.",

Otherwise, I know I'd get overwhelmed. Keeping it to a minimum helps make it more manageable. Then, only if feasible, I'll add more tasks one at a time. But I'm just trying to get by right now. I can't go all superhuman overnight; that'll never be sustainable.\n\nI will acknowledge that using the app is yet another thing to do on my list, and I just started using it, but I'm trying it for now.\n\nI think I reached a point where I realized that my lack of productivity had to change. I couldn't keep letting everything go and letting it pile up. I still don't want to do anything but I'm trying to force myself even when I just want to escape. And again, keeping it small for now is helping me feel like it's more possible to get a handle on everything. But really, wanting to keep my streak going is very motivating lol\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk!",

I started using it again 3 weeks ago and I have SO much more energy! I always crash in fall and bounce back in spring, and my light therapy lamp has made it feel like it's spring in February.\n* Adderall. Whenever I feel like I have a lot of energy but I feel jittery or unfocused, more Adderall is usually the answer. For whatever reason it always makes me feel calm in those situations instead of amping me up more like you would expect with a stimulant.\n* Doing a better job of resting. Meditation, taking quality breaks, sleeping more, relaxing more etc. Maybe it's common sense, but I find the more well rested I am, the more relaxed I am, and the less pressure I put on myself the more I actually get done and the less I procrastinate.\n\nFor a few months I was getting very little done. These things have allowed me to get a ton done in the last couple of weeks. And my biometrics on my watch have shot up, too!",

Are you negative all the time, or feel upset about small things a lot more? Anxiety about something?\n\nDid you have the flu or a big illness before this started? Takes a few months to get back all the depleted nutrients in the body after viral.\n\nIn the meantime, try pomodoro (focusmate is a good website for co-working) - but likely the reason is not lack of willpower or discipline. So keep a journal of exactly what is happening (getting distracted? feeling tired? feeling bored? muscle pain? feeling upset? anxiety?) -- it'll help you see the patterns.\n\nWhat you're describing is very similar to ADHD and anxiety.

      "text": "morning routines...., ah I like these 2 words which people usually using to describe what they perfect mornings look like, what they do in the mornings, etc. You know, these videos from Instagram people doing bunch of the stuff in the morning and u just look at this: what th is that? Like get up at 5am, сold water with ice, smear your face with a banana, etc.\n\nAll this is performative bs and survivorship bias. I don't know anynone in real life who actually doing all these bunch things in the mornings, lol.\n\nSo, let's start not from the morning, but before that -> your evenings. They matter exactly the same, even more than mornings. Think about what u doing before sleep? Watching something? Dinner?\n\nI found some things essential in the evenings, mostly time before sleep\n\n\\-> no phones at least 1 hour before sleep (you probably already heard about blue light) and it really breaks your sleep quality. Worse sleep = worse morning\n\n\\-> no dinner close to sleap like 3 hours (your body need to relax and actually be ready for the next day, not digest all things you eat before)\n\n\\-> I also found from personal experience that I need to avoid stress or sport just at the late evenings. Otherwise, I just can't fall asleep at least 30 minutes, it depends on the person overall, but Im that kind who thinks a lot\n\n\\-> Make your room between hot and cold, something like a bit less warm, open window and let your room fill with fresh air, comfortable sleep is the best\n\n\\-> plan your day ahead + go sleep at the same time, no more 1 more series at late night\n\noh, okay, that's already much in one post, so morning tips (i don't wanna make fluff here):\n\n\\-> wake at the same time, even in the weekends\n\n\\-> avoid scrolling at any price in the first 2 hours. What I found from myself -> open scrolling, even 10 minutes -> day feeling like a shit, can't do anything productive fr\n\n\\-> shower + meditation is one of the best combos I found. You first wake up -> no phone -> go to shower, while you drying out, meditation and thinking about what you gonna do this day, this literally helps me a lot\n\nThat's something like this, I could include more info but don't wanna look like a big damn article. Ofc you shouldn't follow all the rules, start small, adapt what works for you, Im just sharing what works for me. It would be also good idea to share what helped you in comments, so people can adapt your tips as well\n\nseee yaaaa",

That lost feeling is basically your brain going wait... we have free time and no one is telling us what to consume? It doesnt know what to do with itself because social media was filling every gap of boredom for years.\n\nAs an artist you actually have such a huge advantage here. Some ideas for your offline time:\n\n- Sketchbook work. Not on the iPad, actual pencil and paper. Its a totally different creative muscle and theres something about the tactile feel that hits different.\n\n- Go to a coffee shop or park and draw what you see. Observational drawing is insanely good for improving your art AND it gets you out of the house.\n\n- Physical movement. Doesnt have to be a gym thing. Walk, stretch, dance in your room. Your body has been sitting while scrolling for years and it needs to move.\n\n- Cook something new. Seriously. Following a recipe is productive, creative, and you eat at the end of it. Win win win.\n\n- Just sit and be bored. I know this sounds unhelpful but learning to be comfortable with silence and empty space is one of the most powerful things you can do. Thats where your best creative ideas will come from.\n\nThe fact that you dont know what to do without social media shows exactly why quitting was the right call. Give yourself grace - it takes about 2-3 weeks for your brain to stop looking for the quick dopamine hit and start finding joy in slower things.",

This is when I let my mind drift and do whatever comes to mind - dishes, planning for groceries, things that I've been putting off\n\n\\- I've also added a 30 minute workout goal, whenever I want to reach my phone, i asked myself, did I do my workout yet?\n\n\\- Overtime, I become more curious of some subjects and hobbies. I recently take up air dry clay and started learning art history with ChatGPT.\n\nHope this helps, and best of luck to you!",

So as for what you should do, indulging in other activities, you see, I would suggest that it depends on your goals, what you want to achieve, and then those goals turn into your daily actions to help you reach them. But if you want to spend your time in some better activities, I would suggest you start working on your body by doing some workouts and learning some new skills. Since you seem to be a creative fella, how about learning writing, editing, or graphic designing? Maybe that will work. You can try them as well, and like, watch something educational as well on any topic you're interested in, you always wanted to know about. \n\nAside from that, there are several activities you can do, like walking or spending time with yourself alone. Yeah, those boring breaks, just sitting with your own mind, understanding and hearing your own thoughts. Because most people don't do it, that's why we feel so conflicted most of the time or overwhelmed. You can try meditating. Believe me, it will help a lot. You will feel a lot better, both in your mood and energy. And look, no matter what you pick, you just have to set time, so much effortless and short for it at first, then gradually increase. Like meditating for 5 minutes, or you know what's even better? Setting challenges to do daily, like 50 push-ups or 100 push-ups. These are also best for you. You can do it with pull-ups as well, like whatever you want. I hope this will help. Peace.",

If you’re already drawing a lot on the iPad, that’s great, but when you’re not, don’t try to replace social media with something equally stimulating. That just turns into another screen habit. Some days I read, some days I just sit with music, some days I do nothing useful at all. That’s still rest.\n\nAlso, it’s okay if your days feel slower. You don’t need to fill every gap with productivity. A short walk, stretching, cleaning one small thing, flipping through an art book, even just staring out the window for ten minutes, that stuff matters more than it sounds. Boredom is usually where better ideas show up.\n\nYou’re not failing at balance. You’re just in the awkward in-between where your brain is relearning how to exist without constant input.

I only really use Reddit, but I don’t count it.\n\nmy time and productivity has improved significantly. at first, it was quite difficult as I’m a young adult, & also a business student. you soon realize little to no one cares about your life online, and neither should you about others. the active feeling of fomo is what makes social media so addictive. \n\nask yourself, why are you so compelled to go on X apps? I’m still improving with some apps (I frequent Pinterest fairly often), but whenever I feel like it’s useless consuming instead of intentional, I remind myself of other things I could be doing. tbh, I struggle with it less now that my academics have gotten a lot more intense where I don’t have spare time. \n\non my school breaks, almost every single day of summer/holiday break, I was constantly doing something hobby related. sewing, drawing, baking, etc. hanging out with people is fulfilling too. \n\nwhile there are so many things I’ve done in my pursuit of betterment, a large thing I’d suggest is journaling. I’ve been doing it more or less for the last seven years, but when I really began implementing it in my life consistently is when I noticed change. specifically an improvement journal, and a planner. when you write into action what you’d like to achieve, new things you’d like to try; it becomes more of a desire rather than a passing thought, and you are inclined to put it into action more instead of mindless social media scrolling.\n\nsorry for the long mumble jumble! hope this helps :)",

That doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong or that you’re suddenly unproductive. It just means you’re not being constantly fed noise anymore. It feels like boredom but it’s really your attention resetting.\n\nAs an artist especially, that gap matters. Creativity usually comes after boredom, not before it. Sitting there not knowing what to do, staring out the window, walking with no podcast on, doing something slightly pointless. That’s often when ideas show up later on, even if it doesn’t feel productive in the moment. Rest without stimulation still counts as rest.\n\nYou also don’t need to replace social media with something equally intense. Reading a few pages, sketching badly on purpose, cleaning one small thing, going for a short walk, then stopping. It’s fine if your days feel quieter and smaller for a while. You’re not wasting time, you’re learning how to be alone with your thoughts again.\n\nIf you’re interested, I write about attention, money, and modern life stuff like this from a very normal perspective.

Once they got their gift, they blocked me on here (not sure why) but didn’t block me on the other platform (they likely forgot to). I blocked them there.\n\nI gift with no expectations since it’s free for me and I’m happy to help those who aren’t as fortunate.

The person writing the email or message sees it as neutral at worst, but when we read it, our brain interprets it more negatively than it was intended. There are lots of reasons for this, including the ones you mentioned. \n\nWe’re hardwired for a negative bias generally, this is a survival instinct. At work, this is our livelihood and our income and reputation are on the line, so that survival instinct (like a physical fight or flight reaction) becomes more psychological. \n\nIt’s also complicated by office politics and hierarchies, if there’s an unconscious belief of some kind of fight for power, whether in role or a project. We might interpret something as negative if someone is a higher rank than us, or they could be the same level but we feel like they’re trying to act like they’re above us. \n\nBut it’s also the same as any other written communication outside of work - there’s no tone of voice or facial expression or body language, and this makes up so much of a communication that without it you could read a message in almost any way. This is exacerbated by so much remote working. \n\nAdd in some overthinking, paranoia, work stress, or just general anxiety, and emails are an absolute nightmare.",

So while they loved to defend their one word replies and incredibly short/half assed responses when they were the sender and the topic wasn't important to them, their tune changed when they were the recipients of short half assed replies when they were the recipients and the conversation was important to *them*.\n\nEdit: One I remember was the team member wanting to set up a meeting to go over their performance, progression and to discuss a raise.  They were a middle of the road employer overall but their communication was... Infuriating and often caused issues. So I spoke to HR beforehand to clear it first and then engaged in the same half assed, dismissive, couldn't be bothered to put any effort in when it came to setting up the meeting and going over the review.... After several \"ok\" \"ya fine\" \"sure\" \"I guess\" responses over the week to their setting up a time, sending over a list of accomplishments etc they were so discouraged that they asked to cancel the meeting altogether because they felt it  was pointless because it was obvious I wasn't going to give them a raise or a positive review.\n\n... Guess who finally got the point that it's wholly unacceptable to respond to an e-mail containing several ideas and points and which requires information in the response with an \"ok\".  Or that a *thumbs up* isn't an appropriate acknowledgement of task assignments.",

      "text": "I've tried everything to stay consistent with self-improvement. Habit trackers, accountability partners, motivational quotes on my wall even. Nothing lasted more than 3 weeks.  I honestly started feeling incapable / not meant for it.\n\nThe problem wasn't discipline. It was that I kept forgetting I was actually making progress.\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\nI start strong. First week, I hit the gym 4 times, meal prep Sunday, wake up at 6 AM. I feel unstoppable.\n\nWeek 3, I miss a workout. Then two. I sleep in one day. Suddenly I feel like I'm \"falling off\" and the voice in my head says \"see, you always do this.\" FUCK.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'm not actually back at zero. I just forgot about the 15 workouts I crushed, the 12 early mornings, the week I stuck to my meal plan perfectly.\n\nThe human brain has a negativity bias. Turns out we remember the misses way more than the wins. So even when we are objectively progressing, it feels like we're failing.\n\n# What changed for me:\n\nI started keeping a \"Win Log.\"\n\nEvery single day, I write down 1-3 things I actually did. Not what I planned to do. Not what I \"should\" have done. Just what I actually executed on.\n\nSome examples from my log:\n\n* \"Went to gym even though I felt like shit\"\n* \"Had a hard conversation with my gay brother I'd been avoiding\"\n* \"Didn't doom scroll for 2 hours before bed\"\n* \"Followed through on my morning routine\"\n* \"Applied to 3 jobs\"\n\n# Why this works:\n\n**1. You create evidence.**\n\nWhen your brain tells you \"you're not capable,\" you have a list proving otherwise. On day 32, when I wanted to quit, I scrolled through my log and saw 31 days of proof that I *can* execute. That's not motivation.  That’s fucking data.\n\n**2. You break the amnesia cycle.**\n\nMost people only remember the last 3 days of their journey. Everything before that is fuzzy. The Win Log makes your progress tangible. You can literally see how far you've come. This creates an infinite loop where your wins fuel your actions, which then fuel your wins, which then fuel your actions..  So you’re naturally able to just keep going\n\n**3. It reframes \"bad\" days.**\n\nEven on days I felt like I failed, I could usually find 1-2 small wins. \"Didn't work out, but I did drink 2L of water and got 7 hours of sleep.\" Literally didn’t fail.\n\n# The rule I follow:\n\nLog at least 1 win per day. No matter what.\n\nEven if it's \"I got out of bed.\" Even if it's \"I didn't give up.\" Something.\n\nBecause here's the truth: you're probably doing way better than you think. You're just not keeping score.\n\nYour wins are fuel. But only if you remember them.\n\n**TLDR:** Started logging daily wins instead of tracking habits. Turns out I wasn't failing, I just had amnesia about my progress. When you feel like quitting, concrete evidence of past execution is way more powerful than motivation.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nWow, didn't expect this to resonate with so many people (it's my first post anywhere to get attention). Thank you for sharing your own stories about struggling with negative self-talk, it's wild how universal this experience is.\n\nJust to clarify how this is different from a habit tracker: **Habits feel like obligation. Wins are evidence of capability.** One creates pressure, the other creates confidence through proof\n\nFor anyone asking what I use to keep everything organized: I use an app called **\"CTRL - Self Improvement OS\"** to log my wins.  It's the best looking app I have installed",

Smart.\n\nOne thing I started doing that pairs well with this: I mark wins as either \"showed up\" or \"crushed it.\" So even on days where I just got out of bed or did one pushup, it still counts as a show-up win. Takes the pressure off having to be perfect while still keeping the streak alive.\n\nWeek 3 is brutal though.

And to be honest, I still find myself slipping back into it sometimes.\n\nFirst thing, you might be burned out, depressed, or some messy combo of both. If you can talk to a therapist or a doctor, I really think it’s worth doing. And you don’t have to wait until things get “bad enough” to deserve help.\n\nWhat helped me most was stopping the constant “I need to fix myself” pressure. When you’re already burnout, pushing harder usually makes it worse. So for a while, I gave myself permission to do nothing without guilt. Rest is not failing, it’s recovery.\n\nAt my darkest time, I had anxiety and depression hitting at the same time, plus physical symptoms. I didn’t want to eat, didn’t want to talk to anyone, just wanted to disappear. At the same time I desperately wanted someone to be there, and I also felt terrified of being a burden to them. It’s a brutal mindset.\n\nOne mindset shift that helped was realizing this: even if you have friends and family around, you’re still the person who has to take your own hand. No one is coming. That sounds harsh, but for me it was weirdly empowering.I stopped waiting to “be helped or healed” and just focused on tiny steps I could actually do.\n\nSo here’s what I’d suggest\n\n* First, for now, give yourself a break. Stop pushing yourself to do things. You’re not lazy, you’re just out of gas.\n* Second, really hold onto this: if you feel like you’re at rock bottom, then any tiny thing you do counts as moving forward. Seriously. Eating something, sleeping, making it through the day. If you’re still here today, that’s progress.\n* Third, can you still eat? Can you still keep work going at least a little? Then just focus on that kind of basic stuff. Do what you have energy for. When you don’t, lie down. Rest. The more you force it, the more burned out you get.\n* Fourth, it can help to listen to people who’ve been through it. Like podcasts or videos that are just real, human stories not the super sciencey how to fix your life stuff. Just hearing someone say yeah I was there too and this is how I got through it can make you feel less alone.\n\nAnd again, if you can, please reach out to a doctor or therapist. You don’t have to carry this by yourself, even if it feels like you should.\n\nYou’re not lazy. You’re not a failure. You sound exhausted. And that’s something you can come back from.",

I often get inspiration from subreddits like \nr/biohacking \nr/MTHFR r/Supplements r/B12_deficiency and the likes.\nTo get laboratory tests you need to get a sample and get it sent to a lab. It is often easier to do at the doctor. Some tests are ok to order online and send samples by mail. SNP array tests like Ancestry's is cheap but still useful. After the test, you download results and then you upload them to third parties (e.g. geneticgenie) that help you analyse results. If you see genes reported that have some clinical significance you can research them further. If you have your symptoms and labs and genes you are a million miles closer to understanding what might be a bit out of whack. The other part of my learning journey has been to try supplements that claim some benefit I am interested in, research how they are supposed to work and if (3 out of 4 do nothing) they make a significant difference then try to figure out a theory of why. (Not always easy so don't try forever). My top tips are vitamin D, magnesium, an active forms B-complex, to research the methylation cycle and boost it, research ATP generation and boost that too.",

Then add some exercise 5 to 10 minutes a day.  Remember, you’re crawling out of a hole not running a marathon.  You’re gonna need help so call upon any friend you have to meet you for coffee. To come over and say hi.  Whatever. Ask your parents for help since you’re still living with them.  Ask them if they’ll go for a walk with you.  Try to eat dinner with them nightly.  Conversation and human connection does wonders for resetting the brain.  Let me know how this goes. I really do care.",

This strategy would most likely resolve most of your motivation, emotion and enery problems as well as make life fun.\n\nGood on the gym. You are still young at 27. Can you create a goal to work towards also with your degree for motivation as well as the above social group support system method perhaps with other maths students?\n\nJoin some clubs where they do activities that help you forget about yiur work and get you out of your head also… can you think of some? Try to split room and sleep from study and work spaces if you can also and try to allocate time at each and not over do any of these either.\n\nGood luck and I am sure you will find a good way forwards.",

At least, it's something people do in my university/degree, and it's how I've found my best friends. However, as in any point in life, people can just sort of fall outside of any friend groups, whether due to social anxiety, depression, neurodivergence, and/or \"just not fitting in.\"",

Therapy usually doensn’t work for two reasons.  \n\nThe first is that the client wasn’t ready to do the work required for change or had unrealistic expectations of therapy, usually believing the therapist has a magical quick fix solution. Something that is often said by therapists is that when clients first come to therapy, they only present with and share symptoms of much deeper issues.  This is something that may cause poor outcomes because the client is unwilling to explore the depth of their problems.\n\n  \nThe second reason is sometimes the therapist is simply not the right fit.  You can parallel this with a hairdresser.  If you go to the hairdresser for the first time and don’t like the cut, you may not return. However, that doesn’t mean you never get your haircut again.  Similarly, sometimes it comes down to finding the therapist that is the right fit.\n\n  \n",

Helps with being a bit more present in the body, sometimes I use that to reassure myself\n\nThe idea of \"worshiping\" was a way for me to respect myself and my needs more. Maybe you could find your ways around small gestures of selfcare (small enough so you can add them to your routine without it being a sudden change) ? \n\nShifting the way we see/understand/feel/think about the things around us (or inside us) is a great exercise and can do wonders.\n\nGetting help from professionals would be really great even though it is exhausting to find the right therapist. \n\nPlease OP don't be too harsh on yourself.

It feels like I’m trying to create the perfect starting point before I begin but that perfect moment smh never comes. It’s starting to bother me personally too because I feel like I’m constantly busy but not moving forward and that really hits self-confidence after a while like I used to think I was efficient and now I just feel scattered. Has anyone broken out of this preparation productivity loop? and if yes then howw and what actually worked for you?",

Doing the actual work means risking a bad draft or a messy outcome.\n\nWhat helped was separating “system time” from “work time.” I gave myself 20 minutes max to plan, then I had to pick one task and work on it for 30 minutes no matter how imperfect the setup felt. No tweaking allowed during that block.\n\nI also reduced my daily plan to just one “must move” task. Not a full list. Just the one thing that, if progressed, makes the day count. Everything else became optional.\n\nIt felt uncomfortable at first because the system wasn’t polished. But I realized I was polishing the container instead of filling it. Progress improved once I accepted that the starting point will almost always feel slightly messy.",

          "text": "This is more common than people admit.\n\nWhat you are describing is not laziness. It is “productive procrastination.” Planning feels safe. It feels in control. It gives a small dopamine hit without the emotional risk of actually starting.\n\nThe trap is this: preparation has no natural finish line. You can always refine the system one more time.\n\nHere are a few things that actually break the loop:\n\n1. Cap planning time aggressively Give yourself 10 to 15 minutes max to plan. Set a timer. When it rings, you must start the first task, even if the plan feels imperfect. Constraints create action.\n2. Define a “messy first action” Instead of preparing to work, start badly on purpose. Open the document and write a rough paragraph. Solve one tiny piece. Send the imperfect draft. Momentum kills overplanning.\n3. Separate planning days from execution blocks Have one weekly reset where you reorganize everything. Outside of that, you are not allowed to redesign the system. You only execute.\n4. Replace “optimize” with “ship” Ask yourself: what can I finish in the next 30 minutes that would move this forward? Not improve the structure. Not refine the workflow. Finish.\n5. Track output, not organization At the end of the day, measure visible results. Pages written. Problems solved. Emails sent. If it is not output, it does not count.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is this: clarity comes from action, not from better planning.\n\nIf this hit home, you would probably love 60-Second Productivity.\n\nIt is a weekly newsletter built for people who want to stop circling productivity and actually experience it. Each week you get one actionable tip you can apply immediately, no long reads, no theory spirals.\n\nIf you are tired of preparing to start and ready to actually move, subscribe here: [https://60secondproductivity.substack.com/](https://60secondproductivity.substack.com/)\n\nOne minute a week.

You fall to the level of your systems.\"\n\nIf that is not true for you, the level of your systems is to high.  \nLike today, I did not sleep well, because of emotions, so I already missed my morning routine. But I still put on at least one FM session and at least sorted through some papers. So instead of doing nothing I showed up and did a little bit.\n\nSo, you should rethink your systems and build them to handle emergencies.\n\nHope this helps!",

          "text": "don't just have goals, have minimums. like say your goal is to do 3 30 minute runs each week. maybe your minimum is 2 10 minute runs. \n\nalso as you live ask yourself, how much chaos does this add to my life? most people just pile it on until they break. think about how couples who have twins have a higher divorce rate--shouldn't be anything wrong with having twins but it's double the potential chaotic problems of a single baby, sometimes more because now one baby crying might wake up the other. the added stress causes something important to these people to break down because they had more chaos than they bargained for. and with twins that is one of the things that just happens sometimes. but you can also ask yourself, if i have no pets, how many random vet bills will i be getting if i get one? and if i have one pet and can handle it just fine, what about another? each one is a gamble. one pet might need nothing other than some food, a bed, and some toys, and the next one might need constant vet bills... maybe not even a problematic amount for you, but these problems won't care about their timing.\n\nalso learn to find your productivity to not just be a grind but relaxing. there might be some parts that are always work to you. but let's say you're an illustrator building a portfolio. some days you want to fully lock in, organize, design. but other days you might be completely drained. you can still get a pad and sketch while watching comfort movies.\n\nalso be willing to accept imperfect conditions, subpar tools. if you want to write every day, some days that will mean you get a coffee on a sunny walk through nature, feel inspired, and juuuust as you get home it starts to rain just like your moody gothic horror novel you're working on and it feels perfect and you wish every writing session could go like that. other days you might have to write on your phone while you're in line at the passport office while a baby is crying near you.\n\nBUT those days when everything sucks and you STILL do SOMETHING are so key. THEY are what tell you you mean business. When you want to go for a run and the weather is truly insurmountably terrible so you move some furniture around to give you space to do some calisthenics at home, THAT is how you know you can actually hit your goals. Let it be EXCITING to have to make things work and have your momentum challenged because when you push back just a little to keep moving forward, that little means a lot.\n\nalso try not to have systems that see one small failure as a complete failure. people who ascribe to streaks really have this problem--they feel great doing something for a week, 30 days, fifty days. then they miss ONE and instead of saying wow i have been hitting my target 98% of the time they go oh noooo my streak has ENDED! it's all over! give yourself some grace to miss some steps. \n\nalso when you fail: analyze. react. what can you do to prevent yourself from failing for the same reason again? learn from your mistake and think of it as a lesson, a strengthening, rather than a failure. \n\nalso: don't let your productivity systems ADD stress and more work. when you got to track and check a ton of stuff that interferes with just doing what you need to do. simplify your system to just one interface like one calendar app or a physical calendar or whatever works best for you.\n\nalso be willing to just admit you don't have the time or energy for certain goals right now and cut them--not in a sad way but a freeing way. don't let your number 7 life goal get in the way of your number 1-3 goals. \n\nplan for chaos. it's easy to set a bunch of goals and start acting on them when everything's good. we feel like we can become a Renaissance Man in January when there's nothing going on and we set these goals we want to do all year. then spring and summer hits and there's social obligations creeping up, maybe we are outdoors more and get injured, we socialize more so we get sick more, there's weddings, birthdays, etc. should we all feel like failures because we can't do in one hour of free time what we used to do when we had five hours a day free? no.\n\nso, don't be afraid to be 'greedy' when you DO have the time and energy. but think of those as bonus goals. maybe you CAN get into woodworking this year.... but that doesn't mean you'll do it every day. maybe you'll do it every day until the first day of spring, then it will be sunday mornings until October when you begin working on Christmas presents sunday mornings and wednesday evenings. \n\nAnd you still might need to be adaptable from there. But the point is your plan accounts for 'predictable chaos' and it is not a failure to reduce your output during these times because that is part of the plan.\n\nif we want to be extra from here we could do something kind of like sick days at work. We get twenty 'skip it' days per year but you have to physically track them to make it feel harder to cheat, like putting beads into a jar. Whether you intend to miss a day, or do it unintentionally, you MUST put a bead into the jar. something like this will help us really think: is my life actually chaotic and low-energy enough right now, or can I power through and save this \"sick day\" for something worse?",

I was waking up motivated one day, but life got in the way the next, so every time it felt like I was starting over again.\n\nWhat actually helped me get back on track was to create a (rather sophisticated) system where my to-do list is completely dynamic and changes based on importance and overdue score. For example, if I can't do the dishes today, it's not the end of the world, that action stays on my list and is there as soon as I have the time for it again, but other actions are allowed take precedence in an intelligent way: if my \"5-minute Tabata\" action becomes overdue, that automatically takes precedence in my list, because I've set it as more important than doing the dishes. After doing my 5-minutes of exercise, I still get a chance to do the dishes.\n\nThe setup might sound complicated, but it's really not. I now have over 50 recurring actions that are automatically being prioritized, so it's easy to get back on track when \"life happens\". I might not be able to score 100% every day, but 90% is pretty damn achievable with this kind of clarity. And to think that I could have \"juggled\" 50 recurring actions with random schedules (some daily, some monthly and some at strange intervals, like 8 hours) consistently, without such a system, would be completely naive. Having it in place almost feels like cheating at times. It's my hidden superpower.\n\nThe system I'm talking about is Forjd and I've made it available online. Look it up if you're interested, it's quite fun and it almost plays like a game :)",

All of a sudden I kept uncontrollably procrastinating and putting off work to doomscroll or watch tv. \n\nI struggled with procrastinating previously, but it had never been such a consistent and persistent issue to the point where it felt like I couldn’t overcome it.  This went on for basically the entirety of 2025. I’m trying to improve things and have done a bit better but there’s still an underlying problem that I just realized. I’m not sure how accurate this is, but it almost feels like someone swapped out the brain I’ve had all my life, for another one that has ADHD. \n\nI have all these goals and ambitions and I need to remain productive but then I just find myself fighting the urge to do literally anything else but the task at hand. It’s making me feel hopeless and really scared about how I am going to handle my life and responsibilities. I don’t want to throw away everything I’m working towards.\n\nI’ve never had this issue with being unable to focus before and have always been focused on remaining productive and was doing well at it.\n\nI don’t believe it’s me being burnt out because I wasn’t necessarily working myself to the bone before it happened.

Even if you weren't \"burnt out\" from work, you can be \"burnt out\" from stimulation.\n\nYour baseline dopamine is too low to \"start\" boring tasks, so try out 24 hours of zero digital input.  \nThen delete the doomscroll apps and use the web versions. They have a simpler design without so many triggers. (At least for a while to reset).  \nHigh-arousal content has re-wired your \"interest\" threshold. Practice doing nothing for 10 mins a day. (And this is hard tbh, but can be the best thing to help)\n\nFocus is a muscle that has atrophied because you stopped lifting \"heavy\" (deep, slow work) and started lifting \"air\" (quick, easy content).

It really does feel like your brain got swapped overnight and none of the old tricks work anymore.\n\nOne thing that helped was realising this doesn’t always mean ADHD out of nowhere. A lot of people hit a point where their brain just stops responding to pressure the way it used to. Stress, uncertainty, phone dopamine, life changes, all stack quietly. You don’t have to be worked to death to break your focus, sometimes it’s just too much low level noise for too long.\n\nWhat made it worse for me was fighting it constantly. Every day felt like a test I was failing. What helped a bit was switching from trying to focus, to trying to reduce resistance. Tiny starts. Five minutes. Open the doc, don’t write. Sit there. If nothing happens, fine. Weirdly that brought some control back.\n\nAlso doomscrolling isn’t laziness, it’s avoidance. Usually from fear of messing up something you actually care about.\n\nYou’re not broken and you’re not throwing your life away. You’re just in a phase where brute force stopped working, and that’s unsettling as hell.\n\nI write about this stuff from a normal perspective because I hit the same wall and most advice felt useless.

      "text": "*\"I can't focus during lectures anymore\"*\n\n*\"Why is studying so hard now?\"*\n\n*\"I used to be a good student but can't concentrate for even 20 minutes\"*\n\nMany students are genuinely confused. They're following the typical study methods (in some cases, methods they've used for a long time), but finding it harder and harder to retain information, sit through a lecture without mentally drifting, or read more than a page without reaching for their phone.\n\nWhat students are experiencing is born out in the data. Dr. Gloria Mark's research tracked our declining attention spans:\n\nThe average college student now checks social media 118 times per day.\n\nBut the problem's rooted in something deeper than just your study sessions. Count how many things you're doing simultaneously throughout they day:\n\n* Walking to class while responding to texts\n* Eating while watching Shorts\n* Studying with friends while everyone scrolls phones\n* Listening to lectures while browsing different Reddit subs\n\nIf you're struggling to focus in class or while studying, I'm willing to bet almost **all** of your day is filled with this type of rapid multitasking and context switching. (It's really about the context-switching: the rapid and constant jumping from screen to screen, tab to tab, app to app, swipe to swipe.)\n\nBecause every moment you're switching contexts, you're training your brain to need constant stimulation. Your neural pathways literally rewire to reject sustained focus.\n\nSome call this 'popcorn brain' — your mind constantly jumping from thought to thought, unable to settle on any single task. Like kernels popping erratically in every direction, your attention bounces around without control.\n\nThen you try to read a textbook chapter and your brain physically rebels, because you've spent the other 15 hours of your day training it to do the exact opposite. And you wonder why you can't focus when you need to.\n\nThe fix is simple but not easy: Single-task throughout your day as much as possible, not just during study time. Read without music. Walk without podcasts. Eat without screens. One tab open for assignments.\n\nYes, it feels uncomfortable. Your brain will crave stimulation. That discomfort means you're rebuilding your attention span.\n\nMost study advice focuses on those 2-3 hours of dedicated study time. But if the rest of your day trains your brain for fractured attention and constant novel stimulation, you're fighting a losing battle.",

In a 50 min lecture, I could never stay focused for more than 20 min before my brain needed to know how much time was left before I could escape the room.

I planned on cutting it off as its was feeding so much negativity to my head and add something else to fill that time. \n\nI wrap work around 7 PM and have dinner by 8 PM. I have about 7-8 hours after this for myself as I usually sleep late around 3-4 AM. My goal is to get to a point where I sleep by 12-1 at max, a topic for another day!\n\nI intended to use that time to upskill/work on side projects. My concern was that even with this 7-8 hours, I will be able to study for 2-3 hours at max as cognitive fatigue is real after work and few hours of study. I had no idea how was gonna fill the remaining \\~4 hours\n\n**How it turned out?**  \nOne week into this and the effects are massive. Surprisingly, negative too!!\n\n* I’ve been able to redcuce doom scrolling over the past week (Reddit, Twitter, etc) by \\~70–80%\n* I’m putting a few hours into studying after work. The issue is what comes after, once mental energy is depleted, anything cognitively demanding feels unrealistic so no space to dive into any hobby that is remotely demanding cognitively\n* **Loneliness kicked in** \\- Honestly, I didn't anticipate this to happen but in hindsight now I realize that  scrolling might be keeping my head occupied and making me avoid feeling lonely. I wasn't feeling like this before I started with this exercise a week back. The last \\~4h block that I refereed earlier is where I feel lonely which feels like a serious negative side effect of this at this point\n* Having said that, I’m optimistic this is temporary friction of me tapering myself down from doom scrolling. \n* Over the next few weeks, I plan to explore low effort, lighter activities that help unwind without reverting to doom scrolling or forcing productivity.\n\n\n\nCurious if others have experienced something similar and what helped?",

For you, that’s loneliness. A lot of people hit this phase and think something went wrong. It didn’t. You just took away a coping mechanism faster than you added a replacement.\n\nThat empty 3–4 hour block isn’t supposed to be productive. Treating it like it should be filled is what makes it heavier. After work + studying, your brain is done. That time is for low-stakes, low-pressure stuff. Loneliness doesn’t mean you need more people immediately. Sometimes it just means you need more presence. Things like walking outside with music, cooking slowly, journaling badly, watching one comfort show instead of endless clips. Stuff that keeps you company without frying your brain.\n\nAlso, some social input helps. Not deep conversations every night, just light human noise. A call with a friend once or twice a week, a gym class, Discord voice chat, even sitting in a café. Scrolling gave fake connection. You removed it, so your nervous system is like “hey, where did everyone go?” One important thing: don’t panic and reinstall doom scrolling to fix the loneliness. Sit with it a bit. This phase usually passes once your brain recalibrates and you build gentler evening rituals. You’re not regressing. This is what progress feels like when it’s not anesthetized.",

With a vague task (project in my comment) I just cannot see the start of the path, it is covered by thick vegetation or low cloud = no way into the project.\n\nI find that I ignore the start of such tasks or projects and seek out some simple task related to the area of the project that may or may not end up being wholly relevent. Such as document review around the project area. It might not go into the finished output of the project but it is something I can actually start and do. I find doing something simple around the project always leads to finding the start of the path to the end.\n\nThere is a term for this I think but I cannot recall. It is about feeling like you are doing something and freeing the mind on the task by doing not thinking so hard. I think vague tasks or projects (without scope adequately defined) leads to procrastination by overthinking it. A simple, even five or ten minute work close to the task area stops this and I end up moving more into the task or project with momentum.\n\nIn summary I notice this pattern too. I think for me vagueness comes partly from it not being defined in the scope, but also if it feels like you need to carry out some threshold task to define it. Such as needing to contact someone new or senior in the area the work is related to without a clear ask in order to find the information to define the task clearly. That is with me at least since I do not like seeking help or making new contacts (introverted perhaps) and an overly respectful attitude towards those much higher up the food chain than I!! Too busy to deal with me surely. An issue I have worked on a lot more over the last year or so.",
