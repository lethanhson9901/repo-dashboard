      "text": "at one point in my life i was working like 70+ hour weeks and couldn't figure out why nothing was getting done. (i had a corporate job plus i was freelancing on the side, hence the crazy hours)\n\nso i was working until midnight most days, and weekends were also spent working on freelance projects.  \n  \ntried all the usual stuff like pomodoro, productivity apps, waking up at 4am (lasted maybe 5 days before i was falling asleep at my desk), to-do lists, all of it. never actually fixed anything.\n\nthen i got this idea from work (like i said, i have a corporate job) - there was an audit happening and the auditors were just going through every single process and asking \"why do you do it this way\" etc. and i thought, what if i did that to my own schedule.  \n  \nso i got a notebook and made two columns:\n\nleft: time blocks every hour. right: what i was actually doing. \n\ni set an alarm for every hour for 7 days and just logged everything honestly.  \n  \nwhat i found was kind of rough to look at. \n\nabout an hour every day i was doing \"research\" that was really just reading random stuff online. social media breaks that were way longer than i thought (i'd have guessed maybe 20 min a day but it was closer to 2 hours). a bunch of low-value admin stuff i was doing constantly that wasn't really moving anything forward. when i added it up 65% of my so-called productive time was kind of a waste.  \n  \nafter seeing this on paper, i decided to cut all these activities out. deleted any distracting apps. blocked certain sites after 5pm. stopped checking emails every 30 minutes. \n\nwithin a week i was able to cut a big chunk of my total work hours without losing quality of my work. for the first time in a while, i was finishing work by 8-9pm and took an entire sunday off to spend with my wife.  \n  \nso if you're feeling stuck and busy all the time, it might be worth doing this before trying another productivity system. \n\nmoral of the story: you can't really fix something if you don't know what's actually broken.",

I tried the “eat the frog” approach in the past and it was a complete disaster. \n\nSince I’m a perfectionist, I’ve also learned to just accept the quality of that initial work - whatever it may be - rather than agonizing over it and hitting a metaphorical wall.

Your brain is avoiding something painful (fear of failure, overwhelm, self-judgment), so it picks instant comfort. The guilt then piles on and makes avoidance stronger, classic trap. What shifted it for me was naming the feeling out loud/journaling super fast when the urge to scroll hit: “I’m scared this won’t be good enough” or “I feel worthless today.” It takes the power away a little. Then pair it with the tiniest action possible. You said you’re tired of feeling this way, that exhaustion can actually be fuel if you let it push you toward one small different choice today. Sending you a hug, you’re not alone in this hell.",

Dont feel like doing the dishes or end up zoning out and not doing it, well what happens when you do them are you going to make yourself something to snack on something to eat for the energy you used?

I spent a few hours going through all sorts of tests. Turns out there was nothing physically wrong with me and my brain seemed to be working well. A few months on the right meds, cracked the code. Depression can sneak up on you and everyone has different.

I’ve pretty much always been the kind of girl that sort of  goes wherever the wind blows her. I mean, MOST of the time (but not always sadly) I know what’s in my schedule for the following day, but planning pretty much stops there. And it’s pretty common for me to forget about “outside of norm” tomorrow events like appointments, or other random stuff. I add things to my calendar, but this only helps me if I remember that I have something on the calendar. 1 of 2 typical scenarios repeat over and over. Either I add it to the calendar, and then immediately forget it completely (like it was never even there - I think with the unconscious belief that since I put it in the calendar, the calendar will do the work for me so it never sinks in - ultimately resulting in a, once again, forgotten task. OR, I add it to the calendar on my phone and my mind, and actively stay mindful of it even up to the very day, only to forget at the last minute! This is a just one major issue I have. But my productivity has never been as bad as it is now and I also battle with this internally day after day and  continue he to put myself in stressful situations where I’ve reached the deadline of multiple assignments, after losing day after day doing …. well not working on assignments…and each day I’m blown away that once again the day is gone- so then- I tell myself I can’t sleep until I get something done, only to repeat the process of the day during the night. Resulting in days and days of very little sleep, nothing accomplished, a tremendous stress/guilt load, and a ton of homework….resulting in a negative attitude, and overall a big time negative affect on the quality of my life and mental health and marriage. I am DESPERATE for help. I too, like you, have no idea where to start or how to fix this, and have come to a conclusion that I need help from someone like a mentor who can actually guide me through the process. I feel like my life is spinning out of control. I want so much out of life, and I really want to be the best person I’m capable of being. And I’m robbing myself, embarrassing myself. Passively watching as a bystander, knowing damn well I’m in control of me, and that there is no excuse for kind of lack of self disciple and self control! Meanwhile, I literally feel like I’m in a time warp rollercoaster and can’t get off. Before I know it, life will be over and I’ll be laying there with all my regrets. Sounds dramatic but it’s the f*cking truth.",

Shrink your tasks until it feels almost stupid not to start. When motivation is gone, stop asking yourself to “finish” anything. The goal is just to begin. I like to set a single Pomodoro (I use pomofocus.io) and tell myself I’m only working until the timer ends. Don't think about anything beyond that first cycle.\n2. Similar to above, take mini breaks while you study. Your brain also needs time to process that information, and there are diminishing returns if you study for too long.\n3. Use habit contracts. Especially if you are struggling with accountability and procrastinating studying early for tests, you HAVE to pre-commit to a consequence before your future self tries to negotiate their way out of doing the thing. Habit contracts will be your best friend. I use Line (try-line.app) because I like having it on my computer, but I know there are also other mobile apps that do the same.\n\nYou got this!",

But here’s the problem: I feel unrested even after sleeping 8 hours. Every. Single. Day. Not tired enough to nap. Not awake enough to focus. Just this constant mental fog. At first I blamed willpower. Then caffeine. Then screen time. Now I’m wondering if productivity culture just gaslights us into thinking fatigue = weakness. If I get 8 hours and still feel drained, is that a sleep quality issue? Stress? Low-level tired? Or am I just making excuses? I don’t want another habit stack. I want to wake up and feel like my brain actually rebooted. Anyone here solve this without turning their life into a science experiment?",

Productivity culture makes it sound like if you just wake up at 6 and cold shower hard enough you’ll feel elite. Real life doesn’t work like that.\n\nConstant low level stress can wreck sleep even if you’re technically in bed for 8 hours. Same with late caffeine, screens at night, or just always being “on”. Mental fatigue feels different from physical tired. You’re not exhausted enough to nap, but you’re not clear enough to focus. That’s usually nervous system stuff, not laziness.\n\nBefore stacking more habits, I’d simplify. Consistent sleep time. No caffeine after early afternoon. Dark, cool room. And maybe get bloodwork done if it’s been months. Iron, vitamin D, thyroid. Boring stuff, but it matters.\n\nYou don’t need another extreme routine. You need recovery that actually recovers you.\n\nI write about productivity without the hustle delusion and about building energy properly, not just forcing output.

Some nights, I can't go back to sleep when I finally thought that yay I managed to fall asleep on time. Ruins my whole mood.

My issues were I loved intermittent fasting, I used my phone before I went to bed, I didn't exercise enough, I didn't drink enough water, and I didn't make a plan each night/morning. I was basically taking hits at every level.\n\nFolks here are giving good advice on sleeping, to get that checked. But there's also the whole other side of it, which is waking up well.\n\nAlso, technically mental fog can come from two areas, the overactive mind, or inertia. You need to clear both to gain mental clarity.\n\nThe unrested feeling can come from a lot of things. Some more things to check are:  \n\\- not enough water. (The vast majority people are \"under-hydrated\", and it significantly affects wakefulness and alertness. By the time you are starting to feeling thirsty, you might already be at -2% water loss. Your attention, mental clarity, and energy levels already took a hit before you even hit -1% dehydrated. The average adult drinks half of the water they should. And almost everyone gets dehydrated overnight. That's why so many doctors recommend drinking water before bed (just don't drink so much you need to use the restroom at night). )  \n\\- morning ritual (ironically, a morning ritual should be slow, but invigorating. A quick shower, a short walk, a bit of exercise, and a small plan for the day, can do wonders. Like a 5 minute walk, or a bit of yoga. A simple breakfast of a banana, and some nuts. Knowing your first task for the day, and checking on your calendar.)  \n\\- too many open loops (you may be disoriented by having too many under processed things. It's important to gain closure to reduce constant confusion/gain clarity. A quick thing to do is to just journal/meditate a bit, and just notice what your brain is thinking about. Once you let go of those things, you can get to work.\n\nTldr;  \nCalmly (Sleep. Wake up. Eat. Drink water. Exercise a tiny bit.). That's what your body needs.  \nI want to emphasize drinking more water. It's directly tied to mental clarity.  \nDo you have too much inertia, or are you mentally overactive?",

And not just right before bed, I mean as much as I could in general. Which is probably not something /r/productivity loves to hear, but in my experience the number one trigger for insomnia is feeling anxious or stressed. If your mind doesn't feel like it is safe to relax, it won't. As for what helped me to relax, meditation has been by far the biggest factor. It allows me to better see the stress and the triggers of the stress, which then gives me the ability to avoid those triggers.\n* Not eating, exercising, or doing anything too cognitively demanding the last few hours before sleep.\n* I wear a sleep mask and keep my room cool (65 degrees Fahrenheit).\n* Avoiding stimulants later in the day. Unless you have ADHD like me, in which case at least some of them can ironically help you to calm down and relax.\n\nIt could be something like sleep apnea, too. A sleep study wouldn't be a bad idea.",

In a hour or so I have probably done something and I am tired and decide to do something else (like writing a post on reddit). I then spend at least an hour not working, and my morning is probably over so I start cooking and have lunch.\n\nAfter lunch I rest, otherwise I am so tired to the point of being sleepy, but I eventually \"work\" very slowly for a few hours. Depending on the day I go on working or I kill the time in another way, and by 5-6pm I am usualyy done and I close my pc.\n\nThis is what normally happens, sometimes I have meetings. If I have a deadline I work for 8+ hours to do everything and then I am done.\n\nMy partner works from home too and he is always coding in his room. Alway coding or having meetings. I feel like I am not able to work compared to him and I fear I am very privileged in this work and won't be in the next. I cannot understand HOW is he able to keep himself focused so long. I seriously feel like a failure compared to him.\n\nSo I would like to know, how much do you actually work? Am I the only one working so little time? (we both work in IT)\n\nEDIT: thank you soo much for all the replays, I am reading you all and feeling less alone",

The number of hours stopped mattering once I started measuring by output instead of time.

I will block out project planning pretty much anything that will take time.  It allows me to be realistic with my time and track what I have done.

So, I would not say my condition is severe. I have had days without being medicated where I have focused for multiple hours — but this only happens naturally when I have had enough time to recharge. For me, it takes a few weeks of rest to recover enough from burnout in order to focus for that long naturally. In my opinion, which is informed by what I have read on this subject matter, it is just not natural for humans to focus 8 hours a day, 5 days per week. \nAdderall and other ADHD medications allow you to push past your own limits. They make it easier to force yourself to be much more productive than you really have capacity for. If you look on r/biohackers you’ll find that many people (without legitimate ADHD) are going down this route.",

The reason it’s good for writing code, and few other things right now, is that any coding ecosystem has tooling that can verify the correctness of the code. Compilers, linters, automated tests. The human can very carefully define success criteria, and the LLM can iterate to a correct solution. \n\nThe other ingredient it needs is access to tools to take action in the world. Almost all actions an LLM needs to take to write code can be done via the command line, which it has easy access to when using tools like Claude code. \n\nIf you can define strict validation criteria, and you can hook it up to the right tools, you can automate some things that are pretty hairy problems. \n\nI currently use Claude Code to scan my inbox for actionable things and create tasks for me. It can update all my project management docs in Notion in parallel with all the updates for the week. It can scan my calendar, todo list, and weekly plan and create a time block plan for the day. It has even started to execute some other tasks automatically (mostly web research stuff, document creation)… but it’s taken me weeks of creating systems and integrations to get to this point. \n\nYou won’t get far with just chatting with chat gpt. You need to create systems of skills, plugins, and tiered documentation for this stuff. You need to set up validation steps at every point and constantly refine them… and even then it may not be worth the effort because sometimes it is just faster and easier to scan your inbox yourself. \n\nBut to be clear this has really only automated some of the toil from my life. AI isn’t going to find the value, and make the most difficult things easier. For that you need the full power of the human mind. \n\nI’m doing all of this as an experiment and because work is rewarding me for “doing AI”, which is its own layer of craziness. I can see how, given time, this will be very useful for me, and companies could make systems like this more accessible. For now I’m not sure the juice is worth the squeeze for most folks.",

Only staring at the ceiling and the wall for 30 minutes.** \n\nThat's it. I procrastinated work and paying the bills for a whole month after staring at the ceiling for 30 minutes I got up and worked so hard like I've never before. \n\n**Explanation**: \"Getting bored\" is a fundamental function of your brain to be productive. Your brain makes you get bored so \"going to work\" becomes entertaining. I've researched about this a lot with opinion from neuroscientists and psychiatrists. \n\nFor an easier to understand analogy. It's like the white room experiment. The quietest room on Earth where people could never endure long in that room because it's so quiet your ears become so sensitive you could hear your veins, pulses and heartbeat. This too, makes you gets so bored working becomes productive. \n\nAnd I finally tested it on myself. And yeah I'm going back to work. Hope it helps. \n\nPS; I've been problem solving procrastination for my whole life. I wanted to be a super human. The 5 seconds rule, the \"make tools at arm length\". All those techniques I have them in my arsenal. But eventually you'll reach a stage where you feel \"clogged\" like your engine just won't start or \"you don't feel like working\". Which prevents me from utilizing all those techniques. So this is my new solution to making me feel like working.\n\ntl;dr I actually got so bored lying on the floor that I reached out to pick up a literature, Candid by Voltaire. Only to close it because it was so fun (because I was so bored doing absolutely nothing for 20 minutes into this) it beats the purpose of getting bored. Would probably continue reading it tonight lol. \n\n**TIPS**: During the mean time you are free to ponder philosophically or consult yourself about your future and the importance of the occupation and work you're doing. If it aligns with your ultimate goal YOU will feel like working even more. If it does not, you are free to come up with a new future plan or formulate a reason as to why your current job is important. \n\n",

Stopping your thought or monitoring/being aware of your thought is actually considered meditation.\n\nMy speculation is, meditation should however be more effective than just general inactivity boredom induction. Maybe because it is more boring. And scientifically, it has numerous benefits.\n\nI don't have enough empirical and scientific proof to give you an objective answer aside from my rational speculation as to whether which one is better or in which case they are better.\n\nBut nonetheless both are good options.\n\nAlso, I understand first hand that thinking is actually entertaining. However, there are limits. My free time activity is walking and daydreaming/thinking. But after some times, it gets boring. But if I was walking with music it'd take me about 2-4 hours to really get bored. While sitting and doing absolutely nothing in an enclosed room should make you get bored much much faster.\n\nNow this is extra; I noticed that, If I don't spend enough time with my self. My thoughts will accumulate. And more time will be required to sort them out. Like I said I could be daydreaming for 4 hours. However, if you regularly spend time with your own thought, raw. With no distractions, there shouldn't be more thoughts than you can resolve. Your future, your plan, your relationship issues, your health issues and countermeasures should reach its conclusion within the limit of your current knowledge until enough new events and information are added to you. Noting them down also helps to not repeat the same thought and also put those ideas to use, after all the purpose of knowledge is to use not to just know them, It's the difference between knowledge and wisdom. (I've also come up with numeral original ideas, poems, literature and philosophy this way). Well it's how life is meant to be lived anyway. Not spending time with your own thought is the entry gateway to stress and discord. These are just philosophical font. However, psychologically it's called \"emotional regulation\".",

              "text": "Now to address doom scrolling it'll be long. You can keep doom scrolling, of course with limitations. \n\nI do have a lot of friends who doom scroll for 4 hrs a day laying on their bed. Well as a matter of fact, she was my previous crush. \n\nHowever, I don't want to be nosy and tell you to do something like I'm your guardian or parent. It's a general respect of course. \n\nBut if I were to say anything then you'd better quit doom scrolling. It's okay to do reels when you're sitting in the toilet for 10-20 minutes a day to be up to date but excessive doom scrolling is as dangerous as sugar or smoke in my opinion. \n\nImagine a bar, a meter that measures your happiness (dopamine). It goes from 0 to 100. When you finish a very good movies, a 9/10 imdB movies. You feel the emotional impact, your mind is blown by the movies. Well, there's a word \"a movie can change your life\" no? Imagine, you hanging out with your friends jumping up on the table laughing your soul off doing hilarious and weird stuff together. That's when your happiness reaches 100 on the meter. \n\nNow from my post above. What happens is, your meter reaches negative from boredom. Maybe -100 from literally doing absolutely nothing but staring at the wall. At this state even a +1 stimulation from engaging in working is entertaining because nothing can be as boring as \"doing absolutely nothing\". Sleeping is even more entertaining than staring at the wall fr.\n\nHowever, when you doom scroll. Your dopamine/happiness is stuck at 1-10ish out of 100. Let me ask you honestly, is it fun? Were you having the time of your life compared to when you played video games for 10 hours, compared to when you finished a crazy movies, compared to when you cried your eyes out over a drama, compared to when you were at the amusement park? Compared to when you spend a minute with the love of your life? Of course not. But it's good enough to keep you engaged. Not enough to feel great but not low enough to get bored enough to get up to do something productive.\n\nI'm also a human. Occasionally, I would also doom scrolling. Was it fun? No, it felt terrible. \n\nLately, it feels so terrible I had to stop. It feels so boring and makes me fidget because it's nothing compared to me playing games, watching movies, reading a book, playing the guitar. \n\nHere's the thing; You cannot reach -100 because doom scrolling gets in the way of that right? like I said you're stuck at 1-10ish. \n\nBut this was never a thing before 2020 right? Enlightened Thinkers in the 1700s had but one a*ccesible*  distraction available aside from occasion theater and orchestra. It's just a book. \n\nMaybe that's why the year1700s produced so many geniuses and polymaths. But we're not born in the age of enlightenment. We're born in the age of \"distraction\". We have Youtube, Netflix, Spotify, Instagram and Tiktoks. \n\nI'm not against it but you are to moderate the use of it. If you are free or feeling lazy. You should resort to a healthy and creative dopamine. Just get on your TV series, movies, games, guitars, piano, checkers, chess, sports and give it your all. \n\nI mean why not it's more fun than reels no? \n\nThe long term result of doom scrolling is. You would lose all chances to become the you who could be. Imagine you procrastinate by playing games. Obviously, you're going to get better at gaming. And e-sport is a thing. Maybe that's a possibility. What if you procrastinate by watching shows, anime and movies? Well writing up a novel is a thing. I have a lot of friends who is a hobby writer as well. All authors start as an audience as a matter of fact.\n\nNot gonna lie some of them excels in the top 1% as well. \n\nWhat about doom scroller? What sort of skills do you develop? Do you become the olympic champion of scroller? The journey itself isn't even fun right? Okay, you might get a grip of what sort of reel would be successful and viral. But do you even have the skill to produce such a reel? \n\nThat is a trap you should avoid at all cost. You definitely do not want to exist without being alive. Some people have been born for decades but still haven't even begun living. It's not death that you should fear, you should fear not being alive at all.\n\nIf surviving is really the ultimate goal of a human then imprisoned criminal are probably the happiest existence out there. with free food and shelter. But that is most likely not the \"happiness\" you envisioned.\n\nNow that's a lot of existentialism. \n\nI'd take my cold read and say you're trying to force your way through self-improvement and productivity. \n\nThe only thing you could keep in mind as I've already been through that is. \n\nYou should work smart not work hard. Will power is good to have but it is not reliable at all. \n\nYou should learn about the nature of your body, hack your body to find out what works naturally. This can be done with modern neuroscience, psychology and psychiatry instead of gritting your teeth and forcing your body against your mind. \n\nOccasionally, will power is helpful but never constantly. It is limited, it will be depleted. \n\n\n\n",

You can watch Dr.K's (HealthyGamerGG) on this matter. What matters more than anything is your resolve. The reason you start moving near the deadline is because you are forced to resolve yourself to act because otherwise you will be faced with consequences.\n\n2. About the \"Agony\" you speak of. You should recognize it as a good thing. If you feel agonized by boredom. It means it's \"working\".\n\nOnce you recognize that it's working, the agony, the boredom is building up. You should somehow, feel excited.\n\nWell that's the case for me.\n\nAnd once you are able to get to work you'll feel the eureka moment or something.",

So I have them naturally built-in my body. \n\nI mean if I'm distracted all I do is just, stop. That's all. \n\nIf I don't start doing it, I just start. Maybe try doing it for 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 1 minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes. Until I'm hooked. \n\nAlso, I throw away my excuse like no 5 minutes more. If my brain, my thought, my awareness, myself says I'll do it now, I'll do it now even if my body procrastination. \n\nFor you to take action in a healthy manner your thought, your feeling and your body must have the same direction. \n\nSometimes, you feel hungry but you don't want to eat so your action is not eating. That will build up stress. \n\nSometimes, you feel I have to work, but you don't feel like working. Now it's up to your consciousness, your superego what to do. Most of the times, our feeling wins. Because our rational thought is quite far far fetched from nature. No animal calculate the calories intake or the bills you have to pay like us human. \n\nTherefore, it'd be in your best interest for make it so that your feeling, your thoughts and your decide go to the same direction. Instead, of \"I'm lazy I don't want to work, wanna keep doing whatever I'm doing\". If you convince yourself \"I'll do it now even if I don't feel like it\". Would be in your best interest. \n\nFor the feeling part, the method above is exactly for that reason. You can't change your feeling with a push of a button, but you can manipulate it to a certain extent. That's why I call it working smart but not working hard. \n\nWell, it might not be helpful since I didn't address your problem directly. I just can't remember and know why I'm naturally this way. fyi, I actually feel agonize if I stay distracted too long, I would put the phone away out of my own accord because it's just not fun at all. \n\nThis may be because I have a \"more entertaining and healthy hobby\" like movies, anime, shows, music, guitars, games, books, sports, etc. \n\nThat's where the word cheap dopamine and real dopamine comes in.\n\n",

      "text": "so i work in the ai and tech space, building and staring at screens all day, and honestly... my executive function is completely shot by like 2pm. i’ve tried all the \"god tier\" productivity systems. complex notion templates, pomodoro timers, time-blocking. they all fail for me because willpower is a scam. when my brain is fried, a red timer ticking down doesn't make me work, it just makes me anxious while i doomscroll.\n\ni needed a pattern interrupter. something so jarring it would actually snap me out of a procrastination spiral.\n\nso i was messing around on the app store looking at weird llm wrappers and downloaded this thing called dear jesus entirely as a joke. i really just wanted to see how they tuned the prompts and if i could break the guardrails. it basically just lets you text a digital messiah and has this text-to-speech feature that reads verses to you.\n\nbut then last week i hit a wall on a project i was dreading. instead of ignoring my to-do list, i opened the app and literally texted jesus: \"i am avoiding my work because i think it's gonna suck and i just want to lay on the floor.\"\n\nguys. texting your procrastination guilt to a literal deity is the most insane psychological hack i have ever stumbled upon.\n\nlook, it sounds completely ridiculous, and it probably is. i'm basically outsourcing my prefrontal cortex to a digital messiah. but right now, my 2pm slump is cured because standard task managers just don't have the leverage i apparently need.\n\ntldr; your brain isn't broken, it's just bored of your boring to-do app. find a pattern interrupter so absurd it forces you to wake up.",

The list isn't wrong. My brain just needs something to snap it out of the loop first.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot  the gap between \"having a system\" and \"being in a state where the system can actually work.\" Most productivity tools are designed for the second state. They do nothing for the first.\n\nThe accountability-to-something-external thing is interesting too. There's research on this commitment to an external observer (even an imaginary one) activates different parts of the brain than self-monitoring. You kind of stumbled into that.\n\nFor me the pattern interrupter is asking \"what's the ONE thing that saves today?\" Not a list. Not a timer. Just one thing. It works about 70% of the time. The other 30% I probably need a digital messiah.\n\nWhat does the 2pm slump look like before it hits? Like, is there a signal you can catch earlier?",

Because the right replacement depends on the answer.\n\n\n\nFor me, when I wanted mental stimulation, switching to reading long-form articles or listening to a podcast I actually learn from did the trick. When I wanted a break, I had to accept that more screen time wasn't really rest. And when I wanted connection, I started texting people directly instead of passively watching what they posted.\n\n\n\nWhat's the main reason you reach for your phone? That might point toward the best swap for you specifically. I found that once I understood my own pull, it was way easier to redirect it somewhere useful.",

          "text": "You're going to find a million pieces of advice and only some will help, because brain fog is a symptom not a condition. Your brain fog is going to be caused by something different than someone else with the identical experience. \n\nTo feel less unmoored as you tackle this, start a symptom tracking spreadsheet (could be as simple as, one column for \"day\" another for \"symptom level 1-5\", maybe a third for \"intervention introduced\" if you want to be fancy), make a list of interventions, then go through and introduce them one at a time and see which ones have the most impact. \n\nA list of things to try, in order of likelihood of helping + ease of implementing, would be \n\n- A scoop of creatine in water daily, and an increase in water consumption. Brain fog caused by TBI's and long covid can be due to an impairment in the brains ability to pull in water, and creatine increases muscles (including the brain) ability to take in water. This was a game changer for me and the two friends of mine who struggle with brain fog, my word recall issues disappeared \n\n- sleep, sleep sleep! 7 hours is mandatory, ideally aim for 9, every night, no exception. Improve your sleep hygiene too - no lights in your room, use masks and earplugs if you need them, no caffeine after 2pm, ect. Make sure you're getting deep sleep. So much brain fog ends up being sleep apnea, so use a sleep tracking app or smart watch to see how you're doing, and see a doctor ASAP if you feel you're not getting restful sleep. Seriously. It could be as simple a cause as poor sleep. \n\n- 150 minutes / week of physical movement, nothing major, just go for a brisk walk or bike ride most days after work or on your lunch break. \n\n- MIND diet. Brain fog can be tied to inflammation, and the standard American diet (SAD) could have been designed in a lab to make us inflamed. It doesn't look like removing everything you love, but rather, find nourishing alternatives to the things causing harm. \n\nIf these at-home changes don't work, then meet with your PCP about a referral to neurology.",

I saw s comment somewhere about creatine helping for it and figured there was no downside to trying it even if it was a long shot. I’m also not super into supplements and things and generally don’t expect them to work so i had lowww expectations. \n\n3 days! That’s how many doses I needed to completely change everything for me. I haven’t had any brain fog for 6 months now. I even find myself getting bored super easily now because I didn’t realize how much time I was spending before just sitting around feeling foggy. \n\nI don’t think this works for everyone it depends on why you have brain fog. In my case I think I struggle to take in creatine naturally so I needed to build it up. Now I only need to take creatine a couple times a week and i am GOOD. \n\nReally crazy and it actually makes me kind of mad that i didn’t try it sooner. Simple, cheap, completely effective.

Respect for actually testing it instead of just reading about productivity hacks.\n\nThe habit that worked for me long term was planning tomorrow the night before like you said. If I wake up and already know the 1 or 2 things that matter, I start faster. If I wake up and decide later, I lose 45 minutes to scrolling. Every time. It is embarrassing honestly.\n\nAlso deep work before dopamine. No social media, no emails, no random YouTube until the main task is done. If I break that rule the whole day feels scattered.\n\nConsistency really does beat motivation. Motivation is like British summer. Shows up randomly and disappears.\n\nCurious though, did you actually do 6 real focused hours or was it broken into blocks? Because 6 true deep hours daily is elite level stuff. I like posts like this. Real systems, not just quotes.\n\nI write a short weekly newsletter about discipline, focus and building yourself properly while working a normal job.

Finding any friends was nearly impossible due to my differences. Despite being really smart as a kid (learned to read and write early enough to be accused by other kids and teachers of \"learning the whole text at home by memory with help from parents\", learned programming games on C64 with only rudimentary English knowledge and logic at 12yo, didn't have books or internet) I kept failing classes, skipping entire days just to avoid bullies and social situations, being hit and laughed at by griuos of bigger boys etc... Just school life. Because of that I barely finished elementary and then did a cheap adults school of IT. No uni for me. Poor family, no internet back then, couldn't do any private stuff. I felt stupid and hated school and learning.\n\nI have spent my entire childhood and half of adulthood locking myself up in mmorpg games, doing nothing productive or positive. No jobs for years, and when I did get one I soon did something stupid socially and get fired.\n\nI have been actively hating myself and destroying my life from the start all the way till I turned 35. At that moment, I was low enough to hit the bottom and that gave me something to jump up off. I went to live in another country on a whim decision. I picked up learning piano and game dev again. I picked up learning art, and languages. I fell in love with high quality music. I love simply creating and doing things again, without it being dependant on opinions of others.\n\nSince then I have learned to love myself, and not fight for others attention and acceptance. I got a well paid, high position job. I bought myself everything I have dreamed of, things that allow me to pursue my numerous hobbies and special interests that I have ignored all my life as \"childish and unworthy of time\" based on external opinions. I became egoistic to the point of actually being happy with my own happiness, not others.\n\nWhile I still lack any kind of close, or even far friends, or any family other than my gran, I feel like... Life is worth living. There are things to do out there, goals that we can reach, and reasons to exist that we ourselves can create or find, and not just hope to be \"given\". I no longer feel like waking up after sleep is competely optional, and not even welcome really. I believe I have, more or less, fixed my broken life.\n\nWhy even write all that? Because we're getting too many \"i destroyed my life at 18/20/25\" threads. You have not destroyed anything. We are all learning, all our lives, and there is no point at which you can't fix everything up - no matter how much you think you mess up.\n\n  \n**EDIT:** If anyone’s curious, the thing that helped me stick with this is a little “Win Log” I keep. I do it inside **CTRL – Self Improvement OS** (it’s a general self-improvement app, not just tracking). You could recreate the idea anywhere, but having it frictionless is what made it work for me.",

And combine exercise with something else, like listening to podcasts or audiobooks while you run or bike. Makes it feel less like you're sacrificing free time.\n\nAlso, do you actually need to shower every night? If you're exercising in the evening, yes. But if not, showering in the morning might free up some time at night to actually relax before bed. Small shift but it adds up.\n\nThe real answer though is that this schedule sucks and you should either move closer to work or find a new job with a shorter commute.

      "text": "Let me just tell you exactly what happened this morning because I think the specifics matter.\n\nPlan: wake 6:40am, water, settle, open MAT 237 calculus textbook by 8am, work until noon. Four hours of deep work. Simple.\n\nReality:\n\n**night before** living with my girlfriend. Last night we were together until 11:30pm, which means I was almost certainly not asleep until midnight.\n\n**6:40am** — Wake up automatically. Immediately thirsty, need to pee, feel absolutely destroyed. I stayed up with my girlfriend until 11:30 last night so I'm running on maybe 6.5 hours of sleep. The inertia is physical — like my body weighs twice as much as usual. My first instinct is to go back to sleep. Instead I use what I think of as \"opposite action\" — don't think about how bad you feel, just do the next step. I get up. I drink a big glass of water.\n\n**~7:00am** — Still feel like garbage. I negotiate with myself: okay, not 8am, I'll start at 9am instead. I open my laptop to pull up my calculus textbook. But there's something nagging at me — I emailed my professor about a missed term test and I don't know if he's replied yet. I sit there for a few minutes genuinely battling whether to check. I don't check. Instead — and I genuinely cannot fully explain how this happened — I open a website I'd been reading the night before. It's one of those sites with sarcastic 4chan commentary and I thought it was hilarious. I read it for **thirty minutes** and I'm laughing the whole time. Not scrolling mindlessly — actually laughing. Which almost makes it worse.\n\n**~7:35am** — I close the tab, feel disgusted with myself, and decide what I need is a Monster energy drink. I had explicitly, out-loud promised myself I was done with energy drinks. I go to the convenience store downstairs. I buy a Monster. I also buy four protein bars — I'm doing intermittent fasting, first meal at noon, but I figure one protein bar now is fine. I eat two of them on the walk home (maybe 90 seconds). I put the other two in the freezer, telling myself I'm done.\n\n**8:57am** — I'm back at my desk. My girlfriend, who's been asleep until now, wakes up and calls for me from her bedroom. I think \"...honestly why not\" and go. I come back at **9:20am**.\n\n**9:20am** — I immediately eat the other two protein bars from the freezer. No explanation. The fasting is just gone now. I try to start working. It's happening but I'm at like 30% — slow, foggy, effortful.\n\n**10:30am** — Girlfriend appears at my door. We spend the rest of the morning together until 11:30am.\n\n**11:30am** — I sit down. My deep work block produced roughly **40 minutes of mediocre work**.\n\nThe thing that kills me is I *watched* it happen. At every single decision point I knew what I was doing. The 4chan thing — I knew. The energy drink — I knew. The protein bars — I knew. And I did them anyway.\n\nI've read Atomic Habits, Deep Work, GTD. I'm not missing information. My environment is just completely misaligned with my intentions: girlfriend in the next room, phone accessible, convenience store one floor down, no external structure forcing me anywhere.\n\nI'm thinking about shifting the block to **12–4pm** since by noon I've naturally recovered, eaten, and cleared the morning chaos. But I'm genuinely not sure if that's a real fix or just procrastination with extra steps.\n\nHas anyone actually solved this? Not theoretically — actually solved it, in a messy real-life environment?\n\n---\n\n*Not looking for \"just have more discipline\" — I'm asking what the actual structural intervention was that changed things for you.*",

Planning Self needs to take a step back and consider impact on everything else planned, and whether Director of Self might be upset later (and if unsure, take longer and consult Directing Self). If needed, after accounting all adjustments for a Plan B (which allows the change) vs Plan A (which just puts the change request in the ‘inbox’ and carries on as planned.

      "text": "Multitasking is not always bad, but most people misunderstand where it helps and where it quietly hurts.  \n  \nThere is a big difference between stacking a low cognitive task with something useful, and splitting attention between two things that both require thinking. For example, taking a casual catch-up call while organizing your workspace for the week, prepping your task board, or sorting digital files, that works. Researching a product while you are already ordering it, comparing specs, checking reviews, looking for a discount code, that makes sense too. One action supports the other. That kind of multitasking is complementary.  \n  \nWhere it falls apart is during actual deep work. Writing while answering Slack messages, building a report while checking email, coding while bouncing between notifications, that is not efficiency, that is context switching. Every switch forces your brain to reload context, and that reload cost compounds. You end the day drained, yet somehow behind.  \n  \nThe problem is the boundary gets blurred. We justify splitting focus because sometimes pairing tasks works. But the rule is simple, mechanical with mental is fine, mental with mental is expensive. If both tasks require real thinking, one will suffer. Usually both do.  \n  \nMultitasking is not the villain. Misapplying it is.",

          "text": "I completely agree with this take. What most people call multitasking is really just rapid context switching, and that absolutely shreds your ability to do meaningful work. I’ve learned the hard way that writing something thoughtful while bouncing between Slack, email, and notifications feels productive in the moment, but at the end of the day I’m exhausted and behind. The distinction here between mechanical plus mental versus mental plus mental is exactly right.\n\nIf this resonates with you, I strongly recommend [Deep Work by Cal Newport](https://amzn.to/4rEWDiN). It goes much deeper into the exact dynamic this post is describing. Newport makes the case that the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks is becoming both increasingly rare and increasingly valuable. He backs it up with research on attention residue and the cognitive cost of task switching, which maps directly to the “reload cost” mentioned here.\n\nWhat I appreciate about the book is that it does not just say “turn off your phone.” It explains why shallow work expands to fill your time, how busyness becomes a proxy for productivity, and how modern workplace norms quietly reward responsiveness over depth. That is where most of us get trapped. We think we are being effective because we are active.\n\nNewport also offers practical frameworks for building deep work into your life. He talks about scheduling depth, reducing digital noise, and being intentional about when you allow fragmentation. The key is not eliminating multitasking entirely, but being deliberate about when you do shallow, complementary tasks versus when you protect uninterrupted cognitive effort.",

There's two mountains for every long term task: The first smaller mountain where dopamine is high because everything is new and fun to explore.

This time you don't have the dopamine you initially had, so it's where a lot of people give up, roughly 90% of people who do self projects give up during the second mountain.  Then when you get to the top you're king of the world.\n\nA career coach might be able to help you. (No personal experience.)\n\nThere is a trick I do to push through that low time where it's hard to continue the grind: I don't tell people of all the awesome stuff I've been up to, from the first mountain.  I keep it a light secret.  If I need help I'll let people know what I'm up to, but for the most part I keep it to myself.  This is because the unconscious mind can't differentiate between talking about something and it actually happening well, so when you talk about achievements to people it signals to your unconscious mind you've already achieved everything and no longer need to work at it.  New drive stops coming from your unconscious and it's only a matter of time before the old drive that pushed you forward runs out.

We don’t owe our time to anyone and everyone learns and gets comfortable in different time frames. If you’ve been at a place for 1 and a half year, and you’re thinking about leaving, you’ve either learned everything you can that you find the work boring, or you mind has pivoted to something you’re more interested in.

      "text": "\\*\\*TLDR\n\nI felt lost and depressed while preparing for a tough competitive exam despite investing heavily in it. Reading the Gita helped, but meditation and yoga brought real change. They gave me clarity and stability, helped me stay involved in what was needed, secure a job, and finally see results from my efforts.\\*\\*\n\nSome time back, I really did not know what to do. I had chosen to give one of the toughest competitive exams, but I found myself unable to study for it. I was not able to manage the syllabus well. I had left everything and invested so much money in resources and coaching just to crack that exam. I literally felt helpless. I did not know what to do. It was a really tough phase of my life.\n\nI went into severe depression for some time. I even tried taking medicines, but that did not work much.\n\nUntil a friend of mine recommended that I read the Bhagavad Gita and introduced me to spirituality. Though I found the Bhagavad Gita immensely useful, just reading the book did not bring a lasting change in me.\n\nThat is when I started following some yogic practices. I started meditation and yoga. It has been seven to eight months now, and I feel that was one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nIt was not like meditation and yoga solved everything for me, but I was able to reflect on my thoughts. I understood that I was too identified with my thought process and that I did not have to be. What was going on in my head was affecting me emotionally, and that was why I was unable to get out of it.\n\nThese reflections and pauses really helped me overcome depression and gain stability in my life. What really helped me was the clarity it gave, which helped me progress in my career. I understood the importance of involvement.\n\nI read this quote by Sadhguru:\n\n\"When you do not know what to choose, show total involvement in everything. Then life will choose, and it is never wrong.\"\n\nThis quote really hit me, and I tried to do everything that was required of me. I started taking tuitions to help my family with some financial difficulties while continuing my studies.\n\nThrough this, I found that teaching students helped me gain more clarity in the topics. I came to know where I was lacking and how the level of involvement I had, along with the thoughts I was preoccupied with, was hampering my studies.\n\nNow that I had stabilized myself through meditation and yoga, my thought process was no longer the issue. So I was able to study with total involvement.\n\nI also found that I was really good at certain topics. So first, I decided to secure a job and then prepare for the competitive exam that I want to crack the most.\n\nRecently, I gave some other exams as well, and they went really well, well beyond my expectations.\n\nIt was not that everything became easy after meditation and yoga, but the amount of effort I was putting in started giving results. I was able to see outcomes from the work I put in, which was not the case earlier.\n\nJust wanted to share this.\n\nThank you for reading.",

Always proactive, never had to try hard to get good grades - and then suddenly when I got into university I just... froze. Couldn't handle the workload, couldn't even pull myself together.\n\nThat's when I started reflecting and looking for the real problem. And I realized - the program just wasn't for me. Computer engineering wasn't my thing.\n\nSo I taught myself design on the side, completely separate from university. Today I'm 28, running my own design company (six figures a year), doing what I love.\n\nDid I need motivation? No. I needed the right application of my talents and interests.\n\nSo think about it - what do you actually want in 5 years? 10? Are you studying for yourself or for your parents? Is earning well important to you or is money not the issue?\n\nThe answers to those questions will unblock you more than any productivity hack ever will.",

Shrink your tasks until it feels almost stupid not to start. When motivation is gone, stop asking yourself to “finish” anything. The goal is just to begin. I like to set a single Pomodoro (I use pomofocus.io) and tell myself I’m only working until the timer ends. Don't think about anything beyond that first cycle.\n2. Similar to above, take mini breaks while you study. Your brain also needs time to process that information, and there are diminishing returns if you study for too long.\n3. Use habit contracts. Especially if you are struggling with accountability and procrastinating studying early for tests, you HAVE to pre-commit to a consequence before your future self tries to negotiate their way out of doing the thing. Habit contracts will be your best friend. I use Line (try-line.app) because I like having it on my computer, but I know there are also other mobile apps that do the same.\n\nYou got this!",

          "text": "Oh, please, don't listen to the people saying you have ADHD. 🤦🏼‍♀️. No one should be able to diagnose you online, or even suggest to get a diagnosis. Not being able to focus and make effort when you never had to in your life, is normal. I don't care if I get downvoted.\n\nHere is the full DSM 5 criteria for ADHD. Only a professional should be able to give a diagnosis. \n\n•••\n\nDSM-5 criteria for ADHD\nHealthcare providers use the guidelines in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth edition (DSM-5),2 to help diagnose ADHD. This diagnostic standard helps ensure that people are appropriately diagnosed and treated for ADHD. Using the same standard across communities can also help determine how many children have ADHD, and how public health is impacted by this condition.\n\nThe number of symptoms required for an ADHD diagnosis (by age group) are as follows:‎\n\n■ Six or more symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity for children up to age 16 years, OR\n\n■ Five or more symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity for adolescents ages 17 years and older and adults.\n\nPeople with ADHD show a persistent pattern of inattentionA and/or hyperactivityB–impulsivityC that interferes with functioning or development:\n\nDSM-5 criteria for ADHD diagnosis ‎\nIncluded below are the DSM-5 criteria in shortened form. Please note that they are presented just for your information. Only trained healthcare providers can diagnose or treat ADHD.\n\nInattention\nSymptoms\nNOTE: Symptoms of inattention have been present for at least 6 months, and they are inappropriate for developmental level.\nOften fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or with other activities.\nOften has trouble holding attention on tasks or play activities.\nOften does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.\nOften does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., loses focus, side-tracked).\nOften has trouble organizing tasks and activities.\nOften avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to do tasks that require mental effort over a long period of time (such as schoolwork or homework).\nOften loses things necessary for tasks and activities (e.g. school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones).\nIs often easily distracted.\nIs often forgetful in daily activities.\n\nHyperactivity-impulsivity\nSymptoms\nNOTE: Symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity have been present for at least 6 months, and they are inappropriate for the person's developmental level.\nOften fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat.\nOften leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected.\nOften runs about or climbs in situations where it is not appropriate (adolescents or adults may be limited to feeling restless).\nOften unable to play or take part in leisure activities quietly.\nIs often “on the go” acting as if “driven by a motor.”\nOften talks excessively.\nOften blurts out an answer before a question has been completed.\nOften has trouble waiting their turn.\nOften interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games).\n\nIn addition to the above criteria, the following conditions must also be met:\nSeveral inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present before age 12 years.\nSeveral symptoms are present in two or more settings, (such as at home, school or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).\nThere is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, school, or work functioning.\nThe symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (such as a mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, or a personality disorder). The symptoms do not happen only during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder.\n\nFor more information about diagnosis and treatment throughout the lifespan, please visit the websites of the National Resource Center on ADHD and the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nSource : https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/diagnosis/index.html#cdc_testing_when_to_tested-dsm-5-criteria-for-adhd",

Do you think that moving the standing desks by hand actually takes up a lot of time and saving it would create a productive environment? I am considering getting a standing table with automation. Any you've tried?  \n  \nFinally, another thing that ends up taking a lot my time, cleaning the floors. Do you think that robot vacuums are actually good enough to not require cleaning later on? I am considering getting a dreame, they showed some great models at their ces booth. I was in fact able to see another robot vacuum from xlean as well. It allowed for wet and dry both spills to get a thorough clean. Now, while I feel like both are great options, both of them are yet to launch I think. So, I'd love to have suggestions in this context.  \n  \nWould love to know if there is another similar model available that I might have missed.",

You're not saving time, you're just spending money on convenience that doesn't move the needle.\n\nFor actual time savers, look at things that run in the background while you do other stuff.

Did you even have real time off?” And he didn’t even think 3 seconds: “Of course. Much more than now.”\n\nHe’s a tech-savvy pensioner in his 80’s.
