      "text": "My company went fully remote in early 2023. I was excited at first. No more commute, no more pretending to look busy, I could actually focus on work. That lasted maybe three months.\n\nI don't know when it started but at some point I stopped using my desk entirely. It became a place to dump laundry. Every morning I would just grab my laptop and sink into the couch. Then the couch became my office, my lunch spot, my Netflix spot, my everything spot. I was replying to slack messages at 11pm in the same position I woke up in. Last month my manager asked me to turn on my camera for a call and I realized I was literally horizontal. I had to pretend my camera was broken because I could not sit up fast enough without it being weird.\n\nI started seeing a therapist a few weeks ago, mostly for anxiety stuff. At some point I mentioned how I felt like I was drifting through days and she asked me where I work. I said the couch. She kind of laughed and said something like, your brain can not tell the difference between work and rest if you never move. It sounded too simple to actually matter but it stuck with me.\n\nSo last week I cleared a corner in my bedroom. Got an old desk off marketplace for 40 bucks. Bought an actual desk chair because the dining chair was killing my back. First morning sitting there felt stupid honestly. Like I was playing pretend office. But I also finished more actual work by noon than I had in weeks. I am not saying it fixed everything. Some days I still end up back on the couch by 3pm. But at least now I notice when it happens.\n\nTwo years of drifting and the answer was literally just sitting somewhere else. Wild how that works. ",

This is important for socialising and changing up your environment. It's often when working from home you just have one space, which is home.

It’s easy to go days without leaving the house when you wfh so for me even just a 20 minute walk with my dog makes a huge difference. \n\nI also sometimes will take a drive after work. It doesn’t have to be anywhere in particular, but it kind of mimics a little commute and splits up the end of the work day and your personal time.  Congrats on the positive changes!",

Messages, comments, even bad news. Pausing for a few minutes saved me a lot of unnecessary stress.\n\n• I keep my phone out of reach while working or eating. Not off. Just not in my hand. Huge difference.\n\n• I started finishing the smallest task first. Making the bed, clearing one email, washing one dish. Momentum matters more than motivation. The Soothfy App provides the Anchor + Novelty framework to make my workflow clear and consistent.\n\n• I stopped over-explaining myself. A simple “no” or “I can’t” is enough most of the time.\n\n• I go outside every day, even if it’s just 5 minutes. Sounds silly, but it resets my head better than scrolling.\n\n• I realized watching random content while tired wasn’t relaxing at all. so i choose sleeping more than any hack I tried.",

      "text": "*\"I can't focus during lectures anymore\"*\n\n*\"Why is studying so hard now?\"*\n\n*\"I used to be a good student but can't concentrate for even 20 minutes\"*\n\nMany students are genuinely confused. They're following the typical study methods (in some cases, methods they've used for a long time), but finding it harder and harder to retain information, sit through a lecture without mentally drifting, or read more than a page without reaching for their phone.\n\nWhat students are experiencing is born out in the data. Dr. Gloria Mark's research tracked our declining attention spans:\n\nThe average college student now checks social media 118 times per day.\n\nBut the problem's rooted in something deeper than just your study sessions. Count how many things you're doing simultaneously throughout they day:\n\n* Walking to class while responding to texts\n* Eating while watching Shorts\n* Studying with friends while everyone scrolls phones\n* Listening to lectures while browsing different Reddit subs\n\nIf you're struggling to focus in class or while studying, I'm willing to bet almost **all** of your day is filled with this type of rapid multitasking and context switching. (It's really about the context-switching: the rapid and constant jumping from screen to screen, tab to tab, app to app, swipe to swipe.)\n\nBecause every moment you're switching contexts, you're training your brain to need constant stimulation. Your neural pathways literally rewire to reject sustained focus.\n\nSome call this 'popcorn brain' — your mind constantly jumping from thought to thought, unable to settle on any single task. Like kernels popping erratically in every direction, your attention bounces around without control.\n\nThen you try to read a textbook chapter and your brain physically rebels, because you've spent the other 15 hours of your day training it to do the exact opposite. And you wonder why you can't focus when you need to.\n\nThe fix is simple but not easy: Single-task throughout your day as much as possible, not just during study time. Read without music. Walk without podcasts. Eat without screens. One tab open for assignments.\n\nYes, it feels uncomfortable. Your brain will crave stimulation. That discomfort means you're rebuilding your attention span.\n\nMost study advice focuses on those 2-3 hours of dedicated study time. But if the rest of your day trains your brain for fractured attention and constant novel stimulation, you're fighting a losing battle.",

I have a couple of them back on my phone but I find I'm a little better at keeping the doomscrolling in check. I also found audiobooks and podcast to be a huge problem for me. They're fine in moderation but I reached a point where I was losing it if I had to do so much as wash a few dishes without a YouTube video or audiobook playing in the background and I don't think that's healthy so I started forcing myself to do stuff without it. I still listen to audiobooks if I'm deep cleaning, on a long run or cooking something that takes a long time but we feel the need to be entertained literally 24/7 and have way too much media available at all times and I dont think the constant stimuli is healthy.",

Then repeat thing with focus on the task. There is alternative way - harder - currently mostly forgotten because we are searching for something easier - it’s called discipline - and need to trained consistently in other case you are getting worse.\n\nFor few second atomic habits helped - removing from environment all the things that require making constant decisions - candies when you don’t want to get fat, notifications - when you don’t want to be distracted and so on.

Otherwise, I know I'd get overwhelmed. Keeping it to a minimum helps make it more manageable. Then, only if feasible, I'll add more tasks one at a time. But I'm just trying to get by right now. I can't go all superhuman overnight; that'll never be sustainable.\n\nI will acknowledge that using the app is yet another thing to do on my list, and I just started using it, but I'm trying it for now.\n\nI think I reached a point where I realized that my lack of productivity had to change. I couldn't keep letting everything go and letting it pile up. I still don't want to do anything but I'm trying to force myself even when I just want to escape. And again, keeping it small for now is helping me feel like it's more possible to get a handle on everything.

I always crash in fall and bounce back in spring, and my light therapy lamp has made it feel like it's spring in February.\n* Adderall.

For whatever reason it always makes me feel calm in those situations instead of amping me up more like you would expect with a stimulant.\n* Doing a better job of resting. Meditation, taking quality breaks, sleeping more, relaxing more etc. Maybe it's common sense, but I find the more well rested I am, the more relaxed I am, and the less pressure I put on myself the more I actually get done and the less I procrastinate.\n\nFor a few months I was getting very little done.

So write down all your symptoms, when they started and make sure you're getting good sleep, hydration, nutrition, activity.\n\nThen, check for burnout or depression. Are you negative all the time, or feel upset about small things a lot more? Anxiety about something?\n\nDid you have the flu or a big illness before this started? Takes a few months to get back all the depleted nutrients in the body after viral.\n\nIn the meantime, try pomodoro (focusmate is a good website for co-working) - but likely the reason is not lack of willpower or discipline. So keep a journal of exactly what is happening (getting distracted? feeling tired? feeling bored? muscle pain? feeling upset? anxiety?) -- it'll help you see the patterns.\n\nWhat you're describing is very similar to ADHD and anxiety. But if it started recently then it's likely not ADHD. So, is there some stress or anxiety that's happening in this timeframe?",

The person writing the email or message sees it as neutral at worst, but when we read it, our brain interprets it more negatively than it was intended. There are lots of reasons for this, including the ones you mentioned. \n\nWe’re hardwired for a negative bias generally, this is a survival instinct. At work, this is our livelihood and our income and reputation are on the line, so that survival instinct (like a physical fight or flight reaction) becomes more psychological. \n\nIt’s also complicated by office politics and hierarchies, if there’s an unconscious belief of some kind of fight for power, whether in role or a project. We might interpret something as negative if someone is a higher rank than us, or they could be the same level but we feel like they’re trying to act like they’re above us. \n\nBut it’s also the same as any other written communication outside of work - there’s no tone of voice or facial expression or body language, and this makes up so much of a communication that without it you could read a message in almost any way. This is exacerbated by so much remote working. \n\nAdd in some overthinking, paranoia, work stress, or just general anxiety, and emails are an absolute nightmare.",

So while they loved to defend their one word replies and incredibly short/half assed responses when they were the sender and the topic wasn't important to them, their tune changed when they were the recipients of short half assed replies when they were the recipients and the conversation was important to *them*.\n\nEdit: One I remember was the team member wanting to set up a meeting to go over their performance, progression and to discuss a raise.  They were a middle of the road employer overall but their communication was... Infuriating and often caused issues. So I spoke to HR beforehand to clear it first and then engaged in the same half assed, dismissive, couldn't be bothered to put any effort in when it came to setting up the meeting and going over the review.... After several \"ok\" \"ya fine\" \"sure\" \"I guess\" responses over the week to their setting up a time, sending over a list of accomplishments etc they were so discouraged that they asked to cancel the meeting altogether because they felt it  was pointless because it was obvious I wasn't going to give them a raise or a positive review.\n\n... Guess who finally got the point that it's wholly unacceptable to respond to an e-mail containing several ideas and points and which requires information in the response with an \"ok\".  Or that a *thumbs up* isn't an appropriate acknowledgement of task assignments.",

It gives a small dopamine hit without the emotional risk of actually starting.\n\nThe trap is this: preparation has no natural finish line. You can always refine the system one more time.\n\nHere are a few things that actually break the loop:\n\n1. Cap planning time aggressively Give yourself 10 to 15 minutes max to plan. Set a timer. When it rings, you must start the first task, even if the plan feels imperfect. Constraints create action.\n2. Define a “messy first action” Instead of preparing to work, start badly on purpose. Open the document and write a rough paragraph. Solve one tiny piece. Send the imperfect draft. Momentum kills overplanning.\n3. Separate planning days from execution blocks Have one weekly reset where you reorganize everything. Outside of that, you are not allowed to redesign the system. You only execute.\n4. Replace “optimize” with “ship” Ask yourself: what can I finish in the next 30 minutes that would move this forward? Not improve the structure. Not refine the workflow. Finish.\n5. Track output, not organization At the end of the day, measure visible results. Pages written. Problems solved. Emails sent. If it is not output, it does not count.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is this: clarity comes from action, not from better planning.\n\nIf this hit home, you would probably love 60-Second Productivity.\n\nIt is a weekly newsletter built for people who want to stop circling productivity and actually experience it. Each week you get one actionable tip you can apply immediately, no long reads, no theory spirals.\n\nIf you are tired of preparing to start and ready to actually move, subscribe here: [https://60secondproductivity.substack.com/](https://60secondproductivity.substack.com/)\n\nOne minute a week.

      "text": "I've tried everything to stay consistent with self-improvement. Habit trackers, accountability partners, motivational quotes on my wall even. Nothing lasted more than 3 weeks.  I honestly started feeling incapable / not meant for it.\n\nThe problem wasn't discipline. It was that I kept forgetting I was actually making progress.\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\nI start strong. First week, I hit the gym 4 times, meal prep Sunday, wake up at 6 AM. I feel unstoppable.\n\nWeek 3, I miss a workout. Then two. I sleep in one day. Suddenly I feel like I'm \"falling off\" and the voice in my head says \"see, you always do this.\" FUCK.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'm not actually back at zero. I just forgot about the 15 workouts I crushed, the 12 early mornings, the week I stuck to my meal plan perfectly.\n\nThe human brain has a negativity bias. Turns out we remember the misses way more than the wins. So even when we are objectively progressing, it feels like we're failing.\n\n# What changed for me:\n\nI started keeping a \"Win Log.\"\n\nEvery single day, I write down 1-3 things I actually did. Not what I planned to do. Not what I \"should\" have done. Just what I actually executed on.\n\nSome examples from my log:\n\n* \"Went to gym even though I felt like shit\"\n* \"Had a hard conversation with my gay brother I'd been avoiding\"\n* \"Didn't doom scroll for 2 hours before bed\"\n* \"Followed through on my morning routine\"\n* \"Applied to 3 jobs\"\n\n# Why this works:\n\n**1. You create evidence.**\n\nWhen your brain tells you \"you're not capable,\" you have a list proving otherwise. On day 32, when I wanted to quit, I scrolled through my log and saw 31 days of proof that I *can* execute. That's not motivation.  That’s fucking data.\n\n**2. You break the amnesia cycle.**\n\nMost people only remember the last 3 days of their journey. Everything before that is fuzzy. The Win Log makes your progress tangible. You can literally see how far you've come. This creates an infinite loop where your wins fuel your actions, which then fuel your wins, which then fuel your actions..  So you’re naturally able to just keep going\n\n**3. It reframes \"bad\" days.**\n\nEven on days I felt like I failed, I could usually find 1-2 small wins. \"Didn't work out, but I did drink 2L of water and got 7 hours of sleep.\" Literally didn’t fail.\n\n# The rule I follow:\n\nLog at least 1 win per day. No matter what.\n\nEven if it's \"I got out of bed.\" Even if it's \"I didn't give up.\" Something.\n\nBecause here's the truth: you're probably doing way better than you think. You're just not keeping score.\n\nYour wins are fuel. But only if you remember them.\n\n**TLDR:** Started logging daily wins instead of tracking habits. Turns out I wasn't failing, I just had amnesia about my progress. When you feel like quitting, concrete evidence of past execution is way more powerful than motivation.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nWow, didn't expect this to resonate with so many people (it's my first post anywhere to get attention). Thank you for sharing your own stories about struggling with negative self-talk, it's wild how universal this experience is.\n\nJust to clarify how this is different from a habit tracker: **Habits feel like obligation. Wins are evidence of capability.** One creates pressure, the other creates confidence through proof\n\nFor anyone asking what I use to keep everything organized: I use an app called **\"CTRL - Self Improvement OS\"** to log my wins.  It's the best looking app I have installed",

And to be honest, I still find myself slipping back into it sometimes.\n\nFirst thing, you might be burned out, depressed, or some messy combo of both. If you can talk to a therapist or a doctor, I really think it’s worth doing. And you don’t have to wait until things get “bad enough” to deserve help.\n\nWhat helped me most was stopping the constant “I need to fix myself” pressure. When you’re already burnout, pushing harder usually makes it worse. So for a while, I gave myself permission to do nothing without guilt. Rest is not failing, it’s recovery.\n\nAt my darkest time, I had anxiety and depression hitting at the same time, plus physical symptoms. I didn’t want to eat, didn’t want to talk to anyone, just wanted to disappear. At the same time I desperately wanted someone to be there, and I also felt terrified of being a burden to them. It’s a brutal mindset.\n\nOne mindset shift that helped was realizing this: even if you have friends and family around, you’re still the person who has to take your own hand. No one is coming. That sounds harsh, but for me it was weirdly empowering.I stopped waiting to “be helped or healed” and just focused on tiny steps I could actually do.\n\nSo here’s what I’d suggest\n\n* First, for now, give yourself a break. Stop pushing yourself to do things. You’re not lazy, you’re just out of gas.\n* Second, really hold onto this: if you feel like you’re at rock bottom, then any tiny thing you do counts as moving forward. Seriously. Eating something, sleeping, making it through the day. If you’re still here today, that’s progress.\n* Third, can you still eat? Can you still keep work going at least a little? Then just focus on that kind of basic stuff. Do what you have energy for. When you don’t, lie down. Rest. The more you force it, the more burned out you get.\n* Fourth, it can help to listen to people who’ve been through it. Like podcasts or videos that are just real, human stories not the super sciencey how to fix your life stuff. Just hearing someone say yeah I was there too and this is how I got through it can make you feel less alone.\n\nAnd again, if you can, please reach out to a doctor or therapist. You don’t have to carry this by yourself, even if it feels like you should.\n\nYou’re not lazy. You’re not a failure. You sound exhausted. And that’s something you can come back from.",

I often get inspiration from subreddits like \nr/biohacking \nr/MTHFR r/Supplements r/B12_deficiency and the likes.\nTo get laboratory tests you need to get a sample and get it sent to a lab. It is often easier to do at the doctor. Some tests are ok to order online and send samples by mail. SNP array tests like Ancestry's is cheap but still useful. After the test, you download results and then you upload them to third parties (e.g. geneticgenie) that help you analyse results. If you see genes reported that have some clinical significance you can research them further. If you have your symptoms and labs and genes you are a million miles closer to understanding what might be a bit out of whack. The other part of my learning journey has been to try supplements that claim some benefit I am interested in, research how they are supposed to work and if (3 out of 4 do nothing) they make a significant difference then try to figure out a theory of why. (Not always easy so don't try forever). My top tips are vitamin D, magnesium, an active forms B-complex, to research the methylation cycle and boost it, research ATP generation and boost that too.",

All of a sudden I kept uncontrollably procrastinating and putting off work to doomscroll or watch tv. \n\nI struggled with procrastinating previously, but it had never been such a consistent and persistent issue to the point where it felt like I couldn’t overcome it.  This went on for basically the entirety of 2025. I’m trying to improve things and have done a bit better but there’s still an underlying problem that I just realized. I’m not sure how accurate this is, but it almost feels like someone swapped out the brain I’ve had all my life, for another one that has ADHD. \n\nI have all these goals and ambitions and I need to remain productive but then I just find myself fighting the urge to do literally anything else but the task at hand. It’s making me feel hopeless and really scared about how I am going to handle my life and responsibilities. I don’t want to throw away everything I’m working towards.\n\nI’ve never had this issue with being unable to focus before and have always been focused on remaining productive and was doing well at it.\n\nI don’t believe it’s me being burnt out because I wasn’t necessarily working myself to the bone before it happened.

Even if you weren't \"burnt out\" from work, you can be \"burnt out\" from stimulation.\n\nYour baseline dopamine is too low to \"start\" boring tasks, so try out 24 hours of zero digital input.  \nThen delete the doomscroll apps and use the web versions. They have a simpler design without so many triggers. (At least for a while to reset).  \nHigh-arousal content has re-wired your \"interest\" threshold. Practice doing nothing for 10 mins a day. (And this is hard tbh, but can be the best thing to help)\n\nFocus is a muscle that has atrophied because you stopped lifting \"heavy\" (deep, slow work) and started lifting \"air\" (quick, easy content).

Sudden focus issues do not always mean ADHD, they can come from stress, anxiety, sleep debt, constant dopamine inputs, or just a nervous system that never really gets to power down anymore. What helped me was stopping the fight to “focus like I used to” and instead rebuilding structure from the ground up. short work blocks, fewer inputs, and removing the easy escape hatches mattered more than motivation. If the fear keeps ramping up, it is also worth talking to a professional, not because something is wrong with you, but because clarity helps. This is fixable, even if it does not feel like it right now.",

But I’ve been graduate for one and a half year now and ever since then I’m working from home because I’m trying to build my own business.\n\nI feel like this time period has went to waste because all I’ve done is procrastinate and see the time pass by being stuck in analysis paralysis and executive dysfunction loops. Not sure how to approach this and already losing hope.\n\nLast month, I was fed up and exhausted so I booked an appointment with a psychiatrist that is scheduled to happen this week and I’m counting days crazily since I need an escape from this behavior.\n\nAnyway, a few things that have helped is creating some systems and structure that can get me going. Like, I discovered Focusmate for accountability and also keeping my to-do list thin with three tasks per day. Personally, structure felt like the best solution but again there are some points where I lose track and get distracted.\n\nNot sure what’s the solution would be but maybe we can keep each other updated as we try different things?",

          "text": "You've always had ADHD but it was masked or managed until something like your move off campus and isolation changed how you masked / coped.\n\nOr you haven't got it but something else that can develop suddenly due to change. It's not something that can develop, well IIRC not without some physical trauma.\n\nADHD traits and issues can appear suddenly due to many other causes. The biggies are anxiety and depression, but not just those. I'd tend not to use the ADHD term without real cause to think that such as having the traits from childhood throughout your life. There's no such thing as adult ADHD it's just that perhaps someone who's had it from childhood only just realises they've got a problem there and it's ADHD that they find out after a diagnosis. \n\nWords are often harmful to neurodivergent people and they can feel like inappropriate use of the disorder belittles the very real problems in their life that ADHD causes. Not that the OPs problems aren't real but they're new after a change not through their life from childhood. There is already a great deal of negativity over ADHD that naysayers write it off as a serious disorder by saying everyone has it. By calling your very real issues ADHD or ADHD like is possibly seen as close to the POV of those who are so negative towards ADHD.\n\nSo I'd say to the OP and others it is genuinely better to talk about this without linking it to ADHD, but perhaps calling it something else. Perhaps calling it a mystery condition or something. Words are perhaps more significant to people with ND disorders and they can hurt in ways people without it don't really understand. \n\nSorry about this rant or lecture. I mean no harm by it only I think it's helpful to be aware of such things when posting and replying to the OP.\n\nAbove all I feel the OP has a health issue that isn't being helped by Redditors, but could be helped by a medical professional. So the OP IMHO should seek that help and leave Reddit for other things such as leisure or personal interest matters. Health issues need health or medical professionals not John Q Public. We can't truly help you except by giving you support and encouragement to get the professional help that is needed. \n\nGood luck in that direction if you decide to go for professional help with your issues.

Some days the win is replying to one email or doing ten minutes and stopping.

If it needs motivation, perfect sleep, and zero stress, it’s not really a system.\n\nI write about this stuff from a normal perspective because I kept failing with the usual advice too.

          "text": "don't just have goals, have minimums. like say your goal is to do 3 30 minute runs each week. maybe your minimum is 2 10 minute runs. \n\nalso as you live ask yourself, how much chaos does this add to my life? most people just pile it on until they break. think about how couples who have twins have a higher divorce rate--shouldn't be anything wrong with having twins but it's double the potential chaotic problems of a single baby, sometimes more because now one baby crying might wake up the other. the added stress causes something important to these people to break down because they had more chaos than they bargained for. and with twins that is one of the things that just happens sometimes. but you can also ask yourself, if i have no pets, how many random vet bills will i be getting if i get one? and if i have one pet and can handle it just fine, what about another? each one is a gamble. one pet might need nothing other than some food, a bed, and some toys, and the next one might need constant vet bills... maybe not even a problematic amount for you, but these problems won't care about their timing.\n\nalso learn to find your productivity to not just be a grind but relaxing. there might be some parts that are always work to you. but let's say you're an illustrator building a portfolio. some days you want to fully lock in, organize, design. but other days you might be completely drained. you can still get a pad and sketch while watching comfort movies.\n\nalso be willing to accept imperfect conditions, subpar tools. if you want to write every day, some days that will mean you get a coffee on a sunny walk through nature, feel inspired, and juuuust as you get home it starts to rain just like your moody gothic horror novel you're working on and it feels perfect and you wish every writing session could go like that. other days you might have to write on your phone while you're in line at the passport office while a baby is crying near you.\n\nBUT those days when everything sucks and you STILL do SOMETHING are so key. THEY are what tell you you mean business. When you want to go for a run and the weather is truly insurmountably terrible so you move some furniture around to give you space to do some calisthenics at home, THAT is how you know you can actually hit your goals. Let it be EXCITING to have to make things work and have your momentum challenged because when you push back just a little to keep moving forward, that little means a lot.\n\nalso try not to have systems that see one small failure as a complete failure. people who ascribe to streaks really have this problem--they feel great doing something for a week, 30 days, fifty days. then they miss ONE and instead of saying wow i have been hitting my target 98% of the time they go oh noooo my streak has ENDED! it's all over! give yourself some grace to miss some steps. \n\nalso when you fail: analyze. react. what can you do to prevent yourself from failing for the same reason again? learn from your mistake and think of it as a lesson, a strengthening, rather than a failure. \n\nalso: don't let your productivity systems ADD stress and more work. when you got to track and check a ton of stuff that interferes with just doing what you need to do. simplify your system to just one interface like one calendar app or a physical calendar or whatever works best for you.\n\nalso be willing to just admit you don't have the time or energy for certain goals right now and cut them--not in a sad way but a freeing way. don't let your number 7 life goal get in the way of your number 1-3 goals. \n\nplan for chaos. it's easy to set a bunch of goals and start acting on them when everything's good. we feel like we can become a Renaissance Man in January when there's nothing going on and we set these goals we want to do all year. then spring and summer hits and there's social obligations creeping up, maybe we are outdoors more and get injured, we socialize more so we get sick more, there's weddings, birthdays, etc. should we all feel like failures because we can't do in one hour of free time what we used to do when we had five hours a day free? no.\n\nso, don't be afraid to be 'greedy' when you DO have the time and energy. but think of those as bonus goals. maybe you CAN get into woodworking this year.... but that doesn't mean you'll do it every day. maybe you'll do it every day until the first day of spring, then it will be sunday mornings until October when you begin working on Christmas presents sunday mornings and wednesday evenings. \n\nAnd you still might need to be adaptable from there. But the point is your plan accounts for 'predictable chaos' and it is not a failure to reduce your output during these times because that is part of the plan.\n\nif we want to be extra from here we could do something kind of like sick days at work. We get twenty 'skip it' days per year but you have to physically track them to make it feel harder to cheat, like putting beads into a jar. Whether you intend to miss a day, or do it unintentionally, you MUST put a bead into the jar. something like this will help us really think: is my life actually chaotic and low-energy enough right now, or can I power through and save this \"sick day\" for something worse?",

I was waking up motivated one day, but life got in the way the next, so every time it felt like I was starting over again.\n\nWhat actually helped me get back on track was to create a (rather sophisticated) system where my to-do list is completely dynamic and changes based on importance and overdue score. For example, if I can't do the dishes today, it's not the end of the world, that action stays on my list and is there as soon as I have the time for it again, but other actions are allowed take precedence in an intelligent way: if my \"5-minute Tabata\" action becomes overdue, that automatically takes precedence in my list, because I've set it as more important than doing the dishes. After doing my 5-minutes of exercise, I still get a chance to do the dishes.\n\nThe setup might sound complicated, but it's really not. I now have over 50 recurring actions that are automatically being prioritized, so it's easy to get back on track when \"life happens\". I might not be able to score 100% every day, but 90% is pretty damn achievable with this kind of clarity. And to think that I could have \"juggled\" 50 recurring actions with random schedules (some daily, some monthly and some at strange intervals, like 8 hours) consistently, without such a system, would be completely naive. Having it in place almost feels like cheating at times. It's my hidden superpower.\n\nThe system I'm talking about is Forjd and I've made it available online. Look it up if you're interested, it's quite fun and it almost plays like a game :)",

I block everything. Additionally, I might install a visible blocker at my desk, so I can't get distracted by my surroundings.\n* More important to me is my calendar.

Get clear with the goal, or have an idea of the bigger goal (what you want to achieve). Knowing what to do is important.\n\n2. Choose 3 tasks that would move me forward and make the day feel like a success.\n\n2. Set time blocks and make sure that it gets BLOCKED (no distractions, other tasks, commitments). ONLY THE TASK AT HAND.\n\n  \nPlanning before the day also helps as it removes the decision fatigue from you.

If I have to fight myself every hour I will lose. So I make the right thing the easy thing. Phone in another room. Laptop with only the tab I need open. Clear desk. Water next to me. I remove decisions before I start. Second is starting before I feel ready. Waiting to feel focused is a trap. I set a small entry point like ten minutes and I begin even if my brain feels scattered. Nine times out of ten focus shows up after action not before. The first few minutes are friction. If you survive that, momentum takes over.\n\nThird is single tasking aggressively. No music with lyrics. No multitasking. No checking messages “quickly.” I treat attention like something fragile. Once it fractures it takes way more energy to rebuild than people realize. So I protect it hard. Another underrated one is tracking output not time. Instead of “I studied three hours” it becomes “I finished two problem sets” or “I wrote 800 words.” It shifts you from sitting there to actually producing. Time can be faked. Output cannot.\n\nAnd finally I respect my energy. I do hard things when my brain is sharp and easy admin when I am tired. A lot of people try to brute force deep work at 10 pm and then think they have a discipline issue. Sometimes it is just bad timing. You already named strong ones. Limiting phone use is huge. Quiet is powerful. Classical works because it removes verbal interference. The real theme behind all of this is the same though. Control your environment and lower friction. Focus is less about forcing your brain and more about removing what pulls it away.",

          "text": " I think you have explained it more succcinctly than I do. I liken it to climbing a big mountain. I can see the summit = project goal and even see the later path or route up. With a vague task (project in my comment) I just cannot see the start of the path, it is covered by thick vegetation or low cloud = no way into the project.\n\nI find that I ignore the start of such tasks or projects and seek out some simple task related to the area of the project that may or may not end up being wholly relevent. Such as document review around the project area. It might not go into the finished output of the project but it is something I can actually start and do. I find doing something simple around the project always leads to finding the start of the path to the end.\n\nThere is a term for this I think but I cannot recall. It is about feeling like you are doing something and freeing the mind on the task by doing not thinking so hard. I think vague tasks or projects (without scope adequately defined) leads to procrastination by overthinking it. A simple, even five or ten minute work close to the task area stops this and I end up moving more into the task or project with momentum.\n\nIn summary I notice this pattern too. I think for me vagueness comes partly from it not being defined in the scope, but also if it feels like you need to carry out some threshold task to define it. Such as needing to contact someone new or senior in the area the work is related to without a clear ask in order to find the information to define the task clearly. That is with me at least since I do not like seeking help or making new contacts (introverted perhaps) and an overly respectful attitude towards those much higher up the food chain than I!! Too busy to deal with me surely. An issue I have worked on a lot more over the last year or so.",

If there's something that you MUST recommend that costs money, I'd greatly appreciate it if it was under 10$/month or under 35$ if it's a one-time payment.\n* I greatly prefer media that is long-form content. Ideally 1-hour chunks so I can 'load' it before leaving and finish an entire 'episode.'\n\nRequests:\n\n* I would love to have an app that I can use to take voice notes while watching the aforementioned media.\n* I am still on the market for an actually decent transcriber app. The one I am using currently doesn't like my accent, and I would love to be able to say \"next line\" and \"period\" and have the thing actually do it.\n* Something semi-active for me to do once in a while would be great. (Obviously something that is safe to do while driving)\n* If there's ANY way to make any money it would be great; but I know that's a really high bar. \n\nGeneral Interests:\n\n* Money, Money Management and Investing.\n* Ideas for passive income\n* Marketing\n* Graphic Design\n* Drawing and Anime\n* Storytelling\n* Writing\n* Fantasy and Worldbuilding\n* Language Learning channels (Japanese and French specifically)\n* Table Top RPG's and how to make them\n\nAnd finally, in the interest of not burning myself out, I'd love to hear what you listen to for fun.\n\n",

For example, one week just negotiation, next week just investing basics. It reduces mental switching and makes the commute feel like a mini course.\n\nFor voice notes, I’ve had decent luck just using a simple recorder app and batching the transcription later instead of fighting live formatting. Trying to say “comma” and “next line” while driving would probably stress me out more than it helps. I’d separate capture from clean up.\n\nFor something semi active but safe, I like “mental reps.” After a podcast episode, I’ll summarize it out loud in my own words or imagine how I’d apply one idea to my current situation. It turns passive listening into processing without needing a screen.\n\nIf you want a money angle, you could document what you’re learning. Voice note summaries that later turn into short posts, essays, or even a niche newsletter. You’re already consuming the material, so you’re just extracting a second layer of value from it.\n\nAnd for fun, I rotate in storytelling podcasts or fantasy audiobooks so it doesn’t all feel like self optimization.

You can only pay attention to so much, and you don't want to get killed, or kill someone just because you tried to learn this fancy technique, right?\n\nIf you go for a paid audiobook subscription service, they often have good offers for starters, so it could well be within your budget. Great Courses for example are pretty cool to listen to.\nSome universities offer MOOC audio-content for free, and I also enjoy listening to podcasts. Podcast players often let you find whole university courses, lectures, free audio books in the public domain or just talks by professionals in audio format. \nA few people mentioned apps you can sign up via your library already. The content you can access there naturally depends on what your local library subscribes to - and you need a library card to sign up.",

          "text": "My suggestion has two part benefits, benefits for when driving, then benefits for when home. \n\nThe app “Waking Up” is centered on starting and improving your meditation practice. When you first get the app, it will suggest you start the 30 day (I think it’s 30 days, can’t remember exactly) meditation intro course. \n\nWhen I started the intro course, I had attempted meditation prior, but felt that “my ADHD won’t let me” and “my brain just talks too much and meditation isn’t for me”. By the time I had completed the entire intro course, I was meditating (using other offered guided meditations on the app) for 20+ mins a day, and I was seeing real improvements. I started the intro course probably six months ago, and am now meditating for about 45-60mins a day, and it’s truly changed my life. I’m so grateful I gave it an honest shot! The guided meditations offered on the app are all created and guided by actual “pro meditators”/monks/etc. NOT just actors and actresses reading from a script. That has been my biggest turn off from using other popular meditation apps, is that they just have “famous people” reading the guided meditations. The Waking Up app has only people who personally practice meditation or study Buddhist philosophy create and narrate their meditation sessions. \n\nThat being said, the meditation piece of the app would not be safe for driving! But would be great for once you get to your destination. I like doing a short 10 min meditation after I get off work and complete my hour drive home, but before I exit my car to walk to my apartment. It helps “divide” my day, signifying the end to my workday. \n\nThe second part of the app that would be useful for when driving, is all of the long-form audio the app offers. \n\nWaking Up has so much long-form content that spans so many subjects, under the general umbrella of “self improvement”. From talks with Buddhist monks, to neuroscientists explaining how plasticity in the brain works, to discussion topics on Stoicism, to talks on how to implement various forms of therapy into your everyday life (CBT, DBT, etc). The creator of the app is Sam Harris, a neuroscientist and meditation leader himself. All of the additional long-form audio content is ALL useful, and curated to where if you are someone with any interest in personal development and improving quality of life, you will really enjoy most of everything they have. \n\nThe app is usually $19.99 a month, however if you email the Waking Up app and request “financial assistance” due to not being able to afford the cost, they will give you a year subscription for free. At the end of that year, if you continue to need the financial assistance, just email and request again and you get another year. No limit on how many times to request assistance. \n\nThe Waking Up app is one of the very few apps to truly inspire and create change in my life. I am so grateful I gave it a shot, and I recommend it to everyone now. \n\nGood luck on your journey!",

I planned on cutting it off as its was feeding so much negativity to my head and add something else to fill that time. \n\nI wrap work around 7 PM and have dinner by 8 PM. I have about 7-8 hours after this for myself as I usually sleep late around 3-4 AM. My goal is to get to a point where I sleep by 12-1 at max, a topic for another day!\n\nI intended to use that time to upskill/work on side projects. My concern was that even with this 7-8 hours, I will be able to study for 2-3 hours at max as cognitive fatigue is real after work and few hours of study. I had no idea how was gonna fill the remaining \\~4 hours\n\n**How it turned out?**  \nOne week into this and the effects are massive. Surprisingly, negative too!!\n\n* I’ve been able to redcuce doom scrolling over the past week (Reddit, Twitter, etc) by \\~70–80%\n* I’m putting a few hours into studying after work. The issue is what comes after, once mental energy is depleted, anything cognitively demanding feels unrealistic so no space to dive into any hobby that is remotely demanding cognitively\n* **Loneliness kicked in** \\- Honestly, I didn't anticipate this to happen but in hindsight now I realize that  scrolling might be keeping my head occupied and making me avoid feeling lonely. I wasn't feeling like this before I started with this exercise a week back. The last \\~4h block that I refereed earlier is where I feel lonely which feels like a serious negative side effect of this at this point\n* Having said that, I’m optimistic this is temporary friction of me tapering myself down from doom scrolling. \n* Over the next few weeks, I plan to explore low effort, lighter activities that help unwind without reverting to doom scrolling or forcing productivity.\n\n\n\nCurious if others have experienced something similar and what helped?",

          "text": "Yeah, this actually makes a lot of sense. Doom scrolling wasn’t just “wasting time,” it was numbing things. When you remove it, whatever was being muted shows up. For you, that’s loneliness. A lot of people hit this phase and think something went wrong. It didn’t. You just took away a coping mechanism faster than you added a replacement.\n\nThat empty 3–4 hour block isn’t supposed to be productive. Treating it like it should be filled is what makes it heavier. After work + studying, your brain is done. That time is for low-stakes, low-pressure stuff. Loneliness doesn’t mean you need more people immediately. Sometimes it just means you need more presence. Things like walking outside with music, cooking slowly, journaling badly, watching one comfort show instead of endless clips. Stuff that keeps you company without frying your brain.\n\nAlso, some social input helps. Not deep conversations every night, just light human noise. A call with a friend once or twice a week, a gym class, Discord voice chat, even sitting in a café. Scrolling gave fake connection. You removed it, so your nervous system is like “hey, where did everyone go?” One important thing: don’t panic and reinstall doom scrolling to fix the loneliness. Sit with it a bit. This phase usually passes once your brain recalibrates and you build gentler evening rituals. You’re not regressing. This is what progress feels like when it’s not anesthetized.",

It’s almost like a countdown and usually takes me about 10 minutes. \n\nI think this helps me because I know there is an END to the cleaning… also, I’m a mom of a 3 and 5 year old so things become out of place VERY often. If you’re kid free then 100 might be too high of a number. Lol\n\nMy house stays so much more tidy this way! Hope this might be helpful to someone. 🫶🏻",

It works because it creates psychological resets.\n\nInstead of thinking “this whole day is overwhelming,” you think in blocks. Morning block. Midday block. Afternoon block. Evening block. Each one has its own tiny win condition. When one block ends, you mentally close it and start fresh.\n\nWhat’s helped me more than anything though is defining what makes a day successful before it starts. If everything feels important, your brain freezes. So I pick one primary task that, if done, makes the day a win. Everything else is secondary.\n\nAlso, when I feel like I’m drowning, it’s usually because my task list is unstructured. I’ll do a quick brain dump, then sort into three buckets: must do, should do, nice to do. Most of the stress drops once I see that not everything is urgent.\n\nAnother underrated tactic is setting a clear stop time. If there’s no boundary, work expands forever and you never feel caught up. A defined shutdown ritual helps your brain relax.\n\nIf you’re consistently overwhelmed, it might not be a tactics issue. It might be a volume issue. Sometimes productivity isn’t about squeezing more out of the day. It’s about cutting something.",

If I finish it, cool, that block was solid. The rest is extra. Otherwise you just spend the day moving things around and feeling busy but nothing really done. Been there.\n\nTimers help too. Not in a robotic way. Just 30 or 45 mins, phone away, do the thing. When it rings I stand up even if I don’t want to. It kind of resets your head. Like shaking an Etch A Sketch.\n\nAlso random but vague tasks are the worst. Work on business means nothing. Write 200 words means something. Your brain needs edges.\n\nMost days aren’t about being super productive anyway. It’s just about not spiralling. Keep it simple. Win small blocks. Repeat.",

Awake\n2. Asleep\n\nWithin the waking part of our day, I like to group things into 3 imaginary buckets:\n\n1. **Work** (job, school, chores, etc.)\n2. **Passion** (hobbies etc.)\n3. **Play** (unplug & do whatever)\n\nThis means:\n\n* I have a limited time budget each day, so I can't do *everything*\n* I have a limited energy budget each day, so I have to be selective about *what* I work on & *when* I work on it because my energy isn't always available\n* I have to be *selective* about which steps I choose to add to my day\n\nImagine a room with 2 items on the wall:\n\n1. A blank chalkboard\n2. A blank whiteboard\n\nThe title of the chalkboard is \"ROO Pressure\", which stands for:\n\n1. Responsibilities\n2. Opportunities\n3. Obligations\n\nThis creates \"emotional prioritization\", where we feel **pressured** to do things.  Instead, we can choose to use \"logical prioritization\", which is where we pick steps from the ROO chalkboard, or rather, manually approve what we choose to add to our personal whiteboard.  This allows us **vote** each item in by *choice*, not by *emotional pressure*.  The difference is:\n\n* We work on *selected steps*, NOT ideas\n* We select a finite number of steps in order to create a realistic daily schedule\n* WE dictate priority based on the order we put each step in.  Low priority = fewer steps later in the day; high-priority = more steps earlier in the day.  NOT based on how how much *emotional pressure* we are receiving internally!\n\nFour steps to task execution:\n\n1. Use reliable reminders (calendar entries, multiple named alarms, etc.)\n2. Have a clean, prepared workstation\n3. Use, literally, *written* tasks\n4. Use a body double (#1 productivity tool!!)\n\nImagine the opposite:\n\n* *Zero* written assignments\n* Exposure to ALL assignments (\"drinking from the firehose\" = overwhelming)\n* No preselected, finite list of tasks that can ne realistically achieved today (otherwise we create literally Failure Mode in our minds)\n* List not put in order of importance\n* No reminders\n* Messy workstation where the tools & supplies aren't ready to go\n* Work without the help needed to stay on track (working solo allows our brain to let us off the hook!)\n\nOur job is simply to manage OUR blank whiteboard:\n\n* What steps are we *willing* to vote into that blank space today?\n* Are we willing to *manually prioritize* via sequential ordering?\n* Are we willing to be **selective** about how many steps we pick each day, in order to create a realistically-achievable schedule?\n\nEvery project gets done by steps.  If we want to maximize our success, we need to choose HOW to be successful every day.  I unwittingly let **emotional prioritization** run my life for *most* of my life, simply because I didn't know HOW to do better!!",
