I spend so much time researching, planning and learning how to do things when I should just be doing\n\nI think the biggest problem are my emotions and how I feel before I have to do a task. For example, when I have to send an email, I often listen to what my emotions tell me about it, then make up an excuse in my head on why I can delay that particular task, and end up procrastinating for weeks until the deadline\n\nI don’t know what will help, will it be ashwaganda to stop me from feeling those emotions and just do it, or is it more a focus issue?",

          "text": "I don’t think this is a focus problem as much as an emotional avoidance loop. A lot of tasks aren’t hard, they just carry a tiny emotional charge, like uncertainty, self judgment, or the fear of doing it wrong. Research and planning feel productive because they let you stay in control without touching that discomfort. What helped me was shrinking tasks until they had almost no emotional weight, like opening the email draft without sending it, or writing one rough sentence. Once the task stops feeling like a verdict on you, action gets easier. I’d be careful about trying to numb the feelings away, because the signal is useful. The real shift for me was learning to act alongside the discomfort instead of waiting for it to disappear.",

When you only focus on the present moment (or, in this case, the present step of whatever you are doing), it becomes impossible to feel overwhelmed and the aversion for whatever you are trying to do will drop away.\n\nI have found benefits from taking it even further than what you are saying here. For example, instead of writing one rough sentence, I would only focus my awareness on writing a single letter at a time. But that takes a lot of practice to do well. And it can be done even better than that. If you get good enough, you just take each moment as it arrives. I can't do that consistently at all though haha.\n\nAnd this has been a colossal help for me, as someone with ADHD and that has previously had massive issues with procrastination.",

          "text": "I see this question asked a lot on this subreddit so here's some info I compiled from other users and my personal experiences.\n\n1. Shrink your tasks until it feels almost stupid not to start. When motivation is gone, stop asking yourself to “finish” anything. The goal is just to begin. I like to set a single Pomodoro (I use pomofocus.io) and tell myself I’m only working until the timer ends. Don't think about anything beyond that first cycle.\n2. Use habit contracts. One of the biggest takeaways from Atomic Habits is that habits stick when the cost of failure is immediate. You HAVE to pre-commit to a consequence before your future self tries to negotiate their way out of doing the thing. Habit contracts will be your best friend. I use Line (try-line.app) because I like having it on my computer, but I know there are also other mobile apps that do the same.\n3. Lower the bar for your success. A huge reason people quit is all-or-nothing thinking. Just because you miss one day or go halfway to your goal doesn't mean it's all over now. Consistency is better than intensity when it comes to long-term productivity, motivation, and discipline. Do something today that you'll thank yourself for tomorrow.\n\nYou got this!",

And then ok I’ll write the headers for the table too. At every step before I start it’s “nevermind let me just type something, doesn’t have to be perfect, if it’s wrong I will just refine it later”. Then somehow I finished the whole thing.\n\nSometimes I just write down all the things I have the option of doing that day. And I just force myself to pick the easiest one to do.",

It’s a trap because researching feels like progress, but it’s just a sophisticated way of avoiding the discomfort of starting.\n\nYou mentioned your emotions tell you to delay tasks. That happens because when a task list is vague or overloaded, your brain perceives it as a threat.\n\nWhat finally clicked for me was a radical shift to **extreme simplicity** based on the **80/20 Principle**.\n\nWe often forget that **80% of our results come from only 20% of our actions.** Most of the stuff on our \"infinite to-do lists\" is just noise that makes us anxious. Here is my framework now:\n\n1. **The Rule of 5:** I pick exactly 5 high-impact tasks per day. These are my \"20%\". If I have 20 things to do, I force myself to pick the 5 that actually move the needle.\n2. **Binary thinking:** I either \"Win\" the day (5/5) or I don't. It stops the emotional negotiation. When the target is that small, your brain stops panicking.\n3. **Visual Statistics:** I started tracking my \"Win streaks\" (Days -> Weeks -> Months). Seeing real data on when I’m actually winning vs. just being \"busy\" changed everything. It turns productivity into a game you don't want to lose.\n\nStop researching supplements and start shrinking your list until it's impossible to fail. That email you’re procrastinating on is probably one of those \"20%\" tasks—just do that, and you've already won most of your day.",

You already identified the real problem \"I listen to what my emotions tell me about it.\"\n\nThat pause between \"I should send this email\" and actually doing it.

They're just weather.\n\nI had this exact problem. What actually helped wasn't a system, it was having someone (or something) ask me \"what's the ONE thing today?\" every morning. Not a to-do list. A conversation that forced me to commit out loud to one thing.\n\nSounds stupid. But verbalizing \"I will do this task by 2pm\" to another person (or even an AI) makes the task feel more like a promise than a negotiation with yourself.\n\nI got so obsessed with this that I ended up building an app around it. Tell someone what you're going to do. The emotional resistance shrinks when there's a witness. The books and forums are procrastination dressed up as productivity. You already know enough.

          "text": "Your brain is hardwired to take the path of least effort. This was adaptive for survival. Energy is a costly resource to expend.\n\nThe trouble is, there are so many \"effortless rewards\" at our literal fingertips these days. \n\nAnd every time you get that thrill or pleasure at a reward, that's a dopamine spike that is essentially programming your brain. Get enough of these bad boys and the spike shifts from pleasure at the reward to anticipation of it at the cue. \n\nNow you have a different kind of spike occurring... one upstream that pulls you to the reward every time you come across it. See your phone -> urge to check. That's a cue spike. Think of your phone -> urge to check. That's a cue spike. Bored? Urge. Cue spike. Eating? Urge. Cue spike. \n\nBut the cool part is, the same mechanism that programmed your brain to feel COMPELLED to chase those rewards is the same mechanism that can be used to program your brain to feel DRIVEN to achieve your goals. \n\nYou can even look at it like a video game, where the final level is one in which you feel inbuilt motivation to just jump out of bed and DO the hard things.\n\nFor instance...\n\nThere are 3 levels of **l**earning you need to go through to integrate a new skill or habit or knowledge.\n\nIf you make it to level 3, the Hard Thing becomes automatic, in the sense that the motivation to do it is inbuilt and implicit. (It basically feels worse NOT to do it.)\n\nThe mechanism behind that inbuilt motivation is (funnily enough) a dopamine \"spike.\" But it isn't a spike of satisfaction at completion. It's a spike of prediction. The brain has learned what predicts the hard task and the spike of completion at the end of the task has shifted to a spike of anticipation, or motivation at the start of the task. It's a beautiful system and makes hard things feel easy... when you've levelled up this high.\n\nBut to get to level 3, you have to progress past 1 and 2.\n\nLevel 1 - The hard task feels hard because it is brand new and you have no inbuilt motivation to do it (besides some ephemeral desire to be the kind of person who does said hard task... but the brain can't make predictions based on desire, it needs receipts).\n\nBut if you can push through and stay in Level 1 for even just TEN minutes, you'll move to...\n\nLevel 2 - Your brain hasn't yet been shown enough evidence to shift the spike of motivation upstream for you BUT it can recognise that in the moment, the task is now a Real Thing and will temporarily increase tonic dopamine to support you. This is another form of motivation that makes it feel like you're \"in the zone.\" It will help you keep going and finish the hard task.\n\nThe tricky part is...\n\nNext time you do the hard task, you'll have to start at Level 1 again.\n\nBut if you're repeating the task every day (or at least a few times a week), it should theoretically take less and less time for you to get to Level 2 within a single session. You'll get \"in the zone\" faster and faster.\n\nWith enough repetitions, you'll eventually crack Level 3 and it will feel like you've just figured out the cheat code to life. Your brain will have integrated the hard task as part of who you are. You'll find it hard/uncomfortable not to do the task.\n\nAll the greats who achieve these amazing things aren't blessed with extra willpower – they've programmed it into their brains through repetition. They've created systems and repeated those systems so many times over that they're all operating at Level 3.\n\nDon't give up at Level 1. Level 3 is where things get easy, and life gets GOOD.\n\n(I write about this stuff in more detail on Substack if you want to understand the concept of dopamine engineering a little better. Link is in my profile if curious. Free. No strings attached. Just trying to pay it forward.)",

And at the end of the day, the actual task that mattered is still untouched.\n\nFor a long time I let myself believe this counted as productivity. At least I wasn’t *wasting time*, right? I was being busy. I was doing things. Everything looked cleaner and more organized, so it felt justified.\n\nBut it finally clicked that busy and effective are not the same thing.\n\nI noticed it one evening while I was playing jackpot city on my PC and taking a break between sessions. I realized I’d spent the entire day “preparing” to work, and none of that preparation had actually moved anything forward. I had just made avoidance look respectable.\n\nThe hard part is that productive procrastination feels good. It gives you the dopamine of motion without the discomfort of focus. There’s no risk, no resistance, no chance of failing at the real task. Just activity.\n\nOnce I started calling it what it is, it became harder to hide from myself. Now when I catch myself reorganizing instead of doing the thing I said mattered, I stop and ask whether this actually moves the needle or just makes me feel better.\n\nI still clean and organize. That stuff has its place. But I’m trying to be honest about when I’m doing it because it needs to be done, and when I’m doing it to avoid the work that actually counts.\n\nIt’s been uncomfortable, but also clarifying.

Some didn’t.  \nFelt great in theory, but execution still needed way more structure than just 1% better daily\n\nSo I’m curious:\n\n1. Did Atomic Habits actually change your behavior long-term?  \n2. Or did it just make you think more about habits?\n\nWhat’s your experience?",

Nothing special, I’d do a set of pull-ups midday, a set of pushups before my shower in the evening and a set of body weight squats in the shower. I did this for a year and used a habit tracker on my phone to keep me motivated. Even when I got sick, I still did my habits but maybe I went for fewer reps. \n\nI eventually turned that habit into a daily gym habit. Then I built a social circle there that further motivated me. Then my son got old enough to start joining me. Then my wife joined in too.\n\nNow everybody feels great about themselves and I could compete in amateur bodybuilding competitions if I wanted to.\n\nIt all started with that book. Small habits absolutely do compound and I’m now a huge advocate of how discipline to show up everyday absolutely trumps the surges of temporary motivation that most people rely on.",

Even if I didn’t feel like going to the gym, I would put the clothes on and then go about my business for another hour until it was gym time. Invariably, I would go because I was already dressed. Later, I was able to do away with that practice, but I still have days I don’t feel like going. On those days, I go anyway and tell myself there’s no expectation. I can go, lift for 15 minutes and then go home if I want. The funny thing is that it is often those days where I end up getting in really good workouts.

          "text": "There is a very interesting book called _The Power of Habit_ which goes into the science of habit and habit formation and how to use that information in rewiring maladaptive habits (ie, stress eating) or forming good habits. I read it around the same time as Atomic Habits and found they complemented each other really well and I highly recommend it. \n\nOne of the things the author discussed was a study on outcomes of patients who had undergone knee or hip replacement at an orthopedic hospital where the patient population leaned older, poorer, less educated, and their joints tended to be in worse shape. These surgeries also require a rigorous (read: painful) rehab schedule that you really have to adhere to in order to have a good outcome or else your new joints will fill with adhesions and not be as effective. They gave these patients booklets to write out their plans for their recovery alongside their rehab schedule. Patients who filled out the booklets had significantly better outcomes than the ones that didn't. They identified three main behaviors they thought drove the habit formation:\n\n1. They had a plan! They wrote down their goals and were specific about them. \"I am going to walk to the bus stop Tuesday afternoon to meet my wife on her way home\".\n\n2. Their plan included contingency plans for when they hit roadblocks. \"I will go to the gym tomorrow. If I don't feel like going to the gym, I will go anyway. If I still don't feel like it when I am there, I will jog for half a mile at a conversational pace and then go home.\" And boom, the habit of going to the gym gets reinforced. \n\n3. They defined rewards for getting over the hump. Bus stop guy got to see his wife, other subjects would position candy throughout the house that they were allowed to eat only if they got their under their own power, etc. You need to reward yourself in order to strengthen habits. \n\nI strongly recommend reading it. It's a good companion to Atomic Habits (and appears a few times in the endnotes IIRC).",

I think what you’re calling out is that once you’re on the highway, you either need a really good sense of self-direction, or you need some other map to get you where you are trying to go.  Fair point. 👍🏻\n\nFWIW I’ve successfully applied Atomic Habits by focusing hard on the “build better systems” aspect.  The same way I needed a system to quit smoking, I also needed one (a very different one) to lose weight, and then yet another one to level up professionally.  The novel idea (to me) of focusing on system-building instead of cold-turkeying or sheer-willpowering my way thru the change (as I had so many times before) made the difference between “life hack” and “lifestyle change” for me.",

That can be hard to accept when life feels complex and overwhelming, but simplicity creates clarity, and clarity matters more than almost anything when you’re trying to change behavior.\n\nAlso remember who this framework is really for. For many people, it’s an entry point. When life gets messy, slipping into habits isn’t a failure; it’s part of the build. You’re still practicing the system.\n\nIt’s easy to do habits on good days and hard on bad ones, but that’s true of any process. The point is that the good days are training. You build the habit when it’s easy so you’re better equipped when it’s not.\n\nAnd as for whether it just makes you “think about habits”, every habit starts that way. Nothing is automatic at first. Thinking about it is part of the transition from intentional action to something that eventually becomes part of daily life.",

          "text": "What changed my behaviour was actually understanding the mechanics behind habits.\n\nIf your brain is a program, dopamine is the programming language.\n\nDopamine spikes of thrill or pleasure are the ones that program your brain. Dopamine spikes of prediction and anticipation are the ones that run those programs.\n\nYou can even look at it like a video game, where the final level is one in which you feel inbuilt motivation to just jump out of bed and DO the hard things.\n\nFor instance...\n\nThere are 3 levels of **l**earning you need to go through to integrate a new skill or habit or knowledge.\n\nIf you make it to level 3, the Hard Thing becomes automatic, in the sense that the motivation to do it is inbuilt and implicit. (It basically feels worse NOT to do it.)\n\nThe mechanism behind that inbuilt motivation is (funnily enough) a dopamine \"spike.\" But it isn't a spike of satisfaction at completion. It's a spike of prediction. The brain has learned what predicts the hard task and the spike of completion at the end of the task has shifted to a spike of anticipation, or motivation at the start of the task. It's a beautiful system and makes hard things feel easy... when you've levelled up this high.\n\nBut to get to level 3, you have to progress past 1 and 2.\n\nLevel 1 - The hard task feels hard because it is brand new and you have no inbuilt motivation to do it (besides some ephemeral desire to be the kind of person who does said hard task... but the brain can't make predictions based on desire, it needs receipts).\n\nBut if you can push through and stay in Level 1 for even just TEN minutes, you'll move to...\n\nLevel 2 - Your brain hasn't yet been shown enough evidence to shift the spike of motivation upstream for you BUT it can recognise that in the moment, the task is now a Real Thing and will temporarily increase tonic dopamine to support you. This is another form of motivation that makes it feel like you're \"in the zone.\" It will help you keep going and finish the hard task.\n\nThe tricky part is...\n\nNext time you do the hard task, you'll have to start at Level 1 again.\n\nBut if you're repeating the task every day (or at least a few times a week), it should theoretically take less and less time for you to get to Level 2 within a single session. You'll get \"in the zone\" faster and faster.\n\nWith enough repetitions, you'll eventually crack Level 3 and it will feel like you've just figured out the cheat code to life. Your brain will have integrated the hard task as part of who you are. You'll find it hard/uncomfortable not to do the task.\n\nAll the greats who achieve these amazing things aren't blessed with extra willpower – they've programmed it into their brains through repetition. They've created systems and repeated those systems so many times over that they're all operating at Level 3.\n\nDon't give up at Level 1. Level 3 is where things get easy, and life gets GOOD.\n\n(I write about this stuff in more detail on Substack if you want to understand the concept of dopamine engineering a little better. Link is in my profile if curious. Free. No strings attached. Just trying to pay it forward.)",

While that has been valuable I realize I am lacking in many other areas that could compound over time especially skills related to career growth money communication and personal discipline.\n\nI am trying to identify skills that provide a strong long term return on investment whether that return shows up as better job opportunities financial stability confidence or overall quality of life. I am open to both hard skills such as technical business or creative skills and soft skills such as communication emotional regulation habits and mindset.\n\nI would really appreciate insights from people who are further along in life or their careers. What skills ended up paying off the most for you over time? Which skills do you wish you had started learning earlier in your 20s? Are there any skills you invested time in that turned out to be overrated or less useful than expected?\n\nI am not looking for shortcuts just guidance on where consistent effort over the next few years would matter most.

I had to learn to code because I started studying finance and creating applications related to my stock trading.\n\nCoding × whatever area you want to impact = CA$H\n\nSo lets say you learn to code. Other people will use you for your ability to code. That's called a job. The people who pay you will use your code in other areas of life, like science or art or even regular chores.\n\nIf you can gain ideas/skills in something you are also passionate about like let's say dancing. You can make applications for dancers to help them learn/perform or solve whatever problem they have. How do you know what dancers need? You have to be an insider. A dancer too! You just married your skills and solved a problem! Exponential returns. People will thank you in the form of money.\n\nYou need to understand the problems other people are having and solve those problems with your own set of skills. You are paid in proportion to how big the problems you fix are.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to coding btw. If I'm a gym goer and a psychologist. How can physical fitness help my mental health? Married 2 skills again. And it goes on and on.\n\nHope it helps :)",

Clear communication, writing simply, and being able to explain ideas to non technical people mattered way more than another tool or language. That’s what actually unlocked better jobs and trust.\n\nThe second one was personal discipline around health and money. Sleep, lifting or some form of training, cooking, and not living paycheck to paycheck gave me energy and confidence that spilled into everything else. It sounds basic but most people never lock this in, so the ones who do pull ahead quietly.\n\nOne thing I wish I’d started earlier was deliberately practicing communication. Writing regularly, public speaking even if it’s uncomfortable, and learning how to give and receive feedback without getting defensive. That skill shows up everywhere, relationships, work, leadership.\n\nOverrated for me were grinding niche tools without context. I spent time learning things that felt productive but didn’t actually move my leverage forward because they weren’t paired with real problems or people.\n\nIf you keep stacking core skills, communication, health, financial basics, and one strong technical track, the compounding is very real by your late 20s. You’re already asking the right questions.\n\nThat should land well, feel human, and invite upvotes and replies instead of sounding like a lecture.",

A lot of people do that, but it’s not ideal.\n\nYou should spend your time becoming really great at CS. By “really great,” I mean reading the best books on current topics, doing your own research, etc. This will lead you to knowledge that almost none of your classmates will ever learn.\n\nAnother thing people don’t consider is that many successful people already knew a lot beforehand and had an idea in their respective fields. Sometimes, a hint from a conversation with someone is enough to turn a key in their projects or mindset. To make this clearer, let me give an example: Zuckerberg already knew how to code—imagine if he didn’t (and there are many other examples, like McAfee).\n\nPeople usually imagine a goal and then learn the requirements to achieve it while trying to accomplish it. I myself learned how to code while dreaming about my dream game. While this is a great strategy to learn something new, it’s not ideal for accomplishing something huge, because the lack of knowledge slows things down. (My dream game took so long that I eventually quit.)\n\nThere is a quote: if you want to chop down a tree in 10 hours, you should spend most of that time preparing and sharpening your tools. That means when the time to chop the tree comes, you will already have everything you need.\n\nTL;DR: Get better at what you’ll be spending your time on in the future.",

      "text": "When I sat down to study, I knew exactly what needed to be done. Dozens of chapters needed revision. Many topics needed clarification. There were clear academic priorities in front of me.\n\nYet, instead of studying, I found myself endlessly scrolling on YT, social media, or searching for that one perfect video that would suddenly make me productive. I kept consuming motivation and study hacks, hoping something would finally click.\n\nThis went on for months.\n\nThen I realised that Most online motivation and productivity hacks only work when your mind is already relatively focused. They do not create focus. They only amplify it if it already exists.\n\nMy mind, however, was constantly preoccupied by social media, FOMO, thoughts of parties, new web series, and what others were doing. In that state, no amount of motivation could help.\n\nWhen I started meditation and yoga, something interesting happened. A question arose very clearly in my mind.\n\nWhy do I suddenly feel the urge to check social media, watch a web series, or go out with friends only when I sit down to study?\n\nThat question led me to the root of my problem.\nMy mind was already filled with impressions I had fed it earlier. Every time I gave in to an urge to scroll, delay work, or escape discomfort, I strengthened that pattern. Over time, my mind learned to trick me into believing that those distractions were more important than my actual priorities.\n\nThis, I realized, was the real cause of my procrastination.\nMeditation didn't brought disciplin. What it did was far more important. It gave me a pause.\n\nThat pause changed everything.\n\nInstead of immediately giving in to an urge, I could observe it. Instead of reacting compulsively, I could remind myself of what actually mattered. In that small moment of awareness, I could make a conscious choice.\n\nYoga and meditation together helped me shift from automatic behavior to conscious action. Meditation brought mental clarity,  while yoga helped my body stay energetic. As I continued both practices, my daytime tiredness gradually reduced. Earlier, I would feel sleepy and dull while studying. Now, I remain alert and fresh for long study sessions without that constant urge to lie down or escape.\n\nSlowly, the distracting loop weakened. I stopped delaying important work. I stopped negotiating with my mind. For the first time, I was able to actually complete my tasks without any resistance.\n\nAnd also I cleared the initial stages of competitive exams in just 2-3 months of focused studies, ofcourse the latter stage weren't that good but clearing those initial stages gave me confidence with clarity that I could do much more , this really felt impossible earlier.\n\n“Once you go beyond the compulsive, cyclical nature of existence, life becomes spectacular.”\n-Sadhguru\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTL;DR\nI knew what I had to study but kept procrastinating through scrolling and searching for motivation. I realized that motivation only works when the mind is already focused. Meditation helped me pause instead of reacting to urges, while yoga gave me sustained energy. Together, they broke my procrastination loop, improved clarity, and helped me complete tasks and clear initial stages of competitive exams with confidence.",

It always sounded obvious, but I never actually committed to it. My usual routine was: open laptop, skim emails, clear a few tiny to dos, and promise myself I’d dive into the big project in a bit. Spoiler: I almost never did.\n\nA couple of months ago I finally decided to give it a real shot. I picked one big project I’d been avoiding for months and made a simple rule for myself: one hour every morning, first thing, before checking messages or touching anything else. Just sixty minutes of focused work.\n\nThe first week was rough. My brain really wanted the easy dopamine of emails and small tasks. But after a few days, it started to feel different. That one focused hour kind of anchored the whole day. Once I pushed through the hardest thing upfront, everything afterward felt lighter and more manageable. Three weeks later, the project I’d been dragging my feet on for ages was finished.\n\nLast night I was on my phone playing jackpot city and spacing out, and it hit me how much less mentally heavy my workload feels now. Same job, same tasks, but that tiny routine change completely shifted how I approach my day. It even made me notice how I handle other small rewards too, like when I mess around with Mistplay to earn points from random mobile games and trade them in for the occasional Amazon gift card as a little post frog treat. \n\nAt this point, eat the frog is basically my default setting: do the hard thing first, and the rest of the day kind of feels like bonus time.",

First couple team meetings tho it got weirdly awkward. People kept glancing at them even tho I wasnt recording anything. You could just feel that \"wait is he recording us?\" vibe. After 3-4 meetings I stopped bringing them cause it was affecting the actual conversations.\n\nTried those recording pen things too but honestly carrying another device that needs charging felt like it defeated the purpose. I already wear glasses everyday so something that just replaces those made the most sense to me.\n\nEventually switched to audio-only smart glasses for meetings without cameras. Found some called dymesty that have a titanium frame which feels pretty solid, kinda reminds me of my old lindberg frames. They just look like regular glasses which is exactly what I needed.\n\nThe transcription spits out meeting summaries and action items which actually saves me a ton of time going back thru notes later. Battery lasts a few days so its pretty low maintainence.\n\nObvious tradeoff is no video capture which would be useful sometimes for whiteboard sessions or demos. But honestly having people act natural in meetings matters way more for actually getting work done.\n\nWhat tools have actually stuck for you guys? Voice recorders? Note taking apps? Im curious what ended up being genuinley useful vs just creating more friction in your workflow.",

My experience IRL: a meeting usually has anywhere zero-two pages worth of actual noteworthy info to record. \n\nI started years back with recording everything in handwriting, which is fast-ish and extremely flexible (sometimes a few sketchy arrows or some weird shaped squiggle can save a few lines of text). All that served was a memory aid, which I’d then turn into real, distilled meeting notes. Some info became tasks, some became appointments, some became emails, very small amounts became long-term info to (catalogue in a super easily findable, effortless system) keep long term. \n\nIf i waited a few hours, the paper-to-final would lose quality. 2-3 days later, was still a “pass”, but longer would usually mean my original notes are about half as useful. \n\nThe “trick” is … experience. Which allows you to half-process in real time what’s going to end up becoming a task, calendar, eml, data, etc. and either create those in real time, or jot down the essence of what those would contain. \n\nAlso, helps to make it imperative (by gently and timely bringing convo back on track when it slips off) for group to reach decisions or declare actions (with owner <- VITAL VITAL VITAL, a due date (or date for status update, by whom, to whom), and these derived actions need be super **clear** actions, which are a no brainer to know whether they were indeed done or neglected …and done/neglected by whom). \n\nWhen a decision/action cant be reached, group must either consciously decide the idea is not going to happen, or (if further info is required to decide), a decision when this item is due for discussion/resolution. I know that’s not exactly about note taking, but it is critical: a. To reduce useless meeting time and useless notes that do nothing IRL and b. a focused meeting leads to clarity what is going to become a task/appointment/email/another meeting/etc.\n\n**Tldr: dont just record every utterance made; rather keep asking “so what?”, and not the answer to that. Capture meaningful info, not raw data.**\n\nThese days, i just write an email to myself during the meeting, subject is “meeting with x about y”.  I try to understanding what needs to be done if at all about everything being said and just create tasks and cal appointments on the fly, even write short emails if those are the desired outcome of any exchange of words (eg if we’re talking about considering an equipment purchase, I’ll just email the vendor to request a quote for the equipment, takes < 1-2 min). **Only what cant easily be done on the fly** becomes a bullet point (hopefully) or a short paragraph (if all else fails; with key words bolded). End of meeting, email sent. These email-notes-to-self usually end up anywhere zero to 10 bullets.\n\nI get back to office. Asap: turn what’s left in that email to self into tasks/cal/immediate action/schedule follow up meetings/etc.",

Like many others, an audio recording has worked well for me in the past and I've always asked, \"Is it ok if I record\" and always get a yes though as others have said this isn't appropriate in every situation. One problem is that I'm essentially setting myself up to sit through the meeting twice (at 2x speed but still..) I've come to realize that I'm faster and more accurate typing my notes than I am writing them so I always try to do that whenever possible and have the format preset so that I have a place within my document to put to-dos and decisions in real time. If I have to write I have shorthand things like putting boxes around the to-dos/decisions (always with due dates) if they end up not in a list for some reason.Your role in the notetaking makes a difference too -am I taking notes while also running the meeting? That makes it a little easier to steer the conversation towards the exact topics and info that I'm looking for. Other times there's brainstorming and meandering before arriving at a decision (some of which is relevant to include and some not) so I do feel myself basically transcribing a meeting sometimes before the it becomes clearer which parts are important. I try to be prepared to highlight to-dos quickly so I can format them more clearly after the meeting and use strikethroughs, or greying out, something I can do fast that tells me that this part is outdated or less important and I can quickly polish the notes afterward (with or without the recording). By no means a perfect system, but the main thing I've learned is I do not rely on having a clear remembrance of the convo, as I've caught myself being wrong too many times. So, I try to clean the notes asap and definitely the same day.",

I’ve seen the same thing with cameras, bots announcing they’re transcribing, or people typing nonstop — it pulls everyone out of the room.\n\nWhat’s actually stuck for me is keeping it boring and invisible. Either audio-only capture (with clear consent once, not every meeting), or very light manual notes focused only on decisions + next actions. I don’t try to capture everything anymore. If a tool makes me manage batteries, devices, or awkward social dynamics, it’s a net loss, no matter how “smart” it is.\n\nThe big tradeoff you mentioned is real. Video is nice for whiteboards, but natural conversation beats perfect records every time. Anything that reduces friction during the meeting usually ends up saving more time after the meeting.

If people feel recorded, meetings get worse.\n\n\n\nOne approach that’s stuck for me is separating the workflow into two parts:\n\n\n\n1) Capture (lowest-friction)\n\n\\- If the room vibe matters, I keep capture minimal: quick rough notes during the call, and I only use a transcript when everyone explicitly expects it (like sales demos / recorded calls).\n\n\n\n2) Turn it into execution (where most tools fail)\n\nThe win isn’t “better notes”, it’s a follow-up that makes work happen:\n\n\\- Decisions\n\n\\- Action items (owner + due date)\n\n\\- Open questions\n\n\\- Next steps\n\n\n\nThat’s exactly what I use MeetDone for: you paste meeting notes (or a transcript you already have) and it generates a send-ready follow-up email in that structure. It doesn’t record or transcribe anything itself — it just formats what you already have into something actionable.\n\n\n\nCurious: are your smart glasses giving you raw transcripts, or are they also generating the structured follow-up with owners + due dates?",

I am on a consumer proposal to pay off my debt in 5 yrs. Yesterday I was let go from my job. It came out of nowhere. I will get 6 weeks severance & 6 weeks of health benefits. I am going to start looking for a job next week & my goal is to find something by end of Feb. I felt like I finally had everything going for me & I was so motivated to get my life on track. Now I feel like that someone pulled the rug beneath me. Please give me some motivation & advice. I can't give up now. I have people telling me ro move to another city in Canada & even Dubai to make money. I have always wanted to start my own online business or freelance. I feel like I am frozen & I have no clue what to do. I am good to work till 70. I just want to be financially stable. I an going to fill up my time with job search, networking, gym, eating clean & volunteering. Is there anything else I can do to make use of my time in between jobs?",

          "text": "So sorry about this. \n1. Looking at your plan I would also add a daily learning/mastery plan of 2 hrs/day to upskill and make yourself marketable, starting with quick wins, the low-hanging fruit … choosing things to learn that are easy and quick to pick up but will yield high payoffs in terms of significantly improving your job prospects and future work effectiveness. \n\n2. Research is highly important for experienced professionals as you likely have multiple sought after skills - hard and soft. \n\nIt is mandatory to start only after we are clear about what we want to do/where u want to work next, our  sweet spot and the best-paying job segments that we can address with our skills. And only then, hit the ground daily starting with networking/applying for jobs. It would also drive the quality of networking outcomes. Then you will be able to not only find more opportunities but be able to confidently interview better and convert those opportunities into jobs. You would be able to articulate with confidence your sweet spot. \n\nIn this market be narrow, specific and relevant in your reachout so people who want to help can understand your ‘sweet spot’ better and provide you leads on your expertise areas, where u want to go and what u want to do. \n\nOnce the research is done it’s more about  plan for a quick start - and refine the target companies list daily based on what the companies and jobs are finding interesting, what your network is leading u to, and where you are finding more nibbles based on where you are casting. \n\n3. Aim to hit daily goals and be consistent. There is no certainty when the search will bear fruition. end of Feb - could be sooner or later - but there is full certainty in attaining daily networking reachouts, daily learning, daily activities u control and which maximize your chances for success. \n\n4. Finally, follow some career coaches daily on YouTube. I don’t know your line of work. I like Andy La Civita on YT, see if he resonates. (Disclaimer: I am only a fan, not associated with his business)  \n\n5. One opinion -  a small paid gig instead of volunteering when between jobs might be a better route, esp if it’s easy to get one, eg, from your network. But If you find u are spending as much time looking for a part-time as a full-time job. Then that’s not a route to take, and nor is volunteering. \n\nBest to be cautious about volunteering. it can can guzzle time, and signal your willingness to  accept low-value work - u can always volunteer after u land a job, if your motivation is to give back to society. \n\nRight now, u are vulnerable, I’d rather u spend time with high-value activities - attending meetups, learning events, meeting other professionals and learning about their companies/culture/what’ their companies are hiring for, self-care etc. I have volunteered seriously while out of a job, and feel incredibly proud of my contribution. But it seriously hurt perceptions and also time available for my job search \n\n You already have many skills, and a small humble paid job a few hrs a week (without taking time from job search and study) will keep you in action, bring continuity or work experience in your resume, pay some bills without tiring u out, signal u r flexible and nimble on your feet, and keep u in touch with people and in good mental health - so, so, important if one lives alone.\n\nGood luck! You will land - take baby steps, get into action fast. I see your comments and u got this! \n\nThe longer u wade in the shallows the harder it will get. If you land a job quickly, u will save your severance and come ahead. And rather  than ice-cream when you also wanted go hit the gym, I’d dance and watch comedies and cartoons everyday to keep me smiling :)",

Don’t over optimise it or you’ll freeze. You don’t need a huge plan, just enough structure so the days don’t blur together.

Get natural sunshine (if there) in your eyes and take a short walk. It signals your biological clock to stay awake better than willpower can.\n2. **The Caffeine Timing:** If you drink coffee right when you wake up, that might be causing the afternoon crash. Huberman suggests waiting 60-90 minutes after waking up before your first cup. This prevents the \"adenosine crash\" that hits you right around the time you get home.\n3. **The Power Nap:** If you are exhausted, set a timer for **15 minutes max**. It sounds short, but it clears the mental fog without letting you enter deep sleep. If you sleep longer than 20 minutes, you'll wake up even groggier (sleep inertia).\n\nFor sure do not lay in bed scrolling: your brain associates that position with sleep.",

It is possible that your sleep hygiene has changed (maybe you use more screen time before bed, maybe you've started eating or drinking before sleeping, etc), or that the quality of your sleep as changed (mattress, pillows, temperature, sleep apnea), hence why you feel different dispite sleeping the same hours.",

It doesn't sound good because this could often be 9pm or 10pm at night when you get done, but I would have rather built that discipline rather than hang out with friends which doesn't do much to improve your life. You also always have the weekends to hang out with them anyway.\n\nTrust me, unless something drastic changes like you somehow fix your sleep schedule or get some medication, just accept the nap for what it is and take care of business after. You'll thank yourself later in life when you've built this discipline of getting things done over procrastinating or indulging in pleasures.

Switching tasks is actually detrimental to productivity to the point that it is better to literally sit and do nothing if you need to wait a couple of minutes.\n\nPomodoro works great for a couple of reasons. It forces breaking down tasks and mandates breaks. But newcomers often start scrolling social media during the break which is almost like switching task and very draining...\n\nHard to say.\n\nMy biggest \"aha\" moment in productivity journey is to start identifying problems and applying solutions instead of trying random techniques.",

I don't play sports and I don't like it. I can only go out with my friends on weekends because they are very busy, and that makes me feel like a failure. I don't spend much time on social media, but I sleep a lot in the afternoon, then I study and play bass (but I only do it for an hour). I also have a band, but we never rehearse because everyone else is busy. I don't like reading because I haven't discovered a literary genre that I'm passionate about yet. I'd like to learn to cook, but I've failed at a couple of recipes and have given up hope. I like movies, but I can't afford a subscription. I also need money, so I tried putting up flyers to become a dog walker, but no one has called me. Having so much free time makes me think too much, and I feel like I'm wasting my time. I also feel tired and sleepy all the time. Have you ever felt this way? Is it normal? How do you get over it? what could I do?",

If you can't afford it there is always the \"sail the seas method 🏴‍☠️\" also known as pirating (here in Italy they don't care and it's easy)...\n\nI'd also suggest to study something you personally like or want to get ahead with, for me it's computer science.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that if u try to learn something that doen't reward you a lot or takes a lot of time/effort (ex. Photoshop, programming, learning how to do splits) it can be really hard to be motivated, especially if you are doing it alone (all my friends have 0 hobbys/interests...). In this case i would say don't force it and try another thing.\n\nAnd make sure that everything you try you are doing it for fun or interest, otherwise it won't last long (just the initial boost of confidence).\n\nTalking about finance i would say that it's not worth it to work for a couple of bucks, instead i suggest learning to avoid impulse-purchases, tracking your money and these simple things and you'll already be ahead.\n\nAs an overthinker myself i'm always unsatified and thinking about my potential if i used every second \"efficiently\". I'll say you don't have to be so hard on yourself and don't stress too much, try to enjoy life as much as you can, it's already a lot that you think about being productive and not wasting time, remember that we are teens.\n\nNever wrote this much, i've done it bc your post made me reflect about myself too, hope this helps!",

      "text": "Productivity is directly related to focus.\n\nFocus (Hyperfocus) is the sweet flow state we all love.\n\nEverything changed a couple of months ago, when I learned that you can practice meditation to improve focus. Doom scrolling and social media mess up your dopamine system, and after uninstalling social media apps, I wanted a way to reverse the damage, i.e., decreased attention span and focus.\n\nI also learned that it's natural to lose focus during meditation because your mind tends to get bored and wander. The benefit comes from refocusing after being distracted, as it strengthens your neurological pathways for maintaining focus.\n\nEvery night before I go to sleep, I set an alarm and meditate. I started with 3 minutes (my atomic habit), increased to 5 minutes a few months later, and now I'm at 10 minutes. Nothing fancy, just focusing on my breathing.\n\nI once did a 17-minute session focused on my breathing and interoception because I heard that a single session could permanently rewire your brain.\n\nI've been meditating for about 6 months, and I'm definitely more productive.\n\n",

Boring but it works.\n\nBig change for me was cutting phone use in the mornings. No socials until I’ve done one real task. Doesn’t always happen but when it does the day just feels easier. I also stopped making huge to do lists. I pick one main thing per day and that’s it. Anything else is a bonus.\n\nStill distracted sometimes. Especially when I’m tired.

I started watching movies again and honestly, I’m turning into a cinephile. Planning to watch a new movie every weekend like my own tradition for myself. It’s been fun searching for a movie i like - watching and then reflecting on it. Regarding books,I am currently reading 1984 - done till part 2/3. I am planning to read classics in 2026. I wish to know more about the past so will take up history non fiction next. I went to an art exhibition and i realised i like spending time watching and learning from art. \n\nI have been, however, struggling with maintaining a balance between these new hobbies and my work/studies. Its good to know barely a month has passed because i wish to try more new things out. I do wish to go out on weekend, specially spend my Sunday out of bed-perhaps visiting art exhibitions? However, not planned anything concrete yet. My next task is to recognise/get a routine so i could perhaps continue with my hobbies while not feeling guilty of being “non productive”.  Later on in the year, i might start with my goals regarding my health and my social network but that will take a lot of motivation/courage tbh.",

My bestfriend bought me an instax poloroid camera last night. I am beyond happy- it was on my wishlist of 2026. \n\n\nI am trying each day to not fall into my old habits of self doubt and not feeling sufficient. I have now started believing in \"whatever happens must be gods plan\" and that truly does bring me a lot of peace. So to sum it all up i think i am doing okay. I cant wait to see what 2026 will have in store for me",
