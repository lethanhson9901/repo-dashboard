      "text": "I'm in this cycle. And I hate myself for it.\n\nI'll start my essay at 7pm, but 11:58pm rolls around and I'm still on Reddit. Not because I'm procrastinating. Not because I don't care. Because starting feels impossible when it has to be perfect. So I do nothing instead.\n\nPeople say \"just start earlier\" like I'm not trying. I have due dates marked. I have reminders set. I tell myself tonight's the night. And somehow I'm still at 11:59pm panicking, wondering where the time went, hating myself for being such a failure.\n\nThe worst part is the shame spiral. Because now I'm not just behind - I'm a disappointment. To myself. To everyone. So tomorrow I tell myself I'll be different. I'll be disciplined. Tomorrow never comes.\n\nMy girlfriend watched this happen over and over. She didnt call me lazy like I do, she asked a simple question: why does it all have to happen tonight?\n\nI didn’t have a good answer.\n\nShe helped me realize I wasn’t failing because I was lazy. I was failing because I kept telling myself it had to be perfect or it didn’t count. So I did nothing. Her suggestion was almost embarrassingly small: what if tonight I just wrote one paragraph?\n\nI opened the document and wrote one messy, incomplete paragraph. I didn’t submit it. I didn’t finish the assignment. But I did something. And that was enough to break the cycle. The shame didn’t hit the same way.\n\nShe called it “non-zero day”. It is when you do literally anything toward your goal no matter how small it is.\n\nThe worst moments were when shame crept back in and I wanted to quit. She’d just say: did you do something today? then it was a non-zero day. that’s enough.\n\nI’d never heard those words before. Not about myself.\n\nOnce I stopped aiming for perfect and aimed for something, that voice in my head got quieter. Now when procrastination creeps in, I don’t think about doing everything. I ask myself: what’s one small thing I can do right now? And I do that. And somehow, that’s been enough to keep me moving.\n\nMy girlfriend didn't fix me. She just helped me see I didn't need fixing.\n\nThat changed everything.\n\ntl;dr- My girlfriend taught me about \"non-zero days\": doing literally anything toward your goal is enough. It broke the perfectionism cycle. That one concept rewired how I see myself.",

If I have other important things to do, I set a timer for my task and/or those other things (and make sure I have a basic list of those things).\n\nWhen I don't do this or similar helpful things, I end up putting the majority of the task off and then hurrying near the deadline.

The list lives in my head, gets heavier and heavier, and then I freeze.\n\nA few weeks ago my boyfriend noticed this pattern and offered to help. He literally sits with me and says one step at a time what to do, and I just do it. If I hesitate or start drifting, he breaks it down even smaller until there’s zero thinking required on my end.\n\nAt first I felt kind of silly needing this level of hand-holding, but wow it works way better than anything I’ve tried. There’s something incredibly calming about not having to decide what to do next. I just follow instructions like a NPC and suddenly I’m getting stuff done.\n\nWhen I procrastinate, it’s never because the task is hard. It’s because my brain gets overwhelmed by all the invisible steps. \n\nWhat surprised me most is how efficient it feels. Tasks that used to take an entire afternoon of avoidance + guilt now get done in like 30 minutes. And I don’t end the day exhausted from decision-making.",

              "text": "This is a great comment and I appreciate you bringing up Professor Smith. You are absolutely right—if the goal is purely overcoming Sleep Inertia (that groggy feeling immediately upon waking), the literature supports immediate caffeine intake. Smith’s work is solid there.\nHowever, the protocol I mentioned (supported by Dr. Matthew Walker and others) is optimizing for a different variable: Preventing the afternoon crash.\nThe mechanism is Adenosine Kinetics. Since caffeine blocks adenosine receptors without actually clearing the chemical, drinking it immediately upon waking \"traps\" the residual sleep pressure from the night before. When the caffeine wears off, that residual adenosine floods the receptors alongside the new adenosine built up during the day, leading to a harder crash in the afternoon.\nIt’s a trade-off. If you need to be alert right now, drink it immediately. If you want to avoid the crash at 2 PM, the delay allows for natural clearance first.\nHere is the research on the adenosine/caffeine interaction mechanism if you want to dig in: https://ai.hubermanlab.com/d/a0955576-4eba-11ee-8dc0-c7cb6ee09013?t=3-Understanding+Sleep+Pressure",

You could do it on the chair and then focus on breathing in and out. Almost in line with the coherent breathing as above. \n\nIf there is a thought, for example a pink elephant rather than go with the thought towards zoo, Safari and then travel and then associated other persons in the thought process. You just need to appreciate the pink elephant come back to breathing with a smile. This is a small win but Powerful. \n\nWhat you're essentially doing is not to go with the thoughts but come back to observe your breathing which is your focal point and the focus improves as you do it more but consistently on a daily basis. \n\nI used to do guided meditations but then everything boils down to what I described above which is focusing on breathing. So now I do it without any guidance or music.. \n\nTime can be varied from person to person and from initial phases of practise. \n\nRather than keep time I just sit as long as I can get up document the time and then try to beat it tomorrow but without timers or alarms because I kind of become conscious of the alarms to go off and then panic inside that I haven't done it well.. \n\nHope it goes well.

I noticed that when I stopped doomscrolling, even simple things like planning my day started feeling satisfying instead of tedious. Like my brain recalibrated what counts as a reward.\n\nThe \"I only need 6 hours\" myth is everywhere. I used to say it too.

          "text": "It's important to understand that burnout doesn't simply dissipate over time. In fact, the underlying stressors that contribute to burnout, such as demanding workloads, unhealthy habits, and unrealistic expectations, often persist. When you rest, your batteries recharge a bit, but if you plug them back into the exact same system (same pace, same digital distractions, same lack of boundaries), they drain just as fast again.\n\nIt has been suggested that a more effective approach might be to view burnout as a process issue rather than a matter of willpower.\n\nIt might be beneficial to consider a systematic approach to reducing \"invisible\" cognitive load, which could include elements such as constant context switching, open loops, and unfinished tasks.\n\nOne approach that may be worth considering is to design your day around 2–4 truly high-impact blocks of focus. This would be an alternative to trying to be \"on\" all day.\n\nProtecting recovery as a non-negotiable input to performance, rather than a reward when everything is done (because in knowledge work, it's never \"all done\").\n\nOne possible approach to begin the process would be to designate a specific time each day, for the next seven days, for deep work. This could be as little as 25 to 50 minutes, and it would be advisable to decide in advance what you will work on during that time. It may also be beneficial to minimize optional decisions and distractions during this period. In that case, it might be best to consider everything else as \"nice to have.\" It has been observed that when an individual's brain begins to anticipate these focus blocks, the inclination to work continuously (and potentially experience burnout) diminishes.\n\nIf you're interested in putting these ideas into practice, you might consider searching for Focuswift on Google. It's designed to help you create a structured and sustainable focus routine, which can help prevent burnout.",

      "text": "I'm 63, overweight, have not been productive my entire life because of anxiety from ADHD. I wasn't diagnosed for who knows why until I was 58.\n\nNow, for three weeks straight, I'm doing well with Pomodoros and even exercising in between them and eating a lot less.\n\nAnd I'll explain why ... I'll try to not be wordy.  \n(I shared this with my therapist this am, who told me he never thought of it like that and is going to adapt it. His Ph.D. invovled shame and guilt.)\n\n1. Getting Clear about Shame\n\nThat deep down feeling that constantly manifests to \"I'm not good enough.\" is shame.\n\nShame is the disappointment of not being god ... of not being able to control or foresee what thoughts involuntarily show up.\n\nYou chose to go to Subway for lunch. But why? Where did that come from? It's your involuntary mind doing it's automatic dance. You have free will ... to react to thoughts, not to control them.\n\nShame is the disappointment ... and the false, paralyzing reaction is that you are flawed, that you can't ... is **procrastination, the fallout of shame.**\n\nAnd until you understand this, emotionally, first person, and you have an omg! moment, you're not getting out of that circle.\n\nAnd this is why every 'here's how you change' guru says that willpower doesn't work ... because it literally can't, but you want to pretend it can, else you're a quitter.\n\nInstead you need to reinforce habits, start with the morning routine and add one every few weeks.\n\nYour goal has to be to become more Pavlovian ... make choices about putting a structure in place so you don't need to make choices. Pomodoro, GTD (Getting Things Done) is about that.\n\n2. Sleeping Pills\n\nI've never had restful sleep but typically fell asleep quickly. My Dr. suggested sleeping pills ... explaining to me that they are NOT just for falling asleep, they help you KEEP asleep.\n\nFor the first time since was very young I actually sleep eight hours straight. I don't even need to use the bath 2-3x as I did. When I wake it's quick, don't need to get another hour over and over. I actually feel rested.\n\n”trazadone is a prescription antidepressant frequently used \"off-label\" as a potent sleeping pill.”\n\n3) Talking and Standing\n\nYour brain switches gears fast .. the involuntary part that you can't control ... the dwelling.\n\nAnd you can reduce it, increasing focus, by **talking because moving is slower than thinking**.\n\nWhen you mechanize your thinking with talking your thoughts - even the little ones, \"right now I am ... \" , you'll instantly get focused. Simple to try.\n\nStanding is a big deal because when you stand there are more fight or flight responses than when (safely) sitting. Standing is better than sitting. Walking is better than not moving.\n\nI hope this helps. This has easily been the most productive part of my life. If I knew this in school it would've been all A's and not C's.",

I’ll sit down at my desk around 9, tell myself I’m going to focus, and then somehow it’s 7pm and I’m still “working.” The weird part is, I’m exhausted, but when I look back at the day, I can’t clearly point to what I actually finished.  \nLast week I caught myself in a stupid loop. I was jumping between tabs, Slack, email, docs, back to Slack, then checking something on my phone “for a second,” then back to work. It felt busy, but not productive. One day I literally timed myself and realized I hadn’t stood up from my chair for almost 4 hours. I hadn’t eaten. I hadn’t even refilled my water. I just kept telling myself “I’ll stop after this one more thing.”  \nThe ironic part is I’m not even under crazy financial pressure. I do have some money saved up from myprize, so it’s not like I’m grinding to survive. I think it’s more this anxiety that if I stop, everything will fall behind. So I tried something dumb-simple this week: I set a hard stop time. No matter what. When the alarm hits, I close the laptop. Even if something is unfinished.\n\nThe first day felt wrong. Like I was being irresponsible. But somehow I got more done because I wasn’t dragging everything out all day. I think my problem wasn’t that I wasn’t working enough. It was that I never let my brain turn off, so everything took longer.\n\nDoes anyone else struggle more with stopping than starting? How do you actually enforce boundaries with yourself when you work like this?",

          "text": "I WFH and I'm mostly self-directed so I know how easy it is to fall into that pattern.\n\nOne technique I use is time blocking. I plan out the amount of time to do a task/project and just do it for that amount of time. I use my calendar to block out those times. When the calendar reminder comes up for the next task, I know to wrap up what I'm working on. Which leads me to...\n\nI also put personal care items on my calendar: lunch break (30min), stretch break (10min), walk break (29min), etc. I get water and snack as necessary during stretch breaks. The rule for me during stretch breaks is that I have to do it away from my computer. Lunch break is very important; I also mark myself out of office for that time.\n\nOne other thing I got in the habit of doing, which was incredibly helpful, was to put an appointment near the end of my workday (for me, 5pm) that's titled \"wrap-up workday\". I have a checklist of things to do during that appointment like plan out the next day, check critical messages, make notes on what I'm working on and haven't finished, etc. When that appointment reminder comes up, it helps me make that cognitive break. \n\nI used to (don't so much anymore) schedule 3-4 times a day to check emails. As we know, there's usually more emails than there is time in the day. I just plan to get as many read and replied to as possible during that time (usually 20-30 min). Then I stop. \n\nThe important thing with this method is to always have a \"next\" event on your calendar that reminds you to switch tasks. (Excepting the wrap-up workday one!)\n\nDo I give myself the freedom to keep working on a task if I'm in the flow? Sure - but then it's a conscious decision to bump something else to make way for the extra time. Do I sometimes come back to work in the evening? Sure, but I've also ensured I've taken a dinner break.",

          "text": "This is exactly right. Most procrastination is about avoiding a feeling, not avoiding work. The task itself is usually easy or at least manageable. What the brain wants to escape is the brief discomfort before starting like uncertainty, fear of doing it badly, or just that awkward tension in the chest.\n\nThat is why motivation magically appears after you begin. Starting proves to your nervous system that the threat was exaggerated, so the emotion drops fast. Waiting just gives the brain more time to invent reasons to stay comfortable.\n\nWhat helps is treating the discomfort as part of the task, not something to eliminate first. You are not trying to feel ready. You are agreeing to feel slightly uncomfortable for 30 to 60 seconds while you begin. Once you expect that feeling instead of fighting it, it loses a lot of power.\n\nA simple trick is to define the start as something laughably small. Not send the email, just open it. Not write the report, just type the title. That lowers the emotional spike enough to get moving, and momentum does the rest.\n\nSo yeah, procrastination is mostly emotion management. Time management only works once the emotions stop running the show.",

      "text": "A few weeks back I felt really stuck in my ways. I was working, did volunteer work and hours of yoga and meditation but I wasn’t getting the results I wanted. Then I talked to a Swami (a monk) from Isha Yoga Center and he gave me some advice. He said to do everything without expectation. He said to do everything simply for the sake of doing it without worrying about the result. Because when you do something and expect a certain result, you are inviting the past into the present. You remember a certain result and you are expecting the same thing to happen again.\n\nSo I tried doing everything without expectations. Simply be present with whatever I was doing and doing it well. To my amazement I started feeling so blissful. Especially after doing my yoga and meditation. But even at work, time was going by much faster and I was really productive. All it takes is a simple shift in attitude from unwillingness to willingness. It’s almost contradictory that letting go of the result, and simply involving oneself with the process, gets the result. When you have one eye on the goal you only have one eye to find the way.",

When your dopamine is down, you feel unmotivated. So when you always have high expectations, then the chances to meet your reward predictions are a lot lower, and chances are high that you are constantly sending your dopamine to the basement. Btw one of the reasons why you should not scroll in the morning:  \nYou wake up, have been 8h offline and have high expectations for what you missed in the meantime. But if Trump hasn't invaded Venezuela, then the answer is: you missed nothing. So chances are high that you are starting with a dopamine deficit most of your days if you scroll first thing in the morning.

You will see, over and over again, how long tasks actually take. (it can be broader like, 4 hours: desk work, it doesn't have to be hyper specific all the time, some time you just gotta sit at work), but if washing the kitchen floor is a task, put those 30 minutes on the calendar. Block your commute, your breakfast.  You will see you only have time for like 3 non-work tasks a day.  That is ok. That is realistic. It's being human. If you over-schedule, that is fine, move your task further down the calendar.  But the concept is once it is 1. Captured and 2. Scheduled, a LOT of the mental load is gone, and  you can focus on following your schedule and doing one task at at time.  \n\nHonestly, i need to get back to this, it really helped me for a few years.

Once momentum kicks in, the anxiety drops and execution gets easier. Actually,  to do lists aren’t that bad, but they work better as storage, not as today’s marching orders.",

The approach is  executed with the next 3 parts:\n   * 1 - We use concrete steps rather than whole ideas\n   * 2 - We create a list of steps we can realistically execute each day, NOT a massive list of *ideas*; ideas are made of steps & a massive list is not a plan we can commit to realistically accomplishing in the working portion of the day\n   * 3 - We are willing to ask for help (in-person, on the phone, and via video calls) instead of *insisting* on working solo\n\nProductivity is an **energy-based game**.  If we choose to fly solo 24/7 & expose ourselves to huge lists of ideas rather than finite lists of steps, then we risk **blowing a mental circuit** & engaging in avoidance behavior by way of task paralysis.  It's hard to see the reality of this system mentally & emotionally because it's an *invisible process*.\n\nOn top of that, our brain HATES being held accountable!  It does NOT want to ask for help, write steps down, or create a finite list to commit to working on & then put that list in the sequence we want to accomplish the steps in.  Instead, it wants to emotionally bully us into keeping the entire list of ideas in our head & insist on working all by ourselves, knowing that we will blow a mental fuse & then not have to expend the energy & effort of doing any actual work.\n\nThat turns into Groundhog Day, where we we keep looping the same behavior over & over again because the process is **invisible**.  Thus we become subject to an *emotion*\\-based approach, i.e. *try really hard* to accomplish whatever we have the *energy* for.  And so our brain will refuse to ask for help, refuse to make a finite written list of steps in sequence, and refuse to work just because it doesn't \"feel\" like it.\n\nThen we're stuck floundering & shorting out quickly!

I just get in and get the work handled and make sure I'm doing everything my power to make it successful but what I am working on in a greater sense of things I'm very passionate about because it was one of my biggest problems growing up and even now today, but now that I'm able to solve that problem that I struggled with forever, and I know that I can help a bunch of other people that's where the passion lies but yet again the actions itself of making this happen. I'm not passionate about workers work and I think at some point you just have a come to Jesus with that and realize the work just needs to get done.",

I realized I’m very logical and analytical and good at numbers/math— I’m also always asking “why”. I pursued data science with a reputable bootcamp (not always suggested but it worked for me). That trickled into data engineering type work, and leading data strategy. I definitely don’t spend my free time writing Python code for fun, but I am sooo much happier and get a lot of fulfillment and am a full on data geek now.

Yes, at times time off work is intolerable and I end up being restless/distracted/useless, but I don’t find it worse than working your as off some place you don’t wholly value in service to something. Unless you’re both, know what you like and are fortunate to be at place of belonging. But truly, how many people are like that…. At least it’s never worked for me that way.  \nFinancial stability, time off after work, and lack of interest are a lot better than having neither. Or having passions and no money.

      "text": "TL;DR: I used to think spirituality was for monks, but it actually saved my life. By practicing yoga and meditation for just 1-1.5 hours a day, I overcame addiction and procrastination, regained my mental clarity, and massively increased my productivity. Here is how it changed everything.\n\nI used to believe that spirituality was reserved for saints living in total seclusion, far away from worldly responsibilities and the comforts of life. I thought it meant escaping reality, but I was so wrong.\n\nWhen life drove me into a corner, I found myself unable to study, lacking mental clarity, and falling into various addictions. I was fed up. I had immense responsibilities, but my compulsive thoughts made it impossible to focus. Time was just slipping away.\n\nEverything changed when I decided to turn toward a practical spiritual path. I realized that spirituality isn't about escaping. It is about living responsibly and building emotional resilience.\n\nWhen I started practicing yoga and meditation, I found a \"gap.\" This was a pause from the compulsive tendencies that fueled my addictions. In just six months, I was able to overcome depressing thought patterns and my tendency to procrastinate vanished.\n\nI gained significant self-discipline and physical energy. My sleep quota reduced because I felt naturally energetic throughout the day. I even began to understand the concept of karma, which helped me recognize the repetitive patterns I was trapped in.\n\nSpirituality is for everyone who wants to escape the cycle of suffering. It is about reaching a point of conscious living where you control your situation rather than letting the situation control you. It allows you to pass through any struggle unaffected, turning ugly situations into greater possibilities.\n\nI truly believe everyone should make yoga and meditation a part of their daily life. It is not just for physical fitness. It is for a lasting impact on your soul. By dedicating just 1 to 1.5 hours daily to these practices, you can experience enormous benefits. No matter what work we do, the time we dedicate to improving ourselves in this way will only increase our productivity in the long run.\n\n“The only way to experience true wellbeing is to turn inward. This is what yoga means. Not up, not out, but in.\n\nThe only way out is in.”\n\n\\-Sadhguru\n\nthank you for reading.",

For example one of the main principles is when you do things, you really care what God thinks about that action but not to get acceptance from other people. You will never satisfy  people's acceptance. So you will not care. You will really know what matters which is the hereafter so your status here on earth doesn't really bother you that much, of course you work , you learn , if money comes that is good if not that is not the main thing , you only live here may be for the next countable years , so it is okay you know, after that(death) if you obeyed God during your life time, you will get that best life in hereafter. \n\nSo you can think of this world like layover. let say you are travelling from London to Japan, and 5 hrs of layover in Dubai. If the Dubai airport was fancy  comfortable and amazing that is good , but even if it is just good that is okay you can have the patience because it is just 5hrs, even if the situation is bad. So religion shows  your purpose, what you should really care for, and how you should live here.",

I do have a lot of good work friends and I’m friendly to people, and of course I’m a people pleaser. This turns into people coming by my desk to “say hi” or vent about their problems or ask a “quick question.” A few would be okay, but sometimes it’s like five different people and before I know it, I’ve lost like two hours of work just with people stopping by. I’ve tried the “stand up” technique and going to the restroom to get away. \nAt my last job I became known as the person who hated small talk, and when I left the job my boss gave me feedback that that reputation was not good. So how do I stay friendly while still getting my coworkers to respect my time?",

I had a co-worker who worked hard to bring people into his office to chit chat so that he could find out what was going on in the company.

This worked well but he felt guilty so he changed a healthier kinds of snacks. A whole bookshelf full of jars of nuts and granola and little plastic cups and scoops.\n\nThere was a systems engineer at the same company who had a sign on his desk that said if my door is open please don't interrupt me unless it's very important. If my door is closed just consider me not here. He enforced these rules diligently for a few weeks. People left him alone after that.",

Let’s talk later” and puts his AirPod in to signal his “call”. He also wears his over the head headphones even if they aren’t on, as a gentle “do not disturb” sign. \n\nI understand the common answer would be to be direct and say “hey I’m busy and have a lot to do” but people can be sensitive and take it as “they don’t want to talk to me” so, I get how this is frustrating! \n\nAt my job, i have gone the route of continuing to work on my computer and give short (but still nice and attentive) answers so that they get the idea that I’m busy. Too many times I have given my full attention and advice to people for over 30 minutes and then that falls on me for picking my kids up late from daycare due to having to catch up, and it’s just not worth it. With this said, when I do get the chance to say hi or see them on break or whatever, I try to catch up with them (quickly) and make it known I still care. I enjoy my coworkers and DO care about them. I did need to set boundaries though for myself, it was hard but I got there. \n\n“Not being one for small talk” IS okay. It’s okay to not be the most extroverted and advice giver in the office. I say, as long as you are friendly and respectful, putting these boundaries up are only going to benefit you AND your company in the long run. You are more productive, focused and comfortable.",

For example, if I had to stop by the DMV or something I would say around 2 PM. I gotta stop by the DMV. It’ll be quick in and out in two seconds. I’ll grab my new ID and I’ll be back to it being productive.\n\nHaving your brain visualize positive things and saying them out loud changes your mental stay completely definitely underrated people may call you weird but do it in the privacy of your home.",

By setting some rules, I can eliminate that process altogether. The less decisions I have to make, it seems, the less friction I experience.\n\nIt’s not about being rigid or extreme, but about saving one’s own mental energy for what is truly important. \"I’m curious how others here think about this:\" Do you find that a strict system helps you be productive, or do you prefer a flexible approach where you can make changes as you go?",

What changed things wasn’t a new technique, but how I approached my own effort. I started paying more attention to *why* I was working, not just *how*. When the goal became improving myself instead of just completing tasks, consistency followed more naturally. Learning a skill, improving focus, and showing up a little better each week felt more sustainable than pushing for perfect days. I also realized how much environment matters. Not just physical space, but mental space. The people you talk to, the content you consume, the ideas you surround yourself with all of it shapes how motivated you feel without you noticing. Being around thoughtful conversations and shared growth made effort feel less lonely. Instead of forcing daily routines, I switched to simple check with myself. What gave me energy? What drained it? What’s one small thing worth doing tomorrow? That clarity reduced procrastination more than any productivity hack I tried.Motivation didn’t come from pressure anymore. It came from direction. Productivity feels different when it’s tied to growth, connection, and purpose not just output.

Nevertheless, behavior is not just built by motivation, the formula is B (behavior) = MAP, (Motivation + Ability + Prompt), and unfortunately motivation is the least reliable.  \nPrompt means a trigger that makes you start, and ability means keeping friction low (physically, mentally, financially, and timely). That's why I always recommend routines.  \n  \nLet's take scrolling first thing in the morning as an example. Routines are great because you don't need willpower, you just execute them without negotiating with your brain.  \n  \nI'm getting up, apps locked with Lemio, and then I directly go to my living room and starting a 30 minute stretching routine.

This is a huge trait in people who suffer from it.\n\n\nYour brain needs that perceived pressure to take action because the prefrontal cortex doesn't spool up like it does in the average person. \n\n\nSome tricks that help me support my laggy brain (and will help you even if you do not have ADHD)\n\n\n• Good sleep hygiene \n\n\n• Exercise\n\n\n• Increase protein in your diet or at least less carbs to avoid the sugary scatter brain fog.\n\n\nThese may sound unrelated, but what those changes do is help support an already struggling brain. Which allows you to just do what you gotta do vs needing the pressure of \"the last minute\"\n\n\nNow for more practical tips:\n\n\nHave routines.\n\n\nOnce you establish them, they become habit which removes a ton of mental load that creates friction for when you need to leave.\n\n\nNo more stressing your morning tasks because they're consistent and you know what time they need to happen by. \n\n\nI broke mine down to be fairly granular and have every major task blocked out for my mornings.\n\n\nHere's my basic list of tasks:\n\n\n• 430am - wake up I immediately hydrate and take my medicine\n\n\n• I get dressed and prepped for my run\n\n\n• I head out and run for about 20 mins\n\n\n• then take a shower\n\n\n• get dressed for work\n\n\n• feed and water my pets \n\n\n• cook breakfast and empty my dishwasher \n\n\n• eat my breakfast\n\n\n• brush my teeth \n\n\n• pack my bag\n\n\n• flex time - this helps me make sure I've gotten or have thought of everything I need for the day and really helps me with the space of time where I'm like, \"am I ready to go? I feel like I'm forgetting something, I can't just go now can I?\" This time is terrible for me as it's basically self-sabotage cus I won't leave even though I am early. But having a block of free time helps a lot.\n\n\n• head out the door for work by 7:20am\n\n\nNow with the help of AI (I use Gemini) I told it to remember that I do all those things every morning and that I wake up at 4:30 am and needed to leave my house by 7:20am. \n\n\nIt then assigned time blocks for each of those tasks and since I specifically asked it to remember this as my m-f morning routine it can reprioritize my morning schedule based off what time I wake up or if I wake up earlier or later. Super helpful and flexible.\n\n\nOf course you can always do it manually, but man leveraging technology is super convenient.\n\n\nThese changes have transformed me from a chronically 10-15 mins late to work every day guy for decades, to early and consistent arrivals. I still struggle with appointments that fall on times not accounted for within my routines, but I no longer believe myself to be a chronically late person (the mindset shift that resulted from the above guide is very helpful for this as well). I could go on for ages, but there's a lot of work to do for optimizing yourself.",

Let me tell you what lateness says to other people: it says my time is more valuable than your time. I don’t value you or your time enough to not keep you waiting.  If you’ve ever taken a class, they started on time.  You were there.   \n\nMake a pack with yourself to be 15 minutes early to absolutely everything. This is for two reasons one if you’re 15 minutes early, you won’t be late and you’ll learn to feel what it feels like to wait for somebody.  You’re 100% right that when you get a big girl job you’ll lose it in a heartbeat if you’re late.  I have a girlfriend who would say that she’s always late, but she’s an anesthesiologist and she manages to get herself to work. In time to start on time. Do you think a surgeon is gonna wait for an anesthesiologist who’s late?  I really think cultivating empathy for the other people in your life who wait for you chronically is enough for you to change your behavior.  \n\nDo you have a narrative probably even Identity that you are just someone who’s late. But you can change that narrative by just deciding that you’re someone who’s on time and you’re on time because you respect other people in their time and you want them to respect you and yours.  Say that to yourself over and over again and pretty soon you’ll start to believe it and after that you’ll start to live it.",

I recently went down a rabbit hole looking into multitasking \"switching costs,\" and the data seems pretty brutal. Based on this \"micro-switches\" between tabs or apps can cannibalize up to 40% of your productive time. (based on recent american psychologists study)\n\nBasically your brain toggles between processes. This \"switching\" triggers two distinct stages in your executive control: goal shifting (deciding to change tasks) and rule activation (re-configuring the brain's \"rules\" for the new task). Every time you check a notification, your brain has to \"uninstall\" the rules for your essay and \"install\" the rules for social media. This mental friction creates a massive \"lag\" that drains your working memory, leaving you mentally exhausted before you’ve even finished your first paragraph.\n\nIn short: You’re effectively wasting 40% of you brain capacity to set up your brain for a different task.",

I know a lot of people have problems with the pomodoro technique, but the base idea behind it of locking into one task at a time has been a huge help for my productivity. I don't follow the original technique exactly to the tee, but that specific part of it I always try to follow.",

The way it helps is when you have a timer actively running and you go to procrastinate, you know you're kind of messing up that time that you're tracking (it's no longer accurate toward a single task if you spend even just a few mins of it slacking off). \n\nYou can also motivate yourself by thinking, \"Ok, I want to procrastinate right now, but let me just finish this timer first and then I can slack off for a bit\"",
