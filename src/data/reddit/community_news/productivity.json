      "text": "I tried doing proper “deep work” today. Phone on silent. No notifications. No music. No background noise. Just me and a single task I needed to focus on.\n\nI lasted 12 minutes\n\nIt wasn’t boredom that broke me it was anxiety. The second everything went quiet my brain filled the space with intrusive thoughts, worry spirals and that familiar tight feeling in my chest. The distractions weren’t killing my productivity. They were buffering my mind.\n\nIt hit me that a lot of productivity advice assumes your brain is a safe, neutral place to be alone in. Like if you just remove external noise you’ll naturally focus. But for me, silence isn’t calm it’s loud. Constant input isn’t always avoidance; sometimes it’s regulation.\n\nNow I’m questioning how much of my “bad focus” is actually me unconsciously managing anxiety the only way I know how. And how much advice about focus completely ignores mental health realities.\n\nI still want to work better. I just don’t think stripping everything away is the solution when the problem isn’t distraction it’s what shows up when the distraction disappears.\n\nGave up after those 12 minutes and spent the next hour alternating between work and jackpot city just to keep my brain occupied enough to not spiral. Got way more done that way than trying to force the \"pure focus\" thing.",

Not always true, but mostly true. It's almost like music provides my brain the *'train tracks of motion through time'* that give focus something to ride on that moves forward.\n\nThe parameters matter depending on the situation: volume, words or wordless, analog earthy rhythmn, or driving fixed beat. Occasionally, touches of dead silence help. But 16 hours straight? no thanks.\n\nI would say I am focus-challenged, but my emotional regulation is super flat and consistent, thus -- 0% adhd.",

          "text": "This thread is hitting something most productivity advice completely ignores: **capacity fluctuates**. I;m an old adhd/dyslexic hack. Worked in IT for many decades. \n\nThe \"deep work\" framework assumes you're starting from a regulated state with full executive function available. But that's not where most of us live. We're already depleted when we sit down. Already managing background anxiety, sleep debt, life stress, neurodivergent patterns - whatever. And advice designed for someone at full capacity doesn't just fail when you're depleted. It backfires. Because now you've failed at the thing that was supposed to help, which makes everything worse.\n\nWhat helped me was stopping the fight against distraction and starting to ask a different question: **What's my actual capacity right now, and what strategy works for** ***that*** **state?**\n\nFull capacity? Yeah, maybe deep work is possible. Moderate capacity? Structured sprints with intentional breaks (several people here mentioned this). Low capacity? You might need external scaffolding - music, body doubles, background noise - just to stay functional. Near zero? Honestly, survival mode. Do what gets you through.\n\nThe person who said they got more done alternating work with something else wasn't failing at focus. They were matching their strategy to their actual state instead of the state they wished they had.\n\nThat's not a hack. That's intelligence about your own capacity. Most of us were never taught to think that way.",

          "text": "Honestly this is crazy to me, because I always work like this. Background noise and distractions immediately kill my focus.\n\nSome tips: \n- Wear headphones, if you absolutely cannot be in silence, try white noise.\n- Clean your workstation completely, leave NOTHING out of place. Things in your peripheral vision attract your attention, especially phone. My setup is facing a wall, only glass of water, keyboard and mouse on the table.\n- Always put your phone on silent and out of your line of sight. There's studies that indicate that we give a part of our attention to our phone always when we can see it. I hide mine in a drawer or behind myself.\n- Natural light, hard one especially now when there's like two hours of it available. But open your blinds, stare outside a bit every day to signal your brain awakeness. Also white and bright light bulbs work for me.\n- AIR. Take breaks and breathe clean air, open a window. I do this every day, no matter the freezing temps. Oxygen depletion makes you irritable, sleepy and have bad concentration.\n\nProbably nothing groundbreaking here, but just my two cents.\n\nEDIT: I have ADHD too btw, so im not a neurotypical giving advice lol",

I find Lofi perfect for me but for others that might be something else.\n\n3. Easing yourself in to a task by dialling down expectations... eg I'm just going to read some background info, write some dot points. I find I need to calm my brain if I'm starting a new task and what others might consider busy work is actually orientation and necessary.\n\n4. Pomodoros which others have mentioned can help here too but can set the timer for 10-15 mins or even 5 mins. I really like the Llama life app 🦙 it has the option of a pie timer that I like better than a digital number to count down and lots of colour and emojis that make it fun to use. Made by someone with ADHD who gets it.\n\n5. Virtual coworking - there are a number of services that do paired or group coworking. I prefer group personally.\n\nDon't feel that you have to do deep week, if you find yourself in flow that's great but working frequently on a task in small increments can also work well.",

Which sounds a lot like what you're doing with distractions, I do worry though that your form of getting out of your own head may not be a long term sustainable solution. For me after I initially got out of my own head and just commited to going to training regularly and focusing on something outside of myself (just showing up and hopefully getting better), things started to get better with time, I started deepening my relationships with others and talking about it with ones I truly trusted and felt close enough to (for me it was family at first and then some friends later). I also then started to add in other things like mindfullness but I 100% recognise the stage you're in right now that mindfullness often makes things worse. I hope that my experiences can help you in some way, also I found that never framing it as me having anxiety was a big thing, I was always just dealing with it as i knew it wasn't my identity.",

You get it.\n\nThe thing is I realized my problem wasnt that I wasnt being productive, its that I have terrible memory for what I actually accomplished. My brain would just fixate on the 50 things I didnt do yet and completely ignore what I did finish. Now when im feeling like I got nothing done I can literally see this jar filling up over time and it actually helps me chill out.\n\nAlso theres something satisfying about the physical act of dropping the paper in there that hitting a checkbox on my phone never gave me. I had some money aside that I wanted to invest into productivity stuff and was looking at like fancy planners and app subscriptions but this $8 jar ended up working way better than anything else I tried.\n\nWhen the jar gets full (happened once so far after like 2 months) I dump it out and read through everything which feels pretty good ngl\n\nAnyways just wanted to share cause most productivity stuff focuses on planning what to do but this helped me acknowledge what I already did which turned out to be what I actually needed",

I’m a mess.\n\nMy girlfriend will tell me something important (like a specific food she hates or a date she’s stressed about), and I just nod and rely on my brain to remember it.\n\nSpoiler: I don't. Two weeks later, I buy the wrong food or forget to ask about her meeting, and she feels like I don't listen.\n\nIt feels stupid that I have all these high-end productivity systems for my job, but I’m \"winging it\" with the person I actually care about.\n\nI’m thinking of building a simple \"lazy\" bot for myself in a weekend to fix this. \n\nBasically, I want to just text it things like \"She wants to try that new sushi place\" or \"Ring size is 6\" and have it remind me later. \n\nNo complex forms, just a quick brain dump so I don't drop the ball.\n\n*** My question for you guys:\nHas anyone else successfully applied \"work productivity\" methods to their dating life?

That was *before* we were both diagnosed with Autism and ADHD. \n\nFor me the digital calendar has been a lifesaver for a long time because I have multiple chronic health conditions which has required me to get to MANY doctors' appointments on the right day at the right time since I was on my own as a legal adult. The only way I wouldn't forget was if something popped up a notification (preferably multiple places, once that was possible with smartphones) and reminded me. \n\nIn my world, if an event isn't on the calendar it doesn't exist. I do also struggle with the things OP has mentioned like forgetting certain details or facts about people, which I've tried to accommodate in multiple ways over the years. I've tried spreadsheets, notebooks, note apps, on and on. What I most recently have been using (and I'm not getting paid for this or anything, I've just found this app to be incredibly helpful and works with my thinking style) is an app called capacities.io. I like it because you can create different object types and then associate the objects with each other which then automatically form a sort of \"mind map\" or web with links to each other that you can click through if you're having trouble remembering \"that one thing\" 🤣. It's been really helpful for me and my forgetful brain !",

          "text": "As someone who is Clinically double diagnosed with combined ADHD and I believe possible undiagnosed autism (my 17 year old son has diagnosed autism) I see similar traits in me as he has, especially since taking medication for adhd and suddenly the adhd doesn’t mask what I feel is my autistic and extreme sensory side as much plus being 43, Female, Peri Menopause is defo playing apart.  \n\nI feel using productivity and organisational apps in both personal life and for my online businesses to be such a massive help and support.  \n\nNotion is defo one of my favourite tools. Monday is great for creating more daily and weekly to do lists. Notion is great for breaking down bigger goals or just storing information, notes, resources, reminders etc for anything and everything and as you already use notion, you will likely already know a fair bit about it.  \n\nI usually create like one main dashboard page for each area of interest. Then the main dashboard page usually acts like an index. I then create individual sub topic pages. Then on the main dashboard page, I add the titles of the subpages and then do the @symbol and click on relevant page so it builds up like a book. \n\nI have a general life dashboard. I also have boards/ pages for: my ADHD (medication tracking, diagnosis letters etc),  Driving lessons (individual lesson reports, learning resources, theory test result, practical test dates etc), just recent set one up so I can start monitoring things with my son for his future like what is he going to do after this course he’s doing now, other course options, apprenticeship options, access to work details, any autism funded opportunities for him, will eventually upload a cv and a few covering letters for him. \n\nChatGPT is a godsend if you really know how to use it, to its potential, you can build like a profile or custom gpt or just general chat history about your girlfriend so you can ask ChatGPT general questions later on, like if you build up history on her likes and dislikes, you can then later on ask ChatGPT for help and advise in picking a birthday present out for her. \n\nYou can also build up a relationship history with ChatGPT too. \n\nAlthough to do lists are helpful, sometimes they can leave people feeling overwhelmed, disappointed and deflated, especially when they not fully completed or just more gets added and the list grows on top of an already uncompleted to do list. As a motivational booster. You can have screw it lists (add things that aren’t urgent, things you can eliminate altogether coz your never going to do them, and things you can delegate to others as things that are not your strengths) and also Done It List, (I call them F**king Done it lists) where I can get a blank piece of paper and just write every thing done that I fully completed task wise, attended appointments, lessons done, learning something new, helping someone out etc, little things and bigger things, small tasks or bigger projects. Then at the end of a day or week or two weeks, you can see everything you have DONE rather than just staring at a list seeing everything you HAVEN’T DONE and Psychologically it does make you feel much better about yourself and boosts your self esteem, shows you, that your doing more than you give yourself credit for. \n\nBest of Luck. \n\nMerry Christmas if you Celebrate 🥳 and all the Best for 2026.",

          "text": "Partner forgets things a lot, so he takes the time to write it down (in a planner, software, note, who cares). This makes you a thoughtful partner, not outsourcing your relationship. Some of these comments don’t pass the vibe check. \n\nThe line for me is when the software takes action for you instead of letting you do the action. For example, having an AI assistant or software write a kind note to your partner at some cadence bc she gave you feedback you don’t say nice stuff enough or something. The software is doing the work and that’s lame and she doesn’t know she’s reacting to a bot. But a software reminding you to do that is, imho, totally fine and more effort than many partners bother with — instead they often just opt to miss things. \n\nMy husband and I share a calendar bc we will both forget things otherwise. I have our birthday and anniversary in there, and everything else thats important. and I often set reminders a couple weeks before for things that I know I need to prep for. \n\nI have a shortcut in my phone that makes it easier for me to ask my husband “when are you planning to leave the office today” if he doesn’t proactively tell me when he’s leaving. It’s a manual trigger, but it automatically prompts me, “do you want to run this shortcut?” I used to be mad he wouldn’t communicate with me, but in an effort to meet him halfway I automated that message. Someone might say, “you shouldn’t have to do that, it’s his responsibility to communicate” sure it is and I told him that, but it comes down to is it more important that HE tells me or that I have the info I need? I automated it so that it’s not hard either way. \n\nTLDR; Use software to help you remember things, it’s more effort than most partners bother with. In most cases you will need to take the action yourself to ensure your partner isn’t talking to a bot without their knowledge. \n\nIf your partner is dying on the hill of, “but I want this to be important enough for you to just remember it,” I would just calmly explain that my memory is not a good gauge of how important things are to me, I forget things that are important in MY life all the time, so adding hers in does not make it any less important. \n\nAnd if you are really worried, I’d package the messaging like this, “hey, I know you’ve brought up a few times that I am missing important stuff. I don’t want to keep doing that so I’m putting everything into a calendar/software/etc, so that I can set reminders for myself to not forget. I’m hoping that keeps me on top of things so that I don’t miss things that are important and that I want to do for you but slip my mind when things are busy.” I can’t imagine a girl that wouldn’t see that as admirable effort to meet her needs.",

You can use the calendar feature to journal with the date associated. You just write whatever you feel is important and connect that topic or page by using double brackets. So if she tells me today she likes sushi I'll write: [[Person's name]] liked sushi from [[Place name]]. I'll write this simple line under the date. When I click on person's name I'll see a reference from this date saying I mentioned this fact. I'll have a connection built by date now. If it's something really important like the ring size maybe I'll add that info inside her page as a note. When I click on person's name or go on her page I can see important notes that may be useful later. I can also link other notes such as places visited, her family info, her gift ideas, etc. Plus the search feature is really fast if needed.",

You CAN remember if you take the right steps. Why can't you take the right steps with your PARTNER? Don't feel like your PARTNER is 'paying' you enough to pay attention? Your BOSS would just fire your butt - maybe your partner should consider doing the same?\n\nIt's a copout saying you don't like the vibe of having to use tools for a relationship - your gf doesn't care how you remember as long as you do whatever it takes to make her a priority.",

But put me somewhere public or on a call where someone can see me working and suddenly my brain turns on. Tasks feel doable. Time moves.\n\nThat’s when it hit me my productivity isn’t internally driven. It’s performative. I’m motivated by being seen as productive not by the work itself. Without external accountability, my brain just stops initiating.\n\nWhat frustrates me is that most productivity advice assumes motivation comes from inside. Discipline, goals, passion, willpower. But for me none of that works without some form of social presence even passive.\n\nHow do people actually motivate themselves from an internal source? Is this something you can build or do some brains just need external structure to function?\n\nI’m trying to figure out whether this is a flaw I need to fix or just a reality I need to design my life around.\n\nHad a work from home day yesterday with zero meetings.

In fact, when I get the chance, I explicitly choose the desk that's the least popular among my office, just because that's also the one that was closest to foot traffic. More foot traffic = more people = more accountability in my head.\n\nIn contrast, my WFH days feel less structured, almost aimless, and definitely less productive in ways. \n\nTo address this I've done:\n\n1.

      "text": "Hey guys, I’ve found something that has helped me stay a lot more focused throughout the day.\n\nIt’s not 100% (nothing is) and I still have my weak moments, but I find I can focus SIGNIFICANTLY better than before I started. \n\n**I’m far more productive and less scatterbrained than I used to be.**\n\nAround my late teens/early 20s, I noticed my attention span getting worse and worse.  \n\nIt literally felt like my ability to focus was broken.\n\nAnytime I tried to focus on something that wasn’t interesting, I just…. COULDN’T do it!\n\n**This pissed me off because I didn’t used to be like that!**\n\nIn the past, I could concentrate really well.\n\nIt was easy for me to read books for hours on end, maintaining my focus the entire time. \n\nEven for the stuff I didn’t wanna do (like writing an essay, finishing homework, doing annoying work, etc), I could maintain my focus for those things too!\n\nBut my brain changed, and I knew the reason why:\n\n**Too much time spent on screens.** \n\nSPECIFICALLY on phone scrolling apps. \n\nBut many of us don’t realize just HOW MUCH it affects our brains.\n\nWhen we engage in hours of scrolling throughout the day, we are literally training our brains to “give up” when something is boring.  \n\nThe very instant your brain isn’t stimulated anymore, you move your thumb an inch and \\*BOOM\\* there’s something new to look at. \n\nDo that for hours every day?\n\nAnd now you have changed the wiring in your brain to be lazier and seek cheap novelty instead of deep focus.\n\n**If you’re still with me after all this…**\n\nI found something that is an antidote to this.  \n\nIt’s the complete OPPOSITE of scrolling.  \n\nThis technique has no novelty. You have to sit with your boredom because there's nothing new to look at.\n\nYou focus entirely on a single point. \n\nAnd over time, this improves your ability to focus more deeply.\n\n**So what is it?**  \n\nFire Gazing Meditation. \n\nIt’s been a gamechanger for me. \n\nI can say, without a doubt, it has improved my ability to focus.  \n\nMy productivity has skyrocketed and I can actually get the stuff done I wanna do each day. \n\nAnd I spend just 10 minutes per day doing this meditation. \n\n**So how do you do it?**\n\nIt’s really simple.  \n\n1. Just light a candle and stare at the flame for a few minutes.\n2. Then close your eyes and stare at the afterimage created from the flame.  \n3. And once the afterimage disappears from behind your eyelids, open your eyes again and repeat the whole process again.  \n4. And your mind is going to wander, but any time you notice it wandering, you just bring your attention back to the flame or afterimage.\n\nAnd that’s it.\n\nI hope it will help you guys out, as it has for me. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions about fire gazing meditation!",

You must manually mark off those squares (just fill them) on each timer beep. This should be bringing you back to your original task often enough that you start doing it.

Another way to deal with it is to increase friction between your hand, brain and the app. For instance, by using the web version of it? \nEngaging in long form activities or allowing yourself to be bored can reset to some extent. \n\nAnother great (altho childish) trick is to do something important or productive everytime you wish to go back to this habit. Basically distracting yourself by replacing with another activity - like i will clean one shelf every time i think of opening social media or I will walk 10, 20, 50 steps before i could open the app. \n\nSometimes if it induces anxiety by not scrolling - then it would be worth speaking to an expert. We often don’t realise that such dopamine is maybe masked as coping mechanism.",

I'd say I was a decent reader. my goal is to diversify my reads and get into things I'm genuinely interested in stead of reading for the sake of doing it. if I've picked a tough book (very comprehensive/heavy) in non fiction or classics (which I find tougher to go through), I just pick an easier read the next time which is more factual and not thought provoking/introspective. i also got into philosophy this year, and I read some really good stuff, which made me want to delve deeper, so I ended up reading a lot. reading is a very engaging hobby, you just to need to try different genres to see what lands for you and you'll look forward it!",

Once you cure the FOMO urge and set some boundaries for how much time you will spend outside your immediate, you can set goals for yourself to help you maintain a lifestyle not wasted on endless scrolling.\n\nThe real world is slow. And it can be discomforting with the \"quick-win\" expectation you've set for yourself.  But trust the process.\n\nMake a weekly list, start a hobby, agree to call or text someone you know atleast once a day, pick a time of day to scroll and make it short (like 30 minutes), take the remaining to read a local paper, watch local news.  After a few weeks, you'll start to realize no one from social media is calling you.  But maybe that person you texted last week wants to know what you're doing for lunch.  You won't miss scrolling.",

I scrambled around with different jobs but it was all very unstable. About ten years later I had an idea that I thought would benefit gas stations, took it to Shell, and they liked it (they were, I think, benevolent to a young man trying his best). Things went fairly well. I bought some equipment and stuff on a loan (again I think I got points for being ballsy and with Shell on the contracts they went along). Then there was this big gas crisis thing, the contracts were cancelled. I paid the loans off, late, with money I scrounged up and the banker was pissed (I think he was put in a difficult situation by me). That was it, I was homeless. I wanted to withdraw from the world, found a very cool house which had been uninhabited for some time ( I was living in a house converted to a hay storage shed on the property beside it)- the lady was very sweet to me and wanted me to fix the place up. It was on 20 acres and about as remote as you could get. I took a job as a laborer on a construction site and started a garden and stuff. A few months later, I went and picked up my younger brother to show him the house but when we pulled up that evening, the house was gone, it had burned down while I was gone. The next day the engine blew in my van. I lost everything including an incredible coin collection I had built from the age of 8. All my clothes. Everything.\nIt was hard to bounce back after that. At about the age of 31 or so I decided I had to get into computers. I had never used a computer before so it was a tall undertaking. I interviewed with someone and called him every day for a month to see if they had made a decision. On the 30th day, I called him and upon being told they were still undecided, I told him I would show at 8:00 the next morning big and if he told me to go home, that’s what I would and not bother him any further. He told me to wear a suit and be prepared to work. I was employed to sell computer supplies and I learned all I could. Eventually, I worked elsewhere and saw a product I really like. I was the only salesperson that seemed fired up about and was selling it. The company offered to set me up as a distributor (age 36). I have sold millions of dollars of that and related products. I have done very well, but I haven’t forgotten what it is like to go hungry or live with rats in a shed. I have compassion for people having a tough time.",

I've been trying to quit nicotine for 3 months, I spiraled and lost control of a lot of things. this morning was one of the first mornings in a long time where I was up before I absolutely had to be.\n\n Unlike my old productive self who would follow some routine, I screwed off my time(I can't even remember what I did with my time really). I'm not mad about it at all. I was really just happy to be getting up sooner. This made me realize that maybe I'm not the person who gets out of bed and goes straight into go mode. Maybe just making my bed and then chilling for 30 minutes is better for me. Does anyone else just take time to chill and wake up in the morning before starting their day? It's an interesting thought that maybe doing what I thought was right in the past was really not the best thing for me as an individual. ",

I get to keep the identity of someone with plans and ambitions without the discomfort of attempting them.\n\nIt's safer that way.

I'm still figuring it out. But now when I catch myself saying \"I'm going to\" I stop and ask if I actually am or if I'm just performing intention.\nMost of the time it's performing.\n\nAnd maybe that's okay for some things.

If you're frustrated about something write it all and make sure it's all raw. Write things you can't talk out loud. And delete that after writing. Do it until you're comfortable with writing your thoughts as is. Then you can move to journal prompts. Choose three questions or topics like \"what are you grateful for? \", \" Habits you want to add in your life\" And \"what good you did in this week\". And write about three lines to each question everyday. Then slowly move to habits tracker or more structured journals. This worked for me. And I'm super lazy haha. Hope this helps.",

Just the task to document my life felt overwhelming. And that‘s what I thought diaries were all about. But they can be anything you want them to be! You can even do a daily collage of things that crossed your path. A word that you found funny or an idea you had. It can be anything. Words, pictures, sounds… find something that expresses best how you want to  remember your life when you look back. It should be something that‘s fun doing and feels meaningful to you - not something you start and then avoid doing all day long because you‘d rather do something else.",

Planning, lists, tutorials all feel productive because they avoid that uncomfortable first step. Once I’m in, I’m fine!\n\nA few things that genuinely help me with this start resistance:\n\n\\- Lower the start bar to something almost stupidly small. something like \"open the document”, “write one sentence”, “run the script once”. This makes getting started a little easier.\n\nSeparate starting from continuing. I’ll often tell myself I’m only have to work for 5–10 minutes. Knowing I can stop removes a lot of resistance. Most of the time I keep going anyway, but the permission to stop is key.\n\nUse external triggers instead of relying on willpower. Timers work better than motivation. So does having something prompt you rather than deciding internally every time.\n\nTools that help me specifically:  \n– Forest: good for committing to a short focus block without overthinking  \n– Todoist (or similar), but only if you limit yourself to 1–3 tasks max  \n– SprintBuddy: a Telegram bot I use that sends one tiny 5-minute task per day. It teaches you how to study, be more productive, and set goals.\n\ndon’t aim to be productive, just aim to start! hope this helps!",

          "text": "Look, if you want to overcome that suck factor of starting a task, I would suggest you first of all make your tasks crystal clear from start to bottom to the end. Why is that? Because when your mind knows why you're doing it in the first place, what's the urgency, cost, benefits, plus when you know for how much time you'll do the task, for example it's 30 minutes or 60 minutes, and where will you do it? At your room, bed, or desk? Everything must be clear. Plus, you should know how your \"done\" will actually look like in each task, because without an end point, just starting, you may find it less interesting and less serious. Therefore, I would say clear everything in detail for yourself. Write the \"why\" in detail, why you're doing it in the first place. Plus, dive deeper, not only this much surface, but dive more deeper. And the second thing you should do in order to remove resistance is simply focus on task time rather than day time. Look, I've seen everyone, even me in the past, used to make this mistake of thinking that I got so much time left in the day, I'll do it then or later. But if you keep doing it, the resistance becomes even stronger. That's why just focus on the task time. How much time will this actually take? Like half an hour or just 1 hour, that's it? After doing it, you'll still have the whole time left in the day without any problem. So just do that. Focus on task time, how much time will it take, and just do it. The main thing I would say which can beat this resistance more better is having a strong why, as I said. So follow it. You'll make mistakes, it's fine, but constant practice will make you do this perfectly. Good luck. Peace.",

Are these people that just watch YT documentaries all day or is there a website dedicated to interesting things? And I'm not talking just about quick interesting facts on shorts... I'm looking for  something that actually goes into great detail about why they're interesting. Like mythical creatures, gods, animals, space, etc. Things I can learn about them that I can connect to in reality. Is this pretty much the history channel or what? I'd prefer books too.",

The internet is your oasis for gathering a treasure trove of knowledge and wisdom; it is also a place of reference to find books of interests. As someone else has said, you can begin by writing down a list of subjects and a list of topics that you’re interested in. If you’re interested in books, Google “Which [book] is best for beginners subreddit. Use “subreddit” or “Quora” as key words to find comments recommending such books. \n  \n**Sources** \n- [For encyclopaedia of mythology pertaining to Gods: Mythopedia](https://mythopedia.com/)\n- [Basic encyclopaedia on animals](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals)  \n- [Science ABC YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@scienceabc?si=HR1PRFRLagcQsbH-)  \n   - Hover over to the playlists of the channel and feel free to watch through all of the videos.\n- - -  \nAlong the journey of learning, you will also formulate questions after reading or watching materials:  \nE.g. *Why do black holes have strong gravitational force? What exactly is mass? How does hibernation work for bears? When did Constantinople fall and why? Who are these Gods and who still worships them today?*\n\nWhat makes them interesting is dependent on you. What do you think makes them interesting? Why are they interesting? Is it the way the Earth somehow doesn’t veer away from the solar system? Is it the continuous veneration of Gods despite political and social prosecutions? Or is it about the way that horned-dung beetles are capable of pulling over 1,141 times its own body weight? \n  \nIn fact, ask yourself these questions and then research them further: how does it work and why is it so? \n- - -  \nAs a note, the problem we often find ourselves clashing against is the plethora of options presented in front of us (the Paradox of Choice or Choice Overload). There’s too many topics. We procrastinate because we’re undecided; therefore, it’d be beneficial to decide right on the spot what you want to learn first. Every subject field is a galaxy and every topic is a planet. You could spend years just learning about animals or space alone. Invest your time carefully and with consideration. Focus on one topic at a time.  \n- - -  \nMy advice is to follow your curiosity and question everything: *Who, what, when, why, how*. \n- [My post on Leonardo Da Vinci’s Principles](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jimu_Monk9525/s/xc9rBtW6jR)",

I've taken community college classes for fun and they're relatively affordable if you aren't getting credits. Adult ed is also a great option with a diverse set of classes, if there's something near you. There are great online classes of all kinds. Foreign languages in synchronous group classes can,be great.  Also there's MOOCs, which are often free or low cost.  If youre looking for social events/shared group interests, there may be things locally - an astronomical society, for example. \n\nGood luck!

My attention span is very short—I can usually only focus on a task, read a book, or even meditate for about a minute before my mind wanders.\n\nI’m also a gamer. Currently, I’m playing *Raid: Shadow Legends*. For those who don't know, it has a lot of activities that require you to click every 1-5 seconds to auto-play. The problem is that this mechanic completely fragments my attention. For example, if I watch a 10-minute You-Tube video, I’ll get distracted 10 times just to click \"auto\" in the game. Cruelly, this distraction is reinforced because I get rewarded in-game for doing it.\n\nContinuing to play makes it nearly impossible to train my focus, which is crucial for my performance at work. However, the thought of quitting makes me feel incredibly empty—like life lacks meaning without it. I feel like I’d have to change my core nature and a part of my identity just to adapt to \"adult life.\"\n\nI also feel weak for not being able to balance both: satisfying my hobby (online gaming/collecting) while achieving success in my career.\n\nWhat should I do? Has anyone else dealt with this specific type of \"auto-play\" distraction?",

You can find one for yourself, too.\n\nThose games use addiction creating mechanisms against you. At least in Pokémon Go, you get addicted to moving around, so you trade attention for fitness. In other instances, it is pure evil. Mostly, you trade attention for rising frustration to push you into spending money.\n\nThe first step to fighting addiction is admitting you have a problem. Done.

Rewards are dragged out at just barely a fast enough rate to keep you hooked. There's often an early overload of stuff to make you feel invested and after a little bit of reasonable gameplay they turn the screws. \n\nSuddenly resources dry up, and the 2x production speed for watching an ad seems like a good deal. Oh you need more wood? Watch this ad and you can have a couple more! Oh you need more than that? well look at all of this wood and other resources you could get if only you gave us your payment details.\n\nIt's a really gross industry, and obviously not all mobile games are as predatory as the worst ones.

These are textbook dependency patterns. The game isn't filling a void—it's creating one and then selling you the temporary fix. That empty feeling when you think about quitting? That's withdrawal from a dopamine cycle, not evidence that the game gives your life meaning.\n\nThe fact that you're even asking strangers on Reddit means some part of you already knows.\n\nYou don't need to \"balance\" this. You need to treat it like what it is. There are actual resources for gaming addiction—support groups, therapists who specialize in it, even subreddits like r/StopGaming full of people who've been exactly where you are.\n\nYou're not weak for struggling with this.

Instagram was the hardest because I posted my artwork, kept up with classmates and got updates on my peripheral social circle through it, but I was losing hours on reels which was a feature I just couldn’t disable. I’d had it for years so I archived my work and grabbed a few phone numbers from people. the moment I permanently deleted my account I literally felt like I could breathe again. Like this huge weight that I didn’t know existed was lifted off my chest. \n\nI think you will benefit from a similar radical change.

          "text": "Not to belabor the obvious, but have you been assessed for ADHD or the like?\n\nIf your attention span really is that short, even for tasks that you know need doing, maybe it's more of a medical condition, and not a personal weakness? It may be less of a \"ditch the things that distract you\" type thing, and more of a cognitive therapy/medication issue. It is entirely possible that the reason you've been struggling with what feels like gaming addiction is more of a symptom of an undiagnosed learning/behavior disability than an actual personal failure in your part. I know it can feel like a cop out and a bit taboo to say \"it's not my fault, I'm just wired a little differently, so I need medication/therapy\" but I would not rule it out.\n\nI mean, distractions are real, and they do happen, but if you know they always happen, and that they get in the way of things you feel are important, maybe a checkup would be helpful, if for no other reason than to know for sure? Sometimes things that you feel are normal for you, are really not that normal for everyone else.\n\nTo use myself as an example:  \nI used to fail at college, falling asleep in classes and the like. I did not party, and went to bed early, and woke up at a reasonable time. I used to think maybe classes were really boring, and that I was just losing interest on what I was being taught, and that maybe that was why I wasn't doing well.  \nIt wasn't until much later (10+ years) that I learned I was suffering from sleep apnea and barely sleeping at all at night. I got that treated, have gone back to college and am currently maintaining a 3.8 GPA.\n\nSo, if you are really struggling, I'd suggest at least getting a screening done, in case it isn't just a simple issue of you having a temporary distraction getting on the way. You might discover that your life significantly improves from having figured out what was really going on in your life, in all kinds of ways. It may be that you don't need to stop enjoying gaming, or have your career take a hit because of it, but instead you just need the proper treatment to be able to do both successfully.",

That empty feeling when you think about quitting isn’t your identity disappearing… it’s withdrawal, and it does pass.\n\nThis probably isn’t about “balance” yet. You can’t rebuild focus while something is actively training distraction, especially auto-play games. That doesn’t mean quitting gaming forever, but it may mean stepping away from this type of game for a while.\n\nIf this kind of distractibility has always been there -school, reading, work - it might be worth looking into ADHD, not as a label, just as an explanation that changes what tools actually work.\n\nThe real question isn’t why you can’t handle both. It’s what you’re training your brain to do every day.",

Art hobbies on the other hand drain my focus in minutes because I don’t have as developed networks for that domain.\n\nI don’t think your gaming habit has much if at all to do with focus problems in other domains. Unless of course gaming addiction is pulling you away from other tasks. \n\nYour work is mentally very challenging, so naturally that’s going to quickly deplete your ability to focus, no matter how motivated and interested you are.

And so my motivation just dwindled, I could barely get myself out of the house some days without a scheduled, paid for lesson, my work was suffering cause I has been there for awhile and I just could not be bothered anymore. Unless a deadline was looming I was not gonna start things proactively because I knew I could get things done quickly and easily last moment.  🙃 Eventually a therapist introduced the concept of a \"bore out\" to me, instead of a burnout. Good for you to look it up.\n\nSo maybe take a good look at things and people around you and see what you are doing just because of convenience, proximity or hype, and what do you genuinely enjoy doing. Are you happy with your social circle, do you feel like you can actually open up to these people, or is it just superficial activities keeping you together? A friend of mine recently started going back to her childhood hobbies, basically also trying to rediscover the things that genuinely made her happy and excited. \n\nI don t know if you can relate, just some hints and tips for you, but good luck going forward.",

I was in a similar situation where I was trying to focus on something important to me, but had no motivation to do it, and life seemed so mundane. I got distracted so easily, and this made me so furious because I wanted better from myself, so I took action. I not only want to give you advice, but also help you on your journey. Doing a dopamine detox is the cure for you, not a band-aid solution, because it will rewire your brain to be able to focus again, have the ability to do hard things, and ultimately enjoy more out of life. However, doing a dopamine detox can be incredibly hard with no experience. So as I said, I would love to help you with that because. Just message me if you want any help",

I’ve experienced moments where everything feels overwhelming and even the things I used to enjoy just... fall flat. It’s damn frustrating when you’re doing all the ‘right’ things, eating well, staying active, and still feel stuck.\n\nYou know, I think, those feelings can be deeper than just motivation. When you mentioned feeling like there’s an invisible wall, I felt that. It kinda feels like you’re in a fog that you can't cut through.\n\nDuring those times, I feel it helps a lot when I take a step back and focus on the small wins. Instead of trying to dive into something big, I’d set simpler, more achievable goals, like reading a page of a book, taking a short walk, or even just sitting quietly for a few minutes. It’s less about productivity and more about reconnecting with yourself in a gentle way.\n\nIt’s okay to feel lost and to sit with those feelings instead of forcing yourself to push through. You’re definitely not alone bro. It’s alright to take it one day at a time.",

If I keep the streak going, great, but if I miss a day, it suddenly feels worse than if I’d never tracked it at all.\n\nA silly example, but imagine a toothbrush counter at 5,000+ uses. Missing one day doesn’t just reset a number, it makes every future brush remind you of the break. At least that’s how it feels for me.\n\nI’ve found that simpler systems, like just checking something off and moving on, actually work better for my brain. Less pressure, less “I ruined it” feeling.\n\nCurious how others experience this. Does gamification genuinely help you stick with things, or does it sometimes backfire?",

Everyone's treating focus drift like a bug to fix. It's not. It's data.\n\nThat moment where your brain wanders after 10 minutes - that's not failure. That's your brain telling you something about your actual capacity right now. Not your capacity on a good day. Right now.\n\nI work with this stuff a lot (capacity coaching, basically, neuroscience) and the pattern I see constantly is people trying to force 30-minute focus blocks when they're already running on fumes. Of course it doesn't hold. You're asking a stretched system to perform like a rested one.\n\nTry this instead: before you start, just... notice how stretched you actually feel. Tired? Stressed? Carrying a bunch of unfinished mental loops? If yes, 15 minutes isn't giving up - it's being honest about your resources.\n\nThe drift itself is worth paying attention to. What kind of thought pulls you away - worry? boredom? something unfinished nagging at you? That pattern matters.",

I started doing shorter blocks on purpose, like 20 to 25 minutes, and telling myself drifting a bit is fine as long as I gently return. Also reducing friction helps more than motivation, fewer tabs open, phone in another room, one clear task written down. Over time those brief mental interruptions get quieter because you stop reacting to them. The 30 minutes comes almost as a side effect rather than something you wrestle with.",

I not only want to give you advice, but also help you on your journey. I think doing a dopamine detox is the cure for you, not a band-aid solution, because it will rewire your brain to be able to focus again, have the ability to do hard things, and ultimately enjoy more out of life. However, doing a dopamine detox can be incredibly hard with no experience. So as I said, I would love to help you with that because. Just message me if you want any help",

If you want to try a different approach that doesn't feel like a chore, I'd love to have you test it out.\n​Hang in there—your brain isn't broken, the tools just aren't built for us yet.\n\n[Flovia](http://www.flovia.app)",

Look, we're AI-native\n\n If I can replace your entire \"AI Logic\" with a 10-line Regex script or a simple SQL query, your product isn't Advanced. It's inefficient.\nI got into an argument about this recently where someone claimed that removing AI features is a \"downgrade\" for a startup. They argued it makes the product less relevant.\n\nThat is complete BS.\n\nRelevance for a startup isn't about using the shiny new toy. It's about survival. If you are burning $0.03 per request to do something a Python function does for free, you aren't cutting edge. You are just bad at math.\n\nThe  \"Upgrade\" in a startup isn't moving from SQL to Vector DB. It's moving from Burning Cash to \"Default Alive.\"\n\nIf you replace a slow, expensive, hallucinating LLM call with a boring, instant, free if/else statement, you didn't downgrade your tech. You upgraded your business model.\n\nWe need to stop glorifying complexity. A boring stack that costs $0 and runs instantly is superior to a \"Modern AI Stack\" that burns runway, purely for the sake of hype.\n\nAm I wrong?

      "text": "I used to think productivity was mostly mental. Discipline, mindset, motivation, all that. Lately though, that idea has started to feel incomplete. Ive noticed that how productive I feel has a lot to do with what Im surrounded by while Im working.  \n  \nMy setup wasnt bad, but it was loud in a way I didnt really notice at first. Too much clutter on the desk, too many cables visible, RGB everywhere which was too much for me. It was like too much for my brain to recieve, too much information and just really distracting.  \n  \nSo I started changing small things. I cleaned up the desk and removed anything that didnt need to be there. Set all the RGB to a single, softer color instead of cycling through everything. Switched my desktop wallpaper to something more neutral instead of something busy. I also replaced my desk with a standing one from greensoul so I wasnt locked into the same position all day, and paired it my old ergonomic chair from herman miller since I was still sitting for a good chunk of the time.  \n  \nNone of this made me magically more disciplined, but it made it easier to focus. The space feels calmer, and when the environment feels calmer, my head kind of follows. It made me realize that productivity might start less in your head and more in the space youre asking your head to exist in for hours every day.  \n  \nDo you feel more productive in calmer, simpler environments, or do you work better with more energy and visual stimulation around you?",

Do not at any point compare yourself. This is YOUR year. YOUR life’s curriculum. Very few people dedicate time to this like you are.\n- don’t get stuck on which scheduling tool to use but fyi I didn’t really like google calendar as a planning tool because it doesn’t allow me to check off tasks once I’ve done them and the interface looked cluttered when I scheduled my goals and checkpoints in. I ended up using excel, an analog habit tracker, and some other tools but use what works for you…it’ll ultimately be different for everyone \n\nAbove all rooting for you.

What are things you want to do more of, keep the same, and do less of? Look at journals and/or your calendar can be really helpful for this.  \n2. Some other life domains to consider from your list: Social / Community, Family, Romantic, Spiritual, Play  \n3. Do some reflection on each domain. What's going well? Where might you want to improve?  \n4. Think about your goals for the year broadly, both across domains and in general. For each goal, try to figure out what success looks like.  \n5. Ask yourself \"if I could only work on 1 goal, what would it be.\" Put that at the top of your list. Then do the same until you have a list of 3-5 goals that you know are your top priorities.  \n6. Also make a plan for Q1, using a similar process (review your yearly goals, and the things upcoming in the quarter, figure out how to move things forward that you want to for Q1).  \n7. At the beginning of each week, make a quick plan for your week to stay on track with Q1 goals.  \n8. At the beginning of each day, make a quick plan for your day to stay on track for the week.  \n9. At the beginning of Q2, review Q1, review your annual goals, review the upcoming quarter, and make a plan.\n\netc.\n\nI hope this helps!",

          "text": "I'd suggest starting small. First plan out your ideal, realistic week with a balance of your priorities and obligations. You can do this via time blocks in Google Calendar and make the events recurring each week, e.g. a 1 hour block for exercise or spending time upskilling.\n\nAs each day comes, review the blocks and move them around as needed. If something else pops up, no problem - just move or delete another block. By deleting something from your ideal week, you're making a conscious decision that the other event is more important. So it makes you think twice before saying \"yes\" to something silly.\n\nAfter a week of following this, revisit. What's working and what's not? Adapt the recurring blocks as needed.\n\nI'd also suggest adding major milestones to your calendar as well and keeping track of them via a year-view calendar. Your daily / weekly time blocks should directly help you progress towards those milestones. \n\nBest of luck!",

It can call emergency services for you if you’re unresponsive after a fall or after a car accident. I was skeptical about these things’ utility until I got them for my parents as a “I’ve fallen and I can’t get yo device.” Then I got one and found myriad useful things about it. Other people here recommending other things, but if you’re already in the Apple ecosystem you’ll really like it.",

It’s good for telling you when the environment is really loud, and I use it for sleep tracking.. my sleeping sucks but hey! \n\nI sometimes keep the display as “always on” but that eats battery life, so if i charge it as soon as i get home i turn always on display off and don’t have to charge it until the next day i get home. \n\nOverall it’s great especially if you plan on moving around, can’t always have your phone or just flat out forget your phone. Though you would have to get the gps/cellular option if you want to leave your phone. I sometimes do that if I’m running to the store. I can still listen to my music, take calls, and review notifications from email and messages.\n\nTo me it’s worth it. Only reason I got it was because there was a promotional deal. Added it to my phone plan and it was like $200 off. \n\nEnded up being a valuable part of my fitness journey + daily life.\n\nI currently have the series 8, 45mm, gps/cellular, which released 2022.",

As someone who is not always in turn with their body, it’s very helpful. Same with exercise tracking, it’s motivational for me to see my fitness stats. By far the most useful thing for me is the silent vibrating alarm, followed by the “find my iPhone” function. I set about a dozen alarms throughout the day sometimes, and I lose my phone a lot. \n\nI did silence most notifications though.

Often if the day is crowded I jot down estimated time for each thing, and if the math doesn't work, I see if I can strike something from that day.\n\nOther days, it includes some 'not urgent but important' thing I am working on.  It might only be a little chunk of that important thing, but daily or at least a few times a week, I'm looking at my larger lists and plucking things off that I can make progress on.",

It gets all those things out of my head where they don’t belong, and I can focus more easily.\n\nLet’s say you use pen and paper for your to do list. Then you have a place where you just dump all your todo items as you think of them. Then each day you choose 1-3 items that are either urgent or important and write those down somewhere else. \n\nAnd that’s it. You do those tasks then you can refer to the main list and do the less important stuff. \n\nThis of course can work digitally with any app you might be using. My main point is get stuff out of your head, and make e focused list each day for the important stuff",

This is really annoying but it works better than a reminder because you can't swipe it away, you have to go through the process of deleting the email as well. This helped me organise and get things done. \n\n\nGeneral tips are to chunk things into manageable amounts. Setting short term goals within a larger task can fuel the reward system and create a more tangible idea of the task; it's no longer a monolith but a smaller set of tasks comprising the whole. \n\n\nSometimes it's time to switch the fuck off too... If you've got brain fog, then you need a break and sometimes the best thing to do is write the remainder of the day off and start again after a good sleep. \n\n\nWorking environment - simplify everything around you so you're not surrounded by too many concepts clouding your thinking. \n\n\nIf you can learn to enjoy what you're doing, that's always a plus... If you're not happy doing the task, maybe you need to change what you're doing; we all resist and eventually grind to a halt when we feel imprisoned. \n\n\nSpend money - if I've got a busy work week and things around the house are going to shit, I sometimes get a cleaner. It's £40 well spent for the peace and tranquility around me. Same thing with the garden or other to-dos which I'll not be able to fulfill while I'm focusing on other priorities but will nag at me and lead to a sense of overwhelm. Spending money to save me time has helped me immensely. \n\n\nYou can go deeper into gantt charts if you really want to project plan your life. Strategising this way can help you visualise the sequence of your tasks, estimate time it will take and how you move from job to job. Excel has a free template built in. \n\n\nHope these help ",

Complex systems require complex maintenance.\n\nI've been developing productivity apps for quite some time and I come to realize how hard it is to design a proper UX and system even with allocated time, resources, and direct access to low-level tools (e.g., code), infrastructure, and technologies. I couldn't see that complexity when I was an end-user with some spare time inside the no-code tools I've been playing with, as I've been confusing ease of implementation with ease of design, so they slowly became a form of procrastination.\n\nIt's harder to outgrow a simple tool than people think, stating this as a neurodivergent. You might be outgrowing them if and only if you're already fairly productive but lacking efficiency, balance, or a higher standard you desire. In that case, identify specific issues and desired outcomes then find the simplest and minimal combination of tools to tackle them. There are specialized tools for anything.",

They take periodic photos of my spaces, use AI to find clutter, set small to-do tasks for cleaning up the area, and then \\*automatically\\* mark the to-do as complete when the next photo shows the task is done.\n\nLike as someone with ADHD/neurodivergence? they have really helped the few days I've had them so far with breaking things down into small tasks that feel less overwhelming.\n\nAs for total bullshit? I've tried so many of the habit tracker apps/planners that just turn into another nag I can't keep up with. I've learned that I should stop buying planners as I will not ever use them no matter how cute they are",

I've been guilty of the same thing I judge other people for - avoiding checkups until something feels wrong.

A lot of responses here highlight the balance between simplicity and staying engaged. Whether you’re paper‑first or digital‑first, one thing that helps a ton is being able to capture more than just “done/not done” — adding a bit of context around how you felt that day, what else was going on, or what events might’ve influenced your habits can make the patterns much clearer over time.\n\nFor some folks that insight is worth moving beyond checkmarks alone — it’s how you start to answer “why did this week go better than that one?” without manual analysis. Tools built around quick, flexible logging and trend views (e.g., habit + life context) make that easier without adding a ton of overhead. If that sounds useful for your style of tracking, consider checking out TrendSight — it’s designed to help you see those connections and build habits that stick: https://trendsight.app",

Just today I moved a workflow spreadsheet from Notion to a simple spreadsheet in OpenOffice because my easily distracted brain really cannot stay on task with something like Notion, a lot of the time. I end up exploring all the different options and possibilities rather than staying on task.  \nOn my personal time with some personal goals I like using Notion because it doesn't matter too much if get distracted and Notion does allow for some creativity.

Is there one small thing you can do? If it’s writing a paper, can you google some information for fifteen minutes, or write out the topic you want each paragraph to cover? Give yourself permission not to write the paper. If it’s a renovation project, can you make a list of tools that you need (and maybe even put the tools you need in one pile)? Maybe you could even make a list of things you still need to buy. \n\n5) Start in the middle. Trying to write a paper? Start with whatever paragraph you want to write, even if it’s not at the beginning or the end of the paper. Hell, start in the middle of a paragraph. Write your content without citing sources, or write down your sources without writing in the content (beyond a few words to tell you why you wrote that source down). Trying to declutter a space? Start with the stuff you’re interested in, not the stuff that would make things most efficient. Starting is more important than efficiency in this case. \n\n6) Set a timer for 25 minutes, and then after working for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break. Take a fifteen minute break every hour. This is called the Pomodoro method. Anyone can focus on anything for 25 minutes (or if not 25 minutes, then 15 minutes, or 10), and once you get started, it’s way easier to continue. Maybe you work for 10 minutes, and in that 10 minutes you draft the outline of your paper. Then you take a five to ten minute break, and then you work on the paper for another 25 minutes. Then you take a five to ten minute break, then work for another 25 minutes. And if you get started and don’t want to stop when your timer goes off (which always happened to me), you don’t have to - turn the timer off and keep going.",

Other things were piling up too and it got to the point I couldn’t do anything. \nI ended up having to say “only 1 minute” “only 5 minutes” “ just 2 minutes, make a plan for what I’ll do after having coffee”. Etc… \nStart with paper and pen and plan it out, use as much paper as needed, take your time.  Start with the end goal in mind and sort through the steps needed to get there.  Make broad general steps, then break those down a little further but not too detailed. Identify one task early on in those steps you can do in 5 to 10 minutes.  Do that task. Then look at the plan, identify another dmall task, think about it, plan what it needs, then do it right away. Only then take a break.  \nKeep doing this.  Over and over. \nIn the plan, a task you identified at first is very broad, like “write chapter 3” or it’s “install the bathtub” then when you get there break that task down, but don’t do that until you’re at that step!  That’s where the overwhelming is coming from, the enormity of the complete project.  You need to do little steps that add up to bigger things. \n\nAlso, ignore that 2 months have passed, this will eat at you.  You must look only at the time ahead and think-plan-do over and over in small chunks. Once you are thinking about it and doing things that you plan towards the goal the more the ‘wall’ keeping you from starting will erode, once a little is done you’ll find it becomes easier to do a little more.",

I get great sleep with around 7h30-8h of sleep and go to bed fairly consistently between 23:00-00:00. I have things to do such as work and get ready yet I can't get myself out of bed I might either hit snooze for 2 hours straight or I'll just find ways to entertain myself in bed (pause). The thing of putting my phone on the opposite side of the room doesn't work because I will just go back to bed again.

I suggest trying to go to bed a bit earlier, to be able to catch the growth hormone activity period (22:00-02:00h) and get up earlier. You can try to find something you can look forward to in the morning - early coffee and a tasty breakfast did it for me (nothing big, and nothing too sweet and heavy - just something light, but different each day that you prepare yourself, so you have something to occupy your attention with other than a phone). Get your body working by drinking water first thing in the morning. Put on some music and try to do light stretches to get it moving - our body needs constant reminders of what it was built for. I found stretching helps a lot, especially if you work in a quiet sitting environment all day, and it might even lead to being brave to try light morning exercise. You can take a short walk before work; do small chores around the house (so it looks cozier and more inviting when you come home to it in the afternoon). The online \"life\" is way more interesting than our everyday boring routine, but if you try to break it and maybe add a friend to contact, to share a good morning chat, mornings can be made fun too. It worked wonders for me. \nAnd if nothnig helps, do consider consulting an internal medicine specialist - some blood work, an ultrasound of the thyroid and hormone levels might give a clue as to why you might be drawn to that bed for so long.",

Issue is that 8-9 hours of sleep doesn’t cut for me so I’ll return to my bed after turning off alarm and sleep or rest in bed.

Miss one day and you’ll miss a second and a third and before you know it a month has gone by.\n\nI never found a hack - going to the gym and being fit and healthy was worth the daily feeling of not wanting to get up.

That method is good for storing life events and self reflection, but not for formal, logical thought.   \n\nYou don’t need to write in paragraphs or in your “speaking voice”. Literally just jot down incomplete sentences about your main arguments. The key pieces of logic or evidence that you build your position from. Let it sit for a day, then come back and reread it. You can then spot holes where you’re lacking evidence/arguments, refine it, and repeat.   \n\nThis is what I’ve done when writing my PhD dissertation. It’s amazing how flawed your logic can be when it’s in your head; you have to get it written down and give yourself time to think about other things so you come back with a fresh perspective.",

Reels, random snaps, nothing I even cared about.\n\nWhat really made it hard to ignore was actually looking at my screen time. I always assumed it was not that bad, but seeing the hours added up was kind of brutal. At that point I couldn’t really pretend it wasn’t a problem anymore.\n\nI didn’t do anything extreme after that. Just small changes. Leaving my phone in another room when I needed to focus. Not touching social apps first thing in the morning so my brain wasn’t fried before I even started the day. Checking screen time once in a while just to keep myself honest.\n\nIt all sounds pretty basic, but it made a bigger difference than I expected. I’m still not perfect and I still get distracted, but I’m not stuck in that half-working, half-scrolling state all the time anymore. When I sit down to work now, I actually get into it sometimes.\n\nFeels like actual progress for once.\n\n",

      "text": "I started looking at digital calendars because I wanted something that could genuinely reduce the day-to-day friction in our household: routines, chores, schedules, reminders, all the stuff that usually lives in people’s heads and turns into constant nudging. The goal wasn’t anything fancy, just making things easier to see and less mentally exhausting to manage.That search is what eventually led me to skylight. On the surface, it seemed like a good fit. A shared screen, a simple interface, and a product clearly marketed toward families. But once we actually started using it, the gaps became noticeable pretty quickly.\n\n1. One of the biggest letdowns was the chores and rewards feature. With kids, this was a major reason we were interested in a digital calendar in the first place. Making responsibilities visual and trackable sounds genuinely useful. But realizing that this feature requires an additional subscription immediately took the wind out of it for me. When a core household workflow only works if you keep paying for it, that’s not reducing friction, it’s just shifting it somewhere else.\n2. The same pattern showed up with the photo frame functionality. We were hoping it could also serve as a shared photo display, something passive that just updates on its own in the background. That, too, is locked behind a subscription. At that point, it became hard to ignore the pattern: many of the features that make the device feel complete aren’t actually part of what you’re buying upfront.\n\nSo at its base price, skylight is essentially just a digital calendar screen. Anything beyond that either isn’t there or comes with ongoing fees. From a productivity standpoint, that’s a tough tradeoff. You’re paying premium hardware pricing for something that doesn’t replace existing systems, doesn’t reduce ownership overhead, and doesn’t really adapt unless you keep unlocking features over time.\nOnce I stepped back and looked at alternatives, it became hard to justify. For the same amount of money, you could set up a tablet with a custom dashboard, calendar, photos, reminders, even smart home controls and actually tailor it to how your household works, without subscriptions quietly creeping into basic functionality. From a productivity perspective, I’d avoid skylight. Not because the idea itself is bad, but because the execution leans too heavily on subscriptions and not enough on actually reducing cognitive load and coordination costs.",

Imagine if you need to pull your boat in from rough seas but it is cold and driving rain and you cannot be bothered. Suddenly a bee or wasp stings you! Ow! You spring into action and feel a surge to go and get the boat in NOW! my guess is it can work a bit like that? Linking the circuits.\n\nAlso on a more abstract answer, “do you really know something if you still do not do it when you know it is right?” Maybe something is still missing so check what that might be?\n\nMy personal answer: I think I have hypersensitivity issues so noise can stop me thinking clearly for example. Then I also need to build a system around me that I can connect to then within that I can do actions. If there is too much randomness and chaos it is like too much “white noise“ and it stops me proceeding.\n\nSo setting up a system which you train yourself in repeatedly which you like training at as well as executing for the required result imho is a powerful way to correct this? Does help if you like the “training and improving” aspect of whatever you are also doing.",

People resisted but afterwards realised just what they had taken on and how it was more important than they thought. We now have over 99% adherence to that process.

      "text": "I used to believe productivity was only about discipline wake up early, follow routines, use the right apps, stay consistent no matter what. But over time I noticed a pattern whenever I was mentally drained, stressed, or carrying things silently, productivity became harder no matter how “perfect” my system was. I wasn’t lazy, I wasn’t lacking motivation, I was just trying to function with a mind that was overloaded. Once I started treating my mental health like the base layer of productivity, everything began to shift. It sounds simple, but it’s real you can’t build strong habits on top of a tired mind and expect it to hold. What actually helped wasn’t some magical method. It was small self work that made me feel human again. I started doing tiny resets writing down what’s bothering me instead of letting it spin in my head, breaking big tasks into one clear step, taking breaks without guilt, and setting goals that fit my energy instead of punishing myself for not doing “enough.” I also learned that self improvement isn’t supposed to feel like constant pressure. Growth is slow, and consistency comes from being kind enough to keep going. The more I stopped attacking myself, the easier it became to show up daily. Something else I didn’t expect: productivity gets lighter when you’re not doing it alone. Having even a few people around you who care about improving who share ideas, keep each other accountable, and remind you that you’re not the only one trying changes everything. It’s not about depending on others, it’s about being in an environment where motivation feels natural instead of forced. Sometimes one honest conversation or one supportive message is enough to bring you back to yourself. I’m curious: when you feel stuck, is it usually because your schedule is messy or because your mind is tired? And what’s one habit, mindset, or small change that actually helped you improve without feeling like you’re constantly fighting yourself?",

I would try to not immediately jump to, \"but we can't do that or we'd be lazy/unproductive/unworthy/etc\". I would do this whenever I feel stuck. Personally, I like talking long walks in nature with my partner, it feels like conversation feels much better outside while we're moving. Then, I come home, and I write down what I remember of what we talked about, the insights and ideally actionable points I've gotten out of the conversation. \n\nOften, the part of ourselves that's resisting something does it out of a sense of misplaced self-preservation. It's scared that if we do the thing, we will suffer in some way, and it's trying to protect us. Being able to suspend judgement allows this part to bubble up to the surface, so to speak, and to find ways to soothe it so that it doesn't keep up stuck. It's way less tiring to move forward with things when your whole self is in alignment, as I am sure you have noticed by now :)\n\nI started typing an example but then worried that this comment was already way too long.
