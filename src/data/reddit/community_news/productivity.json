It’s so normal now that nobody even questions it.\n\nJust endless scrolling through bad news, reels, tweets, notifications every few minutes, comparing your life to random people online, constant FOMO. It’s exhausting but somehow feels impossible to stop. You don’t even realize how much it messes with your focus, mood, relationships, everything.\n\nI’ve tried setting limits. I’ve tried uninstalling apps. I’ll stay off for a few days, maybe a week if I’m lucky, and then suddenly I’m back to scrolling like nothing changed. No decision, just autopilot.\n\nThe worst part is people don’t take it seriously. If you say your screen time is out of control or that you’re stuck on your phone, people laugh it off or say “same.” But this actually feels like a real problem, just quieter and completely normalized.\n\nAnyone else feel this way?\n\nDo you even try to control it, or have you just accepted it at this point?\n\nWould genuinely like to hear how other people deal with this, or if anyone else feels equally stuck.",

In the morning, I go for a long walk without my phone, just got into the hang of enjoying the nature's real beauty. Evening, I play a sport for a while and do some workout. \n\nAnd after getting back home, I literally spend time with my family. Sometimes, we don't know what to speak to a life partner after years of marriage. But, I met a couple who will take their cup of coffee and sit outside their balcony for some time every day and just talk about random things and build conversations with that. For example, just saying 'that house has a beautiful structure'. From there the conversations begin and go for sometime. And yes, it is interesting. \n\nNow, it has started feeling like a lot of no screen time is coming my way!",

              "text": "This is a tricky question because there are many different areas at the moment where AI might plausibly impact productivity. Let's go through a few...\n\nIn the world of computer programming, AI-supported tab-complete in code generation is clearly a time-saver. Vibe coding, by contrast, is more complicated. It produces working software faster than a human can do, so in that sense it increases productivity. But it's unclear to what degree vibe coded software will play a significant role in software development.\n\nWhen it comes to knowledge workers using chatbots, there are isolated use-cases where it clearly makes things more efficient (think: a journalist being able to accurately auto-transcribe an interview). But there are not as many such use cases yet as I would have expected. Using it to write emails or create slide show drafts is creating a lot of \"workslop\" that might be fast to produce but not actually that useful.\n\nAgents aren't ready for prime time yet outside the context of the terminal. They might never be. (I published an article about this for the New Yorker last month.)\n\nFor students, using chatbots to cheat -- e.g., produce answers for problem sets -- is clearly increasing productivity in some strict value-less sense of the word. Last year I wrote an article where I followed students using chatbots to help them write papers. Interestingly, the way they used them (which included lots of back-and-forth conversations) probably made it take longer to write the papers, but also made the experience feel less cogntively demanding.  i\n\n  \nTo me, the real productivity gains are yet to come. They will happen when people leave the chatbot interface and get custom tools, powered by RL-tuned LLMs, that are integrated into software tools where they do a small amount of automated efforts really well.",

Leave it in your dorm to study. Go on a hike or walk without it. This helps break the mental loop in which boredom is always immediately rewarded with a digital diversion; (3) Aggressively seek out alternative activities and commitments with which to add meaning and diversion to your life. Make your analog life, in other words, so rich that the phone begins to pale by comparison.\n\n  \n(I'm actually writing a book now called THE DEEP LIFE, which seems oddly self-help-ey for someone like me who typically writes about taming technology.

But when you do have enough capital is exactly when your employer won't want to lose you and will keep finding ways to keep you in their pipeline. \n\nA good test for leaving is whether or not people will give you money. That is, are customers buying your product, are other employers offering you a good salary? People will be quick to praise your plan, but they want offer you money unless what you're doing actually seems valuable.",

              "text": "There are two relevant skills here: workload management and work management.\n\nThe latter (work management) is how you organize the things you're already actively working on. Here it's helpful to use standard knowledge work productivity ideas. For example: \n\n \\- Time-block plan your day instead of being reactive  \n \\- Avoid collaboration through ad hoc messaging. If a message can't be answered in a single reply, then move the conversation to a phone call or person discussion.  \n \\- Implement processes to make work on recurring types of tasks more predictable and less interruptive.  \n \\- Implement full capture (never keep track of things only in your head).  \n \\- To ensure you're giving people reasonable time line expectations for the tasks you accept, try actually scheduling the time on your calendar, in advance, for when you'll complete the work you just accepted. This will help you quickly assess when you actually do have time to get things done.  \n  \\- protect time for actual work from meetings. This could mean having set hours protected every day, or you could practice the rule that everytime you schedule a meeting you have to schedule the same amount of time for deep work somewhere in that same week. \n\n  \nThe former skill (workload management) is about how you manage the number of things you agree to work on in the first place. This is a major focus of my book Slow Productivity. I think this is a new frontier in knowledge work productivity: turning our focusing from how to manage our work to how to manage what we allow to become our work.",

Sometimes I'll binge maker videos with my kids.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that fandoms are a great way to introduce more meaningful fallbacks when exhausted by life.

      "text": "I,'ve spent the last few years stuck in a cycle of \"morning rot.\" I’d be awake, but I would just lie there. My mind would be racing with guilt about my freelance work or the Excel skills I needed to learn, but I felt physically hijacked by old patterns.\n​I finally realized that the more I messed with my mind (criticizing myself, feeling guilty), the more I got stuck. As Sadhguru says, \"The mind is a survival tool, not a liberation tool.\" My mind was just doing its job staying in the \"safe\" loop of the bed.\n\n​I stopped fighting the effect (my thoughts) and started working on the cause: my nervous system. Here is the 2-minute \"Somatic Loop\" I use to actually get to my desk:\n\n​The Toe-to-Head Tension: While still under the covers, I tense my toes for 5 seconds, then release. I work my way up through my calves, thighs, stomach, and face. It manually signals to the body that the \"sleep loop\" is over. It’s like a jump-start for your energy (Prana).\n\n​Sensory Closure: Once I stand up, I immediately splash cold water on my face, feet, and arms. This sensory input tells my brain the \"Lazy Phase\" is officially finished.\n\n​The \"Unfolding\" Goal: I don't think about my freelance projects yet. I just tell myself to unfold my yoga mat. Once that mat is open, my body recognizes the \"Active Loop.\" Taking that one tiny physical initiative makes the rest of the day follow naturally.\n\n​Life is a phenomenon, not a thing to be fixed. Stop criticizing yourself for being \"unproductive.\" You aren't lazy; you’re just stuck in a survival loop. Take responsibility for your physical energy first, and the focus will follow.",

It’s already helping a lot because I can visually see where my time and energy are actually going.\n\nI got the idea from a Charlie Morgan productivity video on YouTube who credits Steve Ovens for it. Not sure which exact video it was exactly, but the system stuck.\n\nHow it works\n\n\\-One main dashboard sheet The full year is broken down into months and grouped into Q1 Q2 and so on. Next to it there’s a key with two columns. one for color and one for the main task or category that color represents. You fill each day on the yearly calendar with colors based on what you worked on. This makes it easy to see what you spent most of the year doing and whether it was actually worth it.\n\n\\-Monthly sheets There are 12 separate sheets, one for each month. Each day has around 5 empty rows where you write that day’s to do list. Tasks can be moved around easily and color coded.\n\n\\-Simple feedback system If a task that absolutely needed to be done that day wasn’t completed, you mark it red. If you complete a task, you mark it green. By the end of the month you can clearly see how much red vs green there is and assess whether you actually did what you said you would or just stayed busy.",

          "text": "Man, I really appreciate you sharing what worked for you, especially the walks and the app blocker, those are solid habits. But I have to push back on the 'instant noodles every couple of days' part.\n\nIf you're dealing with *severe* brain fog, those noodles might be doing more damage than you think. They are basically a giant bowl of refined carbs, sodium, and preservatives that spike your blood sugar and then leave you crashing. It’s hard to have mental clarity when your insulin is on a roller coaster (trust me I know!).\n\nInstead of just 'minimizing' junk, I’d look into how specialized nutrition can actually repair that fog. For example, some people have had incredible results using products from revgenetics. They focus on things like high-purity Resveratrol and NMN, which actually support mitochondrial health and cellular energy, but its not like an instant caffeine kick... nonono...  When your cells are actually firing correctly, the fog doesn't just 'clear', it stays away because you've addressed the biological root, not just the habits. But even that stuff wont work well if you are stuck with minimum nutrient deficiencies... I have to comeback to the instant noodles... they taste good, but holy cow they are a nutritional black hole... look, eat eggs, try them daily. I have been poor af, and at least they helped top me up where I needed it most. You may not have $$ for steak, so eat them eggs.\n\nThe 'external brain' and long walks are great for managing the noise, but don't underestimate how much better your brain will perform if you give it premium fuel and targeted supplements instead of just trying to 'survive' on processed stuff. Keep at it, though, the consistency is definitely the hardest part!",

Around mid-afternoon I noticed I was bouncing between tasks, checking things off, but not really finishing anything cleanly.\n\nNormally I’d respond by tightening up. Pomodoro timer, stricter list, less “wasted” time. Instead, I did the opposite. I left my desk, made coffee, and sat there for five minutes doing absolutely nothing. No phone, no planning, no optimizing.\n\nWhen I came back, I finished the next task faster than I expected. And the one after that. It wasn’t because I found some secret trick, it was because my brain had stopped resisting. I realized how much of my productivity problem comes from constantly trying to force output instead of letting focus reset naturally.\n\nI still plan my day and I still care about getting things done. I even keep money set aside from myprize so I don’t feel pressure to grind every minute just to feel secure. But I’ve started leaving intentional gaps instead of packing everything tight, and weirdly, more gets finished.\n\nI think I confused being busy with being effective for a long time.

      "text": "ok so this started as a dumb experiment and turned into something that genuinely changed how my days feel.\n\nAbout a month ago I got frustrated because I kept running late in the mornings even though I swore my routine only took 45 minutes. Like, I KNEW it was 45 minutes. I’d done it a thousand times.\n\nSo I decided to actually time it. Every single step. For 30 days straight.\n\nDay 1 result: 1 hour 22 minutes.\n\nI was almost double what I thought. And honestly? That pissed me off enough to keep tracking.\n\nWhere the missing 37 minutes were hiding???\n\nThe biggest one was transition time. The gap between finishing one thing and actually starting the next. Like, I’d finish breakfast and then just… stand in the kitchen for a bit. Check my phone. Wander to the bathroom. Start getting dressed but realize I need to pick something out first.\n\nEach of those gaps was 3-7 minutes. Doesn’t sound like much but I had 6 of them in my morning. That’s 25-30 minutes of basically nothing.\n\nThe second thing was variance. Some tasks were super consistent — making coffee was always about 4 minutes, showering was always 10-12 minutes. But picking what to wear? Anywhere from 2 minutes to literally 18 minutes one day when I couldn’t find a clean shirt and then changed my mind twice.The high-variance stuff is what destroys your schedule. You can’t plan around something that takes anywhere from 2-18 minutes.\n\nThird thing: the “quick check” tax. Every morning I’d squeeze in like 4-5 “quick” things — check slack, reply to a text, look at the weather, scroll instagram for “one sec.” Each one was 2-3 minutes but I was doing it almost unconsciously. That’s another 10-15 minutes I never accounted for.\n\nWhat I actually changed:\n\nAfter seeing the data for a couple weeks, the fix was pretty obvious. I rebuilt my morning with honest times and a locked sequence:Wake up + stretch —5 min, Shower — 12 min,Get dressed (clothes picked the night before, this was the big one):3 mins,Breakfast, same thing every weekday, overnight oats — 8 min, look at my 3 priorities for today — 5 min,grab stuff and go — 7 min,Buffer because life happens — 5 min\n\nTotal: 45 minutes. But like, a REAL 45 minutes this time.\n\nI tried timing with my phone stopwatch for the first few days and it was annoying as hell. Tried Toggl but that felt too work-y for a morning routine. Tried a spreadsheet and lasted about 4 days before I stopped filling it in.\n\nWhat actually worked for me was a routine timer app — you set up the steps once and then just tap through them each morning. It shows you the full sequence as a visual timeline so you can see where you are and what’s coming. The thing that surprised me was having it on my Lock Screen. I just glance at my phone and see “step 4 of 7, 3 minutes left” without opening anything. It sounds small but it removed this constant “wait what am I supposed to do next” friction that I didn’t even realize I had. Not a magic wand I found to solve all my problems at once but definitely a significant jump wrt kind of solutions I found earlier.\n\nBiggest takeaway:\n\nWe are TERRIBLE at estimating how long our own routines take. Like embarrassingly bad. But once you have actual data, fixing the routine is almost easy. The problem was never motivation or discipline. It was just… bad information. I was building my entire morning around a number (45 min) that was completely fictional. Of course I was always running late.\n\nAnyway that’s it. Genuinely curious — has anyone else actually timed their routines like this? What was the gap between what you expected and what was real? I feel like this can’t just be me lol",

They are also usually used to denote a new segment in the text, where some main selling point it brought up. \n\n-most LLM slop ends with a call to action, like “anyone out there experience the same?”, “I’m curious, what do you guys think?” - I usually scroll to the end first to look for those question marks in the final lines. Big telltale sign! \n\nThere’s a ton more, like, speaking in three’s, the whole piece having a listicle quality to it, often there’s also some advertisement for some app or product embedded in there. \n\nIt’s a lot.

Time box everything so there’s no time to overthink. You’ve already done that. Plus it gives you a point to look forward to. Then it’s time for action. \nFirst thing in the morning, I ask myself “do I want to be the same tomorrow or be greater?” Then I have to answer out loud so my next action matches what I said. It would look weird to say one thing and do the opposite. Just one action towards your goal everyday is all you need. Even if it’s just walk 20mins to lose weight or fill out an application for school and save it as a draft, that’s all you need. \nWhen you do it first in the morning, it sets the tone for the day. After a while, it becomes part of your morning ritual. Plus, why wouldn’t you spend the first moments of consciousness in the morning on yourself.\nWorried about failing? So what! Do it fast and early so you can learn from it and have a better run the next round.\nIf you need help with planning, plug your ideas in ChatGPT to get you started.\nIf anything, remember its not a race so enjoy the journey of becoming a better you :-)",

And I learnt this from a Youtuber called HealthyGamer. \n\n**Step 1: Every morning, I start by listing out my tasks.** \n\nTasks should contain, Description so I understand what I have to do, the Outcomes of the task, and Deadline. \n\nI make sure I have at least 3-5 tasks per day. The task needs to be specific.  \nExample:   \nStudy for SAT exam **- Is not specific enough**  \nStudy Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - **is Specific enough for me.** \n\n**Step 2: Know the Outcomes.** \n\nThe outcomes need to be specific too!\n\nTask: Study Fundamental Theorem of Calculus  \nOutcomes: 1. Understand how differentiation and integration are connected  \n2. Understand how to solve area and accumulation problems easily.  \n\n\nClear outcomes define the success criteria of your task.\n\n**Step 3: Perform task for 2 mins**\n\nI clearly know that learning FTC will take me a few hours. But I do it for 2 mins. I don't stop at 2 mins, but i tell myself, all you need to do is perform this task for 2 mins. I convince myself that i can do this in 2 mins and start. But I always forget that i had a 2 minute timer and work on it without having to stop. If i do hit a wall, I tell myself, I will try for 2 mins, If it work it works, but always end up finishing the task. \n\n**Step 4: Finish the 3-5 tasks every single day.**\n\nMost tasks which we think will take hours can be completed in under 2 mins. Think about it, for you to have a productive day all you need to do is finish 5 tasks which generally task 2 mins. 10 mins of effort is all you need to keep moving forward! You can still keep scrolling for hours, but you just need to finish 5 tasks, gain the 5 outcomes before you do it. \n\n  \nThis is what I try to do every day. And it has helped me immensely. Heck, the reason I am typing about this is because i had it as a task. It took me 10 mins to type this, but I told myself it'll only take 2.",

The weird thing is, once I started filling some of my scroll time with 5-minute interactive lessons on random topics I was curious about, I naturally started scrolling less. It's like my brain got more engaged and needed the dopamine hit from TikTok less? Idk if that makes sense but it genuinely helped break the pattern for me.",

It helped. I save way less now.

ADD and just the digital quickness of life now, makes it really hard to focus on one article, on one task and so it feels like saving it for later will work.   Alas. no.   I do find Reddit extremely helpful, in finding that you are not alone really in anything, so it turns out. And that so many fellow humans have great advice and thoughts on how to proceed, change and just acknowledge.  It's OKAY.   \n\n This may lead into more of a separate post question ... Especially when you realize you are the \"older person,\" ie. early 50s. I have physical hoarded things and now digitally.  I used Evernote for a long time and really loved it, it seems to have everything, I could at least \"hoard,\" in one place, instead of bookmarks, notes, etc. etc.   However, now it is a paid cloud thing, and I don't know...is there anything out there that can be used, where the things are saved on your desktop, not the cloud?  My evernote account was constantly being hacked or attempted log ins.  So I stopped using it. But really it was the closest thing to keeping things organized.     I continually \"search,\" on the compute because like you, I know the info is there....but oh where oh where did I put it?  Safari, Google or Firefox, notes, post its or a word doc. etc.      Am I just \"too old,\" in thinking there is some app/software that can be used off line, not only cloud based?",

      "text": "TL;DR- meditation helped me realise what living in the moment means.\n\nI was really fed up with my procrastination and overthinking problems. Whenever I tried to study or sit down to do my work, I would just start procrastinating. I would end up watching reels or thinking about random stuff. Other times, while just sitting there, I would go completely blank and get consumed in my thoughts.\n\nThese problems were making it really difficult for me to do anything. I was constantly stuck in a position where I wanted to work hard and focus on my studies, but because of all this overthinking about the future, what will happen, whether I will get a job or not, it kept hampering my studies.\n\nThis kept going on until I realized something. Around that time, I started meditating to improve my focus and to get some distance from my thoughts. And honestly, it turned out to be a wonderful decision.\n\nIt’s been six months now, and one of the most beautiful realizations that helped me overcome my overthinking and procrastination was this. All we really have is this moment. There is no past or future in the way we imagine it. What we call the future is something we only ever experience as the present. We never actually experience the future as future. All thoughts about it stay in our head. Experientially, we can only live in the present.\n\nThis realization might sound simple. I had heard it so many times before, live in the moment, focus on the present, but I could never really digest it. I just wasn’t able to grasp it. I’ve also heard this from Sadhguru, that “In reality, there is only now. If you know how to handle this moment, you know how to handle eternity.” But earlier, it stayed as just a quote for me.\n\nMeditation did something different. It was like it planted this understanding inside me. After meditating, this was no longer just a thought. It became real for me. It became a realization.\nAnd naturally, I was able to focus on what was in front of me. I stopped constantly thinking about what would happen in the future. I just knew that all I can do is work now. That’s what is in my hands. What I cannot do, I anyway won’t be able to do. But what I can do, I don’t want to miss it. So I'll do whatever I can.\n\nThis helped me a lot. Just felt like sharing this.\n\nThank you for reading.",

Is that necessary for you , do you have time , are you ready to spend you time on it ? And be satisfied from it , at some time I started to think like this and now I feel wow! I have changed",

I like how you described the shift from knowing the idea of living in the present to actually experiencing it. That is a big difference. Meditation seems to create that small gap between you and your thoughts, where you can choose to just do what is in front of you instead of fighting your mind. Focusing on what you can do right now, and letting go of what you cannot control yet, sounds like a much healthier way to approach productivity. Thanks for sharing this so honestly.",

I can't stay consistent, I struggle with discipline, and I'm really frustrated with myself.\n\nBecause of this, I make a lot of mistakes at work, or I just don't understand things because l'm so exhausted. The biggest reason is that I don't really have anything to look forward to in the morning, so i do a bed time revenge procrastination because bed time is the only way to do my own things.

I charge mine in another room now. the 10 seconds of walking to check it is usually enough friction to break the impulse.",

It's a lot easier to slowly build up habits over years than to try to make a bunch of huge changes at once.\n* Go easy on myself. If I feel like I screwed up (by doing too much organizing and burning out, by not getting enough done etc.) I just don't let it bother me. It has never helped me to beat myself up over anything.\n* Set time limits. If you want to completely overhaul something and it will take many hours, just spend 15 minutes on it every day or two instead of using your entire day to knock it out. Really this is about prioritizing. If your work is the most important part of your day, don't spend your entire day organizing things. Spend a bit of it organizing things and the rest working.\n* Pay attention to my energy levels and learn to rest. I also have ADHD so it is important to manage my stimulant dosage on top of my focus and my sleep. And I have found there is little reason to try to force myself to get things done when I am burned out. It's better to rest to get more done later.\n* Meditation has been the most important habit for me. It helps you to see exactly how your mind works, which lets you deal with these types of things with more wisdom.\n\nHope some of that helps!",

It's made me realize that tackling the big task will make my day 10x easier instead of me dreading doing the task, not doing the task, and then getting even more stressed out about the task. I only figured this out by realizing that my habit and mood tracker would reveal when I didn't do this exercise.

There are some passion projects I like to work on, such as learning chess or spending more time with my son. To make time for them, I decided to plan my time and priorities much more effectively. So I picked up a system called the 12-week year, which gives you an entire structure for setting your goals, using time, creating weekly plans, and so on. ",

          "text": "I use a couple different methods. One method is my journal. It’s really an everything journal, which started out as a bullet journal, and then I just write everything in it, but because I put it in a binder and my binder fills up, I am forced to remove the pages and put them on a shelf finder. So I decided that I would do that once a month, and when I do that, I review all the pages. So when I brain dump my ideas and thoughts into my journal, no matter how scattered they are, when I go through my monthly review, I will catch them and check them, and if it is a thought that I want to carry over, I will write it down on my review page.\n\nMy other way of organizing my thoughts is using ChatGPT. I utilize this most often at the end of the day, before bed. I will dictate into a chat, whatever is on my mind, kind of like journaling, and I just dump all my thoughts, including ideas. And then when I read back the response, it generates new thoughts and ideas in my head, it’s almost like a brainstorming session with myself. I then keep those thoughts into different chats, which I organize in projects in ChatGPT. And then I might name the chat something to keep track of it. Sometimes I will tell the chat to remind me later about it and it will a week later. Send me an email about the idea if it is something I want to do later.\n\nOther ways include the Notes app in my phone. Sometimes I just think of an idea, and then I open up the Notes app in my phone and dictate into it. It’s similar to ChatGPT, but there’s no feedback. I use that less now than I used to, because I find getting the feedback from ChatGPT to be more beneficial. What’s nice about the Notes app though is you can organize it into folders and you can use hashtags and other ways to track and organize the ideas and thoughts.\n\nA final idea I’ve never used but have been wanting to try is Zettelkasten. it involves 3 x 5 cards that you can organize in different boxes or drawers. It is an established method and it seems to really work.",

I used to eat healthy and wake up early and eat good,read books, now i dont do anything of this\n\nNow i already know the path i should take, i know that distractions are the enemy, and the solution is not to stop it entirely but take them in moderation, but just to make the process quick and benefit more quickly from it, i am thinking of, going hard core this week, like no junk food at all, wake upat 6 or 7 am, no phone until 2pm unless i have an arrangement or somthing special that needs the phone, and push myself to any thing that is beneficial bht also uncomfortable life cold showers or gym at not preferable times if i didnt get to go to gym in a good time, just to build some discipline more, i also think of doing a list of things i want to do and then ordering them and giving them their timeline in the day to do them, i used to do this before but not anymore, what other things you guys suggest to add?\n\nAlso, how long would it take to get back to a semi normal state?

However this can be dramatically different depending on the difficulty of the habit you're trying to form.\n\nYou have exactly the right question, which is putting the emphasis on re-wiring the brain. Habits are **neurological**, so you have to train your nervous system. It's the same system you would need to learn a new language or an instrument. It takes time, practice, and dedication to see results.\n\nSomething like drinking 2 liters of water a day may only take 2-3 weeks to make a habit. Going to the gym 3 times a week may take 2-3 months. Studying two hours a day, everyday, may take 4-6 months.\n\nIn the early stages, when you're building the habit, you'll feel it. It takes effort, even if it doesn't feel like much, and it may be very uncomfortable. It's part of the process, but remember that you have to **remember to show up**. When it's in your nervous system (i.e. your brain is rewired), it becomes **nearly automatic**. It's no longer difficult. It's not even easy. It just becomes part of your routine. You'll know you got to this point because you'll feel uncomfortable **not** going to the gym or studying.\n\nThe most important part of this process is **staying motivated**. Start small and rack up little wins daily. For example, if you're starting a gym program, start with short programs with lighter weight. This will not only get you moving, it will mitigate injury in the process. 20-30 minutes just being in the gym, pumping 5 pound weights will give you the confidence to say to yourself, \"**I can do this**.\" Build from there. Don't be afraid to **half ass it**. If you can't do the whole, do a quarter, even a tenth. The name of the game is **keep showing up**. Don't beat yourself up or punish yourself for needing a break or not doing the whole program. You can rest, but **don't quit**. It will help if you document your progress and keep [SMART goals](https://www.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/IC-SMART-Goals-Worksheet-9237-PDF.pdf).\n\nTrust and believe in the process and yourself, go easy on yourself, stay determined, and you'll outpace 99% of those around you. Best of luck, fellow internet stranger. I really hope you find your stride.",

It's not about reaching half of what you used to do, it's about when will you be consistent again. In the beginning you might have a really good day and go back to slacking the next.

I’ve had years of setbacks with my career and mental health. I’m finally doing an MSc in Computing while also doing a remote internship, but I still feel behind in life, no stable job, small social circle, no hobbies, and honestly just feeling stuck.\n\nThere’s a girl I’ve been following on social media for years. She’s from the same cultural and religious background as me, which already makes her feel “familiar.” But her lifestyle is the complete opposite of mine. She’s successful in tech, confident, travelling with friends, partying, wearing revealing clothes, always looking stunning, featured in online videos about IT, living a life that seems full of independence and freedom.\n\nI don’t know her. I’ve never spoken to her. But I end up obsessively checking her social media, sometimes even looking at her family members or friends just to see more photos of her. It feels creepy and unhealthy, and I hate that I’m doing it. It’s like I’m obsessed to this fantasy version of her life.\n\nMeanwhile, I’m struggling with my own identity and direction. Instead of focusing on myself, I’m scrolling through her life and feeling worse about my own. It’s messing with my confidence, making me feel like a failure, and I can’t seem to stop.\n\nI want to break out of this cycle. I want to stop checking her profiles and actually focus on getting my life together, my health, my career, my hobbies, anything. But the obsession keeps pulling me back, especially when I feel lonely or frustrated.\n\nHow do you stop obsessing over someone you don’t know?  \nAny advice would be appreciated.",

Every time you think about checking her profile, or reading about someone you’ll inevitably compare yourself to, do something that will benefit YOU. Seriously. \n\nWhenever you feel that urge to check her profile, force yourself to use the time to learn something new about your field, find an event or party or even just a new place to go to (since you’ve mentioned wanting to be more social), etc. Envision the best version of yourself every single day, and figure out how you can work towards being that person with daily tasks, because right now it feels like an ideal instead of a plan with actionable steps.

So I get out of bed to turn off the alarm and thinking to sleep again but once I reach the bathroom it’s easy for me to convince myself on washing my face and that just wakes me up. \n\nYou can try placing a motivational quote in the bathroom as well if reaching there won’t be enough for you.
