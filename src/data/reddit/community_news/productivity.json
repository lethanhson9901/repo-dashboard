      "text": "I’ve always been the kind of person who knows what needs to be done but just doesn’t start. The list lives in my head, gets heavier and heavier, and then I freeze.\n\nA few weeks ago my boyfriend noticed this pattern and offered to help. He literally sits with me and says one step at a time what to do, and I just do it. If I hesitate or start drifting, he breaks it down even smaller until there’s zero thinking required on my end.\n\nAt first I felt kind of silly needing this level of hand-holding, but wow it works way better than anything I’ve tried. There’s something incredibly calming about not having to decide what to do next. I just follow instructions like a NPC and suddenly I’m getting stuff done.\n\nWhen I procrastinate, it’s never because the task is hard. It’s because my brain gets overwhelmed by all the invisible steps. \n\nWhat surprised me most is how efficient it feels. Tasks that used to take an entire afternoon of avoidance + guilt now get done in like 30 minutes. And I don’t end the day exhausted from decision-making.",

              "text": "This is a great comment and I appreciate you bringing up Professor Smith. You are absolutely right—if the goal is purely overcoming Sleep Inertia (that groggy feeling immediately upon waking), the literature supports immediate caffeine intake. Smith’s work is solid there.\nHowever, the protocol I mentioned (supported by Dr. Matthew Walker and others) is optimizing for a different variable: Preventing the afternoon crash.\nThe mechanism is Adenosine Kinetics. Since caffeine blocks adenosine receptors without actually clearing the chemical, drinking it immediately upon waking \"traps\" the residual sleep pressure from the night before. When the caffeine wears off, that residual adenosine floods the receptors alongside the new adenosine built up during the day, leading to a harder crash in the afternoon.\nIt’s a trade-off. If you need to be alert right now, drink it immediately. If you want to avoid the crash at 2 PM, the delay allows for natural clearance first.\nHere is the research on the adenosine/caffeine interaction mechanism if you want to dig in: https://ai.hubermanlab.com/d/a0955576-4eba-11ee-8dc0-c7cb6ee09013?t=3-Understanding+Sleep+Pressure",

          "text": "It's important to understand that burnout doesn't simply dissipate over time. In fact, the underlying stressors that contribute to burnout, such as demanding workloads, unhealthy habits, and unrealistic expectations, often persist. When you rest, your batteries recharge a bit, but if you plug them back into the exact same system (same pace, same digital distractions, same lack of boundaries), they drain just as fast again.\n\nIt has been suggested that a more effective approach might be to view burnout as a process issue rather than a matter of willpower.\n\nIt might be beneficial to consider a systematic approach to reducing \"invisible\" cognitive load, which could include elements such as constant context switching, open loops, and unfinished tasks.\n\nOne approach that may be worth considering is to design your day around 2–4 truly high-impact blocks of focus. This would be an alternative to trying to be \"on\" all day.\n\nProtecting recovery as a non-negotiable input to performance, rather than a reward when everything is done (because in knowledge work, it's never \"all done\").\n\nOne possible approach to begin the process would be to designate a specific time each day, for the next seven days, for deep work. This could be as little as 25 to 50 minutes, and it would be advisable to decide in advance what you will work on during that time. It may also be beneficial to minimize optional decisions and distractions during this period. In that case, it might be best to consider everything else as \"nice to have.\" It has been observed that when an individual's brain begins to anticipate these focus blocks, the inclination to work continuously (and potentially experience burnout) diminishes.\n\nIf you're interested in putting these ideas into practice, you might consider searching for Focuswift on Google. It's designed to help you create a structured and sustainable focus routine, which can help prevent burnout.",

      "text": "I'm 63, overweight, have not been productive my entire life because of anxiety from ADHD. I wasn't diagnosed for who knows why until I was 58.\n\nNow, for three weeks straight, I'm doing well with Pomodoros and even exercising in between them and eating a lot less.\n\nAnd I'll explain why ... I'll try to not be wordy.  \n(I shared this with my therapist this am, who told me he never thought of it like that and is going to adapt it. His Ph.D. invovled shame and guilt.)\n\n1. Getting Clear about Shame\n\nThat deep down feeling that constantly manifests to \"I'm not good enough.\" is shame.\n\nShame is the disappointment of not being god ... of not being able to control or foresee what thoughts involuntarily show up.\n\nYou chose to go to Subway for lunch. But why? Where did that come from? It's your involuntary mind doing it's automatic dance. You have free will ... to react to thoughts, not to control them.\n\nShame is the disappointment ... and the false, paralyzing reaction is that you are flawed, that you can't ... is **procrastination, the fallout of shame.**\n\nAnd until you understand this, emotionally, first person, and you have an omg! moment, you're not getting out of that circle.\n\nAnd this is why every 'here's how you change' guru says that willpower doesn't work ... because it literally can't, but you want to pretend it can, else you're a quitter.\n\nInstead you need to reinforce habits, start with the morning routine and add one every few weeks.\n\nYour goal has to be to become more Pavlovian ... make choices about putting a structure in place so you don't need to make choices. Pomodoro, GTD (Getting Things Done) is about that.\n\n2. Sleeping Pills\n\nI've never had restful sleep but typically fell asleep quickly. My Dr. suggested sleeping pills ... explaining to me that they are NOT just for falling asleep, they help you KEEP asleep.\n\nFor the first time since was very young I actually sleep eight hours straight. I don't even need to use the bath 2-3x as I did. When I wake it's quick, don't need to get another hour over and over. I actually feel rested.\n\n”trazadone is a prescription antidepressant frequently used \"off-label\" as a potent sleeping pill.”\n\n3) Talking and Standing\n\nYour brain switches gears fast .. the involuntary part that you can't control ... the dwelling.\n\nAnd you can reduce it, increasing focus, by **talking because moving is slower than thinking**.\n\nWhen you mechanize your thinking with talking your thoughts - even the little ones, \"right now I am ... \" , you'll instantly get focused. Simple to try.\n\nStanding is a big deal because when you stand there are more fight or flight responses than when (safely) sitting. Standing is better than sitting. Walking is better than not moving.\n\nI hope this helps. This has easily been the most productive part of my life. If I knew this in school it would've been all A's and not C's.",

Medication gives you the ability to change, but we have to then learn so many things, the things “normal” people learn and get conditioned to at a young age. We’re all extremely lacking the life skills and good habits that get ingrained in most other people during childhood and adolescence. Plus the shame and all the trauma we endured due to our condition is palpable. I still deal with it every day. \n\nThere is a lot of work to be done post diagnosis and it sounds like you’re well on your way.",

      "text": "This is something I noticed about myself over the last couple weeks and it’s been bothering me.\n\nI work from home, and my days kind of blur together. I’ll sit down at my desk around 9, tell myself I’m going to focus, and then somehow it’s 7pm and I’m still “working.” The weird part is, I’m exhausted, but when I look back at the day, I can’t clearly point to what I actually finished.  \nLast week I caught myself in a stupid loop. I was jumping between tabs, Slack, email, docs, back to Slack, then checking something on my phone “for a second,” then back to work. It felt busy, but not productive. One day I literally timed myself and realized I hadn’t stood up from my chair for almost 4 hours. I hadn’t eaten. I hadn’t even refilled my water. I just kept telling myself “I’ll stop after this one more thing.”  \nThe ironic part is I’m not even under crazy financial pressure. I do have some money saved up from myprize, so it’s not like I’m grinding to survive. I think it’s more this anxiety that if I stop, everything will fall behind. So I tried something dumb-simple this week: I set a hard stop time. No matter what. When the alarm hits, I close the laptop. Even if something is unfinished.\n\nThe first day felt wrong. Like I was being irresponsible. But somehow I got more done because I wasn’t dragging everything out all day. I think my problem wasn’t that I wasn’t working enough. It was that I never let my brain turn off, so everything took longer.\n\nDoes anyone else struggle more with stopping than starting? How do you actually enforce boundaries with yourself when you work like this?",

          "text": "I WFH and I'm mostly self-directed so I know how easy it is to fall into that pattern.\n\nOne technique I use is time blocking. I plan out the amount of time to do a task/project and just do it for that amount of time. I use my calendar to block out those times. When the calendar reminder comes up for the next task, I know to wrap up what I'm working on. Which leads me to...\n\nI also put personal care items on my calendar: lunch break (30min), stretch break (10min), walk break (29min), etc. I get water and snack as necessary during stretch breaks. The rule for me during stretch breaks is that I have to do it away from my computer. Lunch break is very important; I also mark myself out of office for that time.\n\nOne other thing I got in the habit of doing, which was incredibly helpful, was to put an appointment near the end of my workday (for me, 5pm) that's titled \"wrap-up workday\". I have a checklist of things to do during that appointment like plan out the next day, check critical messages, make notes on what I'm working on and haven't finished, etc. When that appointment reminder comes up, it helps me make that cognitive break. \n\nI used to (don't so much anymore) schedule 3-4 times a day to check emails. As we know, there's usually more emails than there is time in the day. I just plan to get as many read and replied to as possible during that time (usually 20-30 min). Then I stop. \n\nThe important thing with this method is to always have a \"next\" event on your calendar that reminds you to switch tasks. (Excepting the wrap-up workday one!)\n\nDo I give myself the freedom to keep working on a task if I'm in the flow? Sure - but then it's a conscious decision to bump something else to make way for the extra time. Do I sometimes come back to work in the evening? Sure, but I've also ensured I've taken a dinner break.",

Another thing that helps some people is defining a done list instead of a to do list, so you can actually see what you finished before you shut down.

Not because they're less dedicated, but because they've learned that \"done for today\" is a skill, not a failure.\n\nThe discomfort you felt on day one (\"like I was being irresponsible\") is the tell. That's the anxiety talking, not reality. The fact that you got MORE done with less time proves it.\n\nOne thing that's helped me: I don't just set a stop time, I set a \"shutdown ritual\", even if it's just writing tomorrow's top 3 priorities and physically closing the laptop.

Later, I was able to do away with that practice, but I still have days I don’t feel like going. On those days, I go anyway and tell myself there’s no expectation. I can go, lift for 15 minutes and then go home if I want. The funny thing is that it is often those days where I end up getting in really good workouts. After 15 minutes, the endorphins take over and it feels too good to want to stop.",

          "text": "There is a very interesting book called _The Power of Habit_ which goes into the science of habit and habit formation and how to use that information in rewiring maladaptive habits (ie, stress eating) or forming good habits. I read it around the same time as Atomic Habits and found they complemented each other really well and I highly recommend it. \n\nOne of the things the author discussed was a study on outcomes of patients who had undergone knee or hip replacement at an orthopedic hospital where the patient population leaned older, poorer, less educated, and their joints tended to be in worse shape. These surgeries also require a rigorous (read: painful) rehab schedule that you really have to adhere to in order to have a good outcome or else your new joints will fill with adhesions and not be as effective. They gave these patients booklets to write out their plans for their recovery alongside their rehab schedule. Patients who filled out the booklets had significantly better outcomes than the ones that didn't. They identified three main behaviors they thought drove the habit formation:\n\n1. They had a plan! They wrote down their goals and were specific about them. \"I am going to walk to the bus stop Tuesday afternoon to meet my wife on her way home\".\n\n2. Their plan included contingency plans for when they hit roadblocks. \"I will go to the gym tomorrow. If I don't feel like going to the gym, I will go anyway. If I still don't feel like it when I am there, I will jog for half a mile at a conversational pace and then go home.\" And boom, the habit of going to the gym gets reinforced. \n\n3. They defined rewards for getting over the hump. Bus stop guy got to see his wife, other subjects would position candy throughout the house that they were allowed to eat only if they got their under their own power, etc. You need to reward yourself in order to strengthen habits. \n\nI strongly recommend reading it. It's a good companion to Atomic Habits (and appears a few times in the endnotes IIRC).",

Fair point. 👍🏻\n\nFWIW I’ve successfully applied Atomic Habits by focusing hard on the “build better systems” aspect.  The same way I needed a system to quit smoking, I also needed one (a very different one) to lose weight, and then yet another one to level up professionally.  The novel idea (to me) of focusing on system-building instead of cold-turkeying or sheer-willpowering my way thru the change (as I had so many times before) made the difference between “life hack” and “lifestyle change” for me.",

For many people, it’s an entry point. When life gets messy, slipping into habits isn’t a failure; it’s part of the build. You’re still practicing the system.\n\nIt’s easy to do habits on good days and hard on bad ones, but that’s true of any process. The point is that the good days are training. You build the habit when it’s easy so you’re better equipped when it’s not.\n\nAnd as for whether it just makes you “think about habits”, every habit starts that way. Nothing is automatic at first. Thinking about it is part of the transition from intentional action to something that eventually becomes part of daily life.",

          "text": "What changed my behaviour was actually understanding the mechanics behind habits.\n\nIf your brain is a program, dopamine is the programming language.\n\nDopamine spikes of thrill or pleasure are the ones that program your brain. Dopamine spikes of prediction and anticipation are the ones that run those programs.\n\nYou can even look at it like a video game, where the final level is one in which you feel inbuilt motivation to just jump out of bed and DO the hard things.\n\nFor instance...\n\nThere are 3 levels of **l**earning you need to go through to integrate a new skill or habit or knowledge.\n\nIf you make it to level 3, the Hard Thing becomes automatic, in the sense that the motivation to do it is inbuilt and implicit. (It basically feels worse NOT to do it.)\n\nThe mechanism behind that inbuilt motivation is (funnily enough) a dopamine \"spike.\" But it isn't a spike of satisfaction at completion. It's a spike of prediction. The brain has learned what predicts the hard task and the spike of completion at the end of the task has shifted to a spike of anticipation, or motivation at the start of the task. It's a beautiful system and makes hard things feel easy... when you've levelled up this high.\n\nBut to get to level 3, you have to progress past 1 and 2.\n\nLevel 1 - The hard task feels hard because it is brand new and you have no inbuilt motivation to do it (besides some ephemeral desire to be the kind of person who does said hard task... but the brain can't make predictions based on desire, it needs receipts).\n\nBut if you can push through and stay in Level 1 for even just TEN minutes, you'll move to...\n\nLevel 2 - Your brain hasn't yet been shown enough evidence to shift the spike of motivation upstream for you BUT it can recognise that in the moment, the task is now a Real Thing and will temporarily increase tonic dopamine to support you. This is another form of motivation that makes it feel like you're \"in the zone.\" It will help you keep going and finish the hard task.\n\nThe tricky part is...\n\nNext time you do the hard task, you'll have to start at Level 1 again.\n\nBut if you're repeating the task every day (or at least a few times a week), it should theoretically take less and less time for you to get to Level 2 within a single session. You'll get \"in the zone\" faster and faster.\n\nWith enough repetitions, you'll eventually crack Level 3 and it will feel like you've just figured out the cheat code to life. Your brain will have integrated the hard task as part of who you are. You'll find it hard/uncomfortable not to do the task.\n\nAll the greats who achieve these amazing things aren't blessed with extra willpower – they've programmed it into their brains through repetition. They've created systems and repeated those systems so many times over that they're all operating at Level 3.\n\nDon't give up at Level 1. Level 3 is where things get easy, and life gets GOOD.\n\n(I write about this stuff in more detail on Substack if you want to understand the concept of dopamine engineering a little better. Link is in my profile if curious. Free. No strings attached. Just trying to pay it forward.)",

However, your problem seems to be mindset.\n\nYou are attaching some negative emotions to the task. Maybe you should have responded to the email two weeks ago and you feel guilt? Maybe you scroll a lot through social media and your brain thinks, it is exceptionally boring task. That would be mindset issue.\n\nMaybe, someone asked you to respond, but you think it is pointless? That would be motivation issue.\n\nEach of those requires completely different solutions.",

          "text": "This is exactly right. Most procrastination is about avoiding a feeling, not avoiding work. The task itself is usually easy or at least manageable. What the brain wants to escape is the brief discomfort before starting like uncertainty, fear of doing it badly, or just that awkward tension in the chest.\n\nThat is why motivation magically appears after you begin. Starting proves to your nervous system that the threat was exaggerated, so the emotion drops fast. Waiting just gives the brain more time to invent reasons to stay comfortable.\n\nWhat helps is treating the discomfort as part of the task, not something to eliminate first. You are not trying to feel ready. You are agreeing to feel slightly uncomfortable for 30 to 60 seconds while you begin. Once you expect that feeling instead of fighting it, it loses a lot of power.\n\nA simple trick is to define the start as something laughably small. Not send the email, just open it. Not write the report, just type the title. That lowers the emotional spike enough to get moving, and momentum does the rest.\n\nSo yeah, procrastination is mostly emotion management. Time management only works once the emotions stop running the show.",

You will see, over and over again, how long tasks actually take. (it can be broader like, 4 hours: desk work, it doesn't have to be hyper specific all the time, some time you just gotta sit at work), but if washing the kitchen floor is a task, put those 30 minutes on the calendar. Block your commute, your breakfast.  You will see you only have time for like 3 non-work tasks a day.  That is ok. That is realistic. It's being human. If you over-schedule, that is fine, move your task further down the calendar.  But the concept is once it is 1. Captured and 2. Scheduled, a LOT of the mental load is gone, and  you can focus on following your schedule and doing one task at at time.  \n\nHonestly, i need to get back to this, it really helped me for a few years.

The approach is  executed with the next 3 parts:\n   * 1 - We use concrete steps rather than whole ideas\n   * 2 - We create a list of steps we can realistically execute each day, NOT a massive list of *ideas*; ideas are made of steps & a massive list is not a plan we can commit to realistically accomplishing in the working portion of the day\n   * 3 - We are willing to ask for help (in-person, on the phone, and via video calls) instead of *insisting* on working solo\n\nProductivity is an **energy-based game**.  If we choose to fly solo 24/7 & expose ourselves to huge lists of ideas rather than finite lists of steps, then we risk **blowing a mental circuit** & engaging in avoidance behavior by way of task paralysis.  It's hard to see the reality of this system mentally & emotionally because it's an *invisible process*.\n\nOn top of that, our brain HATES being held accountable!  It does NOT want to ask for help, write steps down, or create a finite list to commit to working on & then put that list in the sequence we want to accomplish the steps in.  Instead, it wants to emotionally bully us into keeping the entire list of ideas in our head & insist on working all by ourselves, knowing that we will blow a mental fuse & then not have to expend the energy & effort of doing any actual work.\n\nThat turns into Groundhog Day, where we we keep looping the same behavior over & over again because the process is **invisible**.  Thus we become subject to an *emotion*\\-based approach, i.e. *try really hard* to accomplish whatever we have the *energy* for.  And so our brain will refuse to ask for help, refuse to make a finite written list of steps in sequence, and refuse to work just because it doesn't \"feel\" like it.\n\nThen we're stuck floundering & shorting out quickly!  Same story every time lol.",

Don't feel guilty about re- schedule tasks. You haven't failed you're just planning your work properly. To avoid your tasks going overdue, set a 'due date' and a 'do date'.

It is a goal tracker with to do lists; it has task duration so I don’t overcrowd my day, has widgets where I see my to do list on my lock screen and can tick them off, see how much time I added for my to-dos, etc. \n\nI think adding approximate time on your to do list might do the trick as well, since your main problem seems to be underestimating the task durations",

Flexible working hours and reasonable deadlines mean I have excellent work-life balance, so I can enjoy life with my family and be there for my little kids when they need me. Work just serves as an intellectual outlet and an income stream. \n\n\nI do think a willingness to work hard and make the most of things is at least as important as passion for success, if not more so.

I realized I’m very logical and analytical and good at numbers/math— I’m also always asking “why”. I pursued data science with a reputable bootcamp (not always suggested but it worked for me). That trickled into data engineering type work, and leading data strategy. I definitely don’t spend my free time writing Python code for fun, but I am sooo much happier and get a lot of fulfillment and am a full on data geek now. But I was definitely that person who was very lost and felt overwhelmed by the potential paths out there.

Yes, at times time off work is intolerable and I end up being restless/distracted/useless, but I don’t find it worse than working your as off some place you don’t wholly value in service to something. Unless you’re both, know what you like and are fortunate to be at place of belonging. But truly, how many people are like that…. At least it’s never worked for me that way.  \nFinancial stability, time off after work, and lack of interest are a lot better than having neither. Or having passions and no money. Was extremely worried on that subject before, seems it all somehow settled down and I have immense appreciation and gratitude for what I have with lack of purpose. And yeah, maybe it will come!",

Keep working.  \n\nWhen it feels like there is absolutely nothing you can do to keep them from leaving, dramatically stop working.

This phone call turned out to be more serious than expected. Use gestures to keep the other person from speaking and leaving.  \n\nWhen you feel like you can't keep this charade going any longer, it's time for an exit. But not for them. The phone call can finally end, but ohmygod, look at the time. You have this very important scheduled meeting. But it will take just a couple of minutes, and you'll be right back. Tell them to wait and make sure you are the first one to leave.  \n\nRepeat enough times and they'll be staying away from you when you are busy.

Too many times I have given my full attention and advice to people for over 30 minutes and then that falls on me for picking my kids up late from daycare due to having to catch up, and it’s just not worth it. With this said, when I do get the chance to say hi or see them on break or whatever, I try to catch up with them (quickly) and make it known I still care. I enjoy my coworkers and DO care about them. I did need to set boundaries though for myself, it was hard but I got there. \n\n“Not being one for small talk” IS okay. It’s okay to not be the most extroverted and advice giver in the office.

A post it will not work, I can misplace that or throw it away. I can’t throw away my entire yearly day-day calendar.  It drives me nuts to have my Tuesday box with left over things.  I also must place it where I can’t avoid it. I will otherwise.  \n\nRecently I’m trying to use an app where I put my things I need to do and I feed a cartoon bird when I check them off.  Must…make…birb…happy.   And I can add in things like “research X project” this day, “decide” on this day, “start” this day….  Etc. basically break it down so I can’t convince myself to stay in research mode forever.  I also feel less dumb putting little things like “brush teeth” into an app as opposed to in writing.

I don't play sports and I don't like it. I can only go out with my friends on weekends because they are very busy, and that makes me feel like a failure. I don't spend much time on social media, but I sleep a lot in the afternoon, then I study and play bass (but I only do it for an hour). I also have a band, but we never rehearse because everyone else is busy. I don't like reading because I haven't discovered a literary genre that I'm passionate about yet. I'd like to learn to cook, but I've failed at a couple of recipes and have given up hope. I like movies, but I can't afford a subscription. I also need money, so I tried putting up flyers to become a dog walker, but no one has called me. Having so much free time makes me think too much, and I feel like I'm wasting my time. I also feel tired and sleepy all the time. Have you ever felt this way? Is it normal? How do you get over it? what could I do?",

What changed things wasn’t a new technique, but how I approached my own effort. I started paying more attention to *why* I was working, not just *how*. When the goal became improving myself instead of just completing tasks, consistency followed more naturally. Learning a skill, improving focus, and showing up a little better each week felt more sustainable than pushing for perfect days. I also realized how much environment matters. Not just physical space, but mental space. The people you talk to, the content you consume, the ideas you surround yourself with all of it shapes how motivated you feel without you noticing. Being around thoughtful conversations and shared growth made effort feel less lonely. Instead of forcing daily routines, I switched to simple check with myself. What gave me energy? What drained it? What’s one small thing worth doing tomorrow? That clarity reduced procrastination more than any productivity hack I tried.Motivation didn’t come from pressure anymore. It came from direction. Productivity feels different when it’s tied to growth, connection, and purpose not just output.

I recently went down a rabbit hole looking into multitasking \"switching costs,\" and the data seems pretty brutal. Based on this \"micro-switches\" between tabs or apps can cannibalize up to 40% of your productive time. (based on recent american psychologists study)\n\nBasically your brain toggles between processes. This \"switching\" triggers two distinct stages in your executive control: goal shifting (deciding to change tasks) and rule activation (re-configuring the brain's \"rules\" for the new task). Every time you check a notification, your brain has to \"uninstall\" the rules for your essay and \"install\" the rules for social media. This mental friction creates a massive \"lag\" that drains your working memory, leaving you mentally exhausted before you’ve even finished your first paragraph.\n\nIn short: You’re effectively wasting 40% of you brain capacity to set up your brain for a different task.",

I'd recommend looking into an Al slide builder like Gamma or Beautiful.ai. We use Gamma. Heads up, though: a weird thing I discovered when we made the switch is that if your team has a lot of experience with PPT and building decks manually, there's a bit of an unlearning process. One of my\ndirect reports had a really hard time because they were so used to working in PowerPoint, they couldn't wrap their brain around working with a flexible doc instead of fixed slides. That said, it's absolutely worth looking into because it saves so so much time.",

If you are not really good at creating presentations or don't want to create them at all, use Ai. Pay them a little and you are good to go. \n\n2. If you want to have your own style, use canva and create one presentation very well and set a tone. Now use that as a template for your other presentations. For the next ones, just change the colors and style a little. \n\nI once had to give 4 presentations consecutively in 4 days for my entire team (uni project). And this was the strategy I used.

I also stopped making huge to do lists. I pick one main thing per day and that’s it. Anything else is a bonus.\n\nStill distracted sometimes. Especially when I’m tired.

I started watching movies again and honestly, I’m turning into a cinephile. Planning to watch a new movie every weekend like my own tradition for myself. It’s been fun searching for a movie i like - watching and then reflecting on it. Regarding books,I am currently reading 1984 - done till part 2/3. I am planning to read classics in 2026. I wish to know more about the past so will take up history non fiction next. I went to an art exhibition and i realised i like spending time watching and learning from art. \n\nI have been, however, struggling with maintaining a balance between these new hobbies and my work/studies. Its good to know barely a month has passed because i wish to try more new things out. I do wish to go out on weekend, specially spend my Sunday out of bed-perhaps visiting art exhibitions? However, not planned anything concrete yet. My next task is to recognise/get a routine so i could perhaps continue with my hobbies while not feeling guilty of being “non productive”.  Later on in the year, i might start with my goals regarding my health and my social network but that will take a lot of motivation/courage tbh.",
