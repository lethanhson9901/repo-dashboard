It’s exhausting but somehow feels impossible to stop. You don’t even realize how much it messes with your focus, mood, relationships, everything.\n\nI’ve tried setting limits. I’ve tried uninstalling apps. I’ll stay off for a few days, maybe a week if I’m lucky, and then suddenly I’m back to scrolling like nothing changed. No decision, just autopilot.\n\nThe worst part is people don’t take it seriously. If you say your screen time is out of control or that you’re stuck on your phone, people laugh it off or say “same.” But this actually feels like a real problem, just quieter and completely normalized.\n\nAnyone else feel this way?\n\nDo you even try to control it, or have you just accepted it at this point?\n\nWould genuinely like to hear how other people deal with this, or if anyone else feels equally stuck.",

In the morning, I go for a long walk without my phone, just got into the hang of enjoying the nature's real beauty. Evening, I play a sport for a while and do some workout. \n\nAnd after getting back home, I literally spend time with my family. Sometimes, we don't know what to speak to a life partner after years of marriage. But, I met a couple who will take their cup of coffee and sit outside their balcony for some time every day and just talk about random things and build conversations with that. For example, just saying 'that house has a beautiful structure'. From there the conversations begin and go for sometime. And yes, it is interesting. \n\nNow, it has started feeling like a lot of no screen time is coming my way!",

You know the cycle: download a complex new tool, spend 3 days setting it up, and then abandon it a week later.\n\nThis year, I purged everything that added friction. These are the ones that survived because they actually simplify my life rather than complicating it.\n\n1. **Willow Voice:** I talk faster than I type. This works in any text field to draft emails or Slack messages, cleaning up the \"\"umms\"\" automatically.\n2. **Todoist:** I tried Notion for tasks, but it was too much clicking. Todoist’s natural language input (\"\"Buy milk tomorrow at 5pm\"\") is unbeatable.\n3. **Forest:** If I touch my phone, my tree dies. It sounds silly, but the gamification actually stops me from doom-scrolling.\n4. **Readwise:** It syncs all my Kindle highlights to one place. Essential for actually remembering what I read.\n5. **Cold Turkey:** When I really need to focus, this is the only blocker I can’t easily bypass.\n6. **Loom:** I stopped typing out 5-paragraph explanations to colleagues. I just record a 30-second video.\n7. **TextExpander:** I have snippets for my email address, Zoom link, and common replies. Saves me thousands of keystrokes a week.\n\nWhat’s the one tool you *actually* use every single day?\"",

My mind would be racing with guilt about my freelance work or the Excel skills I needed to learn, but I felt physically hijacked by old patterns.\n​I finally realized that the more I messed with my mind (criticizing myself, feeling guilty), the more I got stuck. As Sadhguru says, \"The mind is a survival tool, not a liberation tool.\" My mind was just doing its job staying in the \"safe\" loop of the bed.\n\n​I stopped fighting the effect (my thoughts) and started working on the cause: my nervous system. Here is the 2-minute \"Somatic Loop\" I use to actually get to my desk:\n\n​The Toe-to-Head Tension: While still under the covers, I tense my toes for 5 seconds, then release. I work my way up through my calves, thighs, stomach, and face. It manually signals to the body that the \"sleep loop\" is over. It’s like a jump-start for your energy (Prana).\n\n​Sensory Closure: Once I stand up, I immediately splash cold water on my face, feet, and arms. This sensory input tells my brain the \"Lazy Phase\" is officially finished.\n\n​The \"Unfolding\" Goal: I don't think about my freelance projects yet. I just tell myself to unfold my yoga mat. Once that mat is open, my body recognizes the \"Active Loop.\" Taking that one tiny physical initiative makes the rest of the day follow naturally.\n\n​Life is a phenomenon, not a thing to be fixed. Stop criticizing yourself for being \"unproductive.\" You aren't lazy; you’re just stuck in a survival loop. Take responsibility for your physical energy first, and the focus will follow.",

Once you’re moving, the thoughts calm down instead of spiralling. It’s annoying how simple it is, but also kind of relieving that it doesn’t require fixing your entire mindset before breakfast.\n\nThe part about not judging yourself as lazy really hit. That label just makes the loop worse. Treating it as a nervous system thing instead of a character flaw feels way more practical.

It’s already helping a lot because I can visually see where my time and energy are actually going.\n\nI got the idea from a Charlie Morgan productivity video on YouTube who credits Steve Ovens for it. Not sure which exact video it was exactly, but the system stuck.\n\nHow it works\n\n\\-One main dashboard sheet The full year is broken down into months and grouped into Q1 Q2 and so on. Next to it there’s a key with two columns. one for color and one for the main task or category that color represents. You fill each day on the yearly calendar with colors based on what you worked on. This makes it easy to see what you spent most of the year doing and whether it was actually worth it.\n\n\\-Monthly sheets There are 12 separate sheets, one for each month. Each day has around 5 empty rows where you write that day’s to do list. Tasks can be moved around easily and color coded.\n\n\\-Simple feedback system If a task that absolutely needed to be done that day wasn’t completed, you mark it red. If you complete a task, you mark it green. By the end of the month you can clearly see how much red vs green there is and assess whether you actually did what you said you would or just stayed busy.",

      "text": "This happened during a pretty average workday. I had a full to-do list, nothing overwhelming, nothing exciting. Around mid-afternoon I noticed I was bouncing between tasks, checking things off, but not really finishing anything cleanly.\n\nNormally I’d respond by tightening up. Pomodoro timer, stricter list, less “wasted” time. Instead, I did the opposite. I left my desk, made coffee, and sat there for five minutes doing absolutely nothing. No phone, no planning, no optimizing.\n\nWhen I came back, I finished the next task faster than I expected. And the one after that. It wasn’t because I found some secret trick, it was because my brain had stopped resisting. I realized how much of my productivity problem comes from constantly trying to force output instead of letting focus reset naturally.\n\nI still plan my day and I still care about getting things done. I even keep money set aside from myprize so I don’t feel pressure to grind every minute just to feel secure. But I’ve started leaving intentional gaps instead of packing everything tight, and weirdly, more gets finished.\n\nI think I confused being busy with being effective for a long time. Turns out sometimes the most productive thing you can do is stop trying to be productive for a moment. Curious if anyone else noticed something similar once they loosened their grip a bit.",

And I learnt this from a Youtuber called HealthyGamer. \n\n**Step 1: Every morning, I start by listing out my tasks.** \n\nTasks should contain, Description so I understand what I have to do, the Outcomes of the task, and Deadline. \n\nI make sure I have at least 3-5 tasks per day. The task needs to be specific.  \nExample:   \nStudy for SAT exam **- Is not specific enough**  \nStudy Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - **is Specific enough for me.** \n\n**Step 2: Know the Outcomes.** \n\nThe outcomes need to be specific too!\n\nTask: Study Fundamental Theorem of Calculus  \nOutcomes: 1. Understand how differentiation and integration are connected  \n2. Understand how to solve area and accumulation problems easily.  \n\n\nClear outcomes define the success criteria of your task.\n\n**Step 3: Perform task for 2 mins**\n\nI clearly know that learning FTC will take me a few hours. But I do it for 2 mins. I don't stop at 2 mins, but i tell myself, all you need to do is perform this task for 2 mins. I convince myself that i can do this in 2 mins and start. But I always forget that i had a 2 minute timer and work on it without having to stop. If i do hit a wall, I tell myself, I will try for 2 mins, If it work it works, but always end up finishing the task. \n\n**Step 4: Finish the 3-5 tasks every single day.**\n\nMost tasks which we think will take hours can be completed in under 2 mins. Think about it, for you to have a productive day all you need to do is finish 5 tasks which generally task 2 mins. 10 mins of effort is all you need to keep moving forward! You can still keep scrolling for hours, but you just need to finish 5 tasks, gain the 5 outcomes before you do it. \n\n  \nThis is what I try to do every day. And it has helped me immensely. Heck, the reason I am typing about this is because i had it as a task. It took me 10 mins to type this, but I told myself it'll only take 2.",

PDFs I swore I'd read \"*later*.\" Voice memos with ideas that are probably just me mumbling.\n\nLast week I spent 20 minutes trying to find an article I KNEW I'd saved about habit formation. Couldn't find it. Gave up. Googled it. Found a different article.\n\nSaved that one too.\n\nThat's when it hit me. I'm not building a \"personal knowledge base.\" I'm hoarding. The act of saving something gives me a little dopamine hit like I accomplished something. But I never actually DO anything with it.\n\nSaving feels like learning without the actual work of learning.\n\nI tried forcing myself to write one sentence about WHY I'm saving something before I hit the button. It helped. I save way less now. But I still have this massive graveyard of \"I'll get to it eventually\" content sitting there.\n\nI'm curious, who else have this problem of endlessly collecting but never using what they save? Has anything actually worked for you? I tried looked for apps/software to help but couldn't find any :( \n\nAny advice?",

What’s helped me is forcing myself to spend like 5 minutes trying to solve it first before typing anything: grabbing paper, old-school Googling, or just sitting with the discomfort for a bit. Most of the time my brain eventually kicks in.\nIt’s not about quitting cold turkey, just about letting your brain do the work instead of outsourcing every thought. And honestly, being aware of it already puts you ahead that’s half the battle.",

Whenever you have a thought or any topic to talk about with ChatGPT, just write that down instantly somewhere in a note app. Don't instantly open ChatGPT itself, and make a time window for when you'll open it, like when you have your main work done so it doesn't distract you. So at that time, you'll just ask exactly what you noted. \n\nNo judgment, but to really reduce this addiction, try walking more. Yes, I know, not joking. Try sitting with your own thoughts in silence. Walk and understand yourself, observe your thoughts, make time for this to do daily. Over time, you'll see yourself approaching ChatGPT less, and you'll be much more calm and grounded. Thanks for sharing it, friend. I've been through this as well, but it got reduced over time as I started opening it less and using the techniques I just shared. So try them, it might work out. Peace.",

      "text": "TL;DR- meditation helped me realise what living in the moment means.\n\nI was really fed up with my procrastination and overthinking problems. Whenever I tried to study or sit down to do my work, I would just start procrastinating. I would end up watching reels or thinking about random stuff. Other times, while just sitting there, I would go completely blank and get consumed in my thoughts.\n\nThese problems were making it really difficult for me to do anything. I was constantly stuck in a position where I wanted to work hard and focus on my studies, but because of all this overthinking about the future, what will happen, whether I will get a job or not, it kept hampering my studies.\n\nThis kept going on until I realized something. Around that time, I started meditating to improve my focus and to get some distance from my thoughts. And honestly, it turned out to be a wonderful decision.\n\nIt’s been six months now, and one of the most beautiful realizations that helped me overcome my overthinking and procrastination was this. All we really have is this moment. There is no past or future in the way we imagine it. What we call the future is something we only ever experience as the present. We never actually experience the future as future. All thoughts about it stay in our head. Experientially, we can only live in the present.\n\nThis realization might sound simple. I had heard it so many times before, live in the moment, focus on the present, but I could never really digest it. I just wasn’t able to grasp it. I’ve also heard this from Sadhguru, that “In reality, there is only now. If you know how to handle this moment, you know how to handle eternity.” But earlier, it stayed as just a quote for me.\n\nMeditation did something different. It was like it planted this understanding inside me. After meditating, this was no longer just a thought. It became real for me. It became a realization.\nAnd naturally, I was able to focus on what was in front of me. I stopped constantly thinking about what would happen in the future. I just knew that all I can do is work now. That’s what is in my hands. What I cannot do, I anyway won’t be able to do. But what I can do, I don’t want to miss it. So I'll do whatever I can.\n\nThis helped me a lot. Just felt like sharing this.\n\nThank you for reading.",

Is that necessary for you , do you have time , are you ready to spend you time on it ? And be satisfied from it , at some time I started to think like this and now I feel wow! I have changed",

It's a lot easier to slowly build up habits over years than to try to make a bunch of huge changes at once.\n* Go easy on myself. If I feel like I screwed up (by doing too much organizing and burning out, by not getting enough done etc.) I just don't let it bother me. It has never helped me to beat myself up over anything.\n* Set time limits. If you want to completely overhaul something and it will take many hours, just spend 15 minutes on it every day or two instead of using your entire day to knock it out. Really this is about prioritizing. If your work is the most important part of your day, don't spend your entire day organizing things. Spend a bit of it organizing things and the rest working.\n* Pay attention to my energy levels and learn to rest. I also have ADHD so it is important to manage my stimulant dosage on top of my focus and my sleep. And I have found there is little reason to try to force myself to get things done when I am burned out. It's better to rest to get more done later.\n* Meditation has been the most important habit for me. It helps you to see exactly how your mind works, which lets you deal with these types of things with more wisdom.\n\nHope some of that helps!",

It's made me realize that tackling the big task will make my day 10x easier instead of me dreading doing the task, not doing the task, and then getting even more stressed out about the task. I only figured this out by realizing that my habit and mood tracker would reveal when I didn't do this exercise. Basically, focus on completing the one task that'll make your day 10x easier and then go from there.",

There’s no real pressure to wake up early, so bedtime procrastination naturally kicks in.\n\nBut what if there was motivation? What if there was a real consequence?\n\nNot directly promoting, just sharing what’s been relevant for me: I run a community focused on making early rising and high performance sustainably easy. We host a 4-week 5 a.m. consistency bootcamp where we connect for just 15 minutes at 5 a.m. every day. We also bring in subject-matter experts who talk about different self-improvement topics.\n\nHere’s the catch—and this is what actually works:\n\nOnce you register, if you don’t show up at 5 a.m. the next day, you pay a penalty. That money goes straight into the prize pool.\n\nSo the system is simple: structure + support + real consequences.\n\nI agree, 5 a.m. isn’t for everyone. But if you genuinely want to push yourself and become your best version, this kind of setup can work surprisingly well.",

Capturing the idea\n2. Making the priorities\n3. Creating the weekly plans\n4. Creating the quarterly plans\n5. Measuring your performance\n6. Learning from mistakes\n7.

          "text": "I use a couple different methods. One method is my journal. It’s really an everything journal, which started out as a bullet journal, and then I just write everything in it, but because I put it in a binder and my binder fills up, I am forced to remove the pages and put them on a shelf finder. So I decided that I would do that once a month, and when I do that, I review all the pages. So when I brain dump my ideas and thoughts into my journal, no matter how scattered they are, when I go through my monthly review, I will catch them and check them, and if it is a thought that I want to carry over, I will write it down on my review page.\n\nMy other way of organizing my thoughts is using ChatGPT. I utilize this most often at the end of the day, before bed. I will dictate into a chat, whatever is on my mind, kind of like journaling, and I just dump all my thoughts, including ideas. And then when I read back the response, it generates new thoughts and ideas in my head, it’s almost like a brainstorming session with myself. I then keep those thoughts into different chats, which I organize in projects in ChatGPT. And then I might name the chat something to keep track of it. Sometimes I will tell the chat to remind me later about it and it will a week later. Send me an email about the idea if it is something I want to do later.\n\nOther ways include the Notes app in my phone. Sometimes I just think of an idea, and then I open up the Notes app in my phone and dictate into it. It’s similar to ChatGPT, but there’s no feedback. I use that less now than I used to, because I find getting the feedback from ChatGPT to be more beneficial. What’s nice about the Notes app though is you can organize it into folders and you can use hashtags and other ways to track and organize the ideas and thoughts.\n\nA final idea I’ve never used but have been wanting to try is Zettelkasten. it involves 3 x 5 cards that you can organize in different boxes or drawers. It is an established method and it seems to really work.",

What I love about Trello is that I can put checklists into the cards. So everything I know about the project/idea goes into the card on a checklist/todo-list. \n\nThis way, nothing gets lost, but I can keep focus on the 3 things/projects i consider most important. I always have access to „other“ to keep adding thoughts when they come. \n\nIt is easy to promote an idea to its own „line“ e.i. important project. \n\nAnd I have Trello on the phone and on the pc, so that I can really always reach it. \n\nI use the free version.

I used to eat healthy and wake up early and eat good,read books, now i dont do anything of this\n\nNow i already know the path i should take, i know that distractions are the enemy, and the solution is not to stop it entirely but take them in moderation, but just to make the process quick and benefit more quickly from it, i am thinking of, going hard core this week, like no junk food at all, wake upat 6 or 7 am, no phone until 2pm unless i have an arrangement or somthing special that needs the phone, and push myself to any thing that is beneficial bht also uncomfortable life cold showers or gym at not preferable times if i didnt get to go to gym in a good time, just to build some discipline more, i also think of doing a list of things i want to do and then ordering them and giving them their timeline in the day to do them, i used to do this before but not anymore, what other things you guys suggest to add?\n\nAlso, how long would it take to get back to a semi normal state?

          "text": "I just did a deep dive on the question \"how long does it take to form a habit\". To keep it simple, with **consistent effort**, it takes on average **66 days** to form a habit. However this can be dramatically different depending on the difficulty of the habit you're trying to form.\n\nYou have exactly the right question, which is putting the emphasis on re-wiring the brain. Habits are **neurological**, so you have to train your nervous system. It's the same system you would need to learn a new language or an instrument. It takes time, practice, and dedication to see results.\n\nSomething like drinking 2 liters of water a day may only take 2-3 weeks to make a habit. Going to the gym 3 times a week may take 2-3 months. Studying two hours a day, everyday, may take 4-6 months.\n\nIn the early stages, when you're building the habit, you'll feel it. It takes effort, even if it doesn't feel like much, and it may be very uncomfortable. It's part of the process, but remember that you have to **remember to show up**. When it's in your nervous system (i.e. your brain is rewired), it becomes **nearly automatic**. It's no longer difficult. It's not even easy. It just becomes part of your routine. You'll know you got to this point because you'll feel uncomfortable **not** going to the gym or studying.\n\nThe most important part of this process is **staying motivated**. Start small and rack up little wins daily. For example, if you're starting a gym program, start with short programs with lighter weight. This will not only get you moving, it will mitigate injury in the process. 20-30 minutes just being in the gym, pumping 5 pound weights will give you the confidence to say to yourself, \"**I can do this**.\" Build from there. Don't be afraid to **half ass it**. If you can't do the whole, do a quarter, even a tenth. The name of the game is **keep showing up**. Don't beat yourself up or punish yourself for needing a break or not doing the whole program. You can rest, but **don't quit**. It will help if you document your progress and keep [SMART goals](https://www.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/IC-SMART-Goals-Worksheet-9237-PDF.pdf).\n\nTrust and believe in the process and yourself, go easy on yourself, stay determined, and you'll outpace 99% of those around you. Best of luck, fellow internet stranger. I really hope you find your stride.",

Hopefully I'll be putting more hours in to make more money.\n\nMy health has improved, etc. Oh I'm also seeing my small friend circle this Sunday for the Superbowl. All you gotta do is network and save a bit of cash. By living at home you're giving yourself space to catch up. 🩷",

Don’t think about how you may appear to others, or what the “typical” path to success looks like, because the only way to get there is by doing inner work that no one else will see. \n\nI used to hate that advice, but I promise you that it is the only way to achieve your goals and stop transposing your own potential into someone else. Every time you think about checking her profile, or reading about someone you’ll inevitably compare yourself to, do something that will benefit YOU. Seriously. \n\nWhenever you feel that urge to check her profile, force yourself to use the time to learn something new about your field, find an event or party or even just a new place to go to (since you’ve mentioned wanting to be more social), etc. Envision the best version of yourself every single day, and figure out how you can work towards being that person with daily tasks, because right now it feels like an ideal instead of a plan with actionable steps. That’s why you get overwhelmed.\n\nYou can do anything you put your mind to. I really believe in you. ",

But don't think you have to find some special purpose in life, don't listen to the rules that society tells you to follow. Your purpose is to do what makes you happy!! Maybe that's video games, maybe it's exploring the outdoors, maybe it's volunteering, or doing art.\n\nTry new things, get out of your comfort zone and I guarantee you will feel alive, you'll learn, you'll meet people, you'll find passions, you'll gain confidence, and you'll not rely on others for happiness or put people on social media on a pedestal.
