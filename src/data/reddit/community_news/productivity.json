      "text": "I bought this glass cookie jar from Target for like $8 and now every time I finish something I write it on a small piece of paper and drop it in the jar.\n\nDoesn't matter if its a big thing or small, if I completed it it goes in. Replied to that annoying email? In the jar. Finally scheduled that dentist appointment I been putting off for 3 months? Jar. Finished a work project? You get it.\n\nThe thing is I realized my problem wasnt that I wasnt being productive, its that I have terrible memory for what I actually accomplished. My brain would just fixate on the 50 things I didnt do yet and completely ignore what I did finish. Now when im feeling like I got nothing done I can literally see this jar filling up over time and it actually helps me chill out.\n\nAlso theres something satisfying about the physical act of dropping the paper in there that hitting a checkbox on my phone never gave me. I had like $250 aside from Stаke that I wanted to invest into productivity stuff and was looking at like fancy planners and app subscriptions but this $8 jar ended up working way better than anything else I tried.\n\nWhen the jar gets full (happened once so far after like 2 months) I dump it out and read through everything which feels pretty good ngl\n\nAnyways just wanted to share cause most productivity stuff focuses on planning what to do but this helped me acknowledge what I already did which turned out to be what I actually needed",

The moment I’m alone at home with no one observing? Total paralysis.\n\nIt’s not about distractions. I can sit in silence for hours and still do nothing. But put me somewhere public or on a call where someone can see me working and suddenly my brain turns on. Tasks feel doable. Time moves.\n\nThat’s when it hit me my productivity isn’t internally driven. It’s performative. I’m motivated by being seen as productive not by the work itself. Without external accountability, my brain just stops initiating.\n\nWhat frustrates me is that most productivity advice assumes motivation comes from inside. Discipline, goals, passion, willpower. But for me none of that works without some form of social presence even passive.\n\nHow do people actually motivate themselves from an internal source? Is this something you can build or do some brains just need external structure to function?\n\nI’m trying to figure out whether this is a flaw I need to fix or just a reality I need to design my life around.\n\nHad a work from home day yesterday with zero meetings.

I've separated an \"office time\" for myself and I get ready like I'm going to the office (dressing up well, taking lunch and coffee with me) and my brain feels like this is my workplace.\n\n  \nThen I used google sheets to track the time of my entire \"office hours\". It has the below table where I fill up everything manually.\n\n|**Start**|**End**|**Duration**|**Category**|**Notes**|**Remarks**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n\n\nI was researching for time tracking app but this raw method felt more \"authentic\" for some reason. I don't constraint myself to the start and end in the sense that I allow +- 5 minutes of flexibility and update the time accordingly. Calculating Duration in my mind instead of using formula is also a great thing for some reason. I want to stick to my routine somehow.\n\n  \nDownside is that after \"office hours\", I don't wanna do anything remotely related to work.\n\n  \nHope it helps someone!",

That's only some people, though- others only get a small benefit, or no benefit, and there's a correlation between ADHD and autism, so a chunk of the no-benefit people might just be autistic- and autism doesn't benefit from ADHD meds on its own, because instead of having the wrong levels of a neurotransmitter, they have the wrong amounts of certain receptors altogether (among other complex things).",

If that was your intention and you're heading towards that by scrolling then it's productive.\n\nReading is not productive without the intention behind it. It is just a more acceptable form of taking your time to than doom scrolling. If you're reading a book or Kindle because you've nothing to do towards your goals then it's not intentional and unproductive. In that you're not working towards something specific.\n\nIf you read with intention then it's productive. By that I mean you're reading to further your knowledge on  trichotomy then reading a book on it is productive and intentional.\n\nIf you're reading a fantasy novel that's number 35 in a series that you like without purpose then you are not intentional or productive. Reading to complete a book series could be seen as productive but it's something you often drift into without intention to do so.\n\nJust because you've done so many so far matters very little IMHO because you kind of reading doom scrolled to get to that \"nearly finished\" status.\n\nThat is why I see people saying they read with virtue but look on closely they are often binge reading a series. Isn't that not a bit like doomscrolling?\n\nOf course your opinion matters more. What you think that is. If you choose to scroll because you have spare time and don't or can't read, do hobbies, even more exercise, etc then do it without stressing about your choice. There's no certainty that reading, crafting or other hobbies are more productive or positive anyway.\n\nPS I'm waiting to drive two hours home from relatives. Everything is packed. Everything is close to being ready to go. I am certainly ready with only shoes to put on, battery pack to pick up and phone to him up to the car to go. I have time without any intentional / productive activity. So I'm reading Reddit. Who knows I might learn something?!!! I feel no negativity over doing this.

(The job is the remodeling of three floors of an old shopping center that is attached to an office hi-rise--e.g., the new Team-Based Classroom used to be Lord & Taylor and the new human-dissection lab used to be the food court.  The company for which I work is in the $5-10 million per year range but their production planning happens mostly in the project managers' heads.  I work directly for the owner--technically he's my project manager, but he's always busy running the company so I'm basically on my own.)\n\nNot to be rude, but it sounds like you aren't involved/have goals with something larger than yourself.  Advice I heard long ago was to get involved with something larger than yourself.\n\nFor instance, decide to learn a foreign language well enough to go visit there in a year or two.  Duolingo or Babel come to mind.  There's a foreign-language video site called LiñgöPie.  Scroll/watch that in the language you're learning and suddenly all your scrolling is productive. (I try to do this but am lazy and end up back at Netflix in my native language. But, new year, new habits.)\n\nAnother thing that I want to replace scroll-time with is learning a CAD program--FreeCAD, specifically. Teaching videos are on a YouTube channel called \"MangoJelly\". The software is free.  There's a lot to learn.  Or get involved with a charity: for instance, a group that tutors disadvantaged school-kids.  \n\nThese are all projects larger than yourself.  Obvs these are ideas out of my life, not yours.  Probably nothing here that interests you.  You need to find your own path.  You'll be fine. New year, new habits. \n\n:)",

We treat habits like chores on a to-do list, so our brains eventually rebel because chores are boring.\n\nThis year, I’m treating each month like a **'Seasonal Arc'** in a movie script.\n\nInstead of just saying 'I’ll gym every day in January,' I’m framing the month as the 'Physical Transformation' scene of my year. I’ve started writing my weekly reviews in the **past tense**—like a monologue of things I’ve already achieved.\n\nIt sounds subtle, but it shifts your identity from 'someone trying to build a habit' to 'the main character who already has that habit.' When the habit is part of your story, you don't need as much willpower to keep it.\n\nI'm dividing my year into 4 Acts (3 months each). One habit per month is great, but try giving each month a 'title' or a 'theme' first. It makes the grind feel a lot more legendary",

I scrambled around with different jobs but it was all very unstable. About ten years later I had an idea that I thought would benefit gas stations, took it to Shell, and they liked it (they were, I think, benevolent to a young man trying his best). Things went fairly well. I bought some equipment and stuff on a loan (again I think I got points for being ballsy and with Shell on the contracts they went along). Then there was this big gas crisis thing, the contracts were cancelled. I paid the loans off, late, with money I scrounged up and the banker was pissed (I think he was put in a difficult situation by me). That was it, I was homeless. I wanted to withdraw from the world, found a very cool house which had been uninhabited for some time ( I was living in a house converted to a hay storage shed on the property beside it)- the lady was very sweet to me and wanted me to fix the place up. It was on 20 acres and about as remote as you could get. I took a job as a laborer on a construction site and started a garden and stuff. A few months later, I went and picked up my younger brother to show him the house but when we pulled up that evening, the house was gone, it had burned down while I was gone. The next day the engine blew in my van. I lost everything including an incredible coin collection I had built from the age of 8. All my clothes. Everything.\nIt was hard to bounce back after that. At about the age of 31 or so I decided I had to get into computers. I had never used a computer before so it was a tall undertaking. I interviewed with someone and called him every day for a month to see if they had made a decision. On the 30th day, I called him and upon being told they were still undecided, I told him I would show at 8:00 the next morning big and if he told me to go home, that’s what I would and not bother him any further. He told me to wear a suit and be prepared to work. I was employed to sell computer supplies and I learned all I could. Eventually, I worked elsewhere and saw a product I really like. I was the only salesperson that seemed fired up about and was selling it. The company offered to set me up as a distributor (age 36). I have sold millions of dollars of that and related products. I have done very well, but I haven’t forgotten what it is like to go hungry or live with rats in a shed. I have compassion for people having a tough time.",

Reading or drawing during these times just isn’t an option because I just cannot focus most of the time and my mind wanders and thinks about too many anxious or depressing thoughts. (I do have adhd). Also there’s people typically around and I can’t read a book while interacting with people if they need something.\n\nI genuinely just hate social media and the algorithm. I want to read interesting articles or play mind games or something that feels more meaningful and engaging but with purpose.

If you're interested in this, I can recommend some apps to teach you for each, but in general, if you haven't decided a path, codecademy, freecodecamp.org, and CS50 (Harvard? Course) have their own apps and/or YouTube channels\n\nDraw/do art (r/art, r/artreference, r/drawing, r/painting, r/digitalart, r/learntodraw, r/drawabox): this mainly consists of using YouTube tutorials, drawing apps, and reference image apps/websites. If interested, I can recommend **A LOT** of resources, in this post, it'd be a lot of bloat.\n\nLearn instrument/sing: my knowledge of apps and resources for this is significantly outdated, but I DO know that I USED TO be learning how to sing and play guitar with some decent apps for the time. It is definitely possible.\n\nWill continue in another comment",

Recommendation. \n\nIf you’re looking for help with budgeting and setting financial goals, there’s an app and a book that have genuinely made a huge difference for me over the last three and a half years and I recommended it always to friends and family.\n\nThe app is YNAB (You Need a Budget), and the book is You Need a Budget.\n\nI never had a debt problem, although many people who do swear by it. What I can say with confidence is that over this period I’ve built a meaningful net worth, largely because it forced me to change my relationship with money how I spend, how I save, and how deliberate I am with decisions. Most importantly, it gave me clear visibility over where every pound is going.\n\nIt’s not any different with knowing what food and how much you should eat\n\nIt’s not magic and it needs some work, but it’s practical, structured, and effective if you’re willing to engage with it properly.",

It’s thought-provoking and packed with insights, has beautiful infographics created by the author, and it encourages a new perspective that is counter to some of the more popular or traditional narratives of happiness. Moreover, the book is deeply grounded in research, and it provides simple applications in the real world.\n\nJoyful “explores how the seemingly mundane spaces and objects we interact with every day have surprising and powerful effects on our mood. Drawing on insights from neuroscience and psychology, she explains why one setting makes us feel anxious or competitive, while another fosters acceptance and delight—and, most importantly, she reveals how we can harness the power of our surroundings to live fuller, healthier, and truly joyful lives.”\n\nIt helps you look at your surroundings with more of an eye toward finding joy. A nudge to “notice” and make small changes that can produce positive outcomes in our environment. Where a lot of books and teachings point us inward, this one reminds us that the outside world does have influence on us, and what we can change there can make a difference.\n\nEnjoy! 📚",

Along the way, it teaches countless lessons about purpose, faith, and listening to your heart. The ending gave me goosebumps and genuinely changed how I see my own life. It’s my favorite book.\n\nThe Courage to Be Disliked is very different in its structure. It follows a dialogue between a young man and a philosopher and explores psychological and philosophical ideas, mainly based on Adlerian psychology. The book teaches that letting go of the desire to be liked or accepted is essential because you are not responsible for others’ expectations or feelings. You give meaning to your own life, and you are in control of your circumstances based on the meaning you assign to them. For example, the book argues that childhood trauma is not the direct cause of social anxiety or low self-esteem; rather, people may use it as a reason to avoid change. In other words, if you truly wanted to change, you would and choosing not to change is still a choice.\n\nI highly recommend both!",

But it hit me hard.\n\nI went home and started thinking about all the things I say I'm going to do. Learn guitar, start that business, travel more, reach out to old friends, get in shape. I've been saying the same things for like five years.\n\nAnd I realized \"I'm going to\" is just a comfortable lie I tell myself and others. Makes me feel like I'm moving toward something without having to actually move. I get to keep the identity of someone with plans and ambitions without the discomfort of attempting them.\n\nIt's safer that way. Because if you never actually try, you never have to face whether you're capable or not. The dream stays perfect in your head.\n\nI don't have a solution to this or anything. I'm still figuring it out. But now when I catch myself saying \"I'm going to\" I stop and ask if I actually am or if I'm just performing intention.\nMost of the time it's performing.\n\nAnd maybe that's okay for some things. Not everything needs to be acted on. But I think I owe it to myself to be honest about what I'm actually doing versus what I'm just saying to feel better.\n\nWords are cheap.

I've been trying to quit nicotine for 3 months, I spiraled and lost control of a lot of things. this morning was one of the first mornings in a long time where I was up before I absolutely had to be.\n\n Unlike my old productive self who would follow some routine, I screwed off my time(I can't even remember what I did with my time really). I'm not mad about it at all. I was really just happy to be getting up sooner. This made me realize that maybe I'm not the person who gets out of bed and goes straight into go mode. Maybe just making my bed and then chilling for 30 minutes is better for me. Does anyone else just take time to chill and wake up in the morning before starting their day? It's an interesting thought that maybe doing what I thought was right in the past was really not the best thing for me as an individual. ",

GTD, time blocking, Notion setups that looked great for about a week, and then quietly fell apart.\n\nWhat finally shifted things for me wasn’t another system, but realizing how much my output depended on my internal state before I even touched a task.\n\nThere were days where the same to-do list felt effortless, and others where every small thing felt heavy. I used to interpret that as discipline problems. Over time it became clear that it was more about unacknowledged stress, low-grade anxiety, or mental fatigue that I was pushing through without noticing.\n\nBooks like _Deep Work_ and _Four Thousand Weeks_ helped me intellectually understand this, but knowing it and acting on it were two different things. Meditation helped to some extent. I used apps like Insight Timer and Calm on and off. They were useful for building awareness, but I often struggled to translate that awareness into day-to-day decisions.\n\nWhat started helping was building a habit of checking in before trying to be productive. Not in a formal way. Just pausing and asking myself what’s actually going on right now. Am I scattered, tense, avoiding something, or just tired. Sometimes journaling helped. Sometimes a short guided session did. Lately I’ve also been using an app called Thinking Me in those moments, mostly because it lets me articulate what I’m feeling instead of forcing myself into a predefined exercise.\n\nThe practical effect surprised me. I don’t necessarily work longer or harder. I abandon tasks earlier when my state is wrong, and return to them later with less friction. Counterintuitively, that has increased my overall output.\n\nProductivity for me stopped being about optimization and started being about timing and honesty. Doing the right thing at the wrong mental moment is still the wrong thing.\n\nCurious if others here have noticed something similar. Not tools specifically, but the idea that productivity issues often start before the task even begins.",

If you search, it’s called Final Version and it was created by Mark Forster. This blog explains it really well. It’s really the first time I’ve tried something that I think will stick for the long term. It’s only been a few months, but I’m still using this method when I’ve usually abandoned them before. I love that I can take “spoons” into consideration when I’m trying to tackle the list. \n\nhttp://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2021/11/16/the-final-version-perfected-fvp-instructions-reposted.html",

You've put into words something that I would not have been able to define, but you're so right.\n\nI have daily struggles with anxiety, motivation, mood, executive function, etc, and what you've said here has hit home so strongly! I have days where life is a breeze, but then others when the simplest task is just impossible. I've tried different apps, methods, etc & nothing seems to work. \n\nMy struggles are much worse at home than at work, and I've never really understood that. But at work I'm also a lot more in tune with myself internally. I've had days where I knew I wouldn't be able to cope with much so I've made allowances for it, turn my phone off, don't take calls, just do simple, mindless jobs & that seems to work. \n\nI've never really thought much about it, but it's very much what you've said here, it's my internal state that drives how well I function, not the actual task at hand, because I change it to suit my frame of mind. \n\nThere's always something that needs doing, I just make much more mindful choices about what task to take on each day at work. When I'm at home I float from task to task, nothing gets finished & I constantly feel like a failure.\n\nI'm going to really think about this, like a lot. If I can take the strategies that I use at work & apply them at home then maybe I can start to achieve some things here without killing my husband & kids in the process.\n\nThank you, @Fit_Guidance2029. You don't know me & I don't know you, but you've really helped me out here, so very much.",

I'd be working on something, get an email notification, check that, remember I needed to look something up, open a new tab, see an article I bookmarked last week, start reading that, then realize I forgot what I was originally doing.\n\nBy the end of the day I had 23 tabs open across two browser windows and couldn't tell you what half of them were for. Some were job postings I wanted to apply to later, some were articles for a project I'm working on, some were just random stuff I don't even remember opening. I know some of them were important but I have no idea which ones anymore.\n\nI'm starting to think having everything open \"just in case\" is making me less productive instead of more. But if I close stuff I'm afraid I'll forget about it completely, especially the job postings since I'm actively searching right now.\n\nHow do you deal with this? Do you just force yourself to close everything and trust you'll remember? Or is there some system that actually works for keeping track without drowning in open tabs?",

You can collapse the group out of the way when you don’t need it (keeps you from opening a random tab and getting distracted), and then expand them when you want to see them. \n\n2) I turned off my email notifications at work specifically because it would cause me to get distracted and switch tasks. I have my Outlook window open anyway, so the email notifications aren’t necessary. I check my emails manually when it’s convenient for me, rather than as soon as an email comes in. \n\n3) Have a pad of paper, a Word document/email, or a mini desktop whiteboard within reach at all times, and when you remember that you have to look something up, note that thing down. Noting it down keeps you from feeling like you have to hold it in your mind or deal with it immediately to avoid forgetting. Set aside time at the end of the day, or after finishing your current task, to do the things on the paper. \n\n4) There is no such thing as doing something quickly. Like “I’ll just quickly respond to this email,” or “I’ll just quickly look something up.” It’s never quick, because you have to context switch. If you think to yourself “I’ll just [do whatever] quickly and get it out of the way,” write it down on your notepad/whiteboard/Word document/email instead and get to it during its designated time slot. \n\n5) At some point, go through your tabs. First go through them and just close the ones you don’t need. DO NOT do anything other than “do I still need this?” And then click the X if you don’t. Then go through and see what’s left. Set reminders for things you want to do (ex. Set an alarm for Tuesday at 6:00 PM to complete a job application).  Once you’re done the task related to the tab, the last step should be closing the tab. Once the alarm goes off, either do the thing, snooze the alarm if you need a few minutes before you get to it, or re-set the alarm for a later time when you can actually do the thing.",

He’s based his productivity theories from commercial kitchens and their operating systems…long story short, definitely worth a read and for me it completely changed how I now approach things. So basically, now I’ll do a job (using work as my example) and once completed, I’ll close everything on my computer. If it’s been a long task, I’ll actually reboot. Then I’ll get a cloth and physically tidy and wipe my desk, fill up my water bottle, and then freshly start my next task. It’s like a reset of not only your physical space but a mind reset. Having that 3 minute clean up has made a massive difference and has allowed me to focus on the specific task at hand.",

Just a simple solution to this is - pick 1 thing to work, allocate time(this is the main thing) and then do according to time. Basically one needs to know about time and what we do at that time. Its overwhelming at the beginning lots of tabs and feels like nothing being done, but thats the only way to go. Just get used to it and have no gaps in days. You will figure it out on self.

Outside of that scheduled time, have your email minimized to avoid taking peeks to see if anything popped in. \n\n2. Start your day with a prioritized list of what needs to be done. Have a calendar event to block this time daily for the quick 15 minutes to do this. \n\n3. New ideas, notifications, and distractions will always pop up. Get into the habit of making a \"parking lot\" (paper or electronic list) of all items that are outside the scope of your planned list.\n\n4. The end of the day reflect on what was and wasn't accomplished. Crossing things off gives you a good feeling that you were productive, so this gives you a drive during the day to keep chugging along. \n\n5. Next morning, review yesterdays list and the parking lot and add to the list the things you want to accomplish that day. \n\n6. To avoid side tracking, add placeholders in your calendar as to what tasks you will work on when. \n\nThere are more things you can do (chunking, prioritization matrix, etc.), but this should be a good first step. Don't make it too complicated, or else the 'work' of implementing the system will demotivate you from executing it.",

I already don’t have the biggest short-video platform (rules don’t let me say it but it starts with a T) and use Instagram on safari. My biggest distractions are still instagram and Reddit honestly, but also random apps like NYT games and online shopping apps like Depop. These are apps that I’m not ready to totally give up, so I need creative solutions. \n\nFor example I’ve heard of things like “the Brick” where when you tap your phone to it certain apps lock down. **But ultimately I want to hear what’s worked the best for you in decreasing your screen time!**",

Once I figured out what it was exactly about social media, and my other habits that I enjoyed or kept me hooked, I was able to find healthier ways to fill that need.

On iphone there is a feature to turn your screen grayscale, this helps so much more than you'd think, when there is no color your phone is alot less stimulating\n\n2. Delete Reddit, dont use safari for IG keep those on your PC(I would delete IG entirely tbh). When you only use them on your PC I found that it helps you stay on the productive end of using them, also helps you be more present because there not always on hand\n\n3. Wear a watch(not a smart watch) if you don't already, this allows you to check the time without having to check your phone, it's a simple trick but it does wonders",

          "text": "Considering which phone you have, Android phones (at least samaung from my experience) tend to count actual time on phone, like how long app was open etc, while iphone also calculates idle time, like if you were on a phone call, had unlocked phone on home screen and didn’t turn it off. Those little stuff that often done eat up a lot of time. I remember when I switched between phones, I was like 4 hours average (from 8) on samsung phone, and suddenly I was at 6 hours on iphone, but I had even less apps and did everything the same. Then I noticed how time counting works. \n\nIronically cutting out instagram helped me the most. That was average of 2-3 hours daily eating up my time. And not intentional, but when feeling bored opening up phone just to see quickly what’s up and then for half an hour scroll on instagram. Just a quick peek turned into doomscroll ritual. Consider that every app is commitment you need to put in your 24 hours of life. For example for me time blocking never worked, so can’t say that’s best solution. Both the app blockers and actual time blocking for socials and games that is. But consider making using apps only inside of routines. And don’t obsess over numbers much, as long as you know how much time you dedicate to each app, and you are within that time limit, it’s good. Rest is up to you which apps to cut. My advice is to get off any socials if you want lower screen time. But you do you",

I have a \"deep focus\" mode (no social media, no games, no shopping apps, etc.) that I use as needed. In addition to blocking apps, you can block websites in your browsers (so you can't access Instagram or other sites through safari). Regularly using Brick has also helped decrease my urge to scroll even when my phone isn't in Brick mode. Absolutely worth the $60 for me. Just make sure you use it.",

But I think there are a couple effective strategies. First just getting a phone that completely takes out any instant dopamine time wasters like a dumb phone. One that has essentials that don’t consume all your time like Google Maps, Spotify, etc.. but don’t have social media apps. I never tried that but I have friends that sware by it. But sometimes I feel like going to that extreme makes it a lot easier to relapse and go back to your original phone. Then the other option which I think is easier and work better is to make your experience on your phone as boring and annoying as possible. Downloading apps like one sec that makes you wait before opening an app. Turning your screen grey. Things like that. But this by itself won’t fix your issue. What really worked for me was finding things in my life to do that were interesting and motivating me. Being more social, spending more time with friends, signing up for running races so I had to train more, working on starting a business, reading books, playing guitar and the list goes on. Find things that you really love to do and help you become a better person, and then when you are on your phone brain rotting you will genuinely feel guilty about it. I still have those brain rot sessions, but not close to as much as I use to have. I hope this helps!",

Now I’m walking around the house and my phone is somewhere in my room and I’m in the kitchen phone-free - small moments of progress to break the habit of reaching for it all the time. When I leave the house it is in my bag not my pocket - less easy to access. I am holding it less in general. Scrolling becomes inconvenient. I am choosing to interact with my phone instead of autopilot interacting with my phone. \n\nIf I’m traveling or something where I need my phone more regularly, I temporarily put on a normal case again to make life easier.

Planning, lists, tutorials all feel productive because they avoid that uncomfortable first step. Once I’m in, I’m fine!\n\nA few things that genuinely help me with this start resistance:\n\n\\- Lower the start bar to something almost stupidly small. something like \"open the document”, “write one sentence”, “run the script once”. This makes getting started a little easier.\n\nSeparate starting from continuing. I’ll often tell myself I’m only have to work for 5–10 minutes. Knowing I can stop removes a lot of resistance. Most of the time I keep going anyway, but the permission to stop is key.\n\nUse external triggers instead of relying on willpower. Timers work better than motivation. So does having something prompt you rather than deciding internally every time.\n\nTools that help me specifically:  \n– Forest: good for committing to a short focus block without overthinking  \n– Todoist (or similar), but only if you limit yourself to 1–3 tasks max  \n– SprintBuddy: a Telegram bot I use that sends one tiny 5-minute task per day. It teaches you how to study, be more productive, and set goals.\n\ndon’t aim to be productive, just aim to start! hope this helps!",

          "text": "Look, if you want to overcome that suck factor of starting a task, I would suggest you first of all make your tasks crystal clear from start to bottom to the end. Why is that? Because when your mind knows why you're doing it in the first place, what's the urgency, cost, benefits, plus when you know for how much time you'll do the task, for example it's 30 minutes or 60 minutes, and where will you do it? At your room, bed, or desk? Everything must be clear. Plus, you should know how your \"done\" will actually look like in each task, because without an end point, just starting, you may find it less interesting and less serious. Therefore, I would say clear everything in detail for yourself. Write the \"why\" in detail, why you're doing it in the first place. Plus, dive deeper, not only this much surface, but dive more deeper. And the second thing you should do in order to remove resistance is simply focus on task time rather than day time. Look, I've seen everyone, even me in the past, used to make this mistake of thinking that I got so much time left in the day, I'll do it then or later. But if you keep doing it, the resistance becomes even stronger. That's why just focus on the task time. How much time will this actually take? Like half an hour or just 1 hour, that's it? After doing it, you'll still have the whole time left in the day without any problem. So just do that. Focus on task time, how much time will it take, and just do it. The main thing I would say which can beat this resistance more better is having a strong why, as I said. So follow it. You'll make mistakes, it's fine, but constant practice will make you do this perfectly. Good luck. Peace.",

      "text": "I’m standing at a crossroads and need some advice.\n\nTo be honest, I struggle significantly with distraction. My attention span is very short—I can usually only focus on a task, read a book, or even meditate for about a minute before my mind wanders.\n\nI’m also a gamer. Currently, I’m playing *Raid: Shadow Legends*. For those who don't know, it has a lot of activities that require you to click every 1-5 seconds to auto-play. The problem is that this mechanic completely fragments my attention. For example, if I watch a 10-minute You-Tube video, I’ll get distracted 10 times just to click \"auto\" in the game. Cruelly, this distraction is reinforced because I get rewarded in-game for doing it.\n\nContinuing to play makes it nearly impossible to train my focus, which is crucial for my performance at work. However, the thought of quitting makes me feel incredibly empty—like life lacks meaning without it. I feel like I’d have to change my core nature and a part of my identity just to adapt to \"adult life.\"\n\nI also feel weak for not being able to balance both: satisfying my hobby (online gaming/collecting) while achieving success in my career.\n\nWhat should I do? Has anyone else dealt with this specific type of \"auto-play\" distraction?",

You can find one for yourself, too.\n\nThose games use addiction creating mechanisms against you. At least in Pokémon Go, you get addicted to moving around, so you trade attention for fitness. In other instances, it is pure evil. Mostly, you trade attention for rising frustration to push you into spending money.\n\nThe first step to fighting addiction is admitting you have a problem. Done.

Rewards are dragged out at just barely a fast enough rate to keep you hooked. There's often an early overload of stuff to make you feel invested and after a little bit of reasonable gameplay they turn the screws. \n\nSuddenly resources dry up, and the 2x production speed for watching an ad seems like a good deal. Oh you need more wood? Watch this ad and you can have a couple more! Oh you need more than that? well look at all of this wood and other resources you could get if only you gave us your payment details.\n\nIt's a really gross industry, and obviously not all mobile games are as predatory as the worst ones.

These are textbook dependency patterns. The game isn't filling a void—it's creating one and then selling you the temporary fix. That empty feeling when you think about quitting? That's withdrawal from a dopamine cycle, not evidence that the game gives your life meaning.\n\nThe fact that you're even asking strangers on Reddit means some part of you already knows.\n\nYou don't need to \"balance\" this. You need to treat it like what it is. There are actual resources for gaming addiction—support groups, therapists who specialize in it, even subreddits like r/StopGaming full of people who've been exactly where you are.\n\nYou're not weak for struggling with this.

Instagram was the hardest because I posted my artwork, kept up with classmates and got updates on my peripheral social circle through it, but I was losing hours on reels which was a feature I just couldn’t disable. I’d had it for years so I archived my work and grabbed a few phone numbers from people. the moment I permanently deleted my account I literally felt like I could breathe again. Like this huge weight that I didn’t know existed was lifted off my chest. \n\nI think you will benefit from a similar radical change.

          "text": "Not to belabor the obvious, but have you been assessed for ADHD or the like?\n\nIf your attention span really is that short, even for tasks that you know need doing, maybe it's more of a medical condition, and not a personal weakness? It may be less of a \"ditch the things that distract you\" type thing, and more of a cognitive therapy/medication issue. It is entirely possible that the reason you've been struggling with what feels like gaming addiction is more of a symptom of an undiagnosed learning/behavior disability than an actual personal failure in your part. I know it can feel like a cop out and a bit taboo to say \"it's not my fault, I'm just wired a little differently, so I need medication/therapy\" but I would not rule it out.\n\nI mean, distractions are real, and they do happen, but if you know they always happen, and that they get in the way of things you feel are important, maybe a checkup would be helpful, if for no other reason than to know for sure? Sometimes things that you feel are normal for you, are really not that normal for everyone else.\n\nTo use myself as an example:  \nI used to fail at college, falling asleep in classes and the like. I did not party, and went to bed early, and woke up at a reasonable time. I used to think maybe classes were really boring, and that I was just losing interest on what I was being taught, and that maybe that was why I wasn't doing well.  \nIt wasn't until much later (10+ years) that I learned I was suffering from sleep apnea and barely sleeping at all at night. I got that treated, have gone back to college and am currently maintaining a 3.8 GPA.\n\nSo, if you are really struggling, I'd suggest at least getting a screening done, in case it isn't just a simple issue of you having a temporary distraction getting on the way. You might discover that your life significantly improves from having figured out what was really going on in your life, in all kinds of ways. It may be that you don't need to stop enjoying gaming, or have your career take a hit because of it, but instead you just need the proper treatment to be able to do both successfully.",

That empty feeling when you think about quitting isn’t your identity disappearing… it’s withdrawal, and it does pass.\n\nThis probably isn’t about “balance” yet. You can’t rebuild focus while something is actively training distraction, especially auto-play games. That doesn’t mean quitting gaming forever, but it may mean stepping away from this type of game for a while.\n\nIf this kind of distractibility has always been there -school, reading, work - it might be worth looking into ADHD, not as a label, just as an explanation that changes what tools actually work.\n\nThe real question isn’t why you can’t handle both. It’s what you’re training your brain to do every day.",

I have done it for so long that my brain probably has efficient networks for dealing with that domain. Art hobbies on the other hand drain my focus in minutes because I don’t have as developed networks for that domain.\n\nI don’t think your gaming habit has much if at all to do with focus problems in other domains. Unless of course gaming addiction is pulling you away from other tasks. \n\nYour work is mentally very challenging, so naturally that’s going to quickly deplete your ability to focus, no matter how motivated and interested you are. Youtube videos on the other hand are mostly either hard core educational about some complex topic, or mildly curious entertainment. Both are hard to focus on.",

I’d start things strong, then drift the moment results weren’t instant. I consumed a lot of content, ideas, sectors, and “what if” scenarios. Fantasized hard. Executed almost nothing. Net result: more confusion, less progress.\n\nWhen I tried planning 2026, it hit me planning, researching, and ideating give me dopamine. That’s the trap. I don’t want that dopamine anymore.\n\nSo I’ve decided something very different.\n\nI’m not planning 2026.\n\nNo yearly vision. No roadmap. No big strategy decks.\nJust one rule:\n\nFinish what I start.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nRight now my biggest problems are basic:\n\t•\tPhone addiction (7+ hours/day)\n\t•\t3–4 hours Reddit\n\t•\t2–3 hours YouTube\n\t•\tRest = shows/scrolling\n\t•\tMaking decisions based on how I feel\n\t•\tStopped working out for ~6 months\n\t•\tTerrible focus due to short-form dopamine\n\t•\tFinancial + mental instability\n\nSo my real goal for 2026 is simple:\nGet my feet back on the ground… financially, mentally, physically.\n\nWhat that looks like:\n\t•\tPlan one day at a time, nothing more\n\t•\t20–30 minutes of workout daily\n\t•\tRebuild focus (meditation/spiritual practice, even if my mind wanders)\n\t•\tCut down scrolling aggressively\n\t•\tNo exploring new ideas or sectors\n\t•\tNo “research rabbit holes”\n\t•\tOnly execute what’s already on my plate\n\t•\tFeelings don’t get a vote\n\n2026 for me is not about growth hacks, vision boards, or 10-year plans.\nIt’s about discipline, boring consistency, and finishing.\n\nThat’s my plan.\n\nThanks to everyone who commented earlier. I read everything, reflected, and this is what actually makes sense for me right now.",

Do not at any point compare yourself. This is YOUR year. YOUR life’s curriculum. Very few people dedicate time to this like you are.\n- don’t get stuck on which scheduling tool to use but fyi I didn’t really like google calendar as a planning tool because it doesn’t allow me to check off tasks once I’ve done them and the interface looked cluttered when I scheduled my goals and checkpoints in. I ended up using excel, an analog habit tracker, and some other tools but use what works for you…it’ll ultimately be different for everyone \n\nAbove all rooting for you. I know how thoughtful and fulfilling yet challenging  this process is because I did it. ",

Others may feel differently about this take, but:\n\nI'd say keep it high level at the one year mark. Define what you want, where you're aiming and what you're happy to sacrifice in return for those outcomes.\n\nThe James Clear quote \"You don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems,\" resonates with me on this.\n\nConsistency is king and you're a process. When you get down to it, what you're looking for here is 365 days well spent.\n\nMaster the day; Master the year.

What are things you want to do more of, keep the same, and do less of? Look at journals and/or your calendar can be really helpful for this.  \n2. Some other life domains to consider from your list: Social / Community, Family, Romantic, Spiritual, Play  \n3. Do some reflection on each domain. What's going well? Where might you want to improve?  \n4. Think about your goals for the year broadly, both across domains and in general. For each goal, try to figure out what success looks like.  \n5. Ask yourself \"if I could only work on 1 goal, what would it be.\" Put that at the top of your list. Then do the same until you have a list of 3-5 goals that you know are your top priorities.  \n6. Also make a plan for Q1, using a similar process (review your yearly goals, and the things upcoming in the quarter, figure out how to move things forward that you want to for Q1).  \n7. At the beginning of each week, make a quick plan for your week to stay on track with Q1 goals.  \n8. At the beginning of each day, make a quick plan for your day to stay on track for the week.  \n9. At the beginning of Q2, review Q1, review your annual goals, review the upcoming quarter, and make a plan.\n\netc.\n\nI hope this helps!",

If something else pops up, no problem - just move or delete another block. By deleting something from your ideal week, you're making a conscious decision that the other event is more important. So it makes you think twice before saying \"yes\" to something silly.\n\nAfter a week of following this, revisit. What's working and what's not? Adapt the recurring blocks as needed.\n\nI'd also suggest adding major milestones to your calendar as well and keeping track of them via a year-view calendar.

If I keep the streak going, great, but if I miss a day, it suddenly feels worse than if I’d never tracked it at all.\n\nA silly example, but imagine a toothbrush counter at 5,000+ uses. Missing one day doesn’t just reset a number, it makes every future brush remind you of the break. At least that’s how it feels for me.\n\nI’ve found that simpler systems, like just checking something off and moving on, actually work better for my brain. Less pressure, less “I ruined it” feeling.\n\nCurious how others experience this. Does gamification genuinely help you stick with things, or does it sometimes backfire?",

No streaks, no XP, just “did I show up today, yes or no.” Even better if yesterday doesn’t matter at all.\n\nI think gamification helps some people start, but for consistency it can backfire if you’re prone to all-or-nothing thinking.

What shows up repeatedly is that gamification works short term, but over time the streak or score becomes the thing you are managing, not the habit itself. Once it breaks, the system flips from motivating to punitive, even if nothing meaningful actually changed. Simple check and move on setups tend to hold up better because they measure completion, not perfection.

Look, we're AI-native\n\n If I can replace your entire \"AI Logic\" with a 10-line Regex script or a simple SQL query, your product isn't Advanced. It's inefficient.\nI got into an argument about this recently where someone claimed that removing AI features is a \"downgrade\" for a startup. They argued it makes the product less relevant.\n\nThat is complete BS.\n\nRelevance for a startup isn't about using the shiny new toy. It's about survival. If you are burning $0.03 per request to do something a Python function does for free, you aren't cutting edge. You are just bad at math.\n\nThe  \"Upgrade\" in a startup isn't moving from SQL to Vector DB. It's moving from Burning Cash to \"Default Alive.\"\n\nIf you replace a slow, expensive, hallucinating LLM call with a boring, instant, free if/else statement, you didn't downgrade your tech. You upgraded your business model.\n\nWe need to stop glorifying complexity. A boring stack that costs $0 and runs instantly is superior to a \"Modern AI Stack\" that burns runway, purely for the sake of hype.\n\nAm I wrong? Or are we all just pretending that \"AI Wrappers\" are actually good engineering?",

No zero days.\n\nI tried living by that, and honestly it backfired hard.\n\nForcing myself to do the thing every single day, even when I was mentally drained or just not in it, didn’t make me disciplined. It made me dread it. What started as motivation slowly turned into obligation, and then into resentment.\n\nWhat I’ve noticed is that progress didn’t come from never missing a day. It came from not quitting altogether. Some weeks I’m locked in and doing a lot. Other weeks I barely touch it. And somehow, that uneven rhythm has been way more sustainable than pretending I’m a machine.\n\nI’m starting to think consistency isn’t about daily streaks. It’s about coming back after you fall off.\n\nCurious if anyone else feels this way, or if this is just me rationalizing bad habits.",

While I'm not even close to having figured out a good system or rhythm for myself, I think the key factor is that you should rarely if ever be made to feel like you're behind and need to catch up. That incline is what feeds the dread and encourages avoidant behavior. If you can get rid of timelines and just make it about progress, I think it gets easier to build a routine that won't crumble when it's invariably interrupted.",

Do Yoga every evening/night (we are making this one a family activity). 4. Read a devotional on the bible app I have. 5. Read at least a chapter of a book a day. 6. Do a sleep meditation at night (I have been struggling with sleep for years and hoping this helps). 7. Do a 24 hour fast every week.\nWhat are your habits?",

The time of resolutions, goals and jobs to do better. \n\nHowever I believe the new year is not the time for big changes. Resolutions are rarely kept so why set them in January? \n\nThe other thing is the January gym rush! Wait until February or even March and you'll start your gym with machines that are free and not clogged up with new year resolutioners! Just one example. \n\nSure think about goals for the year, but I say only do the  term goals you can start later in the year. Spend January planning not goal setting and achieving. That's my POV. If a goal is worth anything it's worth starting later on when the Xmas, new year and holidays period bill paying is complete.\n\nSo I make the same joke, a very poor one but it has a purpose. I say my new year's resolution is to not make any. Once you've broken a resolution you take the stress away or the pressure away. It takes the need to keep to something that isn't really a good goal for you.\n\nI do however feel setting resolutions at other times of the year to have more value. So I'll start big changes then not in January.",

Reels, random snaps, nothing I even cared about.\n\nWhat really made it hard to ignore was actually looking at my screen time. I always assumed it was not that bad, but seeing the hours added up was kind of brutal. At that point I couldn’t really pretend it wasn’t a problem anymore.\n\nI didn’t do anything extreme after that. Just small changes. Leaving my phone in another room when I needed to focus. Not touching social apps first thing in the morning so my brain wasn’t fried before I even started the day. Checking screen time once in a while just to keep myself honest.\n\nIt all sounds pretty basic, but it made a bigger difference than I expected. I’m still not perfect and I still get distracted, but I’m not stuck in that half-working, half-scrolling state all the time anymore.

Then, I'd lose interest in the mornings thinking \"I can't possibly work in the mornings. I can't concentrate it's just a waste of time.\"\nSo I'd go back to my night owl lifestyle telling myself, \"I'm not cut out for morning work.\"\n\nFinally, I found a brilliant solution: I stopped searching for the answer to this question or rather I stopped asking it altogether\n\nInstead of constantly questioning myself and trying to find the answer, I started focusing on what I was doing and how I was doing it. I noticed that I could accomplish a lot of tasks that required high concentration and precision in the early morning when it was quiet\n\nI realized that \"productive nights\" were just a last resort. I wasted time in the afternoon and didn't accomplish anything, so I had to stay up late at night to get the work I needed done.\n\nOnce I stopped forcing myself to stick to a specific schedule I stopped blaming myself for not being consistent. Some days I get a good job done before noon. Other days, I finish it after dinner. And some days honestly, it doesn't happen at all - and that's okay too.\n\nI wonder if anyone else has given up on staying up late and going to bed early and felt more natural afterward?!",

And then we stress when we don't fit perfectly. I think a lot of it comes down to just paying attention to how you actually feel instead of how you think you're supposed to feel based on some label you gave yourself at 22. Some days I'm up early and crushing it, some days I'm useless until 2pm. Both are fine.\n\n\n\nThe pressure to optimize every hour of every day is exhausting anyway.

However, at some point, we all have to put on our big person, pants and nut up about facing failure or disappointment.  It’s gonna happen. I can promise you that you will both fail and be disappointed over and over and over again just like everybody else.  It’s not about avoiding disappointment. It’s about the strategies you use for recovering from it.  When facing a task you don’t wanna do ask yourself what is the worst thing that could happen if I engage with this task? Really think this through. Is anyone gonna die? If so, I might rightfully back away, but if not, will you be left bankrupt or homeless?  If not, you’re probably just be frustrated or annoyed.  Those are emotions we all need to learn to handle.  Maybe you take one task you don’t wanna do figure out the worst thing. Do that one task and that’s it for the day maybe tomorrow do one more task, etc. Maybe the following week you can tackle two tasks a day. Resilience it’s just like a muscle it develops with cognitive workouts.",
