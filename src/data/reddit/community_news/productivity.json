      "text": "A few weeks back I felt really stuck in my ways. I was working, did volunteer work and hours of yoga and meditation but I wasn’t getting the results I wanted. Then I talked to a Swami (a monk) from Isha Yoga Center and he gave me some advice. He said to do everything without expectation. He said to do everything simply for the sake of doing it without worrying about the result. Because when you do something and expect a certain result, you are inviting the past into the present. You remember a certain result and you are expecting the same thing to happen again.\n\nSo I tried doing everything without expectations. Simply be present with whatever I was doing and doing it well. To my amazement I started feeling so blissful. Especially after doing my yoga and meditation. But even at work, time was going by much faster and I was really productive. All it takes is a simple shift in attitude from unwillingness to willingness. It’s almost contradictory that letting go of the result, and simply involving oneself with the process, gets the result. When you have one eye on the goal you only have one eye to find the way.",

          "text": "The reason behind what you describe is called \"reward prediction error\". If a predicted reward is lower than expected, then your dopamine goes down. When your dopamine is down, you feel unmotivated. So when you always have high expectations, then the chances to meet your reward predictions are a lot lower, and chances are high that you are constantly sending your dopamine to the basement. Btw one of the reasons why you should not scroll in the morning:  \nYou wake up, have been 8h offline and have high expectations for what you missed in the meantime. But if Trump hasn't invaded Venezuela, then the answer is: you missed nothing. So chances are high that you are starting with a dopamine deficit most of your days if you scroll first thing in the morning. More tips and resources like this on the wiki of r/stopscrolling btw, hope this helps",

When you focus only on the step in front of you, your nervous system calms down and you get into flow more easily. That is why time feels faster and effort feels lighter.\n\nThe paradox is real.

My mind would be racing with guilt about my freelance work or the Excel skills I needed to learn, but I felt physically hijacked by old patterns.\n​I finally realized that the more I messed with my mind (criticizing myself, feeling guilty), the more I got stuck. As Sadhguru says, \"The mind is a survival tool, not a liberation tool.\" My mind was just doing its job staying in the \"safe\" loop of the bed.\n\n​I stopped fighting the effect (my thoughts) and started working on the cause: my nervous system. Here is the 2-minute \"Somatic Loop\" I use to actually get to my desk:\n\n​The Toe-to-Head Tension: While still under the covers, I tense my toes for 5 seconds, then release. I work my way up through my calves, thighs, stomach, and face. It manually signals to the body that the \"sleep loop\" is over. It’s like a jump-start for your energy (Prana).\n\n​Sensory Closure: Once I stand up, I immediately splash cold water on my face, feet, and arms. This sensory input tells my brain the \"Lazy Phase\" is officially finished.\n\n​The \"Unfolding\" Goal: I don't think about my freelance projects yet. I just tell myself to unfold my yoga mat. Once that mat is open, my body recognizes the \"Active Loop.\" Taking that one tiny physical initiative makes the rest of the day follow naturally.\n\n​Life is a phenomenon, not a thing to be fixed. Stop criticizing yourself for being \"unproductive.\" You aren't lazy; you’re just stuck in a survival loop. Take responsibility for your physical energy first, and the focus will follow.",

But I never actually DO anything with it.\n\nSaving feels like learning without the actual work of learning.\n\nI tried forcing myself to write one sentence about WHY I'm saving something before I hit the button. It helped. I save way less now. But I still have this massive graveyard of \"I'll get to it eventually\" content sitting there.\n\nI'm curious, who else have this problem of endlessly collecting but never using what they save?

I do find Reddit extremely helpful, in finding that you are not alone really in anything, so it turns out. And that so many fellow humans have great advice and thoughts on how to proceed, change and just acknowledge.  It's OKAY.   \n\n This may lead into more of a separate post question ... Especially when you realize you are the \"older person,\" ie. early 50s. I have physical hoarded things and now digitally.  I used Evernote for a long time and really loved it, it seems to have everything, I could at least \"hoard,\" in one place, instead of bookmarks, notes, etc. etc.   However, now it is a paid cloud thing, and I don't know...is there anything out there that can be used, where the things are saved on your desktop, not the cloud?  My evernote account was constantly being hacked or attempted log ins.  So I stopped using it. But really it was the closest thing to keeping things organized.     I continually \"search,\" on the compute because like you, I know the info is there....but oh where oh where did I put it?  Safari, Google or Firefox, notes, post its or a word doc. etc.      Am I just \"too old,\" in thinking there is some app/software that can be used off line, not only cloud based?",

I start work already carrying unfinished thoughts, half remembered links, open loops from yesterday, and that constant feeling of don’t forget this. So even simple tasks feel heavy because I’m constantly switching context.\n\nI tried fixing this by pushing harder and adding systems, but that only made it worse. What helped was doing the opposite, reducing how much my brain had to hold at once.  \n  \nI started dumping things immediately instead of keeping them in my head: links I wanted to revisit, threads I found useful, ideas, references. Once something was saved somewhere I trusted, my brain stopped circling it.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that I’m not bad at starting work, I’m bad at stopping. Working from home blurred everything. I’d tell myself just one more thing and suddenly hours were gone. Setting a hard stop time felt irresponsible at first, but it actually helped me focus more during the day because work had a clear end.\n\nI also realized how much time I was spending just typing emails, Slack, docs. It felt busy but slow. Using dictation for rough drafts and replies cut screen time more than I expected, and that alone made me less mentally fried by evening.\n\nI’m not magically disciplined now, but my days feel lighter. Less frantic, more contained. For me, productivity wasn’t about better time management. It was about reducing mental load so my brain could actually rest between tasks.",

But it saved me hours that would have been spent emailing lecturers, trawling Reddit/Stack Overflow, or hunting for textbooks that explained a concept in a way that clicked for me.\n\nIt absolutely can make people dumber though, and I've seen it firsthand. Once models were good enough to ace difficult assignments (late 2024/early 2025), a lot of students who used to get around 70% on coursework and 70% on exams started to get 90%+ on coursework, while failing the exam for the same topic.",

Whenever you have a thought or any topic to talk about with ChatGPT, just write that down instantly somewhere in a note app. Don't instantly open ChatGPT itself, and make a time window for when you'll open it, like when you have your main work done so it doesn't distract you. So at that time, you'll just ask exactly what you noted. \n\nNo judgment, but to really reduce this addiction, try walking more. Yes, I know, not joking.

Over time, you'll see yourself approaching ChatGPT less, and you'll be much more calm and grounded. Thanks for sharing it, friend.

      "text": "TL;DR- meditation helped me realise what living in the moment means.\n\nI was really fed up with my procrastination and overthinking problems. Whenever I tried to study or sit down to do my work, I would just start procrastinating. I would end up watching reels or thinking about random stuff. Other times, while just sitting there, I would go completely blank and get consumed in my thoughts.\n\nThese problems were making it really difficult for me to do anything. I was constantly stuck in a position where I wanted to work hard and focus on my studies, but because of all this overthinking about the future, what will happen, whether I will get a job or not, it kept hampering my studies.\n\nThis kept going on until I realized something. Around that time, I started meditating to improve my focus and to get some distance from my thoughts. And honestly, it turned out to be a wonderful decision.\n\nIt’s been six months now, and one of the most beautiful realizations that helped me overcome my overthinking and procrastination was this. All we really have is this moment. There is no past or future in the way we imagine it. What we call the future is something we only ever experience as the present. We never actually experience the future as future. All thoughts about it stay in our head. Experientially, we can only live in the present.\n\nThis realization might sound simple. I had heard it so many times before, live in the moment, focus on the present, but I could never really digest it. I just wasn’t able to grasp it. I’ve also heard this from Sadhguru, that “In reality, there is only now. If you know how to handle this moment, you know how to handle eternity.” But earlier, it stayed as just a quote for me.\n\nMeditation did something different. It was like it planted this understanding inside me. After meditating, this was no longer just a thought. It became real for me. It became a realization.\nAnd naturally, I was able to focus on what was in front of me. I stopped constantly thinking about what would happen in the future. I just knew that all I can do is work now. That’s what is in my hands. What I cannot do, I anyway won’t be able to do. But what I can do, I don’t want to miss it. So I'll do whatever I can.\n\nThis helped me a lot. Just felt like sharing this.\n\nThank you for reading.",

Is that necessary for you , do you have time , are you ready to spend you time on it ? And be satisfied from it , at some time I started to think like this and now I feel wow! I have changed",

I like how you described the shift from knowing the idea of living in the present to actually experiencing it. That is a big difference. Meditation seems to create that small gap between you and your thoughts, where you can choose to just do what is in front of you instead of fighting your mind. Focusing on what you can do right now, and letting go of what you cannot control yet, sounds like a much healthier way to approach productivity. Thanks for sharing this so honestly.",

          "text": "Possibly ADHD. This is a huge trait in people who suffer from it.\n\n\nYour brain needs that perceived pressure to take action because the prefrontal cortex doesn't spool up like it does in the average person. \n\n\nSome tricks that help me support my laggy brain (and will help you even if you do not have ADHD)\n\n\n• Good sleep hygiene \n\n\n• Exercise\n\n\n• Increase protein in your diet or at least less carbs to avoid the sugary scatter brain fog.\n\n\nThese may sound unrelated, but what those changes do is help support an already struggling brain. Which allows you to just do what you gotta do vs needing the pressure of \"the last minute\"\n\n\nNow for more practical tips:\n\n\nHave routines.\n\n\nOnce you establish them, they become habit which removes a ton of mental load that creates friction for when you need to leave.\n\n\nNo more stressing your morning tasks because they're consistent and you know what time they need to happen by. \n\n\nI broke mine down to be fairly granular and have every major task blocked out for my mornings.\n\n\nHere's my basic list of tasks:\n\n\n• 430am - wake up I immediately hydrate and take my medicine\n\n\n• I get dressed and prepped for my run\n\n\n• I head out and run for about 20 mins\n\n\n• then take a shower\n\n\n• get dressed for work\n\n\n• feed and water my pets \n\n\n• cook breakfast and empty my dishwasher \n\n\n• eat my breakfast\n\n\n• brush my teeth \n\n\n• pack my bag\n\n\n• flex time - this helps me make sure I've gotten or have thought of everything I need for the day and really helps me with the space of time where I'm like, \"am I ready to go? I feel like I'm forgetting something, I can't just go now can I?\" This time is terrible for me as it's basically self-sabotage cus I won't leave even though I am early. But having a block of free time helps a lot.\n\n\n• head out the door for work by 7:20am\n\n\nNow with the help of AI (I use Gemini) I told it to remember that I do all those things every morning and that I wake up at 4:30 am and needed to leave my house by 7:20am. \n\n\nIt then assigned time blocks for each of those tasks and since I specifically asked it to remember this as my m-f morning routine it can reprioritize my morning schedule based off what time I wake up or if I wake up earlier or later. Super helpful and flexible.\n\n\nOf course you can always do it manually, but man leveraging technology is super convenient.\n\n\nThese changes have transformed me from a chronically 10-15 mins late to work every day guy for decades, to early and consistent arrivals. I still struggle with appointments that fall on times not accounted for within my routines, but I no longer believe myself to be a chronically late person (the mindset shift that resulted from the above guide is very helpful for this as well). I could go on for ages, but there's a lot of work to do for optimizing yourself.",

Let me tell you what lateness says to other people: it says my time is more valuable than your time. I don’t value you or your time enough to not keep you waiting.  If you’ve ever taken a class, they started on time.  You were there.   \n\nMake a pack with yourself to be 15 minutes early to absolutely everything. This is for two reasons one if you’re 15 minutes early, you won’t be late and you’ll learn to feel what it feels like to wait for somebody.  You’re 100% right that when you get a big girl job you’ll lose it in a heartbeat if you’re late.  I have a girlfriend who would say that she’s always late, but she’s an anesthesiologist and she manages to get herself to work. In time to start on time. Do you think a surgeon is gonna wait for an anesthesiologist who’s late?  I really think cultivating empathy for the other people in your life who wait for you chronically is enough for you to change your behavior.  \n\nDo you have a narrative probably even Identity that you are just someone who’s late. But you can change that narrative by just deciding that you’re someone who’s on time and you’re on time because you respect other people in their time and you want them to respect you and yours.  Say that to yourself over and over again and pretty soon you’ll start to believe it and after that you’ll start to live it.",

Of course there's the house chores and taking care of a toddler which consumes some of my time. Everything feels so hard though. Even making food, I can barely manage to cook a meal before 12pm. But I want to be more productive. I really want to have a good routine where we eat breakfast, spend at least 1hr outside, \"homeschool\" my kid by teaching him numbers, letters, etc, read books and have some physical activity multiple times a week. I'd like to start going to yoga or ballet classes again. I'd like to go see my friends more often. I'd like to finish creative projects. I'd even like to continue studies.\n\nI just feel like I'm soooo demotivated and even if I try to force myself to do these things I just can't find the motivation. I know ideally I'd need discipline instead of motivation but how do I create that? Worth mentioning is that I'm severely mentally ill currently, I got a food poisoning a year ago that triggered severe emetophobia that gives me 24/7 debilitating anxiety and frequent panic attacks, I am seeking help for it as quickly as I can, as quickly as the healthcare is giving me appointments basically. It has caused me to become very underweight, barely eat, barely have energy and also be very scared of doing normal things like going outside the house. But I'm really working on that cos fuck living like this, I want to get better.\n\nAre there any other SAHM's who have gotten out of a slump and gotten themselves more more productive and motivated?  \n",

          "text": "First give yourself grace! \n\nThe phone is the problem. Been there…multiple times….it just sucks you in. Video games too….time just passes by so quickly… In am turn on radio (we have old fashion cheap atenna one or I use my radio app on phone)…I find that if I avoid going on my phone in am and just say okay going to do dishwasher then after that I get little motivated then I see something else and move on etc. every time you complete something even the smallest you get a dopamine rush which in turn is motivation to go for that feeling. Example…Do laundry for 5 minutes…I grab a couple items and then say I’m going to move on after those things and before I know it I’m done with it all. It’s like I have to trick my mind into wanting to do things at first to get myself going (and for some reason my brain doesn’t recall what I have up my sleeve). I think for me it’s because I have insomnia and get like 5 hours sleep a night that I have days of low motivation. I find when I prioritize sleep and go to bed and get at least 6 hours that I feel more motivated and energized next day. I also have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and feel that affect my energy levels daily. Lastly if doomscrolling on facebook and comparing how you are to what people want you to see of them it’s a horrible cycle. I find when I take a break from social media that my brain resets and I feel more recharged and refreshed. (I was able to go a year without it only because I couldn’t recall password after switching phones.)\n\nI also understand the food thing a bit. Due to my thyroid I had to go without gluten and soy and my son has milk allergy so it’s challenging to satisfy everyone. I used to find meals sooo easy growing up cooking for family of 9 and now for the 4 of us it’s so exhausting and totally opposite of motivation.  Good that you are seeking help for what you are going through. I deal with anxiety too and I find that in the intense moments that deep breaths and focusing on something positive best I can. \n\nGoing out whether it’s grocery, Costco, Walmart (hard one for some reason) and school events (big one) for me I find that I have to talk myself into just going out because i find once I do I feel so energized because of the endorphins received from conquering that moment. It gets easier each time. (I have social anxiety and feel the world much more intensely than others around me. My son is the same way. My other son is like his dad and just goes with flow.)\n\nI find prayer in the morning and multiple times per day and just saying I can’t do this without You and asking for energy and strength and help with what I’m dealing with in the moment especially. It’s like saying I can’t do this on my own and the weight is lifted a bit. \n\nHopefully this helps a bit…you’re not alone! I also have found that my hormones out of whack after kids had something to do with it. I go to functional dr that prescribes me made for me cream based hormones. I get tested every 6 months sometimes 4 months until balances. I’m low on progesterone (had to take before I was able to get pregnant and during) and low on testosterone. Being on very low dose of testosterone this last year my motivation, libido, energy, anxiety all got better. So maybe your hormones could be out of whack as well…something to look into. Make sure you go to functional Dr for this and not just taking something that someone else can take as it’s not one size fits all. Look up symptoms of low testosterone, progesterone etc. see if it might be worth looking into. If your hormones are low, it can cause soooo many issues with entire body system. \n\nWith exercise find something that you used to love. For me it was Billy Blanks Tae Bo from high school. I found on YouTube and was able to get back into it…until I broke my wrist rollerblading.  I told myself I’ll just do short video like 10 minute and then eventually I would do another and then longer videos. I could do right in living room with the kids (watch those kicks! My son learned the hard way lol) or while they napped. \n\nEverything is hard at first but after your brain expects it to happen at certain time of day or even just happen in your day then it gets easier. For me I exercised in am before showering because if I showered I would end up working out at like 10pm because I would keep putting off. \n\nBest of luck and many blessings to your journey ahead.",

I go on my laptop when I have my morning coffee for a quick IG + Reddit scroll and oftentimes I don’t even touch my phone till noon (minus my wake up alarm).

Like of course you're not motivated to do anything else - you get the same (or better!) dopamine hit immediately by sitting on your couch as you would making an effort at anything. \n\nI used ScreenZen and put a lock for midnight to 11:59pm for all apps that suck my time up. Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, Messenger. Basically only left texting, calls, and some puzzles. Set it so I couldn't delete Screenzen. Had my boyfriend lock the settings behind a PIN, so I can't even unblock or adjust time settings or anything.\n\nIt's been two days and it's pissing me offfff. But at the same time the boredom driving me to do other stuff, even if it's just wandering around my house. Or read a bad romantasy book. Or use reddit at my computer (which has an extension to block all social media after 30 minutes as well) instead of being locked in on the couch.

          "text": "I'm a SAHD. I take care of my nephew, and little brother daily. I also find time to work on my businesses as well.\n\nPhone use is tough for everyone. We all use it too much. My parents do it. My grandma does it. I do, and so does my nephew and little brother. Everyone.\n\nHonestly my advice is simple.\nYou already know how much your phone is taking away from your life. That's an amazing start.\n\nThe fix is to build better systems. It'll take some time, but it is incredibly simple. Just requires being conscientious. You need to know what's happening, go places, and make rules.\n\nThere are 3 core techniques required:\n- Awareness: We all have certain triggers which ruin our days.\nLike maybe scrolling in bed. A late start to the day. Getting distracted by our phones instead of cooking food. Things like that. Make a note of every single one of these.\n\n- \"if-then\" method. You need rules. This is the \"logic\" of your new system. If this happens, then this happens. What you need to do is edit your logic.\n\"If I think of starting yoga again, then I will sign up for a yoga class within the week.\" Follow that new rule. \n\"If I start scrolling on my phone before bed. Then I will put my phone in the drawer.\" Follow that new rule.\nSome habits need more rules.\n\"If I still can't sleep after placing my phone in the drawer, then I will meditate.\" \"If meditation doesn't put me to sleep, I will just ruminate all night.\"\nSometimes your rules won't work. Be aware of this, and add more logic and rules. This is how you build a core system.\n- \"butt in chair\" method. Your environment determines what you do the most.\nIf you are still in bed, all you can do is sleep, or scroll on your phone.\nEven if you are tied to your phone, get out of bed, and go to where your next task is.\nPhysically move on with your day. Naturally, many people will put their phone down. And start doing the next task. Some don't.\nThat's why you also need to also employ rules. Such as, \"no phone use while walking\". These simple rules can break how stuck you are.\n\nAs your habits develop, more and more of the problem will go away. Phone use is a pervasive problem. To fix it you need a pervasive solution, that breaks the habit everywhere.\n\nTldr; You need to develop systems. It's complicated. Because life is complicated. Having more rules and following them makes it easier. Just keep adding more rules. Physically move on with your day. You'll get more things done.",

Then do literally anything. Eat a snack, play with your kid’s toys, draw a picture, stretch, do a tiny bit of cleaning (like put the dishes in the dishwasher, or vacuum one room), take a nap. Really doesn’t matter what you’re doing, it’ll still help you train your brain to not rely on your devices, which in turn can help with anxiety and depression, sleep schedules, and other things. Maybe start with 20 minutes of purposeful no devices time (but also don’t have it in your pocket). You’ll find that when your brain isn’t distracted it might get a little bored and then chores and other productive (but not super fun) things seem more interesting",

          "text": "Here are some things I'd recommend. I have ADHD and these things can help me. You obviously didn't mention ADHD, but the sense of paralysis resonated with me.\n\nWrite a to do list on a whiteboard/paper (not phone, physical is more satisfying). But make sure to include everything you already KNOW you'll do, like feed and bathe your child, and make sure to tick those off. Just because they're the 'default' tasks doesn't mean they're not an achievement. Also put on some things that are extremely easy and accessible, like opening the windows for a few hours, or filling a huge jug of water, then tick off the box if you drink it all. \n\nNext try and find someone who can visit you easily, a neighbour or friend, who would be happy to do a short walk around the neighbourhood regularly, at the start of the day. When you come home you'll feel like you've already done a big useful task, your kid will be happier, you'll be more clear headed. Don't push yourself to walk longer than you're comfortable with, the routine is important and also the fact that someone else is involved, especially if they turn up at your door and there's no organising needed. \n\nSee if you can batch cook with your spouse together, put music on to make it a nicer activity. Boiling loads of eggs at once and putting them in the fridge for example, or pre-chopping veg and putting them in freezer bags. When you order food, focus on easy foods to grab, like bananas. (Edited to add here, I just noticed your issues with food in your post. For now, I'd say throw the idea of 'healthy' out the window if it means you can just focus on getting calories. If that means that custard and crackers are the only things you feel safe eating, eat that custard and crackers till the cows come home, and worry about adding nutrients once you have more strength. Personal experience)\n\nTry and see a doctor if you can. It could be something very important physically that might get overlooked as 'anxiety' or 'postnatal depression', like it might turn out you're low on iron. \n\nTry the app Bearable. It helps you track symptoms, energy, and mood in relation to factors in your life, like sleep, what you ate, what tasks you did, and it's very customisable and cheap. It made me realise the things that consistently make me have a good day are reading a good book and eating enough protein. You can look back on the past and see patterns, too. And you can add to your to-do list 'complete Bearable entry for today', along with that walk if you did one.\n\nOther people have great advice and points, but I wanted to add these",

          "text": "\"accept I have a terrible memory\" -- please just dont do that. That kind of self perception is not gonna help.\n\nHere is what I would do:\n\n1. \"I used to watch tones of educational videos\" -- watch less, putting less content in your mind gives it more space. There is no advantage to overloading it. Its not that your memory is terrible, its just that every person has a certain capacity of what they can remember, you know? And that depends on sleep, what vitamins you take, your overall energy and other mental load from work or school...etc\n\nDont blame it Terrible, just watch less. Understand just because you consume for longer doesn't mean you will learn more. If anything, it works the opposite way. That's where I would start.\n\n2. Read physical books. It's less stimulating (less load on your brain), easier to get back to, you can underline or bookmark ideas you find fascinating...If you go and buy a thick book filled with ideas, you can quite literally reread it for a year, constantly connecting the lessons and insights to something in the real world, finding new ways to apply it or explain something in your life.\n\n3. \"its not on subjects I get to apply/talk about on a daily basis.\" Don't treat learning as performance. If you are learning outside of school, you are learning because you want, because it is fun. Honestly, you sound a lot like me (I want to be knowledgeable and curious). I am also intellectual, with a thirst for knowledge. But look at what you wrote. Do you have to remember everything? Does it need to be applicable? SAYS WHO? For me personally, interesting information is like... sweets or cupcakes for my mind. It tastes good to know something interesting that most don't know. Even if you cant apply it, knowledge gives you charisma/aura in social situations (when used correctly).  Dont stress over remembering everything. Your free time is not a test or an exam. F\\*ck it, if you learn 1 thing from an hour of podcasts, who says that's a bad thing? its your free time. You dont have to measure efficiency or \"productivity\" on something you enjoy.\n\nConclusion:  \n\\- Memory depends on your energy and sleep\n\n\\- The key during learning is not to overload and overstimulate yourself.\n\n\\- Learn on your own rules. What's interesting will stay, what's not will leave  \n\\-----  \nHope this helps",

If you move an item from one day to another bc you didn’t have time for it, it should have been a task. \n\nTask dates do not mean “do on this day”, rather: “No point looking at it before this date”. So if I order something online that takes 2 weeks to deliver, I make a task for 2 weeks+3 days “did the order arrive? If yes: install the ordered item; else: contact vendor”. Make a filter to not see tasks you cant do anything about yet. \n\n* calendar usually has 0-3 things per day this way\n\n* task list is sorted by date. This is not an action list, but a list of possibilities. You are filtering such that tasks not ready for action are hidden (tomorrow onwards), and you are seeing tasks for today, or earlier.  \n\n* If your app says “due date”, relabel in your mind: “task available for action from date”. If it says “overdue”, relabel to “could have started as early as that date”. Don’t let the incorrect label give you guilt as if you are late. \n\n* No reminders except extreme cases or things i put on calendar many months in advance, like “birthday gift for spouse”.   \n\n\nEVERY MORNING\n\n* Look at calendar\n\n* Choose tasks for today:\n\n* Tasks that opened for possible-action-today-onwards will automatically appear based on the filter i mentioned, so: consider those + any tasks already open for a while. When you are done selecting, you should only have enough tasks that you can for-sure do today. Don’t flood yourself into guilt for not doing what you unrealistically assigned to yourself.\n\n* Tasks not selected for today should have some other date. Past date if you want to notice them again every time you’ve completed your tasks or start a new day, or:  \n\n* Tasks that have been open a long time and not done yet: consider deleting (“on second thought, I’ll never really do this talk”) / kicking the date a few weeks to the future to reconsider another time / put into “future” list of ideas that really aren’t important or urgent enough to keep considering-but-not-doing. ie reduce noise. \n\n* Preferably, designate a rough context/timing in each task selected for today, in task name or use categories or at least in your head. Eg selected task is “listen to audio summary of article for uni class ABC101”, and today I have an hour on the train, then I’ll set that as a task to do on the train. \n\nThat’s all.

But why make your plan more complicated than your task?\n\nEtc\nEtc\nEtc\n\nEdit: Storytime. I remember a teacher completely changing a kid's life when I was in 8th grade. This kid was incredibly disorganized and just falling apart. The teacher gave them a pad of sticky notes and made a deal where he'd cut them slack and let them turn in all their late assignments and make up homework (they were going to fail) on the condition this kid would always carry this stack of sticky notes and something to write with. The teacher would do surprise spot checks randomly to see if the kid has this pad and pen.to summarize, for the rest of the semester this kid had this pad and just a pile of papers scrunched in his pocket but it started to turn him around, it didn't matter that it was chaos, it was captured and that's what he needed.\nI know he is some kind of Projext Manager / Foreman for commercial building projects now... Organizing while teams... \n\nKeep it simple stupid - your productivity doesn't need to look like anyone else's (especially influencers and Creators in this space) system. \n\nEdit: Every once in a while 'break' your system. Find out what *really* helps you and what's merely superfluous. Stop using half your labels for a week or two and see if they're actually doing anything. Hide a couple of information columns in notion or obsidian or whatever and see whether or not those labels and scores and links and sources are actually doing anything for you or not. \n\nOutside of the Digital Realm? TRAIN your brain to adopt the 2 minute rule. You have to TRAIN and PRACTICE this one.  It's like therapy, just because you hear a good idea doesn't mean you're going to use it... It takes weeks/months and years of conscious rewiring but hammering home the 2 minute rule will be one of the best changes in your life.",

It’s not a typical to-do list app. Instead, it turns daily tasks and self-care into a gentle kind of “care game.”\n\nWhen I complete small goals waking up on time, drinking water, exercising, or doing focused work I earn coins to take care of a virtual cat by buying food, clothes, and furniture. As I keep showing up, the cat grows too.\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, the sense of companionship and visible progress makes me want to stay consistent, without the pressure that traditional productivity tools often create.\n\n\n\nI’m curious what methods, systems, or habits help you get through your day in a more organized way?",

End of day → scroll until sleep. It felt like I was busy, but nothing was actually holding my day together.\n\nWhat you said about gentle structure matters. The problem for me was never discipline, it was pressure. Every productivity app made me feel like I was failing before I even started. So I’d avoid them… and go back to my phone.\n\nThe idea of tying habits to something small and kind (like taking care of a cat) actually makes sense. It’s weird how our brains respond better to care than to guilt. Progress feels visible, but not threatening.\n\nI don’t have a perfect system either. What helped me a bit was anchoring my day to non-negotiables instead of goals. Wake up time. One walk. One focused block. Everything else is optional. Once those are done, the day feels less slippery.\n\nStill figuring it out honestly. But anything that replaces scrolling as the default rhythm is a win in my book.",

      "text": "Over the years I’ve tried a lot of productivity systems. Some I've even posted on Reddit and got good feedback. Others went nowhere. I’ve done tags. Priorities. Ridiculously complex filters. Advanced filters stacked on advanced filters. I once had a Todoist filter so long it hit the character limit.\n\nMost of them worked in theory. In practice they didn’t make me do more work. They just gave me more work to manage the system itself.\n\nI think I finally worked out why. Complicated systems made me feel clever. And feeling clever is weirdly satisfying. It scratches an itch. But it doesn’t move the needle. It just burns time.\n\nSo I’ve landed on a setup that’s almost boring in how simple it is. Thought I’d share it in case it helps someone else.\n\nHere’s the setup.\n\nI use Todoist.\n\nEverything goes into the inbox first. No thinking. Type it, hit enter, move on. I don’t organise at capture time. That’s the whole point of an inbox.\n\nLater, tasks can get moved into projects. Projects are just buckets for context. Work. Personal. Admin. Whatever. I’ve got maybe five or six. I don’t overthink it.\n\nI use dates as start dates, not deadlines. If I can’t or don’t want to see something until later, I give it a date. That date just tells Todoist “hide this until later”. It disappears. Future me can deal with it.\n\nI’m on the paid tier, so I use deadlines for actual hard deadlines. This is key. Deadlines are sacred. Very few tasks get one. Maybe half a dozen at any time. Most things just need to be done “soon-ish”, not “by 3pm Thursday”.\n\nDay to day, I live in exactly two places. That’s it.\n\nOne is the Today view. That’s stuff I’ve committed working on by giving it a date.\n\nThe other is one custom filter. This is my “Menu” of tasks.\n\n`No Date & !#Shopping & !assigned to: others & !/Someday`\n\nIt shows tasks I could do. It hides shopping, things assigned to other people, and anything parked in a /Someday section. Someday is just a hiding place for ideas I’m not actually acting on.\n\nHere’s the important bit. That filter is sorted by date added. Oldest at the top. No grouping. No priorities. No cleverness. Just a long list of things, oldest to newest, just like it would be if you wrote your to do list on a notepad.\n\nThat’s the whole system.\n\nNow how I actually use it.\n\nI don’t aggressively plan. I don’t time block. I don’t run prioritisation algorithms in my head. I’ve tried. It didn’t work.\n\nI open Todoist. I glance at Today to see what I’ve already committed to. Then I look at The Menu.\n\nAnd I start working.\n\nIf you’re wondering “but how do you choose what to pick from The Menu?”, there are only two rules.\n\nOption one: pick something near the top of The Menu and start. By definition it’s old. Which usually means it’s something you’ve been avoiding. Do it. You’ll feel better instantly.\n\nOption two: scroll down a bit and pick something you know matters. The thing someone’s waiting on. The thing that actually gets you closer to your goals. Don’t pretend (like I did for too long) that you need a system to tell you what's important and what's a waste of time. \n\nPick one. Work.\n\nWhy this works for me is mostly psychological.\n\nI only have two places to look. That alone massively reduces mental load. I used to have systems where I’d check multiple views, run a daily planning ritual, reshuffle priorities, feel very productive… and then realise I’d spent 30 minutes rearranging tasks instead of, you know, doing work.\n\nClearing old tasks is strangely cathartic. They’re the shit you’ve been dodging. Knocking a few off early feels fantastic.\n\nThere’s also no fake precision. I’ve stopped pretending I can rank every task by urgency, energy, context, location, priority, due date, moon phase, etc. Apps that claim to do this automatically sound amazing and mostly don’t work as advertised (I've tried them, looking at your Motion).\n\nIt’s less system. There’s almost nothing to think about. This post sounds long, but the actual behaviour is absurdly simple: capture everything, then work on it.\n\nThe biggest effect for me is that it calmed me down. I don’t spin on “what should I be doing right now?”. I just open Todoist and start.\n\nThis won’t be for everyone. But if you’re someone who keeps optimising your productivity system instead of your output, simplicity might be the upgrade you’re avoiding.",

I might feel guilty about an old task or anxious about a vague commitment, but the AI does not. It helps me do a fast priority audit, identify quick wins, flag things that should probably be deleted, and suggest a sane starting point. That alone drops my cognitive load way down.\n\nFrom there, the reset becomes manageable. I usually take one solid block of time, maybe an hour, to clean up based on that output instead of burning an entire day spiraling.

          "text": "I just did a deep dive on the question \"how long does it take to form a habit\". To keep it simple, with **consistent effort**, it takes on average **66 days** to form a habit. However this can be dramatically different depending on the difficulty of the habit you're trying to form.\n\nYou have exactly the right question, which is putting the emphasis on re-wiring the brain. Habits are **neurological**, so you have to train your nervous system. It's the same system you would need to learn a new language or an instrument. It takes time, practice, and dedication to see results.\n\nSomething like drinking 2 liters of water a day may only take 2-3 weeks to make a habit. Going to the gym 3 times a week may take 2-3 months. Studying two hours a day, everyday, may take 4-6 months.\n\nIn the early stages, when you're building the habit, you'll feel it. It takes effort, even if it doesn't feel like much, and it may be very uncomfortable. It's part of the process, but remember that you have to **remember to show up**. When it's in your nervous system (i.e. your brain is rewired), it becomes **nearly automatic**. It's no longer difficult. It's not even easy. It just becomes part of your routine. You'll know you got to this point because you'll feel uncomfortable **not** going to the gym or studying.\n\nThe most important part of this process is **staying motivated**. Start small and rack up little wins daily. For example, if you're starting a gym program, start with short programs with lighter weight. This will not only get you moving, it will mitigate injury in the process. 20-30 minutes just being in the gym, pumping 5 pound weights will give you the confidence to say to yourself, \"**I can do this**.\" Build from there. Don't be afraid to **half ass it**. If you can't do the whole, do a quarter, even a tenth. The name of the game is **keep showing up**. Don't beat yourself up or punish yourself for needing a break or not doing the whole program. You can rest, but **don't quit**. It will help if you document your progress and keep [SMART goals](https://www.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/IC-SMART-Goals-Worksheet-9237-PDF.pdf).\n\nTrust and believe in the process and yourself, go easy on yourself, stay determined, and you'll outpace 99% of those around you. Best of luck, fellow internet stranger. I really hope you find your stride.",

I've always struggled with knowing what exactly to work on because I value my time and I hate doing low leverage tedious task but I have no problem working 10 to 12 hour days if I know what I'm working on is going to pay off.\n\nSo I create clarity over a 12 hour. It may sound stupid, but it's not. I make my daily checklist the night before then I get up. I run through my daily checklist and I ranked them in priority as I start ranking them in priority other things my mind start turning up on what I should really be working on. It gets me thinking outside the box on what will move the needle, the furthest by forcing yourself to think every day in a ranking position of what is my highest leverage option here.\n\nIt honestly gave me loads of clarity and simplified my workday. I get more done in my five hour workday that I do now compared to my old eight or nine hour workday just because I have clarity on what to actually spend my time doing.",

I went back to a Google sheet with a Gary Keller's, 1-3-5 or as he calls it GPS, (Goal, Priority and Strategies).

          "text": "I use a couple different methods. One method is my journal. It’s really an everything journal, which started out as a bullet journal, and then I just write everything in it, but because I put it in a binder and my binder fills up, I am forced to remove the pages and put them on a shelf finder. So I decided that I would do that once a month, and when I do that, I review all the pages. So when I brain dump my ideas and thoughts into my journal, no matter how scattered they are, when I go through my monthly review, I will catch them and check them, and if it is a thought that I want to carry over, I will write it down on my review page.\n\nMy other way of organizing my thoughts is using ChatGPT. I utilize this most often at the end of the day, before bed. I will dictate into a chat, whatever is on my mind, kind of like journaling, and I just dump all my thoughts, including ideas. And then when I read back the response, it generates new thoughts and ideas in my head, it’s almost like a brainstorming session with myself. I then keep those thoughts into different chats, which I organize in projects in ChatGPT. And then I might name the chat something to keep track of it. Sometimes I will tell the chat to remind me later about it and it will a week later. Send me an email about the idea if it is something I want to do later.\n\nOther ways include the Notes app in my phone. Sometimes I just think of an idea, and then I open up the Notes app in my phone and dictate into it. It’s similar to ChatGPT, but there’s no feedback. I use that less now than I used to, because I find getting the feedback from ChatGPT to be more beneficial. What’s nice about the Notes app though is you can organize it into folders and you can use hashtags and other ways to track and organize the ideas and thoughts.\n\nA final idea I’ve never used but have been wanting to try is Zettelkasten. it involves 3 x 5 cards that you can organize in different boxes or drawers. It is an established method and it seems to really work.",

After doing quite a bit of digging and research, I realized that I was putting the same weight on tasks, actions, and goals that provide very little results compared to, and instead of putting much more weight on the 20% of actions and goals that vastly outperform in terms of results and outcome. So it's really a matter of prioritization. ",

And I still had plenty more left to review. At some point, I just have to step away from the email and move onto other things. Otherwise, I will get nothing done. \n\nI often wonder how people actually manage to stay on top of their email and respond quickly and thoroughly to everything.
