      "text": "Everyone talks about quitting smoking or drinking or whatever, but screen time honestly feels way worse to me. It’s so normal now that nobody even questions it.\n\nJust endless scrolling through bad news, reels, tweets, notifications every few minutes, comparing your life to random people online, constant FOMO. It’s exhausting but somehow feels impossible to stop. You don’t even realize how much it messes with your focus, mood, relationships, everything.\n\nI’ve tried setting limits. I’ve tried uninstalling apps. I’ll stay off for a few days, maybe a week if I’m lucky, and then suddenly I’m back to scrolling like nothing changed. No decision, just autopilot.\n\nThe worst part is people don’t take it seriously. If you say your screen time is out of control or that you’re stuck on your phone, people laugh it off or say “same.” But this actually feels like a real problem, just quieter and completely normalized.\n\nAnyone else feel this way?\n\nDo you even try to control it, or have you just accepted it at this point?\n\nWould genuinely like to hear how other people deal with this, or if anyone else feels equally stuck.",

First, I changed to a SIM-only plan with just the amount of data I would need. Then, I have started getting myself into a lot of physical activities without my phone. In the morning, I go for a long walk without my phone, just got into the hang of enjoying the nature's real beauty. Evening, I play a sport for a while and do some workout. \n\nAnd after getting back home, I literally spend time with my family. Sometimes, we don't know what to speak to a life partner after years of marriage. But, I met a couple who will take their cup of coffee and sit outside their balcony for some time every day and just talk about random things and build conversations with that. For example, just saying 'that house has a beautiful structure'. From there the conversations begin and go for sometime. And yes, it is interesting. \n\nNow, it has started feeling like a lot of no screen time is coming my way!",

The autopilot always found a way back.

PC is set up with Cold Turkey to block all social media from 6am to 3pm everyday, and when I journal and set goals/reflect on my day it's much easier to stick to good habits.

      "text": "I,'ve spent the last few years stuck in a cycle of \"morning rot.\" I’d be awake, but I would just lie there. My mind would be racing with guilt about my freelance work or the Excel skills I needed to learn, but I felt physically hijacked by old patterns.\n​I finally realized that the more I messed with my mind (criticizing myself, feeling guilty), the more I got stuck. As Sadhguru says, \"The mind is a survival tool, not a liberation tool.\" My mind was just doing its job staying in the \"safe\" loop of the bed.\n\n​I stopped fighting the effect (my thoughts) and started working on the cause: my nervous system. Here is the 2-minute \"Somatic Loop\" I use to actually get to my desk:\n\n​The Toe-to-Head Tension: While still under the covers, I tense my toes for 5 seconds, then release. I work my way up through my calves, thighs, stomach, and face. It manually signals to the body that the \"sleep loop\" is over. It’s like a jump-start for your energy (Prana).\n\n​Sensory Closure: Once I stand up, I immediately splash cold water on my face, feet, and arms. This sensory input tells my brain the \"Lazy Phase\" is officially finished.\n\n​The \"Unfolding\" Goal: I don't think about my freelance projects yet. I just tell myself to unfold my yoga mat. Once that mat is open, my body recognizes the \"Active Loop.\" Taking that one tiny physical initiative makes the rest of the day follow naturally.\n\n​Life is a phenomenon, not a thing to be fixed. Stop criticizing yourself for being \"unproductive.\" You aren't lazy; you’re just stuck in a survival loop. Take responsibility for your physical energy first, and the focus will follow.",

Thus, finding the ways to rewire your brain and create different associations with it, to prepare it to transition to the next chapter of that day step by step can be very beneficial.

You know the cycle: download a complex new tool, spend 3 days setting it up, and then abandon it a week later.\n\nThis year, I purged everything that added friction. These are the ones that survived because they actually simplify my life rather than complicating it.\n\n1. **Willow Voice:** I talk faster than I type. This works in any text field to draft emails or Slack messages, cleaning up the \"\"umms\"\" automatically.\n2. **Todoist:** I tried Notion for tasks, but it was too much clicking. Todoist’s natural language input (\"\"Buy milk tomorrow at 5pm\"\") is unbeatable.\n3. **Forest:** If I touch my phone, my tree dies. It sounds silly, but the gamification actually stops me from doom-scrolling.\n4. **Readwise:** It syncs all my Kindle highlights to one place. Essential for actually remembering what I read.\n5. **Cold Turkey:** When I really need to focus, this is the only blocker I can’t easily bypass.\n6. **Loom:** I stopped typing out 5-paragraph explanations to colleagues. I just record a 30-second video.\n7. **TextExpander:** I have snippets for my email address, Zoom link, and common replies. Saves me thousands of keystrokes a week.\n\nWhat’s the one tool you *actually* use every single day?\"",

And I learnt this from a Youtuber called HealthyGamer. \n\n**Step 1: Every morning, I start by listing out my tasks.** \n\nTasks should contain, Description so I understand what I have to do, the Outcomes of the task, and Deadline. \n\nI make sure I have at least 3-5 tasks per day. The task needs to be specific.  \nExample:   \nStudy for SAT exam **- Is not specific enough**  \nStudy Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - **is Specific enough for me.** \n\n**Step 2: Know the Outcomes.** \n\nThe outcomes need to be specific too!\n\nTask: Study Fundamental Theorem of Calculus  \nOutcomes: 1. Understand how differentiation and integration are connected  \n2. Understand how to solve area and accumulation problems easily.  \n\n\nClear outcomes define the success criteria of your task.\n\n**Step 3: Perform task for 2 mins**\n\nI clearly know that learning FTC will take me a few hours. But I do it for 2 mins. I don't stop at 2 mins, but i tell myself, all you need to do is perform this task for 2 mins. I convince myself that i can do this in 2 mins and start. But I always forget that i had a 2 minute timer and work on it without having to stop. If i do hit a wall, I tell myself, I will try for 2 mins, If it work it works, but always end up finishing the task. \n\n**Step 4: Finish the 3-5 tasks every single day.**\n\nMost tasks which we think will take hours can be completed in under 2 mins. Think about it, for you to have a productive day all you need to do is finish 5 tasks which generally task 2 mins. 10 mins of effort is all you need to keep moving forward! You can still keep scrolling for hours, but you just need to finish 5 tasks, gain the 5 outcomes before you do it. \n\n  \nThis is what I try to do every day. And it has helped me immensely. Heck, the reason I am typing about this is because i had it as a task. It took me 10 mins to type this, but I told myself it'll only take 2.",

PDFs I swore I'd read \"*later*.\" Voice memos with ideas that are probably just me mumbling.\n\nLast week I spent 20 minutes trying to find an article I KNEW I'd saved about habit formation. Couldn't find it. Gave up. Googled it. Found a different article.\n\nSaved that one too.\n\nThat's when it hit me. I'm not building a \"personal knowledge base.\" I'm hoarding. The act of saving something gives me a little dopamine hit like I accomplished something. But I never actually DO anything with it.\n\nSaving feels like learning without the actual work of learning.\n\nI tried forcing myself to write one sentence about WHY I'm saving something before I hit the button. It helped. I save way less now. But I still have this massive graveyard of \"I'll get to it eventually\" content sitting there.\n\nI'm curious, who else have this problem of endlessly collecting but never using what they save? Has anything actually worked for you? I tried looked for apps/software to help but couldn't find any :( \n\nAny advice?",

My evernote account was constantly being hacked or attempted log ins.  So I stopped using it. But really it was the closest thing to keeping things organized.

Not sure which exact video it was exactly, but the system stuck.\n\nHow it works\n\n\\-One main dashboard sheet The full year is broken down into months and grouped into Q1 Q2 and so on. Next to it there’s a key with two columns. one for color and one for the main task or category that color represents. You fill each day on the yearly calendar with colors based on what you worked on. This makes it easy to see what you spent most of the year doing and whether it was actually worth it.\n\n\\-Monthly sheets There are 12 separate sheets, one for each month. Each day has around 5 empty rows where you write that day’s to do list. Tasks can be moved around easily and color coded.\n\n\\-Simple feedback system If a task that absolutely needed to be done that day wasn’t completed, you mark it red. If you complete a task, you mark it green. By the end of the month you can clearly see how much red vs green there is and assess whether you actually did what you said you would or just stayed busy.",

Look, it can get wrong sometimes. You may get too attached to it, as you're mentioning right now, and I can understand that. But the solution to this is very simple. Whenever you have a thought or any topic to talk about with ChatGPT, just write that down instantly somewhere in a note app. Don't instantly open ChatGPT itself, and make a time window for when you'll open it, like when you have your main work done so it doesn't distract you. So at that time, you'll just ask exactly what you noted. \n\nNo judgment, but to really reduce this addiction, try walking more. Yes, I know, not joking. Try sitting with your own thoughts in silence. Walk and understand yourself, observe your thoughts, make time for this to do daily. Over time, you'll see yourself approaching ChatGPT less, and you'll be much more calm and grounded. Thanks for sharing it, friend. I've been through this as well, but it got reduced over time as I started opening it less and using the techniques I just shared. So try them, it might work out. Peace.",

      "text": "TL;DR- meditation helped me realise what living in the moment means.\n\nI was really fed up with my procrastination and overthinking problems. Whenever I tried to study or sit down to do my work, I would just start procrastinating. I would end up watching reels or thinking about random stuff. Other times, while just sitting there, I would go completely blank and get consumed in my thoughts.\n\nThese problems were making it really difficult for me to do anything. I was constantly stuck in a position where I wanted to work hard and focus on my studies, but because of all this overthinking about the future, what will happen, whether I will get a job or not, it kept hampering my studies.\n\nThis kept going on until I realized something. Around that time, I started meditating to improve my focus and to get some distance from my thoughts. And honestly, it turned out to be a wonderful decision.\n\nIt’s been six months now, and one of the most beautiful realizations that helped me overcome my overthinking and procrastination was this. All we really have is this moment. There is no past or future in the way we imagine it. What we call the future is something we only ever experience as the present. We never actually experience the future as future. All thoughts about it stay in our head. Experientially, we can only live in the present.\n\nThis realization might sound simple. I had heard it so many times before, live in the moment, focus on the present, but I could never really digest it. I just wasn’t able to grasp it. I’ve also heard this from Sadhguru, that “In reality, there is only now. If you know how to handle this moment, you know how to handle eternity.” But earlier, it stayed as just a quote for me.\n\nMeditation did something different. It was like it planted this understanding inside me. After meditating, this was no longer just a thought. It became real for me. It became a realization.\nAnd naturally, I was able to focus on what was in front of me. I stopped constantly thinking about what would happen in the future. I just knew that all I can do is work now. That’s what is in my hands. What I cannot do, I anyway won’t be able to do. But what I can do, I don’t want to miss it. So I'll do whatever I can.\n\nThis helped me a lot. Just felt like sharing this.\n\nThank you for reading.",

Meditation sounds like it really helped you turn that understanding into a real experience, not just a quote and that’s so inspiring. Definitely going to try focusing more on the present moment like you described. Thanks again for sharing your journey!”",

I like how you described the shift from knowing the idea of living in the present to actually experiencing it. That is a big difference. Meditation seems to create that small gap between you and your thoughts, where you can choose to just do what is in front of you instead of fighting your mind. Focusing on what you can do right now, and letting go of what you cannot control yet, sounds like a much healthier way to approach productivity. Thanks for sharing this so honestly.",

Of course there's the house chores and taking care of a toddler which consumes some of my time. Everything feels so hard though. Even making food, I can barely manage to cook a meal before 12pm. But I want to be more productive. I really want to have a good routine where we eat breakfast, spend at least 1hr outside, \"homeschool\" my kid by teaching him numbers, letters, etc, read books and have some physical activity multiple times a week. I'd like to start going to yoga or ballet classes again. I'd like to go see my friends more often. I'd like to finish creative projects. I'd even like to continue studies.\n\nI just feel like I'm soooo demotivated and even if I try to force myself to do these things I just can't find the motivation. I know ideally I'd need discipline instead of motivation but how do I create that? Worth mentioning is that I'm severely mentally ill currently, I got a food poisoning a year ago that triggered severe emetophobia that gives me 24/7 debilitating anxiety and frequent panic attacks, I am seeking help for it as quickly as I can, as quickly as the healthcare is giving me appointments basically. It has caused me to become very underweight, barely eat, barely have energy and also be very scared of doing normal things like going outside the house. But I'm really working on that cos fuck living like this, I want to get better.\n\nAre there any other SAHM's who have gotten out of a slump and gotten themselves more more productive and motivated?  \n",

          "text": "First give yourself grace! \n\nThe phone is the problem. Been there…multiple times….it just sucks you in. Video games too….time just passes by so quickly… In am turn on radio (we have old fashion cheap atenna one or I use my radio app on phone)…I find that if I avoid going on my phone in am and just say okay going to do dishwasher then after that I get little motivated then I see something else and move on etc. every time you complete something even the smallest you get a dopamine rush which in turn is motivation to go for that feeling. Example…Do laundry for 5 minutes…I grab a couple items and then say I’m going to move on after those things and before I know it I’m done with it all. It’s like I have to trick my mind into wanting to do things at first to get myself going (and for some reason my brain doesn’t recall what I have up my sleeve). I think for me it’s because I have insomnia and get like 5 hours sleep a night that I have days of low motivation. I find when I prioritize sleep and go to bed and get at least 6 hours that I feel more motivated and energized next day. I also have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and feel that affect my energy levels daily. Lastly if doomscrolling on facebook and comparing how you are to what people want you to see of them it’s a horrible cycle. I find when I take a break from social media that my brain resets and I feel more recharged and refreshed. (I was able to go a year without it only because I couldn’t recall password after switching phones.)\n\nI also understand the food thing a bit. Due to my thyroid I had to go without gluten and soy and my son has milk allergy so it’s challenging to satisfy everyone. I used to find meals sooo easy growing up cooking for family of 9 and now for the 4 of us it’s so exhausting and totally opposite of motivation.  Good that you are seeking help for what you are going through. I deal with anxiety too and I find that in the intense moments that deep breaths and focusing on something positive best I can. \n\nGoing out whether it’s grocery, Costco, Walmart (hard one for some reason) and school events (big one) for me I find that I have to talk myself into just going out because i find once I do I feel so energized because of the endorphins received from conquering that moment. It gets easier each time. (I have social anxiety and feel the world much more intensely than others around me. My son is the same way. My other son is like his dad and just goes with flow.)\n\nI find prayer in the morning and multiple times per day and just saying I can’t do this without You and asking for energy and strength and help with what I’m dealing with in the moment especially. It’s like saying I can’t do this on my own and the weight is lifted a bit. \n\nHopefully this helps a bit…you’re not alone! I also have found that my hormones out of whack after kids had something to do with it. I go to functional dr that prescribes me made for me cream based hormones. I get tested every 6 months sometimes 4 months until balances. I’m low on progesterone (had to take before I was able to get pregnant and during) and low on testosterone. Being on very low dose of testosterone this last year my motivation, libido, energy, anxiety all got better. So maybe your hormones could be out of whack as well…something to look into. Make sure you go to functional Dr for this and not just taking something that someone else can take as it’s not one size fits all. Look up symptoms of low testosterone, progesterone etc. see if it might be worth looking into. If your hormones are low, it can cause soooo many issues with entire body system. \n\nWith exercise find something that you used to love. For me it was Billy Blanks Tae Bo from high school. I found on YouTube and was able to get back into it…until I broke my wrist rollerblading.  I told myself I’ll just do short video like 10 minute and then eventually I would do another and then longer videos. I could do right in living room with the kids (watch those kicks! My son learned the hard way lol) or while they napped. \n\nEverything is hard at first but after your brain expects it to happen at certain time of day or even just happen in your day then it gets easier. For me I exercised in am before showering because if I showered I would end up working out at like 10pm because I would keep putting off. \n\nBest of luck and many blessings to your journey ahead.",

Even doing this will release \"feel good\" endorphins in your brain that will make you less guilty about being on the phone the rest of the time.\n\nGradually increase work on that skill to 45 minutes, then an hour and so on.

When I stopped using my phone upon waking I noticed my productivity skyrocket. I go on my laptop when I have my morning coffee for a quick IG + Reddit scroll and oftentimes I don’t even touch my phone till noon (minus my wake up alarm).

My parents do it. My grandma does it. I do, and so does my nephew and little brother. Everyone.\n\nHonestly my advice is simple.\nYou already know how much your phone is taking away from your life. That's an amazing start.\n\nThe fix is to build better systems. It'll take some time, but it is incredibly simple. Just requires being conscientious. You need to know what's happening, go places, and make rules.\n\nThere are 3 core techniques required:\n- Awareness: We all have certain triggers which ruin our days.\nLike maybe scrolling in bed. A late start to the day. Getting distracted by our phones instead of cooking food. Things like that. Make a note of every single one of these.\n\n- \"if-then\" method. You need rules. This is the \"logic\" of your new system. If this happens, then this happens. What you need to do is edit your logic.\n\"If I think of starting yoga again, then I will sign up for a yoga class within the week.\" Follow that new rule. \n\"If I start scrolling on my phone before bed. Then I will put my phone in the drawer.\" Follow that new rule.\nSome habits need more rules.\n\"If I still can't sleep after placing my phone in the drawer, then I will meditate.\" \"If meditation doesn't put me to sleep, I will just ruminate all night.\"\nSometimes your rules won't work. Be aware of this, and add more logic and rules. This is how you build a core system.\n- \"butt in chair\" method. Your environment determines what you do the most.\nIf you are still in bed, all you can do is sleep, or scroll on your phone.\nEven if you are tied to your phone, get out of bed, and go to where your next task is.\nPhysically move on with your day. Naturally, many people will put their phone down. And start doing the next task. Some don't.\nThat's why you also need to also employ rules. Such as, \"no phone use while walking\". These simple rules can break how stuck you are.\n\nAs your habits develop, more and more of the problem will go away. Phone use is a pervasive problem. To fix it you need a pervasive solution, that breaks the habit everywhere.\n\nTldr; You need to develop systems. It's complicated. Because life is complicated. Having more rules and following them makes it easier. Just keep adding more rules. Physically move on with your day. You'll get more things done.",

Then do literally anything. Eat a snack, play with your kid’s toys, draw a picture, stretch, do a tiny bit of cleaning (like put the dishes in the dishwasher, or vacuum one room), take a nap. Really doesn’t matter what you’re doing, it’ll still help you train your brain to not rely on your devices, which in turn can help with anxiety and depression, sleep schedules, and other things. Maybe start with 20 minutes of purposeful no devices time (but also don’t have it in your pocket). You’ll find that when your brain isn’t distracted it might get a little bored and then chores and other productive (but not super fun) things seem more interesting",

You obviously didn't mention ADHD, but the sense of paralysis resonated with me.\n\nWrite a to do list on a whiteboard/paper (not phone, physical is more satisfying). But make sure to include everything you already KNOW you'll do, like feed and bathe your child, and make sure to tick those off. Just because they're the 'default' tasks doesn't mean they're not an achievement. Also put on some things that are extremely easy and accessible, like opening the windows for a few hours, or filling a huge jug of water, then tick off the box if you drink it all. \n\nNext try and find someone who can visit you easily, a neighbour or friend, who would be happy to do a short walk around the neighbourhood regularly, at the start of the day. When you come home you'll feel like you've already done a big useful task, your kid will be happier, you'll be more clear headed. Don't push yourself to walk longer than you're comfortable with, the routine is important and also the fact that someone else is involved, especially if they turn up at your door and there's no organising needed. \n\nSee if you can batch cook with your spouse together, put music on to make it a nicer activity. Boiling loads of eggs at once and putting them in the fridge for example, or pre-chopping veg and putting them in freezer bags. When you order food, focus on easy foods to grab, like bananas. (Edited to add here, I just noticed your issues with food in your post. For now, I'd say throw the idea of 'healthy' out the window if it means you can just focus on getting calories. If that means that custard and crackers are the only things you feel safe eating, eat that custard and crackers till the cows come home, and worry about adding nutrients once you have more strength. Personal experience)\n\nTry and see a doctor if you can. It could be something very important physically that might get overlooked as 'anxiety' or 'postnatal depression', like it might turn out you're low on iron. \n\nTry the app Bearable. It helps you track symptoms, energy, and mood in relation to factors in your life, like sleep, what you ate, what tasks you did, and it's very customisable and cheap. It made me realise the things that consistently make me have a good day are reading a good book and eating enough protein. You can look back on the past and see patterns, too. And you can add to your to-do list 'complete Bearable entry for today', along with that walk if you did one.\n\nOther people have great advice and points, but I wanted to add these",

It's a lot easier to slowly build up habits over years than to try to make a bunch of huge changes at once.\n* Go easy on myself. If I feel like I screwed up (by doing too much organizing and burning out, by not getting enough done etc.) I just don't let it bother me. It has never helped me to beat myself up over anything.\n* Set time limits. If you want to completely overhaul something and it will take many hours, just spend 15 minutes on it every day or two instead of using your entire day to knock it out. Really this is about prioritizing. If your work is the most important part of your day, don't spend your entire day organizing things. Spend a bit of it organizing things and the rest working.\n* Pay attention to my energy levels and learn to rest. I also have ADHD so it is important to manage my stimulant dosage on top of my focus and my sleep. And I have found there is little reason to try to force myself to get things done when I am burned out. It's better to rest to get more done later.\n* Meditation has been the most important habit for me. It helps you to see exactly how your mind works, which lets you deal with these types of things with more wisdom.\n\nHope some of that helps!",

Don't let it sit in your inbox pretending to be work.\n\nThe busywork will always be there.

It’s not a typical to-do list app. Instead, it turns daily tasks and self-care into a gentle kind of “care game.”\n\nWhen I complete small goals waking up on time, drinking water, exercising, or doing focused work I earn coins to take care of a virtual cat by buying food, clothes, and furniture. As I keep showing up, the cat grows too.\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, the sense of companionship and visible progress makes me want to stay consistent, without the pressure that traditional productivity tools often create.\n\n\n\nI’m curious what methods, systems, or habits help you get through your day in a more organized way?",

The problem for me was never discipline, it was pressure. Every productivity app made me feel like I was failing before I even started. So I’d avoid them… and go back to my phone.\n\nThe idea of tying habits to something small and kind (like taking care of a cat) actually makes sense. It’s weird how our brains respond better to care than to guilt. Progress feels visible, but not threatening.\n\nI don’t have a perfect system either. What helped me a bit was anchoring my day to non-negotiables instead of goals. Wake up time. One walk. One focused block. Everything else is optional. Once those are done, the day feels less slippery.\n\nStill figuring it out honestly. But anything that replaces scrolling as the default rhythm is a win in my book.",

          "text": "I just did a deep dive on the question \"how long does it take to form a habit\". To keep it simple, with **consistent effort**, it takes on average **66 days** to form a habit. However this can be dramatically different depending on the difficulty of the habit you're trying to form.\n\nYou have exactly the right question, which is putting the emphasis on re-wiring the brain. Habits are **neurological**, so you have to train your nervous system. It's the same system you would need to learn a new language or an instrument. It takes time, practice, and dedication to see results.\n\nSomething like drinking 2 liters of water a day may only take 2-3 weeks to make a habit. Going to the gym 3 times a week may take 2-3 months. Studying two hours a day, everyday, may take 4-6 months.\n\nIn the early stages, when you're building the habit, you'll feel it. It takes effort, even if it doesn't feel like much, and it may be very uncomfortable. It's part of the process, but remember that you have to **remember to show up**. When it's in your nervous system (i.e. your brain is rewired), it becomes **nearly automatic**. It's no longer difficult. It's not even easy. It just becomes part of your routine. You'll know you got to this point because you'll feel uncomfortable **not** going to the gym or studying.\n\nThe most important part of this process is **staying motivated**. Start small and rack up little wins daily. For example, if you're starting a gym program, start with short programs with lighter weight. This will not only get you moving, it will mitigate injury in the process. 20-30 minutes just being in the gym, pumping 5 pound weights will give you the confidence to say to yourself, \"**I can do this**.\" Build from there. Don't be afraid to **half ass it**. If you can't do the whole, do a quarter, even a tenth. The name of the game is **keep showing up**. Don't beat yourself up or punish yourself for needing a break or not doing the whole program. You can rest, but **don't quit**. It will help if you document your progress and keep [SMART goals](https://www.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/IC-SMART-Goals-Worksheet-9237-PDF.pdf).\n\nTrust and believe in the process and yourself, go easy on yourself, stay determined, and you'll outpace 99% of those around you. Best of luck, fellow internet stranger. I really hope you find your stride.",

It's not about reaching half of what you used to do, it's about when will you be consistent again. In the beginning you might have a really good day and go back to slacking the next.

          "text": "I use a couple different methods. One method is my journal. It’s really an everything journal, which started out as a bullet journal, and then I just write everything in it, but because I put it in a binder and my binder fills up, I am forced to remove the pages and put them on a shelf finder. So I decided that I would do that once a month, and when I do that, I review all the pages. So when I brain dump my ideas and thoughts into my journal, no matter how scattered they are, when I go through my monthly review, I will catch them and check them, and if it is a thought that I want to carry over, I will write it down on my review page.\n\nMy other way of organizing my thoughts is using ChatGPT. I utilize this most often at the end of the day, before bed. I will dictate into a chat, whatever is on my mind, kind of like journaling, and I just dump all my thoughts, including ideas. And then when I read back the response, it generates new thoughts and ideas in my head, it’s almost like a brainstorming session with myself. I then keep those thoughts into different chats, which I organize in projects in ChatGPT. And then I might name the chat something to keep track of it. Sometimes I will tell the chat to remind me later about it and it will a week later. Send me an email about the idea if it is something I want to do later.\n\nOther ways include the Notes app in my phone. Sometimes I just think of an idea, and then I open up the Notes app in my phone and dictate into it. It’s similar to ChatGPT, but there’s no feedback. I use that less now than I used to, because I find getting the feedback from ChatGPT to be more beneficial. What’s nice about the Notes app though is you can organize it into folders and you can use hashtags and other ways to track and organize the ideas and thoughts.\n\nA final idea I’ve never used but have been wanting to try is Zettelkasten. it involves 3 x 5 cards that you can organize in different boxes or drawers. It is an established method and it seems to really work.",

I’ve had years of setbacks with my career and mental health. I’m finally doing an MSc in Computing while also doing a remote internship, but I still feel behind in life, no stable job, small social circle, no hobbies, and honestly just feeling stuck.\n\nThere’s a girl I’ve been following on social media for years. She’s from the same cultural and religious background as me, which already makes her feel “familiar.” But her lifestyle is the complete opposite of mine. She’s successful in tech, confident, travelling with friends, partying, wearing revealing clothes, always looking stunning, featured in online videos about IT, living a life that seems full of independence and freedom.\n\nI don’t know her. I’ve never spoken to her. But I end up obsessively checking her social media, sometimes even looking at her family members or friends just to see more photos of her. It feels creepy and unhealthy, and I hate that I’m doing it. It’s like I’m obsessed to this fantasy version of her life.\n\nMeanwhile, I’m struggling with my own identity and direction. Instead of focusing on myself, I’m scrolling through her life and feeling worse about my own. It’s messing with my confidence, making me feel like a failure, and I can’t seem to stop.\n\nI want to break out of this cycle. I want to stop checking her profiles and actually focus on getting my life together, my health, my career, my hobbies, anything. But the obsession keeps pulling me back, especially when I feel lonely or frustrated.\n\nHow do you stop obsessing over someone you don’t know?  \nAny advice would be appreciated.",

It doesn't mean anything- what matters is how you overcome them and how quickly you can do so.\n\nAt 32 years old, we're not young anymore, but there's still a bit of time.

Society's rule says to compare yourself to others to determine your own happiness, but that's bullsh\\*t! YOU make your own rules in life, stop following the bs rules that society has instilled in your brain! You are amazing, you just have to realize it.\n\nAnd you are still young. You don't need to find an identity, just be you, that IS your identity. If you have no passions, you need to get out and try new things. But don't think you have to find some special purpose in life, don't listen to the rules that society tells you to follow. Your purpose is to do what makes you happy!! Maybe that's video games, maybe it's exploring the outdoors, maybe it's volunteering, or doing art.\n\nTry new things, get out of your comfort zone and I guarantee you will feel alive, you'll learn, you'll meet people, you'll find passions, you'll gain confidence, and you'll not rely on others for happiness or put people on social media on a pedestal. Realize that putting yourself out there will not go perfectly, but you grow more from failures than successes, so embrace the process! Oh and delete the social media app from your phone!",

So I get out of bed to turn off the alarm and thinking to sleep again but once I reach the bathroom it’s easy for me to convince myself on washing my face and that just wakes me up. \n\nYou can try placing a motivational quote in the bathroom as well if reaching there won’t be enough for you.
