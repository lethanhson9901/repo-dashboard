              "text": "This is a tricky question because there are many different areas at the moment where AI might plausibly impact productivity. Let's go through a few...\n\nIn the world of computer programming, AI-supported tab-complete in code generation is clearly a time-saver. Vibe coding, by contrast, is more complicated. It produces working software faster than a human can do, so in that sense it increases productivity. But it's unclear to what degree vibe coded software will play a significant role in software development.\n\nWhen it comes to knowledge workers using chatbots, there are isolated use-cases where it clearly makes things more efficient (think: a journalist being able to accurately auto-transcribe an interview). But there are not as many such use cases yet as I would have expected. Using it to write emails or create slide show drafts is creating a lot of \"workslop\" that might be fast to produce but not actually that useful.\n\nAgents aren't ready for prime time yet outside the context of the terminal. They might never be. (I published an article about this for the New Yorker last month.)\n\nFor students, using chatbots to cheat -- e.g., produce answers for problem sets -- is clearly increasing productivity in some strict value-less sense of the word. Last year I wrote an article where I followed students using chatbots to help them write papers. Interestingly, the way they used them (which included lots of back-and-forth conversations) probably made it take longer to write the papers, but also made the experience feel less cogntively demanding.  i\n\n  \nTo me, the real productivity gains are yet to come. They will happen when people leave the chatbot interface and get custom tools, powered by RL-tuned LLMs, that are integrated into software tools where they do a small amount of automated efforts really well.",

I make a living thinking, so to have constant access to algorithmically-optimized distraction would be like a professional athlete smoking -- it would be counter-productive! \n\n  \nThe cons have been reducing with each passing year. For example, as these platforms increasingly follow a TikTok model of maximum engagement, most social interaction with friends and family has moved to chat, so I no longer miss out on that. (Just this morning, my brother was posting photos to our iMessage group about the ski trip he is on. A decade ago, he might have posted those on Facebook or Instagram instead.) I also think the rise of email newsletters and podcasts have made it easier to find interesting, independent voices on issues without having to rely on social platforms.\n\n  \nProbably the biggest con is that I could probably build a much larger audience if I was also very active on these alternative channels. But I like my audience! And I still sell books. So I'm fine with that...",

Leave it in your dorm to study. Go on a hike or walk without it. This helps break the mental loop in which boredom is always immediately rewarded with a digital diversion; (3) Aggressively seek out alternative activities and commitments with which to add meaning and diversion to your life. Make your analog life, in other words, so rich that the phone begins to pale by comparison.\n\n  \n(I'm actually writing a book now called THE DEEP LIFE, which seems oddly self-help-ey for someone like me who typically writes about taming technology. But I realized, at some point, that one of the most powerful things you can do to escape compulsive phone use is to make your life outside the screen more important and interesting to you.)",

Here it's helpful to use standard knowledge work productivity ideas. For example: \n\n \\- Time-block plan your day instead of being reactive  \n \\- Avoid collaboration through ad hoc messaging. If a message can't be answered in a single reply, then move the conversation to a phone call or person discussion.  \n \\- Implement processes to make work on recurring types of tasks more predictable and less interruptive.  \n \\- Implement full capture (never keep track of things only in your head).  \n \\- To ensure you're giving people reasonable time line expectations for the tasks you accept, try actually scheduling the time on your calendar, in advance, for when you'll complete the work you just accepted. This will help you quickly assess when you actually do have time to get things done.  \n  \\- protect time for actual work from meetings. This could mean having set hours protected every day, or you could practice the rule that everytime you schedule a meeting you have to schedule the same amount of time for deep work somewhere in that same week. \n\n  \nThe former skill (workload management) is about how you manage the number of things you agree to work on in the first place. This is a major focus of my book Slow Productivity. I think this is a new frontier in knowledge work productivity: turning our focusing from how to manage our work to how to manage what we allow to become our work.",

I'm friends with many of these authors. It's a good addition to the genre!\n\n  \nAll that being said, the basic principles of knowledge work productivity still apply: context switching reduces cognitive capacity, task overload is a scourge, and deep work is still the primary mechanism through which value is created.",

In SO GOOD, I call these the \"control traps.\" If you leave your current situation too early then you might not have enough career capital to succeed at something new. But when you do have enough capital is exactly when your employer won't want to lose you and will keep finding ways to keep you in their pipeline. \n\nA good test for leaving is whether or not people will give you money. That is, are customers buying your product, are other employers offering you a good salary? People will be quick to praise your plan, but they want offer you money unless what you're doing actually seems valuable.",

Sometimes I'll binge maker videos with my kids.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that fandoms are a great way to introduce more meaningful fallbacks when exhausted by life.

This helps to keep me focused only on those tasks I've actively chosen to do that day, without the rest of the list looming over me.",

      "text": "\"I’ve gone through the \"\"optimization rabbit hole\"\" more times than I care to admit. You know the cycle: download a complex new tool, spend 3 days setting it up, and then abandon it a week later.\n\nThis year, I purged everything that added friction. These are the ones that survived because they actually simplify my life rather than complicating it.\n\n1. **Willow Voice:** I talk faster than I type. This works in any text field to draft emails or Slack messages, cleaning up the \"\"umms\"\" automatically.\n2. **Todoist:** I tried Notion for tasks, but it was too much clicking. Todoist’s natural language input (\"\"Buy milk tomorrow at 5pm\"\") is unbeatable.\n3. **Forest:** If I touch my phone, my tree dies. It sounds silly, but the gamification actually stops me from doom-scrolling.\n4. **Readwise:** It syncs all my Kindle highlights to one place. Essential for actually remembering what I read.\n5. **Cold Turkey:** When I really need to focus, this is the only blocker I can’t easily bypass.\n6. **Loom:** I stopped typing out 5-paragraph explanations to colleagues. I just record a 30-second video.\n7. **TextExpander:** I have snippets for my email address, Zoom link, and common replies. Saves me thousands of keystrokes a week.\n\nWhat’s the one tool you *actually* use every single day?\"",

It’s already helping a lot because I can visually see where my time and energy are actually going.\n\nI got the idea from a Charlie Morgan productivity video on YouTube who credits Steve Ovens for it. Not sure which exact video it was exactly, but the system stuck.\n\nHow it works\n\n\\-One main dashboard sheet The full year is broken down into months and grouped into Q1 Q2 and so on. Next to it there’s a key with two columns. one for color and one for the main task or category that color represents. You fill each day on the yearly calendar with colors based on what you worked on. This makes it easy to see what you spent most of the year doing and whether it was actually worth it.\n\n\\-Monthly sheets There are 12 separate sheets, one for each month. Each day has around 5 empty rows where you write that day’s to do list. Tasks can be moved around easily and color coded.\n\n\\-Simple feedback system If a task that absolutely needed to be done that day wasn’t completed, you mark it red. If you complete a task, you mark it green. By the end of the month you can clearly see how much red vs green there is and assess whether you actually did what you said you would or just stayed busy.",

          "text": "Man, I really appreciate you sharing what worked for you, especially the walks and the app blocker, those are solid habits. But I have to push back on the 'instant noodles every couple of days' part.\n\nIf you're dealing with *severe* brain fog, those noodles might be doing more damage than you think. They are basically a giant bowl of refined carbs, sodium, and preservatives that spike your blood sugar and then leave you crashing. It’s hard to have mental clarity when your insulin is on a roller coaster (trust me I know!).\n\nInstead of just 'minimizing' junk, I’d look into how specialized nutrition can actually repair that fog. For example, some people have had incredible results using products from revgenetics. They focus on things like high-purity Resveratrol and NMN, which actually support mitochondrial health and cellular energy, but its not like an instant caffeine kick... nonono...  When your cells are actually firing correctly, the fog doesn't just 'clear', it stays away because you've addressed the biological root, not just the habits. But even that stuff wont work well if you are stuck with minimum nutrient deficiencies... I have to comeback to the instant noodles... they taste good, but holy cow they are a nutritional black hole... look, eat eggs, try them daily. I have been poor af, and at least they helped top me up where I needed it most. You may not have $$ for steak, so eat them eggs.\n\nThe 'external brain' and long walks are great for managing the noise, but don't underestimate how much better your brain will perform if you give it premium fuel and targeted supplements instead of just trying to 'survive' on processed stuff. Keep at it, though, the consistency is definitely the hardest part!",

I was always busy but never actually clear, just mentally noisy all the time.\n\nThe walking thing sounds stupid until you try it. Long walks with no phone, no music, no podcasts were the first time my brain actually slowed down enough to think properly. It felt less like motivation and more like untangling knots. I had the same experience where problems stopped feeling overwhelming and started feeling specific.\n\nThe app blocker part is also real. Paying for it weirdly makes you respect it more. Once certain apps are just not an option during parts of the day, your brain adapts instead of constantly negotiating with itself.\n\nWhat you said about lowering expectations is probably the most important bit. A lot of brain fog comes from constantly failing your own unrealistic standards. Once I focused on doing fewer things consistently instead of trying to fix everything at once, the fog started lifting on its own.\n\nIf anyone reading this feels stuck or behind, you are definitely not alone. I write about this kind of stuff in plain language because I was in that exact headspace for a long time too.",

Around mid-afternoon I noticed I was bouncing between tasks, checking things off, but not really finishing anything cleanly.\n\nNormally I’d respond by tightening up. Pomodoro timer, stricter list, less “wasted” time. Instead, I did the opposite. I left my desk, made coffee, and sat there for five minutes doing absolutely nothing. No phone, no planning, no optimizing.\n\nWhen I came back, I finished the next task faster than I expected. And the one after that. It wasn’t because I found some secret trick, it was because my brain had stopped resisting. I realized how much of my productivity problem comes from constantly trying to force output instead of letting focus reset naturally.\n\nI still plan my day and I still care about getting things done. I even keep money set aside from myprize so I don’t feel pressure to grind every minute just to feel secure. But I’ve started leaving intentional gaps instead of packing everything tight, and weirdly, more gets finished.\n\nI think I confused being busy with being effective for a long time. Turns out sometimes the most productive thing you can do is stop trying to be productive for a moment. Curious if anyone else noticed something similar once they loosened their grip a bit.",

Crossing things off feels good even if nothing meaningful is actually finished. Leaving small gaps in the day feels wrong at first, almost like you are slacking, but weirdly that’s when work starts flowing again.\n\nAlso relatable what you said about money and pressure. When there’s even a bit of financial breathing room, it is way easier to stop grinding every second just to feel safe. That constant background stress messes with focus more than people admit.\n\nCurious how many people here noticed the same thing once they stopped trying to optimise every minute. I write about this kind of stuff sometimes too, mostly because I spent years stuck in that loop.",

I started watching a series and noticed that I practically jump out of bed in the morning because I can't wait to watch the next episode. \n\nNow this level of obsession is the exact reason why I stopped watching series in general. Right now I am on a school break and let myself enjoy it.\n\nBut it made me realize how important it is to have something to look forward to in the morning is. And I am wondering if you guys have your own little routine. Is there something you are excited to do in the morning?\n\nIf not I highly recommend finding something haha it was so strange.

However, I only go to cafés that don't get packed during peak hours, and I typically buy more than just the initial food/snack/drink. I've never gone to a café to just sit down without ordering anything, that would feel incredibly weird.\n\nSo personally I feel like it's both crowd/order based; if the place is packed and you don't order anything, you're taking up a spot from someone who would. If you order, say, an initial tea and cradle it for 3 hours but you're literally the only customer, you aren't taking anything away from anyone. If you stay for something crazy like 8 hours but keep ordering, hey! Don't think anyone would complain.",

It’s not really about how long you’ve been there or how many drinks you’ve ordered, it’s about whether your presence is actually affecting anyone else.\n\nIf the cafe is quiet or half empty, nobody cares. You can sit there for hours on one coffee and you’re basically background noise. Staff usually do not mind because you are not stopping turnover and the space is not under pressure.\n\nOnce it starts filling up, that’s when it changes. If people are clearly looking for seats or you’ve got a laptop out during peak hours, that’s when staying too long starts to feel off. Not because you’re doing something wrong, but because space has become scarce.\n\nMy personal rule is just to read the room. Quiet cafe, stay as long as you want. Busy cafe, either order again or wrap things up soon. Chains are generally more tolerant than small independents too.\n\nMost of the awkwardness is just social awareness, not some hidden timer you’re breaking.\n\nI write a bit about working habits and productivity without overthinking everything.

My manager was a lot more patient with more affluent-looking people.\n\nAs just basic staff, we will be a lot more flexible with you if you’re polite to us. Honestly, too you can just ask! Find the chillest looking barista and just ask, “is it ok if I just set up my computer for a couple hours and get some work done?” Guaranteed they’ll either give you the exact policy info or be like “sure, dude whatever”.",

I also made sure to get a table of two when free so that I wasn’t taking up a big table alone. It also helps if you’re a regular there already and you’re nice to the staff. I would usually pack up and go to the library if it got so busy others couldn’t sit anymore.\n\nI would say every 1.5 should be the minimum you should order. Over here a lot of cafes give you 1 or 1.5 free work hours when you order a drink now and you have to pay if you want to work longer. Or they have a specific section where you can sit with a laptop and the rest of the cafe is laptop free.",

Ours was very accepting of people wanting to hang out. But those people generally made it a point to buy something, get refills, or at the very least chat with the staff and get to know us. This helps because we felt more comfortable about the person being there for so long, especially if it were around closing time. And! Starbucks has for-here glassware.

      "text": "ok so this started as a dumb experiment and turned into something that genuinely changed how my days feel.\n\nAbout a month ago I got frustrated because I kept running late in the mornings even though I swore my routine only took 45 minutes. Like, I KNEW it was 45 minutes. I’d done it a thousand times.\n\nSo I decided to actually time it. Every single step. For 30 days straight.\n\nDay 1 result: 1 hour 22 minutes.\n\nI was almost double what I thought. And honestly? That pissed me off enough to keep tracking.\n\nWhere the missing 37 minutes were hiding???\n\nThe biggest one was transition time. The gap between finishing one thing and actually starting the next. Like, I’d finish breakfast and then just… stand in the kitchen for a bit. Check my phone. Wander to the bathroom. Start getting dressed but realize I need to pick something out first.\n\nEach of those gaps was 3-7 minutes. Doesn’t sound like much but I had 6 of them in my morning. That’s 25-30 minutes of basically nothing.\n\nThe second thing was variance. Some tasks were super consistent — making coffee was always about 4 minutes, showering was always 10-12 minutes. But picking what to wear? Anywhere from 2 minutes to literally 18 minutes one day when I couldn’t find a clean shirt and then changed my mind twice.The high-variance stuff is what destroys your schedule. You can’t plan around something that takes anywhere from 2-18 minutes.\n\nThird thing: the “quick check” tax. Every morning I’d squeeze in like 4-5 “quick” things — check slack, reply to a text, look at the weather, scroll instagram for “one sec.” Each one was 2-3 minutes but I was doing it almost unconsciously. That’s another 10-15 minutes I never accounted for.\n\nWhat I actually changed:\n\nAfter seeing the data for a couple weeks, the fix was pretty obvious. I rebuilt my morning with honest times and a locked sequence:Wake up + stretch —5 min, Shower — 12 min,Get dressed (clothes picked the night before, this was the big one):3 mins,Breakfast, same thing every weekday, overnight oats — 8 min, look at my 3 priorities for today — 5 min,grab stuff and go — 7 min,Buffer because life happens — 5 min\n\nTotal: 45 minutes. But like, a REAL 45 minutes this time.\n\nI tried timing with my phone stopwatch for the first few days and it was annoying as hell. Tried Toggl but that felt too work-y for a morning routine. Tried a spreadsheet and lasted about 4 days before I stopped filling it in.\n\nWhat actually worked for me was a routine timer app — you set up the steps once and then just tap through them each morning. It shows you the full sequence as a visual timeline so you can see where you are and what’s coming. The thing that surprised me was having it on my Lock Screen. I just glance at my phone and see “step 4 of 7, 3 minutes left” without opening anything. It sounds small but it removed this constant “wait what am I supposed to do next” friction that I didn’t even realize I had. Not a magic wand I found to solve all my problems at once but definitely a significant jump wrt kind of solutions I found earlier.\n\nBiggest takeaway:\n\nWe are TERRIBLE at estimating how long our own routines take. Like embarrassingly bad. But once you have actual data, fixing the routine is almost easy. The problem was never motivation or discipline. It was just… bad information. I was building my entire morning around a number (45 min) that was completely fictional. Of course I was always running late.\n\nAnyway that’s it. Genuinely curious — has anyone else actually timed their routines like this? What was the gap between what you expected and what was real? I feel like this can’t just be me lol",

The act of creating a tangible list makes it more likely to stick around in your brain, and the visual cue keeps attention flowing to it. \n\nIf you're into planning and like sticking to schedules, you might look ahead at your course load for each week and set up post-class activities per day. Maybe schedule gaming or shows/movies for heavy academic days, and reading/writing for the light ones. \n\nYou might also automate task switching, if that works better with your brain. Set up automations with Shortcuts / equivalent, reminders, alarms, etc., that automatically transition you out of one \"focus mode\" to the next. This might look like having your home smart lighting change colors at a certain time, or setting up a shortcut that makes your computer go into airplane mode at 6 pm. \n\nThe key takeaway is to reduce the barrier of entry to the tasks you want to do! Self-discipline is often little more than good habits & structure.",

      "text": "morning routines...., ah I like these 2 words which people usually using to describe what they perfect mornings look like, what they do in the mornings, etc. You know, these videos from Instagram people doing bunch of the stuff in the morning and u just look at this: what th is that? Like get up at 5am, сold water with ice, smear your face with a banana, etc.\n\nAll this is performative bs and survivorship bias. I don't know anynone in real life who actually doing all these bunch things in the mornings, lol.\n\nSo, let's start not from the morning, but before that -> your evenings. They matter exactly the same, even more than mornings. Think about what u doing before sleep? Watching something? Dinner?\n\nI found some things essential in the evenings, mostly time before sleep\n\n\\-> no phones at least 1 hour before sleep (you probably already heard about blue light) and it really breaks your sleep quality. Worse sleep = worse morning\n\n\\-> no dinner close to sleap like 3 hours (your body need to relax and actually be ready for the next day, not digest all things you eat before)\n\n\\-> I also found from personal experience that I need to avoid stress or sport just at the late evenings. Otherwise, I just can't fall asleep at least 30 minutes, it depends on the person overall, but Im that kind who thinks a lot\n\n\\-> Make your room between hot and cold, something like a bit less warm, open window and let your room fill with fresh air, comfortable sleep is the best\n\n\\-> plan your day ahead + go sleep at the same time, no more 1 more series at late night\n\noh, okay, that's already much in one post, so morning tips (i don't wanna make fluff here):\n\n\\-> wake at the same time, even in the weekends\n\n\\-> avoid scrolling at any price in the first 2 hours. What I found from myself -> open scrolling, even 10 minutes -> day feeling like a shit, can't do anything productive fr\n\n\\-> shower + meditation is one of the best combos I found. You first wake up -> no phone -> go to shower, while you drying out, meditation and thinking about what you gonna do this day, this literally helps me a lot\n\nThat's something like this, I could include more info but don't wanna look like a big damn article. Ofc you shouldn't follow all the rules, start small, adapt what works for you, Im just sharing what works for me. It would be also good idea to share what helped you in comments, so people can adapt your tips as well\n\nseee yaaaa",

That lost feeling is basically your brain going wait... we have free time and no one is telling us what to consume? It doesnt know what to do with itself because social media was filling every gap of boredom for years.\n\nAs an artist you actually have such a huge advantage here. Some ideas for your offline time:\n\n- Sketchbook work. Not on the iPad, actual pencil and paper. Its a totally different creative muscle and theres something about the tactile feel that hits different.\n\n- Go to a coffee shop or park and draw what you see. Observational drawing is insanely good for improving your art AND it gets you out of the house.\n\n- Physical movement. Doesnt have to be a gym thing. Walk, stretch, dance in your room. Your body has been sitting while scrolling for years and it needs to move.\n\n- Cook something new. Seriously. Following a recipe is productive, creative, and you eat at the end of it. Win win win.\n\n- Just sit and be bored. I know this sounds unhelpful but learning to be comfortable with silence and empty space is one of the most powerful things you can do. Thats where your best creative ideas will come from.\n\nThe fact that you dont know what to do without social media shows exactly why quitting was the right call. Give yourself grace - it takes about 2-3 weeks for your brain to stop looking for the quick dopamine hit and start finding joy in slower things.",

This is when I let my mind drift and do whatever comes to mind - dishes, planning for groceries, things that I've been putting off\n\n\\- I've also added a 30 minute workout goal, whenever I want to reach my phone, i asked myself, did I do my workout yet?\n\n\\- Overtime, I become more curious of some subjects and hobbies. I recently take up air dry clay and started learning art history with ChatGPT.\n\nHope this helps, and best of luck to you!",

So as for what you should do, indulging in other activities, you see, I would suggest that it depends on your goals, what you want to achieve, and then those goals turn into your daily actions to help you reach them. But if you want to spend your time in some better activities, I would suggest you start working on your body by doing some workouts and learning some new skills. Since you seem to be a creative fella, how about learning writing, editing, or graphic designing? Maybe that will work. You can try them as well, and like, watch something educational as well on any topic you're interested in, you always wanted to know about. \n\nAside from that, there are several activities you can do, like walking or spending time with yourself alone. Yeah, those boring breaks, just sitting with your own mind, understanding and hearing your own thoughts. Because most people don't do it, that's why we feel so conflicted most of the time or overwhelmed. You can try meditating. Believe me, it will help a lot. You will feel a lot better, both in your mood and energy. And look, no matter what you pick, you just have to set time, so much effortless and short for it at first, then gradually increase. Like meditating for 5 minutes, or you know what's even better? Setting challenges to do daily, like 50 push-ups or 100 push-ups. These are also best for you. You can do it with pull-ups as well, like whatever you want. I hope this will help. Peace.",

If you’re already drawing a lot on the iPad, that’s great, but when you’re not, don’t try to replace social media with something equally stimulating. That just turns into another screen habit. Some days I read, some days I just sit with music, some days I do nothing useful at all. That’s still rest.\n\nAlso, it’s okay if your days feel slower. You don’t need to fill every gap with productivity. A short walk, stretching, cleaning one small thing, flipping through an art book, even just staring out the window for ten minutes, that stuff matters more than it sounds. Boredom is usually where better ideas show up.\n\nYou’re not failing at balance. You’re just in the awkward in-between where your brain is relearning how to exist without constant input.

I only really use Reddit, but I don’t count it.\n\nmy time and productivity has improved significantly. at first, it was quite difficult as I’m a young adult, & also a business student. you soon realize little to no one cares about your life online, and neither should you about others. the active feeling of fomo is what makes social media so addictive. \n\nask yourself, why are you so compelled to go on X apps? I’m still improving with some apps (I frequent Pinterest fairly often), but whenever I feel like it’s useless consuming instead of intentional, I remind myself of other things I could be doing. tbh, I struggle with it less now that my academics have gotten a lot more intense where I don’t have spare time. \n\non my school breaks, almost every single day of summer/holiday break, I was constantly doing something hobby related. sewing, drawing, baking, etc. hanging out with people is fulfilling too. \n\nwhile there are so many things I’ve done in my pursuit of betterment, a large thing I’d suggest is journaling. I’ve been doing it more or less for the last seven years, but when I really began implementing it in my life consistently is when I noticed change. specifically an improvement journal, and a planner. when you write into action what you’d like to achieve, new things you’d like to try; it becomes more of a desire rather than a passing thought, and you are inclined to put it into action more instead of mindless social media scrolling.\n\nsorry for the long mumble jumble! hope this helps :)",

That doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong or that you’re suddenly unproductive. It just means you’re not being constantly fed noise anymore. It feels like boredom but it’s really your attention resetting.\n\nAs an artist especially, that gap matters. Creativity usually comes after boredom, not before it. Sitting there not knowing what to do, staring out the window, walking with no podcast on, doing something slightly pointless. That’s often when ideas show up later on, even if it doesn’t feel productive in the moment. Rest without stimulation still counts as rest.\n\nYou also don’t need to replace social media with something equally intense. Reading a few pages, sketching badly on purpose, cleaning one small thing, going for a short walk, then stopping. It’s fine if your days feel quieter and smaller for a while. You’re not wasting time, you’re learning how to be alone with your thoughts again.\n\nIf you’re interested, I write about attention, money, and modern life stuff like this from a very normal perspective.

It's a lot easier to slowly build up habits over years than to try to make a bunch of huge changes at once.\n* Go easy on myself. If I feel like I screwed up (by doing too much organizing and burning out, by not getting enough done etc.) I just don't let it bother me. It has never helped me to beat myself up over anything.\n* Set time limits. If you want to completely overhaul something and it will take many hours, just spend 15 minutes on it every day or two instead of using your entire day to knock it out. Really this is about prioritizing. If your work is the most important part of your day, don't spend your entire day organizing things. Spend a bit of it organizing things and the rest working.\n* Pay attention to my energy levels and learn to rest. I also have ADHD so it is important to manage my stimulant dosage on top of my focus and my sleep. And I have found there is little reason to try to force myself to get things done when I am burned out. It's better to rest to get more done later.\n* Meditation has been the most important habit for me. It helps you to see exactly how your mind works, which lets you deal with these types of things with more wisdom.\n\nHope some of that helps!",

There are some passion projects I like to work on, such as learning chess or spending more time with my son. To make time for them, I decided to plan my time and priorities much more effectively. So I picked up a system called the 12-week year, which gives you an entire structure for setting your goals, using time, creating weekly plans, and so on. ",

This strategy would most likely resolve most of your motivation, emotion and enery problems as well as make life fun.\n\nGood on the gym. You are still young at 27. Can you create a goal to work towards also with your degree for motivation as well as the above social group support system method perhaps with other maths students?\n\nJoin some clubs where they do activities that help you forget about yiur work and get you out of your head also… can you think of some? Try to split room and sleep from study and work spaces if you can also and try to allocate time at each and not over do any of these either.\n\nGood luck and I am sure you will find a good way forwards.",

To get your dopamine working without being on screens every hour on the hour get up and pick up 10 things and put them away.  The rest of the hours is yours to do what you want.  But the act of putting 10 things away gives your brain such a dopamine hit that you probably won’t wanna just sit there the rest of the day but if you do, that’s OK just keep doing 10 things.  Then add some exercise 5 to 10 minutes a day.  Remember, you’re crawling out of a hole not running a marathon.  You’re gonna need help so call upon any friend you have to meet you for coffee. To come over and say hi.  Whatever. Ask your parents for help since you’re still living with them.  Ask them if they’ll go for a walk with you.  Try to eat dinner with them nightly.  Conversation and human connection does wonders for resetting the brain.  Let me know how this goes. I really do care.",

They ebb and flow, but your state sounds pretty severe and you sound very unhappy about it.\n\nOne small thing you could do even in bed or wherever is reflection/meditation/prayer (whatever suits you). Just reflect on your desire to do more and feel a lot of self-compassion around the desire versus the inability right now. Just conscious awareness of the problem, the genuine frustration, and knowing that you are in dostress over this. Be gentle though. It's a self-love exercise not an 'I should!' 'why can't I?' sort of thing.\n\nThe gym sounds like a positive. Just the other day after a bike ride I thought to myself 'i never regret this!' even though I had to push myself about 25 times to break through the resistance and actually get our there. It's real, and it's powerful. Don't ever let anyone tell you it's easy!\n\nhope you can find the help and solutions you need. Thanks for being brave enough to write this.

If I’m working on a big project that’s due in a month. I know I have at least 30 hours to devote to it.  I might be able to squeeze in some more if I have leftover time, but I budget myself for one hour a day though, in fact, I may end up giving it for five or even eight hours.

Two quiet minutes of motion do more than an hour of wrestling with yourself.\n\nKeep your systems light enough to breathe. Plans that evolve with you create trust instead of pressure. When something in your setup feels stale or heavy, change it. Tools are supposed to serve your direction, not become another weight to carry.\n\nOne task that feels honest, one tiny beginning, one schedule that forgives you as you grow... that’s usually enough to unstick the day.",

Tiny moments where you’re not “on” for anyone — a short walk between calls, standing in the kitchen staring out the window with a drink, lying on the floor for five minutes after work, music in your headphones while doing something mindless. And one weekday evening that’s officially a low-effort night with zero expectations. Those little pressure valves are what keep busy lives feeling livable, not just manageable.",

Doesn't have to be earth shattering, but you'd be surprised that getting the blood flow going is super helpful for those long days.\n\nOn the days when I'm buried with calls, I alternate the meetings between standing and sitting for each call. Additionally if it's a teams call and I don't have to have my video camera on I take the meeting on my phone with ear buds and walk around my property.\n\nHalfway through the day around lunchtime, it's mandatory to go outside and get fresh air. This also helps my seasonal affect disorder.\n\nFinally at the end of the day I take a pad of paper and I write down all the things that I want to do first thing the next day or that's on my mind that way I can fall asleep faster.

I’ve had years of setbacks with my career and mental health. I’m finally doing an MSc in Computing while also doing a remote internship, but I still feel behind in life, no stable job, small social circle, no hobbies, and honestly just feeling stuck.\n\nThere’s a girl I’ve been following on social media for years. She’s from the same cultural and religious background as me, which already makes her feel “familiar.” But her lifestyle is the complete opposite of mine. She’s successful in tech, confident, travelling with friends, partying, wearing revealing clothes, always looking stunning, featured in online videos about IT, living a life that seems full of independence and freedom.\n\nI don’t know her. I’ve never spoken to her. But I end up obsessively checking her social media, sometimes even looking at her family members or friends just to see more photos of her. It feels creepy and unhealthy, and I hate that I’m doing it. It’s like I’m obsessed to this fantasy version of her life.\n\nMeanwhile, I’m struggling with my own identity and direction. Instead of focusing on myself, I’m scrolling through her life and feeling worse about my own.

Every time you think about checking her profile, or reading about someone you’ll inevitably compare yourself to, do something that will benefit YOU. Seriously. \n\nWhenever you feel that urge to check her profile, force yourself to use the time to learn something new about your field, find an event or party or even just a new place to go to (since you’ve mentioned wanting to be more social), etc. Envision the best version of yourself every single day, and figure out how you can work towards being that person with daily tasks, because right now it feels like an ideal instead of a plan with actionable steps. That’s why you get overwhelmed.\n\nYou can do anything you put your mind to. I really believe in you. ",

It looks more like a moment in life where everything feels stuck, and social media gives your brain an easy target to project that frustration onto. When you see someone your age who seems confident, free, and moving forward, it naturally amplifies the feeling of being left behind.\n\nThe truth is that being 32 and feeling lost isn’t a failure. A lot of people go through phases like this, but we rarely see them because once things improve, we forget how heavy those moments felt. Life isn’t linear, and age doesn’t mean much when everyone’s path is completely different.\n\nI’ve had the exact same comparison spiral very recently. Same thought of “we’re the same age, why are we not in the same place?” And what helped me was realizing how quickly everything can shift. Two years can change almost everything. You might not see it now, but the version of you two or three years from now may feel very far from where you’re standing today.\n\nThat said, repeatedly checking her profile keeps you mentally anchored in the same place. It doesn’t mean you’re weak, it just means your brain is looking for escape. Muting or blocking isn’t running away, it’s giving yourself room to focus on building something of your own.\n\nThis feeling won’t last forever, even if it feels overwhelming right now. Once your own life starts gaining momentum again, the comparison loses its grip. Small steps, real experiences, and time do more than any amount of thinking ever will.",
