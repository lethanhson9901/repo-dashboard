Then I tried doing it first thing in the morning but id just dread waking up.\n\nNow I do like 20 to 30 min of the boring crap right before jumping into my main project and something about getting that friction out of the way puts me in this weird flow state. Like my brain is so relieved to finally work on something that actually matters that it just locks in.\n\nHonestly didn't expect this to work but I've been more consistent with everything and even have some money from Stаke saved up for once which feels good.",

And as it turns out... it's not unusual that a lot of small tasks never ***needed*** to be done at all in the end.\n\nObviously there's exceptions, like booking flights and stuff where doing at the last minute can go wrong.

I just vacuumed i might as well mop i havent mopped in months... and on and on. I could do BS tasks forever. They will literally never end.  \n  \nI've been struggling trying to train myself out of that mindset. Like Self talk:\"the big task\" really isnt a big task dude, it's BS too, it doesnt need to be perfectly planned and 100% effort, 80% effort will be the same as 100% and will take 1/5th the time.

A lot of tasks aren’t hard, they just carry a tiny emotional charge, like uncertainty, self judgment, or the fear of doing it wrong. Research and planning feel productive because they let you stay in control without touching that discomfort. What helped me was shrinking tasks until they had almost no emotional weight, like opening the email draft without sending it, or writing one rough sentence. Once the task stops feeling like a verdict on you, action gets easier. I’d be careful about trying to numb the feelings away, because the signal is useful. The real shift for me was learning to act alongside the discomfort instead of waiting for it to disappear.",

For example, instead of writing one rough sentence, I would only focus my awareness on writing a single letter at a time. But that takes a lot of practice to do well. And it can be done even better than that. If you get good enough, you just take each moment as it arrives.

Shrink your tasks until it feels almost stupid not to start. When motivation is gone, stop asking yourself to “finish” anything. The goal is just to begin. I like to set a single Pomodoro (I use pomofocus.io) and tell myself I’m only working until the timer ends. Don't think about anything beyond that first cycle.\n2. Use habit contracts. One of the biggest takeaways from Atomic Habits is that habits stick when the cost of failure is immediate. You HAVE to pre-commit to a consequence before your future self tries to negotiate their way out of doing the thing. Habit contracts will be your best friend. I use Line (try-line.app) because I like having it on my computer, but I know there are also other mobile apps that do the same.\n3. Lower the bar for your success. A huge reason people quit is all-or-nothing thinking. Just because you miss one day or go halfway to your goal doesn't mean it's all over now. Consistency is better than intensity when it comes to long-term productivity, motivation, and discipline. Do something today that you'll thank yourself for tomorrow.\n\nYou got this!",

It’s a trap because researching feels like progress, but it’s just a sophisticated way of avoiding the discomfort of starting.\n\nYou mentioned your emotions tell you to delay tasks. That happens because when a task list is vague or overloaded, your brain perceives it as a threat.\n\nWhat finally clicked for me was a radical shift to **extreme simplicity** based on the **80/20 Principle**.\n\nWe often forget that **80% of our results come from only 20% of our actions.** Most of the stuff on our \"infinite to-do lists\" is just noise that makes us anxious. Here is my framework now:\n\n1. **The Rule of 5:** I pick exactly 5 high-impact tasks per day. These are my \"20%\". If I have 20 things to do, I force myself to pick the 5 that actually move the needle.\n2. **Binary thinking:** I either \"Win\" the day (5/5) or I don't. It stops the emotional negotiation. When the target is that small, your brain stops panicking.\n3. **Visual Statistics:** I started tracking my \"Win streaks\" (Days -> Weeks -> Months). Seeing real data on when I’m actually winning vs. just being \"busy\" changed everything. It turns productivity into a game you don't want to lose.\n\nStop researching supplements and start shrinking your list until it's impossible to fail.

No negotiating with myself. This built momentum and reduced my mental backlog.\n\n2. **Separating \"deciding\" from \"doing\"** - I noticed I was re-deciding whether to do things every time I looked at them. Now I make decisions once (usually the night before) and just execute the next day without reopening the debate.\n\nAshwagandha might help with anxiety, but I'd focus on the behavioral patterns first.

      "text": "I had this small but uncomfortable realization recently: most of the things I tell myself are “productive” are really just me avoiding the work I don’t want to do.\n\nI’ll organize my desk. Clean my inbox. Reformat notes. Rename files. Make a to-do list so detailed it feels like progress. And at the end of the day, the actual task that mattered is still untouched.\n\nFor a long time I let myself believe this counted as productivity. At least I wasn’t *wasting time*, right? I was being busy. I was doing things. Everything looked cleaner and more organized, so it felt justified.\n\nBut it finally clicked that busy and effective are not the same thing.\n\nI noticed it one evening while I was playing jackpot city on my PC and taking a break between sessions. I realized I’d spent the entire day “preparing” to work, and none of that preparation had actually moved anything forward. I had just made avoidance look respectable.\n\nThe hard part is that productive procrastination feels good. It gives you the dopamine of motion without the discomfort of focus. There’s no risk, no resistance, no chance of failing at the real task. Just activity.\n\nOnce I started calling it what it is, it became harder to hide from myself. Now when I catch myself reorganizing instead of doing the thing I said mattered, I stop and ask whether this actually moves the needle or just makes me feel better.\n\nI still clean and organize. That stuff has its place. But I’m trying to be honest about when I’m doing it because it needs to be done, and when I’m doing it to avoid the work that actually counts.\n\nIt’s been uncomfortable, but also clarifying. Less pretending. More intention.",

Working less can get you more done. Grinding works until it doesn't.\n2. Raising prices increases sales. Counterintuitive but the logic is: high price = high trust for valuable services. Cheap signals low value.\n3. Being hyper-specific gets broader reach. He uses this archery analogy - aiming for the bullseye hits more of the target than vaguely aiming at the whole thing.\n4. Internal distractions beat external ones 5:1. 80% of focus problems are your brain avoiding discomfort (boredom, anxiety) not your phone. Which means app blockers solve 20% of the problem.\n5. Jobs aren't secure. This one's uncomfortable. Single income source = high risk. Golden handcuffs are real.\n6. Failure is part of success, not opposite of it. Business is asymmetrical - many attempts for one win. Nobody wants to hear this but the data shows it repeatedly.\n7. Creating teaches more than consuming. The creation-to-consumption ratio matters. Building something beats reading another book about building.\n\nTheme frequency across 50 videos:\n\n* Financial freedom: 20 videos\n* Goals: 15 videos\n* Entrepreneurship: 14 videos\n* Productivity: 12 videos\n* Mindset: 10 videos\n\nGuy's core obsession is wealth building and escaping 9-5. Everything else supports that.\n\nMost repeated tactical advice:\n\n* 90 day goals work better than annual ones\n* Write goals somewhere you'll see them\n* Learn high-income skills (sales, marketing, AI)\n* Start before ready, clarity comes from doing\n* Solve expensive problems for people with money\n\nAnyone applied the \"work less\" principle or tried 90 days goals?\n\nEdit: Methodology was scraping transcripts and comments with TaffySearch, then AI for data analysis",

Don't take him seriously, he just makes content for people who think they're doing something by watching an hour of youtube self help and writing down half a page of roughly scribbled notes. \n\nI do think James Scholz suffers from a similar problem but not to the same degree, the guy just posts about cool looking retro tech and it seems all very consumerist and perfomative nowadays.

I just created a daily entry template with prompts I actually care about (things I’m grateful for, one thing I learned, one thing I *want* to remember) and copy/pasted it into a new note each day.\n\nI tried a bunch of “journaling apps” at first and always quit after a week because they felt too complicated or gamified, but this plain setup has stuck for months because it feels low-pressure. I don’t worry about streaks or paying for features, I just open my notes app and write.\n\nFor someone who struggles with habits, the key for me was lowering the friction so much that it felt easier to do it than skip it. Maybe tweaking whatever tool you pick to be as simple as possible would help you actually keep it going.",

      "text": "When I sat down to study, I knew exactly what needed to be done. Dozens of chapters needed revision. Many topics needed clarification. There were clear academic priorities in front of me.\n\nYet, instead of studying, I found myself endlessly scrolling on YT, social media, or searching for that one perfect video that would suddenly make me productive. I kept consuming motivation and study hacks, hoping something would finally click.\n\nThis went on for months.\n\nThen I realised that Most online motivation and productivity hacks only work when your mind is already relatively focused. They do not create focus. They only amplify it if it already exists.\n\nMy mind, however, was constantly preoccupied by social media, FOMO, thoughts of parties, new web series, and what others were doing. In that state, no amount of motivation could help.\n\nWhen I started meditation and yoga, something interesting happened. A question arose very clearly in my mind.\n\nWhy do I suddenly feel the urge to check social media, watch a web series, or go out with friends only when I sit down to study?\n\nThat question led me to the root of my problem.\nMy mind was already filled with impressions I had fed it earlier. Every time I gave in to an urge to scroll, delay work, or escape discomfort, I strengthened that pattern. Over time, my mind learned to trick me into believing that those distractions were more important than my actual priorities.\n\nThis, I realized, was the real cause of my procrastination.\nMeditation didn't brought disciplin. What it did was far more important. It gave me a pause.\n\nThat pause changed everything.\n\nInstead of immediately giving in to an urge, I could observe it. Instead of reacting compulsively, I could remind myself of what actually mattered. In that small moment of awareness, I could make a conscious choice.\n\nYoga and meditation together helped me shift from automatic behavior to conscious action. Meditation brought mental clarity,  while yoga helped my body stay energetic. As I continued both practices, my daytime tiredness gradually reduced. Earlier, I would feel sleepy and dull while studying. Now, I remain alert and fresh for long study sessions without that constant urge to lie down or escape.\n\nSlowly, the distracting loop weakened. I stopped delaying important work. I stopped negotiating with my mind. For the first time, I was able to actually complete my tasks without any resistance.\n\nAnd also I cleared the initial stages of competitive exams in just 2-3 months of focused studies, ofcourse the latter stage weren't that good but clearing those initial stages gave me confidence with clarity that I could do much more , this really felt impossible earlier.\n\n“Once you go beyond the compulsive, cyclical nature of existence, life becomes spectacular.”\n-Sadhguru\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTL;DR\nI knew what I had to study but kept procrastinating through scrolling and searching for motivation. I realized that motivation only works when the mind is already focused. Meditation helped me pause instead of reacting to urges, while yoga gave me sustained energy. Together, they broke my procrastination loop, improved clarity, and helped me complete tasks and clear initial stages of competitive exams with confidence.",

While that has been valuable I realize I am lacking in many other areas that could compound over time especially skills related to career growth money communication and personal discipline.\n\nI am trying to identify skills that provide a strong long term return on investment whether that return shows up as better job opportunities financial stability confidence or overall quality of life. I am open to both hard skills such as technical business or creative skills and soft skills such as communication emotional regulation habits and mindset.\n\nI would really appreciate insights from people who are further along in life or their careers. What skills ended up paying off the most for you over time? Which skills do you wish you had started learning earlier in your 20s? Are there any skills you invested time in that turned out to be overrated or less useful than expected?\n\nI am not looking for shortcuts just guidance on where consistent effort over the next few years would matter most.

I had to learn to code because I started studying finance and creating applications related to my stock trading.\n\nCoding × whatever area you want to impact = CA$H\n\nSo lets say you learn to code. Other people will use you for your ability to code. That's called a job. The people who pay you will use your code in other areas of life, like science or art or even regular chores.\n\nIf you can gain ideas/skills in something you are also passionate about like let's say dancing. You can make applications for dancers to help them learn/perform or solve whatever problem they have. How do you know what dancers need? You have to be an insider. A dancer too! You just married your skills and solved a problem! Exponential returns. People will thank you in the form of money.\n\nYou need to understand the problems other people are having and solve those problems with your own set of skills. You are paid in proportion to how big the problems you fix are.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to coding btw. If I'm a gym goer and a psychologist. How can physical fitness help my mental health?

Clear communication, writing simply, and being able to explain ideas to non technical people mattered way more than another tool or language. That’s what actually unlocked better jobs and trust.\n\nThe second one was personal discipline around health and money. Sleep, lifting or some form of training, cooking, and not living paycheck to paycheck gave me energy and confidence that spilled into everything else. It sounds basic but most people never lock this in, so the ones who do pull ahead quietly.\n\nOne thing I wish I’d started earlier was deliberately practicing communication. Writing regularly, public speaking even if it’s uncomfortable, and learning how to give and receive feedback without getting defensive. That skill shows up everywhere, relationships, work, leadership.\n\nOverrated for me were grinding niche tools without context. I spent time learning things that felt productive but didn’t actually move my leverage forward because they weren’t paired with real problems or people.\n\nIf you keep stacking core skills, communication, health, financial basics, and one strong technical track, the compounding is very real by your late 20s. You’re already asking the right questions.\n\nThat should land well, feel human, and invite upvotes and replies instead of sounding like a lecture.",

When I add a new team member those are the skills I need--can this person find their way out of a paper sack? Can they look a a proposed process and see where the process can fail and how to make it work? Can they think of how to instill confidence and calm as we address an issue? \n\n\nI think looking at multiple view points on various topics helps develop this skill. Well, not just looking, but developing understanding and really processing how people reach different conclusions. Understanding how others think, builds our own ability to think.",

(a lot of other examples like McAfee).\n\nPeople usually imagine a thing and learn the requirements to achieve it whilw trying to accomplish it. Me myself lernt how to code while dreaming about my dream game. While this is a great strategy to learn a knew thing it's not great to accomplish something huge, because the lack of knowledge slow things down. (My dream game was taking so much that I simple quit)\n\nThere is the quote, if you wanna chop a tree in 10hrs you should spend most of that time preparing and sharpening your tools... That means when the time to chop the tree comes, you will already have everything that you need.\n\nTL;DR Go get better on what you will spend time in the future",

          "text": "You are distractible, because you unwittingly trained yourself to be. Spending hours every day on the smartphone or computer is practicing distraction. And digital stuff is designed to be addictive, to increase profits, and it's ruined the attention span of an entire generation of people. It's dopamine overstimulation; and makes everything else boring by comparison.\n\nOne gains focus the same way one gains distractability; by practicing it. Meditation, focusing on the breath, is one way to practice focus; you focus on the breath, mind starts drifting away, you catch yourself starting to distract yourself, then ignore the distraction, and return to the breath, over and over and over again. The more one practices this, the more one's ability to focus and stay focused on the breath improves.\n\nSame with homework. Notice your attention starting to drift, catch yourself drifting, redirect your mind back to your homework, again and again and again. Hard, even painful, at first, gets easier over time.\n\nCreating a distraction-free environment helps, too. So does putting obstacles in the way of doing distracting things. If you take a break, use a timer to alert you when break time is over. Reminder apps help too, in reminding you it's time to do a certain task. When doing homework, turn off the internet entirely, preferably unplug it, so that turning it back on requires getting up, walking over, plugging it back in. This helps \"wake you up\" out of the subconscious habit of scrolling.\n\nAmerican Hindu monk Dandapani has a great TED talk on [\"Unwavering Focus\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2JK_94g3Y). Worth the watch. He had the same problem with focusing, once.",

I know that seems silly, but if you don’t believe in your work, you’ll do anything to not get it done. Social media, and Reddit, isn’t a bad thing to be on, there’s a lot of good community in here if you know where to look. But set a timer when you get on your computer, say 30 minutes?

I would sit down with a single, almost boring task like read two pages or write three rough sentences, then stop and reset.

Maybe if you don’t do anything that’s fun or entertaining in your free time, and Reddit is the only thing that spikes your dopamine, that’s why you do it. I think your mindset about this is wrong, because your parents are telling you it’s bad, and you are constantly telling yourself it is, and you feel awfull. But I see you as a person who is responsible and smart, so it’s probably your way of rewarding yourself or relaxing. I think you should just set a timer for how long you scroll on Reddit, and try to not do it every time you take a break. Let’s say you study today, then you scroll Reddit one time, then you study again and after this bout of studying you do promodoro and just stare at something uninteresting for 5 minutes. And every time change the order of the breaks, one time the first break is the promodoro, and then Reddit and so on. Make it random so your brain doesn’t know when a dopamine spike is going to come, and help with it not being dependable on it. \n\nI hope this helps.",

It always sounded obvious, but I never actually committed to it. My usual routine was: open laptop, skim emails, clear a few tiny to dos, and promise myself I’d dive into the big project in a bit. Spoiler: I almost never did.\n\nA couple of months ago I finally decided to give it a real shot. I picked one big project I’d been avoiding for months and made a simple rule for myself: one hour every morning, first thing, before checking messages or touching anything else. Just sixty minutes of focused work.\n\nThe first week was rough. My brain really wanted the easy dopamine of emails and small tasks. But after a few days, it started to feel different. That one focused hour kind of anchored the whole day. Once I pushed through the hardest thing upfront, everything afterward felt lighter and more manageable. Three weeks later, the project I’d been dragging my feet on for ages was finished.\n\nLast night I was on my phone playing jackpot city and spacing out, and it hit me how much less mentally heavy my workload feels now. Same job, same tasks, but that tiny routine change completely shifted how I approach my day. It even made me notice how I handle other small rewards too, like when I mess around with Mistplay to earn points from random mobile games and trade them in for the occasional Amazon gift card as a little post frog treat. \n\nAt this point, eat the frog is basically my default setting: do the hard thing first, and the rest of the day kind of feels like bonus time.",

It does many things that R does, but in the python syntax so more transferable skills.\n\nStart with the fundamentals. CS50 is a free course that teaches that. Not in R, but that doesn't matter at this point. After that jump back into R. Do all the problem sets again, but in R. Use a LLM to help you with the syntax.\n\nI don't know your background or goals, but if you want to do stats or machine learning, I recommend you do a separate course on linear algebra and calculus. If you only do straightforward analyses and data visualisation, you can skip this.\n\nWhile you're familiarising yourself with the maths, you can start working on problem sets that use the data that ship with R. These are all over the internet. It's vital to understand how R stores and interacts with data (dataframes, vectors (confusing name because it's not a vector)) and how to access and changes values (indeces etc).\n\nAfter that, I'd jump straight into a project you have. It will be messy, but you'll get through it understanding a bunch more. After that, it's just iterating as fast as possible building a portfolio of projects.",

First couple team meetings tho it got weirdly awkward. People kept glancing at them even tho I wasnt recording anything. You could just feel that \"wait is he recording us?\" vibe. After 3-4 meetings I stopped bringing them cause it was affecting the actual conversations.\n\nTried those recording pen things too but honestly carrying another device that needs charging felt like it defeated the purpose. I already wear glasses everyday so something that just replaces those made the most sense to me.\n\nEventually switched to audio-only smart glasses for meetings without cameras. Found some called dymesty that have a titanium frame which feels pretty solid, kinda reminds me of my old lindberg frames. They just look like regular glasses which is exactly what I needed.\n\nThe transcription spits out meeting summaries and action items which actually saves me a ton of time going back thru notes later. Battery lasts a few days so its pretty low maintainence.\n\nObvious tradeoff is no video capture which would be useful sometimes for whiteboard sessions or demos. But honestly having people act natural in meetings matters way more for actually getting work done.\n\nWhat tools have actually stuck for you guys? Voice recorders? Note taking apps? Im curious what ended up being genuinley useful vs just creating more friction in your workflow.",

My experience IRL: a meeting usually has anywhere zero-two pages worth of actual noteworthy info to record. \n\nI started years back with recording everything in handwriting, which is fast-ish and extremely flexible (sometimes a few sketchy arrows or some weird shaped squiggle can save a few lines of text). All that served was a memory aid, which I’d then turn into real, distilled meeting notes. Some info became tasks, some became appointments, some became emails, very small amounts became long-term info to (catalogue in a super easily findable, effortless system) keep long term. \n\nIf i waited a few hours, the paper-to-final would lose quality. 2-3 days later, was still a “pass”, but longer would usually mean my original notes are about half as useful. \n\nThe “trick” is … experience. Which allows you to half-process in real time what’s going to end up becoming a task, calendar, eml, data, etc. and either create those in real time, or jot down the essence of what those would contain. \n\nAlso, helps to make it imperative (by gently and timely bringing convo back on track when it slips off) for group to reach decisions or declare actions (with owner <- VITAL VITAL VITAL, a due date (or date for status update, by whom, to whom), and these derived actions need be super **clear** actions, which are a no brainer to know whether they were indeed done or neglected …and done/neglected by whom). \n\nWhen a decision/action cant be reached, group must either consciously decide the idea is not going to happen, or (if further info is required to decide), a decision when this item is due for discussion/resolution. I know that’s not exactly about note taking, but it is critical: a. To reduce useless meeting time and useless notes that do nothing IRL and b. a focused meeting leads to clarity what is going to become a task/appointment/email/another meeting/etc.\n\n**Tldr: dont just record every utterance made; rather keep asking “so what?”, and not the answer to that. Capture meaningful info, not raw data.**\n\nThese days, i just write an email to myself during the meeting, subject is “meeting with x about y”.  I try to understanding what needs to be done if at all about everything being said and just create tasks and cal appointments on the fly, even write short emails if those are the desired outcome of any exchange of words (eg if we’re talking about considering an equipment purchase, I’ll just email the vendor to request a quote for the equipment, takes < 1-2 min). **Only what cant easily be done on the fly** becomes a bullet point (hopefully) or a short paragraph (if all else fails; with key words bolded). End of meeting, email sent. These email-notes-to-self usually end up anywhere zero to 10 bullets.\n\nI get back to office. Asap: turn what’s left in that email to self into tasks/cal/immediate action/schedule follow up meetings/etc.",

Like many others, an audio recording has worked well for me in the past and I've always asked, \"Is it ok if I record\" and always get a yes though as others have said this isn't appropriate in every situation. One problem is that I'm essentially setting myself up to sit through the meeting twice (at 2x speed but still..) I've come to realize that I'm faster and more accurate typing my notes than I am writing them so I always try to do that whenever possible and have the format preset so that I have a place within my document to put to-dos and decisions in real time. If I have to write I have shorthand things like putting boxes around the to-dos/decisions (always with due dates) if they end up not in a list for some reason.Your role in the notetaking makes a difference too -am I taking notes while also running the meeting? That makes it a little easier to steer the conversation towards the exact topics and info that I'm looking for. Other times there's brainstorming and meandering before arriving at a decision (some of which is relevant to include and some not) so I do feel myself basically transcribing a meeting sometimes before the it becomes clearer which parts are important. I try to be prepared to highlight to-dos quickly so I can format them more clearly after the meeting and use strikethroughs, or greying out, something I can do fast that tells me that this part is outdated or less important and I can quickly polish the notes afterward (with or without the recording). By no means a perfect system, but the main thing I've learned is I do not rely on having a clear remembrance of the convo, as I've caught myself being wrong too many times. So, I try to clean the notes asap and definitely the same day.",

I’ve seen the same thing with cameras, bots announcing they’re transcribing, or people typing nonstop — it pulls everyone out of the room.\n\nWhat’s actually stuck for me is keeping it boring and invisible. Either audio-only capture (with clear consent once, not every meeting), or very light manual notes focused only on decisions + next actions. I don’t try to capture everything anymore. If a tool makes me manage batteries, devices, or awkward social dynamics, it’s a net loss, no matter how “smart” it is.\n\nThe big tradeoff you mentioned is real. Video is nice for whiteboards, but natural conversation beats perfect records every time. Anything that reduces friction during the meeting usually ends up saving more time after the meeting.

The problem is, if the music is a bit too good or really matches my taste, I can’t focus at all. I get distracted easily, and when music is good, my brain ends up paying attention to the music and vibing instead of concentrating on my work. Does anyone else have the same problem?

Not a whole routine, just move rooms or go for a short walk without headphones. Brain resets a bit. Sounds stupid but it works.\n\nAlso, writing down what I’m avoiding specifically helps. Like not the task, but the uncomfortable part of it. Once I see that, it’s easier to move.\n\nAnd some days honestly nothing works. I stop early and try again tomorrow.

Get natural sunshine (if there) in your eyes and take a short walk. It signals your biological clock to stay awake better than willpower can.\n2. **The Caffeine Timing:** If you drink coffee right when you wake up, that might be causing the afternoon crash. Huberman suggests waiting 60-90 minutes after waking up before your first cup. This prevents the \"adenosine crash\" that hits you right around the time you get home.\n3. **The Power Nap:** If you are exhausted, set a timer for **15 minutes max**. It sounds short, but it clears the mental fog without letting you enter deep sleep. If you sleep longer than 20 minutes, you'll wake up even groggier (sleep inertia).\n\nFor sure do not lay in bed scrolling: your brain associates that position with sleep.",

If you know you're going to sleep put an alarm as soon as you get home.   \n\n\nAlso it wouldn't be a bad idea to check with doctors if it becomes worse (that's what happened to me and turns out I was developping narcolepsy.) It is possible that your sleep hygiene has changed (maybe you use more screen time before bed, maybe you've started eating or drinking before sleeping, etc), or that the quality of your sleep as changed (mattress, pillows, temperature, sleep apnea), hence why you feel different dispite sleeping the same hours.",

I'm going to be honest, if I could go back and change anything, I would just wake up and start doing whatever work I had to do until it's done. Any time after that would be whatever time I have to hang out with friends or free time to myself. It doesn't sound good because this could often be 9pm or 10pm at night when you get done, but I would have rather built that discipline rather than hang out with friends which doesn't do much to improve your life. You also always have the weekends to hang out with them anyway.\n\nTrust me, unless something drastic changes like you somehow fix your sleep schedule or get some medication, just accept the nap for what it is and take care of business after. You'll thank yourself later in life when you've built this discipline of getting things done over procrastinating or indulging in pleasures. If you don't address this now, it'll put you in 10x worse positions later in life.",

          "text": "So sorry about this. \n1. Looking at your plan I would also add a daily learning/mastery plan of 2 hrs/day to upskill and make yourself marketable with quick wins… choosing things to learn that are easy and quick to pick up but will yield high payoffs in terms of significantly improving your job prospects and future work effectiveness. \n\n2. Research is highly important for experienced professionals as you likely have multiple sought after skills - hard and soft. \n\nIt is mandatory to not start until you are clear about what u want to do/where u want to work and your sweet spot -and only then, hit the ground daily starting with networking/applying for jobs. Then you will be able to not only find more opportunities but be able to confidently interview better and convert those opportunities into jobs. You would be able to articulate with confidence your sweet spot - \n\nIn this market be narrow, specific and relevant in your reachout so people who want to help can understand your ‘sweet spot’ better and provide you leads on your expertise areas, where u want to go and what u want to do. \n\nOnce the research is done it’s more about  plan for a quick start - and refine the target companies list daily based on what the companies and jobs are finding interesting, what your network is leading u to, and where you are finding more nibbles based on where you are casting. \n\n3. Aim to hit daily goals and be consistent. There is no certainty when the search will bear fruition. end of Feb - could be sooner or later - but there is full certainty in attaining daily networking reachouts, daily learning, daily activities u control and which maximize your chances for success. \n\n4. Finally, follow some career coaches daily on YouTube. I don’t know your line of work. I like Andy La Civita on YT, see if he resonates. (Disclaimer: I am only a fan, not associated with his business)  \n\n5. One opinion -  a small paid gig instead of volunteering when between jobs might be a better route, esp if it’s easy to get one, eg, from your network. But If you find u are spending as much time looking for a part-time as a full-time job. Then that’s not a route to take, and nor is volunteering. \n\nBest to be cautious about volunteering. it can can guzzle time, and signal your willingness to  accept low-value work - u can always volunteer after u land a job, if your motivation is to give back to society. \n\nRight now, u are vulnerable, I’d rather u spend time with high-value activities - attending meetups, learning events, meeting other professionals and learning about their companies/culture/what’ their companies are hiring for, self-care etc. I have volunteered seriously while out of a job, and feel incredibly proud of my contribution. But it seriously hurt perceptions and also time available for my job search \n\n You already have many skills, and a small humble paid job a few hrs a week (without taking time from job search and study) will keep you in action, bring continuity or work experience in your resume, pay some bills without tiring u out, signal u r flexible and nimble on your feet, and keep u in touch with people and in good mental health - so, so, important if one lives alone.\n\nGood luck! You will land - take baby steps, get into action fast. I see your comments and u got this! \n\nThe longer u wade in the shallows the harder it will get. If you land a job quickly, u will save your severance and come ahead. And rather  than ice-cream when you also wanted go hit the gym, I’d dance and watch comedies and cartoons everyday to keep me smiling :)",

I can pay for apps if needed.\n\nI’m going to school and do lot of other things, So I need a full productivity system that covers everything. Here’s what I’m looking for:\n\t\n• Task management: An app to manage all my homework and tasks, with priorities, rescheduling, and full versatility, A daily planner that keeps me on track because I often forget assignments until the day before.\n\n• Note-taking: The best app to take school notes efficiently.\n\n• Study & focus: Apps to improve focus while studying, e.g., Pomodoro technique or similar tools.\n\n• Habits: Apps or methods to track and build good daily habits.\n\n• Apple ecosystem settings: Any automation, shortcuts, or settings to make all devices work seamlessly together for maximum productivity.\n\nWhat apps, setups, or habits do you recommend for someone using a full Apple ecosystem who wants to maximize productivity?\n\nThanks in advance!",
