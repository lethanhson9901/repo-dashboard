              "text": "This is a tricky question because there are many different areas at the moment where AI might plausibly impact productivity. Let's go through a few...\n\nIn the world of computer programming, AI-supported tab-complete in code generation is clearly a time-saver. Vibe coding, by contrast, is more complicated. It produces working software faster than a human can do, so in that sense it increases productivity. But it's unclear to what degree vibe coded software will play a significant role in software development.\n\nWhen it comes to knowledge workers using chatbots, there are isolated use-cases where it clearly makes things more efficient (think: a journalist being able to accurately auto-transcribe an interview). But there are not as many such use cases yet as I would have expected. Using it to write emails or create slide show drafts is creating a lot of \"workslop\" that might be fast to produce but not actually that useful.\n\nAgents aren't ready for prime time yet outside the context of the terminal. They might never be. (I published an article about this for the New Yorker last month.)\n\nFor students, using chatbots to cheat -- e.g., produce answers for problem sets -- is clearly increasing productivity in some strict value-less sense of the word. Last year I wrote an article where I followed students using chatbots to help them write papers. Interestingly, the way they used them (which included lots of back-and-forth conversations) probably made it take longer to write the papers, but also made the experience feel less cogntively demanding.  i\n\n  \nTo me, the real productivity gains are yet to come. They will happen when people leave the chatbot interface and get custom tools, powered by RL-tuned LLMs, that are integrated into software tools where they do a small amount of automated efforts really well.",

I make a living thinking, so to have constant access to algorithmically-optimized distraction would be like a professional athlete smoking -- it would be counter-productive! \n\n  \nThe cons have been reducing with each passing year. For example, as these platforms increasingly follow a TikTok model of maximum engagement, most social interaction with friends and family has moved to chat, so I no longer miss out on that. (Just this morning, my brother was posting photos to our iMessage group about the ski trip he is on. A decade ago, he might have posted those on Facebook or Instagram instead.) I also think the rise of email newsletters and podcasts have made it easier to find interesting, independent voices on issues without having to rely on social platforms.\n\n  \nProbably the biggest con is that I could probably build a much larger audience if I was also very active on these alternative channels. But I like my audience! And I still sell books. So I'm fine with that...",

Leave it in your dorm to study. Go on a hike or walk without it. This helps break the mental loop in which boredom is always immediately rewarded with a digital diversion; (3) Aggressively seek out alternative activities and commitments with which to add meaning and diversion to your life. Make your analog life, in other words, so rich that the phone begins to pale by comparison.\n\n  \n(I'm actually writing a book now called THE DEEP LIFE, which seems oddly self-help-ey for someone like me who typically writes about taming technology. But I realized, at some point, that one of the most powerful things you can do to escape compulsive phone use is to make your life outside the screen more important and interesting to you.)",

Here it's helpful to use standard knowledge work productivity ideas. For example: \n\n \\- Time-block plan your day instead of being reactive  \n \\- Avoid collaboration through ad hoc messaging. If a message can't be answered in a single reply, then move the conversation to a phone call or person discussion.  \n \\- Implement processes to make work on recurring types of tasks more predictable and less interruptive.  \n \\- Implement full capture (never keep track of things only in your head).  \n \\- To ensure you're giving people reasonable time line expectations for the tasks you accept, try actually scheduling the time on your calendar, in advance, for when you'll complete the work you just accepted. This will help you quickly assess when you actually do have time to get things done.  \n  \\- protect time for actual work from meetings. This could mean having set hours protected every day, or you could practice the rule that everytime you schedule a meeting you have to schedule the same amount of time for deep work somewhere in that same week. \n\n  \nThe former skill (workload management) is about how you manage the number of things you agree to work on in the first place. This is a major focus of my book Slow Productivity. I think this is a new frontier in knowledge work productivity: turning our focusing from how to manage our work to how to manage what we allow to become our work.",

I'm friends with many of these authors. It's a good addition to the genre!\n\n  \nAll that being said, the basic principles of knowledge work productivity still apply: context switching reduces cognitive capacity, task overload is a scourge, and deep work is still the primary mechanism through which value is created.",

In SO GOOD, I call these the \"control traps.\" If you leave your current situation too early then you might not have enough career capital to succeed at something new. But when you do have enough capital is exactly when your employer won't want to lose you and will keep finding ways to keep you in their pipeline. \n\nA good test for leaving is whether or not people will give you money. That is, are customers buying your product, are other employers offering you a good salary? People will be quick to praise your plan, but they want offer you money unless what you're doing actually seems valuable.",

I get into new TV series or seek out absurd movies with cult followings.\n\nI have a whole set of podcasts I turn to when I don't want to think about a single serious thing! (A lot of them, for some reason, are theme park and rollercoaster related).\n\nI think creating a YT play list to then watch on your TV (as oppose to surfing auto-recommendations) can be fine too. Sometimes I'll binge maker videos with my kids.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that fandoms are a great way to introduce more meaningful fallbacks when exhausted by life. This includes both sports fandoms but also those tied to other media properties as well. They can give you a sense of meaning in a fun way and can be filling instead of dragging.",

I started watching a series and noticed that I practically jump out of bed in the morning because I can't wait to watch the next episode. \n\nNow this level of obsession is the exact reason why I stopped watching series in general. Right now I am on a school break and let myself enjoy it.\n\nBut it made me realize how important it is to have something to look forward to in the morning is. And I am wondering if you guys have your own little routine. Is there something you are excited to do in the morning?\n\nIf not I highly recommend finding something haha it was so strange. Normally waking up is such a drag for me. So I am looking for healthier more sustainable suggestions.",

It wasn’t really the show itself, it was having something queued up that felt just for me, before the day got noisy. That anticipation does a lot of work mentally.\n\nWhat helped me long term was swapping passive excitement for small intentional things. Simple stuff like a proper coffee I actually enjoy, a short walk with a podcast I only listen to in the morning, or spending twenty minutes working on something that feels like it’s slowly improving my life. Not exciting in the same dopamine way, but it builds a quieter pull to get up.\n\nI think the key difference is that shows give instant payoff, while routines give delayed payoff. The trick is making the delayed ones feel personal enough that your brain still wants them. Once I framed mornings as time I get to keep, not time I have to survive, it got easier.\n\nI’ve been thinking about this a lot lately around habits, money, and motivation in general. I write a bit about it from a normal perspective, nothing extreme. It’s on my profile if you’re curious, but either way you’re definitely onto something here.",

You go outside, you see what is good and well and you see what is wrong and bad, what can you do about it? Do you want to do anything about it? Is that what you’re passionate about? Do you strive to make any difference? To meet people? To find love or experience it? What more does life have to offer in terms of adventure than to let you, or perhaps force you, to give or find meaning to it? It is maybe the most “get out of bed we have to explore the world” thing that I’ve ever heard",

Your brain doesn’t wake up for discipline, it wakes up for anticipation. The trick is finding something low-stakes and repeatable, not something you binge and burn out on like a series. One small thing you genuinely enjoy in the morning is enough. It doesn’t have to be “productive.” It just has to be yours.",

Around mid-afternoon I noticed I was bouncing between tasks, checking things off, but not really finishing anything cleanly.\n\nNormally I’d respond by tightening up. Pomodoro timer, stricter list, less “wasted” time. Instead, I did the opposite. I left my desk, made coffee, and sat there for five minutes doing absolutely nothing. No phone, no planning, no optimizing.\n\nWhen I came back, I finished the next task faster than I expected. And the one after that. It wasn’t because I found some secret trick, it was because my brain had stopped resisting. I realized how much of my productivity problem comes from constantly trying to force output instead of letting focus reset naturally.\n\nI still plan my day and I still care about getting things done. I even keep money set aside from myprize so I don’t feel pressure to grind every minute just to feel secure. But I’ve started leaving intentional gaps instead of packing everything tight, and weirdly, more gets finished.\n\nI think I confused being busy with being effective for a long time. Turns out sometimes the most productive thing you can do is stop trying to be productive for a moment. Curious if anyone else noticed something similar once they loosened their grip a bit.",

It sounds productive but it usually just made me more restless.\n\nThat bit about sitting there doing literally nothing hit. No phone, no planning, no trying to be efficient. Just letting the brain stop pushing back for a minute. I’ve noticed the same thing, when I force productivity my brain resists, but when I give it a short break it kind of resets on its own.\n\nI think a lot of us confuse movement with progress. Crossing things off feels good even if nothing meaningful is actually finished. Leaving small gaps in the day feels wrong at first, almost like you are slacking, but weirdly that’s when work starts flowing again.\n\nAlso relatable what you said about money and pressure. When there’s even a bit of financial breathing room, it is way easier to stop grinding every second just to feel safe. That constant background stress messes with focus more than people admit.\n\nCurious how many people here noticed the same thing once they stopped trying to optimise every minute. I write about this kind of stuff sometimes too, mostly because I spent years stuck in that loop.",

The act of creating a tangible list makes it more likely to stick around in your brain, and the visual cue keeps attention flowing to it. \n\nIf you're into planning and like sticking to schedules, you might look ahead at your course load for each week and set up post-class activities per day. Maybe schedule gaming or shows/movies for heavy academic days, and reading/writing for the light ones. \n\nYou might also automate task switching, if that works better with your brain. Set up automations with Shortcuts / equivalent, reminders, alarms, etc., that automatically transition you out of one \"focus mode\" to the next. This might look like having your home smart lighting change colors at a certain time, or setting up a shortcut that makes your computer go into airplane mode at 6 pm. \n\nThe key takeaway is to reduce the barrier of entry to the tasks you want to do! Self-discipline is often little more than good habits & structure.",

I've never gone to a café to just sit down without ordering anything, that would feel incredibly weird.\n\nSo personally I feel like it's both crowd/order based; if the place is packed and you don't order anything, you're taking up a spot from someone who would. If you order, say, an initial tea and cradle it for 3 hours but you're literally the only customer, you aren't taking anything away from anyone.

It’s not really about how long you’ve been there or how many drinks you’ve ordered, it’s about whether your presence is actually affecting anyone else.\n\nIf the cafe is quiet or half empty, nobody cares. You can sit there for hours on one coffee and you’re basically background noise. Staff usually do not mind because you are not stopping turnover and the space is not under pressure.\n\nOnce it starts filling up, that’s when it changes. If people are clearly looking for seats or you’ve got a laptop out during peak hours, that’s when staying too long starts to feel off. Not because you’re doing something wrong, but because space has become scarce.\n\nMy personal rule is just to read the room. Quiet cafe, stay as long as you want. Busy cafe, either order again or wrap things up soon. Chains are generally more tolerant than small independents too.\n\nMost of the awkwardness is just social awareness, not some hidden timer you’re breaking.\n\nI write a bit about working habits and productivity without overthinking everything.

Personally, I get distracted/focused very easily and can take a long time with one drink, regardless of whether I'm even working on something or if I'm just having a lot of thoughts. I also have a bunch of friends who have disorders that make it difficult to swallow or consume food quickly for other reasons. If we're still drinking our first coffee, would we be expected to reorder/get out before finishing that one?

Over here a lot of cafes give you 1 or 1.5 free work hours when you order a drink now and you have to pay if you want to work longer.

      "text": "ok so this started as a dumb experiment and turned into something that genuinely changed how my days feel.\n\nAbout a month ago I got frustrated because I kept running late in the mornings even though I swore my routine only took 45 minutes. Like, I KNEW it was 45 minutes. I’d done it a thousand times.\n\nSo I decided to actually time it. Every single step. For 30 days straight.\n\nDay 1 result: 1 hour 22 minutes.\n\nI was almost double what I thought. And honestly? That pissed me off enough to keep tracking.\n\nWhere the missing 37 minutes were hiding???\n\nThe biggest one was transition time. The gap between finishing one thing and actually starting the next. Like, I’d finish breakfast and then just… stand in the kitchen for a bit. Check my phone. Wander to the bathroom. Start getting dressed but realize I need to pick something out first.\n\nEach of those gaps was 3-7 minutes. Doesn’t sound like much but I had 6 of them in my morning. That’s 25-30 minutes of basically nothing.\n\nThe second thing was variance. Some tasks were super consistent — making coffee was always about 4 minutes, showering was always 10-12 minutes. But picking what to wear? Anywhere from 2 minutes to literally 18 minutes one day when I couldn’t find a clean shirt and then changed my mind twice.The high-variance stuff is what destroys your schedule. You can’t plan around something that takes anywhere from 2-18 minutes.\n\nThird thing: the “quick check” tax. Every morning I’d squeeze in like 4-5 “quick” things — check slack, reply to a text, look at the weather, scroll instagram for “one sec.” Each one was 2-3 minutes but I was doing it almost unconsciously. That’s another 10-15 minutes I never accounted for.\n\nWhat I actually changed:\n\nAfter seeing the data for a couple weeks, the fix was pretty obvious. I rebuilt my morning with honest times and a locked sequence:Wake up + stretch —5 min, Shower — 12 min,Get dressed (clothes picked the night before, this was the big one):3 mins,Breakfast, same thing every weekday, overnight oats — 8 min, look at my 3 priorities for today — 5 min,grab stuff and go — 7 min,Buffer because life happens — 5 min\n\nTotal: 45 minutes. But like, a REAL 45 minutes this time.\n\nI tried timing with my phone stopwatch for the first few days and it was annoying as hell. Tried Toggl but that felt too work-y for a morning routine. Tried a spreadsheet and lasted about 4 days before I stopped filling it in.\n\nWhat actually worked for me was a routine timer app — you set up the steps once and then just tap through them each morning. It shows you the full sequence as a visual timeline so you can see where you are and what’s coming. The thing that surprised me was having it on my Lock Screen. I just glance at my phone and see “step 4 of 7, 3 minutes left” without opening anything. It sounds small but it removed this constant “wait what am I supposed to do next” friction that I didn’t even realize I had. Not a magic wand I found to solve all my problems at once but definitely a significant jump wrt kind of solutions I found earlier.\n\nBiggest takeaway:\n\nWe are TERRIBLE at estimating how long our own routines take. Like embarrassingly bad. But once you have actual data, fixing the routine is almost easy. The problem was never motivation or discipline. It was just… bad information. I was building my entire morning around a number (45 min) that was completely fictional. Of course I was always running late.\n\nAnyway that’s it. Genuinely curious — has anyone else actually timed their routines like this? What was the gap between what you expected and what was real? I feel like this can’t just be me lol",

It's engaging in that it gamifies things and I want to be sure I'm checking off all my tasks for the day to keep my streak going.\n\nBeforehand, I wrote down everything I wanted to do and picked only the essential items to add to my Finch tasks. Otherwise, I know I'd get overwhelmed. Keeping it to a minimum helps make it more manageable. Then, only if feasible, I'll add more tasks one at a time. But I'm just trying to get by right now. I can't go all superhuman overnight; that'll never be sustainable.\n\nI will acknowledge that using the app is yet another thing to do on my list, and I just started using it, but I'm trying it for now.\n\nI think I reached a point where I realized that my lack of productivity had to change. I couldn't keep letting everything go and letting it pile up. I still don't want to do anything but I'm trying to force myself even when I just want to escape. And again, keeping it small for now is helping me feel like it's more possible to get a handle on everything. But really, wanting to keep my streak going is very motivating lol\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk!",

I always crash in fall and bounce back in spring, and my light therapy lamp has made it feel like it's spring in February.\n* Adderall. Whenever I feel like I have a lot of energy but I feel jittery or unfocused, more Adderall is usually the answer. For whatever reason it always makes me feel calm in those situations instead of amping me up more like you would expect with a stimulant.\n* Doing a better job of resting. Meditation, taking quality breaks, sleeping more, relaxing more etc. Maybe it's common sense, but I find the more well rested I am, the more relaxed I am, and the less pressure I put on myself the more I actually get done and the less I procrastinate.\n\nFor a few months I was getting very little done.

Also cut caffeine after 12 pm, it was masking exhaustion but making the crash worse. Took 2 months to feel normal, but it was the kindest path.",

      "text": "morning routines...., ah I like these 2 words which people usually using to describe what they perfect mornings look like, what they do in the mornings, etc. You know, these videos from Instagram people doing bunch of the stuff in the morning and u just look at this: what th is that? Like get up at 5am, сold water with ice, smear your face with a banana, etc.\n\nAll this is performative bs and survivorship bias. I don't know anynone in real life who actually doing all these bunch things in the mornings, lol.\n\nSo, let's start not from the morning, but before that -> your evenings. They matter exactly the same, even more than mornings. Think about what u doing before sleep? Watching something? Dinner?\n\nI found some things essential in the evenings, mostly time before sleep\n\n\\-> no phones at least 1 hour before sleep (you probably already heard about blue light) and it really breaks your sleep quality. Worse sleep = worse morning\n\n\\-> no dinner close to sleap like 3 hours (your body need to relax and actually be ready for the next day, not digest all things you eat before)\n\n\\-> I also found from personal experience that I need to avoid stress or sport just at the late evenings. Otherwise, I just can't fall asleep at least 30 minutes, it depends on the person overall, but Im that kind who thinks a lot\n\n\\-> Make your room between hot and cold, something like a bit less warm, open window and let your room fill with fresh air, comfortable sleep is the best\n\n\\-> plan your day ahead + go sleep at the same time, no more 1 more series at late night\n\noh, okay, that's already much in one post, so morning tips (i don't wanna make fluff here):\n\n\\-> wake at the same time, even in the weekends\n\n\\-> avoid scrolling at any price in the first 2 hours. What I found from myself -> open scrolling, even 10 minutes -> day feeling like a shit, can't do anything productive fr\n\n\\-> shower + meditation is one of the best combos I found. You first wake up -> no phone -> go to shower, while you drying out, meditation and thinking about what you gonna do this day, this literally helps me a lot\n\nThat's something like this, I could include more info but don't wanna look like a big damn article. Ofc you shouldn't follow all the rules, start small, adapt what works for you, Im just sharing what works for me. It would be also good idea to share what helped you in comments, so people can adapt your tips as well\n\nseee yaaaa",

I mainly use it on the weekends, and during my day, I don't know what to do. I sound a bit stupid right now, but I feel lost. I draw on my iPad all the time, but now that I'm trying to balance my screen time, when I'm not using it, I don't know what to do: read a book or do another activity. I've been doing word searches sometimes, but still. I would like to know if anyone has advice on how I'm feeling. I wanna stay productive, but I also wanna have some time to rest.",

That lost feeling is basically your brain going wait... we have free time and no one is telling us what to consume? It doesnt know what to do with itself because social media was filling every gap of boredom for years.\n\nAs an artist you actually have such a huge advantage here. Some ideas for your offline time:\n\n- Sketchbook work. Not on the iPad, actual pencil and paper. Its a totally different creative muscle and theres something about the tactile feel that hits different.\n\n- Go to a coffee shop or park and draw what you see. Observational drawing is insanely good for improving your art AND it gets you out of the house.\n\n- Physical movement. Doesnt have to be a gym thing. Walk, stretch, dance in your room. Your body has been sitting while scrolling for years and it needs to move.\n\n- Cook something new. Seriously. Following a recipe is productive, creative, and you eat at the end of it. Win win win.\n\n- Just sit and be bored. I know this sounds unhelpful but learning to be comfortable with silence and empty space is one of the most powerful things you can do. Thats where your best creative ideas will come from.\n\nThe fact that you dont know what to do without social media shows exactly why quitting was the right call. Give yourself grace - it takes about 2-3 weeks for your brain to stop looking for the quick dopamine hit and start finding joy in slower things.",

This is when I let my mind drift and do whatever comes to mind - dishes, planning for groceries, things that I've been putting off\n\n\\- I've also added a 30 minute workout goal, whenever I want to reach my phone, i asked myself, did I do my workout yet?\n\n\\- Overtime, I become more curious of some subjects and hobbies. I recently take up air dry clay and started learning art history with ChatGPT.\n\nHope this helps, and best of luck to you!",

So as for what you should do, indulging in other activities, you see, I would suggest that it depends on your goals, what you want to achieve, and then those goals turn into your daily actions to help you reach them. But if you want to spend your time in some better activities, I would suggest you start working on your body by doing some workouts and learning some new skills. Since you seem to be a creative fella, how about learning writing, editing, or graphic designing? Maybe that will work. You can try them as well, and like, watch something educational as well on any topic you're interested in, you always wanted to know about. \n\nAside from that, there are several activities you can do, like walking or spending time with yourself alone. Yeah, those boring breaks, just sitting with your own mind, understanding and hearing your own thoughts. Because most people don't do it, that's why we feel so conflicted most of the time or overwhelmed. You can try meditating. Believe me, it will help a lot. You will feel a lot better, both in your mood and energy. And look, no matter what you pick, you just have to set time, so much effortless and short for it at first, then gradually increase. Like meditating for 5 minutes, or you know what's even better? Setting challenges to do daily, like 50 push-ups or 100 push-ups. These are also best for you. You can do it with pull-ups as well, like whatever you want. I hope this will help. Peace.",

If you’re already drawing a lot on the iPad, that’s great, but when you’re not, don’t try to replace social media with something equally stimulating. That just turns into another screen habit. Some days I read, some days I just sit with music, some days I do nothing useful at all. That’s still rest.\n\nAlso, it’s okay if your days feel slower. You don’t need to fill every gap with productivity. A short walk, stretching, cleaning one small thing, flipping through an art book, even just staring out the window for ten minutes, that stuff matters more than it sounds. Boredom is usually where better ideas show up.\n\nYou’re not failing at balance. You’re just in the awkward in-between where your brain is relearning how to exist without constant input.

I only really use Reddit, but I don’t count it.\n\nmy time and productivity has improved significantly. at first, it was quite difficult as I’m a young adult, & also a business student. you soon realize little to no one cares about your life online, and neither should you about others. the active feeling of fomo is what makes social media so addictive. \n\nask yourself, why are you so compelled to go on X apps? I’m still improving with some apps (I frequent Pinterest fairly often), but whenever I feel like it’s useless consuming instead of intentional, I remind myself of other things I could be doing. tbh, I struggle with it less now that my academics have gotten a lot more intense where I don’t have spare time. \n\non my school breaks, almost every single day of summer/holiday break, I was constantly doing something hobby related. sewing, drawing, baking, etc. hanging out with people is fulfilling too. \n\nwhile there are so many things I’ve done in my pursuit of betterment, a large thing I’d suggest is journaling. I’ve been doing it more or less for the last seven years, but when I really began implementing it in my life consistently is when I noticed change. specifically an improvement journal, and a planner. when you write into action what you’d like to achieve, new things you’d like to try; it becomes more of a desire rather than a passing thought, and you are inclined to put it into action more instead of mindless social media scrolling.\n\nsorry for the long mumble jumble! hope this helps :)",

That doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong or that you’re suddenly unproductive. It just means you’re not being constantly fed noise anymore. It feels like boredom but it’s really your attention resetting.\n\nAs an artist especially, that gap matters. Creativity usually comes after boredom, not before it. Sitting there not knowing what to do, staring out the window, walking with no podcast on, doing something slightly pointless. That’s often when ideas show up later on, even if it doesn’t feel productive in the moment. Rest without stimulation still counts as rest.\n\nYou also don’t need to replace social media with something equally intense. Reading a few pages, sketching badly on purpose, cleaning one small thing, going for a short walk, then stopping. It’s fine if your days feel quieter and smaller for a while. You’re not wasting time, you’re learning how to be alone with your thoughts again.\n\nIf you’re interested, I write about attention, money, and modern life stuff like this from a very normal perspective.

This strategy would most likely resolve most of your motivation, emotion and enery problems as well as make life fun.\n\nGood on the gym. You are still young at 27. Can you create a goal to work towards also with your degree for motivation as well as the above social group support system method perhaps with other maths students?\n\nJoin some clubs where they do activities that help you forget about yiur work and get you out of your head also… can you think of some? Try to split room and sleep from study and work spaces if you can also and try to allocate time at each and not over do any of these either.\n\nGood luck and I am sure you will find a good way forwards.",

Therapy usually doensn’t work for two reasons.  \n\nThe first is that the client wasn’t ready to do the work required for change or had unrealistic expectations of therapy, usually believing the therapist has a magical quick fix solution. Something that is often said by therapists is that when clients first come to therapy, they only present with and share symptoms of much deeper issues.  This is something that may cause poor outcomes because the client is unwilling to explore the depth of their problems.\n\n  \nThe second reason is sometimes the therapist is simply not the right fit.  You can parallel this with a hairdresser.  If you go to the hairdresser for the first time and don’t like the cut, you may not return. However, that doesn’t mean you never get your haircut again.  Similarly, sometimes it comes down to finding the therapist that is the right fit.\n\n  \n",

Bed rotting for hours and days isn't time you lost, it really is time you spent to recover because you needed it. \n\nOne thing that really helped with the depression I went through (not saying you're depressed but I deeply was when my bedrotting was at its max) was to kinda \"worship\" myself in little everyday things : \n- whenever I make my bed, I consciously put care into creating a very cozy and safe space for myself, I really treat it like an act of love and care for my future self who loves to come back to a tidied up bed\n- after showering I apply body lotion and massage myself, sometimes even hug myself. Helps with being a bit more present in the body, sometimes I use that to reassure myself\n\nThe idea of \"worshiping\" was a way for me to respect myself and my needs more. Maybe you could find your ways around small gestures of selfcare (small enough so you can add them to your routine without it being a sudden change) ? \n\nShifting the way we see/understand/feel/think about the things around us (or inside us) is a great exercise and can do wonders.\n\nGetting help from professionals would be really great even though it is exhausting to find the right therapist. \n\nPlease OP don't be too harsh on yourself.

They ebb and flow, but your state sounds pretty severe and you sound very unhappy about it.\n\nOne small thing you could do even in bed or wherever is reflection/meditation/prayer (whatever suits you). Just reflect on your desire to do more and feel a lot of self-compassion around the desire versus the inability right now. Just conscious awareness of the problem, the genuine frustration, and knowing that you are in dostress over this. Be gentle though. It's a self-love exercise not an 'I should!' 'why can't I?' sort of thing.\n\nThe gym sounds like a positive. Just the other day after a bike ride I thought to myself 'i never regret this!' even though I had to push myself about 25 times to break through the resistance and actually get our there. It's real, and it's powerful. Don't ever let anyone tell you it's easy!\n\nhope you can find the help and solutions you need. Thanks for being brave enough to write this.

We host a 4-week 5 a.m. consistency bootcamp where we connect for just 15 minutes at 5 a.m. every day. We also bring in subject-matter experts who talk about different self-improvement topics.\n\nHere’s the catch—and this is what actually works:\n\nOnce you register, if you don’t show up at 5 a.m. the next day, you pay a penalty. That money goes straight into the prize pool.\n\nSo the system is simple: structure + support + real consequences.\n\nI agree, 5 a.m. isn’t for everyone. But if you genuinely want to push yourself and become your best version, this kind of setup can work surprisingly well.",

When you don't have the energy to do everything you set out do, you need to cut back somewhere.\n\nCritically assess everything in your life and assess if it's worth your time and energy. If not, replace it with passion project. If yes, you're already living the life you want so you should cut back on the scope of your passion project instead.\n\ne.g. I tried to balance a full time job as a researcher, gym every day, practice music, play in band, improve at chess, and do game-dev. Almost never got to work on my passion project. I decided to quit the band and do a full body workout 3.5 times a week and now I code every evening for an hour.",

All of a sudden I kept uncontrollably procrastinating and putting off work to doomscroll or watch tv. \n\nI struggled with procrastinating previously, but it had never been such a consistent and persistent issue to the point where it felt like I couldn’t overcome it.  This went on for basically the entirety of 2025. I’m trying to improve things and have done a bit better but there’s still an underlying problem that I just realized. I’m not sure how accurate this is, but it almost feels like someone swapped out the brain I’ve had all my life, for another one that has ADHD. \n\nI have all these goals and ambitions and I need to remain productive but then I just find myself fighting the urge to do literally anything else but the task at hand. It’s making me feel hopeless and really scared about how I am going to handle my life and responsibilities. I don’t want to throw away everything I’m working towards.\n\nI’ve never had this issue with being unable to focus before and have always been focused on remaining productive and was doing well at it.\n\nI don’t believe it’s me being burnt out because I wasn’t necessarily working myself to the bone before it happened.

Even if you weren't \"burnt out\" from work, you can be \"burnt out\" from stimulation.\n\nYour baseline dopamine is too low to \"start\" boring tasks, so try out 24 hours of zero digital input.  \nThen delete the doomscroll apps and use the web versions. They have a simpler design without so many triggers. (At least for a while to reset).  \nHigh-arousal content has re-wired your \"interest\" threshold. Practice doing nothing for 10 mins a day. (And this is hard tbh, but can be the best thing to help)\n\nFocus is a muscle that has atrophied because you stopped lifting \"heavy\" (deep, slow work) and started lifting \"air\" (quick, easy content).

What helped me was stopping the fight to “focus like I used to” and instead rebuilding structure from the ground up. short work blocks, fewer inputs, and removing the easy escape hatches mattered more than motivation.

It really does feel like your brain got swapped overnight and none of the old tricks work anymore.\n\nOne thing that helped was realising this doesn’t always mean ADHD out of nowhere. A lot of people hit a point where their brain just stops responding to pressure the way it used to. Stress, uncertainty, phone dopamine, life changes, all stack quietly. You don’t have to be worked to death to break your focus, sometimes it’s just too much low level noise for too long.\n\nWhat made it worse for me was fighting it constantly. Every day felt like a test I was failing. What helped a bit was switching from trying to focus, to trying to reduce resistance. Tiny starts. Five minutes. Open the doc, don’t write. Sit there. If nothing happens, fine. Weirdly that brought some control back.\n\nAlso doomscrolling isn’t laziness, it’s avoidance. Usually from fear of messing up something you actually care about.\n\nYou’re not broken and you’re not throwing your life away. You’re just in a phase where brute force stopped working, and that’s unsettling as hell.\n\nI write about this stuff from a normal perspective because I hit the same wall and most advice felt useless.

          "text": "don't just have goals, have minimums. like say your goal is to do 3 30 minute runs each week. maybe your minimum is 2 10 minute runs. \n\nalso as you live ask yourself, how much chaos does this add to my life? most people just pile it on until they break. think about how couples who have twins have a higher divorce rate--shouldn't be anything wrong with having twins but it's double the potential chaotic problems of a single baby, sometimes more because now one baby crying might wake up the other. the added stress causes something important to these people to break down because they had more chaos than they bargained for. and with twins that is one of the things that just happens sometimes. but you can also ask yourself, if i have no pets, how many random vet bills will i be getting if i get one? and if i have one pet and can handle it just fine, what about another? each one is a gamble. one pet might need nothing other than some food, a bed, and some toys, and the next one might need constant vet bills... maybe not even a problematic amount for you, but these problems won't care about their timing.\n\nalso learn to find your productivity to not just be a grind but relaxing. there might be some parts that are always work to you. but let's say you're an illustrator building a portfolio. some days you want to fully lock in, organize, design. but other days you might be completely drained. you can still get a pad and sketch while watching comfort movies.\n\nalso be willing to accept imperfect conditions, subpar tools. if you want to write every day, some days that will mean you get a coffee on a sunny walk through nature, feel inspired, and juuuust as you get home it starts to rain just like your moody gothic horror novel you're working on and it feels perfect and you wish every writing session could go like that. other days you might have to write on your phone while you're in line at the passport office while a baby is crying near you.\n\nBUT those days when everything sucks and you STILL do SOMETHING are so key. THEY are what tell you you mean business. When you want to go for a run and the weather is truly insurmountably terrible so you move some furniture around to give you space to do some calisthenics at home, THAT is how you know you can actually hit your goals. Let it be EXCITING to have to make things work and have your momentum challenged because when you push back just a little to keep moving forward, that little means a lot.\n\nalso try not to have systems that see one small failure as a complete failure. people who ascribe to streaks really have this problem--they feel great doing something for a week, 30 days, fifty days. then they miss ONE and instead of saying wow i have been hitting my target 98% of the time they go oh noooo my streak has ENDED! it's all over! give yourself some grace to miss some steps. \n\nalso when you fail: analyze. react. what can you do to prevent yourself from failing for the same reason again? learn from your mistake and think of it as a lesson, a strengthening, rather than a failure. \n\nalso: don't let your productivity systems ADD stress and more work. when you got to track and check a ton of stuff that interferes with just doing what you need to do. simplify your system to just one interface like one calendar app or a physical calendar or whatever works best for you.\n\nalso be willing to just admit you don't have the time or energy for certain goals right now and cut them--not in a sad way but a freeing way. don't let your number 7 life goal get in the way of your number 1-3 goals. \n\nplan for chaos. it's easy to set a bunch of goals and start acting on them when everything's good. we feel like we can become a Renaissance Man in January when there's nothing going on and we set these goals we want to do all year. then spring and summer hits and there's social obligations creeping up, maybe we are outdoors more and get injured, we socialize more so we get sick more, there's weddings, birthdays, etc. should we all feel like failures because we can't do in one hour of free time what we used to do when we had five hours a day free? no.\n\nso, don't be afraid to be 'greedy' when you DO have the time and energy. but think of those as bonus goals. maybe you CAN get into woodworking this year.... but that doesn't mean you'll do it every day. maybe you'll do it every day until the first day of spring, then it will be sunday mornings until October when you begin working on Christmas presents sunday mornings and wednesday evenings. \n\nAnd you still might need to be adaptable from there. But the point is your plan accounts for 'predictable chaos' and it is not a failure to reduce your output during these times because that is part of the plan.\n\nif we want to be extra from here we could do something kind of like sick days at work. We get twenty 'skip it' days per year but you have to physically track them to make it feel harder to cheat, like putting beads into a jar. Whether you intend to miss a day, or do it unintentionally, you MUST put a bead into the jar. something like this will help us really think: is my life actually chaotic and low-energy enough right now, or can I power through and save this \"sick day\" for something worse?",

I planned on cutting it off as its was feeding so much negativity to my head and add something else to fill that time. \n\nI wrap work around 7 PM and have dinner by 8 PM. I have about 7-8 hours after this for myself as I usually sleep late around 3-4 AM. My goal is to get to a point where I sleep by 12-1 at max, a topic for another day!\n\nI intended to use that time to upskill/work on side projects. My concern was that even with this 7-8 hours, I will be able to study for 2-3 hours at max as cognitive fatigue is real after work and few hours of study. I had no idea how was gonna fill the remaining \\~4 hours\n\n**How it turned out?**  \nOne week into this and the effects are massive. Surprisingly, negative too!!\n\n* I’ve been able to redcuce doom scrolling over the past week (Reddit, Twitter, etc) by \\~70–80%\n* I’m putting a few hours into studying after work. The issue is what comes after, once mental energy is depleted, anything cognitively demanding feels unrealistic so no space to dive into any hobby that is remotely demanding cognitively\n* **Loneliness kicked in** \\- Honestly, I didn't anticipate this to happen but in hindsight now I realize that  scrolling might be keeping my head occupied and making me avoid feeling lonely. I wasn't feeling like this before I started with this exercise a week back. The last \\~4h block that I refereed earlier is where I feel lonely which feels like a serious negative side effect of this at this point\n* Having said that, I’m optimistic this is temporary friction of me tapering myself down from doom scrolling. \n* Over the next few weeks, I plan to explore low effort, lighter activities that help unwind without reverting to doom scrolling or forcing productivity.\n\n\n\nCurious if others have experienced something similar and what helped?",

For you, that’s loneliness. A lot of people hit this phase and think something went wrong. It didn’t. You just took away a coping mechanism faster than you added a replacement.\n\nThat empty 3–4 hour block isn’t supposed to be productive. Treating it like it should be filled is what makes it heavier. After work + studying, your brain is done. That time is for low-stakes, low-pressure stuff. Loneliness doesn’t mean you need more people immediately. Sometimes it just means you need more presence. Things like walking outside with music, cooking slowly, journaling badly, watching one comfort show instead of endless clips. Stuff that keeps you company without frying your brain.\n\nAlso, some social input helps. Not deep conversations every night, just light human noise. A call with a friend once or twice a week, a gym class, Discord voice chat, even sitting in a café. Scrolling gave fake connection. You removed it, so your nervous system is like “hey, where did everyone go?” One important thing: don’t panic and reinstall doom scrolling to fix the loneliness. Sit with it a bit. This phase usually passes once your brain recalibrates and you build gentler evening rituals. You’re not regressing. This is what progress feels like when it’s not anesthetized.",

You’re listening, reacting, being “on,” reading tone, making decisions — that’s social and mental load at the same time. Of course your weekdays feel heavier than weekends. Nothing is wrong with you; your nervous system is just cooked by Thursday.\n\nWhat helps in seasons like this isn’t more discipline, it’s more gentle buffers during the day. Tiny moments where you’re not “on” for anyone — a short walk between calls, standing in the kitchen staring out the window with a drink, lying on the floor for five minutes after work, music in your headphones while doing something mindless. And one weekday evening that’s officially a low-effort night with zero expectations. Those little pressure valves are what keep busy lives feeling livable, not just manageable.",

Doesn't have to be earth shattering, but you'd be surprised that getting the blood flow going is super helpful for those long days.\n\nOn the days when I'm buried with calls, I alternate the meetings between standing and sitting for each call. Additionally if it's a teams call and I don't have to have my video camera on I take the meeting on my phone with ear buds and walk around my property.\n\nHalfway through the day around lunchtime, it's mandatory to go outside and get fresh air. This also helps my seasonal affect disorder.\n\nFinally at the end of the day I take a pad of paper and I write down all the things that I want to do first thing the next day or that's on my mind that way I can fall asleep faster.
