      "text": "I bought this glass cookie jar from Target for like $8 and now every time I finish something I write it on a small piece of paper and drop it in the jar.\n\nDoesn't matter if its a big thing or small, if I completed it it goes in. Replied to that annoying email? In the jar. Finally scheduled that dentist appointment I been putting off for 3 months? Jar. Finished a work project? You get it.\n\nThe thing is I realized my problem wasnt that I wasnt being productive, its that I have terrible memory for what I actually accomplished. My brain would just fixate on the 50 things I didnt do yet and completely ignore what I did finish. Now when im feeling like I got nothing done I can literally see this jar filling up over time and it actually helps me chill out.\n\nAlso theres something satisfying about the physical act of dropping the paper in there that hitting a checkbox on my phone never gave me. I had like $250 aside from Stаke that I wanted to invest into productivity stuff and was looking at like fancy planners and app subscriptions but this $8 jar ended up working way better than anything else I tried.\n\nWhen the jar gets full (happened once so far after like 2 months) I dump it out and read through everything which feels pretty good ngl\n\nAnyways just wanted to share cause most productivity stuff focuses on planning what to do but this helped me acknowledge what I already did which turned out to be what I actually needed",

But put me somewhere public or on a call where someone can see me working and suddenly my brain turns on. Tasks feel doable. Time moves.\n\nThat’s when it hit me my productivity isn’t internally driven. It’s performative. I’m motivated by being seen as productive not by the work itself. Without external accountability, my brain just stops initiating.\n\nWhat frustrates me is that most productivity advice assumes motivation comes from inside. Discipline, goals, passion, willpower. But for me none of that works without some form of social presence even passive.\n\nHow do people actually motivate themselves from an internal source? Is this something you can build or do some brains just need external structure to function?\n\nI’m trying to figure out whether this is a flaw I need to fix or just a reality I need to design my life around.\n\nHad a work from home day yesterday with zero meetings.

That's only some people, though- others only get a small benefit, or no benefit, and there's a correlation between ADHD and autism, so a chunk of the no-benefit people might just be autistic- and autism doesn't benefit from ADHD meds on its own, because instead of having the wrong levels of a neurotransmitter, they have the wrong amounts of certain receptors altogether (among other complex things).",

If that was your intention and you're heading towards that by scrolling then it's productive.\n\nReading is not productive without the intention behind it. It is just a more acceptable form of taking your time to than doom scrolling. If you're reading a book or Kindle because you've nothing to do towards your goals then it's not intentional and unproductive. In that you're not working towards something specific.\n\nIf you read with intention then it's productive. By that I mean you're reading to further your knowledge on  trichotomy then reading a book on it is productive and intentional.\n\nIf you're reading a fantasy novel that's number 35 in a series that you like without purpose then you are not intentional or productive. Reading to complete a book series could be seen as productive but it's something you often drift into without intention to do so.\n\nJust because you've done so many so far matters very little IMHO because you kind of reading doom scrolled to get to that \"nearly finished\" status.\n\nThat is why I see people saying they read with virtue but look on closely they are often binge reading a series. Isn't that not a bit like doomscrolling?\n\nOf course your opinion matters more. What you think that is. If you choose to scroll because you have spare time and don't or can't read, do hobbies, even more exercise, etc then do it without stressing about your choice. There's no certainty that reading, crafting or other hobbies are more productive or positive anyway.\n\nPS I'm waiting to drive two hours home from relatives. Everything is packed.

(The job is the remodeling of three floors of an old shopping center that is attached to an office hi-rise--e.g., the new Team-Based Classroom used to be Lord & Taylor and the new human-dissection lab used to be the food court.  The company for which I work is in the $5-10 million per year range but their production planning happens mostly in the project managers' heads.  I work directly for the owner--technically he's my project manager, but he's always busy running the company so I'm basically on my own.)\n\nNot to be rude, but it sounds like you aren't involved/have goals with something larger than yourself.  Advice I heard long ago was to get involved with something larger than yourself.\n\nFor instance, decide to learn a foreign language well enough to go visit there in a year or two.  Duolingo or Babel come to mind.  There's a foreign-language video site called LiñgöPie.  Scroll/watch that in the language you're learning and suddenly all your scrolling is productive. (I try to do this but am lazy and end up back at Netflix in my native language. But, new year, new habits.)\n\nAnother thing that I want to replace scroll-time with is learning a CAD program--FreeCAD, specifically. Teaching videos are on a YouTube channel called \"MangoJelly\". The software is free.  There's a lot to learn.  Or get involved with a charity: for instance, a group that tutors disadvantaged school-kids.  \n\nThese are all projects larger than yourself.  Obvs these are ideas out of my life, not yours.  Probably nothing here that interests you.  You need to find your own path.  You'll be fine. New year, new habits. \n\n:)",

Just think of all of your options (going for a walk, playing games, watching a show, listening to something etc.) and do whatever seems like it will be the most enjoyable for you.\n\nI'm not saying this applies to everyone, but what helps me with both of these things is meditation.

Without your parents forcing you to, without grades hovering at the end, without any external pressures.

Commonly called revenge bedtime procrastination, it’s a habit that’s intended to feel like you’re gaining control over SOME time in your day which really just robs you of your energy.

It’s hard but just know it’s common and not just you\n\nDo not fall into the “just wake up earlier” mindset as that’s not really acknowledging the issue and will just make you more tired as you’re likely to continue to habit AND try to wake up earlier",

We treat habits like chores on a to-do list, so our brains eventually rebel because chores are boring.\n\nThis year, I’m treating each month like a **'Seasonal Arc'** in a movie script.\n\nInstead of just saying 'I’ll gym every day in January,' I’m framing the month as the 'Physical Transformation' scene of my year. I’ve started writing my weekly reviews in the **past tense**—like a monologue of things I’ve already achieved.\n\nIt sounds subtle, but it shifts your identity from 'someone trying to build a habit' to 'the main character who already has that habit.' When the habit is part of your story, you don't need as much willpower to keep it.\n\nI'm dividing my year into 4 Acts (3 months each). One habit per month is great, but try giving each month a 'title' or a 'theme' first. It makes the grind feel a lot more legendary",

And when that happens, it makes it easier to reach goals.\n\nThat's likely why you fail all of your resolutions: you make goals that you try to achieve. But now, you're trying to focus on making better habits to automate completing goals.\n\nI highly recommend watching a book summary of Atomic Habits on Youtube.",

I used to feel kind of proud of that.\n\nThen recently a few deadlines got pushed back. Same job and same tasks just less immediate pressure. And all that “morning productivity” completely disappeared. No urgency, no drive and no focus. Just me staring at my to do list and not caring.\n\nIt was honestly unsettling to realize my work ethic seems to be fueled almost entirely by anxiety. Take away the fear of consequences and there’s nothing underneath it. No intrinsic motivation magically kicks in.\n\nI notice it in small moments now. I’ll sit down to work, feel that lack of pressure, get distracted almost immediately, end up playing a quick game on my phone instead and suddenly it’s noon. The contrast is hard to ignore.\n\nI don’t know what the solution is yet. I just know that calling this “productivity” feels wrong when it’s really just managed terror.\n\nCurious if anyone else has realized the same thing and if you’ve found a way to build motivation that isn’t just fear in a trench coat.",

So I logged all my requests with [app name] and\" etc.  \n\nI've noticed in so many of these posts/comments, if they slip in the name of an obscure app casually into their story and don't mention any other app names it's almost always someone trying to do covert marketing for their app.  \n\nAlso the account history is usually private for these accounts! This commenter's one wasn't though and me being a sad little loser on the internet had to snoop through and see a few other comments mentioning the same app.  \n\nSorry for the wall of text!",

I scrambled around with different jobs but it was all very unstable. About ten years later I had an idea that I thought would benefit gas stations, took it to Shell, and they liked it (they were, I think, benevolent to a young man trying his best). Things went fairly well. I bought some equipment and stuff on a loan (again I think I got points for being ballsy and with Shell on the contracts they went along). Then there was this big gas crisis thing, the contracts were cancelled. I paid the loans off, late, with money I scrounged up and the banker was pissed (I think he was put in a difficult situation by me). That was it, I was homeless. I wanted to withdraw from the world, found a very cool house which had been uninhabited for some time ( I was living in a house converted to a hay storage shed on the property beside it)- the lady was very sweet to me and wanted me to fix the place up. It was on 20 acres and about as remote as you could get. I took a job as a laborer on a construction site and started a garden and stuff. A few months later, I went and picked up my younger brother to show him the house but when we pulled up that evening, the house was gone, it had burned down while I was gone. The next day the engine blew in my van. I lost everything including an incredible coin collection I had built from the age of 8. All my clothes. Everything.\nIt was hard to bounce back after that. At about the age of 31 or so I decided I had to get into computers. I had never used a computer before so it was a tall undertaking. I interviewed with someone and called him every day for a month to see if they had made a decision. On the 30th day, I called him and upon being told they were still undecided, I told him I would show at 8:00 the next morning big and if he told me to go home, that’s what I would and not bother him any further. He told me to wear a suit and be prepared to work. I was employed to sell computer supplies and I learned all I could. Eventually, I worked elsewhere and saw a product I really like. I was the only salesperson that seemed fired up about and was selling it. The company offered to set me up as a distributor (age 36). I have sold millions of dollars of that and related products. I have done very well, but I haven’t forgotten what it is like to go hungry or live with rats in a shed. I have compassion for people having a tough time.",

Reading or drawing during these times just isn’t an option because I just cannot focus most of the time and my mind wanders and thinks about too many anxious or depressing thoughts. (I do have adhd). Also there’s people typically around and I can’t read a book while interacting with people if they need something.\n\nI genuinely just hate social media and the algorithm. I want to read interesting articles or play mind games or something that feels more meaningful and engaging but with purpose.

If you're interested in this, I can recommend some apps to teach you for each, but in general, if you haven't decided a path, codecademy, freecodecamp.org, and CS50 (Harvard? Course) have their own apps and/or YouTube channels\n\nDraw/do art (r/art, r/artreference, r/drawing, r/painting, r/digitalart, r/learntodraw, r/drawabox): this mainly consists of using YouTube tutorials, drawing apps, and reference image apps/websites. If interested, I can recommend **A LOT** of resources, in this post, it'd be a lot of bloat.\n\nLearn instrument/sing: my knowledge of apps and resources for this is significantly outdated, but I DO know that I USED TO be learning how to sing and play guitar with some decent apps for the time. It is definitely possible.\n\nWill continue in another comment",

Try and build small apps for yourself straight from your mobile.\n\nStarting out, almost everyone has similar ideas - expense tracker, workout scheduler, etc. Try building those, but make it good enough that YOU are willing to switch to it full time from whatever app you are using currently.\n\nOver time, you can build more complex apps, you will also learn more about software development, version control, technical terminology, what makes a good user experience (UX). Maybe you will even publish the app and get users. Maybe you'll end up earning a few dollars or maybe you'll end up earning many dollars.\n\nAnyway, it's fun, addictive, with lots of learning.\n\nPS: I say Replit because that is the only good vibe coding mobile app I know.

                  "text": "Sure I can. Well basically micro goals must be a part of your larger, long term goals. So for example, I was unable to concentrate on my studies last year, I am a student of post graduation in earth science so we need to read a lot but I didn't feel like, so what I did was that I made a micro goal that I'm just gonna read one paragraph which I easily did in 2 minutes. Now this goal is so embarrassingly small that it feels terrible to stop it there so with the little momentum I gained I ended up reading 5 pages, exceeding my micro goal of reading one paragraph.\n\n\nAnother example is when I was struggling to do pushups I couldn't even do a knee push up so I set a micro goal of doing one push up a day. Again, this was an embarassingly easy goal and so I didn't stop at one, I did 3 instead and that's how the momentum carried me ahead on other days too.\n\n\nOne thing you must understand is this system is designed keeping in mind your bad and average days, on your good days when you wake up motivated you will easily exceed every goal however on your bad and average days which are often more than the good ones, achieving your micro goals can take you a long way ahead.\n\n\nI hope this helps you.",

Then I would panic about how I wanted to do it, what containers I would use, which dirt to use, how many should I plant, and then it would never get done. One I separated it into two tasks: decide how to plant seeds and then plant seeds, it would actually get done.  Also along those lines is needing to plan for things like handwashing dishes. I have no counter space, so if I have a lot of handwashing to do, I need to have a table cleared off so they have somewhere to dry. I used to just blindly put handwash dishes on my to do list, then get mad at myself when it wasn’t done even though there was no way for me to do it. Now I know to not put handwash dishes on the to do list for the day if the table is being used for a different project and can’t be cleared off that day.",

                  "text": "There are many approaches to journaling. With gratitude journaling, some like to begin their day by writing what they are grateful for. \n\nThrough stoic journaling, one may write about anticipated challenges for the day and how they will handle them. They will reframe their mind to prepare for the circumstances of their life they have to face. \n\nStream of consciousness journaling allows you to begin writing with no intention, and to allow the words to form of their own accord. This often results in expressions of repressed or buried ideas. \n\nReflective journaling is when you journal during critical or difficult moments of life, processing your emotions and how you’d like to handle the difficulties. This is separate from stoic journaling in that you’re not limited to adhering to a specific philosophy in your approach. \n\nPersonally, I think it is practical to have separate journals for your separate needs. I have two journals. In one journal, I write about the stoic approach to life after reading stoic works. In another journal, I allow for stream of consciousness and I go further into depth with my feelings or whatever random thoughts I may have at the time. \n\nI recommend contemplating what style of journaling may be practical to your life and considering having separate journals for your differing needs. It prompts you to write more and lets you revisit specific thoughts or periods of your life whenever they are relevant once again.",

Sift them in other stuff so they're \"just another thing you can do.\"\n\nA couple simple tweaks have, over the last month, really done some interesting things to my peace of mind as far as \"productivity psychosis.\"\n\n1) Start the day with buckets and buckets of things to do. Caveat:  You're not gonna do 'em all.  You're not going to do most of them.  Hell, you might not do two of them.  But here's a good list to start with.  Trick is to keep it \"silly\" so the anxiety doesn't take hold too badly.  Keep them cross-domain (dishes, sewing, writing, reading, go out to lunch someplace new) so it doesn't turn in to \"the same old list of pinterest level nonsense.\"\n\nDon't treat it as a todo list.  Just something tickles the \"ooh, I could bang that out\" circuit.\n\nWhen the list gets boring and you don't really even see it anymore, nuke it.  Start again.  Maybe there's 85% overlap. \n\n(Advanced mode:  Keep old lists.  Check them out from time to time to see what stays important, what keeps coming up, and what you actually get done.)\n\n2)  Remember, when you're worrying about wasting time, that \"progress in anything is progress everywhere\" after a fashion.  The \"feel good\" of doing a couple dishes carries over to sitting down to be creative.  You don't have to keep your muse tied in the basement with a gun to her head.  \n\nWriter's block? (not a real thing btw.)  Go do something else to get some \"I got some I'm good points\" then go sit down again, having tweaked your head a bit.\n\nBonus:  If you don't know what to do \"Sitting down and figuring out what to do\" is exactly \"what you should do.\"\n\n(there's also buckets of \"make sure you break down everything in to atomic tasks\" level advice that permeates this sub.)",

Unless there's an emergency, I don't check my phone until after I've had my morning coffee, which is about 20 minutes after I've woken up.\n\n2. Gratitude journal. I used to think this was super cheesy, but writing one good thing about my life each day has honestly made me appreciate my life a lot more. Journalling in general is great. \n\n3. Cleaning as you go. Just put things away once you're done. It take 5-10 minutes to clean up after yourself and you won't be overwhelmed when you need to clean the house.\n\n4. Do the thing immediately. Don't put it off for tomorrow if it's a task that just takes 5 minutes to complete. No matter how tired you are, put the dishes away, take a look at the route you're travelling before bed, lay out your clothes the day before, pack your bag ahead of time.",

It’s about confronting your self sabotaging behaviours and creating internal resilience. I like it best because of the way it’s written: the author manages to gently confront you, like rubbing your arm to wake you from a deep sleep. I made so many bookmarks in my audiobook of this one.",

It’s thought-provoking and packed with insights, has beautiful infographics created by the author, and it encourages a new perspective that is counter to some of the more popular or traditional narratives of happiness. Moreover, the book is deeply grounded in research, and it provides simple applications in the real world.\n\nJoyful “explores how the seemingly mundane spaces and objects we interact with every day have surprising and powerful effects on our mood. Drawing on insights from neuroscience and psychology, she explains why one setting makes us feel anxious or competitive, while another fosters acceptance and delight—and, most importantly, she reveals how we can harness the power of our surroundings to live fuller, healthier, and truly joyful lives.”\n\nIt helps you look at your surroundings with more of an eye toward finding joy. A nudge to “notice” and make small changes that can produce positive outcomes in our environment. Where a lot of books and teachings point us inward, this one reminds us that the outside world does have influence on us, and what we can change there can make a difference.\n\nEnjoy! 📚",

Along the way, it teaches countless lessons about purpose, faith, and listening to your heart. The ending gave me goosebumps and genuinely changed how I see my own life. It’s my favorite book.\n\nThe Courage to Be Disliked is very different in its structure. It follows a dialogue between a young man and a philosopher and explores psychological and philosophical ideas, mainly based on Adlerian psychology. The book teaches that letting go of the desire to be liked or accepted is essential because you are not responsible for others’ expectations or feelings. You give meaning to your own life, and you are in control of your circumstances based on the meaning you assign to them. For example, the book argues that childhood trauma is not the direct cause of social anxiety or low self-esteem; rather, people may use it as a reason to avoid change. In other words, if you truly wanted to change, you would and choosing not to change is still a choice.\n\nI highly recommend both!",

With some accountability to make it be a bit stronger. don't want to go too much into it to not spoil your own discoveries from habit forming.\n\nFor me the biggest issue isn't what to do or how because that's clear after reading 5/10/20 different books. But how to continue after life happened and I stopped the habit for any reason.\n\n So what I got at the time I had the book (you might get some other insights, share them when that time comes), is when you are breaking down what you need to do before the day/week starts or even writing a sentence at the end of the day about why you did or didn't do something it's easier to jump back after you missed a few sessions or weeks (because life can be overwhelming at times) I would just go into my journal and check what was the cause behind my consistency break and solve it (if I'm lucky) or learn that it's there and continue (not start again) towards my goal knowing that the issue is there. And once the same break is about to happen again remind myself that this is why I want to stop (and sometimes that helps (at least me))\n\nApologies for the long rumbling.\nLoving this person",

The afternoon is spent reviewing and helping with homework, then I make dinner for the family, then depending on evening plans we have kids activities or choir practice (I’m in a community choir) or spending time together. The kids bedtime is 8:30 currently which then leaves an hour or two for my wife and I to be together. Often it’s that period when I exercise and shower\n\nEdit: I do have a separate bedroom in our house that I use for my work space. I “go to work” each day and the physical space separation helps.",

I've been saying the same things for like five years.\n\nAnd I realized \"I'm going to\" is just a comfortable lie I tell myself and others. Makes me feel like I'm moving toward something without having to actually move. I get to keep the identity of someone with plans and ambitions without the discomfort of attempting them.\n\nIt's safer that way. Because if you never actually try, you never have to face whether you're capable or not. The dream stays perfect in your head.\n\nI don't have a solution to this or anything. I'm still figuring it out. But now when I catch myself saying \"I'm going to\" I stop and ask if I actually am or if I'm just performing intention.\nMost of the time it's performing.\n\nAnd maybe that's okay for some things. Not everything needs to be acted on. But I think I owe it to myself to be honest about what I'm actually doing versus what I'm just saying to feel better.\n\nWords are cheap.

I'm not mad about it at all. I was really just happy to be getting up sooner. This made me realize that maybe I'm not the person who gets out of bed and goes straight into go mode. Maybe just making my bed and then chilling for 30 minutes is better for me. Does anyone else just take time to chill and wake up in the morning before starting their day?

Do you do the online course every day, including the weekends? Maybe optimizing these parts out, you can have couple of days of the week where you have 1.5 hours of free time that you can just relax.

Your hands shuffle, while your mind plays chess and studies.\n\n Combining chess, shuffling, and studying will save you an 1 1/2 hours. You can also combine relaxing, playing games with friend saving some more time. \n\nYou can save an easy 4 hours a day combining things, even more if you can workout or study at work, maybe taking a leisurely walk also?

      "text": "For a long time I treated productivity as an external problem. Better task managers, cleaner calendars, stricter routines. I’ve tried most of them. GTD, time blocking, Notion setups that looked great for about a week, and then quietly fell apart.\n\nWhat finally shifted things for me wasn’t another system, but realizing how much my output depended on my internal state before I even touched a task.\n\nThere were days where the same to-do list felt effortless, and others where every small thing felt heavy. I used to interpret that as discipline problems. Over time it became clear that it was more about unacknowledged stress, low-grade anxiety, or mental fatigue that I was pushing through without noticing.\n\nBooks like _Deep Work_ and _Four Thousand Weeks_ helped me intellectually understand this, but knowing it and acting on it were two different things. Meditation helped to some extent. I used apps like Insight Timer and Calm on and off. They were useful for building awareness, but I often struggled to translate that awareness into day-to-day decisions.\n\nWhat started helping was building a habit of checking in before trying to be productive. Not in a formal way. Just pausing and asking myself what’s actually going on right now. Am I scattered, tense, avoiding something, or just tired. Sometimes journaling helped. Sometimes a short guided session did. Lately I’ve also been using an app called Thinking Me in those moments, mostly because it lets me articulate what I’m feeling instead of forcing myself into a predefined exercise.\n\nThe practical effect surprised me. I don’t necessarily work longer or harder. I abandon tasks earlier when my state is wrong, and return to them later with less friction. Counterintuitively, that has increased my overall output.\n\nProductivity for me stopped being about optimization and started being about timing and honesty. Doing the right thing at the wrong mental moment is still the wrong thing.\n\nCurious if others here have noticed something similar. Not tools specifically, but the idea that productivity issues often start before the task even begins.",

You've put into words something that I would not have been able to define, but you're so right.\n\nI have daily struggles with anxiety, motivation, mood, executive function, etc, and what you've said here has hit home so strongly! I have days where life is a breeze, but then others when the simplest task is just impossible. I've tried different apps, methods, etc & nothing seems to work. \n\nMy struggles are much worse at home than at work, and I've never really understood that. But at work I'm also a lot more in tune with myself internally. I've had days where I knew I wouldn't be able to cope with much so I've made allowances for it, turn my phone off, don't take calls, just do simple, mindless jobs & that seems to work. \n\nI've never really thought much about it, but it's very much what you've said here, it's my internal state that drives how well I function, not the actual task at hand, because I change it to suit my frame of mind. \n\nThere's always something that needs doing, I just make much more mindful choices about what task to take on each day at work. When I'm at home I float from task to task, nothing gets finished & I constantly feel like a failure.\n\nI'm going to really think about this, like a lot. If I can take the strategies that I use at work & apply them at home then maybe I can start to achieve some things here without killing my husband & kids in the process.\n\nThank you, @Fit_Guidance2029.

I'd be working on something, get an email notification, check that, remember I needed to look something up, open a new tab, see an article I bookmarked last week, start reading that, then realize I forgot what I was originally doing.\n\nBy the end of the day I had 23 tabs open across two browser windows and couldn't tell you what half of them were for. Some were job postings I wanted to apply to later, some were articles for a project I'm working on, some were just random stuff I don't even remember opening. I know some of them were important but I have no idea which ones anymore.\n\nI'm starting to think having everything open \"just in case\" is making me less productive instead of more. But if I close stuff I'm afraid I'll forget about it completely, especially the job postings since I'm actively searching right now.\n\nHow do you deal with this? Do you just force yourself to close everything and trust you'll remember? Or is there some system that actually works for keeping track without drowning in open tabs?",

          "text": "1) Some browsers allow you to make tab groups. You can collapse the group out of the way when you don’t need it (keeps you from opening a random tab and getting distracted), and then expand them when you want to see them. \n\n2) I turned off my email notifications at work specifically because it would cause me to get distracted and switch tasks. I have my Outlook window open anyway, so the email notifications aren’t necessary. I check my emails manually when it’s convenient for me, rather than as soon as an email comes in. \n\n3) Have a pad of paper, a Word document/email, or a mini desktop whiteboard within reach at all times, and when you remember that you have to look something up, note that thing down. Noting it down keeps you from feeling like you have to hold it in your mind or deal with it immediately to avoid forgetting. Set aside time at the end of the day, or after finishing your current task, to do the things on the paper. \n\n4) There is no such thing as doing something quickly. Like “I’ll just quickly respond to this email,” or “I’ll just quickly look something up.” It’s never quick, because you have to context switch. If you think to yourself “I’ll just [do whatever] quickly and get it out of the way,” write it down on your notepad/whiteboard/Word document/email instead and get to it during its designated time slot. \n\n5) At some point, go through your tabs. First go through them and just close the ones you don’t need. DO NOT do anything other than “do I still need this?” And then click the X if you don’t. Then go through and see what’s left. Set reminders for things you want to do (ex. Set an alarm for Tuesday at 6:00 PM to complete a job application).  Once you’re done the task related to the tab, the last step should be closing the tab. Once the alarm goes off, either do the thing, snooze the alarm if you need a few minutes before you get to it, or re-set the alarm for a later time when you can actually do the thing.",

He’s based his productivity theories from commercial kitchens and their operating systems…long story short, definitely worth a read and for me it completely changed how I now approach things. So basically, now I’ll do a job (using work as my example) and once completed, I’ll close everything on my computer. If it’s been a long task, I’ll actually reboot. Then I’ll get a cloth and physically tidy and wipe my desk, fill up my water bottle, and then freshly start my next task. It’s like a reset of not only your physical space but a mind reset. Having that 3 minute clean up has made a massive difference and has allowed me to focus on the specific task at hand.",

Just a simple solution to this is - pick 1 thing to work, allocate time(this is the main thing) and then do according to time. Basically one needs to know about time and what we do at that time. Its overwhelming at the beginning lots of tabs and feels like nothing being done, but thats the only way to go. Just get used to it and have no gaps in days. You will figure it out on self.

Outside of that scheduled time, have your email minimized to avoid taking peeks to see if anything popped in. \n\n2. Start your day with a prioritized list of what needs to be done. Have a calendar event to block this time daily for the quick 15 minutes to do this. \n\n3. New ideas, notifications, and distractions will always pop up. Get into the habit of making a \"parking lot\" (paper or electronic list) of all items that are outside the scope of your planned list.\n\n4. The end of the day reflect on what was and wasn't accomplished. Crossing things off gives you a good feeling that you were productive, so this gives you a drive during the day to keep chugging along. \n\n5. Next morning, review yesterdays list and the parking lot and add to the list the things you want to accomplish that day. \n\n6. To avoid side tracking, add placeholders in your calendar as to what tasks you will work on when. \n\nThere are more things you can do (chunking, prioritization matrix, etc.), but this should be a good first step. Don't make it too complicated, or else the 'work' of implementing the system will demotivate you from executing it.",

Make each desktop specific for a type of work, complete with your Chrome task-specific profile.

Then when you're done you can switch back to the original desktop and it's right where you left it so you're not hunting for the original tab.",

Job postings have deadlines and actually matter, so those deserve a real system, not just \"I'll leave this tab open and hope I remember.\"\n\n\n\nFor everything else - the random articles, the \"I should look into this later\" stuff - I started asking myself \"would I actually be upset if I never saw this again?\" and like 90% of the time the answer is no. Close it. If it was really important it'll come back up.\n\n\n\nAlso turning off email notifications changed my life. Check email at specific times instead of every time something comes in.

Your brain sees them as memory, but they just compete for your attention.\n\nWhat's helped us is separating what we're working on from what we want to remember.\n\nHere's a simple rule that works well:\n\n●  If you're using it now, keep the tab open.\n●  If it's important but not urgent, save it in a doc, notes app, or task list.\n●   If it's interesting, bookmark or save it and close the tab.\n\nThe trick is to trust one place to store things instead of a bunch of tabs.\n\nFor job searching, grouping posts works better now. Collect the links and notes, close everything, and review it later with a clear mind.\n\nClosing tabs isn't losing info, it's choosing when to think about all that data. Making that choice reduces mental clutter.",

Quick capture somewhere (notes app, text file, whatever) - if you see something potentially useful, dump the link there with 2-3 words about why. Then close it immediately.\n\n2. Batch similar tasks. All the job applications in one focused session, research in another. Mixing them is where context switching kills you.\n\n3. Accept that you'll forget some stuff and it's fine. If it was truly important, it'll come back around.\n\nThe 23 tabs thing isn't really about memory - it's about not trusting yourself to refind things.

Delete Reddit, dont use safari for IG keep those on your PC(I would delete IG entirely tbh). When you only use them on your PC I found that it helps you stay on the productive end of using them, also helps you be more present because there not always on hand\n\n3.

          "text": "Considering which phone you have, Android phones (at least samaung from my experience) tend to count actual time on phone, like how long app was open etc, while iphone also calculates idle time, like if you were on a phone call, had unlocked phone on home screen and didn’t turn it off. Those little stuff that often done eat up a lot of time. I remember when I switched between phones, I was like 4 hours average (from 8) on samsung phone, and suddenly I was at 6 hours on iphone, but I had even less apps and did everything the same. Then I noticed how time counting works. \n\nIronically cutting out instagram helped me the most. That was average of 2-3 hours daily eating up my time. And not intentional, but when feeling bored opening up phone just to see quickly what’s up and then for half an hour scroll on instagram. Just a quick peek turned into doomscroll ritual. Consider that every app is commitment you need to put in your 24 hours of life. For example for me time blocking never worked, so can’t say that’s best solution. Both the app blockers and actual time blocking for socials and games that is. But consider making using apps only inside of routines. And don’t obsess over numbers much, as long as you know how much time you dedicate to each app, and you are within that time limit, it’s good. Rest is up to you which apps to cut. My advice is to get off any socials if you want lower screen time. But you do you",

          "text": "First of all, I feel like this is a daily struggle for many people in their 20s, so don’t feel bad. These apps were made to be addictive. But I think there are a couple effective strategies. First just getting a phone that completely takes out any instant dopamine time wasters like a dumb phone. One that has essentials that don’t consume all your time like Google Maps, Spotify, etc.. but don’t have social media apps. I never tried that but I have friends that sware by it. But sometimes I feel like going to that extreme makes it a lot easier to relapse and go back to your original phone. Then the other option which I think is easier and work better is to make your experience on your phone as boring and annoying as possible. Downloading apps like one sec that makes you wait before opening an app. Turning your screen grey. Things like that. But this by itself won’t fix your issue. What really worked for me was finding things in my life to do that were interesting and motivating me. Being more social, spending more time with friends, signing up for running races so I had to train more, working on starting a business, reading books, playing guitar and the list goes on. Find things that you really love to do and help you become a better person, and then when you are on your phone brain rotting you will genuinely feel guilty about it.

If you are in a dorm, maybe you can just put your phone in a drawer or closet. It can be really difficult to manage, but I wouldn't want a flip phone because things like Uber are a must have for me now.",

By this I mean:\n\n- Disable fingerprint unlock\n- Disable face unlock\n- Use a password instead of a 4-digit pin\n\nBefore you know it, you'll start to avoid unlocking your phone if you don't need to, just to avoid having to input a 12 characters or something password (bonus: use numbers and special characters in your password too).

I recommend setting up different \"modes\" and schedules in the Brick app. For example, I set up a \"no social media\" mode that is automatically scheduled for weekday mornings. I have a \"deep focus\" mode (no social media, no games, no shopping apps, etc.) that I use as needed. In addition to blocking apps, you can block websites in your browsers (so you can't access Instagram or other sites through safari). Regularly using Brick has also helped decrease my urge to scroll even when my phone isn't in Brick mode. Absolutely worth the $60 for me. Just make sure you use it.",

The case could be heavy, large, weird fabric, embarrassing, etc. anything that makes you not want to interact with it as much. The idea is to break the cycle of the phone being part of you and on your person at all times. I realized that if it didn’t fit in my pocket, I didn’t bring it with me everywhere. Now I’m walking around the house and my phone is somewhere in my room and I’m in the kitchen phone-free - small moments of progress to break the habit of reaching for it all the time. When I leave the house it is in my bag not my pocket - less easy to access. I am holding it less in general. Scrolling becomes inconvenient. I am choosing to interact with my phone instead of autopilot interacting with my phone. \n\nIf I’m traveling or something where I need my phone more regularly, I temporarily put on a normal case again to make life easier. But I know that I have the choice to interact with my phone the way I do with other devices in my life like my laptop or tv, I consciously decide when I want to use those things, and I want my phone to feel like that too.

That's definitely not productive for me.\n\nIn my ideal schedule, after waking up at 3:00, I'd start work right away (I'm a content writer) until 5:00, then do my daily run (7-10km), shower, have breakfast, and do other morning stuff before starting work again at 8:00. So yeah, waking up and immediately grabbing my phone is a bad idea, at least based on my habits.\n\nI've read somewhere that checking your phone first thing can mess with your focus for the rest of the day, but I don't know if that's true for everyone. For me though, the real issue is that I can't just check one thing and put it down. Once I start scrolling, it's hard to stop, and then my whole morning routine gets derailed.",

Planning, lists, tutorials all feel productive because they avoid that uncomfortable first step. Once I’m in, I’m fine!\n\nA few things that genuinely help me with this start resistance:\n\n\\- Lower the start bar to something almost stupidly small. something like \"open the document”, “write one sentence”, “run the script once”. This makes getting started a little easier.\n\nSeparate starting from continuing. I’ll often tell myself I’m only have to work for 5–10 minutes. Knowing I can stop removes a lot of resistance. Most of the time I keep going anyway, but the permission to stop is key.\n\nUse external triggers instead of relying on willpower. Timers work better than motivation. So does having something prompt you rather than deciding internally every time.\n\nTools that help me specifically:  \n– Forest: good for committing to a short focus block without overthinking  \n– Todoist (or similar), but only if you limit yourself to 1–3 tasks max  \n– SprintBuddy: a Telegram bot I use that sends one tiny 5-minute task per day. It teaches you how to study, be more productive, and set goals.\n\ndon’t aim to be productive, just aim to start! hope this helps!",

          "text": "Look, if you want to overcome that suck factor of starting a task, I would suggest you first of all make your tasks crystal clear from start to bottom to the end. Why is that? Because when your mind knows why you're doing it in the first place, what's the urgency, cost, benefits, plus when you know for how much time you'll do the task, for example it's 30 minutes or 60 minutes, and where will you do it? At your room, bed, or desk? Everything must be clear. Plus, you should know how your \"done\" will actually look like in each task, because without an end point, just starting, you may find it less interesting and less serious. Therefore, I would say clear everything in detail for yourself. Write the \"why\" in detail, why you're doing it in the first place. Plus, dive deeper, not only this much surface, but dive more deeper. And the second thing you should do in order to remove resistance is simply focus on task time rather than day time. Look, I've seen everyone, even me in the past, used to make this mistake of thinking that I got so much time left in the day, I'll do it then or later. But if you keep doing it, the resistance becomes even stronger. That's why just focus on the task time. How much time will this actually take? Like half an hour or just 1 hour, that's it? After doing it, you'll still have the whole time left in the day without any problem. So just do that. Focus on task time, how much time will it take, and just do it. The main thing I would say which can beat this resistance more better is having a strong why, as I said. So follow it. You'll make mistakes, it's fine, but constant practice will make you do this perfectly. Good luck. Peace.",

My attention span is very short—I can usually only focus on a task, read a book, or even meditate for about a minute before my mind wanders.\n\nI’m also a gamer. Currently, I’m playing *Raid: Shadow Legends*. For those who don't know, it has a lot of activities that require you to click every 1-5 seconds to auto-play. The problem is that this mechanic completely fragments my attention. For example, if I watch a 10-minute You-Tube video, I’ll get distracted 10 times just to click \"auto\" in the game. Cruelly, this distraction is reinforced because I get rewarded in-game for doing it.\n\nContinuing to play makes it nearly impossible to train my focus, which is crucial for my performance at work. However, the thought of quitting makes me feel incredibly empty—like life lacks meaning without it. I feel like I’d have to change my core nature and a part of my identity just to adapt to \"adult life.\"\n\nI also feel weak for not being able to balance both: satisfying my hobby (online gaming/collecting) while achieving success in my career.\n\nWhat should I do? Has anyone else dealt with this specific type of \"auto-play\" distraction?",

You can play it as much or as little as you want. \n\nAnyway, i think there's lots of ways to get around this problem but i think the two things you know for sure is it requires change of some kind and it is possible.",

          "text": "I game daily, but that’s because gaming daily helps me to be more productive not less productive. I only play games that don’t have time constraints. Every morning I play one day in a game while eating my breakfast, and then I do something productive. I might play a second day, but only after completing one chore or important task. Then at night to wind down before bed I often play another day in my game. I also have games I can play that are easy for me to get up in the middle of because nothing happens when I’m not pushing buttons. This means if I have downtime I can start a game, leave it to cook a meal, and then pick it back up to finish playing while I’m eating and I won’t miss a single thing. \n\nYou don’t have to give up gaming, you just need to choose games that work well with the life you need to live instead of games that make your life difficult.",

You need to treat it like what it is. There are actual resources for gaming addiction—support groups, therapists who specialize in it, even subreddits like r/StopGaming full of people who've been exactly where you are.\n\nYou're not weak for struggling with this.

Doing a dopamine detox is the cure, not a band-aid solution, because it will rewire your brain to be able to focus again, have the ability to do hard things, and ultimately enjoy more out of life. However, doing a dopamine detox can be incredibly hard with no experience. So as I said, I would love to help you with that because. Just message me if you want any help.",

          "text": "Not to belabor the obvious, but have you been assessed for ADHD or the like?\n\nIf your attention span really is that short, even for tasks that you know need doing, maybe it's more of a medical condition, and not a personal weakness? It may be less of a \"ditch the things that distract you\" type thing, and more of a cognitive therapy/medication issue. It is entirely possible that the reason you've been struggling with what feels like gaming addiction is more of a symptom of an undiagnosed learning/behavior disability than an actual personal failure in your part. I know it can feel like a cop out and a bit taboo to say \"it's not my fault, I'm just wired a little differently, so I need medication/therapy\" but I would not rule it out.\n\nI mean, distractions are real, and they do happen, but if you know they always happen, and that they get in the way of things you feel are important, maybe a checkup would be helpful, if for no other reason than to know for sure? Sometimes things that you feel are normal for you, are really not that normal for everyone else.\n\nTo use myself as an example:  \nI used to fail at college, falling asleep in classes and the like. I did not party, and went to bed early, and woke up at a reasonable time. I used to think maybe classes were really boring, and that I was just losing interest on what I was being taught, and that maybe that was why I wasn't doing well.  \nIt wasn't until much later (10+ years) that I learned I was suffering from sleep apnea and barely sleeping at all at night. I got that treated, have gone back to college and am currently maintaining a 3.8 GPA.\n\nSo, if you are really struggling, I'd suggest at least getting a screening done, in case it isn't just a simple issue of you having a temporary distraction getting on the way. You might discover that your life significantly improves from having figured out what was really going on in your life, in all kinds of ways. It may be that you don't need to stop enjoying gaming, or have your career take a hit because of it, but instead you just need the proper treatment to be able to do both successfully.",

That empty feeling when you think about quitting isn’t your identity disappearing… it’s withdrawal, and it does pass.\n\nThis probably isn’t about “balance” yet. You can’t rebuild focus while something is actively training distraction, especially auto-play games. That doesn’t mean quitting gaming forever, but it may mean stepping away from this type of game for a while.\n\nIf this kind of distractibility has always been there -school, reading, work - it might be worth looking into ADHD, not as a label, just as an explanation that changes what tools actually work.\n\nThe real question isn’t why you can’t handle both. It’s what you’re training your brain to do every day.",

Art hobbies on the other hand drain my focus in minutes because I don’t have as developed networks for that domain.\n\nI don’t think your gaming habit has much if at all to do with focus problems in other domains. Unless of course gaming addiction is pulling you away from other tasks. \n\nYour work is mentally very challenging, so naturally that’s going to quickly deplete your ability to focus, no matter how motivated and interested you are.

Tell your doctor as they might want to test something again or run an additional test if your symptoms are not getting better. ",

What to eat, when to check my phone, whether to respond to that text now or later.\n\nBy day three I noticed something. I'm not actually making most of my decisions. I'm just repeating the same patterns on autopilot.\n\nSame breakfast because it's there. Check phone because I'm bored. Open Twitter because that's what my thumb does. Order the same lunch. Avoid the same tasks. It's like I'm running a script I didn't write.\n\nThe decisions I think I'm making? Already made weeks or months ago. I'm just executing them over and over without realizing it.\n\nWhat's creepy is how much of my day is just unconscious repetition. Maybe 80% of what I do isn't chosen in the moment, it's just habit momentum carrying me forward.\n\nBeen documenting which decisions are actually conscious versus which ones are just autopilot. The ratio is worse than I thought and it's making me rethink a lot about how much control I actually have over my days.\n\nStill figuring out what to do with this information. But it's been eye-opening in an uncomfortable way.",

Making decisions drains willpower, after all, so if it's possible to autopilot a part of the day, your brain will opt for it. While it might sound creepy if you were unaware it was happening, it is actually pretty normal. \n\nHow you can use this information is to, gradually, replace the automatic decisions you don't like with ones you do. Make the things you want to do on autopilot easy, and the ones you don't like difficult.",

          "text": "This is totally normal. I understand why it’s disturbing to find out and it’s also normal to think of it like “autopilot”. Our brains evolved to do this to save energy. Our brains are constantly analyzing our environment, we don’t see the world how it actually is per se, we see the model our brain overlays on it. Our brain is constantly trying to find familiarity, this is why we see faces where there are no faces and why we fail to see something right in front of us if we aren’t expecting it to be there. Our brains store and are constantly trying to run “scripts” based on emotions, environment, and sensory information. Bored → scroll, tired → coffee, lonely → call friend. You don’t even have to think of solutions because your brain saves the energy of complex problem solving by saving previous solutions of similar situations in your brain. This is an essential function. Your life is literally made of your habits, you can’t change it, and please for your own sake don’t try.\n\nWhat can you do with this information? I would first stop framing it as a bad thing. It’ll only lead to you beating yourself up for having the same brain as every human who has ever and will ever live. Examine your habits and find out which ones you would like to change, which are actually bad and which are relatively neutral? Are you being too hard on yourself for literally wasting 5 minutes scrolling, or is it more like 45 minutes? Habits are very important and they shape most of your life.",

      "text": "To-do lists always made me feel behind. I'd write down ten things, finish three, and spend the evening staring at the seven I didn't do. Every day ended feeling like a failure.\n\nSo a few weeks ago I flipped it. Started writing down what I actually did instead of what I planned to do.\n\nSounds pointless but it's been weirdly powerful. At the end of the day I have this list of real things I accomplished, even small stuff. Made breakfast, returned that email, cleaned my desk, worked for two hours, called my brother.\n\nSeeing it written out makes me realize I actually did a lot. Instead of fixating on what didn't happen, I'm acknowledging what did.\n\nMy mood's been better. Less of that constant low-level guilt about not doing enough. Because I can see proof that I'm moving forward, even if it's not always the \"right\" things.\n\nI've been experimenting with different ways to track this and wrote down what's been working in case I forget later. Feels less like pressure and more like documenting progress.\n\nAnyway if you're tired of to-do lists making you feel inadequate, try tracking what you complete instead. Different feeling entirely.",

A “done” list flips that; it grounds you in what actually happened, not what should’ve happened. I like how you mentioned even small things count. That’s usually what gets erased mentally, even though those are the things that keep life moving. Less pressure, more awareness. That alone can change how a day feels. Thanks for sharing this!

Net result: more confusion, less progress.\n\nWhen I tried planning 2026, it hit me planning, researching, and ideating give me dopamine. That’s the trap. I don’t want that dopamine anymore.\n\nSo I’ve decided something very different.\n\nI’m not planning 2026.\n\nNo yearly vision. No roadmap. No big strategy decks.\nJust one rule:\n\nFinish what I start.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nRight now my biggest problems are basic:\n\t•\tPhone addiction (7+ hours/day)\n\t•\t3–4 hours Reddit\n\t•\t2–3 hours YouTube\n\t•\tRest = shows/scrolling\n\t•\tMaking decisions based on how I feel\n\t•\tStopped working out for ~6 months\n\t•\tTerrible focus due to short-form dopamine\n\t•\tFinancial + mental instability\n\nSo my real goal for 2026 is simple:\nGet my feet back on the ground… financially, mentally, physically.\n\nWhat that looks like:\n\t•\tPlan one day at a time, nothing more\n\t•\t20–30 minutes of workout daily\n\t•\tRebuild focus (meditation/spiritual practice, even if my mind wanders)\n\t•\tCut down scrolling aggressively\n\t•\tNo exploring new ideas or sectors\n\t•\tNo “research rabbit holes”\n\t•\tOnly execute what’s already on my plate\n\t•\tFeelings don’t get a vote\n\n2026 for me is not about growth hacks, vision boards, or 10-year plans.\nIt’s about discipline, boring consistency, and finishing.\n\nThat’s my plan.\n\nThanks to everyone who commented earlier.

Do not at any point compare yourself. This is YOUR year. YOUR life’s curriculum. Very few people dedicate time to this like you are.\n- don’t get stuck on which scheduling tool to use but fyi I didn’t really like google calendar as a planning tool because it doesn’t allow me to check off tasks once I’ve done them and the interface looked cluttered when I scheduled my goals and checkpoints in. I ended up using excel, an analog habit tracker, and some other tools but use what works for you…it’ll ultimately be different for everyone \n\nAbove all rooting for you. I know how thoughtful and fulfilling yet challenging  this process is because I did it. ",

Others may feel differently about this take, but:\n\nI'd say keep it high level at the one year mark. Define what you want, where you're aiming and what you're happy to sacrifice in return for those outcomes.\n\nThe James Clear quote \"You don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems,\" resonates with me on this.\n\nConsistency is king and you're a process. When you get down to it, what you're looking for here is 365 days well spent.\n\nMaster the day; Master the year. That's the engine.\n\nAfter that, quarterly goals and frequent weekly check-ins to course-correct and calibrate against a yearly aim feels like the right thing to offer here.",

What are things you want to do more of, keep the same, and do less of? Look at journals and/or your calendar can be really helpful for this.  \n2. Some other life domains to consider from your list: Social / Community, Family, Romantic, Spiritual, Play  \n3. Do some reflection on each domain. What's going well? Where might you want to improve?  \n4. Think about your goals for the year broadly, both across domains and in general. For each goal, try to figure out what success looks like.  \n5. Ask yourself \"if I could only work on 1 goal, what would it be.\" Put that at the top of your list. Then do the same until you have a list of 3-5 goals that you know are your top priorities.  \n6. Also make a plan for Q1, using a similar process (review your yearly goals, and the things upcoming in the quarter, figure out how to move things forward that you want to for Q1).  \n7. At the beginning of each week, make a quick plan for your week to stay on track with Q1 goals.  \n8. At the beginning of each day, make a quick plan for your day to stay on track for the week.  \n9. At the beginning of Q2, review Q1, review your annual goals, review the upcoming quarter, and make a plan.\n\netc.\n\nI hope this helps!",

If something else pops up, no problem - just move or delete another block. By deleting something from your ideal week, you're making a conscious decision that the other event is more important. So it makes you think twice before saying \"yes\" to something silly.\n\nAfter a week of following this, revisit. What's working and what's not? Adapt the recurring blocks as needed.\n\nI'd also suggest adding major milestones to your calendar as well and keeping track of them via a year-view calendar. Your daily / weekly time blocks should directly help you progress towards those milestones. \n\nBest of luck!",

If I keep the streak going, great, but if I miss a day, it suddenly feels worse than if I’d never tracked it at all.\n\nA silly example, but imagine a toothbrush counter at 5,000+ uses. Missing one day doesn’t just reset a number, it makes every future brush remind you of the break. At least that’s how it feels for me.\n\nI’ve found that simpler systems, like just checking something off and moving on, actually work better for my brain. Less pressure, less “I ruined it” feeling.\n\nCurious how others experience this. Does gamification genuinely help you stick with things, or does it sometimes backfire?",

Simple check and move on setups tend to hold up better because they measure completion, not perfection.

Once I can start working again, or when September rolls around and I have classes again, then I'll have lots to keep me distracted so it hopefully won't be as big of an issue.",

Look, we're AI-native\n\n If I can replace your entire \"AI Logic\" with a 10-line Regex script or a simple SQL query, your product isn't Advanced. It's inefficient.\nI got into an argument about this recently where someone claimed that removing AI features is a \"downgrade\" for a startup. They argued it makes the product less relevant.\n\nThat is complete BS.\n\nRelevance for a startup isn't about using the shiny new toy. It's about survival. If you are burning $0.03 per request to do something a Python function does for free, you aren't cutting edge. You are just bad at math.\n\nThe  \"Upgrade\" in a startup isn't moving from SQL to Vector DB. It's moving from Burning Cash to \"Default Alive.\"\n\nIf you replace a slow, expensive, hallucinating LLM call with a boring, instant, free if/else statement, you didn't downgrade your tech. You upgraded your business model.\n\nWe need to stop glorifying complexity. A boring stack that costs $0 and runs instantly is superior to a \"Modern AI Stack\" that burns runway, purely for the sake of hype.\n\nAm I wrong? Or are we all just pretending that \"AI Wrappers\" are actually good engineering?",

Resolutions are rarely kept so why set them in January? \n\nThe other thing is the January gym rush! Wait until February or even March and you'll start your gym with machines that are free and not clogged up with new year resolutioners! Just one example. \n\nSure think about goals for the year, but I say only do the  term goals you can start later in the year. Spend January planning not goal setting and achieving. That's my POV. If a goal is worth anything it's worth starting later on when the Xmas, new year and holidays period bill paying is complete.\n\nSo I make the same joke, a very poor one but it has a purpose. I say my new year's resolution is to not make any. Once you've broken a resolution you take the stress away or the pressure away. It takes the need to keep to something that isn't really a good goal for you.\n\nI do however feel setting resolutions at other times of the year to have more value. So I'll start big changes then not in January.",

Reels, random snaps, nothing I even cared about.\n\nWhat really made it hard to ignore was actually looking at my screen time. I always assumed it was not that bad, but seeing the hours added up was kind of brutal. At that point I couldn’t really pretend it wasn’t a problem anymore.\n\nI didn’t do anything extreme after that. Just small changes. Leaving my phone in another room when I needed to focus. Not touching social apps first thing in the morning so my brain wasn’t fried before I even started the day. Checking screen time once in a while just to keep myself honest.\n\nIt all sounds pretty basic, but it made a bigger difference than I expected. I’m still not perfect and I still get distracted, but I’m not stuck in that half-working, half-scrolling state all the time anymore. When I sit down to work now, I actually get into it sometimes.\n\nFeels like actual progress for once.\n\n",

Then, I'd lose interest in the mornings thinking \"I can't possibly work in the mornings. I can't concentrate it's just a waste of time.\"\nSo I'd go back to my night owl lifestyle telling myself, \"I'm not cut out for morning work.\"\n\nFinally, I found a brilliant solution: I stopped searching for the answer to this question or rather I stopped asking it altogether\n\nInstead of constantly questioning myself and trying to find the answer, I started focusing on what I was doing and how I was doing it. I noticed that I could accomplish a lot of tasks that required high concentration and precision in the early morning when it was quiet\n\nI realized that \"productive nights\" were just a last resort. I wasted time in the afternoon and didn't accomplish anything, so I had to stay up late at night to get the work I needed done.\n\nOnce I stopped forcing myself to stick to a specific schedule I stopped blaming myself for not being consistent. Some days I get a good job done before noon. Other days, I finish it after dinner. And some days honestly, it doesn't happen at all - and that's okay too.\n\nI wonder if anyone else has given up on staying up late and going to bed early and felt more natural afterward?!",

And then we stress when we don't fit perfectly. I think a lot of it comes down to just paying attention to how you actually feel instead of how you think you're supposed to feel based on some label you gave yourself at 22. Some days I'm up early and crushing it, some days I'm useless until 2pm. Both are fine.\n\n\n\nThe pressure to optimize every hour of every day is exhausting anyway.
