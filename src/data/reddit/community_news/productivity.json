      "text": "neuro student here and honestly... i’m kind of embarrassed to even type this out considering what i actually study. like i spend my entire day in the lab staring at dopamine pathways and reward circuits under a microscope, and then i’d literally get home and just waste away for 4 hours straight. just staring at absolute garbage on social media until my eyes actually burned.\n\ni used to tell myself i just lacked discipline or whatever but it’s not even a moral failing. my brain was just conditioned to need that constant hit of novelty to the point where sitting in silence felt physically painful. tried all that \"productivity guru\" crap and none of it worked for me. here’s the only stuff that actually stopped me from wanting to throw my phone into a lake:\n\n1. the paper list. i had to stop using notes apps because they’re a trap because they’re on the phone. now i just use a shitty notebook and write down 4 things: someone to text, a chapter to read, a drink like tea, and one 50 min task. that’s it.\n\n2. the \"human\" buffer. if i actually talk to a real person after lab, the urge to scroll drops by like 90%. i think it just kills that \"stimulus hunger.\"\n\n3. the \"off\" switch. this is the big one. i turn my phone completely OFF before i even walk in the door. not silent. OFF. the 30 seconds it takes to reboot is usually enough friction to kill the impulse when i’m brushing my teeth and my brain goes \"check the feed.\"\n\n4. the \"win\" task. i just do one 50 min thing like studying or cleaning. ending the day with a finished task feels \"heavy\" in a good way, way better than the high of a 15 second short video.\n\n5. closing loops. i just dump everything stressing me out onto paper and then write one tiny, stupid step for tomorrow. not \"fix my life,\" just \"email the lab tech.\" it stops the brain loops so i can actually sleep.\n\nlook i still fuck up. some nights i’m just dead and i rot on the couch anyway. but my nights feel like mine again. i stopped trying to use willpower because mine is gone by 9pm and i just made it harder to use the phone.\n\ntldr; your brain isn't broken, your environment just sucks. make it harder to use your phone and stop being a degenerate.",

      "text": "My company went fully remote in early 2023. I was excited at first. No more commute, no more pretending to look busy, I could actually focus on work. That lasted maybe three months.\n\nI don't know when it started but at some point I stopped using my desk entirely. It became a place to dump laundry. Every morning I would just grab my laptop and sink into the couch. Then the couch became my office, my lunch spot, my Netflix spot, my everything spot. I was replying to slack messages at 11pm in the same position I woke up in. Last month my manager asked me to turn on my camera for a call and I realized I was literally horizontal. I had to pretend my camera was broken because I could not sit up fast enough without it being weird.\n\nI started seeing a therapist a few weeks ago, mostly for anxiety stuff. At some point I mentioned how I felt like I was drifting through days and she asked me where I work. I said the couch. She kind of laughed and said something like, your brain can not tell the difference between work and rest if you never move. It sounded too simple to actually matter but it stuck with me.\n\nSo last week I cleared a corner in my bedroom. Got an old desk off marketplace for 40 bucks. Bought an actual desk chair because the dining chair was killing my back. First morning sitting there felt stupid honestly. Like I was playing pretend office. But I also finished more actual work by noon than I had in weeks. I am not saying it fixed everything. Some days I still end up back on the couch by 3pm. But at least now I notice when it happens.\n\nTwo years of drifting and the answer was literally just sitting somewhere else. Wild how that works.\n\nEdit: okay so a few people asked what my setup looks like now. Honestly I skipped the cheap desk route because my back was already complaining from two years of couch posture. Figured if I was finally going to commit to a real workspace I should just do it right. Ended up getting an electric standing desk from Colamy. Being able to switch between sitting and standing actually helps more than I expected, especially around 2pm when I start feeling sluggish. I used to think standing desks were kind of gimmicky but just hitting a button and changing position keeps me from losing focus. Still not a perfect system but way better than the couch era.",

The designated work space is so important, glad you made that change! :) The only thing that bums me out is the desk I custom made myself was built around it being for work and for crafting/painting etc. unfortunately after being there for 8 hours a day for work, I never want to sit there to do anything else.  \n\nOn another note, something that helps me is to get out for a quick walk in the fresh air during lunch or right after work. It’s easy to go days without leaving the house when you wfh so for me even just a 20 minute walk with my dog makes a huge difference. \n\nI also sometimes will take a drive after work. It doesn’t have to be anywhere in particular, but it kind of mimics a little commute and splits up the end of the work day and your personal time.  Congrats on the positive changes!",

Your therapist nailed something most productivity advice completely misses - the neuroscience of context switching. \n\nWhen you have ADHD, your prefrontal cortex (executive function center) already struggles with task switching and focus regulation. Working from the same spot you relax creates what researchers call \"contextual interference\" - your brain literally can't figure out which mode it should be in. \n\nI went through the exact same couch spiral during remote work. The game changer for me wasn't just changing locations, but understanding WHY it works: ADHD brains rely heavily on environmental cues for dopamine regulation and attention control. New location = brain recognizes \"work context\" and starts producing the right neurochemicals. \n\nYour $40 marketplace desk probably did more for your executive function than any productivity app ever could. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most powerful because they work WITH your brain instead of against it. \n\nThe fact that you notice when you drift back to the couch by 3pm shows you've built real self-awareness. That noticing is actually a huge ADHD skill - most of us operate on autopilot and don't realize we've switched contexts until hours later.",

I used to nap in my bed during the day and then at night I couldn’t fall asleep. Same bed, different purpose, and my brain just stopped associating it clearly with sleep. Once I moved naps somewhere else, it fixed itself way faster than I expected.\n\nWork is the same for me. I don’t think the couch is bad, but when one spot becomes everything, the day kind of melts together. now I try to create zones. morning personal projects on the couch for a bit, actual work only in my office with a real chair and decent lighting. when I leave that room, work is done.\n\nThe other thing that changed everything was breaks. I cap work at about 55 minutes, then I force myself to stand up and walk for 5–10. if I don’t, I’ll look up and realize I’ve basically been frozen in one position for hours.\n\nit sounds almost too simple, but physical boundaries create mental ones.

Phone isnt a routine, its a distraction. \n\nI personally roll out of bed, and do push ups/weights/stretches every morning to get blood pumping as I get ready, heave breakfast etc. To get here I started small and got myself a few succulents pot plants, so every morning I roll out of bed, open the curtains and water them, then make my bed. These few small things helped me to get used to get up first thing after waking up, and get going. Now I have some what of a routine, where I do excercise shower, eat and check phone, and leave home. There isnt enough time in the day as is, and the best thing to help me avoid brain rot is to follow that usual advice: Get tough tasks out of the way, which means getting my blood puming. Its not for everyone, but it works, where as phone is just prime the brain for media consumption and no thinking which sets up the so so day.",

Gets me charged up and on it, remembering my why!\n\nThat said, a nice coffee, 1min dead hang and a stretching routine, journaling, morning pages (as someone else rightly mentions), meditation (Henry Shukman The Way app is amazing), reading, cold tub, oh and I’ve got these AYO glasses that shine blue light in my eyes (winter blues)—my morning routine ended up becoming like an entire day hence the need for a 10 minute protocol, especially since I had kids.",

Then in the morning, the first thing I do is make my bed. Then I drink water and go stretch because my body was frozen in place for 7-8 hours. Then I meditate for five minutes, followed by writing a journal entry of what I want to do that day. Meditation is a must. If you can't be in silence with your own thoughts for 5 minutes, then how can you do anything? Then if time permits, I go on a 5k jog. That's the start of my day.\n\n\nWhen work starts, I try to do the most difficult task first. That way, everything else following will be easier.

Crossword puzzles always seem like too much pressure when I’m trying to ease into my morning or wind down at bedtime, but word searches feel so chill and casual to me, but you can still choose level of difficulty to keep brain stimulation up. I have a book of cozy, meditative word searches, and I have another book that is random facts like words associated with an event or historical moment, so if it seems intriguing then I do a deep dive into the history too, kind of keeps my brain stimulated or craving more. Having more than one type of word search allows me to choose based on my mood or goal of what I want to get out of it. Also, most typical wordsearch books are not super enticing. Like even if you get to a puzzle themed “Travel”, it’s words about a business trip, CEO, brief case, etc. So, I intentionally sought out cozy word search books instead of just a random airport gift shop one, though they are still fine in a pinch!!! \n\nIdeally I prefer paper books to get away from phone distractions, but sometimes phone apps are nice if you’re in a waiting room or on the bus,  or sometimes just because you’d rather play on your phone, etc. \n\nI also play mahjong in a phone app!

      "text": "ok so this is kind of embarrassing but I think I need to say it somewhere\n\nFor like the past year I've been waking up at 6am, making coffee, sitting down at my desk by 6:30. I have a whole morning routine. I journal, I review my task list, I plan my day. I felt really good about it honestly. Like I was doing everything right\n\nexcept I kept ending the day having done almost none of the actual important stuff. And I couldn't figure out why because I was \"being productive\" for like 10+ hours\n\nIt finally hit me last week when my girlfriend watched me work for a bit and was like \"you know you've been rearranging that same list for 20 minutes right\"\n\nand I got defensive about it obviously. But then I actually paid attention the next day and she was right. I spend SO much time organizing my tasks, color coding things, moving stuff between apps, tweaking my system. I moved from Todoist to Notion to Obsidian to just Apple Notes back to Notion in the span of maybe 4 months? Each time I'd spend like a full weekend migrating everything and \"setting up my system\" and feeling super accomplished about it\n\nI wasn't doing work. I was doing the performance of work. The planning and organizing felt like productivity because it involves effort and screens and typing but none of it was actually moving anything forward\n\nThe thing that made it click was I tried something stupid simple. I wrote 3 things on a post it note on monday morning. Just 3 things I needed to finish that day. No app, no color coding, no priority matrix. and I finished all 3 by like 2pm. I literally had never done that before. Not once in the past year of my elaborate productivity system\n\nI'm not saying apps are bad or whatever. I just think I personally was using the organization as a way to avoid the actual hard tasks. because organizing feels productive and safe but the real work is uncomfortable and I might fail at it or something idk\n\nhas anyone else dealt with this? I feel like I can't be the only one who fell into this trap",

I did almost the exact same thing before I realized that \"setting up my system\" was my favorite form of procrastination.\n\nYour girlfriend's observation is gold. The 20 minutes rearranging a list IS the problem. Not the tool, not the system - the fiddling.\n\nWhat clicked for me was separating two totally different types of tasks. Stuff that needs doing today? That's your post-it note, 3 things max, no app needed - you already proved this works. But then there's recurring maintenance stuff (cleaning, bills, groceries, admin) which needs tracking somewhere but should NEVER appear on your daily priority list. It's a totally different cognitive category.\n\nThe second category is what pulls people back into system-building. \"I need to remember to do X every 2 weeks\" -> \"I'll set up a system for that\" -> 3 hours later you've redesigned your entire Notion workspace.\n\nI ended up building a dead-simple app just for the recurring stuff (N-day - developer disclosure) specifically because I needed something I could NOT fiddle with. There's literally nothing to customize. You add a task, set the interval, tap done. No templates, no views, no color coding, no migration weekends.\n\nBut honestly the post-it note insight is the real win. The tool for the recurring stuff is secondary. You already figured out the hard part.",

Because it takes a lot of effort to track tasks, organize, etc.\n\nI use Obsidian to track my monthly goals with a checklist. The goals are made at the start of the month or end of the last month. The goals are usually the same: learn 2 recipes, read 2 books, workout X times, etc. I update the checklist like once a week when needed.\n\nI don’t use any apps to track recurring tasks, because I already have a routine so I don’t spend time creating daily tasks and crossing them out. For example, on Saturday, I’m productive from 9am - 12pm. I already know to start with 30 minutes of reading - I don’t need to make a task for that. I already know then afterwards I might be learning Japanese or coding on my iOS apps until 12pm. I don’t need to make tasks for that because I have a routine.\n\nWhat I do make tasks for, is if it’s something that will take weeks to complete, which I use Microsoft To Do. So for example, learning Japanese. I’ll have tasks there like: Lesson 1, Lesson 1 course book questions, and Lesson 1 workbook questions. Etc. But I don’t make daily tasks like “Work on Lesson 1 notes”, “Continue working on lesson 1 questions” since I already know since I have a routine. Same for my iOS apps: Fix Bug X, Add Feature Y. But I don’t need daily tasks.\n\nFinally, I use Apple’s Reminders app for non-productive reasons: recurring home maintenance, grocery list, etc. Reminders app is for personal stuff, To Do is for productivity stuff. Obsidian is for monthly goal tracking.",

That the organisation system thing is giving you your dopamine hit more than completion of your planned tasks. Further evidence is the way you keep changing the organisational system or tool. It seems very ADHD-like to me. \n\nOf course you don't need to have ADHD to be doing this dopamine hit thing from your planning. It is probably quite common. The key thing is that you've realised it's a problem. That means to can affect a change. \n\nMy advice is to leave apps and programs alone as much as possible. Remove them if you can.\n\nI would suggest going analogue in a simple way. A diary (UK meaning as a planning tool not a journal of what you did) with appointment times and space for notes.\n\nDon't substitute digital planning tools for analogue ones where you're doing too much analogue planning in the same way as your digital planning.\n\nTime block your day with meetings, meeting prep times and other work tasks assigned time to work on. I don't think you need to say that the task X must be done in 2 hours from 14:30 to 16:30 without fail. Just that is the time allocated to progress it forwards. Don't rush to finish just do those two hours of work and progress on that task. Finish before if you're at a good place in it to stop.\n\nBasically I say that you're spending 5 minutes every day reviewing the last day and getting the current day blocked out with fixed work task times. That you're sticking to those times and not planning instead. The thing is you're doing not planning. You spend very little time planning as that's your procrastination weakness. So simply put do very little of it. Change the time to more productive work instead. Sounds easy and it is but may take some time to develop into the better work habit. \n\nBTW your analogue post it note success of a day shows that keeping the planning stage as simple as possible, hence my advice about analogue only, is the right way forward for you.\n\nI would even go as far as saying you allocate time at the end of the working day to planning for the next day. That way the natural tendency of people to be looking forward to finishing work plays to your advantage. You allocate your last 5 minutes to planning means you'll stick to it or miss your train home if working in an office. Or your WFH day goes on longer than you want. It kind of associates over planning with a negative of having to be at work longer than you should or longer than you get paid for.",

What finally broke me out of it was realizing there are two separate problems that people keep conflating.\n\n**Problem 1:** What do I need to do today? Your post-it note. 3 items max. You nailed this.\n\n**Problem 2:** What recurring stuff needs tracking over time? Bills, maintenance, weekly reviews. This is where people get sucked back into system-building, because they try to solve BOTH with one elaborate tool.\n\nI tested a bunch of things for problem 2:\n\n- Todoist: Good for recurring tasks but the UI tempts you into overcomplicating with labels, filters, priorities\n- Notion: Powerful but dangerous for us. Too customizable. You spend more time building than using\n- Apple Reminders: Actually underrated for simple recurring stuff. Set and forget\n- Plain calendar events: Works surprisingly well for things like 'check smoke detectors' every 6 months\n\nThe key was keeping these systems completely separate. Daily priorities stay analog. Recurring tracking goes somewhere you cannot fiddle with. The moment you merge them into one system you are back in the optimization loop.",

Every time you color-code, rearrange, or migrate to a new app, your brain registers real cognitive effort and rewards you for it. That's why it feels productive. You're spending genuine mental energy. Just not on anything that moves forward.\n\nThe post-it works for the exact opposite reason. Three items, no categories, no system to tweak. Your brain has nothing left to organize so the only remaining option is doing the thing.\n\nThe part that stings: real work usually involves decisions with uncertain outcomes (this paragraph might be bad, this client might push back). Organizing has zero risk. So your brain picks the safe decisions every time unless you take them off the table entirely.",

I personally did it for years\n\nEveryone keeps saying \"manage your time better\", \"wake up earlier\", \"use a planner”. Cool advice, tried all of it, like bought planners, downloaded time tracking apps, even tried that stupid time blocking thing. Nothing worked cuz the problem was never about time \n\nHere's what I realized -> I had plenty of time. I just didn't want to admit how I was spending it like when I actually tracked one full week of what I was doing hour by hour, it was embarrassing (really embarrassing believe me)\n\nWhat you really saying when u say \"I don't have time\" is -> this thing is not important enough for me to do. And that's fine honestly but at least be honest about it\n\nWhat actually changed for me -> I stopped saying I don't have enough time and started saying \"it's not a priority”. \n\nTry it for one week. Instead of \"I don't have time to work out\" say \"working out is not a priority for me”. \n\nSounds different…\n\nCuz once you hear yourself say \"my health is not a priority\" something clicks and you either actually do it or accept you don't care. Both better than lying to yourself every day.\n\nI went from \"I have no time for anything\" to studying,  learning new skills, reading daily, and working out, same 24 hours. \n\nI just stopped bullshitting myself about where they were going",

I know that to reach that point, I need to put in the work. I am okay with putting in the work, and want to improve myself. But my brain *literally* refuses to listen to me. I have to negotiate with it 24/7 to even convince myself to do the work. This leaves me exhausted when I have to do the actual work that I end up half-assing it. Why does this happen?\n\nWhy can my brain not understand where I want to go? It does 2 things. It either negotiates with me, saying that we can do it in 5 min, etc. Else, it begins pulling up receipts of people who are better than me in that skill, and begins comparing and saying that I can never be like them. And I have to tell myself, \"Yeah, you can never be like them if you don't put in the work. Do the work and you can be like them too\". But my brain is like, \"But they have 3 years of experience, you can never have that\" and this goes on and on until either my brain or I give up, and by then, both of us are exhausted.\n\nThe thing is, this isn't consistent at all. I cannot consistently code for a week, but I have been tracking calories for 400 days now without a break. I can power through the boredom of getting better in a task and practice shooting as a sport, but I cannot read a boring textbook which is needed to understand a subject I am interested in. I absolutely hate this inconsistency with myself and I view it as a sign of weakness.\n\nHow do I make my brain consistent in being disciplined? How can I make my brain not negotiate with me and exhaust me? How do I fulfill promises made to myself? How can I get started to put the effort to where I want to be?",

I cannot consistently code for a week, but I have been tracking calories for 400 days now without a break.\n\nIt sounds like you don't like coding but really care about your health/physical appearance. You're attempting to force yourself to do something you're not truly interested in or passionate about.\n\n> I can power through the boredom of getting better in a task and practice shooting as a sport\n\nSounds like you're interested in the task. Sounds like you have a knack for weapons.\n\n> but I cannot read a boring textbook which is needed to understand a subject I am interested in. I absolutely hate this inconsistency with myself and I view it as a sign of weakness. \n\nBut you're perhaps lying to yourself in saying that you care about this \"subject\".\n\nFor context, I worked on some game jams and pushed myself to code for like 12+ hours a day for 7 days a week, because I was having fun and wanted the result. I enjoyed the process and the potential outcome. If I didn't enjoy the process or the outcome, I wouldn't have done it.\n\nI don't particularly like programming. I've dabbled with it for an eternity, but have never shipped any really applications. But I love making games. So it tracks.\n\nI also try to tell myself I love all video games and I love playing them. I own nearly 1,500 of them. I've played maybe 300 of them. I tell myself to play the games, but I find myself burning out of playing certain kinds of them. I watch YouTube videos of others playing these types of games, but I just can't pull myself to push through and play them. Am I just wasting money? Most definitely at this point.\n\nSo yeah, maybe you just need to have a deeper look at yourself and be honest: do you sincerely enjoy the \"subjects\" you are focusing on? If it is, you shouldn't need to struggle with motivation to do them. The motivation should be built in.\n\nIf you're struggling to find the motivation, you need to have a moment of reflection and ask if you're really focusing your efforts on something that you really want to do. Because if it's not something you want to do, maybe it's worth asking if you should shift your focus towards something you can be more passionate about and have better outcomes from natural desire to do those things.\n\nAnyways, that's just my two cents.",

Often esp for neurodivergent types, the task initiation and executive dysfunction are majority causes for productivity, and just starting no matter how small can snowball into productive time. \n\nI often trick myself into doing something, but telling letting myself feel the motions and whilst im feelings, i tell myself 'look i know i feel like i cant do this all now, but at minimum i can move this dirty pile of clothes into hamper, or take the glass to the sink.' then when im there and doing something my brain can easily accommodate another task because the dopamine hit from accomplishing a teeny tiny task is enough motivation to go further. \n\nanother thing to do, is to have planner, and then when trying to do a task you dont want to, like going to the gym. You trick your brain with sidequests and sidethoughts. Like pack the gym bag, get water, get dressed. Focus all your attention on the setting up of the task, then take that small step/leap into doing something/anything and often the rest will follow. The trick here is to overload your brain with thoughts other than those of the task, so that when you get to the gym and already there you might as well do soemthing even if its small, and it snowballs. IF your brain cant have the time to have an emotional crisis over the task and its implications, your brain cant fully lock you out of doing it. \n\nIf you write out a goal and a process to achieve it, you can break down the tasks into small tasks, and take it one small step at a time. If you ever get overwhelmed, take the 5-55min to feel it if you need, and then take a small step forward. Eventually it will be easy to overcome your own brain with these small steps and trickery. \n\nAnd thats discipline in a nutshell, doing things when we said we would do, through mental gymastics to over come executive dysfunctione tc.",

But this is where I learned the countdown method. Alarm goes off? Countdown from three and just get up when you say “1”. It really helps your brain from not talking you out of doing whatever you were suddenly motivated to do. \n\n“Doing a task for at least 15 minutes” is a good thing to add on to the “countdown method”. \n\nScenario: “shoot I need to finish this work before my presentation next week.” Ok… 3, 2, 1, and I’m up! I immediately go to my clean and organized desk with the mindset that I’ll just do 15 minutes of work. I still use these two methods to do something when I don’t feel like it, but the intended 15 minutes of work now turns into hours of solid focus. \n\nDo this even on weekends, when you don’t have plans…. Training your mind to do something as soon as you have the motivation to do it, changes something in your brain and that consistent effort paired with even the slightest progress every day accumulates over time.",

I want to be a good professor. I really do, I spent years of my life studying. Yet I struggle to put in the work on an everyday basis. \n\nHow I identified the problem is : feeling like I did a good work, seeing students actually learn and being invested in my class is what I want and like. But I don't like scrolling endlessly on some archive Web page to find the right document to study with them in class. I don't like doing all the administrative tasks that come with being a professor. Etc.\n\n3. Gamification is a thing : our brain seeks quick and low effort rewards. That's just how it is, we are still apes trying to survive on a daily basis for our brain. So everytime I need to do something I don't enjoy in order to, further down the road, do something I actually enjoy, I divide the work in small tasks and reward myself when I complete one.\n\nResponded to some emails? Yeah, coffee time (I love coffee). Actually wrote down my plan for the next class? Yeah, snack time. Spend 1h grading student works? Yeah, time to grab my wife's butt and steal a kiss. Etc etc.\n\n4. We aren't meant to be working 8 or 10h a day. Realistically, we have maybe 3 to 5 good effective hours of work in ourself for a day. Not much more.

Talk to a counseller first and possibly tune your sleep cycle (going to the gym the same time helped me back then, got me tired enough to shower and sleep) \n\nSecond, when learning tech the first time it's important to apply tech on something you are interested, create your own website with the stuff you learnt   \n\nThirdly, try different learning styles, one person's style is different from another, some prefer visuals others prefer hands on. If you are learning a programming language outside study, learning from textbook is very inefficient, try following an online tutorial on CRUD instead and add your creativity in it.   \n\nAlso, know that your brain is like a muscle, it takes small repetition for it to remember, so take a few minutes to tell yourself what does a piece of information is trying to teach you. \n\nRecord what concepts or techniques you learn, not how many problems you solved. That way you may feel more progress",

I tried to learn some coding at some point, I had end results that I wanted to reach that were simple and asked an LLM and kept asking it questions. LLMs helped a lot keeping me curious and engaged after that initial step. Whether I'm doing theoretical work or trying to do a simulation, I keep asking it questions. Asking it to summarize a page. Asking \"why?\" many, many times. Then repeating what I understood to confirm if I got it right.\n\nI also was using a productivity games on mobile, then on steam before all this. Has pomodoro timer built in. In the mobile app if I studied enough I could be able to plant a real tree. I have! On the steam one, it's more about romanticizing the study time. I set up a room, set up a view, let it rain in that world etc. \n\nAlso during undergrad I would keep going to the library. I wouldn't get the negotiation of my brain, even if I did, as long as you take action and don't just sit there and listen you forget about it. \n\nI dunno if any of these would help, as I just said \"just ignore it\" but I do have times when I can't ignore it. It's insane how convincing the arguments are when I need to wake up. I missed flights due to that. But thinking about it, I think I can't immediately take action when sleeping or when I just am barely awake. Thus I end up listening to that part. You gotta just cut the brain short, ignore and make your hands and feet work. If what you're doing is interesting enough, you lose yourself in the task anyways.",

That's not a person who lacks discipline.\n\nThe difference between tracking calories and sitting down to code isn't willpower. It's the number of decisions per minute. Tracking is one repeated choice: log or skip. Coding is hundreds of micro-decisions made back-to-back..  what to write, how to structure it, which approach, what to name things. Your brain calculates that cost before you even open the editor and starts negotiating to avoid it.\n\nThat's also why the negotiation gets louder as the tasks get harder. It's not the difficulty your brain is reacting to. It's the volume of unpredictable decisions it can see coming.\n\nWhat helped me was shrinking the decision count before starting. Not \"code for an hour\" but \"open the file and write the function name.\" One decision. Then the next one. The negotiation stops when the cost of starting is small enough not to trigger the avoidance.",

      "text": "I have a lot of „passive hobbies“: Gaming, drawing, crocheting and many more. I started working half a year ago after failing to find a fun university degree. So I went from sitting at home most of the time or sitting in a lecture hall to standing most of the day and doing handiwork. I like my job and most of the time it’s not that physical exhausting. But after work I literally can’t do anything. Once I sit down at my desk I feel too „weak“ to do anything that requires any focus. When I open a game I just run in circles and don’t properly play because I don’t really feel like doing anything specific and I don’t even try to draw because I can’t think of something. Yesterday I sat down at the couch and talked to my partner after work like we usually do and I instantly fell asleep after they got up to do something. I ended up sleeping for two hours and them making food even tho cooking is usually my responsibility. I feel guilty and bad if I do nothing. I wanna draw more since I wanna do art professionally some day, even if not as my main job, but also gaming is my way of socializing on weekdays but not being able to game because I‘m so exhausted is sad. I sleep enough and I eat rather healthy most of the time, the last time I got bloodwork done was a year ago and the results were fine. I want more meaningful free time. It’s not like I give 110% at work and over exhaust myself. What are things I can do to get more energy? I don’t spend a lot of time on social media (I have limited screen time on everything, 20 mins) and I don’t drink coffee, so it’s not like I’m feeling the caffeine low after work. The only thing I can think of is that I‘m rather unfit, I lost a lot of weight because I dieted so I look slim but I have no stamina nor strength. Any help is appreciated!!",

A balanced circadian rhythm makes it easier to sleep early at night, and wake up early in the morning. So do this in addition:\n\n5. Wake up early in the morning, 30 grams of protein in 30 minutes waking, and walk for 30 minutes (bath yourself in sun light). You dont need a perfect 8 hours of sleep to start doing this. 3 - 4 hours can do it. This is the reset/maintain of circadian rhythm part\n\n6. Add a zone 2 heart rate training, 20-30 minutes, or any type of training. This helps you sleep better at night since it's slowing your resting heart rate, making it more restful to sleep (improving sleep quality/deep sleep)",

Running home from work, or working out in my lunch break really helps. Also, when the kids are in bed I do a short yoga session, that helps energize me and give me mental energy to focus on other things. \n\nSocial media = brain rot, it drains energy rather than give it.

          "text": "What you’re describing actually makes a lot of sense. You went from a mostly sedentary life to standing and doing handiwork all day. Even if it doesn’t feel “intensely physical,” your body is still adapting. Low level physical fatigue plus mental adjustment can hit harder than people expect. It’s not dramatic exhaustion, it’s just this flat drained feeling where your brain doesn’t want to initiate anything. The first thing I’d look at is basic physical capacity. You said you’re slim but unfit. That matters more than people realize. If your baseline stamina and strength are low, your job is taking a bigger percentage of your total energy. When your capacity is small, normal effort feels huge. Building even moderate strength and cardio can change that. Not extreme workouts. Just 2 to 3 short strength sessions a week and maybe light cardio. Over time your job will feel easier and you’ll have more left in the tank.\n\nSecond, stop going straight from work mode to “creative performance” mode. Your brain probably needs a transition. Right now you sit down and expect yourself to draw something meaningful or properly game. That’s pressure when you’re already tired. Try a 20 to 30 minute reset after work. Quick walk. Shower. Lie down with eyes closed but don’t sleep. Small snack with protein and carbs. Let your nervous system come down. Then choose one small intentional thing. Not “draw for two hours.” Just sketch for 15 minutes. Not “game all evening.” Just one match. Reduce the activation energy. Also, be careful with the after work nap. A two hour crash nap can make you groggier and steal your evening. If you really need it, set a 20 to 30 minute timer. Keep it short. Long naps can make the whole evening feel foggy.\n\nAnd honestly, some of this might just be an adjustment phase. Six months feels long but your body and brain are still adapting to a different rhythm of life. You are not lazy. You are adapting. The guilt is probably draining more energy than the job. You’re judging yourself for being tired instead of working with it. Instead of trying to have “perfect meaningful evenings,” aim for one intentional action per night. One sketch. One proper game session. One small step toward art. That keeps the identity alive without demanding superhero energy. If you build your physical base a bit, add a transition ritual, shorten naps, and lower the pressure on your hobbies, I think you’ll start feeling more in control of your evenings. Right now it sounds less like a motivation problem and more like a capacity and recovery problem. And those can actually be improved.",

A lot of what you’re describing sounds like physical fatigue bleeding into mental fog.\n\nTwo things I’d look at:\n\nFirst, baseline fitness and fueling. if you dieted down and lost muscle, your body may just not have much reserve. Light strength training 2 to 3 times a week and making sure you’re actually eating enough, especially protein and carbs around work, can change energy levels more than people expect.\n\nSecond, transition rituals. If you sit down immediately after work, your body might interpret that as shutdown mode. A 20 minute walk, shower, or quick reset routine before hobbies can help you shift gears instead of crashing.\n\nAlso, don’t underestimate sleep quality vs sleep length. even “enough hours” can still be low quality if your schedule is off.\n\nIf you could change one thing first, i’d start with building a little strength back. more capacity usually equals more usable energy.",

Showered and thought about it. Lay awake and thought about it. More circles.\n\nDay eleven I went for a walk because I needed to leave my apartment. Headphones were dead. Didn't look for the cable.\n\nSomewhere around minute 35, not thinking about the decision at all - I was actually thinking about why the proportions on a building I was passing looked slightly wrong - the answer arrived. Clean. Obvious. Like it had been ready for a while.\n\nI've read the neuroscience since. Default mode network, diffuse attention, walking and cognition. All of it confirms what that walk demonstrated privately: the brain solves things in the background when you stop foregrounding them, and unstructured movement without audio input is one of the most reliable ways to let it do that.\n\nThe problem is it produces nothing you can log. The walk looks like a walk. The output shows up later in the work, unattributed. So nobody builds it into their system.\n\nI now protect one hour a week with no input and no output. Phone exists but stays in my pocket. No podcast, no planning, nothing to produce. Started thinking of it as infrastructure for the work rather than a break from it.\n\nThe ROI showed up in the eleven-day problem and that was enough evidence for me.",

Then one afternoon I went for a walk with no phone and no podcast, just silence. About twenty minutes in, the whole structure just appeared. I was not even thinking about it consciously.\n\nI think our brains need that downtime to process things in the background. When we are actively trying to solve something, we can become too zoomed in. Walking, showering, or driving somewhere familiar seems to let a more diffuse mode of thinking kick in and connect dots we could not see up close.\n\nWhat you are describing is real, and it happens more than people give it credit for. I have started treating walks as part of my actual work, not a break from it. It is a different frame, but it changes everything.",

I block everything which isn't important. Even things which may be important I block, because you can still use these apps for 5 mins. I keep my phone out of view.\n* Changing my pc setup: I have multiple users for different work on my pc. On my \"work user\" I don't have distracting apps installed or files nearby. I block everything. Additionally, I might install a visible blocker at my desk, so I can't get distracted by my surroundings.\n* More important to me is my calendar. I plan my day every evening for the next day. Then while working, I time track my tasks and have them automatically transfer to my calendar. This allows me to see how good I did and If I need to improve my planning. The tracking also adds friction, because when I for example want to watch YouTube instead of working, I first have to stop the timer and then start a new one. I also then see it in my calendar that I didn't adhere to my goals and allowed my procrastination. This visualization is key to me. This workflow really boosted my productivity.",

Get clear with the goal, or have an idea of the bigger goal (what you want to achieve). Knowing what to do is important.\n\n2. Choose 3 tasks that would move me forward and make the day feel like a success.\n\n2. Set time blocks and make sure that it gets BLOCKED (no distractions, other tasks, commitments).

          "text": "Honestly most productivity “secrets” are boring and kind of unsexy. The big one for me is designing my day so I do not have to rely on willpower. If I have to fight myself every hour I will lose. So I make the right thing the easy thing. Phone in another room. Laptop with only the tab I need open. Clear desk. Water next to me. I remove decisions before I start. Second is starting before I feel ready. Waiting to feel focused is a trap. I set a small entry point like ten minutes and I begin even if my brain feels scattered. Nine times out of ten focus shows up after action not before. The first few minutes are friction. If you survive that, momentum takes over.\n\nThird is single tasking aggressively. No music with lyrics. No multitasking. No checking messages “quickly.” I treat attention like something fragile. Once it fractures it takes way more energy to rebuild than people realize. So I protect it hard. Another underrated one is tracking output not time. Instead of “I studied three hours” it becomes “I finished two problem sets” or “I wrote 800 words.” It shifts you from sitting there to actually producing. Time can be faked. Output cannot.\n\nAnd finally I respect my energy. I do hard things when my brain is sharp and easy admin when I am tired. A lot of people try to brute force deep work at 10 pm and then think they have a discipline issue. Sometimes it is just bad timing. You already named strong ones. Limiting phone use is huge. Quiet is powerful. Classical works because it removes verbal interference. The real theme behind all of this is the same though. Control your environment and lower friction. Focus is less about forcing your brain and more about removing what pulls it away.",

      "text": "I was following Dopamine Detox Blueprint for 3 weeks or 4 weeks, you can say, and I am going to share all the things that I have collected and followed this time.\n\n**DD blueprint**\n\n1. Caffeine (tea and coffee)\n2. Songs (i face earworms ) and Movies\n3. Reels and Shorts (i never used insta but i used to watch yt shorts...)\n4. Quora (sometimes vulgar content u know and violent content u know )\n5. P#rn and M#asturbation\n6. Movies\n\n**what helped me in this journey so far :**\n\n1. **leaving tea and coffee completely** : First, it helped me in calming my nervous system so I can rest better, sleep better, and nap better. Secondly, I have a little bit of constipation, so it helped me in constipation also.\n2. **leaving songs, reels / shorts**: I experience earworms, where songs I listen to keep repeating in my mind. I stopped listening to music for a while, and it helped me sleep better and think more clearly. The earworms were contributing to my brain fog, and by reducing them, I was able to significantly lessen that brain fog.\n3. **leaving movies** : I used to fantasize about it after watching it, and instead of resting it, it makes me fantasize more and increase my brain focus, so I think it is better to reduce it.\n4. **leaving quora** : Just a lot of vulgar content\n\n**and my routine is like :**\n\nI wake up at 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning and do all the rest of the stuff, and at night I follow the 11:00-6:00 routine, like I close all the devices till 10:30 and sleep till 11 p.m. last. Actually, I am a college student so I I have no time to make a schedule between this time.\n\n**EDIT : A lot of people are asking where I get stimulation from. ?**\n\n* I get my stimulation from various podcasts and lectures, and I read a lot on different topics like narcissism and astrology and different topics.\n* In addition to that, I didn't put any limitations on my food; I do eat fast food 😋😋 except caffeine. I didn't put limitations on various kinds of food and love eating different kinds of food, especially sweet things. even before the dopamine detox !!\n* I socialize more than before, and I know if I lowered the dopamine to an extreme, then it will cause motivation issues, work issues, and sleeping issues, because I have done dopamine detox after reading some famous books on dopamine.\n\n**And talking about the benefits i got :**\n\n1. Better energy whole day\n2. clear mind and weird type of sense of satisfaction and happiness in the mind\n3. feeling a bit lonely after 1.5 week mark is done may be still withdrawls are going on\n4. My nervous system is now calm down, so I can have better rest, better sleeps, better naps.\n5. I can think better, in terms of calculation-wise, and now I am present in the moment while talking.\n\n**Final conclusion :**\n\nnot going to follow these whole my life, except the songs and caffeine part, but will do it every few months, like every three months, 15 days of Dopamine Detox or something like that. That will reboot my system and recharge my body.",

Pick one keystone habit per season and write the \"floor\" version you can complete on a terrible day (2 push-ups, 5-minute clean-up, 1 outbound email). Floors keep the identity alive; ceilings are just bonus credit.\n2. Pre-log the friction you expect (kids waking up, late meetings, low energy) and write a default response now. When the obstacle hits you just run the script instead of renegotiating with yourself.\n3. Audit the scoreboard weekly: % of days you hit the floor, % of days you exceeded it, and one tweak for the next cycle. The scoreboard is what convinces your brain the micro actions are compounding.\n\nIf you want a plug-and-play version of that scoreboard, 3D Habits was built exactly for daily micro floors + weekly audit prompts + accountability nudges.

Overthinking is the problem that is an obsessive type of behaviour.\n\nBy taking away the thinking and being scared of your thoughts you take away the chance for self improvement and healing. You would start having poor sleep or nightmares because your subconscious is doing all of the heavy lifting now to get the message across. If by end of the day you don’t have any space for reflection, then how are you going to learn from your mistakes? How are you going to understand why you feel how you feel?\n\nThere’s no visible harm with listening to music all day, but it would likely impact your long term future by affecting your potentials for happiness and maintaining a healthy relationship with others.\n\nTry meditation, start with guided meditation and aim for silent meditation. If your thoughts are killing you, it might be worth getting yourself checked sometimes in the future. It’s common for ADHD patients but don’t fall into the self diagnosis trap that is becoming very prevalent these days.",

          "text": "The “break your day into 4 days” idea can work, but not because it magically creates time. It works because it creates psychological resets.\n\nInstead of thinking “this whole day is overwhelming,” you think in blocks. Morning block. Midday block. Afternoon block. Evening block. Each one has its own tiny win condition. When one block ends, you mentally close it and start fresh.\n\nWhat’s helped me more than anything though is defining what makes a day successful before it starts. If everything feels important, your brain freezes. So I pick one primary task that, if done, makes the day a win. Everything else is secondary.\n\nAlso, when I feel like I’m drowning, it’s usually because my task list is unstructured. I’ll do a quick brain dump, then sort into three buckets: must do, should do, nice to do. Most of the stress drops once I see that not everything is urgent.\n\nAnother underrated tactic is setting a clear stop time. If there’s no boundary, work expands forever and you never feel caught up. A defined shutdown ritual helps your brain relax.\n\nIf you’re consistently overwhelmed, it might not be a tactics issue. It might be a volume issue. Sometimes productivity isn’t about squeezing more out of the day. It’s about cutting something.",

If I finish it, cool, that block was solid. The rest is extra. Otherwise you just spend the day moving things around and feeling busy but nothing really done. Been there.\n\nTimers help too. Not in a robotic way. Just 30 or 45 mins, phone away, do the thing. When it rings I stand up even if I don’t want to. It kind of resets your head. Like shaking an Etch A Sketch.\n\nAlso random but vague tasks are the worst. Work on business means nothing. Write 200 words means something. Your brain needs edges.\n\nMost days aren’t about being super productive anyway. It’s just about not spiralling. Keep it simple. Win small blocks. Repeat.",

Awake\n2. Asleep\n\nWithin the waking part of our day, I like to group things into 3 imaginary buckets:\n\n1. **Work** (job, school, chores, etc.)\n2. **Passion** (hobbies etc.)\n3. **Play** (unplug & do whatever)\n\nThis means:\n\n* I have a limited time budget each day, so I can't do *everything*\n* I have a limited energy budget each day, so I have to be selective about *what* I work on & *when* I work on it because my energy isn't always available\n* I have to be *selective* about which steps I choose to add to my day\n\nImagine a room with 2 items on the wall:\n\n1. A blank chalkboard\n2. A blank whiteboard\n\nThe title of the chalkboard is \"ROO Pressure\", which stands for:\n\n1. Responsibilities\n2. Opportunities\n3. Obligations\n\nThis creates \"emotional prioritization\", where we feel **pressured** to do things.  Instead, we can choose to use \"logical prioritization\", which is where we pick steps from the ROO chalkboard, or rather, manually approve what we choose to add to our personal whiteboard.  This allows us **vote** each item in by *choice*, not by *emotional pressure*.  The difference is:\n\n* We work on *selected steps*, NOT ideas\n* We select a finite number of steps in order to create a realistic daily schedule\n* WE dictate priority based on the order we put each step in.  Low priority = fewer steps later in the day; high-priority = more steps earlier in the day.  NOT based on how how much *emotional pressure* we are receiving internally!\n\nFour steps to task execution:\n\n1. Use reliable reminders (calendar entries, multiple named alarms, etc.)\n2. Have a clean, prepared workstation\n3. Use, literally, *written* tasks\n4. Use a body double (#1 productivity tool!!)\n\nImagine the opposite:\n\n* *Zero* written assignments\n* Exposure to ALL assignments (\"drinking from the firehose\" = overwhelming)\n* No preselected, finite list of tasks that can ne realistically achieved today (otherwise we create literally Failure Mode in our minds)\n* List not put in order of importance\n* No reminders\n* Messy workstation where the tools & supplies aren't ready to go\n* Work without the help needed to stay on track (working solo allows our brain to let us off the hook!)\n\nOur job is simply to manage OUR blank whiteboard:\n\n* What steps are we *willing* to vote into that blank space today?\n* Are we willing to *manually prioritize* via sequential ordering?\n* Are we willing to be **selective** about how many steps we pick each day, in order to create a realistically-achievable schedule?\n\nEvery project gets done by steps.  If we want to maximize our success, we need to choose HOW to be successful every day.  I unwittingly let **emotional prioritization** run my life for *most* of my life, simply because I didn't know HOW to do better!!",

I know that a natural response would probably be that it means that \"thats because your home must feel like your safe space and hence your body relaxes\", but it feels a bit more inherently dysfunctional than that. I feel TOO fatigued at home like I feel it in my bones, and this is literally any minute of the day or night that I'm inside my home. Its almost like my home casts this veil/spell on me and then it incapacitates me from even being able to do the simplest of tasks. Like I feel like I don't even have the strength to pick up two items, or sometimes to even get up and shower or pour a cup of water, and sometimes the tiredness even turns into physical symptoms like a headache. I literally almost feel drugged when im at home. And it stresses me out to see the mess my place has become because of it, because I cant function enough to think as clearly or clean at all. \n\nNow on the other hand, when im at work or any one elses house, I clean like a professionally paid cleaner, do it super fast and well, and also become super efficient at tackling tasks. I literally become super woman compared to the completely different incapacitated me within any inch inside of my home.  \n\nWhy is that ? and I would really love to fix it so that I can be just as high functioning in my own home. My home and I deserve it just as much \n\nEven right now as I type this on my couch I feel so weak and sleepy (both physically and mentally) that its uncomfortable to keep on typing in between. I literally feel like a shell of myself and its even physical, my brain even feels like it got cut off of 50% of its ability and strength and im fighting to stay alert. As I mentioned, I feel drugged when I'm at home and I dont take anything \n\nIs this .... normal? Any insights you can share with me that might give me some answers ?

The sharp contrast suggests it’s situational, not laziness. Try changing one variable at home and see if your energy shifts.",

I’m wondering if it’s easier to clean other people’s spaces than our for multiple reasons: 1) there’s a third party person whom you feel accountable to, 2)there’s a set to-do list/expectations are clear and defined, 3) there’s a time limit, 4) there’s an incentive (emotional: care about the relationship w/person who’s house you’re at, financial: paid for working, etc), 5) burnout (ADHD/Autism peeps struggle more frequently), 6)underlying perfectionism.\n\nI do believe there’s a lot of shame embedded in the language we use (hint: “should”= “shame”). If you’re like me, I struggle keeping promises with my self, and people-please and over-extend myself often. Looking around my home in slightly less disarray currently than 3 months ago, reframing the “I should be cleaning” to “I deserve a clean and functional home too” has helped make more progress all around our property than in the past 5 living here. Granted, I still stress myself out from wanting to do all of the things/home improvements/garden projects all at once right now and cry a little on the inside that I’m not currently independently wealthy and able to hire out these projects to see the progress I want to see on a short timeframe…. \n\nFind small ways to work on trusting yourself and what you say you’ll do and actually do it. Start small. Let the momentum snowball. Find a body double or invite a friend over (either to help or to motivate you to clean to baseline). Define goals and associate them with incentive, define time parameters/deadline, narrow down scope for milestones, and then execute the plan consistently. The frequency of “consistency” is what’s sustainable for you (5 min a day, 20 min every 3 days, etc). My goals don’t care about my feelings but sometimes, I really can’t do anything and that’s okie too. Give yourself grace for struggling, and rely on discipline over motivation. Habits are built by the discipline to be in consistent action; motivation just inspires the goal. \n\nRooting for you! Remember if you’re riding the struggle bus, you’re still moving forward.

Playing tennis and singing are the main things. I spent a lot of time practicing those in my youth and have great memories, whilst there is still room for improvement. These are giving me great joy.\n\nI think this really depends where you are at in life. I have two young kids, wife in depression, digging ourselves out of a financial hole, so this works for me.",

Having a routine, and having thought through how you can make this routine so that is easy to keep, helps. \"Atomic habits\" might help you here. I do NOT always feel like sitting down with something that is hard and requires a lot of focus when I have had a full day at work and kids have been in Challenging Mode all afternoon. And that is when routines comes in. I have set things up so it is easy to get started - I have focused on removing obstacles, making it easy to do, and so on. ",

Not tired exactly. Just empty.\n\nWhat didn't work: willpower, motivation videos, \"just 5 minutes\" advice. My brain wasn't refusing the task. It genuinely had nothing left after the workday took everything.\n\nWhat eventually helped: I moved practice to before work. 6:30 AM, 20 minutes, before my brain had spent anything on the day. The quality of those sessions was completely different. I also stopped trying to hit every day. 3 good sessions a week beats 5 forced ones where I'm just going through motions.\n\nThe logistics that actually matter: pick a time when your brain is fresh (probably morning), make it short enough that it doesn't feel like another obligation, and give yourself permission to skip without guilt. Consistency over time beats daily grinding.\n\n",

Well turns out this \"bad\" feature was a blessing in disguise as now, due to it, I started closing Instagram whenever I get such an ad break.  \nI suggest anyone struggling with scrolling on Instagram to try turning off personalised adds and forcing these ad breaks on themself as it just might help!  \n  \nNote: I'm not a heavy doomscrolled, but using Instagram for the chats had me going down rabbit holes of scrolling when I just wanted to respond to a message, so this feature helped me.",
