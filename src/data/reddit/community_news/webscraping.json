So it's always under heavy testing from me; most of the time, I find issues before users report them because of that.\n\nRegarding security, before switching to Web Scraping, I spent about 8 years in the information security field, including bug hunting. So I was an ethical hacker before all of that. And I spent some time working as backend.",

But then they pass back js that profiles the browser apis to suspicious requests and the payload in that js is constantly changing. So at least for those requests you would need to either mock the entire surface of the browser Api and return what they would consider reasonable values (at that point just using a browser is likely far easier). Won’t say it’s 100% not possible but unless your trick is proxying through some other process that is actually getting around all the protection you won’t be bypassing  cloudflare or Akami purely with requests.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\n  \nI used Python Requests and bs4 and sometimes Selenium to write web scraping scripts to web scrape course catalogs.\n\nHeres a small part of Stanfords.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hngsv9w8dekg1.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=20a86e74eeb460ddea53188184c4bdf190c5602d\n\nThen created a system to organize the data, put it in databases, query some statistics, and pipeline it into html files which I present on a website I created, called DegreeView.\n\n  \nI am not selling anything on the site. Its ***currently*** just a project.\n\n  \nThis allowed me to get the number of courses and departments in a universities course catalog, the longest and shortest coursename, and sort all departments by how many courses they have revealing the biggest and smallest departments. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c92z8zaeeekg1.png?width=2926&format=png&auto=webp&s=d67f2dcaff5918d0a05d13890883de45669c96b6\n\n  \nAnd create a page for each department in the course catalog where I do something similar:\n\n* Get the number of courses in the department\n* The shortest and longest course name\n* Other things like what percent are upper-division courses, what percent are lower, and what percent are grad courses\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d8gz568feekg1.png?width=2890&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff20bf4324107446c81debdd588deb8accff44ad\n\nFor each university I have to write a custom web scraping script but the general structure of every universities catalog I have scraped is similar, so I haven't had to change too much for any one of them. The hardest was the first one I did, UT Austin, and also the real hardest part was creating the system that handles everything once the data is obtained and allows me to work with differentiating data across different universities. \n\n  \nAlso Stanford was hard to scrape cause I had to use Selenium to get Javascript rendered data.\n\n  \nWeb scraping is definitely the backbone of this project so hopefully some of you guys here find this interesting. \n\nThe only reason I kept this project going and didn't give up is because I always had in my mind that it would be very scalable, and I think it is. I just need to do more web scraping.\n\n  \nCheck out the site at [degreeviewsite.com](https://www.degreeviewsite.com/)",

I reached out to the site owner and got explicit permission to scrape the content for my personal project – they said it's fine since the lyrics are mostly public domain or user-contributed, and they're okay with it as long as I don't overload the server.\n\nThe problem is, there's no public API available. I asked if they could provide one or even a data dump, but they replied something like: \"Sorry, I don't have time to set up an API or export the database right now. Just build your own scraper, it's straightforward since the site is simple HTML.\"\n\nI don't have much experience with web scraping, but I know Python and want to do this ethically (with delays, user-agent, etc.). Can you recommend some beginner-friendly tools or libraries?\n\n* Preferably Python-based (like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium if needed for JS).\n* Free/open-source.\n* Tips on handling pagination (site has multiple pages per artist) and extracting lyrics cleanly (they're in tags).\n* Any anti-scrape best practices to avoid issues, even with permission?\n\nGoal is to pull all lyrics into a JSON/CSV for my app. Thanks in advance!\n\n(If anyone has scraped similar sites, share your code snippets or gotchas!)",

Then paste those into ChatGPT/Claude with something like \"write me a Python scraper using requests + BeautifulSoup that extracts lyrics from this structure\" and share the HTML snippet. You'll get a working script in one shot that you can tweak from there.\n\nLLMs are surprisingly good at generating scrapers for static HTML sites. You describe the page structure, it writes the code. For a beginner this is the fastest path — you'll learn the patterns as you adjust the output.\n\nA few tips:\n- Use `encoding='utf-8'` everywhere — especially if the site has Turkish/Arabic text\n- Wrap each request in `try/except` so one failure doesn't kill the run\n- If pagination is per-artist, scrape the artist index first then loop through each\n\nFor a simple HTML site with permission, `requests` + `bs4` is all you need. No heavy frameworks.\n\nHope this helps!",

          "text": "When scraping sites \"ethically\" when you've already been given permission, I'd say the main point is don't bring down the site. If we use ahref's traffic checker the site gets around 31,000 requests per month or around 0.7 requests to a webpage on its site per minute. This would mean depending on the site it would either be okay to spam 1000 requests per minute if they have a good backend or that could seem like a DDOS attack. Use your judgement and make a reasonable number of requests if using your own IP and know that perhaps different times have more traffic than other times.\n\nFor Scraping the site itself, you could use something simple like the following:  \n\\- Python Requests Library for making http requests.\n\n\\- Beautifulsoup for parsing the resulting html files.\n\nIf you need to get a list of all pages, the site has a sitemap. In the sitemap there are a list of links which lead to other links, though it does not give pagination: [https://ilahisozleri.net/sitemap.html](https://ilahisozleri.net/sitemap.html). You could create a script first to collect all pages by:\n\n\\- Making a request to the sitemap and then collecting each page. In the html, which you can find from clicking F12 you can see that each link is contained within a <a> element contained within a <td> element. You can then parse through and get each link and then use requests to visit these URLs and beautifulsoup to parse it.\n\nYou'll need to study the sitemap to see if it has everything you need.\n\nFor pagination, it seems the site may be quite simple. For example on [https://ilahisozleri.net/sanatci/hasan-dursun](https://ilahisozleri.net/sanatci/hasan-dursun) it seems that all pages are in elements underneath the class \"pages\". You can parse the URLs from the href for the next page, go to the next page, and then keep going until there are no more pages left.\n\nThe site itself doesn't seem to have many anti-bot defenses (no cloudflare, akamai, etc), and you can get to the site without the use of Javascript. If anything I think the only potential issue could be rate limiting or IP bans if you go crazy on the site with your own IP --> you can also purchase proxies to make your requests from multiple places.\n\nI'd say first make a script to make to an artist page using requests library and ensure you can collect the correct data from it by parsing it (URL's to song pages). After that make the script to collect the lyrics from the page and test it on a few pages. Once you've done that and gotten parsing down for these and getting the pages you can proceed to create the logic to collect from multiple pages.\n\nEdit: This is but one of many ways to go about it but there is so much more. If you don't know how to find elements in the developer tools you'll need to in order to correctly use any html parser to find the correct data.",

I applied for the official API access using my institute email but my request was rejected. So I tried alternate methods such as Pushshift but it seems to have been restricted now. Also tried using reddit's JSON endpoints but that only gave me around 1000 of the most recent posts of a sub. Im trying to get all posts in 2024 and 2025 so that method doesnt work for me. Also tried using selenium on old reddit but havent been successful so far.  \n  \nDoes anyone have any suggestions for alternative methods to scrape subreddits or tips on how to get official API access? Any help would be appreciated!",

Was wondering if anyone experienced can provide some advice/tips.\n\n**What I’m doing**\n\nUse a stealth browser (e.g., nodriver) to load the target page and complete whatever Cloudflare presents (no issues with this, i get the cf bypassed and cf clearance cookie).\n\nAfter the browser run, I extract cookies (notably cf_clearance, plus any other set cookies) and then switch to a lightweight HTTP client (curl-cffi) for the actual requests.\n\nThe browser is pinned to a specific UA / UA-latest (e.g., “Chrome v144” UA string).\n\nIn curl-cffi, I attach the cookie jar + headers and use an impersonation profile like impersonate=\"chrome-latest\".\n\n**The issue**\n\nEven with the cookies present, several times the curl-cffi request still gets hit with a Cloudflare challenge again even though the cookies has not expired (could have been just retrieved 5 seconds ago).\n\n**any idea why this is happening? my current hypothesis right now is -**\n\nIs this happening because the clearance/session is bound to signals beyond cookies, like:\n\n* UA + TLS fingerprint mismatch (stealth browser chrome-latest profile might be say “Chrome 144” vs curl-cffi “chrome-latest” might be Chrome 143 or something?)\n* Or could it be something else?\n\nQuestions\n\n* How important is it to match the stealth browser version with the curl-cffi version? If this is indeed the underlying issue, whats the best way to \"synchronize\" the chrome version profile in the stealth browser vs the curl-cffi chrome version profile it is using? I don't want to pin it specifically to a version like chrome v144 because then i have to go every single time and update the version manually (and if the version gets too old it likely will trigger an anti-bot challenge as well).\n\n* Is this potential mismatch an issue, or is curl-cffi just not great and triggers the cf challenge often?",

But also the order. What curl-cffi does for you, is spoof the same TLS algorithms/options and HTTP header values, including the orderening.\n\nNow there is 1 caveat: some TLS browsers (Chrome‚ do some \"greasing\" to randomize TLS order iirc. But HTTP does not. So there are various fingerprints like JA3 and JA4(H) that represents these properties.\n\nWAF look at these properties to determine if a browser is real. If any of these is off, its a giant red flag. TLS and HTTP fingerprints don't change per user or OS, but it can change per browser type and version.\n\nOne problem with curl-cffi though: the spoofing is quite static. And in their infinite wisedom in the latest versions, they're hard coding their headers \\*inside\\* the curl executable.\n\nSec-Fetch-Dest for example, specifies what kind of page the browser is expecting to be requested. For HTML pages this is \"document\", but for CSS, javascript or images this is different. Even iframes get denoted as such. I personally haven't encountered many sites that directly blocks access if you get these wrong (maybe video embeds that get denied if you open that page in a separate tab).. but I won't be surprised if some WAF monitor these headers for bot detection, and we'll see more 403's if you get them wrong.",

When curl-cffi sends `impersonate=\"chrome-latest\"`, its TLS handshake might present Chrome 131 ciphers while your browser was fingerprinted as Chrome 144. Cloudflare sees the mismatch and re-challenges.\n\nFixes:\n\n1. **Pin both to the same Chrome version explicitly.** Annoying to maintain but reliable.\n2. **Check what curl-cffi supports.** Run `curl_cffi.requests.BrowserType` — if latest is `chrome124` and your browser is on 144, there's always a gap.\n3. **Skip the split.** Keep everything in the headless browser and use its network layer directly.\n4. **If you must split:** Extract JA3/JA4 fingerprint from your browser session and compare to curl-cffi's output.\n\nAlso watch HTTP/2 pseudo-header order — Cloudflare checks that too.",

Two weeks later my hyper focus has me deep in this.\n\nSo far Ive built about a dozen tools for different sites at different difficulty levels and theyve worked... mostly. Now I hit a site that seems like it might require a proxy.\n\nBut my real question is not just “should I use a proxy” ..its how do you reason about access patterns and anti-bot defenses before deciding to add infrastructure like proxies?\n\nE.g. Recently I ran into another harder site and most advice online just said use proxies. I didnt want to jump straight to paying for infrastructure so I kept digging. Eventually I found a post suggesting trying the mobile app. I did a MITM looked at the mobile API and that ended up working with a high success rate.\n\nThat made me realize if I had just followed the first advice I saw I wouldnt have learned anything.\n\nSo how do you decide when something truly requires proxies versus when you just havent found the right access pattern yet. Are there signals you look for or is it mostly experience.",

More and more apps have anti-bot protected endpoints to the point the MITM gets detected straight away unless you're using an actual Android device connected through ADB to your computer.\n\nMy rule of thumb is, you ONLY use proxies when you need to scale or you need more concurrent requests and you start getting blocked because of that usage pattern. It doesn't make sense to start using proxies if you can't reliably bypass protections first.\n\nAlso don't go straight for \"residential\" or \"mobile\" proxies. Try cheap datacenter proxies first, they can take you very far for quite a lot of things!! But of course they have their limitations too, mainly due to their IP reputation. For example, in your use case, since I'm guessing you found an unprotected endpoint, they might still have some rate limiting in place, so you'll get 429's pretty often, the way to bypass that is to have for example 100 datacenter proxies and making requests in each of those proxies. If you found out that the limit of requests per IP is of about 50 reqs/min, then you can have 50 reqs/min \\* amount of proxies you have.",

Now I'm not hammering sites like I'm DDOSing them -- but more like: ooh I've launched 3 jobs in parallel? Oh well, I'm not getting 429 (Too Many Requests) so everything just sails smoothly.\n\nAnd its not like most of my scrapers run jobs that often (most of them only have to complete once a day, some on a hourly basis).\n\nBut still, I do have a few that launches the indexer every 1-2min. And then on top comes new content to grab, plus any images, ajax data, etc. on top. It all adds up and even though I could set really long delays between everything, its still nice to see everything being pulled in swiftly with minimal latency.\n\nAnother advantage: if one IP does get blocked for some duration, I'm not bothered about it at all. All my scripts auto-retry failed jobs. If I'm scraping from 1 IP, 24/7, refreshing the index every 2 minutes.. yeah I'm guessing I will be blocked within a few hours to days. So this is also about redundancy than necessary to function.\n\nFood for thought: if you rely on one proxy provider, and for whatever reason that provider goes down, they are getting blocked by Cloudflare, or they pull the plug for their service, what do you do? At present, I'm DIY'ing a lot of my proxy management, rotation and cloudflare challenges. But inevitably that script will break someday and even though I've redundant proxies, I do not have redundant scraping strategies. So I'm thinking about adding 1 or even 2 tiers of backup strategies in case that fails. Things like scraping APIs that promise a turn-key solution for grabbing HTML from the web, but cost a lot more $$$ per request. But for commercial jobs, it may be worth using if a script falls over on the weekend or holiday due to some (semi-)foreseeable cause.",
