      "text": "Most of the HTTP clients like requests in python gets easily flagged by Cloudflare and such. Specially when it comes to HTTP/3 there are almost no good libraries which has native spoofing like chrome. So I got a little frustated and had built this library in Golang. It mimics chrome from top to bottom in all protocols. This is still definitely not fully ready for production, need a lot of testing and still might have edge cases pending. But please do try this and let me know how it goes for you - [https://github.com/sardanioss/httpcloak](https://github.com/sardanioss/httpcloak) \n\n  \nThanks to cffi bindings, this library is available in Python, Golang, JS and C#\n\nIt mimics Chrome across HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 - matching JA4, Akamai hash, h3\\_hash, and ECH. Even does the TLS extension shuffling that Chrome does per-connection.. Won't help if they're checking JS execution or browser APIs - you'd need a real browser for that. \n\nIf there is any feature missing or something you'd like to get added just lemme know. I'm gonna work on  tcp/ip fingerprinting spoofing too once this lib is stable enough. \n\nIf this is useful for you or you like it then please give it a star, thankyou!",

Lastly the bs about cookies and verify and such is completely wrong, it supports them and works with them without any issue at all. And yes it does supports proxies. Lastly if you read my post carefully - \"This is still definitely not fully ready for production, need a lot of testing and still might have edge cases pending. But please do try this and let me know how it goes for you\" I never said this is ready for production and I want people to use it so they may let me know the issues present in it and fix them properly.

I managed to collect around 7,000 records and everything worked as expected.\n\nI’m curious whether this is considered a decent start for someone new to scraping, or if it’s fairly basic stuff.  \nAlso, I’d like to hear honest opinions: is web scraping still worth investing time in today (for projects, automation, or monetization), or is it becoming a waste of time due to market saturation and restrictions?\n\nAny real-world experiences or insights would be appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Lots of freelancers from Indonesia, India, Central / South America, Eastern Europe have gotten into it in the past 5-10 years and they do it for cheaper than \"first world\" (sorry, not sure on what the best term is here) countries due to cost of living.\n\nFor most clients, cost is their primary concern, then quality, then speed. If they've had quality issues before, quality will be their biggest concern.\n\nThere's still a huge demand for data, and most SaaS products today are data backed. Those are recurring scrapes where data is pushed hourly or daily into databases for further processing. There's a lot of demand for scraping products that have barriers like LinkedIn, TikTok etc. because they are annoying to deal with and are actively hostile to scraping (which is their right).",

Make the file your url list. Make the upload trigger a script that launches a small fargate instance that shuts down when it’s done. 0.25 vcpu and 256m of ram.

There's ways to make this setup more metadata-driven too, as you can parameterize Azure Pipelines and use the Azure DevOps API to trigger runs, and you can easily tack on Azure Logic Apps (4000 free actions per month) as a simple orchestrator, use any kind of blob or table storage (even Google Drive) to store and fetch your metadata table containing the schedules and info about which scripts to run. Might be overkill for your needs though, but it's honestly one of the easiest and cheapest ways I've found to run headless browsers.",

This raises a few fundamental questions for me.\n\nAt an intuitive level, it seems possible to:\n\n* add randomness (scrolling, delays, mouse movement),\n* simulate exploration instead of direct actions,\n* or hide client-side activity,\n\nand therefore make an automated actor look human.\n\nBut in practice, this approach seems to break down very quickly.\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand is **why**, and whether people actually solve this problem differently today.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. **Why doesn’t adding randomness make automation behave like a real human?** What parts of human behavior (intent, context, timing, correlation) are hard to reproduce even if actions look human on the surface?\n2. **What do modern platforms analyze beyond basic signals like IP, cookies, or user-agent?** At a conceptual level, what kinds of behavioral patterns make automation detectable?\n3. **Why isn’t hiding or masking client-side actions enough?** Even if visual interactions are hidden, what timing or state-level signals still reveal automation?\n4. **Is this problem mainly technical, or statistical and economic?** Is human-like automation theoretically possible but impractical at scale, or effectively impossible in real-world conditions?\n5. **From an OSINT perspective, how is platform data actually collected today?**\n   * Do people still use automation in any form?\n   * Do they rely more on aggregated or secondary data sources?\n   * Or is the work mostly manual and selective?\n6. **Are these systems truly being “bypassed,” or are people simply avoiding platforms and using different data paths altogether?**\n\nI’m not looking for instructions on bypassing protections.  \nI want to understand **how behavioral detection works at a high level**, what it can and cannot infer, and what **realistic, sustainable approaches** exist if the goal is insight rather than evasion.\n\n**Note:**  \nSorry in advance — I used AI assistance to help write this question. My English isn’t strong enough to clearly express technical ideas, but I genuinely want to understand how these systems work.",

Your field is incredibly challenging. \n\nThe reason I said bot detection is easy after the fact, is that you then have the time needed to analyze behavioral traits and complex data, and for the relevant data to exist in the first place. \n\nOnce the data exists, it’s easy to spot if you want a quarterly summary of “who was a bot”. But this is different than blocking bots in real time. \n\nLet’s say I load Facebook, login, and start looking for group names with the goal of finding all relevant groups related to {keyword_list}. \n\nLoading Facebook is normal, logging in is normal, triggering the autocomplete is normal. \n\nWhat is abnormal, is that every time I login, I go immediately to the groups tab and trigger this autocomplete. Or that I spend X time on the groups page, vs Y on the feed. Or one of many non behavioral indicators (mismatch between events firing and device type, etc)\n\nThat takes time to develop, and resources to summarize individually. It takes even more resources to summarize what “normal” is.\n\nThere are not many places that can do this in realtime, for every page load, before sending response headers, or before the bots have already done significant work.",

Today, my first approach is reverse engineering exposed backend APIs whenever possible.\n\nI have successfully reverse engineered Amazon’s search API, Instagram’s profile API and DuckDuckGo’s `/html` endpoint to extract raw JSON data. This approach is far easier to parse than HTML and significantly more resource efficient compared to full browser automation.\n\nThat said, I’m also realistic. Not every website exposes usable API endpoints. In those cases, I fall back to traditional browser automation or crawler based solutions to meet business requirements.\n\nIf you ever need clean, structured spreadsheets filled with reliable data, I’m confident I can deliver. I charge nothing upfront and only ask for payment once the work is completed and approved.\n\n**How I approach a project**\n\n* You clarify the data you need such as product name, company name, price, email and the target websites.\n* I audit the sites to identify exposed API endpoints. This usually takes around 30 minutes per typical website.\n* If an API is available, I use it. Otherwise, I choose between browser automation or crawlers depending on the site. I then share the scraping strategy, estimated infrastructure costs and total time required.\n* Once agreed, you provide a BRD or I create one myself, which I usually do as a best practice to stay within clear boundaries.\n* I build the scraper, often within the same day for simple to mid sized projects.\n* I scrape a 100 row sample and share it for review.\n* After approval, you provide credentials for your preferred proxy and infrastructure vendors. I can also recommend suitable vendors and plans if needed.\n* I run the full scrape and stop once the agreed volume is reached, for example 5000 products.\n* I hand over the data in CSV, Google Sheets and XLSX formats along with the scripts.\n\nOnce everything is approved, I request the due payment. For one off projects, we part ways professionally. If you like my work, we continue collaborating on future projects.\n\nA clear win for both sides.\n\nIf this sounds useful, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishwas-batra/) or just send me a DM here.",

(NVIDIA) with no broken dimensions.\n* **Stack Traces:** `PHANTOM_OVERFLOW` depth and error names match real Chrome behavior.\n\n🛠 The Repos\n\n* [**chaser-oxide**](https://github.com/ccheshirecat/chaser-oxide)– Chromiumoxide fork with stealth/impersonation patches.\n* [**chaser-cf**](https://github.com/ccheshirecat/chaser-cf)– Rust implementation for Cloudflare Turnstile.\n* [**chaser-gt**](https://github.com/ccheshirecat/chaser-gt)– GeeTest solver using deobfuscation (via `rquests`/`curl_cffi`).\n\n**Note:** I shipped these with **C FFI bindings**, so you can use them in **Python, Go, or Node** if you just want the Rust performance/stealth without writing Rust code. I personally prefer this over managing a separate microservice.\n\n💬 Curious about your workflows:\n\n1. **Third-party APIs:** For those using paid solvers (Capsolver, etc.), is it for the convenience, or because you don't want to maintain stealth patches yourself?\n2. **Scraping Use Cases:** What are you guys actually building? I’ll go first: I’m overengineering automation for crypto casinos because I found some gaps in their flow lol.\n3. **Differentiators:** What actually makes a solver \"good\" in 2026? Is it raw solve speed, or just the success rate on high-entropy challenges?\n\nIt’s still early, so feel free to contribute, roast my code, or reach out to collaborate. Happy New Year!",

Well, I finally finished it and published it to PyPI.\n\nIt’s called **PNSEA** (Python NSE API). It’s an open-source library for fetching data from the National Stock Exchange of India without getting hit by the dreaded `403 Forbidden` or rate-limit blocks.\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\n* **Stealth by Default:** Uses my `stealthkit` wrapper (curl\\_cffi) to rotate TLS fingerprints and headers, making requests look like a human browsing on Chrome/Safari. I added more headers specific to NSE website to make it stealtheir.\n* **Deep Data Access:** It doesn't just do stock prices. It pulls **Insider Trading** data, Pledged shares, SAST data, and even Mutual Fund movements.\n* **Analysis Ready:** NSE’s nested JSON is a mess. This lib automatically flattens it into **Pandas DataFrames** so you can jump straight into analysis.\n* **Full FnO Support:** Easy access to Option Chains for NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, and all F&O stocks with built-in filtering.\n\n**Why did I create it?** I’ve been an FnO trader and dev for years. Most existing NSE wrappers are either outdated, stop working after a week due to blocks, or require you to manually handle cookies and headers every time the NSE website updates its security.\n\nSince all my projects from my Amazon scraper to my finance apps rely on high-quality data, I wanted a \"set it and forget it\" solution for the Indian market. PNSEA is the result of that frustration.\n\n**Pypi:** [https://pypi.org/project/pnsea/](https://pypi.org/project/pnsea/)\n\n**Github:** [https://github.com/theonlyanil/pnsea](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/theonlyanil/pnsea)\n\n**Target Audience** Algo traders, financial analysts, and developers who are tired of their NSE scrapers breaking every time the site refreshes its bot protection.\n\n**Comparison** Unlike other wrappers that use standard `requests` or `urllib`, this uses browser impersonation natively. It also provides corporate governance data (insider trading) which is usually hidden behind multiple clicks or premium paid APIs.\n\nCheckout its usage on my personal website where I show [insider trading data in a dashboard](https://theonlyanil.com/finance/apps/insider-trading).\n\nIt’s open source, so feel free to fork it, add features, or let me know if you find an endpoint that’s missing!",

      "text": "I'm writing a C# docker application that rotates proxies automatically and performs the requests for some scrapers I run at home. The program adds lots of instrumentation to optimize reliability. (It stores time-series data on latency, bandwidth, proxy/server-side rejects for each individual proxy+site combination, effectively resulting in each individual site rotating through its own proxy pool)\n\nObviously I need to do some kind of TLS spoofing to support the more tricky websites. I also want to rotate user-agent with a distribution of browser versions *and* OS versions. I've already got some market share databased on caniuse and statcounter..\n\nNow I need a library that can actually execute these browser impersonations. I've been using lexiforest/curl-impersonate, but it falls short on several fronts. I need to customize the user-agent and some other platform-specific headers.. however their recent additions hard-coded profiles into the executable. Even though the documentation outlines I should customize their standard scripts to do this!\n\nUnfortunately, if I run curl with an extra -H 'User agent: ..' it wont replace but send the user-agent header twice.\n\nI've looked at this for a little while, but I'm fearing this change dead ends this project pretty hard.\n\nOf course I could customize it, as the author points everyone to do so.. However scraping is a hobby not my work, so when things need updating, it may not get fixed for days to weeks. I liked using ready-built executables, so I can grab the latest impersonate profiles & market share data on a cronjob..\n\nI've looked at other projects like wreq and rnet, but these are just a Rust crate and/or Python bindings. Not quite what I'm looking for.. although maybe a C# FFI is possible. It does look to be much more comprehensive and actively maintained (more browser profiles, split up by OS etc.)\n\nHowever, before spending a bunch of time on either curl-impersonate or a C#-wreq FFI bridge, is there any other library I missed out on during my Reddit/Google search?",

Then your warranty is tied to the original scope and not allowing anyone to weasel or strong arm you into warranty that is actually new scope.\n\nWarranty duration? That's more difficult to answer and probably depends on the size of the original contract and quality of the customer. Warranties are worth charging for - they are NOT free. Perhaps something like 30-60 days after go-live is achieved?\n\nIf you're scraping then THINGS CHANGE that's part of the business. Your scope of work/contract should call out the risk of change to the source data/websites and those are out of your control. I'd say those are NOT warranty because your software didn't break, something else changed.\n\nCharging a monthly retainer is a decent idea and it can include a fixed number of use-it-or-lose-it hours to use at the customers discretion.",

      "text": "Hello, dear community!\n\nI’ve got an issue being detected by DataDome (403 status) while scraping a big resource.\n\n\n\n**What works**\n\nI use Zendriver pointing to my local MacOS Chrome. Navigating to site’s main page -> waiting for the DataDome endpoint that returns DataDome token -> making subsequent requests via curl\\_cffi (on my local MacOS machine) with that token being sent as a DataDome cookie.  \nI’ve checked that this token lives quite long - is valid for at least several hours, but assume even more (managed to make requests after multiple days).\n\n\n\n**What I want to do that doesn’t work**\n\nI want to deploy it and opted for Docker. Installed Chrome (not Chromium) within the Docker. Tried the same algorithm as above. The outcome is that I’m able to get token from the DataDome endpoint. But subsequent curl\\_cffi requests fail with 403. Tried curl\\_cffi requests from Docker and locally - both fail, issued token is not valid.\n\nNext thing I’ve enabled xvfb that resulted in a bit better outcome. Namely, after obtaining the token the next request via curl\\_cffi succeeds, while subsequent ones fail with 403. So, it’s basically single use.\n\nNext I’ve played with different user agents, set timezone, but the outcome is the same.\n\n\n\nOne more observation - there’s another request which exposes DataDome token via Set-Cookie response header. If done with Zendriver under Docker, Set-Cookie header for that same endpoint is missing.\n\nSo, my assumption is that my trust score by DataDome is higher than to show me captcha, but lower than to issue a long-living token.\n\n\n\nAnd one more observation - both locally and under Docker requests via curl\\_cffi work with 131st Chrome version being impersonated. Though, 143rd latest Chrome version is used to obtain this token. Any other curl\\_cffi impersonation options just don’t work (result in 403). Why does that happen?\n\nAnd I see that curl\\_cffi supports impersonation of the following OSes only: Win10, MacOS (different versions), iOS. So, in theory it shouldn’t work at all combined with Docker setup?\n\n\n\n**Question** \\- could you please point me in the right direction what to investigate and try next. How do you solve such deployment problems and reliably deploy scraping solutions? And probably you can share advice how to enhance my DataDome bypassing strategy?\n\n\n\nThank you for any input and advices!",

          "text": "DataDome tokens are usually bound to more than just a cookie. They often get tied to the full client “shape” (TLS and HTTP2 fingerprint, IP reputation, timing, browser signals, sometimes even local storage) so a token minted in one environment can be useless in another. That explains why local Mac works but Docker fails, and why you see “single use” behavior.\n\nWhat to investigate, at a high level:\n\n* Fingerprint consistency: the environment that mints the token needs to match the environment that reuses it. If you mint in a real Chrome and replay with curl, any mismatch in TLS or HTTP2 can invalidate quickly.\n* IP consistency: tokens can be scoped to IP or ASN. Local IP vs Docker egress often differs even on the same machine if you run through different routes.\n* Header and cookie jar completeness: missing Set-Cookie under Docker usually means the JS flow or redirects differ, or a required request wasn’t executed the same way.\n* Version coupling: the fact that only one curl\\_cffi impersonation works suggests the backend is keying on a very specific TLS stack and ordering.\n\nFor deployment, the reliable pattern is usually to keep the whole flow in one place. Either keep requests inside the same browser context that earned the session, or run the replay client with a fingerprint that is as close as possible to that browser and network path. Mixing “real browser to get token” with a very different HTTP client is where these systems tend to break.\n\nIf this is for a legitimate use case, the sustainable option is getting approved access or using an official feed. Trying to “enhance bypass” is a cat and mouse game and will keep changing.",

If you are maintaining a large and complex set of data extraction rules, Browser4 offers a hybrid data extraction approach that can potentially save you a significant amount of time.\n\nIf you also need to invoke LLM capabilities during data collection, Browser4 is an especially strong fit—for example, using LLMs to analyze pages, dynamically correct extraction rules in real time, and recover from erroneous navigations or unexpected page states.",

      "text": "Good evening! Hope this is the right place to ask. I've reached a point where I need metadata and, especially, up to date prices for Counter Strike 2 skins. I understand that there are paid APIs and the Steam API that provide real-time metadata and prices, but to be honest, I’d prefer to go with free solutions. This brings me to scrapers, since I haven’t been able to find any free APIs that meet my needs. I’ve dug through GitHub and found some repos, but most of them either don’t work with modern JavaScript heavy sites, or they only scrape limited metadata. The only repo I found that works well is [this one](https://github.com/eovacius/csgodatabase-scraper/), which returns both prices and metadata fairly quickly. However, the project is missing some content, like souvenirs, stickers, cases, etc. It looks like it’s still pretty new, so I’m sure the content will be updated soon, but I don’t want to wait too long. So, I was hoping some of you might know of any resources or public databases/sites that would let me scrape CS2 skin information. Or, if there are any other free methods to get this info without scraping, that would be super helpful too. Thanks in advance!",
