      "text": "Last couple months I was automating browser tasks on sites behind Cloudflare and reCAPTCHA. Tried various tools and solutions out there, everything either broke on the next Chrome update, got detected, or died. I was duct-taping 4 tools together and something broke every other week.\n\nSo I patched Chromium itself at the C++ source level.\n\nCloakBrowser is a small Python wrapper around a custom Chromium binary with 16 fingerprint patches compiled into the source. Not JavaScript injection, not config flags, canvas, WebGL, audio, fonts, GPU strings, all modified before compilation.\n\nResults:\n\n\\- reCAPTCHA v3: 0.9 (server-verified)  \n\\- Cloudflare Turnstile: pass (managed + non-interactive)  \n\\- BrowserScan, FingerprintJS, deviceandbrowserinfo: all clean  \n\\- 14/14 detection tests passed (full results on GitHub)\n\n    pip install cloakbrowser \n    \n    from cloakbrowser import launch \n    browser = launch() \n    page = browser.new_page()\n\nSame Playwright API, binary auto-downloads on first run (\\~200MB, cached).\n\nHow it's different from Patchright/rebrowser: those patch the protocol layer. We patch the browser itself, fingerprint values baked in at compile time. TLS matches because it IS Chrome.\n\nWhat it does NOT do: no proxy rotation, no CAPTCHA solving, no fingerprint randomization per session (yet). It's a browser, not a scraping stack. Bring your own proxies.\n\nLinux x64 right now (even inside docker)  \nmacOS coming soon (let me know if you need it, helps me prioritize).\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser](https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser)\n\nPyPI: `pip install cloakbrowser`\n\nIf you have a site that blocks everything, throw it at CloakBrowser and let me know. I like the challenge. Hardest cases welcome.  \nPro tip: pair it with a residential proxy, the browser handles fingerprints, but your IP still matters.\n\nEarly days — feedback, bugs, requests are welcome.\n\nEdit:\n\nJust shipped it! `npm install cloakbrowser` — supports both Playwright and Puppeteer  \nSame stealth binary, same 14/14 detection results. TypeScript with full types.  \n\n     // Playwright (default)\n      import { launch } from 'cloakbrowser';\n      const browser = await launch();\n      const page = await browser.newPage();\n      await page.goto('https://example.com');\n    \n      // Or with Puppeteer\n      import { launch } from 'cloakbrowser/puppeteer';\n    \n\n ",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\n  \nI used Python Requests and bs4 and sometimes Selenium to write web scraping scripts to web scrape course catalogs.\n\nHeres a small part of Stanfords.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hngsv9w8dekg1.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=20a86e74eeb460ddea53188184c4bdf190c5602d\n\nThen created a system to organize the data, put it in databases, query some statistics, and pipeline it into html files which I present on a website I created, called DegreeView.\n\n  \nI am not selling anything on the site. Its ***currently*** just a project.\n\n  \nThis allowed me to get the number of courses and departments in a universities course catalog, the longest and shortest coursename, and sort all departments by how many courses they have revealing the biggest and smallest departments. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c92z8zaeeekg1.png?width=2926&format=png&auto=webp&s=d67f2dcaff5918d0a05d13890883de45669c96b6\n\n  \nAnd create a page for each department in the course catalog where I do something similar:\n\n* Get the number of courses in the department\n* The shortest and longest course name\n* Other things like what percent are upper-division courses, what percent are lower, and what percent are grad courses\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d8gz568feekg1.png?width=2890&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff20bf4324107446c81debdd588deb8accff44ad\n\nFor each university I have to write a custom web scraping script but the general structure of every universities catalog I have scraped is similar, so I haven't had to change too much for any one of them. The hardest was the first one I did, UT Austin, and also the real hardest part was creating the system that handles everything once the data is obtained and allows me to work with differentiating data across different universities. \n\n  \nAlso Stanford was hard to scrape cause I had to use Selenium to get Javascript rendered data.\n\n  \nWeb scraping is definitely the backbone of this project so hopefully some of you guys here find this interesting. \n\nThe only reason I kept this project going and didn't give up is because I always had in my mind that it would be very scalable, and I think it is. I just need to do more web scraping.\n\n  \nCheck out the site at [degreeviewsite.com](https://www.degreeviewsite.com/)",

I reached out to the site owner and got explicit permission to scrape the content for my personal project – they said it's fine since the lyrics are mostly public domain or user-contributed, and they're okay with it as long as I don't overload the server.\n\nThe problem is, there's no public API available. I asked if they could provide one or even a data dump, but they replied something like: \"Sorry, I don't have time to set up an API or export the database right now. Just build your own scraper, it's straightforward since the site is simple HTML.\"\n\nI don't have much experience with web scraping, but I know Python and want to do this ethically (with delays, user-agent, etc.). Can you recommend some beginner-friendly tools or libraries?\n\n* Preferably Python-based (like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium if needed for JS).\n* Free/open-source.\n* Tips on handling pagination (site has multiple pages per artist) and extracting lyrics cleanly (they're in tags).\n* Any anti-scrape best practices to avoid issues, even with permission?\n\nGoal is to pull all lyrics into a JSON/CSV for my app. Thanks in advance!\n\n(If anyone has scraped similar sites, share your code snippets or gotchas!)",

Then paste those into ChatGPT/Claude with something like \"write me a Python scraper using requests + BeautifulSoup that extracts lyrics from this structure\" and share the HTML snippet. You'll get a working script in one shot that you can tweak from there.\n\nLLMs are surprisingly good at generating scrapers for static HTML sites. You describe the page structure, it writes the code. For a beginner this is the fastest path — you'll learn the patterns as you adjust the output.\n\nA few tips:\n- Use `encoding='utf-8'` everywhere — especially if the site has Turkish/Arabic text\n- Wrap each request in `try/except` so one failure doesn't kill the run\n- If pagination is per-artist, scrape the artist index first then loop through each\n\nFor a simple HTML site with permission, `requests` + `bs4` is all you need. No heavy frameworks.\n\nHope this helps!",

          "text": "When scraping sites \"ethically\" when you've already been given permission, I'd say the main point is don't bring down the site. If we use ahref's traffic checker the site gets around 31,000 requests per month or around 0.7 requests to a webpage on its site per minute. This would mean depending on the site it would either be okay to spam 1000 requests per minute if they have a good backend or that could seem like a DDOS attack. Use your judgement and make a reasonable number of requests if using your own IP and know that perhaps different times have more traffic than other times.\n\nFor Scraping the site itself, you could use something simple like the following:  \n\\- Python Requests Library for making http requests.\n\n\\- Beautifulsoup for parsing the resulting html files.\n\nIf you need to get a list of all pages, the site has a sitemap. In the sitemap there are a list of links which lead to other links, though it does not give pagination: [https://ilahisozleri.net/sitemap.html](https://ilahisozleri.net/sitemap.html). You could create a script first to collect all pages by:\n\n\\- Making a request to the sitemap and then collecting each page. In the html, which you can find from clicking F12 you can see that each link is contained within a <a> element contained within a <td> element. You can then parse through and get each link and then use requests to visit these URLs and beautifulsoup to parse it.\n\nYou'll need to study the sitemap to see if it has everything you need.\n\nFor pagination, it seems the site may be quite simple. For example on [https://ilahisozleri.net/sanatci/hasan-dursun](https://ilahisozleri.net/sanatci/hasan-dursun) it seems that all pages are in elements underneath the class \"pages\". You can parse the URLs from the href for the next page, go to the next page, and then keep going until there are no more pages left.\n\nThe site itself doesn't seem to have many anti-bot defenses (no cloudflare, akamai, etc), and you can get to the site without the use of Javascript. If anything I think the only potential issue could be rate limiting or IP bans if you go crazy on the site with your own IP --> you can also purchase proxies to make your requests from multiple places.\n\nI'd say first make a script to make to an artist page using requests library and ensure you can collect the correct data from it by parsing it (URL's to song pages). After that make the script to collect the lyrics from the page and test it on a few pages. Once you've done that and gotten parsing down for these and getting the pages you can proceed to create the logic to collect from multiple pages.\n\nEdit: This is but one of many ways to go about it but there is so much more. If you don't know how to find elements in the developer tools you'll need to in order to correctly use any html parser to find the correct data.",

Tools like patchright help but aren't perfect out of the box\n- **Cookie persistence**: Reuse cookies from a manual session where you passed. If you already have a good score tied to that session, the final click won't trigger a challenge\n\nThe 1-second window is realistic if the scoring already happened upstream and you're clean going in.\n\nI hope this helps",

One person/account in particular which drew my attention is based in Germany and uses Etsy as one of the platforms to advertise and sell. I was surprised at how much they seem to have them listed for, and knowing how much its costing me to make each one on average, it appears their is some good profit to be made. I've been doing this as a hobby more than anything up to now but It would be great if I could sell some. I have a couple listed on ebay but I wanted to try being proactive and approaching businesses which would be the most likely to buy this sort of thing... bars, pubs, restaurants. I'm looking for a way to find the email addresses for these...i assume a scraper and google maps would be the way to do this.\n\nI found a couple of free chrome extensions but neither scrape emails as part of the free version. Does anybody know of any free extensions/software... that will?\n\n  \nThanks!",

Since you're new to scraping, I'd suggest using an LLM (like ChatGPT or Claude) to help you build the whole setup step by step.\n\nThe approach:\n1. **Google Maps API** — search for pubs/bars/restaurants by location. Free tier covers small-scale searches. Ask the LLM to write you a Python script that pulls business names, addresses, phone numbers, and website URLs.\n2. **Website scraping** — have the LLM generate a second script that visits each business website and extracts email addresses from contact pages, mailto: links, etc.\n\nYou don't need to know how to code — just describe what you want to the LLM and it'll generate working scripts you can run. It can also help you set up Python on your machine if you haven't already.\n\nSkip the Chrome extensions — they're limited and unreliable. A simple script gives you full control and costs nothing.\n\nI hope this helps.",

I’m not sure what category I fall into when it comes to scraping, but I’ve done plenty of scraping projects over the years and have gained solid knowledge of how to scrape various websites.\n\nHere are some tips from my side:\n\n1. Try to avoid using browsers for scraping unless it’s absolutely necessary. Even if you have to use one, capture the request headers from the browser and try to mimic the request using those headers instead.\n2. Use residential rotating proxies for recurring scraping tasks, especially when you need to scrape a site on a daily basis.\n3. Consider integrating AI into your HTML parsing. This can save you a lot of maintenance work in the long run. Just make sure to enforce structured output.\n4. Write modular code instead of putting everything into one or two scripts. This will save you time on future projects and make maintenance easier.\n5. Use exponential backoff instead of simple retries. Even better, use exponential backoff with jitter. This helps reduce bottlenecks and handle rate limiting more effectively.\n\nIf you already have strong scraping knowledge, consider building APIs for popular websites and selling them on RapidAPI.\n\nThese are the points that come to mind right now. I’ll add more in a reply if I think of anything else.\n\nPeace ✌️",
