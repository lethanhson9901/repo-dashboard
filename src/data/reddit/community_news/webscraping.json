      "text": "Hey everyone. I built a fully asynchronous chrome driver in Python using POSIX pipes. Instead of websockets, it uses file descriptors to connect to the browser using Chrome Dev Protocol.\n\n* Directly connects and controls the browser over CDP, no middleware\n* 100% asynchronous, nothing gets blocked\n* Built completely using built-in Python asyncio \n   * Except one `deprecated` dependency for python-cdp modules\n* Best for running multiple browsers on same machine\n* No risk of zombie chromes if code crashes\n* Easy customization via class inheritance\n* No automation signatures as there is no framework in between\n\nCurrently limited to POSIX based systems only (Linux/Mac).\n\n\n\nBug reports, feature requests and contributions are welcome!\n\n\n\n[https://github.com/sohaib17/pypecdp](https://github.com/sohaib17/pypecdp)",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m working on a research project that requires building a large-scale dataset of faculty profiles from 200 to 250 business schools worldwide. For each school, I need to collect faculty-level data such as: name, title or role, department, short bio or research interests, sometimes email, CV links, publications. The aim is to systematically scrap faculty directories across many heterogeneous university websites. My current setup is like this: Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, MongoDB for storage (timestamped entries to allow longitudinal tracking), one scraper per university (100 already written. I do this with the following workflow: manually inspect the faculty directory, write Selenium logic to collect profile URLs, visit each profile and extract fields with BeautifulSoup and then store the data in mongodb. \n\nThis works, but clearly does not scale well to 200 sites, especially long-term maintenance when sites change structure. What I’m unsure about and looking for advice on is the architecture for automation. Is “one scraper per site” inevitable at this scale? Any recommendations for organizing scrapers so maintenance doesn’t become a nightmare? What are your toughts or experiences using LLMs to analyze a directory HTML, suggest Selenium actions (pagination, buttons), infer selectors?\n\nBasically my question is what you would do differently if you had to do this again for an academic project with transparency/reproducibility constraints, how would you approach it? I’m not looking for copy-paste code, more design advice, war stories, or tooling suggestions.\n\nThanks a lot, happy to clarify details if useful!",

Playwright lasts longer but scripting human-like flows, dropdown chains and confirm dialogs, feels endless. Has anyone scaled this to a hundred plus portals without losing their mind?

      "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am new to your community and web scraping in general. I have 6 years of experience in web application development but have never encountered the topic of web scraping. I became interested in this topic when I was planning to implement a pet project for myself to track prices for products that I would like to purchase in the future. That is, the idea was that I would give the application a link to a product from any online store and it, in turn, would constantly extract data from the page and check if the price had changed. I realized that I needed web scraping and I immediately created a simple web scraping on node.js using playwright without a proxy. It coped with simple pages, but if I had already tested serious marketplaces like alibaba, I was immediately blocked. I tried with a proxy but the same thing happened. Then I came across web scraping API (unfortunately I can't remember which service I used) and it worked great! But it is damn expensive. I calculated that if I use web scraping API for my application and the application will scrape each added product every 8 hours for a month, then I will pay $1 per product. That is, if I added 20 products that will be tracked, then I will pay web scraping API +- $20. This is very expensive because I have a couple of dozen different products that I would like to submit (I am a Lego fan, so I have a lot of sets that I want to buy 😄)\n\nAs a result, I thought about writing my own web scraping that would be simpler than all other web scraping APIs but at least cheaper. But I have no idea if it will be cheaper at all.\n\nCan someone with experience tell me if it will be cheaper?\n\nMobile/residential or data center proxies?\n\nI have seen many recommendations for web scraping in python, can I still write in node?\n\nIn which direction should I look?",

You are asking \"I am going to build something will be be better and cheaper than something else\". No one knows.\n\nBut you have a LOT of work todo before you can sell this service. Hitting a site once is one thing, running a service hitting 100s / 1000s of services you have captcha issues, anti bot protections etc etc.\n\nGet your system working first before you try to run and sell something that isn't working :-)\n\ngood luck",

Pay-as-you-go bandwidth pricing beats per-request, so yes - building your own will be cheaper than $20/month.\n\n  \n\\*\\*Node.js is totally fine\\*\\* - Python gets recommended a lot but Playwright works great in Node. Stick with what you know.\n\n  \nKey things for Alibaba:\n\n\\- Use residential IPs only (not datacenter)\n\n\\- If you're scraping behind login, stick to 1 account = 1 IP (don't mix IPs for the same session)\n\n\\- Block unnecessary requests (images, fonts, tracking) to keep bandwidth down\n\n\\- Add random delays between requests\n\n  \nAlibaba's bot detection is aggressive, so keep your request patterns looking human.",

If you start getting blocked after a few days, then go ahead and try proxies.  \nAs for proxies, datacenter proxies are probably good enough. Even if you get blocked 9 times out of 10 (which it should never actually be this bad), you don't need to optimize for volume at that scale, so you can afford to get blocked as long as it succeeds often enough. You should at least try datacenter proxies first to see if they are good enough, since they are much cheaper.  \nIt always depends on the sites protection, but keep in mind that for low volume, your real IP will always have a better reputation than any proxy on the market.",
