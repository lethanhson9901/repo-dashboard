      "text": "I’ve been on this sub for years, and I’m consistently surprised by how many posts ask for basic scraping help without any prior effort.\n\nIt’s rarely questions like “how do I avoid advanced fingerprinting or bot detection.” Instead, it’s almost always “how do I scrape this static HTML page.” These are problems that have been answered hundreds of times and are easily searchable.\n\nScraping can be complex, but not every problem is. When someone hasn’t tried searching past threads, Googling, or even using ChatGPT before posting, it lowers the overall quality of discussion here.\n\nI’m not saying beginners shouldn’t ask questions. But low effort questions with no context or attempted solution shouldn’t be the norm.\n\nWhat’s more frustrating are requests that implicitly expect a full pipeline. Scraping, data cleaning, storage, and reliability are not a single snippet of code. That is a product, not a quick favor.\n\nIf someone needs that level of work, the options are to invest time into learning or pay someone who already has the expertise. **Scraping is not a trivial skill. It borrows heavily from data engineering and software engineering, and treating it as free labor undervalues the work involved.**",

      "text": "Ran controlled technical SEO experiment across 12 new domains to isolate what actually moves domain authority fast versus SEO mythology. All sites launched same week with identical technical setup. Ninety days later average DA reached 28.3 with tightest performing at DA 31 and weakest at DA 24. The test methodology controlled variables to isolate technical SEO impact. All 12 sites used identical hosting (Cloudflare + Webflow), same site structure (homepage, 8 service pages, blog), identical technical optimization (Core Web Vitals, schema markup, XML sitemaps), and same backlink foundation (200 directory submissions via [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) for consistency).\n\nWeek one established technical baseline. Configured Cloudflare for speed optimization achieving 1.2s average load time. Implemented proper schema markup for Organization, Service, and Article types. Created logical URL structure with proper hierarchy. Fixed all technical issues in Search Console. Submitted to directories establishing initial backlink profile.\n\nDays 8-30 focused on content foundation. Published 8 foundational pages targeting primary keywords. Ensured proper internal linking architecture with logical topical clusters. Optimized images for speed without quality loss. All sites achieved 95+ PageSpeed scores mobile and desktop. Average DA reached 12.7 by day 30.\n\nDays 31-60 showed backlink indexing phase. Directory submissions started appearing in Search Console. Published 12 additional blog posts across all sites. Content from days 8-30 started ranking pages 2-3. Technical monitoring showed zero crawl errors. Average DA reached 21.4 by day 60.\n\nDays 61-90 demonstrated compound technical effects. Earlier content moved to page one for longtail terms. Added FAQ schema generating featured snippets for 6 sites. Implemented breadcrumb navigation improving crawlability. Optimized Core Web Vitals achieving perfect scores. Average DA reached 28.3 by day 90.\n\nPerformance variation analysis showed tight clustering. Highest performing site hit DA 31, lowest reached DA 24, with 8 sites in DA 26-29 range. The 7-point spread suggests technical baseline plus directory backlinks produces consistent results when variables are controlled. Individual content quality explained most variation.\n\nTechnical factors that correlated with higher DA were perfect Core Web Vitals scores (all three metrics green), proper schema implementation generating rich results, zero crawl errors in Search Console, logical internal linking structure, and fast initial backlink indexing within first 20 days. What surprisingly didn't impact DA significantly in 90-day window was exact hosting choice beyond basic speed, specific CMS platform (tested Webflow, Wordpress, custom), design quality or UX refinement, or social media presence. These may matter long-term but didn't affect initial DA climb.\n\nThe technical SEO lesson is new sites can reach DA 25-30 in 90 days with proper baseline. This provides foundation for content to rank and guest posting to succeed. Most sites fail because they skip technical foundation and jump to content, then wonder why nothing ranks despite \"good content.\" Cost efficiency for agencies is clear. Each site cost $127 directory service, $60 for 3 months hosting, $90 for tools (Search Console free, Ahrefs trial). Total $277 per site to establish DA 25-30 baseline. That foundation makes all subsequent SEO work more effective.\n\nFor technical SEO practitioners the recommendation is establish perfect technical baseline first (week 1), layer in directory backlinks for initial authority (weeks 2-4), publish content targeting keywords while maintaining technical excellence (weeks 5-12), and monitor Search Console religiously fixing any crawl issues immediately. The broader strategic point is technical SEO isn't glamorous but it's the foundation everything else builds on. Sites with perfect technical setup and mediocre content outperform sites with amazing content and poor technical foundation. Get the boring baseline right first.  \n",

I would prefer outright link spam to directory submissions - I do know what I’m talking about here. \n\nMost directory submission services are outright scams. The ones that do work, the results are likely to be temporary. You’re normally looking at a domain with a couple aged domains redirected back at it, supported by a few other thin directory sites, that are supported by outright link spam and other filthy links. It’s link juice laundering, and it’s fine but most site networks fall eventually. Ones that are part of paid submission packages even more rapidly.\n\nThe way it works is that normally the lowest tier of supporting site will work for a short time promoting the cleaner directory. But one by one, they get penalized and the link juice stops flowing. So for the better directory or thin site, it peaks and then has a slow fall while they build a new network of sites.",

I follow around 10–15 shops (Hunkemöller, Women’secret, Intimissimi, VS, etc.) and manually checking category pages is taking too much time.\n\nWhat I want is basically “watch these category URLs” and collect product name, product link, main photo, and current price. Then keep it organized by shop and category (bras, bodysuits, sets), and ideally notify me when prices drop.\n\nDoes something like this already exist (library, service, framework, or a common approach people use)? I’m not trying to bypass protections or do heavy scraping, just personal tracking, ideally polite and low frequency. If you’ve built something similar, what worked well for e-commerce sites?",

Sometimes, all the information gets loaded initially, you can search for application/json+ld classes in the html to see the json information. If you can't find a information regarding variant image urls in the main page, then the most easiest way without making more requests will be making image urls with reference to the base product image urls, there will be a small difference in base product and it's variant image urls like variant code or something like that. Find the information in the base product's html, however it will be hard for beginners to do so (I think). You can also track network requests and make a data pipeline to retrieve all the information. There will be a lot other ways, depending on the website. I am not entering the website as most of it's content is NSFW based. Let me know, if there is something else, you wanna ask. I will be happy to help (only for SFW).",
