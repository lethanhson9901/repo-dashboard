      "text": "Standard Selenium WebDriver implementations often face significant limitations in production environments, primarily due to blocking I/O execution patterns which increase overhead when scaling via threading. Furthermore, the lack of native, typed interfaces for Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) domains complicates low-level browser control. Additionally, standard automation signatures are easily identified by advanced anti-bot solutions through browser fingerprint analysis.\n\nTo address these issues, I have developed **osn-selenium**, an asynchronous automation framework built on top of Selenium. Specifically architected for Blink-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Yandex), it utilizes the Trio library to provide structured concurrency. The framework employs a modular Mixin-based architecture that maintains 99% backward compatibility with standard Selenium calls while exposing advanced control interfaces.\n\n**Core Technical Features:**\n\n* **Structured Concurrency (Trio):** Native integration with the Trio event loop via TrioThreadMixin, enabling efficient concurrent management of multiple browser instances.\n* **Typed CDP Executors:** High-level, typed access to all Chrome DevTools Protocol domains. This allows for real-time network request interception and response manipulation directly from Python.\n* **Advanced Fingerprint Spoofing Engine:** Features a built-in registry of over 200 parameters (Canvas, WebGL, AudioContext, etc.). Detection can be enabled in two lines of code. Supports spoofing via static/random values, static/random noise injection, and dynamic modification of value sequences. Additionally, the registry of parameters can be expanded.\n* **Dedicated dev\\_tools Package:** A module designed for background browser event processing. It features specialized loggers for CDP and fingerprinting activity, alongside advanced request interception handlers.\n* **Full Instance Wrappers:** Custom high-level wrappers for all Selenium objects including WebElements, Alerts, ShadowRoots, etc. These are 100% drop-in compatible with vanilla Selenium logic.\n* **Human-Like Interaction Layer:** Implementation of natural mouse movements using Bezier curves with jitter, smooth scrolling algorithms, and human-like typing simulation.\n\nI am currently expanding the framework's capabilities. Short-term goals include automated parameter aggregation for all flags managers, implementing higher-level logic for Network, Page, and Runtime domains in the dev\\_tools package, refining Human-Like movement patterns, and supporting a hybrid driver interface (both mixins and component-attributes). Support for additional Chromium-based browsers is also underway.\n\nThe long-term roadmap includes support for Gecko-based browsers (Firefox) and developing true internal concurrency for single browser instances using Trio memory channels and direct CDP pipe management. I am looking for technical feedback and contributors to help refine the architecture.\n\nIf you are interested in modernizing your Selenium-based infrastructure, I invite you to explore the [repository](https://github.com/oddshellnick/osn-selenium) and contribute to its development.",

I have my framework setup so it can either load resources from the live network, from a cache HAR, or a prerecorded HAR file. Any live network data gets also written into a HAR cache with some rules for how long that data can live there (for example, some \"evergreen\" content never gets invalidated, but I may change the data extraction code at a later point, so I can refresh all my data without hitting the site a million times again).\n\nBasically it means I can also write test cases and rerun them as many times as I'd like. For these prerecorded traces, I've some unit tests in place with the expected data the data extractor should return. To this end, you can also specifically record traces of 404 pages etc. and verify your data extractor recognizes them and does not emit invalid data.\n\nAs for how to verify if the data extraction code is still valid.. yeah thats the harder bit. Some websites can change their layout/HTML structure.. sometimes they may implement a region block so you have to exclude certain countries etc. Typically my code needs to check whether certain elements get found or not, and I often include a few extra for sanity reasons (not actual data that I want to grab). Usually this works quite well.",

Outliers = potential issues\n- Null/empty field rates - if 30% of your author fields are blank, your selector probably broke mid-run\n\nFor ongoing scrapes:\n\n- Diff monitoring - track when site structure changes (new class names, missing elements)\n- Sentinel pages - scrape a few known URLs with expected outputs, alert if they drift\n\nThe hardest part isn't catching errors - it's catching \"silent\" failures where the scraper returns plausible-looking garbage. That's where sampling + statistical checks help more than schema validation alone.\n\nHope this helps!",

Open a ticket explaining your use case and they'll whitelist the activity. Starts at $5/mo.\n\n2. **Smaller dedicated server providers with human support** (IOFlood, etc.) — unlike Hetzner's automated systems, you can actually talk to someone and explain your use case. ~$60-130/mo for a dedicated box.\n\n3. **Proxy provider with large IP pool** — at your scale you need tens of thousands of rotating IPs anyway. This offloads abuse complaints to infrastructure built for it.\n\nHope this helps.",

I don't have much coding experience besides data languages but figured I could code this via AI. Looking for how possible and easy this could be or any tips that you experts have.\n\nThe bot would need to essentially monitor and refresh the site, then as cancellations occur or new times open up, the bot would send some sort of custom webhook to alert me of the time/day available with a link to book. I would probably have it poll every 2-3 minutes and use proxies to avoid IP ban. I was checking around github and other sites to see if something has been made already since this is a very commonly used reservation host. Thanks for all the help in advance and I could provide more information if needed.   \n  \nEDIT: The main error I'm running into is that the bot sends a webhook every time it checks rather than filtering to only when its available, then populating the webhook with info.",

No headless browser or JS rendering needed.\n\nSince you're already using n8n, here's what I'd do:\n\n1. **HTTP Request node** — simple GET to the waitwhile URL\n2. **HTML Extract node** — pull the JSON from the `<script id=\"__NEXT_DATA__\">` tag\n3. **Check the field** `props.ssrLocationData.availableBookingResourceIds` — when this array is not empty, slots are open\n4. **IF node** — compare to the previous result (store it with a Set node or a file). Only continue if it changed from empty to non-empty\n5. **Discord webhook node** — fires only when new slots appear\n\nThat solves your \"webhook on every refresh\" problem — you're only alerting on state changes, not on every poll.\n\nI tested it just now with a plain GET request — the data comes back without needing proxies or anything special.",

Rather than just editing DOM via JS in console the agent is treating the page, and the DOM as a **file**.\n\nThe models are often trained in RL sandboxes with full access to the filesystem and bash, so they are really good at using it. So to make the agent behave well, I've simulated this environment.\n\nThe whole state of a page and scripts is implemented as a virtual filesystem hacked on top of `browser.local` storage. URL is mapped to directories, and the agent starts inside this directory. It has the tools to read/edit files, grep around and a fake bash command that is just used for running scripts and executing JS code.\n\nI've tested only with Opus 4.5 so far, and it works pretty reliably.  \nThe state of the file system can be synced to FS, although because Firefox doesn't support Filesystem API, you need to manually import the FS contents first.\n\nThis agent is \\*really\\* useful for extracting things to CSV.",

Even with tls-client doing everything \"right,\" there's a ton of signals beyond cipher suites:\n\n* **JA4 fingerprint** (JA3 is basically dead now since browsers randomize TLS extensions) - check yours vs real Chrome at [tls.peet.ws/api/all](http://tls.peet.ws/api/all)\n* **HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame** \\- the order and default values matter more than you'd think\n* **ClientHello extension order** \\- not just having the right extensions, but the sequence\n\nWhat protection are you hitting? Akamai, Cloudflare, something else? That'll help narrow down what's catching you.\n\nPS: Worst comes to worst, Wireshark, intercept the request from a real browser vs your setup, and see what the difference is. I had a site once that I spent weeks on, and Wireshark showed me the order of headers. One more thing, only using Rust i was able to recreate the same order. \n\nGood luck",
