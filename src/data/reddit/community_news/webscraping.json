      "text": "Standard Selenium WebDriver implementations often face significant limitations in production environments, primarily due to blocking I/O execution patterns which increase overhead when scaling via threading. Furthermore, the lack of native, typed interfaces for Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) domains complicates low-level browser control. Additionally, standard automation signatures are easily identified by advanced anti-bot solutions through browser fingerprint analysis.\n\nTo address these issues, I have developed **osn-selenium**, an asynchronous automation framework built on top of Selenium. Specifically architected for Blink-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Yandex), it utilizes the Trio library to provide structured concurrency. The framework employs a modular Mixin-based architecture that maintains 99% backward compatibility with standard Selenium calls while exposing advanced control interfaces.\n\n**Core Technical Features:**\n\n* **Structured Concurrency (Trio):** Native integration with the Trio event loop via TrioThreadMixin, enabling efficient concurrent management of multiple browser instances.\n* **Typed CDP Executors:** High-level, typed access to all Chrome DevTools Protocol domains. This allows for real-time network request interception and response manipulation directly from Python.\n* **Advanced Fingerprint Spoofing Engine:** Features a built-in registry of over 200 parameters (Canvas, WebGL, AudioContext, etc.). Detection can be enabled in two lines of code. Supports spoofing via static/random values, static/random noise injection, and dynamic modification of value sequences. Additionally, the registry of parameters can be expanded.\n* **Dedicated dev\\_tools Package:** A module designed for background browser event processing. It features specialized loggers for CDP and fingerprinting activity, alongside advanced request interception handlers.\n* **Full Instance Wrappers:** Custom high-level wrappers for all Selenium objects including WebElements, Alerts, ShadowRoots, etc. These are 100% drop-in compatible with vanilla Selenium logic.\n* **Human-Like Interaction Layer:** Implementation of natural mouse movements using Bezier curves with jitter, smooth scrolling algorithms, and human-like typing simulation.\n\nI am currently expanding the framework's capabilities. Short-term goals include automated parameter aggregation for all flags managers, implementing higher-level logic for Network, Page, and Runtime domains in the dev\\_tools package, refining Human-Like movement patterns, and supporting a hybrid driver interface (both mixins and component-attributes). Support for additional Chromium-based browsers is also underway.\n\nThe long-term roadmap includes support for Gecko-based browsers (Firefox) and developing true internal concurrency for single browser instances using Trio memory channels and direct CDP pipe management. I am looking for technical feedback and contributors to help refine the architecture.\n\nIf you are interested in modernizing your Selenium-based infrastructure, I invite you to explore the [repository](https://github.com/oddshellnick/osn-selenium) and contribute to its development.",

          "text": "Hey!\n\nYou've basically hit the wall where HTTP-level scraping stops being practical. Akamai Bot Manager with sensor.js is specifically designed to detect the difference between real browsers and automation.\n\nTo answer your conceptual question directly:\n\n1. **Reproducing sensor payloads manually** - theoretically possible but a nightmare to maintain. The fingerprint includes WebGL rendering, canvas, audio context, and dozens of other signals that change with Akamai updates\n\n2. **Full browser with real interaction** - this works but you need the browser to actually execute the JS and pass the challenges. The cookie harvesting approach others mentioned is the right idea\n\n3. **Alternative data sources** - for flight data specifically, Google Flights pulls from the same GDS systems. Some airlines also have affiliate/partner APIs that are less protected\n\nThe practical boundary: if a site invests in Akamai Bot Manager, they've decided to make scraping hard. You either invest equally in bypassing it (real browsers, residential IPs, proper session handling) or find a different data source.\n\nFor personal research at low volume, a real browser with residential IP and human-like delays might work. But it'll be fragile.\n\nGood luck!",

          "text": "Hey!\n\nAkamai's detection goes way beyond headers - it fingerprints TLS settings (JA3/JA4), HTTP/2 frame ordering, and behavioral signals from their sensor script.\n\nFor pure HTTP without a browser, you'd need to:\n\n- Match TLS fingerprint exactly (curl-impersonate can help here)\n- Replicate HTTP/2 frame ordering and priority settings\n- Handle their cookie validation flow (initial request → sensor challenge → validated session)\n- Rotate IPs before behavioral patterns get flagged\n\nThe substack article someone linked is a good starting point for headers. But honestly, if the site is running Akamai Bot Manager (not just basic Akamai CDN), pure HTTP scraping becomes a cat-and-mouse game. Their sensor.js collects browser fingerprints that are hard to fake without actual JS execution.\n\nYou might want to check if the site has a mobile app or public API - sometimes those have lighter protections than the web frontend.\n\nGood luck!",

So to make the agent behave well, I've simulated this environment.\n\nThe whole state of a page and scripts is implemented as a virtual filesystem hacked on top of `browser.local` storage. URL is mapped to directories, and the agent starts inside this directory. It has the tools to read/edit files, grep around and a fake bash command that is just used for running scripts and executing JS code.\n\nI've tested only with Opus 4.5 so far, and it works pretty reliably.  \nThe state of the file system can be synced to FS, although because Firefox doesn't support Filesystem API, you need to manually import the FS contents first.\n\nThis agent is \\*really\\* useful for extracting things to CSV.",
