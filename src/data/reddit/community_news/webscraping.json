      "text": "Last couple months I was automating browser tasks on sites behind Cloudflare and reCAPTCHA. Tried various tools and solutions out there, everything either broke on the next Chrome update, got detected, or died. I was duct-taping 4 tools together and something broke every other week.\n\nSo I patched Chromium itself at the C++ source level.\n\nCloakBrowser is a small Python wrapper around a custom Chromium binary with 16 fingerprint patches compiled into the source. Not JavaScript injection, not config flags, canvas, WebGL, audio, fonts, GPU strings, all modified before compilation.\n\nResults:\n\n\\- reCAPTCHA v3: 0.9 (server-verified)  \n\\- Cloudflare Turnstile: pass (managed + non-interactive)  \n\\- BrowserScan, FingerprintJS, deviceandbrowserinfo: all clean  \n\\- 14/14 detection tests passed (full results on GitHub)\n\n    pip install cloakbrowser \n    \n    from cloakbrowser import launch \n    browser = launch() \n    page = browser.new_page()\n\nSame Playwright API, binary auto-downloads on first run (\\~200MB, cached).\n\nHow it's different from Patchright/rebrowser: those patch the protocol layer. We patch the browser itself, fingerprint values baked in at compile time. TLS matches because it IS Chrome.\n\nWhat it does NOT do: no proxy rotation, no CAPTCHA solving, no fingerprint randomization per session (yet). It's a browser, not a scraping stack. Bring your own proxies.  \nWe don't bypass reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA just thinks we're a normal browser — because we are one.\n\nLinux x64 right now (even inside docker)  \nmacOS coming soon (let me know if you need it, helps me prioritize).\n\n[https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser](https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser)  \n[https://cloakbrowser.dev/](https://cloakbrowser.dev/)  \nPyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/cloakbrowser/](https://pypi.org/project/cloakbrowser/) (`pip install cloakbrowser)`  \nnpm: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloakbrowser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloakbrowser) (`npm install cloakbrowser)`\n\nIf you have a site that blocks everything, throw it at CloakBrowser and let me know. I like the challenge. Hardest cases welcome.  \nPro tip: pair it with a residential proxy, the browser handles fingerprints, but your IP still matters.\n\nEarly days — feedback, bugs, requests are welcome.\n\n**Update 1:**\n\nJust shipped it! npm install cloakbrowser — supports both Playwright and Puppeteer\n\nSame stealth binary, same 14/14 detection results. TypeScript with full types.\n\n     // Playwright (default)\n      import { launch } from 'cloakbrowser';\n      const browser = await launch();\n      const page = await browser.newPage();\n      await page.goto('https://example.com');\n    \n      // Or with Puppeteer\n      import { launch } from 'cloakbrowser/puppeteer';\n\n**Update 2**:\n\nOur GitHub organization was temporarily flagged by an automated system.  \nWe were reorganizing repositories today, and the bulk activity on a new org, combined with a large binary on Releases and a traffic spike from this post — triggered GitHub's automated moderation.  \nWe've filed an appeal and expect it to be restored soon (at least hoping so).\n\nIn the meantime:  \n\\- `pip install cloakbrowser` and `npm install cloakbrowser` still work — binary downloads from our mirror  \n\\- GitLab Mirror - [https://gitlab.com/CloakHQ/cloakbrowser](https://gitlab.com/CloakHQ/cloakbrowser)  \n\\- And simple site - [https://cloakbrowser.dev/](https://cloakbrowser.dev/)  \n\\- GitHub repo is temporarily 404, should be back soon.  \n\\- [Posted about the situation in r/github](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/1reu95z/github_flagged_our_opensource_new_born_org_with/)\n\nNothing changed with the project itself. Sorry for the inconvenience.\n\n**Update 3:**  \nGitHub org is restored — back to normal.   \nThanks everyone who reached out and helped during the downtime.",

And a slightly older Chromium with correct TLS + consistent fingerprints still beats any JS injection tool on a current version.\n\nAuto-update in the wrapper is on the roadmap too — check for new binary on launch, download in background.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI do a fair bit of data collection for my own side projects. Usually, I just write a quick Python script with BeautifulSoup, but sometimes I just want to visit a webpage, click on a few elements, and download a CSV without having to open my terminal or fight with CORS.\n\nI tried a few of the existing visual scraping tools out there, but almost all of them lock you into expensive monthly subscriptions. I really hate the idea of paying a recurring fee just to extract public text, and I don't love my data passing through a random third-party server.\n\nSo I spent the last few weeks building my own alternative. It’s a completely free, open-source no code web scraper that runs entirely locally in your browser.\n\nHere is how the workflow looks right now:\n\n* You open the extension on the page you want to scrape.\n* You click on the elements you want to grab (it auto-detects repeating patterns like lists, grids, or tables).\n* You name your columns (e.g., \"Price\", \"Product Title\").\n* Hit export, and it generates a clean CSV or JSON file instantly.\n\nBecause it runs locally in your browser, it uses your own IP and session state. This means it doesn't get instantly blocked by standard anti-bot protections the way server-side scrapers do.\n\nSince it's open source, you don't have to worry about sudden paywalls, API caps, or vendor lock-in.\n\nYou can install it directly from the Chrome Web Store here:[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/no-code-web-scraper/cogbfdcdnohnoknnogniplimgkdoohea](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/no-code-web-scraper/cogbfdcdnohnoknnogniplimgkdoohea)\n\n(The GitHub repo with all the source code is linked on the store page, but let me know if you want me to drop it in the comments).\n\nI'm still actively working on it, so please let me know if you run into bugs. It struggles a bit with deeply nested shadow DOMs right now, but I'm trying to figure out a fix for the next update. Honest feedback or feature ideas are super welcome!",

          "text": "Hi,\n\nSince it works manually but triggers on automation, your issue is likely browser fingerprinting rather than the CAPTCHA itself. reCAPTCHA Enterprise v3 scores silently in the background — by the time you see the challenge, you've already failed the score check.\n\nA few things to look at:\n\n- **Session warming**: Log in and browse the site normally before the critical click. v3 scores your entire session, not just the final action\n- **Fingerprint consistency**: Make sure your timezone, WebGL, canvas, and navigator properties match a real browser profile. Tools like patchright help but aren't perfect out of the box\n- **Cookie persistence**: Reuse cookies from a manual session where you passed. If you already have a good score tied to that session, the final click won't trigger a challenge\n\nThe 1-second window is realistic if the scoring already happened upstream and you're clean going in.\n\nI hope this helps",

          "text": "Hey! I’m not sure what category I fall into when it comes to scraping, but I’ve done plenty of scraping projects over the years and have gained solid knowledge of how to scrape various websites.\n\nHere are some tips from my side:\n\n1. Try to avoid using browsers for scraping unless it’s absolutely necessary. Even if you have to use one, capture the request headers from the browser and try to mimic the request using those headers instead.\n2. Use residential rotating proxies for recurring scraping tasks, especially when you need to scrape a site on a daily basis.\n3. Consider integrating AI into your HTML parsing. This can save you a lot of maintenance work in the long run. Just make sure to enforce structured output.\n4. Write modular code instead of putting everything into one or two scripts. This will save you time on future projects and make maintenance easier.\n5. Use exponential backoff instead of simple retries. Even better, use exponential backoff with jitter. This helps reduce bottlenecks and handle rate limiting more effectively.\n\nIf you already have strong scraping knowledge, consider building APIs for popular websites and selling them on RapidAPI.\n\nThese are the points that come to mind right now. I’ll add more in a reply if I think of anything else.\n\nPeace ✌️",

Since you're new to scraping, I'd suggest using an LLM (like ChatGPT or Claude) to help you build the whole setup step by step.\n\nThe approach:\n1. **Google Maps API** — search for pubs/bars/restaurants by location. Free tier covers small-scale searches. Ask the LLM to write you a Python script that pulls business names, addresses, phone numbers, and website URLs.\n2. **Website scraping** — have the LLM generate a second script that visits each business website and extracts email addresses from contact pages, mailto: links, etc.\n\nYou don't need to know how to code — just describe what you want to the LLM and it'll generate working scripts you can run. It can also help you set up Python on your machine if you haven't already.\n\nSkip the Chrome extensions — they're limited and unreliable. A simple script gives you full control and costs nothing.\n\nI hope this helps.",

Way less headache than managing your own pool.\n\nBrowser automation (Playwright/Puppeteer) with stealth plugins helps a ton with CAPTCHAs. Some sites still require manual solving services, but between that and residential IPs, most blocks disappear.\n\nWhat scale are you running at? And what types of sites mainly?

It works locally because your home ISP looks like a normal user, then you deploy to AWS/GCP and you’re suddenly coming from a known datacenter range, so some sites will challenge or block you almost immediately. Tweaking headers and adding delays can help once you get past IP reputation, but it won’t rescue a cloud IP that’s already scored as “hosting.” In my experience, if you get blocked in the first few requests it’s mostly the IP range, and if it runs for a while then starts throwing 403/429/CAPTCHA pages it’s more rate limits or bot detection (sessions, fingerprints, headless). Most production setups either keep compute in AWS and route outbound traffic through residential/ISP/mobile proxies (and keep the same IP for a short session instead of rotating every request), or they run the scraper from residential/ISP egress and just ship results back to the cloud. Datacenter IPs are still fine for easy targets, but once a site is running Cloudflare or one of the big bot vendors you usually need higher-trust IPs and often a real browser. If you can paste one example response (status code plus a couple headers, redact cookies), it’s usually pretty obvious what kind of block you’re hitting.",

Has anyone had success finding internal APIs on heavily Cloudflare-protected sites? Any tips on what to look for in the Network tab?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n",

A few things that matter:\n\n- **Residential proxies** are practically required — datacenter IPs get flagged instantly\n- **Browser fingerprinting** is the real challenge. They check TLS fingerprint, canvas, WebGL, and navigator properties. Tools like undetected-chromedriver or Playwright with stealth plugins help, but you need to keep them updated\n- **Rate limiting** — slow down your requests significantly. DataDome tracks request patterns, so randomized delays between 5-15s per page help\n- **Cookie/session management** — solve the initial challenge once, then reuse the session cookies for subsequent requests\n\nThe people who succeed consistently use a combination of residential rotation + proper browser emulation rather than just throwing proxies at it.\n\nI hope this helps.",

Your best bet would be to use a paid service if you want to make more than 1 request every few seconds. I use a premium service at scale for a pretty steep price and it still struggles. \nIf you still want the challenge or it's a small scale, residential proxies are pretty much mandatory. Using a headful browser also helps if you're able, but you'll be detected if you don't rotate fingerprints. \nEDIT: Alternatively, if this is for Spain only you could target Yaencontre. After they got acquired by Idealista, it got a lot of the Idealista content with more lax protections.",
