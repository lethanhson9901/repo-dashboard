I'm a student and I dont have money to spend.\n\nIs there a way I can deploy a headless browser for free? what i mean to ask is, having the convenience to hit an endpoint, and for it to run the scraper and show me results. Its just for personal use. Any services that offer this- or have a generous free tier?\n\nI can learn/am willing to learn stacks, am familiar with most web driver runners selenium/scrapy/playwright/cypress/puppeteer.\n\nThanks for reading \n\nEdit: tasks that I require are very minimal, 2-3 requests per day, with a few button clicks ",

Make the file your url list. Make the upload trigger a script that launches a small fargate instance that shuts down when it’s done. 0.25 vcpu and 256m of ram.

There's ways to make this setup more metadata-driven too, as you can parameterize Azure Pipelines and use the Azure DevOps API to trigger runs, and you can easily tack on Azure Logic Apps (4000 free actions per month) as a simple orchestrator, use any kind of blob or table storage (even Google Drive) to store and fetch your metadata table containing the schedules and info about which scripts to run.

This raises a few fundamental questions for me.\n\nAt an intuitive level, it seems possible to:\n\n* add randomness (scrolling, delays, mouse movement),\n* simulate exploration instead of direct actions,\n* or hide client-side activity,\n\nand therefore make an automated actor look human.\n\nBut in practice, this approach seems to break down very quickly.\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand is **why**, and whether people actually solve this problem differently today.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. **Why doesn’t adding randomness make automation behave like a real human?** What parts of human behavior (intent, context, timing, correlation) are hard to reproduce even if actions look human on the surface?\n2. **What do modern platforms analyze beyond basic signals like IP, cookies, or user-agent?** At a conceptual level, what kinds of behavioral patterns make automation detectable?\n3. **Why isn’t hiding or masking client-side actions enough?** Even if visual interactions are hidden, what timing or state-level signals still reveal automation?\n4. **Is this problem mainly technical, or statistical and economic?** Is human-like automation theoretically possible but impractical at scale, or effectively impossible in real-world conditions?\n5. **From an OSINT perspective, how is platform data actually collected today?**\n   * Do people still use automation in any form?\n   * Do they rely more on aggregated or secondary data sources?\n   * Or is the work mostly manual and selective?\n6. **Are these systems truly being “bypassed,” or are people simply avoiding platforms and using different data paths altogether?**\n\nI’m not looking for instructions on bypassing protections.  \nI want to understand **how behavioral detection works at a high level**, what it can and cannot infer, and what **realistic, sustainable approaches** exist if the goal is insight rather than evasion.\n\n**Note:**  \nSorry in advance — I used AI assistance to help write this question.

Your field is incredibly challenging. \n\nThe reason I said bot detection is easy after the fact, is that you then have the time needed to analyze behavioral traits and complex data, and for the relevant data to exist in the first place. \n\nOnce the data exists, it’s easy to spot if you want a quarterly summary of “who was a bot”. But this is different than blocking bots in real time. \n\nLet’s say I load Facebook, login, and start looking for group names with the goal of finding all relevant groups related to {keyword_list}. \n\nLoading Facebook is normal, logging in is normal, triggering the autocomplete is normal. \n\nWhat is abnormal, is that every time I login, I go immediately to the groups tab and trigger this autocomplete. Or that I spend X time on the groups page, vs Y on the feed. Or one of many non behavioral indicators (mismatch between events firing and device type, etc)\n\nThat takes time to develop, and resources to summarize individually. It takes even more resources to summarize what “normal” is.\n\nThere are not many places that can do this in realtime, for every page load, before sending response headers, or before the bots have already done significant work.",

      "text": "Hello, dear community!\n\nI’ve got an issue being detected by DataDome (403 status) while scraping a big resource.\n\n\n\n**What works**\n\nI use Zendriver pointing to my local MacOS Chrome. Navigating to site’s main page -> waiting for the DataDome endpoint that returns DataDome token -> making subsequent requests via curl\\_cffi (on my local MacOS machine) with that token being sent as a DataDome cookie.  \nI’ve checked that this token lives quite long - is valid for at least several hours, but assume even more (managed to make requests after multiple days).\n\n\n\n**What I want to do that doesn’t work**\n\nI want to deploy it and opted for Docker. Installed Chrome (not Chromium) within the Docker. Tried the same algorithm as above. The outcome is that I’m able to get token from the DataDome endpoint. But subsequent curl\\_cffi requests fail with 403. Tried curl\\_cffi requests from Docker and locally - both fail, issued token is not valid.\n\nNext thing I’ve enabled xvfb that resulted in a bit better outcome. Namely, after obtaining the token the next request via curl\\_cffi succeeds, while subsequent ones fail with 403. So, it’s basically single use.\n\nNext I’ve played with different user agents, set timezone, but the outcome is the same.\n\n\n\nOne more observation - there’s another request which exposes DataDome token via Set-Cookie response header. If done with Zendriver under Docker, Set-Cookie header for that same endpoint is missing.\n\nSo, my assumption is that my trust score by DataDome is higher than to show me captcha, but lower than to issue a long-living token.\n\n\n\nAnd one more observation - both locally and under Docker requests via curl\\_cffi work with 131st Chrome version being impersonated. Though, 143rd latest Chrome version is used to obtain this token. Any other curl\\_cffi impersonation options just don’t work (result in 403). Why does that happen?\n\nAnd I see that curl\\_cffi supports impersonation of the following OSes only: Win10, MacOS (different versions), iOS. So, in theory it shouldn’t work at all combined with Docker setup?\n\n\n\n**Question** \\- could you please point me in the right direction what to investigate and try next. How do you solve such deployment problems and reliably deploy scraping solutions? And probably you can share advice how to enhance my DataDome bypassing strategy?\n\n\n\nThank you for any input and advices!",

          "text": "DataDome tokens are usually bound to more than just a cookie. They often get tied to the full client “shape” (TLS and HTTP2 fingerprint, IP reputation, timing, browser signals, sometimes even local storage) so a token minted in one environment can be useless in another. That explains why local Mac works but Docker fails, and why you see “single use” behavior.\n\nWhat to investigate, at a high level:\n\n* Fingerprint consistency: the environment that mints the token needs to match the environment that reuses it. If you mint in a real Chrome and replay with curl, any mismatch in TLS or HTTP2 can invalidate quickly.\n* IP consistency: tokens can be scoped to IP or ASN. Local IP vs Docker egress often differs even on the same machine if you run through different routes.\n* Header and cookie jar completeness: missing Set-Cookie under Docker usually means the JS flow or redirects differ, or a required request wasn’t executed the same way.\n* Version coupling: the fact that only one curl\\_cffi impersonation works suggests the backend is keying on a very specific TLS stack and ordering.\n\nFor deployment, the reliable pattern is usually to keep the whole flow in one place. Either keep requests inside the same browser context that earned the session, or run the replay client with a fingerprint that is as close as possible to that browser and network path. Mixing “real browser to get token” with a very different HTTP client is where these systems tend to break.\n\nIf this is for a legitimate use case, the sustainable option is getting approved access or using an official feed. Trying to “enhance bypass” is a cat and mouse game and will keep changing.",

Because I've tried to obtain DataDome cookie token both with & without proxies (running locally without Docker). And then use via curl\\_cffi for subsequent requests.

Also, I make sure to use the correct cookie data and headers to mimic the browser I used as closely as possible.\n\nI use this method for high-frequency scraping.

The second thing is to use pydoll python, go to the website, make 100 or 200 requests using its inbuilt request maker that copies everything from the browser that is already opened, then do some random actions, send 200 to 400 requests again and this way, you can scale up. You can also integrate different residential proxies for doing this in scale. This is far better than copying the token and sending it. The website might be blocking you via some other way other than TLS fingerprinting, if you use pydoll, it will mimic everything from the actual session you're using and requests will never be rejected most probably.

      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI’ve been benefiting from the open-source projects here for a while, so I wanted to give back. I’m a big fan of compiled languages, and I needed a way to handle browser tasks (specifically CAPTCHAs) in Rust without getting flagged.\n\nI forked chromiumoxide and ported the stealth patches from `rebrowser` and `puppeteer-real-browser`. I also built dedicated solvers for Cloudflare and GeeTest.\n\n🧪 The Proof (Detection Results)\n\nI’ve tested this against common scanners and it’s passing:\n\n* **Intoli / WebDriver Advanced:** Passed (WebDriver hidden, Permissions default).\n* **Fingerprint Scanner:** `PHANTOM_UA`, `PHANTOM_PROPERTIES`, and `SELENIUM_DRIVER` all return **OK**.\n* **Canvas/WebGL:** Properly spoofing Google Inc. (NVIDIA) with no broken dimensions.\n* **Stack Traces:** `PHANTOM_OVERFLOW` depth and error names match real Chrome behavior.\n\n🛠 The Repos\n\n* [**chaser-oxide**](https://github.com/ccheshirecat/chaser-oxide)– Chromiumoxide fork with stealth/impersonation patches.\n* [**chaser-cf**](https://github.com/ccheshirecat/chaser-cf)– Rust implementation for Cloudflare Turnstile.\n* [**chaser-gt**](https://github.com/ccheshirecat/chaser-gt)– GeeTest solver using deobfuscation (via `rquests`/`curl_cffi`).\n\n**Note:** I shipped these with **C FFI bindings**, so you can use them in **Python, Go, or Node** if you just want the Rust performance/stealth without writing Rust code. I personally prefer this over managing a separate microservice.\n\n💬 Curious about your workflows:\n\n1. **Third-party APIs:** For those using paid solvers (Capsolver, etc.), is it for the convenience, or because you don't want to maintain stealth patches yourself?\n2. **Scraping Use Cases:** What are you guys actually building? I’ll go first: I’m overengineering automation for crypto casinos because I found some gaps in their flow lol.\n3. **Differentiators:** What actually makes a solver \"good\" in 2026? Is it raw solve speed, or just the success rate on high-entropy challenges?\n\nIt’s still early, so feel free to contribute, roast my code, or reach out to collaborate. Happy New Year!",

I understand that there are paid APIs and the Steam API that provide real-time metadata and prices, but to be honest, I’d prefer to go with free solutions. This brings me to scrapers, since I haven’t been able to find any free APIs that meet my needs. I’ve dug through GitHub and found some repos, but most of them either don’t work with modern JavaScript heavy sites, or they only scrape limited metadata. The only repo I found that works well is [this one](https://github.com/eovacius/csgodatabase-scraper/), which returns both prices and metadata fairly quickly. However, the project is missing some content, like souvenirs, stickers, cases, etc. It looks like it’s still pretty new, so I’m sure the content will be updated soon, but I don’t want to wait too long. So, I was hoping some of you might know of any resources or public databases/sites that would let me scrape CS2 skin information. Or, if there are any other free methods to get this info without scraping, that would be super helpful too. Thanks in advance!",

Over time, project needs pushed me deeper into web scraping and I ended up genuinely enjoying it.\n\n**A bit of context**\n\nLike most people, I started with browser automation using tools like Playwright and Selenium. Then I moved on to crawlers with Scrapy. Today, my first approach is reverse engineering exposed backend APIs whenever possible.\n\nI have successfully reverse engineered Amazon’s search API, Instagram’s profile API and DuckDuckGo’s `/html` endpoint to extract raw JSON data. This approach is far easier to parse than HTML and significantly more resource efficient compared to full browser automation.\n\nThat said, I’m also realistic. Not every website exposes usable API endpoints. In those cases, I fall back to traditional browser automation or crawler based solutions to meet business requirements.\n\nIf you ever need clean, structured spreadsheets filled with reliable data, I’m confident I can deliver. I charge nothing upfront and only ask for payment once the work is completed and approved.\n\n**How I approach a project**\n\n* You clarify the data you need such as product name, company name, price, email and the target websites.\n* I audit the sites to identify exposed API endpoints. This usually takes around 30 minutes per typical website.\n* If an API is available, I use it. Otherwise, I choose between browser automation or crawlers depending on the site. I then share the scraping strategy, estimated infrastructure costs and total time required.\n* Once agreed, you provide a BRD or I create one myself, which I usually do as a best practice to stay within clear boundaries.\n* I build the scraper, often within the same day for simple to mid sized projects.\n* I scrape a 100 row sample and share it for review.\n* After approval, you provide credentials for your preferred proxy and infrastructure vendors. I can also recommend suitable vendors and plans if needed.\n* I run the full scrape and stop once the agreed volume is reached, for example 5000 products.\n* I hand over the data in CSV, Google Sheets and XLSX formats along with the scripts.\n\nOnce everything is approved, I request the due payment. For one off projects, we part ways professionally. If you like my work, we continue collaborating on future projects.\n\nA clear win for both sides.\n\nIf this sounds useful, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishwas-batra/) or just send me a DM here.",
