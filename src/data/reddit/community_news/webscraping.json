Instead of websockets, it uses file descriptors to connect to the browser using Chrome Dev Protocol.\n\n* Directly connects and controls the browser over CDP, no middleware\n* 100% asynchronous, nothing gets blocked\n* Built completely using built-in Python asyncio \n   * Except one `deprecated` dependency for python-cdp modules\n* Best for running multiple browsers on same machine\n* No risk of zombie chromes if code crashes\n* Easy customization via class inheritance\n* No automation signatures as there is no framework in between\n\nCurrently limited to POSIX based systems only (Linux/Mac).\n\n\n\nBug reports, feature requests and contributions are welcome!\n\n\n\n[https://github.com/sohaib17/pypecdp](https://github.com/sohaib17/pypecdp)",

I have my framework setup so it can either load resources from the live network, from a cache HAR, or a prerecorded HAR file. Any live network data gets also written into a HAR cache with some rules for how long that data can live there (for example, some \"evergreen\" content never gets invalidated, but I may change the data extraction code at a later point, so I can refresh all my data without hitting the site a million times again).\n\nBasically it means I can also write test cases and rerun them as many times as I'd like. For these prerecorded traces, I've some unit tests in place with the expected data the data extractor should return. To this end, you can also specifically record traces of 404 pages etc. and verify your data extractor recognizes them and does not emit invalid data.\n\nAs for how to verify if the data extraction code is still valid.. yeah thats the harder bit. Some websites can change their layout/HTML structure.. sometimes they may implement a region block so you have to exclude certain countries etc. Typically my code needs to check whether certain elements get found or not, and I often include a few extra for sanity reasons (not actual data that I want to grab). Usually this works quite well.",

Outliers = potential issues\n- Null/empty field rates - if 30% of your author fields are blank, your selector probably broke mid-run\n\nFor ongoing scrapes:\n\n- Diff monitoring - track when site structure changes (new class names, missing elements)\n- Sentinel pages - scrape a few known URLs with expected outputs, alert if they drift\n\nThe hardest part isn't catching errors - it's catching \"silent\" failures where the scraper returns plausible-looking garbage. That's where sampling + statistical checks help more than schema validation alone.\n\nHope this helps!",

      "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am new to your community and web scraping in general. I have 6 years of experience in web application development but have never encountered the topic of web scraping. I became interested in this topic when I was planning to implement a pet project for myself to track prices for products that I would like to purchase in the future. That is, the idea was that I would give the application a link to a product from any online store and it, in turn, would constantly extract data from the page and check if the price had changed. I realized that I needed web scraping and I immediately created a simple web scraping on node.js using playwright without a proxy. It coped with simple pages, but if I had already tested serious marketplaces like alibaba, I was immediately blocked. I tried with a proxy but the same thing happened. Then I came across web scraping API (unfortunately I can't remember which service I used) and it worked great! But it is damn expensive. I calculated that if I use web scraping API for my application and the application will scrape each added product every 8 hours for a month, then I will pay $1 per product. That is, if I added 20 products that will be tracked, then I will pay web scraping API +- $20. This is very expensive because I have a couple of dozen different products that I would like to submit (I am a Lego fan, so I have a lot of sets that I want to buy 😄)\n\nAs a result, I thought about writing my own web scraping that would be simpler than all other web scraping APIs but at least cheaper. But I have no idea if it will be cheaper at all.\n\nCan someone with experience tell me if it will be cheaper?\n\nMobile/residential or data center proxies?\n\nI have seen many recommendations for web scraping in python, can I still write in node?\n\nIn which direction should I look?",

You are asking \"I am going to build something will be be better and cheaper than something else\". No one knows.\n\nBut you have a LOT of work todo before you can sell this service. Hitting a site once is one thing, running a service hitting 100s / 1000s of services you have captcha issues, anti bot protections etc etc.\n\nGet your system working first before you try to run and sell something that isn't working :-)\n\ngood luck",

Even if you get blocked 9 times out of 10 (which it should never actually be this bad), you don't need to optimize for volume at that scale, so you can afford to get blocked as long as it succeeds often enough. You should at least try datacenter proxies first to see if they are good enough, since they are much cheaper.  \nIt always depends on the sites protection, but keep in mind that for low volume, your real IP will always have a better reputation than any proxy on the market.",

Looking for how possible and easy this could be or any tips that you experts have.\n\nThe bot would need to essentially monitor and refresh the site, then as cancellations occur or new times open up, the bot would send some sort of custom webhook to alert me of the time/day available with a link to book. I would probably have it poll every 2-3 minutes and use proxies to avoid IP ban. I was checking around github and other sites to see if something has been made already since this is a very commonly used reservation host. Thanks for all the help in advance and I could provide more information if needed.   \n  \nEDIT: The main error I'm running into is that the bot sends a webhook every time it checks rather than filtering to only when its available, then populating the webhook with info.",

Only continue if it changed from empty to non-empty\n5. **Discord webhook node** — fires only when new slots appear\n\nThat solves your \"webhook on every refresh\" problem — you're only alerting on state changes, not on every poll.\n\nI tested it just now with a plain GET request — the data comes back without needing proxies or anything special.",

          "text": "Hi,\n\nTLS fingerprinting is a pain. Even with tls-client doing everything \"right,\" there's a ton of signals beyond cipher suites:\n\n* **JA4 fingerprint** (JA3 is basically dead now since browsers randomize TLS extensions) - check yours vs real Chrome at [tls.peet.ws/api/all](http://tls.peet.ws/api/all)\n* **HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame** \\- the order and default values matter more than you'd think\n* **ClientHello extension order** \\- not just having the right extensions, but the sequence\n\nWhat protection are you hitting? Akamai, Cloudflare, something else? That'll help narrow down what's catching you.\n\nPS: Worst comes to worst, Wireshark, intercept the request from a real browser vs your setup, and see what the difference is. I had a site once that I spent weeks on, and Wireshark showed me the order of headers. One more thing, only using Rust i was able to recreate the same order. \n\nGood luck",
