      "text": "Last couple months I was automating browser tasks on sites behind Cloudflare and reCAPTCHA. Tried various tools and solutions out there, everything either broke on the next Chrome update, got detected, or died. I was duct-taping 4 tools together and something broke every other week.\n\nSo I patched Chromium itself at the C++ source level.\n\nCloakBrowser is a small Python wrapper around a custom Chromium binary with 16 fingerprint patches compiled into the source. Not JavaScript injection, not config flags, canvas, WebGL, audio, fonts, GPU strings, all modified before compilation.\n\nResults:\n\n\\- reCAPTCHA v3: 0.9 (server-verified)  \n\\- Cloudflare Turnstile: pass (managed + non-interactive)  \n\\- BrowserScan, FingerprintJS, deviceandbrowserinfo: all clean  \n\\- 30/30 detection tests passed (full results on GitHub)\n\n    pip install cloakbrowser \n    \n    from cloakbrowser import launch \n    browser = launch() \n    page = browser.new_page()\n\nSame Playwright API, binary auto-downloads on first run (\\~200MB, cached).\n\nHow it's different from Patchright/rebrowser: those patch the protocol layer. We patch the browser itself, fingerprint values baked in at compile time. TLS matches because it IS Chrome.\n\nWhat it does NOT do: no proxy rotation, no CAPTCHA solving, no fingerprint randomization per session (yet). It's a browser, not a scraping stack. Bring your own proxies.  \nWe don't bypass reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA just thinks we're a normal browser — because we are one.\n\nLinux x64 and macOS (Silicon + Intel) are live now, even inside Docker.\n\n[https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser](https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser)  \n[https://cloakbrowser.dev/](https://cloakbrowser.dev/)  \nPyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/cloakbrowser/](https://pypi.org/project/cloakbrowser/) (`pip install cloakbrowser)`  \nnpm: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloakbrowser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloakbrowser) (`npm install cloakbrowser)`\n\nIf you have a site that blocks everything, throw it at CloakBrowser and let me know. I like the challenge. Hardest cases welcome.  \nPro tip: pair it with a residential proxy, the browser handles fingerprints, but your IP still matters.\n\nEarly days — feedback, bugs, requests are welcome.\n\n**Update 1:**\n\nJust shipped it! npm install cloakbrowser — supports both Playwright and Puppeteer\n\nSame stealth binary, same 30/30 detection results. TypeScript with full types.\n\n     // Playwright (default)\n      import { launch } from 'cloakbrowser';\n      const browser = await launch();\n      const page = await browser.newPage();\n      await page.goto('https://example.com');\n    \n      // Or with Puppeteer\n      import { launch } from 'cloakbrowser/puppeteer';\n\n**Update 2**:\n\nOur GitHub organization was temporarily flagged by an automated system.  \nWe were reorganizing repositories today, and the bulk activity on a new org, combined with a large binary on Releases and a traffic spike from this post — triggered GitHub's automated moderation.  \nWe've filed an appeal and expect it to be restored soon (at least hoping so).\n\nIn the meantime:  \n\\- `pip install cloakbrowser` and `npm install cloakbrowser` still work — binary downloads from our mirror  \n\\- GitLab Mirror - [https://gitlab.com/CloakHQ/cloakbrowser](https://gitlab.com/CloakHQ/cloakbrowser)  \n\\- And simple site - [https://cloakbrowser.dev/](https://cloakbrowser.dev/)  \n\\- GitHub repo is temporarily 404, should be back soon.  \n\\- [Posted about the situation in r/github](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/1reu95z/github_flagged_our_opensource_new_born_org_with/)\n\nNothing changed with the project itself. Sorry for the inconvenience.\n\n**Update 3:**  \nGitHub org is restored — back to normal.  \nThanks everyone who reached out and helped during the downtime.\n\n**Update 4:**  \nmacOS builds are live!! Apple Silicon and Intel.  \nIf you tried before and got a download error, that's fixed now.  \nSame `pip install cloakbrowser` /  `npm install cloakbrowser` \\-  binary auto-downloads for your platform.\n\nEarly access, tested on 30 tests, but not yet battle-tested at scale like Linux.  \nIf you hit anything on Mac, open a GitHub issue.",

If you  have a stagnant chrome version this can be a sign that you are using a controlled browser. does the version update with the typical monthly chrome scheduled releases? how does the update cycle work? i read in the code that the first time it downloads the patched binary and then uses that cached version. that would imply it does not update and this was a one time thing. any ideas on how to handle the update cycles?",

And a slightly older Chromium with correct TLS + consistent fingerprints still beats any JS injection tool on a current version.\n\nAuto-update in the wrapper is on the roadmap too — check for new binary on launch, download in background.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI do a fair bit of data collection for my own side projects. Usually, I just write a quick Python script with BeautifulSoup, but sometimes I just want to visit a webpage, click on a few elements, and download a CSV without having to open my terminal or fight with CORS.\n\nI tried a few of the existing visual scraping tools out there, but almost all of them lock you into expensive monthly subscriptions. I really hate the idea of paying a recurring fee just to extract public text, and I don't love my data passing through a random third-party server.\n\nSo I spent the last few weeks building my own alternative. It’s a completely free, open-source no code web scraper that runs entirely locally in your browser.\n\nHere is how the workflow looks right now:\n\n* You open the extension on the page you want to scrape.\n* You click on the elements you want to grab (it auto-detects repeating patterns like lists, grids, or tables).\n* You name your columns (e.g., \"Price\", \"Product Title\").\n* Hit export, and it generates a clean CSV or JSON file instantly.\n\nBecause it runs locally in your browser, it uses your own IP and session state. This means it doesn't get instantly blocked by standard anti-bot protections the way server-side scrapers do.\n\nSince it's open source, you don't have to worry about sudden paywalls, API caps, or vendor lock-in.\n\nYou can install it directly from the Chrome Web Store here:[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/no-code-web-scraper/cogbfdcdnohnoknnogniplimgkdoohea](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/no-code-web-scraper/cogbfdcdnohnoknnogniplimgkdoohea)\n\n(The GitHub repo with all the source code is linked on the store page, but let me know if you want me to drop it in the comments).\n\nI'm still actively working on it, so please let me know if you run into bugs. It struggles a bit with deeply nested shadow DOMs right now, but I'm trying to figure out a fix for the next update. Honest feedback or feature ideas are super welcome!",

My goal is to then reformat/summarize said text/data later in a newsletter format. Is there any tool with a relatively simple GUI (or in which the coding isn't outlandishly difficult to use) and with decent tutorials that people would recommend for this? Given that scraping has been a thing for years, and given the clear time and effort that have been spent developing the tools I've already explored, I'm hoping what I want is already out there, and I'm just not finding the right tutorials/links.

I get the articles from various sources (also following the external links in the body to get more context), rewrite them with AI, resize the featured images, publish them on my own WP sites. Once that's done, phase 2: other scripts start sharing the content on Facebook and other social nets, while another script generates the newsletter from the latest articles, while also adding some affiliate links to it (to books that the readers might be interested in). \n\nMy advice: break this large process into smaller steps, so that it doesn't feel overwhelming, tgen assemble everything into one big pipeline.",

Has anyone had success finding internal APIs on heavily Cloudflare-protected sites? Any tips on what to look for in the Network tab?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n",

I've done this for 15+ years, trust me, knowing how you bang your head against the way for hours days weeks until you solve it is the most useful skill you can have.",

However, it requires a lot of skill and time. The best way to bypass the cloudflare is to firstly understand what it does to detect a bot. It scans a lot of params in your browser, using fingerprints and many other things.\n\nWhen I developed my bot system, I made a MITM proxy chain gate that replaced TLS and HTTP/2 fingerprints with valid ones based on the bot's useragent. Then, you need to spoof a ton of fingerprints: webgl, canvas, fonts, useragent, screen resolution, timezone, locale, even Audio.\n\nAlso, you should understand that a real user never can type the whole sentence in a millisecond or click right in the center of the button. Behavioral patterns are important, too\n\nI can only wish you luck xD",

It works locally because your home ISP looks like a normal user, then you deploy to AWS/GCP and you’re suddenly coming from a known datacenter range, so some sites will challenge or block you almost immediately. Tweaking headers and adding delays can help once you get past IP reputation, but it won’t rescue a cloud IP that’s already scored as “hosting.” In my experience, if you get blocked in the first few requests it’s mostly the IP range, and if it runs for a while then starts throwing 403/429/CAPTCHA pages it’s more rate limits or bot detection (sessions, fingerprints, headless). Most production setups either keep compute in AWS and route outbound traffic through residential/ISP/mobile proxies (and keep the same IP for a short session instead of rotating every request), or they run the scraper from residential/ISP egress and just ship results back to the cloud. Datacenter IPs are still fine for easy targets, but once a site is running Cloudflare or one of the big bot vendors you usually need higher-trust IPs and often a real browser. If you can paste one example response (status code plus a couple headers, redact cookies), it’s usually pretty obvious what kind of block you’re hitting.",

          "text": "Hey! I’m not sure what category I fall into when it comes to scraping, but I’ve done plenty of scraping projects over the years and have gained solid knowledge of how to scrape various websites.\n\nHere are some tips from my side:\n\n1. Try to avoid using browsers for scraping unless it’s absolutely necessary. Even if you have to use one, capture the request headers from the browser and try to mimic the request using those headers instead.\n2. Use residential rotating proxies for recurring scraping tasks, especially when you need to scrape a site on a daily basis.\n3. Consider integrating AI into your HTML parsing. This can save you a lot of maintenance work in the long run. Just make sure to enforce structured output.\n4. Write modular code instead of putting everything into one or two scripts. This will save you time on future projects and make maintenance easier.\n5. Use exponential backoff instead of simple retries. Even better, use exponential backoff with jitter. This helps reduce bottlenecks and handle rate limiting more effectively.\n\nIf you already have strong scraping knowledge, consider building APIs for popular websites and selling them on RapidAPI.\n\nThese are the points that come to mind right now. I’ll add more in a reply if I think of anything else.\n\nPeace ✌️",

I already made a free trial for the website to get the rankings beyond 30 (they only give 30 w/ a free account, and you get the full list on a paid account/trial). But clearly they are able to scrape beyond 100 but all the endpoints I'm trying is limited to 100 results:\n\ne.g. https://itunes.apple.com/se/rss/topfreeapplications/limit=200/genre=36/json \n\n(only gives 100 despite limit set at 200). Apparently this used to return 200 results but they have limited it to 100.\n\nI think there is a new endpoint url to scrape results from because obviously that website is able to get a list beyond 100 result. How are they doing it?\n\nMy goal isn't just to grab the results today, its a daily scrape to see how rankings have changed over time, and ideally i scrape myself vs having to rely on a 3rd party to do it for me that i have to pay for.",

I've had luck using the official App Store Connect API for iOS data it requires a dev account for authentication but can give you deeper country specific charts. For Android, scraping the Play Store directly with something like undetected requests might be your best bet to get past the first page",
