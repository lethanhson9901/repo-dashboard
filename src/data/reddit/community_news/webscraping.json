      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI do a fair bit of data collection for my own side projects. Usually, I just write a quick Python script with BeautifulSoup, but sometimes I just want to visit a webpage, click on a few elements, and download a CSV without having to open my terminal or fight with CORS.\n\nI tried a few of the existing visual scraping tools out there, but almost all of them lock you into expensive monthly subscriptions. I really hate the idea of paying a recurring fee just to extract public text, and I don't love my data passing through a random third-party server.\n\nSo I spent the last few weeks building my own alternative. It’s a completely free, open-source no code web scraper that runs entirely locally in your browser.\n\nHere is how the workflow looks right now:\n\n* You open the extension on the page you want to scrape.\n* You click on the elements you want to grab (it auto-detects repeating patterns like lists, grids, or tables).\n* You name your columns (e.g., \"Price\", \"Product Title\").\n* Hit export, and it generates a clean CSV or JSON file instantly.\n\nBecause it runs locally in your browser, it uses your own IP and session state. This means it doesn't get instantly blocked by standard anti-bot protections the way server-side scrapers do.\n\nSince it's open source, you don't have to worry about sudden paywalls, API caps, or vendor lock-in.\n\nYou can install it directly from the Chrome Web Store here:[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/no-code-web-scraper/cogbfdcdnohnoknnogniplimgkdoohea](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/no-code-web-scraper/cogbfdcdnohnoknnogniplimgkdoohea)\n\n(The GitHub repo with all the source code is linked on the store page, but let me know if you want me to drop it in the comments).\n\nI'm still actively working on it, so please let me know if you run into bugs. It struggles a bit with deeply nested shadow DOMs right now, but I'm trying to figure out a fix for the next update. Honest feedback or feature ideas are super welcome!",

      "text": "Hi all, it seems that most web scraping tools do far more than what I want to do, which is to just scrape the header, main/first image link, tags, and text, of specific articles from various websites, and then put that data in a database of some sort that's usable by Wordpress (or even just into a .csv file at minimum). My goal is to then reformat/summarize said text/data later in a newsletter format. Is there any tool with a relatively simple GUI (or in which the coding isn't outlandishly difficult to use) and with decent tutorials that people would recommend for this? Given that scraping has been a thing for years, and given the clear time and effort that have been spent developing the tools I've already explored, I'm hoping what I want is already out there, and I'm just not finding the right tutorials/links. Thanks in advance for any guidance.",

I get the articles from various sources (also following the external links in the body to get more context), rewrite them with AI, resize the featured images, publish them on my own WP sites. Once that's done, phase 2: other scripts start sharing the content on Facebook and other social nets, while another script generates the newsletter from the latest articles, while also adding some affiliate links to it (to books that the readers might be interested in). \n\nMy advice: break this large process into smaller steps, so that it doesn't feel overwhelming, tgen assemble everything into one big pipeline.",

      "text": "Hey r/webscraping,\n\nI've been researching web scraping with Cloudflare protection for a while now and I'm at a crossroads. I've done a lot of reading (Stack Overflow threads, GitHub issues, etc.) and I understand the landscape pretty well at this point – but I can't decide which approach to actually invest my time in.\n\n# What I've already learned / tried conceptually:\n\n* `undetected_chromedriver` works against basic Cloudflare **but not in headless mode**\n* The workaround for headless on Linux is **Xvfb** (virtual display) with SeleniumBase UC Mode\n* `playwright-stealth`, manually copying cookies/headers, FlareSolverr – all **unreliable** against aggressive Cloudflare configs\n* Copying `cf_clearance` cookies into Scrapy requests **doesn't work** because Cloudflare binds them to the original TLS fingerprint (JA3)\n* For serious Cloudflare (Enterprise tier) basically nothing open-source works reliably\n\n# My actual question:\n\nI've heard that many sites using Cloudflare on their frontend actually have **internal APIs** (XHR/Fetch calls) that are either less protected or protected differently (e.g. just an API key).\n\nShould I:\n\n**Option A)** Focus on bypassing Cloudflare using SeleniumBase UC Mode + Xvfb, accepting that it might break at any time and requires a non-headless setup\n\n**Option B)** Dig into the Network tab of the target site, find the internal API calls, and try to replicate those directly with Python requests – potentially avoiding Cloudflare entirely\n\n**Option C)** Something else entirely that I'm missing?\n\n# My constraints:\n\n* Running on Linux server (so headless environment)\n* Python preferred\n* Want something reasonably stable, not something that breaks every 2 weeks when Cloudflare updates\n\nWhat would you do in my position? Has anyone had success finding internal APIs on heavily Cloudflare-protected sites? Any tips on what to look for in the Network tab?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n",

However, it requires a lot of skill and time. The best way to bypass the cloudflare is to firstly understand what it does to detect a bot. It scans a lot of params in your browser, using fingerprints and many other things.\n\nWhen I developed my bot system, I made a MITM proxy chain gate that replaced TLS and HTTP/2 fingerprints with valid ones based on the bot's useragent. Then, you need to spoof a ton of fingerprints: webgl, canvas, fonts, useragent, screen resolution, timezone, locale, even Audio.\n\nAlso, you should understand that a real user never can type the whole sentence in a millisecond or click right in the center of the button. Behavioral patterns are important, too\n\nI can only wish you luck xD",

Datacenter IPs get flagged almost immediately on most major sites.\n\nFor rotation, I've had good results with backconnect proxy services that handle the rotation on their end — you just hit one endpoint and they cycle IPs automatically. Way less headache than managing your own pool.\n\nBrowser automation (Playwright/Puppeteer) with stealth plugins helps a ton with CAPTCHAs. Some sites still require manual solving services, but between that and residential IPs, most blocks disappear.\n\nWhat scale are you running at? And what types of sites mainly? The approach shifts a lot depending on whether you're hitting a few targets hard vs. scraping broadly across many domains.",

          "text": "Hey! I’m not sure what category I fall into when it comes to scraping, but I’ve done plenty of scraping projects over the years and have gained solid knowledge of how to scrape various websites.\n\nHere are some tips from my side:\n\n1. Try to avoid using browsers for scraping unless it’s absolutely necessary. Even if you have to use one, capture the request headers from the browser and try to mimic the request using those headers instead.\n2. Use residential rotating proxies for recurring scraping tasks, especially when you need to scrape a site on a daily basis.\n3. Consider integrating AI into your HTML parsing. This can save you a lot of maintenance work in the long run. Just make sure to enforce structured output.\n4. Write modular code instead of putting everything into one or two scripts. This will save you time on future projects and make maintenance easier.\n5. Use exponential backoff instead of simple retries. Even better, use exponential backoff with jitter. This helps reduce bottlenecks and handle rate limiting more effectively.\n\nIf you already have strong scraping knowledge, consider building APIs for popular websites and selling them on RapidAPI.\n\nThese are the points that come to mind right now. I’ll add more in a reply if I think of anything else.\n\nPeace ✌️",

The frontend updates the DOM from it but doesn't write back to myx, weird choice on Myntra's end for sure.\n\nSo you should intercept that network response instead of reading myx by listening to responses matching \\`/gateway/v4/search/\\` and read .products from the JSON body.",

I already made a free trial for the website to get the rankings beyond 30 (they only give 30 w/ a free account, and you get the full list on a paid account/trial). But clearly they are able to scrape beyond 100 but all the endpoints I'm trying is limited to 100 results:\n\ne.g. https://itunes.apple.com/se/rss/topfreeapplications/limit=200/genre=36/json \n\n(only gives 100 despite limit set at 200). Apparently this used to return 200 results but they have limited it to 100.\n\nI think there is a new endpoint url to scrape results from because obviously that website is able to get a list beyond 100 result. How are they doing it?\n\nMy goal isn't just to grab the results today, its a daily scrape to see how rankings have changed over time, and ideally i scrape myself vs having to rely on a 3rd party to do it for me that i have to pay for.",

I've had luck using the official App Store Connect API for iOS data it requires a dev account for authentication but can give you deeper country specific charts. For Android, scraping the Play Store directly with something like undetected requests might be your best bet to get past the first page",
