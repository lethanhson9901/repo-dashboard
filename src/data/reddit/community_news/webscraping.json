Anyone can utilize google sheets (or any google app with gapps scripting or similar), to fetch/scrape and pull into your sheets, from there you can do anything with your CSV/sheet from there.\n\nMy example was a spreadsheet I made to track houses during house hunting. Before I turned it into a cool proof of concept web app(that doesnt use Zillow)\n\nGod speed!",

It is an end to end development pipeline that can run autonomously. It also has stateful memory, an in app IDE, live internet access, an in app internet browser, a pseudo self improvement loop, and more.\n\nThis is completely open source and free to use.\n\nIf you use this, please credit the original project. I’m open sourcing it to try to get attention and hopefully a job in the software development industry.\n\nTarget audience: Software developers\n\nComparison: It’s like replit if replit has stateful memory, an in app IDE, an in app internet browser, and improved the more you used it. It’s like replit but way better lol\n\nCodex can pilot this autonomously for hours at a time (see readme), and has. The core LLM I used is Gemini because it’s free, but this can be changed to GPT very easily with very minimal alterations to the code (simply change the model used and the api call function). Llama could also be plugged in.",

      "text": "we got tired of writing one-off scripts for simple scraping jobs (product listings, search results, directories, tables ) so we built a Chrome extension called Detect and Extract that handles the common cases without writing a single line of code.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1.  Click the extension icon on any page, it automatically detects data structures (tables, lists, grids, card layouts, etc.)\n2.   Preview the data in a grid, rename or delete columns you don't need\n3.   Export as CSV, Excel, JSON, or copy straight to clipboard\n\n The part we are most proud of, multi-page crawling:\n\n*   Point it at the \"Next\" button or page numbers, and it'll auto-crawl through all pages\n*   Handles numbered pagination (1, 2, 3...) and \"Next >\" button patterns\n*   Auto-detects and dismisses modal popups that block the page during crawls (upgrade prompts, cookie banners, etc.)\n*   Built-in deduplication so you don't get repeat rows across pages\n\n  Other stuff:\n\n*  Visual element picker — if auto-detection misses something, click any element on the page and it finds all similar items\n*  Presets — save your scraping config per site so you don't have to set it up again next time\n*  Minimal permissions — only uses activeTab, no background data collection, no account required\n*  Works on most sites — e-commerce, directories, forums, search results, dashboards\n\n  What it's NOT:\n\n*   Not a Selenium/Puppeteer replacement — this is for visual, interactive scraping\n*   Won't bypass anti-bot measures or CAPTCHAs\n*   Not great for SPAs that require authentication flows or infinite nested navigation\n\n\n\nTrying to make it a solid free tool for people who need quick data without spinning up a whole scraping pipeline.\n\nWould love feedback from this community. What features would make this more useful for your workflows?\n\n[Detect and Extract](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/detect-and-extract/kkmibnjkdelljnkoibconbnaenpliefi)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lj6mmc2xg7jg1.png?width=1681&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a0545a48f68145697e2a74d99da783ae07320da\n\n  \nHeads up about the install warning: If you have Chrome's Enhanced Safe Browsing turned on (Chrome Settings > Privacy), you'll see a \"Proceed with caution\" dialog when installing. This is completely normal for all newly published extensions it's not a security issue with the extension itself. Google flags every new extension until it builds up a trust score over time through installs and automated safety reviews. Just click \"Continue to install\" and it works fine. Users with Standard Safe Browsing won't see this at all.  \nReference URL [Regarding that warning](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2664769?visit_id=639065601437510841-3127678855&p=cws_enhanced_safe_browsing&rd=1#10745467)  \n",

      "text": "Through years of webscraping, a huge issue I faced is discrepancy between data types and extraction types and varying website formats.\n\n\n\nA website that has an API, some html docs, json within the html, multiple potential formats and versions etc. all need code flows to extract the same data. And then, how do you have resiliency and consistency in data extraction when the value is usually in place A with an xpath, sometimes place B with a json, and as a last resort regex search for place C?\n\n\n\nMy framework, chadselect, pulls html json and raw text into one class that allows selection across all 4 extraction frameworks (xpath, css, regex, jmespath) to build consistent data collection.\n\n    cs = ChadSelect()\n    cs.add_html('<>some html</>')\n\n    result = cs.select_first([\n        (0, \"css:#exact-id\"),\n        (0, \"xpath://span[@class='alt']/text()\"),\n        (0, r\"regex:fallback:\\s*(.+)\"),\n    ])\n    \n\n  \nOne more addition, common xpath functions like normalize space, trim, substring, replace are built into all selectors - not only limited to xpath anymore. Callable with simple '>>' piping:\n\n    result = cs.select(0, \"css:.vin >> substring-after('VIN: ') >> substring(0, 3) >> lowercase()\")\n    \n\n  \nFuthermore, it's already preconfigured with what I've found to be the fastest engines for each type of querying (lxml, selectolax, re, and jmespath). So hopefully it will be a boost to consistency, dev convenience, and execution time.\n\n\n\nI'm trying to get into open sourcing some projects and frameworks I've built. It would mean the world to me if this was useful to anyone. Please leave issues or comments for any bugs or feature requests. \n\n\n\nThank you for your time\n\n  \n\n\n[https://github.com/markjacksoncerberus/chadselect](https://github.com/markjacksoncerberus/chadselect)\n\n[https://pypi.org/project/chadselect/](https://pypi.org/project/chadselect/)\n\n[https://crates.io/crates/chadselect](https://crates.io/crates/chadselect)",

Some people say reusing cookies is important if you want sessions to look normal and avoid getting blocked, especially on sites with logins or multi-step flows. Others warn that reusing cookies is risky and can actually cause more problems if you carry over bad state or get a session flagged.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen so far, starting with a fresh session every time sometimes works, but other times it feels like sites expect continuity. Reusing cookies seems to make things more stable in those cases, but I’m never sure how long is too long or when a session should be thrown away and rebuilt.\n\nI’m trying to figure out what actually works in real-world scraping, not just in theory. Do people here mostly reuse cookies, rotate them often, or avoid them unless absolutely needed? Have cookies been a bigger source of trouble than things like IPs or headers over time?\n\nCurious to hear how others approach this and what you’ve learned from experience.",

I’ve actually had scrapers that zip up their chrome profile and upload to s3 when they’re done, then redownload it when they start again. \n\n—————-\n\nThe biggest advantage a scraper has vs history based blocking is that **they can only query data they can access in milliseconds**. It is not acceptable virtually anywhere to add 200ms to every request. \n\nWhat this means is that you only need the basics - a number of requests previously seen, an ideally distant start date, and an ideally recent end date. That’s the kind of data most places can quickly cache in volume. \n\nSimilarly (for cookie forging) a remarkable number of places will accept a uuid as legitimate just because it should be a uuid and is a uuid, and cache misses and syncing between multiple nodes is a common issue with real users. \n\nThis can get a little hairy once captchas start rendering and you don’t solve them.

That's a net positive, fewer challenge pages, faster requests, lower detection risk. The key is rotating them before expiry and not sharing a single cookie across multiple IPs.\n\nFor simpler sites, fresh sessions work fine. The overhead of cookie management isn't worth it if the site doesn't track session state for bot detection.\n\nThe real risk with cookie reuse is carrying a flagged session forward. If one request gets soft-blocked (CAPTCHA, rate limit warning), that cookie is burned.

Some things I picked up so far:\n\n\\- Raw data isn't enough. Adding computed fields like deal detection, engagement scoring, and price tracking across runs makes the output way more useful than a static dump.\n\n\\- European platforms have aggressive anti-bot compared to US sites from my research. Took real effort to get stable.\n\n\\- You don't need a browser for everything. Keeping it lightweight makes a huge difference.\n\n\\- Biggest lesson learned... was how much I hate DataDome. I was able to slip past it a few times, but usually blocked the next run. I eventually learned to just go around it if possible.\n\nStill early in this spcraping. What should I be learning next? What separates a decent scraper from a great one?  Thanks!",

My main goal was to understand how to structure a scraper that works across different site types instead of writing one off scripts.\n\nI would really appreciate feedback on:\n\nScraping approach and reliability  \nWhen to prefer RSS vs HTML vs browser based scraping  \nHow to make this more robust or simpler  \nAny bad practices you notice\n\nRepository link:  \n[https://github.com/monish-exz/ai-daily-tech-news-automation](https://github.com/monish-exz/ai-daily-tech-news-automation)\n\nThanks for taking a look.",

If you refresh daily thats quick enough.\n\nFor me <10 hours is plenty quick. But I often don't have very strict latency requirements. Most of my jobs need to keep up on a \"daily basis\"\n\nThe difficulty is often:\n\n1. Walking pages linearly may get you blocked on WAF nowadays.\n2. Sites that stop serving data after N amount of records, because they don't expect anyone to realistically scan through literal hunrdeds or thousands of records.\n\nIn this case, you'll have to deal with navigation through categories, parametric filters, etc. to reduce the dataset that can be crawled completely.\n\n3. Sites that don't have a way of putting new/modified records in front. I fetch quite a lot of listings and always will look for a \"newest first\" kind of sorting. Fortunately for many sites this is their default. I stop crawling as soon as I see data that I've already crawled.",

It processes license data for different states.\n\nScale: We have about 20 separate Windows Services running in parallel on the same server, each scraping different data sources.\n\nTech Stack: C# .NET, Selenium WebDriver, Chrome (Headless).\n\nVersion: Chrome & Driver are both version 144.0.x.x (Versions are matched).\n\nThe Issue:\n\nEverything was running smoothly until recently. Now, I am getting a WebDriverException claiming it cannot start the driver service on a specific localhost port.\n\nthe exception:\n\nCannot start the driver service on http://localhost:54853/\n\nThe Stack Trace:\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.DriverService.Start()\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.DriverServiceCommandExecutor.Execute(Command commandToExecute)\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriver.Execute(String driverCommandToExecute, Dictionary\\`2 parameters)\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriver.StartSession(ICapabilities desiredCapabilities)\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.Chromium.ChromiumDriver..ctor(ChromiumDriverService service, ChromiumOptions options, TimeSpan commandTimeout)\n\nat MyNamespace.LicenseProject.Business.Vermont.VermontLicenseService.ProcessLicense() in ...\\\\VermontLicenseService.cs:line 228\n\ncode:\n\nvar options = new ChromeOptions();\n\noptions.AddArgument(\"--headless\");\n\noptions.AddArgument(\"--no-sandbox\");\n\noptions.AddArgument(\"--disable-dev-shm-usage\");\n\n// I am explicitly setting the driver directory\n\nvar service = ChromeDriverService.CreateDefaultService(driverPath);\n\nservice.HideCommandPromptWindow = true;\n\n// Error implies it fails right here:\n\nusing (var driver = new ChromeDriver(service, options, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2)))\n\n{\n\n// scraping logic\n\n}\n\nWhat I've Tried/Verified:\n\nVersion Mismatch: Double-checked that the chromedriver.exe version matches the installed Chrome browser version (144.0.x.x).\n\nManual Run: The scraper works fine when I run it as a console app/user mode. It only fails when running as a Windows Service.\n\nCleanup: I suspected \"zombie\" chrome processes were eating up ports, so I added logic to kill orphaned chrome processes, but the issue persists.\n\nHas anyone managed high-volume Selenium instances in a Windows Service environment and seen this port binding error?\n\nAny pointers would be appreciated!",

But here is what I think is happening, with 20 parallel services, they're likely clashing on the default user data directory. You should try and set unique user data directories per service instance.\n\nAlso I suspect the driver might be failing to bind, you could let chromedriver pick its own port, by setting service.Port=0.\n\nIf neither of these help, I'd bet it's a session 0 isolation problem. I believe even in headless, chrome sometimes needs to create a window station or access GDI resources that are restricted in Session 0. So you could try running the service under a specific user account with 'allow service to interact with service'\n\nOr it could even be the headless flags too. \nTry the new headless mode\n```\n--headless=new\n```\nYou could also add other options, disable gpu, extensions,software rasterizer,force color profile to be srgb\n\nBut I would mostly look into the user data directory or session 0 isolation.",

Have people had better luck running this kind of thing from a “real” environment? Or is the honest answer: if Turnstile is there, automation just isn’t welcome? Would love to hear how others have dealt with this in practice. \n\nThanks 🙏",
