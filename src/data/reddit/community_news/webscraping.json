      "text": "A few months ago I shared my Python tool for fetching YouTube data. After feedback, I refactored everything and added some features with 2.0 version.\n\nHere's the new features:\n\n* Get structured comments alongside with transcript and metadata.\n* `ytfetcher` is now fully synchronous, simplifying usage and architecture.\n* Pre-Filter videos based on metadata such as `view_count`, `duration` and `title`.\n* Fetch data with playlist id or search query to similar to Youtube Search Bar.\n* Simpler CLI usage.\n\nI also solved a very critical bug with this version which is metadata and transcripts are might not be aligned properly.\n\nI still have a lot of futures to add. So if you guys have any suggestions I'd love to hear.\n\nHere's the full changelog if you want to check; \n\n[https://github.com/kaya70875/ytfetcher/releases/tag/v2.0](https://github.com/kaya70875/ytfetcher/releases/tag/v2.0)",

          "text": "Hey!\n\nYou've basically hit the wall where HTTP-level scraping stops being practical. Akamai Bot Manager with sensor.js is specifically designed to detect the difference between real browsers and automation.\n\nTo answer your conceptual question directly:\n\n1. **Reproducing sensor payloads manually** - theoretically possible but a nightmare to maintain. The fingerprint includes WebGL rendering, canvas, audio context, and dozens of other signals that change with Akamai updates\n\n2. **Full browser with real interaction** - this works but you need the browser to actually execute the JS and pass the challenges. The cookie harvesting approach others mentioned is the right idea\n\n3. **Alternative data sources** - for flight data specifically, Google Flights pulls from the same GDS systems. Some airlines also have affiliate/partner APIs that are less protected\n\nThe practical boundary: if a site invests in Akamai Bot Manager, they've decided to make scraping hard. You either invest equally in bypassing it (real browsers, residential IPs, proper session handling) or find a different data source.\n\nFor personal research at low volume, a real browser with residential IP and human-like delays might work. But it'll be fragile.\n\nGood luck!",

But honestly, if the site is running Akamai Bot Manager (not just basic Akamai CDN), pure HTTP scraping becomes a cat-and-mouse game. Their sensor.js collects browser fingerprints that are hard to fake without actual JS execution.\n\nYou might want to check if the site has a mobile app or public API - sometimes those have lighter protections than the web frontend.\n\nGood luck!",

It also downloads artifacts like PDFs/others . It’s incredibly fast, so it can run on AWS Lambdas or any Cloud Provider, and it supports rendering (via Chrome CDP, if --render flag). Additionally, it has an internal reverse proxy with proxy rotation to facilitate scraping (when CDP, to not relaunch chrome instances, this is not for normal HTTP reqs). Mojo can scrape full websites in seconds while using very low CPU and RAM. Precompiled binaries are also available.",
