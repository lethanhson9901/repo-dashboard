So it's always under heavy testing from me; most of the time, I find issues before users report them because of that.\n\nRegarding security, before switching to Web Scraping, I spent about 8 years in the information security field, including bug hunting. So I was an ethical hacker before all of that. And I spent some time working as backend.",

But then they pass back js that profiles the browser apis to suspicious requests and the payload in that js is constantly changing. So at least for those requests you would need to either mock the entire surface of the browser Api and return what they would consider reasonable values (at that point just using a browser is likely far easier). Won’t say it’s 100% not possible but unless your trick is proxying through some other process that is actually getting around all the protection you won’t be bypassing  cloudflare or Akami purely with requests.",

      "text": "we got tired of writing one-off scripts for simple scraping jobs (product listings, search results, directories, tables ) so we built a Chrome extension called Detect and Extract that handles the common cases without writing a single line of code.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1.  Click the extension icon on any page, it automatically detects data structures (tables, lists, grids, card layouts, etc.)\n2.   Preview the data in a grid, rename or delete columns you don't need\n3.   Export as CSV, Excel, JSON, or copy straight to clipboard\n\n The part we are most proud of, multi-page crawling:\n\n*   Point it at the \"Next\" button or page numbers, and it'll auto-crawl through all pages\n*   Handles numbered pagination (1, 2, 3...) and \"Next >\" button patterns\n*   Auto-detects and dismisses modal popups that block the page during crawls (upgrade prompts, cookie banners, etc.)\n*   Built-in deduplication so you don't get repeat rows across pages\n\n  Other stuff:\n\n*  Visual element picker — if auto-detection misses something, click any element on the page and it finds all similar items\n*  Presets — save your scraping config per site so you don't have to set it up again next time\n*  Minimal permissions — only uses activeTab, no background data collection, no account required\n*  Works on most sites — e-commerce, directories, forums, search results, dashboards\n\n  What it's NOT:\n\n*   Not a Selenium/Puppeteer replacement — this is for visual, interactive scraping\n*   Won't bypass anti-bot measures or CAPTCHAs\n*   Not great for SPAs that require authentication flows or infinite nested navigation\n\n\n\nTrying to make it a solid free tool for people who need quick data without spinning up a whole scraping pipeline.\n\nWould love feedback from this community. What features would make this more useful for your workflows?\n\n[Detect and Extract](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/detect-and-extract/kkmibnjkdelljnkoibconbnaenpliefi)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lj6mmc2xg7jg1.png?width=1681&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a0545a48f68145697e2a74d99da783ae07320da\n\n  \nHeads up about the install warning: If you have Chrome's Enhanced Safe Browsing turned on (Chrome Settings > Privacy), you'll see a \"Proceed with caution\" dialog when installing. This is completely normal for all newly published extensions it's not a security issue with the extension itself. Google flags every new extension until it builds up a trust score over time through installs and automated safety reviews. Just click \"Continue to install\" and it works fine. Users with Standard Safe Browsing won't see this at all.  \nReference URL [Regarding that warning](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2664769?visit_id=639065601437510841-3127678855&p=cws_enhanced_safe_browsing&rd=1#10745467)  \n",

Some things I picked up so far:\n\n\\- Raw data isn't enough. Adding computed fields like deal detection, engagement scoring, and price tracking across runs makes the output way more useful than a static dump.\n\n\\- European platforms have aggressive anti-bot compared to US sites from my research. Took real effort to get stable.\n\n\\- You don't need a browser for everything. Keeping it lightweight makes a huge difference.\n\n\\- Biggest lesson learned... was how much I hate DataDome. I was able to slip past it a few times, but usually blocked the next run. I eventually learned to just go around it if possible.\n\nStill early in this spcraping. What should I be learning next? What separates a decent scraper from a great one?  Thanks!",

      "text": "Hey folks I'm trying to do some light scraping against a Cloudflare-protected site and I’m running into issues. Was wondering if anyone experienced can provide some advice/tips.\n\n**What I’m doing**\n\nUse a stealth browser (e.g., nodriver) to load the target page and complete whatever Cloudflare presents (no issues with this, i get the cf bypassed and cf clearance cookie).\n\nAfter the browser run, I extract cookies (notably cf_clearance, plus any other set cookies) and then switch to a lightweight HTTP client (curl-cffi) for the actual requests.\n\nThe browser is pinned to a specific UA / UA-latest (e.g., “Chrome v144” UA string).\n\nIn curl-cffi, I attach the cookie jar + headers and use an impersonation profile like impersonate=\"chrome-latest\".\n\n**The issue**\n\nEven with the cookies present, several times the curl-cffi request still gets hit with a Cloudflare challenge again even though the cookies has not expired (could have been just retrieved 5 seconds ago).\n\n**any idea why this is happening? my current hypothesis right now is -**\n\nIs this happening because the clearance/session is bound to signals beyond cookies, like:\n\n* UA + TLS fingerprint mismatch (stealth browser chrome-latest profile might be say “Chrome 144” vs curl-cffi “chrome-latest” might be Chrome 143 or something?)\n* Or could it be something else?\n\nQuestions\n\n* How important is it to match the stealth browser version with the curl-cffi version? If this is indeed the underlying issue, whats the best way to \"synchronize\" the chrome version profile in the stealth browser vs the curl-cffi chrome version profile it is using? I don't want to pin it specifically to a version like chrome v144 because then i have to go every single time and update the version manually (and if the version gets too old it likely will trigger an anti-bot challenge as well).\n\n* Is this potential mismatch an issue, or is curl-cffi just not great and triggers the cf challenge often?",

But also the order. What curl-cffi does for you, is spoof the same TLS algorithms/options and HTTP header values, including the orderening.\n\nNow there is 1 caveat: some TLS browsers (Chrome‚ do some \"greasing\" to randomize TLS order iirc. But HTTP does not. So there are various fingerprints like JA3 and JA4(H) that represents these properties.\n\nWAF look at these properties to determine if a browser is real. If any of these is off, its a giant red flag. TLS and HTTP fingerprints don't change per user or OS, but it can change per browser type and version.\n\nOne problem with curl-cffi though: the spoofing is quite static. And in their infinite wisedom in the latest versions, they're hard coding their headers \\*inside\\* the curl executable.\n\nSec-Fetch-Dest for example, specifies what kind of page the browser is expecting to be requested. For HTML pages this is \"document\", but for CSS, javascript or images this is different. Even iframes get denoted as such. I personally haven't encountered many sites that directly blocks access if you get these wrong (maybe video embeds that get denied if you open that page in a separate tab).. but I won't be surprised if some WAF monitor these headers for bot detection, and we'll see more 403's if you get them wrong.",

Two weeks later my hyper focus has me deep in this.\n\nSo far Ive built about a dozen tools for different sites at different difficulty levels and theyve worked... mostly. Now I hit a site that seems like it might require a proxy.\n\nBut my real question is not just “should I use a proxy” ..its how do you reason about access patterns and anti-bot defenses before deciding to add infrastructure like proxies?\n\nE.g. Recently I ran into another harder site and most advice online just said use proxies. I didnt want to jump straight to paying for infrastructure so I kept digging. Eventually I found a post suggesting trying the mobile app. I did a MITM looked at the mobile API and that ended up working with a high success rate.\n\nThat made me realize if I had just followed the first advice I saw I wouldnt have learned anything.\n\nSo how do you decide when something truly requires proxies versus when you just havent found the right access pattern yet. Are there signals you look for or is it mostly experience.",

          "text": "A small tip: everyone says \"just use proxies\" because they sell proxies.\n\n  \nNow, true scalable web scraping starts from tricks like the one you did, but most of the time if the app is serious enough it won't work at all. More and more apps have anti-bot protected endpoints to the point the MITM gets detected straight away unless you're using an actual Android device connected through ADB to your computer.\n\nMy rule of thumb is, you ONLY use proxies when you need to scale or you need more concurrent requests and you start getting blocked because of that usage pattern. It doesn't make sense to start using proxies if you can't reliably bypass protections first.\n\nAlso don't go straight for \"residential\" or \"mobile\" proxies. Try cheap datacenter proxies first, they can take you very far for quite a lot of things!! But of course they have their limitations too, mainly due to their IP reputation. For example, in your use case, since I'm guessing you found an unprotected endpoint, they might still have some rate limiting in place, so you'll get 429's pretty often, the way to bypass that is to have for example 100 datacenter proxies and making requests in each of those proxies. If you found out that the limit of requests per IP is of about 50 reqs/min, then you can have 50 reqs/min \\* amount of proxies you have.",

Now I'm not hammering sites like I'm DDOSing them -- but more like: ooh I've launched 3 jobs in parallel? Oh well, I'm not getting 429 (Too Many Requests) so everything just sails smoothly.\n\nAnd its not like most of my scrapers run jobs that often (most of them only have to complete once a day, some on a hourly basis).\n\nBut still, I do have a few that launches the indexer every 1-2min. And then on top comes new content to grab, plus any images, ajax data, etc. on top. It all adds up and even though I could set really long delays between everything, its still nice to see everything being pulled in swiftly with minimal latency.\n\nAnother advantage: if one IP does get blocked for some duration, I'm not bothered about it at all. All my scripts auto-retry failed jobs. If I'm scraping from 1 IP, 24/7, refreshing the index every 2 minutes.. yeah I'm guessing I will be blocked within a few hours to days. So this is also about redundancy than necessary to function.\n\nFood for thought: if you rely on one proxy provider, and for whatever reason that provider goes down, they are getting blocked by Cloudflare, or they pull the plug for their service, what do you do? At present, I'm DIY'ing a lot of my proxy management, rotation and cloudflare challenges. But inevitably that script will break someday and even though I've redundant proxies, I do not have redundant scraping strategies. So I'm thinking about adding 1 or even 2 tiers of backup strategies in case that fails. Things like scraping APIs that promise a turn-key solution for grabbing HTML from the web, but cost a lot more $$$ per request. But for commercial jobs, it may be worth using if a script falls over on the weekend or holiday due to some (semi-)foreseeable cause.",

The hardest was the first one I did, UT Austin, and also the real hardest part was creating the system that handles everything once the data is obtained and allows me to work with differentiating data across different universities. \n\n  \nAlso Stanford was hard to scrape cause I had to use Selenium to get Javascript rendered data.\n\n  \nWeb scraping is definitely the backbone of this project so hopefully some of you guys here find this interesting. \n\nThe only reason I kept this project going and didn't give up is because I always had in my mind that it would be very scalable, and I think it is.

      "text": "Hi everyone,  \nI’m running a SaaS that provides scraping services, and I’m currently struggling with payment processing.\n\nStripe, Paddle, and Lemonsqueezy have all declined us due to the nature of the business. I understand that this niche is often classified as high-risk, but in practice we’ve been operating for 5 months with **zero chargebacks or disputes**. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to matter much to decision-makers at most payment platforms — scraping services are automatically flagged as high risk.\n\nI’d like to ask those of you who are running SaaS products in similar areas (scraping, data extraction, automation, etc.):\n\n* Which payment processors or merchant accounts are you using to accept credit card payments?\n* Are there providers that are more tolerant or experienced with this type of business?\n* Any recommendations or experiences you’re willing to share would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance — I’d really value hearing from others who’ve dealt with this problem.",

Most of my jobs need to keep up on a \"daily basis\"\n\nThe difficulty is often:\n\n1. Walking pages linearly may get you blocked on WAF nowadays.\n2. Sites that stop serving data after N amount of records, because they don't expect anyone to realistically scan through literal hunrdeds or thousands of records.\n\nIn this case, you'll have to deal with navigation through categories, parametric filters, etc. to reduce the dataset that can be crawled completely.\n\n3. Sites that don't have a way of putting new/modified records in front. I fetch quite a lot of listings and always will look for a \"newest first\" kind of sorting. Fortunately for many sites this is their default. I stop crawling as soon as I see data that I've already crawled.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been banging my head against a wall for a week with a Selenium ChromeDriver issue and could use some fresh eyes.\n\nThe Context:\n\nI have a web scraping tool running as a background Windows Service. It processes license data for different states.\n\nScale: We have about 20 separate Windows Services running in parallel on the same server, each scraping different data sources.\n\nTech Stack: C# .NET, Selenium WebDriver, Chrome (Headless).\n\nVersion: Chrome & Driver are both version 144.0.x.x (Versions are matched).\n\nThe Issue:\n\nEverything was running smoothly until recently. Now, I am getting a WebDriverException claiming it cannot start the driver service on a specific localhost port.\n\nthe exception:\n\nCannot start the driver service on http://localhost:54853/\n\nThe Stack Trace:\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.DriverService.Start()\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.DriverServiceCommandExecutor.Execute(Command commandToExecute)\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriver.Execute(String driverCommandToExecute, Dictionary\\`2 parameters)\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriver.StartSession(ICapabilities desiredCapabilities)\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.Chromium.ChromiumDriver..ctor(ChromiumDriverService service, ChromiumOptions options, TimeSpan commandTimeout)\n\nat MyNamespace.LicenseProject.Business.Vermont.VermontLicenseService.ProcessLicense() in ...\\\\VermontLicenseService.cs:line 228\n\ncode:\n\nvar options = new ChromeOptions();\n\noptions.AddArgument(\"--headless\");\n\noptions.AddArgument(\"--no-sandbox\");\n\noptions.AddArgument(\"--disable-dev-shm-usage\");\n\n// I am explicitly setting the driver directory\n\nvar service = ChromeDriverService.CreateDefaultService(driverPath);\n\nservice.HideCommandPromptWindow = true;\n\n// Error implies it fails right here:\n\nusing (var driver = new ChromeDriver(service, options, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2)))\n\n{\n\n// scraping logic\n\n}\n\nWhat I've Tried/Verified:\n\nVersion Mismatch: Double-checked that the chromedriver.exe version matches the installed Chrome browser version (144.0.x.x).\n\nManual Run: The scraper works fine when I run it as a console app/user mode. It only fails when running as a Windows Service.\n\nCleanup: I suspected \"zombie\" chrome processes were eating up ports, so I added logic to kill orphaned chrome processes, but the issue persists.\n\nHas anyone managed high-volume Selenium instances in a Windows Service environment and seen this port binding error?\n\nAny pointers would be appreciated!",

But here is what I think is happening, with 20 parallel services, they're likely clashing on the default user data directory. You should try and set unique user data directories per service instance.\n\nAlso I suspect the driver might be failing to bind, you could let chromedriver pick its own port, by setting service.Port=0.\n\nIf neither of these help, I'd bet it's a session 0 isolation problem. I believe even in headless, chrome sometimes needs to create a window station or access GDI resources that are restricted in Session 0. So you could try running the service under a specific user account with 'allow service to interact with service'\n\nOr it could even be the headless flags too. \nTry the new headless mode\n```\n--headless=new\n```\nYou could also add other options, disable gpu, extensions,software rasterizer,force color profile to be srgb\n\nBut I would mostly look into the user data directory or session 0 isolation.",
