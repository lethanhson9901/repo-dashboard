I needed a tool I could call with parameters and forget about.\n\nSo I built litecrawl: one async function that manages its own state in SQLite.\n\nThe idea is you spin up a separate instance per use case. Each gets its own DB file, its own cron job, its own config. No orchestration, no shared state, no central scheduler. Just isolated, idempotent processes that pick up where they left off.\n\n    from litecrawl import litecrawl\n    \n    litecrawl(\n        sqlite_path=\"council.db\",\n        start_urls=[\"https://example.com/minutes\"],\n        include_patterns=[r\"https://example\\.com/minutes/\\d+\"],\n        n_concurrent=5,\n        fresh_factor=0.5\n    )\n\nIt handles the boring-but-important stuff:\n\n* Adaptive scheduling - backs off for static pages, speeds up for frequently changing content\n* Crash recovery - claims pages with row-level locking, releases stalled jobs automatically\n* Content hashing - only flags pages as \"fresh\" when something actually changed\n* SSRF protection - validates all resolved IPs, not just the first one\n* robots.txt - cached per domain with async fetching\n* Downloads - catches PDFs/ZIPs that trigger downloads instead of navigation\n\nDesigned to run via cron wrapped in `timeout`. If it crashes or gets killed, the next run continues where it left off.\n\n`pip install litecrawl`\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/jakobmwang/litecrawl](https://github.com/jakobmwang/litecrawl)\n\nBuilt this for various data projects.

If it still has perfect correlation then that suggests they are getting the data from somewhere else.\n\nI apply a similar technique for scraping articles from sites. I will look for a post & modify dates in the <meta> tags, search engine JSON or a custom parser from the HTML. If there is nothing found, then I will default the date tag to the time of the page load, which has limited value but at least its timestamped. I also need these dates for orderings and the like.",

It keeps concerns separated and shows you can work outside the Next ecosystem — good for CV. You can run it on a schedule and push data to your Postgres DB.\n\n**Tools for JS-rendered pages:**\n- **Playwright** — modern, fast, great for scrolling/waiting for content\n- **Puppeteer** — also solid, works well\n\n**Basic approach:**\n1. Load page with Playwright\n2. Scroll to trigger lazy loading (`page.evaluate(() => window.scrollBy(0, 1000))`)\n3. Wait for new content (`page.waitForSelector`)\n4. Extract data\n5. Repeat until all content loaded\n\n**Example pattern:**\n```javascript\nwhile (hasMoreContent) {\n  await page.evaluate(() => window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight));\n  await page.waitForTimeout(1000);\n  // check if new items appeared\n}\n```\n\nGood luck with the project!",

And F5, you're right, the DOM changed again.\n\nSo basically, I need a HTML DOM parser that folds all these CSS classes together and makes CSS properties accessible. Much alike the \"Computed\" tab in the element inspector of a browser. If I can then write a tree selector query for these properties, then I think I'm golden.\n\nI'm using C# by the way. I've looked at AngleSharp with its CSS extension, but it actually crashes on this HTML DOM when trying to \"Render\" the website. It may perhaps be fixable but I'm interested in hearing other suggestions, because I'm certainly not the only one with this issue.\n\nI'm open to libraries from other languages, although, I haven't tried using them so far for this site.\n\nI'm not that interested in AI or Playwright/headless browser solutions, because of overhead costs.",

      "text": "Hello!\n\nI wanted to share my recent project: Tadpole. It is a custom DSL built on top of [KDL](https://kdl.dev/) specifically for web scraping and browser automation.\n\nCheck out the documentation: https://tadpolehq.com/\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/tadpolehq/tadpole\n\n## Why?\nIt is designed to be modular and allows local and remote imports from git repositories. It also allows you to compose and slot complex `actions` and `evaluators`. There's tons of built-in functionality already to build on top of!\n\n### Example\n```kdl\nimport \"modules/redfin/mod.kdl\" repo=\"github.com/tadpolehq/community\"\n\nmain {\n  new_page {\n    redfin.search text=\"=text\"\n    wait_until\n    redfin.extract_from_card extract_to=\"addresses\" {\n      address {\n        redfin.extract_address_from_card\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nand to run it:\n```bash\ntadpole run redfin.kdl --input '{\"text\": \"Seattle, WA\"}' --auto --output output.json\n```\n\nand the output:\n```json\n{\n  \"addresses\": [\n      {\n        \"address\": \"2011 E James St, Seattle, WA 98122\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"address\": \"8020 17th Ave NW, Seattle, WA 98117\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"address\": \"4015 SW Donovan St, Seattle, WA 98136\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"address\": \"116 13th Ave, Seattle, WA 98122\"\n      }\n      ...\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nIt is incredibly powerful to be able to now easily share and reuse scraper code the community creates! There's finally a way to standardize this logic.\n\n## Why not AI?\nAI is not doing a great job in this area, it's also incredibly inefficient and having noticeable environmental impact. People actually like to code.\n\n## Why not just Puppeteer?\nTadpole doesn't just call `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`, commands like `click` and `hover` are actually composed of several actions that use a bezier curve, and ease out functions to try to simulate human behavior. You get the ability to easily abstract away everything into the DSL.  The decentralized package manager also lets you share your code without the additional overhead and complexity that comes with npm or pip.\n\n**Note:** Tadpole is not built on Puppeteer, it implements CDP method calls and manages its own websocket.\n\nThe package was just released! Had a great time dealing with changesets not replacing the `workspace:` prefix. There will be bugs, but I will be actively releasing new features. Hope you guys enjoy this project!\n\nAlso, I created a repository: https://github.com/tadpolehq/community\nfor people to share their scraper code if they want to!",
