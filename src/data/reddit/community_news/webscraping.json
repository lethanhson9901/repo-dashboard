Anyone can utilize google sheets (or any google app with gapps scripting or similar), to fetch/scrape and pull into your sheets, from there you can do anything with your CSV/sheet from there.\n\nMy example was a spreadsheet I made to track houses during house hunting.

Companies whitelist Google/AWS/Azure at the network level for legitimate integrations and forget that anyone can spin up a VM on those same networks.\n\nThe Google Sheets approach works because the request originates from Google's infrastructure, which Zillow trusts implicitly. Same reason Apps Script can hit APIs that block datacenter IPs from other providers.\n\nNot surprised they dismissed the bug report. Fixing it would mean auditing their entire IP whitelist, which probably breaks a dozen internal integrations.",

But then they pass back js that profiles the browser apis to suspicious requests and the payload in that js is constantly changing. So at least for those requests you would need to either mock the entire surface of the browser Api and return what they would consider reasonable values (at that point just using a browser is likely far easier). Won’t say it’s 100% not possible but unless your trick is proxying through some other process that is actually getting around all the protection you won’t be bypassing  cloudflare or Akami purely with requests.",

      "text": "we got tired of writing one-off scripts for simple scraping jobs (product listings, search results, directories, tables ) so we built a Chrome extension called Detect and Extract that handles the common cases without writing a single line of code.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1.  Click the extension icon on any page, it automatically detects data structures (tables, lists, grids, card layouts, etc.)\n2.   Preview the data in a grid, rename or delete columns you don't need\n3.   Export as CSV, Excel, JSON, or copy straight to clipboard\n\n The part we are most proud of, multi-page crawling:\n\n*   Point it at the \"Next\" button or page numbers, and it'll auto-crawl through all pages\n*   Handles numbered pagination (1, 2, 3...) and \"Next >\" button patterns\n*   Auto-detects and dismisses modal popups that block the page during crawls (upgrade prompts, cookie banners, etc.)\n*   Built-in deduplication so you don't get repeat rows across pages\n\n  Other stuff:\n\n*  Visual element picker — if auto-detection misses something, click any element on the page and it finds all similar items\n*  Presets — save your scraping config per site so you don't have to set it up again next time\n*  Minimal permissions — only uses activeTab, no background data collection, no account required\n*  Works on most sites — e-commerce, directories, forums, search results, dashboards\n\n  What it's NOT:\n\n*   Not a Selenium/Puppeteer replacement — this is for visual, interactive scraping\n*   Won't bypass anti-bot measures or CAPTCHAs\n*   Not great for SPAs that require authentication flows or infinite nested navigation\n\n\n\nTrying to make it a solid free tool for people who need quick data without spinning up a whole scraping pipeline.\n\nWould love feedback from this community. What features would make this more useful for your workflows?\n\n[Detect and Extract](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/detect-and-extract/kkmibnjkdelljnkoibconbnaenpliefi)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lj6mmc2xg7jg1.png?width=1681&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a0545a48f68145697e2a74d99da783ae07320da\n\n  \nHeads up about the install warning: If you have Chrome's Enhanced Safe Browsing turned on (Chrome Settings > Privacy), you'll see a \"Proceed with caution\" dialog when installing. This is completely normal for all newly published extensions it's not a security issue with the extension itself. Google flags every new extension until it builds up a trust score over time through installs and automated safety reviews. Just click \"Continue to install\" and it works fine.

Some people say reusing cookies is important if you want sessions to look normal and avoid getting blocked, especially on sites with logins or multi-step flows. Others warn that reusing cookies is risky and can actually cause more problems if you carry over bad state or get a session flagged.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen so far, starting with a fresh session every time sometimes works, but other times it feels like sites expect continuity. Reusing cookies seems to make things more stable in those cases, but I’m never sure how long is too long or when a session should be thrown away and rebuilt.\n\nI’m trying to figure out what actually works in real-world scraping, not just in theory. Do people here mostly reuse cookies, rotate them often, or avoid them unless absolutely needed? Have cookies been a bigger source of trouble than things like IPs or headers over time?\n\nCurious to hear how others approach this and what you’ve learned from experience.",

No history + one of (bad ip, bad history, bad headers) will get you blocked though. \n\nThere are multiple ways to handle this\n\n1) Just accept your 50% success rate and abuse celery’s retry functionality \n\n2) Forge the cookies (integer, timestamp, uuid)\n\n3) Build a history - easier than it sounds. I’ve actually had scrapers that zip up their chrome profile and upload to s3 when they’re done, then redownload it when they start again. \n\n—————-\n\nThe biggest advantage a scraper has vs history based blocking is that **they can only query data they can access in milliseconds**. It is not acceptable virtually anywhere to add 200ms to every request. \n\nWhat this means is that you only need the basics - a number of requests previously seen, an ideally distant start date, and an ideally recent end date. That’s the kind of data most places can quickly cache in volume. \n\nSimilarly (for cookie forging) a remarkable number of places will accept a uuid as legitimate just because it should be a uuid and is a uuid, and cache misses and syncing between multiple nodes is a common issue with real users. \n\nThis can get a little hairy once captchas start rendering and you don’t solve them.

There's no universal rule.\n\nFor sites with Cloudflare or similar protection, reusing a valid session cookie avoids re-solving the challenge on every request. That's a net positive, fewer challenge pages, faster requests, lower detection risk. The key is rotating them before expiry and not sharing a single cookie across multiple IPs.\n\nFor simpler sites, fresh sessions work fine. The overhead of cookie management isn't worth it if the site doesn't track session state for bot detection.\n\nThe real risk with cookie reuse is carrying a flagged session forward. If one request gets soft-blocked (CAPTCHA, rate limit warning), that cookie is burned. You need logic to detect when a session goes stale and swap it out immediately rather than keep hammering with a poisoned session.",

Sites that stop serving data after N amount of records, because they don't expect anyone to realistically scan through literal hunrdeds or thousands of records.\n\nIn this case, you'll have to deal with navigation through categories, parametric filters, etc. to reduce the dataset that can be crawled completely.\n\n3. Sites that don't have a way of putting new/modified records in front. I fetch quite a lot of listings and always will look for a \"newest first\" kind of sorting. Fortunately for many sites this is their default. I stop crawling as soon as I see data that I've already crawled.",

It processes license data for different states.\n\nScale: We have about 20 separate Windows Services running in parallel on the same server, each scraping different data sources.\n\nTech Stack: C# .NET, Selenium WebDriver, Chrome (Headless).\n\nVersion: Chrome & Driver are both version 144.0.x.x (Versions are matched).\n\nThe Issue:\n\nEverything was running smoothly until recently. Now, I am getting a WebDriverException claiming it cannot start the driver service on a specific localhost port.\n\nthe exception:\n\nCannot start the driver service on http://localhost:54853/\n\nThe Stack Trace:\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.DriverService.Start()\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.DriverServiceCommandExecutor.Execute(Command commandToExecute)\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriver.Execute(String driverCommandToExecute, Dictionary\\`2 parameters)\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriver.StartSession(ICapabilities desiredCapabilities)\n\nat OpenQA.Selenium.Chromium.ChromiumDriver..ctor(ChromiumDriverService service, ChromiumOptions options, TimeSpan commandTimeout)\n\nat MyNamespace.LicenseProject.Business.Vermont.VermontLicenseService.ProcessLicense() in ...\\\\VermontLicenseService.cs:line 228\n\ncode:\n\nvar options = new ChromeOptions();\n\noptions.AddArgument(\"--headless\");\n\noptions.AddArgument(\"--no-sandbox\");\n\noptions.AddArgument(\"--disable-dev-shm-usage\");\n\n// I am explicitly setting the driver directory\n\nvar service = ChromeDriverService.CreateDefaultService(driverPath);\n\nservice.HideCommandPromptWindow = true;\n\n// Error implies it fails right here:\n\nusing (var driver = new ChromeDriver(service, options, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2)))\n\n{\n\n// scraping logic\n\n}\n\nWhat I've Tried/Verified:\n\nVersion Mismatch: Double-checked that the chromedriver.exe version matches the installed Chrome browser version (144.0.x.x).\n\nManual Run: The scraper works fine when I run it as a console app/user mode. It only fails when running as a Windows Service.\n\nCleanup: I suspected \"zombie\" chrome processes were eating up ports, so I added logic to kill orphaned chrome processes, but the issue persists.\n\nHas anyone managed high-volume Selenium instances in a Windows Service environment and seen this port binding error?\n\nAny pointers would be appreciated!",

But here is what I think is happening, with 20 parallel services, they're likely clashing on the default user data directory. You should try and set unique user data directories per service instance.\n\nAlso I suspect the driver might be failing to bind, you could let chromedriver pick its own port, by setting service.Port=0.\n\nIf neither of these help, I'd bet it's a session 0 isolation problem. I believe even in headless, chrome sometimes needs to create a window station or access GDI resources that are restricted in Session 0. So you could try running the service under a specific user account with 'allow service to interact with service'\n\nOr it could even be the headless flags too. \nTry the new headless mode\n```\n--headless=new\n```\nYou could also add other options, disable gpu, extensions,software rasterizer,force color profile to be srgb\n\nBut I would mostly look into the user data directory or session 0 isolation.",

Basically, it is designed to start at a particular website's history (the starting page), and click through/scrape the listed data from every \"new\" page linked in the history. It is doing that fine, but I also want to grab the URL associated with each new entry/page. While it is grabbing the Starting URL, it is not grabbing the individual URLs for each page it is going through. For the life of me, I can not figure out the correct Type and Selector. Does anyone have any tips or advice?\n\n  \nP.s. I would want to add this to an existing Parent Selector that already has all my other selectors/data points as subs...",
