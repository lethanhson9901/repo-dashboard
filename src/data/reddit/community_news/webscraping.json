      "text": "A few months ago I shared my Python tool for fetching YouTube data. After feedback, I refactored everything and added some features with 2.0 version.\n\nHere's the new features:\n\n* Get structured comments alongside with transcript and metadata.\n* `ytfetcher` is now fully synchronous, simplifying usage and architecture.\n* Pre-Filter videos based on metadata such as `view_count`, `duration` and `title`.\n* Fetch data with playlist id or search query to similar to Youtube Search Bar.\n* Simpler CLI usage.\n\nI also solved a very critical bug with this version which is metadata and transcripts are might not be aligned properly.\n\nI still have a lot of futures to add. So if you guys have any suggestions I'd love to hear.\n\nHere's the full changelog if you want to check; \n\n[https://github.com/kaya70875/ytfetcher/releases/tag/v2.0](https://github.com/kaya70875/ytfetcher/releases/tag/v2.0)",

Perhaps once I have that I can dump all my learnings into claude code with some scaffolding at get it to write the scraper, but its still quite painful to do. My major time sink is understanding the structure of the site/app and its protections rather than writing the actual code. \n\nI'm not talking about using AI to parse websites, thats the easy bit tbh.

Akamai Bot Manager with sensor.js is specifically designed to detect the difference between real browsers and automation.\n\nTo answer your conceptual question directly:\n\n1. **Reproducing sensor payloads manually** - theoretically possible but a nightmare to maintain. The fingerprint includes WebGL rendering, canvas, audio context, and dozens of other signals that change with Akamai updates\n\n2. **Full browser with real interaction** - this works but you need the browser to actually execute the JS and pass the challenges. The cookie harvesting approach others mentioned is the right idea\n\n3. **Alternative data sources** - for flight data specifically, Google Flights pulls from the same GDS systems. Some airlines also have affiliate/partner APIs that are less protected\n\nThe practical boundary: if a site invests in Akamai Bot Manager, they've decided to make scraping hard. You either invest equally in bypassing it (real browsers, residential IPs, proper session handling) or find a different data source.\n\nFor personal research at low volume, a real browser with residential IP and human-like delays might work. But it'll be fragile.\n\nGood luck!",

Depending on how fast you want to go, you might need 100-1000+ IPs to avoid getting rate-limited by Shopify's shared infrastructure.\n\nAlso shuffle your list so you're not hammering Shopify back-to-back - interleave domains by provider.\n\nFor Shopify detection specifically - try hitting `/products.json` on each domain. Shopify stores expose this endpoint by default, so a 200 response with valid JSON is a quick confirm without parsing HTML. Same idea for other platforms that have predictable endpoints.\n\nGood luck!",

It keeps concerns separated and shows you can work outside the Next ecosystem — good for CV. You can run it on a schedule and push data to your Postgres DB.\n\n**Tools for JS-rendered pages:**\n- **Playwright** — modern, fast, great for scrolling/waiting for content\n- **Puppeteer** — also solid, works well\n\n**Basic approach:**\n1. Load page with Playwright\n2. Scroll to trigger lazy loading (`page.evaluate(() => window.scrollBy(0, 1000))`)\n3. Wait for new content (`page.waitForSelector`)\n4. Extract data\n5. Repeat until all content loaded\n\n**Example pattern:**\n```javascript\nwhile (hasMoreContent) {\n  await page.evaluate(() => window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight));\n  await page.waitForTimeout(1000);\n  // check if new items appeared\n}\n```\n\nGood luck with the project!",

      "text": "I kept hitting the same pattern at work: \"we need to index this specific section of this website, with these rules, on this schedule.\" Each case was slightly different - different URL patterns, different update frequencies, different extraction logic.\n\nScrapy felt like overkill. I didn't need a framework with spiders and pipelines and middleware. I needed a tool I could call with parameters and forget about.\n\nSo I built litecrawl: one async function that manages its own state in SQLite.\n\nThe idea is you spin up a separate instance per use case. Each gets its own DB file, its own cron job, its own config. No orchestration, no shared state, no central scheduler. Just isolated, idempotent processes that pick up where they left off.\n\n    from litecrawl import litecrawl\n    \n    litecrawl(\n        sqlite_path=\"council.db\",\n        start_urls=[\"https://example.com/minutes\"],\n        include_patterns=[r\"https://example\\.com/minutes/\\d+\"],\n        n_concurrent=5,\n        fresh_factor=0.5\n    )\n\nIt handles the boring-but-important stuff:\n\n* Adaptive scheduling - backs off for static pages, speeds up for frequently changing content\n* Crash recovery - claims pages with row-level locking, releases stalled jobs automatically\n* Content hashing - only flags pages as \"fresh\" when something actually changed\n* SSRF protection - validates all resolved IPs, not just the first one\n* robots.txt - cached per domain with async fetching\n* Downloads - catches PDFs/ZIPs that trigger downloads instead of navigation\n\nDesigned to run via cron wrapped in `timeout`. If it crashes or gets killed, the next run continues where it left off.\n\n`pip install litecrawl`\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/jakobmwang/litecrawl](https://github.com/jakobmwang/litecrawl)\n\nBuilt this for various data projects. Would love feedback - especially if you spot edge cases I haven't considered.",

It also downloads artifacts like PDFs/others . It’s incredibly fast, so it can run on AWS Lambdas or any Cloud Provider, and it supports rendering (via Chrome CDP, if --render flag). Additionally, it has an internal reverse proxy with proxy rotation to facilitate scraping (when CDP, to not relaunch chrome instances, this is not for normal HTTP reqs). Mojo can scrape full websites in seconds while using very low CPU and RAM. Precompiled binaries are also available.",
