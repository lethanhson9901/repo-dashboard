Aegis pulls my cloud clips (Ring/Blink wired/battery) locally so I can search them with a private, local LLM. This weekend project honestly would have been impossible without vibe coding—it's allowed me to hit 400k lines of logic at a speed traditional dev couldn't touch.\n\nThe 'GitHub' Model: I believe the future of AI is local.

      "text": "Been hunting for a local daily driver to finally drop paid APIs, and I think I found \"The One.\"\n\nGrabbed the new **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-4bit**, and at first, it was rough. I was getting those classic 4-bit issues: reasoning loops, endless \"Wait, let me check...\" spirals, and failing simple logic traps like the \"Car Wash\" problem.\n\nSpent the day stress-testing it against the [Digital Spaceport Benchmark suite](https://digitalspaceport.com/about/testing-local-llms/) (logic, math, SVG coding, counting). It was hit-or-miss until I realized the model wasn't \"dumb\" it just needed structure. The quantization makes it anxious, so it second-guesses itself into oblivion.\n\n**The Fix:**\n\nTweak the system prompt to force \"Adaptive Logic.\" It separates the scratchpad thinking from the final answer and sets a hard limit on the \"thinking\" phase.\n\nOnce applied this, it passed **100% of the tests** in seconds.\n\n* **Logic:** Solved the \"Pico de Gato\" schedule puzzle perfectly.\n* **Math:** Nailed the \"Two Drivers\" problem without looping.\n* **Coding:** Generated a clean SVG cat on the first try.\n* **Counting:** Actually counted \"Peppermint\" correctly (rare for 4-bit).\n\nNext up, I'm throwing my complex n8n workflows at it to see if it survives. 🤞\n\nIf you're struggling with the 4-bit version, here is the config that unlocked it for me.\n\n**⚙️ The Config**\n\n* **Model:** Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-4bit\n* **Temp:** 0.7 | **Top P:** 0.9 | **Min P:** 0.05 *(Critical!)*\n* **Freq Penalty:** 1.1 | **Repeat Last N:** 64\n\n**🧠 The \"Anti-Loop\" System Prompt**\n\n*(Paste into OpenWebUI/LM Studio)*\n\nPlaintext\n\n    You are a helpful and efficient AI assistant. Your goal is to provide accurate answers without getting stuck in repetitive loops.\n    \n    1. PROCESS: Before generating your final response, you must analyze the request inside <thinking> tags.\n    2. ADAPTIVE LOGIC:\n       - For COMPLEX tasks (logic, math, coding): Briefly plan your approach in NO MORE than 3 steps inside the tags. (Save the detailed execution/work for the final answer).\n       - For CHALLENGES: If the user doubts you or asks you to \"check online,\" DO NOT LOOP. Do one quick internal check, then immediately state your answer.\n       - For SIMPLE tasks: Keep the <thinking> section extremely concise (1 sentence).\n    3. OUTPUT: Once your analysis is complete, close the tag with </thinking>. Then, start a new line with exactly \"### FINAL ANSWER:\" followed by your response.\n    \n    DO NOT reveal your thinking process outside of the tags.\n\nBig love to the Qwen team. You guys genuinely changed the game with this one. Having this running locally is a dream. 🚀",

It’s great having the thinking text to see what the model is considering. I’m on a MacBook Pro M4 48GB. Context max is set to 128k. \nI might borrow some of your prompt. Good tips.",

          "text": "This is an enthusiastic post about optimizing Qwen 3.5 for local automation, but it could be significantly strengthened with a few improvements:\n\n**Improvements:**\n1. **Complete the post**: The content cuts off mid-sentence (\"Two Driv...\"). Finish the full results and provide complete context for readers.\n2. **Share the actual system prompt**: You mention the \"Adaptive Logic\" fix but don't include the exact prompt template. Consider pasting the full prompt so others can replicate your results immediately rather than reverse-engineering it.\n3. **Provide quantitative benchmarks**: Instead of \"100% of tests,\" specify how many tests, what the baseline was, and include timing/performance metrics (latency, token/sec, memory usage).\n4. **Add reproducibility details**: Include your hardware specs (GPU, RAM), inference framework (ollama, vLLM, etc.), and exact model link so others can verify results.\n\n**Alternative Perspectives to Consider:**\n1. **Trade-offs not mentioned**: 4-bit quantization reduces model size but may impact quality on edge cases. Have you tested on tasks outside the benchmark suite?\n2. **Comparison context**: How does this compare to other open models (Llama 3.1, Mistral, DeepSeek) on the same benchmarks? \"The One\" is strong language without comparison data.\n3. **Cost-benefit analysis**: While dropping paid APIs saves money, consider total cost of ownership (hardware, electricity, maintenance time vs. API costs at scale).\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n1. **Survivorship bias**: The \"fix\" worked for your specific setup—different quantization methods, hardware, or use cases may need different tuning.\n2. **Benchmark limitations**: Digital Spaceport tests are useful but narrow. Real-world n8n automation often involves unstructured data, API integration, and error handling that benchmarks don't cover.\n3. **Prompt engineering fragility**: System prompt tweaks can be brittle. Test how sensitive the 100% success rate is to minor prompt variations.\n\n**Additional Resources to Reference:**\n1. Link to the n8n community docs on local LLM integration\n2. Point readers to the actual Qwen model card on Hugging Face for official specs\n3. Mention relevant papers on quantization artifacts and mitigation techniques\n4. Suggest testing frameworks like HELM or LMEval for more rigorous benchmarking\n\n**Tone note**: Your enthusiasm is great for engagement, but ground claims with data. \"The One\" and \"100% success\" will attract skepticism without full context. Lead with reproducible evidence.",

                  "text": "So I'm not certain your specific use case, but I'm doing custom tunes, LoRAs, and RAG databases for game development, along with using it for software development, so I need as much context as I can get.\n\nI also am very high ADHD, so patience isn't my strongest virtue outside of hyperfocus.\n\nSo I tend to use the faster models based more on ones like Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct and Nemotron-3-Nano-30B for most of my grunt work. Depending on performance and the tasks related, I also do use GLM-4.7-Flash a pretty decent amount, and I have various uses/testing I do with models ranging from Devstral-2-Small-24B up to GPT-OSS-120B, Qwen-3-Coder-Next, and I'm messing around with other ones as well that are newer, I just haven't had as much time because my wife is in the hospital and I'm kind of burning my candle at both ends.\n\nI tend to prefer the smaller models and I tend to prefer llama.cpp over vllm. I can run a vllm server on a tiny model and support a ton of users connected, but unfortunately I lose too much context headroom using 30B class models on VLLM, which is about how I feel using 70B to 120B models on llama.cpp\n\nI'm really hoping the impacts from Nemotron 3 help improve the way context is stored for other models and allows them to become more context efficient. It looks like I could run a Q8 of Qwen 3.5 120B, but I'm really looking for their coder release for 3.5.\n\nI think Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct is my biggest workhorse and it's really fast with Claude Code when it's not hallucinating tool calls (something I'm planning to work on, just been busy).\n\nWhen I need to do reasoning, troubleshooting, breaking loops, etc., I definitely don't use Qwen there though, I prefer Nemotron 3 and GLM 4.7 or GPT-OSS-120B depending on what it is.\n\nI would probably do a bit more with GPT-OSS-120B but I'm really still trying to get down how the chain of thought fine tuning. I just took about 400MB of code and had Qwen3-Coder-30B-Instruct write the pairs for it and after inspecting a few hundred of them it actually looks really good, I was quite impressed, but I'm going to need to make another pass over that dataset with Nemotron 3 because some of the data points Qwen didn't have it skipped too much. I'd probably prefer to use GLM-4.7-Flash for that but speed is a factor. With my current setting, before the wind down Nemotron starts around 180 tokens/s output speed, Qwen3-Coder-30B-Instruct is around 140, so these are pretty fast, but GLM-4.7-Flash I'm rocking in the 60s with my current config (I need to see if I can improve it, just haven't had the time) and unfortunately, when you look at something like combing that 400MB of data, it took about 40\\~ hours to do the first pass with Qwen, it would likely take a lot longer with GLM. I might test running it with only two of the cards so I can keep the other two open for use while it processes the data, but we'll see.\n\nI have found I don't particularly care for the low quants of the higher end models. They tend to be inconsistent, often buggy, more prone to loops, and don't provide worthwhile context limits for me to care. Even doing personality tuning I've found better results tuning Qwen3-Coder-30B-Instruct and keeping the high performance than tuning a higher model. For a lot of stuff like conversational AI, I'm practicing tuning even smaller models now as the bigger just isn't necessary.\n\nTesting around though, I have around 8TB of models I'm working with currently.",

I am using LM Studio and OpenCode, and the MLX versions started working just yesterday, with the latest update of LM Studio (before that they would loop endlessly). I don't have the exact figures, but the 35B MoE in 4bit MLX is so fast that I cannot read the output as it sends it out. I tried also the 5bit version with LM Studio's safeties off, but that's really pushing the limit - the computer borked several times, and 5bit did not seem that much better than 4bit.  \nNow we get to the HOWEVER part. The 35B model makes a lot of mistakes. I gave it a simple challenge - create a HTML model of the solar system, meant for children, with tool tips for each planet. The result did not work, and it was clueless about fixing it.  \nTo the rescue - the dense 27B model. It is much slower than the 35B on my setup, to the point that the only possible workflow is to give it a prompt and go and do something else. However, it discovered every CSS and javascript error made by its sibling, and one-shot the fixes. It's reliable, but too slow for comfort.\n\nIf only we had something in between.\n\nMy settings: temperature 0.6, Top K 40, Repeat Penalty 1.1, Top P Sampling 0.9, Min P Sampling 0.05, context size 65536.

My benchmarks are:\n\n32k context = 124tps\n64k context = 123tps\n128k context = 62tps\n256k context = 7tps (yikes, not sure what's going on)\n\nThe unsloth/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL model had an accuracy bug I think so it was not recommended to use it, not sure if that's fixed. It was faster though.\n\n32k context = 137tps\n64k context = 119tps\n128k context = 37tps\n256k context = 42tps\n\nI think this will also replace ChatGPT for me as soon as I can get web search tooling in llama server",

The 122b after a number of attempts created a 'ugly' version of the game.\n\nAnyhow, the most likely answer to your question at this point is: it is too soon to know which one will perform better.\n\nNot to mention that the two models have different purpose, so ideally you should leverage each one in its better performing scenario.",

          "text": "I have a new favourite (after gemma3:27b) for helping me ready difficult Chinese texts. I attach a whole document for context, ask it about a fragment and it's very capable in breaking down and analyzing comlex stuff like Buddhist texts. 27b Q4 works fine on 7900XT.\n\n  \nExample:\n\n*The phrase \"圆满智慧金轮所放光\" (yuánmǎn zhìhuì jīn lún suǒ fàng guāng) translates to \\*\\*\"the light emitted by the perfect/complete wheel of wisdom.\"\\*\\*  Let's break it down:*\n\n*\\* \\*\\*圆满 (yuánmǎn):\\*\\*  Perfect, complete, fulfilled, rounded.  This implies a wisdom that is not fragmented or lacking.*\n\n*\\* \\*\\*智慧 (zhìhuì):\\*\\* Wisdom, intelligence, understanding.*\n\n*\\* \\*\\*金轮 (jīn lún):\\*\\*  Golden wheel.  This is a metaphor deeply rooted in Buddhist imagery.  The \"wheel\" (lún) represents \\*dharmachakra\\* - the Wheel of Dharma, symbolizing the Buddha's teachings and the turning of the law. \"Golden\" (jīn) symbolizes the preciousness and purity of this teaching.*\n\n*\\* \\*\\*所放光 (suǒ fàng guāng):\\*\\*  The light emitted, the light that shines forth.  \\*Suǒ\\* is a grammatical particle indicating \"that which.\"*\n\n*\\*\\*Meaning in the context of the verse:\\*\\**\n\n*This phrase refers to the illuminating power of perfect wisdom (the Buddhist teachings as embodied by Manjushri, as the verse references him). The \"golden wheel\" represents the complete and radiant Buddhist Dharma.  The \"light\" that it emits is the understanding and insight that dispel ignorance.*\n\n*\\*\\*Overall, \"圆满智慧金轮所放光\" paints a vivid image of the powerful, illuminating wisdom of the Buddha's teachings, breaking through the darkness of ignorance.\\*\\* It's a beautiful and evocative metaphor used to highlight the transformative power of enlightenment.*\n\n*The entire verse translates as:*\n\n*\"In that vast expanse of knowledge, the light emitted by the perfect wheel of wisdom*\n\n*Dispels the ignorance and darkness of all beings.*\n\n*I prostrate to Manjushri Buddha, whose wondrous voice I honor.\"*\n\nI remember paying a language teacher to read texts together as a part of learning Chinese. Costed so much money overall. Now I can do it myself. Teacher got automated xD",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nFollowing up on the initial dev support post, I’ve been tracking feedback from about a dozen of you stress-testing Qwen3-Max/Coder. After reviewing several logs and tickets, I’ve noticed a few common \"traps\" that might save you some debugging hours.\n\nHere is a quick technical guide based on real production cases:\n\n1. The \"Safety Filter\" Trap (DataInspectionFailed 400)\n\nA few of you building security tools or regex filters hit an \\`InternalError.Algo.DataInspectionFailed\\`.\n\nThe Cause: Qwen’s safety layer is quite strict. If your code snippet contains sensitive keywords (even for defense logic), the model might flag it.\n\nCurrent Fix: If you hit this wall while building legitimate security tools, drop a comment below. I can sync with the engineering team to review and potentially lift restrictions for your specific use case.\n\n2. Billing vs. Region Syncing\n\nOne dev noted their Coding Plan wasn't being consumed while their credit balance was.\n\nThe Cause: Plans are region-specific. If you bought a plan in the Singapore region but your Base URL points to a different endpoint (like US), it won't trigger the prepaid plan.\n\nFix: Ensure your \\`Base\\_URL\\` matches the region where the plan was purchased. Singapore is currently the most \"feature-complete\" region for global access.\n\n3. Scaling to \"Production-Quality\" Agents\n\nWe’ve seen some massive RAG implementations this week. Qwen 3.5 seems remarkably good at State Mutation and Dependency Checking.\n\nPro-tip: When building complex agents, leverage Qwen’s Self-Healing logic. It’s surprisingly capable of identifying failed tests caused by code pollution and isolating them. If you are aiming for \"Production-grade\" reliability, let the model run its own verification loops.\n\n4. DB Sidekick for Quant/GIS Devs\n\nFor those managing heavy PostgreSQL/MySQL schemas alone, check out the DAS Agent.  It’s basically an AI sidekick for slow SQL analysis and diagnostics. It’s useful if you want to offload database maintenance to an LLM-based agent.\n\nI’m still taking these feedbacks directly to the product team to make the platform more developer-friendly.\n\nP.S.I still have some developer credits left for high-complexity projects (Enterprise RAG, FinTech, or Open Source). If you’re pushing the limits, let me know what you’re building in the comments!",

The free access is ongoing with no expiry, as long as you use it for dev/prototyping (not for serving real users in production).\n\nThe commonly reported rate limit is around **40 requests/minute**, though NVIDIA doesn't publish exact per-model limits and has confirmed they don't plan to. For a coding session that's rarely an issue.\n\nThe real pain point is that popular models especially the S+ tier ones like DeepSeek V3.2 or Qwen3 Coder 480B can be slow or outright overloaded 🔥 during peak hours. That's actually the main reason I built this tool: instead of guessing, you see all 44 models' live latency and uptime at once and switch in one keystroke.",

Paid API from Alibaba works fine \n\nAnd out of two remaining options I would prefer CLI, cause their chat interface is on a very early stage of development",
