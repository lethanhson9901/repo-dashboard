      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently created a skill to be used in the Qwen Code CLI inspired by other tools that are not so friendly with Open Source.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/Abimael10/planning-with-files-qwen](https://github.com/Abimael10/planning-with-files-qwen)\n\nThe initial idea behind it is kind of to transform your workflow to use persistent markdown files for planning, progress tracking, and knowledge storage similar to what the recently adquired Manus AI exposed in this article: [https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus](https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus)\n\nAs of any demo that us 996s can create for the sake of exposure of real usage, I used it to create a demo CRUD service, very simple, using the Axum framework and Rust with screenshots on the very minimal initial prompt that I gave Qwen Code to generate, the code and setup for this generated project is inside the demo folder of the repo, you can cd to it with the required Rust tooling to validate.\n\nThis was the very only initial prompt and the result can be seen in the demo folder of the repo:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/txmaucnuskeg1.png?width=1747&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdf6d8d901163417070362e3f65e914e5951d957\n\nLet me know if this is something that actually can be used for real and if any suggestion or issue, I am completely open even if it just to make it look cleaner for anyone to understand.",

      "text": "Hello friends, I was wondering if you are experiencing the same issues with Alibaba Qwen models as I do. I'm using qwen-flash and qwen-plus in Singapore region for both realtime and batch inference.   \n  \nRealtime response times can go from anything like 50ms response time to 2 minutes for 2.5K context being sent.\n\nBatching with qwen-flash and qwen-plus also fails regularly with errors like ResponseTimeout despite the fact that my request tokens are way below the TPM limits.\n\nI have raised my issues with the customer support and they said it's probably due to their team fixing some scaling issues. This has been going on for 5 days now and I'm wondering is this normal and expected from Alibaba. In my view it's completely unreliable and I should probably move to alternative. \n\n",

As a result I will get that animation, fully editable.\n\nIt's quite similar to code generation in IDEs like cursor, except that the language is represented more visually and the whole environment is geared toward controlling physical devices.",
