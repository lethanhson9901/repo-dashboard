I am working on a 250,000 line SaaS project right now and working largely with Codex 5.3 X high, Opus 4.6 and have used GLM 5 and Kimi 2.5 for reviewing and comparison work. \n\nI had would should have been a simple issue with fly our menus from a compacted side menu, only one worked. Codex had 3 attempts and failed so aftr 3 attempts I would switch to Opus and usually the 'fresh eyes' fix it right away (happens if the issues appears on Opus 4.6 and then introduce codex, it fixes it right away). However, on this occasion both failed after 3 attempts. As it had recently been installed, I asked Qwen to take a look. I explained in the prompt (as I had to Opus) that lateral thinking was required, it the issue was as it first appeared, Codex would have fixed it. \n\n\n\nBoth codex and Opus had suggested the same fault and were looking in that area. Qwen suggested something different, extracted and presented small pieces of code to explain why why there was and issue and how to fix it. Additionally, it pointed out several areas where the code could be improved (a module per pop-out menu was being used, it suggested use one to suit all. simple stuff but neither opus nor codex suggested this.\n\nthe fix worked first time so was exactly as Qwen had suggested and not as either opus or codex had considered \n\n**Optimisation for benchmarking?**\n\nWhilst on Qwen is up there but not topping the charts and having used Qwen to further optimise this project by reducing resource usage on server monitoring by 50%, it got me thinking. in another world of mine I design and optimise high performance directional antennas. These are compared with others on a standard computer model comparison bench. I have optimised models in the past to fair well on benchmarks even though in the real-world applications, a deviance from the bench optimisation shows better results. \n\nPerhaps it is worth trying qwen on your own projects and take a leap of faith. it might be Qwen engineers just haven't worked out how best to 'cheat' the benchmarks yet or perhaps, they just don't want to. \n\nNot read back no edited with AI. However, I am sure you guessed that :-)\n\n\n\n",

I also tested image understanding, it works well and I like to be in the same model. It starts at 17t/s so I am using it as an architect in roocode, till I add more gpus so it can work fast enough to replace qwen coder 80/minimax as coder. It works correctly for tool calls, but I need more gpus. \nThe previous most used one for me has been 235 VL instruct. This is a great step ahead. I am using it in no thinking mode as I always prefer a faster response that for my use cases is good enough. \nThank you for this model!",

I started looking at the perplexity measurements for different models and perplexity isn't a 1:1 but seeing the rate of incorrect tokens explode usually with q4 being the cliff highlights how we are likely experiencing slightly different behaviors from our local models vs the full-size ones. I don't think that getting a different token from the original equates to a non working token but if something is 80% different you wouldn't call it identical either. Based on inferencer labs' HF for the model, q4 is around 90% accuracy. 1 out of every 10 tokens being different would make these local results make sense. It becomes a signal to noise issue for models with heavier quantization.\n\nPerfect timing describing quantization affect on token accuracy- \nhttps://youtu.be/Mq6FQIZ-GMw",

      "text": "\\[Solution Found\\] Qwen3-Next 80B MoE running at 39 t/s on RTX 5070 Ti + 5060 Ti (32GB VRAM) - The fix nobody else figured out\n\nHey fellow 50 series brothers in pain,\n\nI've been banging my head against this for a while and finally cracked it through pure trial and error. Posting this so nobody else has to suffer.\n\nMy Hardware:\n\n\n\nRTX 5070 Ti (16GB VRAM)\n\nRTX 5060 Ti (16GB VRAM)\n\n32GB total VRAM\n\n64GB System RAM\n\nWindows 11\n\nllama.cpp b8077 (CUDA 12.4 build)\n\nModel: Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct-UD-IQ2\\_XXS.gguf (26.2GB)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Problem:\n\nOut of the box, Qwen3-Next was running at 6.5 tokens/sec with:\n\n\n\nCPU usage 25-55% going absolutely insane during thinking AND generation\n\nGPUs sitting at 0% during thinking phase\n\n5070 Ti at 5-10% during generation\n\n5060 Ti at 10-40% during generation\n\n\\~34GB of system RAM being consumed\n\nModel clearly bottlenecked on CPU\n\n\n\nEvery suggestion I found online said the same generic things:\n\n\n\n\"Check your n\\_gpu\\_layers\" ✅ already 999, all 49 layers on GPU\n\n\"Check your tensor split\" ✅ tried everything\n\n\"Use CUDA 12.8+\" ✅ not the issue\n\n\"Your offloading is broken\" ❌ WRONG - layers were fully on GPU\n\n\n\nThe load output PROVED layers were on GPU:\n\nload\\_tensors: offloaded 49/49 layers to GPU\n\nload\\_tensors: CPU\\_Mapped model buffer size = 166.92 MiB (just metadata)\n\nload\\_tensors: CUDA0 model buffer size = 12617.97 MiB\n\nload\\_tensors: CUDA1 model buffer size = 12206.31 MiB\n\nSo why was CPU going nuts? Nobody had the right answer.\n\n\n\nThe Fix - Two flags that nobody mentioned together:\n\nStep 1: Force ALL MoE experts off CPU\n\n\\--n-cpu-moe 0\n\nStart here. Systematically reduce from default down to 0. Each step helps. At 0 you still get CPU activity but it's better.\n\nStep 2: THIS IS THE KEY ONE\n\nChange from -sm row to:\n\n\\-sm layer\n\nRow-split (-sm row) splits each expert's weight matrix across both GPUs. This means every single expert call requires GPU-to-GPU communication over PCIe. For a model with 128 experts firing 8 per token, that's constant cross-GPU chatter killing your throughput.\n\nLayer-split (-sm layer) assigns complete layers/experts to one GPU. Each GPU owns its experts fully. No cross-GPU communication during routing. The GPUs work independently and efficiently.\n\nBOOM. 39 tokens/sec.\n\n\n\nThe Winning Command:\n\nllama-server.exe -m Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct-UD-IQ2\\_XXS.gguf -ngl 999 -c 4096 --port 8081 --n-cpu-moe 0 -t 6 -fa auto -sm layer\n\nResults:\n\n\n\nBefore: 6.5 t/s, CPU melting, GPUs doing nothing\n\nAfter: 38-39 t/s, CPUs chill, GPUs working properly\n\nThat's a 6x improvement with zero hardware changes\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy this works (the actual explanation):\n\nQwen3-Next uses a hybrid architecture — DeltaNet linear attention combined with high-sparsity MoE (128 experts, 8 active per token). When you row-split a MoE model across two GPUs, the expert weights are sliced horizontally across both cards. Every expert activation requires both GPUs to coordinate and combine results. With 8 experts firing per token across 47 layers, you're generating thousands of cross-GPU sync operations per token.\n\nLayer-split instead assigns whole layers to each GPU. Experts live entirely on one card. The routing decision sends the computation to whichever GPU owns that expert. Clean, fast, no sync overhead.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\nThe 166MB CPU\\_Mapped is normal — that's just mmap metadata and tokenizer, not model weights\n\n\\-t 6 sets CPU threads for the tiny bit of remaining CPU work\n\n\\-fa auto enables flash attention where supported\n\nThis is on llama.cpp b8077 — make sure you're on a recent build that has Qwen3-Next support (merged in b7186)\n\nModel fits in 32GB with \\~7GB headroom for KV cache\n\n\n\nHope this saves someone's sanity. Took me way too long to find this and I couldn't find it documented anywhere.\n\nIf this helped you, drop a comment — curious how it performs on other 50 series configurations.\n\n— RJ\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjlcntc1v0kg1.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ec6e0f9af2e3d3c6687f3167cef33f2335ec93d\n\n",

If you don't have a dedicated public IP address, but rather shared public IP address, you may be unfortunate enough to share the same IP address associated with suspicious online activities that would indicate automated scripts (also known as bot activities) and the first line of defense against that may just be enforced captcha. Some systems don't recognize individual devices, only IP addresses, so if there are multiple failed captcha solutions in a row, the system always resets and you have to try again which may seem to you as an individual that this captcha is broken because it denies you access even if you solve it correctly. The reason why is that at the same time there may be multiple other users from the same shared IP address trying to make the connection but failing the captcha at the same time which would overwhelm and confuse the protection layer so no matter what you're just not getting inside. This is pretty common with Tor connections or VPNs which are often associated with bots and hacking activities, but it may happen with regular connections as well.",
