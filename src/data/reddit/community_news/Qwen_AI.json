Training Dataset — Image-Related Questions\n\n1.1 Do training samples require **close-up facial images**?  \n1.2 Do training samples require **upper-body shots**?  \n1.3 Do training samples require **full-body images**?  \n1.4 Should the dataset include **various facial expressions** (crying, smiling, angry, etc.)?  \n1.5 Are **back-view images** required? (I can provide them)  \n1.6 Are **full 360-degree angle images** (top, bottom, left, right) required? (I can provide them)  \n1.7 Should the dataset include **various poses** (squatting, sitting, standing, running, jumping, etc.)? (I can provide them)  \n1.8 Should the dataset include **different outfits** (styles, colors, etc.)? (I can provide them)  \n1.9 Should the dataset include **different hairstyles** (long, short, various styles)? (I can provide them)  \n1.10 Should the dataset include **different solid-color backgrounds** (pure white, gray, black, etc.)? (I can provide them)  \n1.11 Should **hats be avoided** in the training dataset?  \n1.12 Are there any other important image-related recommendations?\n\n# 2.

Training Dataset — Video Sample Questions\n\n3.1 Are **video samples required** (e.g., a 360-degree rotation video of Annie)?  \n3.2 Are **video samples required** (e.g., a slow zoom-in / zoom-out shot of Annie)?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any clarification — **even answering just one of these questions would be extremely helpful**. 🙏\n\n\n\n# 中文\n\n**背景说明：**\n\n我计划为 **wan2.2 视频模型** 训练一个**角色 LoRA（安妮 / Annie）**，用于**动画制作，写实 3D 风格**。\n\n此前我从未训练过 LoRA，但今天我已经成功部署了 **DiffSynth-Studio**，并完成了一个官方示例的训练流程。  \n现在我希望正式开始我的**角色 LoRA 训练工作**，但在数据集构建与标注方面仍有许多疑问。\n\n我期望这个 **安妮 LoRA** 的使用方式类似于：\n\n>\n\n我希望生成结果中：\n\n* **安妮的外观始终正确、稳定**\n* **其他角色不会继承安妮的外观特征**\n\n# 一、训练数据集 —— 图片相关问题\n\n1.1 训练样本中是否**需要脸部特写**图片？  \n1.2 训练样本中是否**需要上半身**图片？  \n1.3 训练样本中是否**需要全身**图片？  \n1.4 是否需要包含**多种表情**（哭、笑、怒等）的图片？  \n1.5 是否需要**背面视角**图片？（我可以提供）  \n1.6 是否需要**上下左右 360° 全角度**图片？（我可以提供）  \n1.7 是否需要**多种姿势**（蹲、坐、站、跑、跳等）？（我可以提供）  \n1.8 是否需要**不同服装**（款式、颜色等）？（我可以提供）  \n1.9 是否需要**不同发型**（长、短、不同款式）？（我可以提供）  \n1.10 是否需要**不同纯色背景**（纯白、纯灰、纯黑等）？（我可以提供）  \n1.11 训练集中是否应**尽量避免帽子**？  \n1.12 是否还有其他重要的图片数据补充建议？\n\n# 二、训练数据集 —— 描述 / 标注（Caption）相关问题\n\n2.1 训练描述中是否应将**角色名（Annie）放在第一位**？  \n2.2 是否需要描述**五官细节**（眼睛、嘴巴、鼻子、脸型等）？  \n2.3 是否需要描述**镜头/视角**（远景、近景、左、右、俯视等）？  \n2.4 是否需要描述**表情**？  \n2.5 是否需要描述**姿势/动作**？  \n2.6 是否需要描述**服装**（款式、颜色等）？  \n2.7 如果发型是固定的，是否仍需要在描述中标注发型？  \n2.8 如果发型不固定，是否需要在描述中标注发型？  \n2.9 如果出现帽子，是否应在描述中明确标注？  \n2.10 是否需要描述**背景**（纯色或场景）？  \n2.11 是否需要明确标注**人物风格（写实 3D）**？  \n2.12 是否需要描述**性别**？  \n2.13 是否需要描述**年龄**？  \n2.14 是否需要描述**体型**？  \n2.15 是否还有其他重要的描述补充建议？  \n2.16 为了避免**其他角色继承安妮的外观**，是否需要在描述中**强化安妮的独有特征**？  \n（例如：只有安妮拥有红色头发）\n\n# 三、训练数据集 —— 视频样本相关问题\n\n3.1 是否需要**视频样本**（例如：围绕安妮 360° 旋转的视频）？  \n3.2 是否需要**视频样本**（例如：对安妮进行缓慢推近 / 拉远的镜头）？\n\n非常感谢任何形式的帮助，**哪怕只回答其中一项问题也非常感激** 🙏\n\n",

I'm using qwen-flash and qwen-plus in Singapore region for both realtime and batch inference.   \n  \nRealtime response times can go from anything like 50ms response time to 2 minutes for 2.5K context being sent.\n\nBatching with qwen-flash and qwen-plus also fails regularly with errors like ResponseTimeout despite the fact that my request tokens are way below the TPM limits.\n\nI have raised my issues with the customer support and they said it's probably due to their team fixing some scaling issues. This has been going on for 5 days now and I'm wondering is this normal and expected from Alibaba. In my view it's completely unreliable and I should probably move to alternative. \n\n",
