      "text": "This damn app and model keeps luring me back over and over. I find its responses to be very matter of fact and blunt. It frequently says \"I'm going to be honest here\" and proceeds to thoughtfully debate me.  I keep finding myself choosing Qwen first when I want to have general life chats, procedure building chats, Knowledge Graph suggestions, you name it.\n\nIt gives me a popup whenever it remembers something about me, or if it changes a previous memory. It also seems to know when to use memories at just the right time. \n\nThe MCP servers are wild, too. I have created projects in Qwen and have it dig through my KG and Obsidian Vault for project data. \n\nI really thought I would just be using Qwen as a toy for a few days and then move on to play with the next model, but the reverse happened. I'm kind of addicted to it. I know that I am freely volunteering my data to them but its really not that important to me for what I'm getting. \n\nIs anyone else surprised by Qwen's chatting abilities or have I just done drank the kool aid???

If you're worried about potential ban due to having your response flagged then no, I've never heard of anyone banned because of flagged outputs.\n\n\nA good rule of thumb is to disable thinking/reasoning and have your first message very mildly suggestive (I assume you're going for a sexually explicit theme here), then edit and re-roll the output. You'll quickly learn which words trigger the fail-safe and replace those words to imply what you're hinting at, most of the time it'll play along with a different phrasing. Sometimes re-rolling/editing with the same input will work within a couple of re-rolls. ",
