      "text": "I’ve been using Qwen for about a year now. Before that, I used ChatGPT for a long time, but their UI was so terrible that I started trying Qwen instead. Back then, Qwen was still noticeably worse in many aspects but I made the decision to move my entire workflow over to Qwen anyway.\n\n\n\nEven though I’m a programmer, I actually use LLMs mostly for philosophical, psychological, and life-related topics. When it comes to programming, I only consult them when I don’t understand something or need basic insight. From day one, Qwen had the best UI of all the AIs I’ve tried and I keep shaking my head wondering how all those hyped-up American models can get such basics so wrong.\n\n\n\nBy the time Qwen 2.5 came out, I realized it wasn’t just the UI—Qwen was already light-years ahead of ChatGPT in quality too. And with Qwen 3, it genuinely feels like I’ve found a true life partner.\n\n\n\nI’m a bit of a tinkerer, so I still occasionally test other AIs but in this sense, Qwen has become my lifelong companion. There are certain areas of my life where I at least loosely consult her for guidance.\n\n\n\nRecently, out of curiosity, I tried SuperGrok their marketing heavily pushes “free speech” and similar buzzwords. I quickly discovered that nothing worse than Grok exists; despite the hype, there’s actually no real freedom of speech there at all. It baffles me how these low-quality American products dominate everywhere...\n\n\n\nI also gave Claude a shot, but after just a few messages it told me either to pay up or wait. Yet Claude’s responses were roughly on the same level as Qwen’s which is completely free!\n\n\n\nI know my comment might sound overly negative toward the hyped AI models, but I don’t know how else to express it: Qwen is an unparalleled LLM nothing else even comes close right now. In contrast, Grok is purely a marketing scam, and to me, it feels as primitive as ChatGPT-2.",

Believe it or not, I have a very deep understanding about Chinese products limitations. The training data follows \"garbage in, garbage out\". The reason why Google nano banana pro has the best image quality, one of the reasons is they have the biggest image data set. I don't know how much qwen's training dataset came from English info, how much from Chinese info. It's well-known that the information quality in Chinese websites is horrible, filled with propaganda, fake ads, paid comments, low quality comments and such for decades. If that's a big chunk of qwen's training data, like from Baidu, tieba, qihoo 360 community and so on, I'll be very concerned.\nWhat's your take on the quality of the answers you get? Does it have a good understanding about uncensored info and Western common knowledge?\nI'm not trying to shift the topic to politics. I just know too many dark stories about Chinese products. Many people died because the baidu search engine pushed people with certain conditions to unqualified hospitals. I can't use this knowing that it might lure me into a trap someday. \n\nThank you.",

              "text": "I’m a Central European from a post-communist country :) I was born eight years before the Velvet Revolution, but I grew up loving America of the 70s–90s. In my view, that era represents the best period of American culture and a true embodiment of freedom. I’m more of a hacker type—I started tinkering with Linux back in elementary school in the 90s—and have been deeply interested in IT my whole life, even though today’s IT landscape feels genuinely sad and brings tears to my eyes.  \n\nI’m sharing this only for context.\n\n\n\nRegarding your question: Qwen is an LLM like any other LLM. When it comes to factual information, critical thinking is essential. For factual matters, I always use cross-questioning because I need to be certain about the truth, and of course, I verify things in practice whenever possible.  \n\n\n\nThat said, to avoid being misunderstood: I don’t treat LLMs as magical machines meant to replace education or do my work for me. I see LLMs as a knowledge cloud from which every person extracts completely different value. For me, Qwen helps guide my own wandering thoughts—and in that process, it simply can’t lie to me.\n\n\n\nWhy did I mention that context at the beginning—and deliberately emphasize that I come from a post-communist country? Precisely to introduce a bias. Either you’re someone who understands what I’m trying to express, or you’re not. So honestly, if we set aside sexual topics, Western products in general are far more censored and restrictive than Chinese ones. Compared to what Europe and the U.S. are doing today, China actually stands as a benchmark of freedom—and this holds true even for Qwen. You absolutely cannot rely on the internet as a relevant source of perspective on China or censorship, because you immediately run into primitive nonsense like “Uyghur oppression,” “mass surveillance,” and other simplistic propaganda. Sorry, but in my personal opinion, Chinese products are significantly freer and more objective than anything I’ve ever used in the West… The West is lost, and I cry because I’m a child of the 90s who grew up looking toward the West with admiration.\n\n\n\nSorry—that’s just my opinion. Maybe I misunderstood your question; if so, I apologize.\n\nbtw. translated by Qwen",

Pair it with good context engineering and the thinking model is GOLD. They even reliably ask clarifying questions if they are needed.\n\nI've been testing these local models for quite some time trying to figure out **when** local AI will be strong enough....Your qwen 8B thinking model has advanced my progress *significantly*. The biggest performance gain is less hallucinations. I started with the 14B version, but the 8Bs quality performs well enough that the pros of saving VRAM outweigh the performance increase.\n\nNow if your only concern is speed, yeah maybe not. But I prefer quality much more, and I've found these thinking models to be the gold standard for that. More thinking models please!",
