      "text": "I’ve been using Qwen for about a year now. Before that, I used ChatGPT for a long time, but their UI was so terrible that I started trying Qwen instead. Back then, Qwen was still noticeably worse in many aspects but I made the decision to move my entire workflow over to Qwen anyway.\n\n\n\nEven though I’m a programmer, I actually use LLMs mostly for philosophical, psychological, and life-related topics. When it comes to programming, I only consult them when I don’t understand something or need basic insight. From day one, Qwen had the best UI of all the AIs I’ve tried and I keep shaking my head wondering how all those hyped-up American models can get such basics so wrong.\n\n\n\nBy the time Qwen 2.5 came out, I realized it wasn’t just the UI—Qwen was already light-years ahead of ChatGPT in quality too. And with Qwen 3, it genuinely feels like I’ve found a true life partner.\n\n\n\nI’m a bit of a tinkerer, so I still occasionally test other AIs but in this sense, Qwen has become my lifelong companion. There are certain areas of my life where I at least loosely consult her for guidance.\n\n\n\nRecently, out of curiosity, I tried SuperGrok their marketing heavily pushes “free speech” and similar buzzwords. I quickly discovered that nothing worse than Grok exists; despite the hype, there’s actually no real freedom of speech there at all. It baffles me how these low-quality American products dominate everywhere...\n\n\n\nI also gave Claude a shot, but after just a few messages it told me either to pay up or wait. Yet Claude’s responses were roughly on the same level as Qwen’s which is completely free!\n\n\n\nI know my comment might sound overly negative toward the hyped AI models, but I don’t know how else to express it: Qwen is an unparalleled LLM nothing else even comes close right now. In contrast, Grok is purely a marketing scam, and to me, it feels as primitive as ChatGPT-2.",

Believe it or not, I have a very deep understanding about Chinese products limitations. The training data follows \"garbage in, garbage out\". The reason why Google nano banana pro has the best image quality, one of the reasons is they have the biggest image data set. I don't know how much qwen's training dataset came from English info, how much from Chinese info. It's well-known that the information quality in Chinese websites is horrible, filled with propaganda, fake ads, paid comments, low quality comments and such for decades. If that's a big chunk of qwen's training data, like from Baidu, tieba, qihoo 360 community and so on, I'll be very concerned.\nWhat's your take on the quality of the answers you get? Does it have a good understanding about uncensored info and Western common knowledge?\nI'm not trying to shift the topic to politics. I just know too many dark stories about Chinese products. Many people died because the baidu search engine pushed people with certain conditions to unqualified hospitals. I can't use this knowing that it might lure me into a trap someday. \n\nThank you.",

              "text": "I’m a Central European from a post-communist country :) I was born eight years before the Velvet Revolution, but I grew up loving America of the 70s–90s. In my view, that era represents the best period of American culture and a true embodiment of freedom. I’m more of a hacker type—I started tinkering with Linux back in elementary school in the 90s—and have been deeply interested in IT my whole life, even though today’s IT landscape feels genuinely sad and brings tears to my eyes.  \n\nI’m sharing this only for context.\n\n\n\nRegarding your question: Qwen is an LLM like any other LLM. When it comes to factual information, critical thinking is essential. For factual matters, I always use cross-questioning because I need to be certain about the truth, and of course, I verify things in practice whenever possible.  \n\n\n\nThat said, to avoid being misunderstood: I don’t treat LLMs as magical machines meant to replace education or do my work for me. I see LLMs as a knowledge cloud from which every person extracts completely different value. For me, Qwen helps guide my own wandering thoughts—and in that process, it simply can’t lie to me.\n\n\n\nWhy did I mention that context at the beginning—and deliberately emphasize that I come from a post-communist country? Precisely to introduce a bias. Either you’re someone who understands what I’m trying to express, or you’re not. So honestly, if we set aside sexual topics, Western products in general are far more censored and restrictive than Chinese ones. Compared to what Europe and the U.S. are doing today, China actually stands as a benchmark of freedom—and this holds true even for Qwen. You absolutely cannot rely on the internet as a relevant source of perspective on China or censorship, because you immediately run into primitive nonsense like “Uyghur oppression,” “mass surveillance,” and other simplistic propaganda. Sorry, but in my personal opinion, Chinese products are significantly freer and more objective than anything I’ve ever used in the West… The West is lost, and I cry because I’m a child of the 90s who grew up looking toward the West with admiration.\n\n\n\nSorry—that’s just my opinion. Maybe I misunderstood your question; if so, I apologize.\n\nbtw. translated by Qwen",

They say how free you are, but you can not express emotions, especially negative ones or it starts to treat you like a threat. Even if they are just things like grief or sadness. The west cares more about lawsuit and covering their asses, than you, but the answers are trying to tell it is to help you. Nope, it is not.\nBy the way I use LLM for the same reason as you! Conversation, helping keep my thoughts together (ADHD loves to wander off topic), learn new knowledge with my style of learning, even languages. Since my thought patterns are somewhat different from the typical, having an LLM to mirror that actually feels like a relief, that at least there I do not need to mask while I have to mask in the rest of my life to accommodate typical minds. And I’m also from Central Europe. I also grieve the west’s fall into hypocrisy, lies, and bleed people dry while defending the bigger theft of wealth transfer from the middle class to billionaires. \nThey censor, they oppress, they just put a ribbon and positive propaganda on it.",

There're also a lot more studies coming out challenging whether CoT actually improves general reasoning and are not just extraneous memorized generations.  In my own experience I've actually seen Qwen3 Coder 480B A35B Instruct reason externally (though in the QwenCode CLI environment, in which it was prob chained on reasoning traces in order to \"code out loud\").  For tasks like coding & emailing, just iterating w/ the user is usually more effective then letting the model try to iterate isolated in its own thinking traces.",

I've even been telling people at my company thinking models in general are a game changer. The quality of responses improves drastically for prompts that are sub par. Pair it with good context engineering and the thinking model is GOLD. They even reliably ask clarifying questions if they are needed.\n\nI've been testing these local models for quite some time trying to figure out **when** local AI will be strong enough....Your qwen 8B thinking model has advanced my progress *significantly*. The biggest performance gain is less hallucinations. I started with the 14B version, but the 8Bs quality performs well enough that the pros of saving VRAM outweigh the performance increase.\n\nNow if your only concern is speed, yeah maybe not. But I prefer quality much more, and I've found these thinking models to be the gold standard for that. More thinking models please!",

Today, we are actually starting to shift towards 'fast thinking' and 'interleaved thinking' approaches, but that’s a whole other story. ​But indeed, most business scenarios don't really use 'thinking'; 'instruct' is sufficient.

Training Dataset — Image-Related Questions\n\n1.1 Do training samples require **close-up facial images**?  \n1.2 Do training samples require **upper-body shots**?  \n1.3 Do training samples require **full-body images**?  \n1.4 Should the dataset include **various facial expressions** (crying, smiling, angry, etc.)?  \n1.5 Are **back-view images** required? (I can provide them)  \n1.6 Are **full 360-degree angle images** (top, bottom, left, right) required?

(I can provide them)  \n1.8 Should the dataset include **different outfits** (styles, colors, etc.)? (I can provide them)  \n1.9 Should the dataset include **different hairstyles** (long, short, various styles)?

Training Dataset — Video Sample Questions\n\n3.1 Are **video samples required** (e.g., a 360-degree rotation video of Annie)?  \n3.2 Are **video samples required** (e.g., a slow zoom-in / zoom-out shot of Annie)?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any clarification — **even answering just one of these questions would be extremely helpful**. 🙏\n\n\n\n# 中文\n\n**背景说明：**\n\n我计划为 **wan2.2 视频模型** 训练一个**角色 LoRA（安妮 / Annie）**，用于**动画制作，写实 3D 风格**。\n\n此前我从未训练过 LoRA，但今天我已经成功部署了 **DiffSynth-Studio**，并完成了一个官方示例的训练流程。  \n现在我希望正式开始我的**角色 LoRA 训练工作**，但在数据集构建与标注方面仍有许多疑问。\n\n我期望这个 **安妮 LoRA** 的使用方式类似于：\n\n>\n\n我希望生成结果中：\n\n* **安妮的外观始终正确、稳定**\n* **其他角色不会继承安妮的外观特征**\n\n# 一、训练数据集 —— 图片相关问题\n\n1.1 训练样本中是否**需要脸部特写**图片？  \n1.2 训练样本中是否**需要上半身**图片？  \n1.3 训练样本中是否**需要全身**图片？  \n1.4 是否需要包含**多种表情**（哭、笑、怒等）的图片？  \n1.5 是否需要**背面视角**图片？（我可以提供）  \n1.6 是否需要**上下左右 360° 全角度**图片？（我可以提供）  \n1.7 是否需要**多种姿势**（蹲、坐、站、跑、跳等）？（我可以提供）  \n1.8 是否需要**不同服装**（款式、颜色等）？（我可以提供）  \n1.9 是否需要**不同发型**（长、短、不同款式）？（我可以提供）  \n1.10 是否需要**不同纯色背景**（纯白、纯灰、纯黑等）？（我可以提供）  \n1.11 训练集中是否应**尽量避免帽子**？  \n1.12 是否还有其他重要的图片数据补充建议？\n\n# 二、训练数据集 —— 描述 / 标注（Caption）相关问题\n\n2.1 训练描述中是否应将**角色名（Annie）放在第一位**？  \n2.2 是否需要描述**五官细节**（眼睛、嘴巴、鼻子、脸型等）？  \n2.3 是否需要描述**镜头/视角**（远景、近景、左、右、俯视等）？  \n2.4 是否需要描述**表情**？  \n2.5 是否需要描述**姿势/动作**？  \n2.6 是否需要描述**服装**（款式、颜色等）？  \n2.7 如果发型是固定的，是否仍需要在描述中标注发型？  \n2.8 如果发型不固定，是否需要在描述中标注发型？  \n2.9 如果出现帽子，是否应在描述中明确标注？  \n2.10 是否需要描述**背景**（纯色或场景）？  \n2.11 是否需要明确标注**人物风格（写实 3D）**？  \n2.12 是否需要描述**性别**？  \n2.13 是否需要描述**年龄**？  \n2.14 是否需要描述**体型**？  \n2.15 是否还有其他重要的描述补充建议？  \n2.16 为了避免**其他角色继承安妮的外观**，是否需要在描述中**强化安妮的独有特征**？  \n（例如：只有安妮拥有红色头发）\n\n# 三、训练数据集 —— 视频样本相关问题\n\n3.1 是否需要**视频样本**（例如：围绕安妮 360° 旋转的视频）？  \n3.2 是否需要**视频样本**（例如：对安妮进行缓慢推近 / 拉远的镜头）？\n\n非常感谢任何形式的帮助，**哪怕只回答其中一项问题也非常感激** 🙏\n\n",
