This is not a prototype — deliver a functional, tested implementation.\nINPUT SPECIFICATION:\nImplement a unified system incorporating:  \n\n    Layered architecture (persistence → logic → integration → interface)  \n    Core engine with workflow orchestration  \n    Selected standard modules from the list above  \n    Error resilience and recovery mechanisms\n\nMANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION RULES:  \n\n    ZERO PLACEHOLDERS: No # TODO, pass, stubs, or incomplete logic. Every function must contain executable code.  \n    FULL DOCUMENTATION:  \n        Type hints on all parameters and returns  \n        Docstrings (Google style) for all public classes/methods  \n        Inline comments explaining non-obvious logic  \n        Embedded test cases in if __name__ == \"__main__\" blocks\n    DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING:  \n        Validate all external inputs  \n        Catch and log recoverable errors  \n        Fail gracefully on unrecoverable conditions\n    MODULAR DELIVERY: Output one logical module/file per response. Maintain dependency order.\n\nDELIVERY PROTOCOL:\nWork in sequential PHASES due to output limits:  \n\n    PHASE 1: Project structure, dependencies (requirements.txt), configuration system  \n    PHASE 2: Core engine and persistence layer  \n    PHASE 3+: Additional modules per priority\n\nCONTINUITY RULE:\nTerminate output cleanly at phase boundaries or token limits. Await explicit \"PROCEED TO NEXT PHASE\" before continuing. Never summarize previous output.\nBEGIN: Start with PHASE 1 — output only the directory tree and requirements.txt.\n\n\n\nUsage Instructions\n\n    Replace [SYSTEM_NAME] with your project identifier  \n    Set [LINE_COUNT] to your target (e.g., 10000)  \n    Select 3–5 modules from the \"Standard Infrastructure Modules\" list matching your scope  \n    Optionally adjust layers/architecture to fit your domain.",

There is a recent update to the dense Qwen3 32B, it's Qwen3 32B VL, which exists as separate Instruct and Thinking versions and claims better performance as pure text too. Kudos u/[Due-Project-7507](https://www.reddit.com/user/Due-Project-7507/) \n\nSo I'm doing a distill of a different model (not Qwen) and needed LLM-based filtering for a mass generation result. I'm camping on a Vast A100 40Gb, so wanted something running there. Qwen3 30B A3B 2507 fit comfortably in AWQ4 vllm and minimally in 8bit llama.cpp but was Just Wrong at the task. Qwen3 80B A3B fits only in IQ3 llama.cpp, but, while better than the 30B, wasn't really great at this classification even on a cloud subscription.\n\nThen I found Qwen3 32B, which in AWQ4, on vllm, is doing a stellar job and is also blazing fast on the hardware.\n\nSo question: why is there not much discussion on this hidden gem of a model and why was there no 2507 power-up for it? Okay, for compute-limited applications (as in \"the edge\") the MoE speedup makes all the difference. But when one is memory-limited more than compute-limited, the \"extra smart\" of a 32B dense model without the massive memory requirements of 80/235B MoEs is quite formidable.",
