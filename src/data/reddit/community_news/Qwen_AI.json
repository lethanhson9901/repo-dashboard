Price is 1250 EUR, the bargain in this speed category. Also, Spark is not capable of using full 200G bandwidth so I guess with a right splitter cable, this switch will do 8 Sparks easily (AFAIK, not going to test it likely).\n\nI run primarily vllm but also TensorRT-LLM, in the beginning I used Ollama but you cannot make a cluster from it (yet). I run everything within a Docker container, that's my rule.  \n  \nFor vllm & cluster setup, I use [https://github.com/eugr/spark-vllm-docker](https://github.com/eugr/spark-vllm-docker) \\- the repo people/guy respond to changes in vllm very quickly.

      "text": "Been hunting for a local daily driver to finally drop paid APIs, and I think I found \"The One.\"\n\nGrabbed the new **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-4bit**, and at first, it was rough. I was getting those classic 4-bit issues: reasoning loops, endless \"Wait, let me check...\" spirals, and failing simple logic traps like the \"Car Wash\" problem.\n\nSpent the day stress-testing it against the [Digital Spaceport Benchmark suite](https://digitalspaceport.com/about/testing-local-llms/) (logic, math, SVG coding, counting). It was hit-or-miss until I realized the model wasn't \"dumb\" it just needed structure. The quantization makes it anxious, so it second-guesses itself into oblivion.\n\n**The Fix:**\n\nTweak the system prompt to force \"Adaptive Logic.\" It separates the scratchpad thinking from the final answer and sets a hard limit on the \"thinking\" phase.\n\nOnce applied this, it passed **100% of the tests** in seconds.\n\n* **Logic:** Solved the \"Pico de Gato\" schedule puzzle perfectly.\n* **Math:** Nailed the \"Two Drivers\" problem without looping.\n* **Coding:** Generated a clean SVG cat on the first try.\n* **Counting:** Actually counted \"Peppermint\" correctly (rare for 4-bit).\n\nNext up, I'm throwing my complex n8n workflows at it to see if it survives. 🤞\n\nIf you're struggling with the 4-bit version, here is the config that unlocked it for me.\n\n**⚙️ The Config**\n\n* **Model:** Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-4bit\n* **Temp:** 0.7 | **Top P:** 0.9 | **Min P:** 0.05 *(Critical!)*\n* **Freq Penalty:** 1.1 | **Repeat Last N:** 64\n\n**🧠 The \"Anti-Loop\" System Prompt**\n\n*(Paste into OpenWebUI/LM Studio)*\n\nPlaintext\n\n    You are a helpful and efficient AI assistant. Your goal is to provide accurate answers without getting stuck in repetitive loops.\n    \n    1. PROCESS: Before generating your final response, you must analyze the request inside <thinking> tags.\n    2. ADAPTIVE LOGIC:\n       - For COMPLEX tasks (logic, math, coding): Briefly plan your approach in NO MORE than 3 steps inside the tags. (Save the detailed execution/work for the final answer).\n       - For CHALLENGES: If the user doubts you or asks you to \"check online,\" DO NOT LOOP. Do one quick internal check, then immediately state your answer.\n       - For SIMPLE tasks: Keep the <thinking> section extremely concise (1 sentence).\n    3. OUTPUT: Once your analysis is complete, close the tag with </thinking>. Then, start a new line with exactly \"### FINAL ANSWER:\" followed by your response.\n    \n    DO NOT reveal your thinking process outside of the tags.\n\nBig love to the Qwen team. You guys genuinely changed the game with this one. Having this running locally is a dream. 🚀",

When I told it (as I normally would with, e.g. Gemini) \"it fails with an error on line 49\" it got weirdly defensive and said I need to upgrade to a modern operating system that supports bitwise operators... completely missing the real problem entirely. Eventually on the seventh try it was like \"I'm sorry, CalculateParallelogramArea() doesn't exist, I hallucinated that. Here's a corrected script that will actually work.\" And in its defense, it did.",

          "text": "I have been using qwen3-coder-next since launch (tested quants Q3KXL to Q8, chose to stay with Q6KXL) and yesterday I tested the 122b, the thing is I only tested it in Q4KXL and since the model has just launched it is possible that its output is not yet fully operational in the current llama.cpp engine (same thing happened with qwen3-coder-next at launch)\n\nSo, given all this considerations, at this moment, the 122b is falling behind big time in coding against the qwen3-coder-next for the coding tests I have done.\n\nOne very simple example is a test I do asking them to create a pygame of chrome dinosaur, and 122b made multiple mistakes before getting 100% working game, while qwen3-coder-next even in Q3 was one shoting it with good quality SVG, collision, birds, cactus, etc. The Q6 never missed it in one-shot and makes very good quality SVG and game dynamics. The 122b after a number of attempts created a 'ugly' version of the game.\n\nAnyhow, the most likely answer to your question at this point is: it is too soon to know which one will perform better.\n\nNot to mention that the two models have different purpose, so ideally you should leverage each one in its better performing scenario.",

The free access is ongoing with no expiry, as long as you use it for dev/prototyping (not for serving real users in production).\n\nThe commonly reported rate limit is around **40 requests/minute**, though NVIDIA doesn't publish exact per-model limits and has confirmed they don't plan to. For a coding session that's rarely an issue.\n\nThe real pain point is that popular models especially the S+ tier ones like DeepSeek V3.2 or Qwen3 Coder 480B can be slow or outright overloaded 🔥 during peak hours. That's actually the main reason I built this tool: instead of guessing, you see all 44 models' live latency and uptime at once and switch in one keystroke.",
