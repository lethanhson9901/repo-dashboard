      "text": "**Turn any book into an audiobook with AI voice synthesis!**\nI just released an open-source tool that converts PDFs, EPUBs, DOCX, and TXT files into high-quality audiobooks using **Qwen3 TTS** - the amazing open-source voice model that just went public.\n## What it does:\n**Converts any document format** (PDF, EPUB, DOCX, DOC, TXT) into audiobooks  \n**Two voice modes**: Pre-built speakers (Ryan, Serena, etc.) or clone any voice from a reference audio  \n**Always uses 1.7B model** for best quality  \n**Smart chunking** with sentence boundary detection  \n**Intelligent caching** to avoid re-processing  \n**Auto cleanup** of temporary files  \n## Key Features:\n- **Custom Voice Mode**: Professional narrators optimized for audiobook reading\n- **Voice Clone Mode**: Automatically transcribes reference audio and clones the voice\n- **Multi-format support**: Works with PDFs, EPUBs, Word docs, and plain text\n- **Sequential processing**: Ensures chunks are combined in correct order\n- **Progress tracking**: Real-time updates with time estimates\n## Quick Start:\nInstall Qwen3 TTS (one-click install with Pinokio)\nInstall Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\nPlace your books in `book_to_convert/` folder\nRun: `python audiobook_converter.py`\nGet your audiobook from `audiobooks/` folder!\n## Voice Cloning Example:\n```bash\npython audiobook_converter.py --voice-clone --voice-sample reference.wav\n```\nThe tool automatically transcribes your reference audio - no manual text input needed!\n## Why I built this:\nI was frustrated with expensive audiobook services and wanted a free, open-source solution. Qwen3 TTS going open-source was perfect timing - the voice quality is incredible and it handles both generic speech and voice cloning really well.\n## Performance:\n- Processing speed: ~4-5 minutes per chunk (1.7B model) it is a little slow im working on it\n- Quality: High-quality audio suitable for audiobooks\n- Output: MP3 format, configurable bitrate\n## GitHub:\n🔗 **https://github.com/WhiskeyCoder/Qwen3-Audiobook-Converter**\n**What do you think?** Have you tried Qwen3 TTS? What would you use this for?",

I'm using qwen-flash and qwen-plus in Singapore region for both realtime and batch inference.   \n  \nRealtime response times can go from anything like 50ms response time to 2 minutes for 2.5K context being sent.\n\nBatching with qwen-flash and qwen-plus also fails regularly with errors like ResponseTimeout despite the fact that my request tokens are way below the TPM limits.\n\nI have raised my issues with the customer support and they said it's probably due to their team fixing some scaling issues. This has been going on for 5 days now and I'm wondering is this normal and expected from Alibaba. In my view it's completely unreliable and I should probably move to alternative. \n\n",
