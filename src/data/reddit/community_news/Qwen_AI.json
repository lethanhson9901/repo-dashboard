I do work at events and brand activations, I do a lot of stuff with photo, so I've been working heavy with ai applied to it, but more in a conventional way, passing a prompt, calling a model, providing an input image and no more than that. Related to this, I created an app that is a coloring book creator, user choose a preset theme or can describe a personalized one, writes his/her name and takes a photo. System returns a cover page with the name of the user, the amount of pages selected with illustrations of the theme selected or described and his/her photo converted to outline so it can be colored by them too.   \nHow this can benefit me compared to using gemini or flux?

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a long-time reader and AI enthusiast. I've used all the available TTS options, but nothing really stuck out to me, so I decided to make my own.\n\n**Introducing: Alexandria.** It’s a free, open-source audio book generator for creating audio versions of fiction or books locally on your own computer.\n\n**AUDIO SAMPLE:** [https://vocaroo.com/1cG82gVS61hn](https://vocaroo.com/1cG82gVS61hn) (Sion LoRA, comes built-in)\n\n# What it does:\n\n* **Automatic Scripting:** An LLM reads your text and automatically splits it into a script, identifying speakers, dialogue, and narration, while writing vocal directions for each line.\n* **Local TTS Engine:** Uses **Qwen3-TTS 1.7B** to generate audio with per-line emotion and delivery control. No character limits or subscription fees.\n* **Character Management:** Assign individual voices to every character in your story.\n\n# Advanced Voice System (5 Types):\n\n* **Custom:** 9 built-in voices with instruct control (emotion, tone, pacing).\n* **Clone:** Clone any voice from a short reference audio clip.\n* **LoRA:** Train a persistent custom voice identity from \\~15-60 samples (includes the training pipeline).\n* **Voice Design:** Describe a voice in plain text (*\"A gravelly old man with a dry wit\"*) and generate it on the fly.\n* **Saved Design:** Save your created voices to keep them consistent across a long series.\n\n# The Editor & Export:\n\n* **Fine-Grained Control:** Review and edit every line. Regenerate individual lines with different seeds, voices, or instructions.\n* **Directives:** Tell the TTS exactly how to deliver a line (e.g., *\"Cold fury, dangerously quiet\"* or *\"Exhausted, barely holding it together\"*).\n* **Flexible Export:** Export as a single MP3 or as a **per-speaker Audacity project** (separate tracks for each character with labels).\n\n**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/Finrandojin/alexandria-audiobook](https://github.com/Finrandojin/alexandria-audiobook)\n\nI’m really looking for feedback from users on this, specifically if there are features (like better handling of markdown or specific web-novel formatting) that would make it more useful.",

For example, the first part of the video could be very convincing, and without studying it closely, would pass most people's initial watch of the video as \"real,\" but the second part, 0:29+, the transition is so fast and unnatural into the car, it breaks the immersion.  The visual quality is amazing, but the immersion and motion quickly diminish the moment she lifts off the side of the car.  In this situation, is it simply a matter of recording hundreds of videos of people leaning against cars and then entering their vehicles? Or will this always be a fundamental issue for acts we don't have video/image data on? \n\nI have to assume the real-world nuances will always be skewed for AI until we have enough compute and data to feed image and video models all the small nuances of how things work visually.  At that point, I am sure we would need a system/model that can train on petabytes of data, and essentially images and videos of nearly every scenario that happens in the real world, for things to become fully immersive.\n\nThe reason I ask is because, I believe a digital world like the movie \"Ready Player One\" would be possible once AI allows for dynamic creations of these types of \"New Worlds\" .\n\n  ",

      "text": "Hey everyone! I just published a blog post breaking down the architecture and benchmarks behind **qwen3-asr-swift**, an open-source Swift package that brings Qwen3's speech models to Apple Silicon natively using MLX Swift.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **ASR (Speech-to-Text):** Qwen3-ASR running on-device with \\~100ms time-to-first-token and RTF of 0.064 — supports 52 languages (30 major + 22 Chinese dialects)\n* **TTS (Text-to-Speech):** Qwen3-TTS generating natural, expressive speech faster than real-time (RTF < 1.0)\n* Runs entirely on Mac (M1–M4) and iOS — no cloud, no API keys\n\n**Why I built it:** There was no native Swift implementation of Qwen3 speech models. The Python/MLX ecosystem had `mlx-audio`, but if you wanted to integrate ASR or TTS into a Swift app, you were out of luck. This package gives you a clean Swift API with SPM support.\n\n**Quick taste of the API:**\n\nswift\n\n    import Qwen3ASR\n    let model = try await Qwen3ASRModel.fromPretrained()\n    let text = model.transcribe(audio: samples, sampleRate: 16000)\n\n**Key benchmarks (M3 Max):**\n\n* Qwen3-ASR-0.6B: WER 2.11% on LibriSpeech clean — and crucially, 17.88% in noisy conditions vs Whisper's 63.17%\n* Qwen3-ASR-1.7B: even better at 1.63% WER clean\n\nThe blog post dives into the full encoder-decoder architecture, mel spectrogram pipeline, how the audio encoder and Qwen3 text decoder are wired together, and real-world performance numbers.\n\n📖 Blog post: [https://blog.ivan.digital/qwen3-asr-swift-on-device-asr-tts-for-apple-silicon-architecture-and-benchmarks-27cbf1e4463f](https://blog.ivan.digital/qwen3-asr-swift-on-device-asr-tts-for-apple-silicon-architecture-and-benchmarks-27cbf1e4463f)\n\n💻 GitHub: [https://github.com/ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift](https://github.com/ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift)\n\nLicensed Apache 2.0.

For agent loops and interactive coding, that speed compounds fast.\n\n# Best price for always-on agent\n\nAt $0.3/M input tokens, $1.2/M output tokens, $0.06/M prompt caching read tokens, $0.375/M prompt caching write tokens, M2.5 is purpose-built for high-volume, always-on production workloads.",
