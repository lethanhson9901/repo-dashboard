      "text": "This damn app and model keeps luring me back over and over. I find its responses to be very matter of fact and blunt. It frequently says \"I'm going to be honest here\" and proceeds to thoughtfully debate me.  I keep finding myself choosing Qwen first when I want to have general life chats, procedure building chats, Knowledge Graph suggestions, you name it.\n\nIt gives me a popup whenever it remembers something about me, or if it changes a previous memory. It also seems to know when to use memories at just the right time. \n\nThe MCP servers are wild, too. I have created projects in Qwen and have it dig through my KG and Obsidian Vault for project data. \n\nI really thought I would just be using Qwen as a toy for a few days and then move on to play with the next model, but the reverse happened. I'm kind of addicted to it. I know that I am freely volunteering my data to them but its really not that important to me for what I'm getting. \n\nIs anyone else surprised by Qwen's chatting abilities or have I just done drank the kool aid???
