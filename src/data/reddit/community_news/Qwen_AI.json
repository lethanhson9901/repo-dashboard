Server, mobile app, telegram transport - this kind of stuff.  \nOne Of the skills I've made for this agent is \"self config\" - it technically can do a brain surgery on his own brain (system prompt,  config) , add tools ( mcp config and download) and has access to catalog with his own skills.  \n \n\nYesterday I pointed Qween to skill on how to write skills online, then showed it documentation of qween image generation and edition and ordered it to write a new skill.   \nIt took him a while, but qween wrote [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md) plus bunch of python scripts to make the usage easy. I ordered it to keep api SDK in his memory and recall it when needed so no hardcoded values.   \nFirst iteration was successful! it took him a while, but in new chat he DID used the skill, he did created the picture and embedded it in chat! ( I'm using MD rendering ) \n\nIt had a couple of bumps, so i asked it to improve the skill - now it works ok after 2 iterations!  \n\n\nit is amazing how the agent improved itself!   \n( plus i'm happy with qween image generation and edit ) \n\n  \nWhat is your  experience with that",

You'll quickly learn which words trigger the fail-safe and replace those words to imply what you're hinting at, most of the time it'll play along with a different phrasing. Sometimes re-rolling/editing with the same input will work within a couple of re-rolls. ",

[Here is the paper](https://zenodo.org/records/18305825) I wrote on it. I would love any comments or thoughts on this.\n\n**Highlights**: This paper introduces Guardrail-Centric Fine-Tuning, a novel paradigm for safely deploying large language models (LLMs) in deterministic, constraint-heavy operational decision systems, using inventory replenishment in a distribution environment as a practical testbed. Rather than fine-tuning models on item-specific outcomes—which often leads to brittle generalization, loss of reasoning capability, and silent failures—the approach aligns a quantized Qwen2.5-Coder-14B model to approximately fifty generalized, domain-agnostic behavioural guardrails that enforce strict reasoning boundaries, constraint hierarchies, and audit requirements. Paired with a deterministic Python enforcement layer handling all numerical calculations and hard rules, this hybrid architecture separates probabilistic reasoning from exact execution, yielding stable, explainable, and auditable ordering recommendations across diverse product catalogs. Empirical results demonstrate enhanced robustness, preservation of general capabilities, and elimination of common fine-tuning pitfalls (such as trigger-target confusion or degraded states), underscoring that constraining how models reason—rather than dictating what outcomes they produce—is a more reliable strategy for enterprise-grade AI deployment in high-stakes domains like supply chain management.",

Now when you try to do image to image with the \"create image\" option, it produces bad results because it doesn't respect the original image proportions, the saturation level is not right, and it doesn't follow your prompt exactly, changing all kinds of other things you didn't ask for.\n\nIn essence, it's creating a new version of the original image instead of editing exactly what you need. That's why we need the \"image edit\" feature back. Why did the devs remove it?\n\nI saw other people on this subreddit and on their Discord and even in their Github complain about it [https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen/issues/2064](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen/issues/2064) It was working flawlessly before. Please bring image edit back.\n\nEdit: Ever since Qwen-Image-2.0 came out literally right after I made this post, it seems the issue is somewhat fixed after a bit of testing. They combined the image edit and image create features into one package and released it today. Sometimes you will have to specify in your prompt to \"maintain original proportions\" of the image and to not change anything else. But overall it seems to be working.",
