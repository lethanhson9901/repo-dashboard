Server, mobile app, telegram transport - this kind of stuff.  \nOne Of the skills I've made for this agent is \"self config\" - it technically can do a brain surgery on his own brain (system prompt,  config) , add tools ( mcp config and download) and has access to catalog with his own skills.  \n \n\nYesterday I pointed Qween to skill on how to write skills online, then showed it documentation of qween image generation and edition and ordered it to write a new skill.   \nIt took him a while, but qween wrote [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md) plus bunch of python scripts to make the usage easy. I ordered it to keep api SDK in his memory and recall it when needed so no hardcoded values.   \nFirst iteration was successful! it took him a while, but in new chat he DID used the skill, he did created the picture and embedded it in chat! ( I'm using MD rendering ) \n\nIt had a couple of bumps, so i asked it to improve the skill - now it works ok after 2 iterations!  \n\n\nit is amazing how the agent improved itself!   \n( plus i'm happy with qween image generation and edit ) \n\n  \nWhat is your  experience with that",

If you're worried about potential ban due to having your response flagged then no, I've never heard of anyone banned because of flagged outputs.\n\n\nA good rule of thumb is to disable thinking/reasoning and have your first message very mildly suggestive (I assume you're going for a sexually explicit theme here), then edit and re-roll the output. You'll quickly learn which words trigger the fail-safe and replace those words to imply what you're hinting at, most of the time it'll play along with a different phrasing. Sometimes re-rolling/editing with the same input will work within a couple of re-rolls. ",

[Here is the paper](https://zenodo.org/records/18305825) I wrote on it. I would love any comments or thoughts on this.\n\n**Highlights**: This paper introduces Guardrail-Centric Fine-Tuning, a novel paradigm for safely deploying large language models (LLMs) in deterministic, constraint-heavy operational decision systems, using inventory replenishment in a distribution environment as a practical testbed. Rather than fine-tuning models on item-specific outcomes—which often leads to brittle generalization, loss of reasoning capability, and silent failures—the approach aligns a quantized Qwen2.5-Coder-14B model to approximately fifty generalized, domain-agnostic behavioural guardrails that enforce strict reasoning boundaries, constraint hierarchies, and audit requirements. Paired with a deterministic Python enforcement layer handling all numerical calculations and hard rules, this hybrid architecture separates probabilistic reasoning from exact execution, yielding stable, explainable, and auditable ordering recommendations across diverse product catalogs. Empirical results demonstrate enhanced robustness, preservation of general capabilities, and elimination of common fine-tuning pitfalls (such as trigger-target confusion or degraded states), underscoring that constraining how models reason—rather than dictating what outcomes they produce—is a more reliable strategy for enterprise-grade AI deployment in high-stakes domains like supply chain management.",
