I am working on a 250,000 line SaaS project right now and working largely with Codex 5.3 X high, Opus 4.6 and have used GLM 5 and Kimi 2.5 for reviewing and comparison work. \n\nI had would should have been a simple issue with fly our menus from a compacted side menu, only one worked. Codex had 3 attempts and failed so aftr 3 attempts I would switch to Opus and usually the 'fresh eyes' fix it right away (happens if the issues appears on Opus 4.6 and then introduce codex, it fixes it right away). However, on this occasion both failed after 3 attempts. As it had recently been installed, I asked Qwen to take a look. I explained in the prompt (as I had to Opus) that lateral thinking was required, it the issue was as it first appeared, Codex would have fixed it. \n\n\n\nBoth codex and Opus had suggested the same fault and were looking in that area. Qwen suggested something different, extracted and presented small pieces of code to explain why why there was and issue and how to fix it. Additionally, it pointed out several areas where the code could be improved (a module per pop-out menu was being used, it suggested use one to suit all. simple stuff but neither opus nor codex suggested this.\n\nthe fix worked first time so was exactly as Qwen had suggested and not as either opus or codex had considered \n\n**Optimisation for benchmarking?**\n\nWhilst on Qwen is up there but not topping the charts and having used Qwen to further optimise this project by reducing resource usage on server monitoring by 50%, it got me thinking. in another world of mine I design and optimise high performance directional antennas. These are compared with others on a standard computer model comparison bench. I have optimised models in the past to fair well on benchmarks even though in the real-world applications, a deviance from the bench optimisation shows better results. \n\nPerhaps it is worth trying qwen on your own projects and take a leap of faith. it might be Qwen engineers just haven't worked out how best to 'cheat' the benchmarks yet or perhaps, they just don't want to. \n\nNot read back no edited with AI. However, I am sure you guessed that :-)\n\n\n\n",

I've used all the available TTS options, but nothing really stuck out to me, so I decided to make my own.\n\n**Introducing: Alexandria.** It’s a free, open-source audio book generator for creating audio versions of fiction or books locally on your own computer.\n\n**AUDIO SAMPLE:** [https://vocaroo.com/1cG82gVS61hn](https://vocaroo.com/1cG82gVS61hn) (Sion LoRA, comes built-in)\n\n# What it does:\n\n* **Automatic Scripting:** An LLM reads your text and automatically splits it into a script, identifying speakers, dialogue, and narration, while writing vocal directions for each line.\n* **Local TTS Engine:** Uses **Qwen3-TTS 1.7B** to generate audio with per-line emotion and delivery control. No character limits or subscription fees.\n* **Character Management:** Assign individual voices to every character in your story.\n\n# Advanced Voice System (5 Types):\n\n* **Custom:** 9 built-in voices with instruct control (emotion, tone, pacing).\n* **Clone:** Clone any voice from a short reference audio clip.\n* **LoRA:** Train a persistent custom voice identity from \\~15-60 samples (includes the training pipeline).\n* **Voice Design:** Describe a voice in plain text (*\"A gravelly old man with a dry wit\"*) and generate it on the fly.\n* **Saved Design:** Save your created voices to keep them consistent across a long series.\n\n# The Editor & Export:\n\n* **Fine-Grained Control:** Review and edit every line. Regenerate individual lines with different seeds, voices, or instructions.\n* **Directives:** Tell the TTS exactly how to deliver a line (e.g., *\"Cold fury, dangerously quiet\"* or *\"Exhausted, barely holding it together\"*).\n* **Flexible Export:** Export as a single MP3 or as a **per-speaker Audacity project** (separate tracks for each character with labels).\n\n**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/Finrandojin/alexandria-audiobook](https://github.com/Finrandojin/alexandria-audiobook)\n\nI’m really looking for feedback from users on this, specifically if there are features (like better handling of markdown or specific web-novel formatting) that would make it more useful.",

      "text": "Hey everyone! I just published a blog post breaking down the architecture and benchmarks behind **qwen3-asr-swift**, an open-source Swift package that brings Qwen3's speech models to Apple Silicon natively using MLX Swift.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **ASR (Speech-to-Text):** Qwen3-ASR running on-device with \\~100ms time-to-first-token and RTF of 0.064 — supports 52 languages (30 major + 22 Chinese dialects)\n* **TTS (Text-to-Speech):** Qwen3-TTS generating natural, expressive speech faster than real-time (RTF < 1.0)\n* Runs entirely on Mac (M1–M4) and iOS — no cloud, no API keys\n\n**Why I built it:** There was no native Swift implementation of Qwen3 speech models. The Python/MLX ecosystem had `mlx-audio`, but if you wanted to integrate ASR or TTS into a Swift app, you were out of luck. This package gives you a clean Swift API with SPM support.\n\n**Quick taste of the API:**\n\nswift\n\n    import Qwen3ASR\n    let model = try await Qwen3ASRModel.fromPretrained()\n    let text = model.transcribe(audio: samples, sampleRate: 16000)\n\n**Key benchmarks (M3 Max):**\n\n* Qwen3-ASR-0.6B: WER 2.11% on LibriSpeech clean — and crucially, 17.88% in noisy conditions vs Whisper's 63.17%\n* Qwen3-ASR-1.7B: even better at 1.63% WER clean\n\nThe blog post dives into the full encoder-decoder architecture, mel spectrogram pipeline, how the audio encoder and Qwen3 text decoder are wired together, and real-world performance numbers.\n\n📖 Blog post: [https://blog.ivan.digital/qwen3-asr-swift-on-device-asr-tts-for-apple-silicon-architecture-and-benchmarks-27cbf1e4463f](https://blog.ivan.digital/qwen3-asr-swift-on-device-asr-tts-for-apple-silicon-architecture-and-benchmarks-27cbf1e4463f)\n\n💻 GitHub: [https://github.com/ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift](https://github.com/ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift)\n\nLicensed Apache 2.0.

Again grouping one reeeaaally long line with a bunch of small ones, same effect.\n\n3.  The ref\\_audio token count isn't known until it's been processed into a clone prompt, you can approximate from audio duration at \\~12 tokens/sec, but the exact cost depends on the tokenizer output.",

I started looking at the perplexity measurements for different models and perplexity isn't a 1:1 but seeing the rate of incorrect tokens explode usually with q4 being the cliff highlights how we are likely experiencing slightly different behaviors from our local models vs the full-size ones. I don't think that getting a different token from the original equates to a non working token but if something is 80% different you wouldn't call it identical either. Based on inferencer labs' HF for the model, q4 is around 90% accuracy. 1 out of every 10 tokens being different would make these local results make sense. It becomes a signal to noise issue for models with heavier quantization.\n\nPerfect timing describing quantization affect on token accuracy- \nhttps://youtu.be/Mq6FQIZ-GMw",

If you don't have a dedicated public IP address, but rather shared public IP address, you may be unfortunate enough to share the same IP address associated with suspicious online activities that would indicate automated scripts (also known as bot activities) and the first line of defense against that may just be enforced captcha. Some systems don't recognize individual devices, only IP addresses, so if there are multiple failed captcha solutions in a row, the system always resets and you have to try again which may seem to you as an individual that this captcha is broken because it denies you access even if you solve it correctly. The reason why is that at the same time there may be multiple other users from the same shared IP address trying to make the connection but failing the captcha at the same time which would overwhelm and confuse the protection layer so no matter what you're just not getting inside. This is pretty common with Tor connections or VPNs which are often associated with bots and hacking activities, but it may happen with regular connections as well.",
