      "text": "**Turn any book into an audiobook with AI voice synthesis!**\nI just released an open-source tool that converts PDFs, EPUBs, DOCX, and TXT files into high-quality audiobooks using **Qwen3 TTS** - the amazing open-source voice model that just went public.\n## What it does:\n**Converts any document format** (PDF, EPUB, DOCX, DOC, TXT) into audiobooks  \n**Two voice modes**: Pre-built speakers (Ryan, Serena, etc.) or clone any voice from a reference audio  \n**Always uses 1.7B model** for best quality  \n**Smart chunking** with sentence boundary detection  \n**Intelligent caching** to avoid re-processing  \n**Auto cleanup** of temporary files  \n## Key Features:\n- **Custom Voice Mode**: Professional narrators optimized for audiobook reading\n- **Voice Clone Mode**: Automatically transcribes reference audio and clones the voice\n- **Multi-format support**: Works with PDFs, EPUBs, Word docs, and plain text\n- **Sequential processing**: Ensures chunks are combined in correct order\n- **Progress tracking**: Real-time updates with time estimates\n## Quick Start:\nInstall Qwen3 TTS (one-click install with Pinokio)\nInstall Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\nPlace your books in `book_to_convert/` folder\nRun: `python audiobook_converter.py`\nGet your audiobook from `audiobooks/` folder!\n## Voice Cloning Example:\n```bash\npython audiobook_converter.py --voice-clone --voice-sample reference.wav\n```\nThe tool automatically transcribes your reference audio - no manual text input needed!\n## Why I built this:\nI was frustrated with expensive audiobook services and wanted a free, open-source solution. Qwen3 TTS going open-source was perfect timing - the voice quality is incredible and it handles both generic speech and voice cloning really well.\n## Performance:\n- Processing speed: ~4-5 minutes per chunk (1.7B model) it is a little slow im working on it\n- Quality: High-quality audio suitable for audiobooks\n- Output: MP3 format, configurable bitrate\n## GitHub:\n🔗 **https://github.com/WhiskeyCoder/Qwen3-Audiobook-Converter**\n**What do you think?** Have you tried Qwen3 TTS? What would you use this for?",
