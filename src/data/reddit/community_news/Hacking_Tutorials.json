It is such a large field and the knowledge in it is so extensive and specific that there is no forum where you can find everything. There is also no place on the web where you can find guides from A to Z. Also, no one will willingly spend their time and skills for free just so that you can hack someone step by step without any problems.\n\n\n\nhacker forums\n\n\n\nKnowledge should, as always, be derived from books, courses and practice. You need to know a lot of IT topics, such as networks, programming, security, cryptography. Additionally, spend a lot of time in front of the monitor, configuring, analyzing by clicking yourself. And I’m not talking about nights spent playing games ;)\n\n\n\nWithout practice, a theory in IT is just a theory, that you will never be able to use unless you try to do it yourself. This is probably nothing innovative, because it probably applies to every technical specialization. You can watch millions of hours of videos, read hundreds of books and tutorials, but until you sit down and click and solve the problems along the way, you won’t learn anything.\n\n\n\nBecause when you start doing things yourself, you will see that any tutorial, that tells you what to do step by step will not work as described by the author. The world is not perfect and nothing works as it should. If you don’t have a knowledge on some field, next important thing is to be able to find answers quickly and efficiently. That’s when Uncle Google comes to the rescue and a well-asked question. When I stuck somewhere then in most cases I find answer to my problem in Google or on one of the StackExchange sites.\n\n\n\nBelow you will find some links to hacking/cracking/carding forums. Remember to treat them as an additional source of knowledge. Don’t rely on everything you see there. Don’t trust everything you read there and don’t click on everything you can. There are also people who want to exploit your lack of knowledge or trust to e.g. increase their botnet :)\n\n\n\nThese forums are good place for security researchers. You can analyze some leaks, software and read how different people work and what techniques they use. Sometimes in these long forum threads you can find really interesting things.\n\n\n\nNot only in the forum, but in any other community or conversation, be ready to talk about the topic when you ask questions. Show that you’ve already done something about it. You clicked, read, tried to solve the problem but got stuck. Don’t be ignorant and ask general questions or ask for someone to lead you by the hand. Nobody will take you seriously and nobody will help you. If someone offers you a quick cheap solution, know that they are trying to cheat you.\n\n\n\nFocus on questions about an actual problem you have faced. Include details about what you have tried and exactly what you are trying to do. Avoid questions that are primarily opinion-based, or that are likely to generate discussion rather than answers.\n\n\n\n– [stackexchange.com](http://stackexchange.com)\n\n\n\nOk, that’s probably all I wanted to write today. Share with me interesting links to hacker forums or hacker communities you know.\n\n  \nhoek 2020-09-25 2024-09-21",

          "text": "So think of it like this. Let's say you are hacking manually.  Let's say you make a request to a server which takes advantage of a SSRF to download a pickle on your machine that can give you RCE and a shell.\n\nThat's a lot of steps you have to take one after the other. Now I'm really clumsy so instead of typing each command one after the other and juggling multiple windows at once, I might choose to write a bash script that does everything in a neat little package I just need to execute. This way you safely unplug and touch grass because you know even if your box expires, you can just come back the next day on run that exploit.\n\nNow some vulnerabilities need to you perform actions that are impossibly tedious or impossibly fast, this is where scripting goes from convenience to necessity. Sometimes you need to call kernel level libraries so you need to use C.\n\nPython is alright. It's a good middle between C and bash. It's complete enough so you don't have to suffer the jenk of bash but it can be low level enough so you can probably avoid touching C like 50% of the time. But you get the gist. This is basically the essence of writing exploits.\n\nThen you get down to the nuts and bolts and maybe you are working with a system that has AV or is actively scanning for software that uses library X so you have to obfuscate that or may flag your exploit for performing illegal writes so you have to obfuscate again. But this is where exploit start to become malware.\n\nThis is a field I actually really want to get into research wise but that's like a whole thing I'm not experienced in yet.\n\nIf you're keen you should practice a CTF and then attempt to automate the entire attack chain. Then you learn programming and how to exploit simultaneously.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m excited to share \\*\\*LCSAJdump\\*\\*, a static analysis framework I developed as part of my thesis. It’s designed to discover ROP and JOP gadgets in binaries using a graph-based approach rather than the traditional linear scan.\n\n\\*\\*The Problem:\\*\\* Most ROP scanners (like ROPgadget or Ropper) use a linear sliding-window approach. While fast, they often fail to find \\*\\*\"Shadow Gadgets\"\\*\\*—executable chains that span non-contiguous memory blocks connected by unconditional jumps or conditional branches.\n\n\\*\\*The Solution:\\*\\* LCSAJdump reconstructs the Control-Flow Graph (CFG) using \\*\\*LCSAJ (Linear Code Sequence and Jump)\\*\\* analysis. It models the binary as a directed graph and uses a custom \\*\\*Rainbow BFS\\*\\* algorithm to search backwards from control-flow sinks (\\`ret\\`, \\`jr\\`, etc.), effectively finding complex trampoline chains that bypass bad bytes.\n\n\\*\\*Key Features:\\*\\*\n\n\\* \\*\\*Universal Framework:\\*\\* While it has native, full support for \\*\\*RISC-V 64GC\\*\\* (including compressed instructions), the core engine is architecture-agnostic. You can add support for x86, ARM, or MIPS just by editing \\`config.py\\`.\n\n\\* \\*\\*Graph Reconstruction:\\*\\* Builds a directed graph of Basic Blocks via NetworkX.\n\n\\* \\*\\*Shadow Gadgets:\\*\\* Specifically targets non-contiguous chains hidden from linear views.\n\n\\* \\*\\*Heuristic Scoring:\\*\\* Ranks gadgets based on their utility (register manipulation, side effects).\n\n\\*\\*Installation:\\*\\* It's on PyPI, so you can just run: \\`pip install lcsajdump\\`\n\n\\*\\*Usage:\\*\\* \\`lcsajdump -a riscv64 -d 15 -k 100 my\\_binary\\`\n\nI’d love to get your feedback, especially if anyone is interested in helping extend the architecture profiles for x86/ARM!\n\n\\*\\*Repo:\\*\\* \\[https://github.com/chris1sflaggin/LCSAJdump\\](https://github.com/chris1sflaggin/LCSAJdump)\n\nHappy hacking!",
