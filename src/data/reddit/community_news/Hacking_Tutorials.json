I just want to add that after learnimg the basics, starting with they python ones, in my opinion the best book to get would be [Avannced Penetration Testing: Hacking the world's most secure networks](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Penetration-Testing-Hacking-Networks/dp/1119367689)\n\nThis last one assumes you have at least solid basic knowledge on hacking and programming (it will introduce c and c++ which are absolutely necessary) and will pave the way to take your skills to the next level.\n\nAnd as we are on the subject of recomending stuff, hackimg requires a lot imagination and  in the way you deploy the technics and skills you learn, id like to recommend some other somewhow ligher reads but a must in my opinion: first is Social Engineering: The art of human hacking - this one should be self explanatory. Next ones are the Stealing the Network trilogy - this is a work of fiction based on some real world hacking scenarios,  and the hacker playbook I and II - this ones are really good to develop your thinking out of the box skills.",

People love saying “everything’s encrypted now” like that’s the end of the story, but that’s not how it works in practice.\n\nTLS protects the data in transit, sure, but it doesn’t protect the endpoints. If the client is compromised, or if someone installs a custom root certificate, you can still intercept and mess with HTTPS traffic. That’s how tools like Burp Suite or mitmproxy work in real pentests. You install your cert on the device and now you’re in the middle of all that “secure” traffic.\n\nAlso, developers mess up TLS all the time. Sites miss HSTS headers. Mobile apps don’t validate certificates properly. Some APIs accept self-signed certs without question. There are still downgrade attacks, legacy protocols floating around, and broken cert pinning everywhere. It’s not uncommon to find a mobile app that just accepts anything as long as it gets some kind of TLS connection.\n\nAnd even when the encryption is solid, the metadata is still exposed. Stuff like IP addresses, DNS queries, hostnames through SNI, timing patterns, and packet sizes can leak a lot of information. You can do fingerprinting or traffic analysis even if you can’t see the raw payloads.\n\nIn CTFs this stuff still shows up all the time. You’ll get PCAP files with weak TLS, or challenges where you’re supposed to break or bypass HTTPS in some clever way. Knowing how to do MITM attacks is still super useful, even if you’re just trying to hook into a mobile app and see what kind of garbage data it’s sending over the wire.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m completely new to Kali Linux (about \\~5 hours in) and just started exploring how web apps are structured.\n\nWhile browsing my school’s website normally, I noticed something interesting and wanted to sanity-check my understanding and ask what I should learn next.\n\n**What I observed (high level, no exploitation):**\n\n* The main site behaves normally, but one section (online fees) redirects to a subpath like `/osm`\n* That subpath has a login page which appears to be used by admins as well\n* By manually visiting a deeper route like `/osm/home`, the page loads without authentication\n* Some dashboard/UI elements are visible, but when clicking anything sensitive it redirects back to the login page\n* No data was accessed, no actions were performed, and I stopped once I realized this could be an access-control issue\n\nFrom reading a bit, this *seems like* a **broken access control / missing authentication on routes**, where frontend checks exist but backend enforcement blocks actual actions.\n\nHow can i go furthur into more exploration",

What I mean by that is, I put together a small checklist that I know I can do every single day. Even with zero motivation. \n\n I answer at least  one question on TryHackme.com and consume one piece of cyber security related news/forum discussion. I try to do more when I can and usually do. Still. Very good routine to fall back on when motivation is lacking. \n\n2. I try as much as possible to get curious about what I’m learning. After I read through a lesson, I’ll ask. Have I seen this networking concept in action before? Why is this Shell better than other shells? Etc. exploring outside of your lessons (at least for me) can help keep the interest alive \n\nYou got this OP. Stay the course. There IS so much to learn.

Idk how the game relates to real life but the ability to acquire useful information from a plethora of resources to help aid with completing your goal is nuts. I think digital forensics is probably the closest occupation to what the game offers thus far.\n\nI’m having an issue in game with where to get injection values. Maybe I’m looking for the answer wrong, I’ve googled and gone on steam community, I can’t find anything. My question, how would you go about solving problems like this? I’m asking because I don’t know what resources are available in the world, nor what problems relate to what I’m asking. So please be nice, I am trying to learn lol how do you solve problems where the answer doesn’t punch you in the face? \n\nCommands prompt is quite fantastic. I never understood what exactly it did but from what I gather you’re talking directly to the computer in computer language.\n\nThere’s a lot of programs out there. I haven’t even looked into IRL stuff, but I’m assuming like most other products, there’s lots of options. Some do some things better or worse than others.\n\nWith the presence of scripting help I thinks it’s safe to assume scripting will be within the game. I’m looking forward to it.\n\nIm currently also reading hacking for dummies, it seems to be a generally good resource regarding the roles, responsibilities and ethics of hacking but outside of program recommendations there’s nothing actually teaching the things.\n\nFinal question, what can I do from command prompt that won’t get me into trouble? I just want to try things and see what comes up.\n\nGive me resources, critiques, questions or directions. I want to learn.\n\nThanks everyone.",

And that way of learning just suits me more\nAlso, it took me a while to figure out the cube system on HTBs academy\n\nAnd pwn.college has imho a different use case. THM prepares for more of a corporate experience, so you'll find boot2root machines there, content on modern attacks or network hacking \n\nOn the other hand, pwn.college is more for CTFs - they introduce you to core IT concepts, help with hacking when it comes to mostly lower-level stuff and lack bits on ex. Priviledge escalation\n\nBut I have to admit, they are amazing at explaining low level concepts and their assembly course was very cool",

My question is (I'm assuming they're based in the US) how are these guys putting out content that illustrates them clearly in violation of a half dozen federal laws,  all while seemingly unconcerned with law enforcement knocking on their door?  And to be clear,  I think what they are doing is morally acceptable,  albeit legally forbidden.  So I'm not trying to knock what they're doing,  I'm just curious about their apparent disinterest with potential consequences.\n\nI can come to 1 of 3 conclusions.   Either they're working directly with the feds and enjoy some level of immunity (most likely), or they have their opsec so incredibly locked down that they feel it's safe to put the content out (least likely), or they just dgaf and are just flexing because they think the feds won't bother themselves with prosecuting someone for pulling some digital Robbin Hood shit (somewhat plausible)\n\nAnyone can shed some insight?",

I'm not saying it can't be modified to send a continuous signal, but there's better hardware to accomplish this. \n\nBluetooth classic utilizes 79 channels and BLE uses 40 channels. Both use encryption and performs frequency hopping. Frequency Hopping means it changes from one of the 79 or 40 channels to another channel 1600 times a second.\n\nYou'd need to orchestrate 40 or 79 of them together to accomplish simple channel blocking and that alone won't hinder the connection.",

      "text": "Heyy everyone. I’ve loved the thought of “hacking” (as I understand it) for a long time, though never had a clear starting point.\n\nThanks to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking\\_Tutorials/s/io4kksLfw5\n\nI have a starting point. Games.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to make money off this skill. I have a good career with 15 years left. My intent is to slowly gain experience and credentials over the next 15 years so I can properly market myself when I retire from my current position. It’s a long road, but I have time and lots of patience.\n\nAnyway, my questions.\n\n1) Can someone explain what precautions you use? VPNs for example. And when/why you started using them?\n\n2) how do you know if what you’re doing is legal?\n\n3) Does anyone do this as a side hustle? What does it look like for you? Tell me your experiences.\n\nI do want to learn coding to a degree, but likely not programmer level coding. 4) when does coding become less of a convenience and more of a necessity?\n\n5) what material can I pick up to learn from when I have time but no computer access? I love audio books, if you have any audible suggestions please let me know. \n\nI’m current planning to put 6-8 hours a week into practice and 2-4 hours a week for learning.\n\nThank you in advance.",

You need to be able to understand written code and write scripts yourself.\n5. Hackers Playbook books are nice. I'd also recommend books on sysadmin stuff for Linux and Windows, as well as networks.\n\nEDIT: checked the linked thread. Don't go by that guy's recommendation with games and AI. Do it right from the start and actually learn the fundamentals so you can start the hacking journey properly. I did post a comment in that thread when it was made, so I recommend looking for my comment there and you'll see my reasoning.",

I know I don’t need full time school to learn this over time lol \n\n3: okay. Is it your job? Hobby hacker? What does an average “hacking session” look like for you?\n\n4: okay, do you know of free online courses that I can learn from? Do you think learning this material is easier with the visual aids I can’t get from audio books?\n\n5: I see there’s multiple, are they updated versions? Or a series of books building on each other?\n\nEdit: I understand what you are saying and do absolutely intend on learning code. The problem I’ve always had is where to start. At least with the game I can start in a safe, controlled environment to get a bare understanding of what I’m looking at. Something to turn my curiosity into passion without the massive wall of a bunch of topics at once with no idea how to find what I need, utilize what I find or even what the purpose of my learning is.",
