I just want to add that after learnimg the basics, starting with they python ones, in my opinion the best book to get would be [Avannced Penetration Testing: Hacking the world's most secure networks](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Penetration-Testing-Hacking-Networks/dp/1119367689)\n\nThis last one assumes you have at least solid basic knowledge on hacking and programming (it will introduce c and c++ which are absolutely necessary) and will pave the way to take your skills to the next level.\n\nAnd as we are on the subject of recomending stuff, hackimg requires a lot imagination and  in the way you deploy the technics and skills you learn, id like to recommend some other somewhow ligher reads but a must in my opinion: first is Social Engineering: The art of human hacking - this one should be self explanatory. Next ones are the Stealing the Network trilogy - this is a work of fiction based on some real world hacking scenarios,  and the hacker playbook I and II - this ones are really good to develop your thinking out of the box skills.",

People love saying “everything’s encrypted now” like that’s the end of the story, but that’s not how it works in practice.\n\nTLS protects the data in transit, sure, but it doesn’t protect the endpoints. If the client is compromised, or if someone installs a custom root certificate, you can still intercept and mess with HTTPS traffic. That’s how tools like Burp Suite or mitmproxy work in real pentests. You install your cert on the device and now you’re in the middle of all that “secure” traffic.\n\nAlso, developers mess up TLS all the time. Sites miss HSTS headers. Mobile apps don’t validate certificates properly. Some APIs accept self-signed certs without question. There are still downgrade attacks, legacy protocols floating around, and broken cert pinning everywhere. It’s not uncommon to find a mobile app that just accepts anything as long as it gets some kind of TLS connection.\n\nAnd even when the encryption is solid, the metadata is still exposed. Stuff like IP addresses, DNS queries, hostnames through SNI, timing patterns, and packet sizes can leak a lot of information. You can do fingerprinting or traffic analysis even if you can’t see the raw payloads.\n\nIn CTFs this stuff still shows up all the time. You’ll get PCAP files with weak TLS, or challenges where you’re supposed to break or bypass HTTPS in some clever way. Knowing how to do MITM attacks is still super useful, even if you’re just trying to hook into a mobile app and see what kind of garbage data it’s sending over the wire.",

That's not an issue at all.\n\nCertificate in TLS are used for the identity validation, not for encryption (they could but there are far better algorithms today like DHE)\n\nWhat protects you is that a MITM should not be able to have a valid certificate for your target. So, how could they?\n\nAnother technical challenge is: How will the victim reach the attacker's machine\n\n### Compromising Signature\n\n#### Use invalid / no certificate\n\nAs dumb as it seems, many people will just access the site even if they have a warning.\n\n#### Private Key leaks\n\nIf thes can steal the private, they just have to copy the certificats returned by the server\n\n#### look-alike name\n\nThis can be categorized as fishing. The difference is what you do after the login.\n\n#### Injected Trusted CA\n\nYou might have installed without knowing the hacker certificate when you installed a malware.\n\nAny of their sites will then be trusted.\n\n#### Cracking private key\n\nResearchers think that around 2030-2035 quantum computers will be able to crack a private key in about 8h to 7 days. \nNot everyone can afford it, but that's a risk\n\n### Directing the user\n\n- DNS poisoning (not everybody as DNSSEC active)\n- Route poisoning\n- ARP poisoning\n- Untrusted Network (e.g. free wifi)\n- ....\n\n## Why do MITM (Goal)\n\nto steal data, respond wrong data, change data, ...\nAny of these can benefit an hacker is some ways.",

It’s only been this year that I’ve really buckled down and started heavily perusing CS as my career. \n\n2 things have helped me. \n\n\n1. I found a bare minimum study structure that works for me. What I mean by that is, I put together a small checklist that I know I can do every single day. Even with zero motivation. \n\n I answer at least  one question on TryHackme.com and consume one piece of cyber security related news/forum discussion. I try to do more when I can and usually do. Still. Very good routine to fall back on when motivation is lacking. \n\n2. I try as much as possible to get curious about what I’m learning. After I read through a lesson, I’ll ask. Have I seen this networking concept in action before? Why is this Shell better than other shells? Etc. exploring outside of your lessons (at least for me) can help keep the interest alive \n\nYou got this OP. Stay the course. There IS so much to learn.

      "text": "Some pretty well funded,  professionally produced YouTube channels out there that make content in this niche.   My question is (I'm assuming they're based in the US) how are these guys putting out content that illustrates them clearly in violation of a half dozen federal laws,  all while seemingly unconcerned with law enforcement knocking on their door?  And to be clear,  I think what they are doing is morally acceptable,  albeit legally forbidden.  So I'm not trying to knock what they're doing,  I'm just curious about their apparent disinterest with potential consequences.\n\nI can come to 1 of 3 conclusions.   Either they're working directly with the feds and enjoy some level of immunity (most likely), or they have their opsec so incredibly locked down that they feel it's safe to put the content out (least likely), or they just dgaf and are just flexing because they think the feds won't bother themselves with prosecuting someone for pulling some digital Robbin Hood shit (somewhat plausible)\n\nAnyone can shed some insight?",

Chat GPT has recommended the JR Penetration Tester path and the Web Application Penetration Tester path on THM before moving onto HTB to get into that rhythm slowly breaking myself into it.\n\nMy question is this, for someone that has completed TCM PEH, are these two paths still useful to do on THM with the easier learning style, or should I just jump straight to HTB.\n\nMy goals are to eventually complete CPTS, CWES and CWPE.",

      "text": "Heyy everyone. I’ve loved the thought of “hacking” (as I understand it) for a long time, though never had a clear starting point.\n\nThanks to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking\\_Tutorials/s/io4kksLfw5\n\nI have a starting point. Games.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to make money off this skill. I have a good career with 15 years left. My intent is to slowly gain experience and credentials over the next 15 years so I can properly market myself when I retire from my current position. It’s a long road, but I have time and lots of patience.\n\nAnyway, my questions.\n\n1) Can someone explain what precautions you use? VPNs for example. And when/why you started using them?\n\n2) how do you know if what you’re doing is legal?\n\n3) Does anyone do this as a side hustle? What does it look like for you? Tell me your experiences.\n\nI do want to learn coding to a degree, but likely not programmer level coding. 4) when does coding become less of a convenience and more of a necessity?\n\n5) what material can I pick up to learn from when I have time but no computer access? I love audio books, if you have any audible suggestions please let me know. \n\nI’m current planning to put 6-8 hours a week into practice and 2-4 hours a week for learning.\n\nThank you in advance.",

You need to be able to understand written code and write scripts yourself.\n5. Hackers Playbook books are nice. I'd also recommend books on sysadmin stuff for Linux and Windows, as well as networks.\n\nEDIT: checked the linked thread. Don't go by that guy's recommendation with games and AI. Do it right from the start and actually learn the fundamentals so you can start the hacking journey properly. I did post a comment in that thread when it was made, so I recommend looking for my comment there and you'll see my reasoning.",

I know I don’t need full time school to learn this over time lol \n\n3: okay. Is it your job? Hobby hacker? What does an average “hacking session” look like for you?\n\n4: okay, do you know of free online courses that I can learn from? Do you think learning this material is easier with the visual aids I can’t get from audio books?\n\n5: I see there’s multiple, are they updated versions? Or a series of books building on each other?\n\nEdit: I understand what you are saying and do absolutely intend on learning code. The problem I’ve always had is where to start. At least with the game I can start in a safe, controlled environment to get a bare understanding of what I’m looking at. Something to turn my curiosity into passion without the massive wall of a bunch of topics at once with no idea how to find what I need, utilize what I find or even what the purpose of my learning is.",
