      "text": "My favourite CTF categories are PWN and Reverse Engineering. I think about it time to time, but I can’t figure out how threat actors exploit binary vulnerabilities (e.g. UAF) in real world\n\nConsider following scenario — attacker wants to gain access to victim’s machine through either OS or software vulnerability. He doesn’t have any access to machine. He knows that victim runs Windows. He even knows it is Windows 10. However it’s still unclear what release build is it. Vulnerability, which is not zero day already and known to work on previous builds is obviously patched after security update. Attacker doesn’t know whether victim is running cutting edge build with all updates applied or didn’t update system since installation\n\nBut that’s only OS versioning. When it comes to software, it gets even worse. One may run MS-Office 2021, 2019, 2010 or even older. They are completely different and have different functionality, so is the code \n\nMicrosoft may also recompile different parts of system between updates, thus making seemingly small changes to binaries, that are in fact mandatory when it comes to e.g. heap layout-based exploits. Even one removed variable may (and probably will) change routine’s stack layout, so exploit needs to adapt too. Different compiler optimisation changes everything. One inlined function changes everything\n\nSo attacker needs to know the exact version and build of OS, exact version of software to either find new vulnerabilities or search databases for known ones. In the end of a day — it is always better to test whether everything works locally before an actual exploitation. All version information remains unknown until attacker gains access to machine. But he can’t gain access because he doesn’t have that information. This is the part I do not understand\n\nTL;DR: How do threat actors exploit vulnerability on machine they don’t have access yet if they don’t know exact version of binary. Even small change between software versions might cause binary exploit to fail\n\nI’ll be grateful for any piece of information regarding this, thank you ",

      "text": "# Did you know that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is no longer immune to phishing?\n\nThe other day, I was catching up on the news and noticed a surge in social media account thefts. Many victims were confused—they had MFA enabled, and the links they clicked appeared to be legitimate.\n\nDriven by my curiosity and my perspective as a cybersecurity student, I decided to investigate. I think I’ve found the key.\n\nEven if the website itself is legitimate (which it is), **are you accessing it in a legitimate way?**\n\nLet me explain: even if the site is the real deal, the link you received could be directing you through an unauthorized server. By using a **Reverse Proxy**, an attacker can intercept your data in plain text. We aren't just talking about your username and password—which MFA would normally protect—but also your **session cookies**. With these cookies, an attacker can hijack your active session from any device, bypassing the need for an MFA code entirely.\n\nTheory is one thing, but I wanted to see it in action. I developed a **PoC (Proof of Concept)** for educational purposes to document this process and help users avoid these sophisticated scams. I want to emphasize: the destination site is real; the path you take to get there is not.\n\nI invite anyone interested in learning more to check out my GitHub repository:\n\n[https://github.com/v0id0100/Evilginx2-Proof-of-Concept----By-v0id](https://github.com/v0id0100/Evilginx2-Proof-of-Concept----By-v0id)\n\n*This project is strictly for educational purposes, intended to document the process and provide evidence of a very real, current security risk.*",
