They help, but they don’t make you invisible. Most people who get caught don’t get caught because the tech “failed.” They get caught because they made a mistake. They reused a username. Logged into something personal once. Mixed identities. Used the same email. Bragged to the wrong person. One small slip is enough.\n\nAnonymity isn’t about installing a few apps. It’s about discipline. Keeping identities completely separate. Not crossing streams ever. Thinking about how payments, timing, writing style, and behavior can link back to you. Investigators often catch people through patterns and correlation, not by breaking encryption.\n\nAnd the idea of erasing your trace completely just isn’t realistic. The internet runs on logs. Data gets copied, cached, archived. Once something is out there, you usually don’t control all the copies anymore.\n\nThe people who stay anonymous long term treat it like a lifestyle, not a trick. Even then it’s not perfect. It’s about reducing risk, not eliminating it.\n\nTotal invisibility is a myth. Careful operational security just lowers the odds of getting exposed.",

While sitting with your laptop, open, seemingly working or  Looking at stuff on your computer.  That's location.Shut off will be close to a Wi-Fi network that you have.And on that network , you should have a zombie or two that is ready for you to remote in control.  This is the second part of being anonymous.  You aren't invisible, bc I that's impossible.  You are anonymous though.  How, bc when you surf around it doesnt look like you surfing.  It looks like the owner of the zombie you are connected to.  When you are done, you erase all traces of you being connected to that PC and router.  Even if that means wiping it out.  Number 5, do this by yourself and dont tell anyone your business.  I repeat, do this by yourself.  If you do something and have a partner, 9 times out of 10 if they get caught, they will fold.  And the next thing they will do is tell on you and place all the blame on you.  Do this by yourself and dont say shit.  The guys around the watercooler say this is how most people get caught.  So there you go, Anonymity.  There is a cost to achieve that and there is stress and potentially your freedom S well.  Thats where the purpose comes in.  Make sure you believe in what you are doing.  In any event, I hope that helped.  Like I said, this is all stuff that I've heard over the years regarding this subject.  And on top of that anything I have said in this post is for educational purposes only and hacking into networks you do not own is against the law.  ",

TAILS routes traffic through Tor and forgets everything when you shut it down. It is digital smoke. Whonix isolates network traffic through Tor inside virtual machines. Qubes compartmentalizes everything so one mistake does not torch your whole system. Pick your tool based on how disciplined you are. Most people overestimate their discipline.\n\nDisable your microphone and camera physically. Tape is cheap. Paranoia is expensive. Better yet, remove or disconnect them if you know how. Keep Bluetooth off. Keep your BIOS locked. Encrypt everything. Use strong passphrases that you actually remember without writing on a sticky note.\n\nTechnology is only half the equation. Operational security is behavior. Do not log into personal accounts. Do not reuse usernames. Do not talk about what you are doing. The weakest link is not the software. It is ego and laziness.\n\nPrivacy is not about hiding evil. It is about refusing to live naked in a surveillance carnival. If you are going to do it, do it with discipline.

I used to think it was this incredibly powerful, advanced hacking operating system that could turn the world upside down as soon as you installed it. I imagined I’d be able to hack my friends’ social media accounts, track locations from phone numbers, access cameras—all with just a few clicks.\n\n\n\nAt the time, I also thought it might be dangerous, so I decided I would only use Kali Linux once I had a secondary laptop.\n\n\n\nNow, many years later, when I finally got a new laptop, I remembered that old dream and installed Kali on my old one. But honestly, I feel disappointed. It’s not what I imagined at all. Most of the things I once thought were possible seem to require phishing attacks—which I doubt anyone would fall for—or they’re not as simple as the videos made them seem. Either the tutorials aren’t easily available anymore, or maybe those things were never as easy or realistic as I believed.",

It's just an OS with preloaded tools. You can do the same thing with Ububtu. The videos you seen were probably easy (By today's standards), because someone took the time to study systems and look for weak points. When the weak points are discovered, they get patched (hopefully). You would think that would make things stronger, but they can open up pathways to new exploits. Humans are the weakest point in any system. There's a reason people use social engineering and phishing attacks, because they work. Kali is useless if you don't put your nose to the grind, study, and learn what you're trying to exploit.",

Depends on the firewall, how restrictive the rules are, if you know the config, many things\n\n> Using a pkg file\n\npkg files require signing. Your question specifically relates to firewalls, so technically this is beyond the scope of the question, but this is relevant. Self signing would (I believe, not being a MacOS expert) throw warnings. Obtaining a valid certificate could be challenging \n\n> I was wondering how easy would it be to install malware in devices like Macs or PS who use this to download stuff like games as the software can run any executable code and is dangerous if you download from a untrustworthy source\n\nThe same as downloading an untrusted msi file. Or dpkg. Or rpm. \n\n> if there is any way to actually check if it is executing anything beside the intended function.\n\nYes. Behavioural monitoring in a sandbox is commonly done. It *can* be reverse engineered. Network monitoring. Log monitoring. Many more",

Before writing this lab, I was unfamiliar with **React Flight Protocol.** The process of writing this lab and working through the exploitation taught me quite a bit. Very interesting, this one!\n\n# Lab Steps: (Participants Will)\n\n* **Define the React Flight Protocol:** Analyze how streaming and serialization improve performance and user experience.\n* **Assess Severity and Global Scope:** Evaluate the CVSS 10.0 impact and evaluate real-world exposure data.\n* **Learn About JavaScript Prototype Inheritance:** Explore the `__proto__` chain to understand how applications resolve properties and why \"blueprint\" manipulation is a critical risk.\n* **Patch Note:** This is the mechanism patched in the current versions of REACT. (End Users can no longer tamper with prototypes.)\n* **Analyze Serialized Data Streaming:** Investigate how data is divided into indexed ‘chunks’ and how the pointer-based system manages server-side function arguments.\n* **Audit HTTP Traffic via Burp Suite:** Intercept and dissect POST requests to identify framework-specific indicators like the `text/x-component` Accept header.\n* **Automate Reconnaissance with Nuclei:** Utilize the Nuclei engine to perform detection.\n* **Execute Prototype Pollution:** Manually craft a malicious multi-part stream to hijack the global Object prototype and achieve RCE.\n* **Analyze the Exploit Line by Line:** Examine what happens at each step of the exploitation process. Every line in the malicious POST request we create has a purpose.",
