I called the buiness and warned them about the camera and in the next few minutes they went and turned off and took down the camera. anyway, my question is, is there a way I can find more unsecured cameras to warn people. because its honestly suprizing how easy it is and especially since there was unsecured daycare and school cams, I want to stop it from being watched. i swear to my god im not using this for discusting reasons, and i hate to imaging people are.

Finish the fundamentals, then specialize. If web exploitation and bug bounties are your goal, focus more on HTTP, web app behavior, OWASP Top 10, and reading real exploit code instead of trying to master Python upfront.

      "text": "My favourite CTF categories are PWN and Reverse Engineering. I think about it time to time, but I can’t figure out how threat actors exploit binary vulnerabilities (e.g. UAF) in real world\n\nConsider following scenario — attacker wants to gain access to victim’s machine through either OS or software vulnerability. He doesn’t have any access to machine. He knows that victim runs Windows. He even knows it is Windows 10. However it’s still unclear what release build is it. Vulnerability, which is not zero day already and known to work on previous builds is obviously patched after security update. Attacker doesn’t know whether victim is running cutting edge build with all updates applied or didn’t update system since installation\n\nBut that’s only OS versioning. When it comes to software, it gets even worse. One may run MS-Office 2021, 2019, 2010 or even older. They are completely different and have different functionality, so is the code \n\nMicrosoft may also recompile different parts of system between updates, thus making seemingly small changes to binaries, that are in fact mandatory when it comes to e.g. heap layout-based exploits. Even one removed variable may (and probably will) change routine’s stack layout, so exploit needs to adapt too. Different compiler optimisation changes everything. One inlined function changes everything\n\nSo attacker needs to know the exact version and build of OS, exact version of software to either find new vulnerabilities or search databases for known ones. In the end of a day — it is always better to test whether everything works locally before an actual exploitation. All version information remains unknown until attacker gains access to machine. But he can’t gain access because he doesn’t have that information. This is the part I do not understand\n\nTL;DR: How do threat actors exploit vulnerability on machine they don’t have access yet if they don’t know exact version of binary. Even small change between software versions might cause binary exploit to fail\n\nI’ll be grateful for any piece of information regarding this, thank you ",

Unfortunately, your country is currently among those affected.\n\n \n\nDue to this, we will not be able to provide you services at this time.\n\n \n\nWe understand how disappointing this news may be, and we truly appreciate your understanding.\n\n \n\nThese decisions were not made lightly and reflect broader compliance obligations beyond our control.\n\n \n\nIf our policy changes in the future and we’re once again able to serve your region, we’d be happy to welcome you back.\n\nDont know if this has anything with Heath leaving but this sucks.",
