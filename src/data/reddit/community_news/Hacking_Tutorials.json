OP you didn’t write shit & you didn’t build shit you’re a larp you literally just downloaded it off Vx underground \n\nThis is literally the medusa builder panel right off vx-underground in the builder subdirectory just scroll and you’ll find it. \n\nThis is not ‘red team’ this is skid tier crimeware \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/OLBi92p\n\n\n\nAnyone that believes this dumbass deserves that backdoor he put in the panel, download it yourself off vx underground if you really want to play with skid crimeware\n\n\n\nAll the people that upvoted this are dumbasses too. I can’t believe this bullshit post got 70+ upvotes the blind leading the blind\n\nThis subreddit needs a cleanup it’s fucking garbage if this what gets 70+ upvotes & shoved onto my feed. This isn’t even hacking all OP did is download it off vxug and post a vid claiming it’s his there is 0 hacking in this it’s just skid tier malware \n\nMods should 1000% delete OPs post this isn’t hacking",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nTwo years ago, I made the jump from software development to cybersecurity. The learning curve was steep, not because the concepts were impossible, but because I couldn't find a single resource that connected networking fundamentals to real-world security. Networking books ignored exploits. Security books assumed you already understood the stack. I spent months piecing it together from scattered sources.\n\nSo I wrote the book I wish I'd had: Network Fundamentals & Security Exploits.\n\nPart 1 — How networks actually work\n\n* OSI model & TCP/IP stack (explained practically, not like a textbook)\n* Data link, IP, transport, and application layer protocols\n* Routing, infrastructure, and wireless networking\n\nPart 2 — How they get exploited\n\n* Attacks at every layer: ARP spoofing, IP fragmentation, TCP exploits, application-layer vulnerabilities\n* Man-in-the-middle patterns\n* DoS attacks and wireless exploitation\n* Reconnaissance techniques\n* Defense and mitigation strategies\n\nThe idea is simple: understand how something works, then understand how it breaks. Each concept in Part 1 has a corresponding vulnerability in Part 2.\n\nIf you're a student breaking into cybersecurity, a developer curious about the infrastructure you deploy on, or just someone who wants to understand how the internet actually works — this might save you some of the confusion I went through.\n\nLink: [https://4849347256801.gumroad.com/l/network-fundamentals-and-security-exploits](https://4849347256801.gumroad.com/l/network-fundamentals-and-security-exploits)\n\nYour honest feedback is much appreciated. Thank you!  \n\\-----------------------------\n\n**UPDATE**: The entire book is now free to read online at [https://netsecurityexploits.online/](https://netsecurityexploits.online/)\n\nNo paywalls, no sign-ups, no email gates. Just start reading.\n\nIf you find it useful and want to support the project (or just want PDF/EPUB for offline reading), you can still grab it on Gumroad at [https://4849347256801.gumroad.com/l/network-fundamentals-and-security-exploits](https://4849347256801.gumroad.com/l/network-fundamentals-and-security-exploits) — but it's completely optional.",

The code examples (scapy scripts, nmap commands, mitmproxy configs) are things I've actually used. The RFC references are ones I looked up.

ESP32 scans for target networks\n2. Creates fake AP with same SSID on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz\n3. Deauth clients from real network\n4. Clients reconnect to fake AP\n5. Captive portal captures credentials\n6. All traffic logged with PCAP export\n\nMost evil twin tutorials only show 2.4GHz. Modern devices prefer 5GHz, so if your fake AP is 2.4GHz-only, clients stay on 5GHz and ignore your evil twin.\n\nThis is for learning how these attacks work and testing on networks you own or have permission to test.",

This is how a ton of students, labs, and even junior SOC folks learn.\n\nThe danger doesn’t come from “hackers instantly escaping your VM.” It comes from bad networking choices and convenience features you forgot to disable.\n\nYou’re already thinking in the right direction.\n\nThe actual risk zones (pay attention here)\n\nNAT only\n\nSafe for learning tools, not great for a honeypot. Outside attackers can’t reach it unless you forward ports.\n\nHost-only\n\nVery safe. VM talks only to host. Great for malware learning, bad for real internet noise.\n\nBridged\n\nThis is where things get spicy. The VM is now a real machine on your LAN.\n\nFor your current stage:\nNAT + selective port forwarding is the sweet spot.\n\nYour current setup is actually solid\nWindows Server 2016 + Ubuntu is a good pairing.\n\nYou don’t need live ransomware samples to learn defense.\nYour caution is healthy, not fearful. Your setup is sane, not reckless. And your progression makes sense.\n\nThe most dangerous thing in security isn’t experimenting — it’s thinking you already know enough.

It says that it's perfect for beginners and already experienced ethical hackers, but that is just trash talk. It's a waste of time and I wouldn't recommend getting this course. If anybody wants the zip file with the course contents then dm me and save your money. Maybe if you want the free aveeno and want to collaborate with him its worth it, but don't set your expectations too high cause so far the course seems to be a disappointment.\n\nOne more thing: If you go on hackerone, his account says he has no submissions. I also couldn't find his account on bugcrowd. So unless there is some type of privacy setting on hackerone I don't know about, or if all the bugs he finds are outside of hackerone, then he is lying about his skill level as a hacker. It could also be that he just wanted money and would gatekeep his knowledge and tell things that wouldn't bring more competition to his field. \n\n  \nTLDR: Course didn't teach anything new that couldn't be learned from youtube or free courses. It was a waste of money for the most part. If you want a good course for free APISEC university has a free api hacking course, or if you want a good paid for course, TCM has many great courses for learning all types of hacking at a reasonable price.",

Mine are relatively old from the 00's.  I'm old son.  \n\nAlso, what you really need is a practical foundation --basically what and how general abuse takes place.  If you know what to look for you can do your own research, which is what you should be doing anyway.  Most books aren't going to hand hold you through it.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and start learning these techniques.  If you can get through this list, understand it all, and walk through some of your implementations, then you'll learn a lot and the foundation will lead you to into that world:\n\n* Process Injection\n* Process Hollowing\n* Process Doppelgänging\n* Process Herpaderping\n* Process Ghosting\n* Process Carving\n* Reflective PE Loading\n* Shellcode Injection (staged and stageless)\n* Shared Section Mapping",

Meaning, any smartphone that isn't registered here, when you insert a sim card into it, it begins a 120 days count down, after that finishes, you can't make or receive calls or sms. So with a dual sim phone, you can use it for 8 months and the rest of the year, you need to use another phone for hot-spot as well as making and receiving calls. This applies to any brand. This block on the imei number gets lifted in January of every year. There is a tax that one can pay to register the phone and use it normally, but it's more than $1k, which is pretty darn expensive",

The Telco in your area uses those numbers to issue you a (phone number) and they are in control. \n\nWhy not just buy a bunch of sim cards? Are you saying that each IMEI can only use one sim card for 120 days?

The SIM is used for network registration, calls, billing, etc. what I'm asking is have you tried multiple sims (you said you've tried 2 in a dual sim phone - with 2 imei). I'm trying to ask you what the usage is tied to. Will simply changing an IMEI allow you to use the same already registered foreign sim card?? Only the sim card would let the carrier know the sim provider info, not the IMEI\n. So can you use several sim cards on one IMEI (device)? After 120 days can you swap sims continuously?? Or is it one sim per IMEI. If it is then why would a new IMEI allow the already used sim again??",

In Turkey, mobile phones are heavily taxed, to prevent illegally imported devices and people buying phones by going abroad, every IMEI address needs to be registered in Turkey, if not after 120 days it gets blocked. To be able to register a phone, you need a passport with a recent abroad trip which the passport holder hasn't registered a phone in the last two years.
