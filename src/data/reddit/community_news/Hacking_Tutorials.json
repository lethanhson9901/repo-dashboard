I’m excited to share that I’ve started a new open-source repository on GitHub called **Hacking-Cheatsheets**.\n\nMy goal is to create a comprehensive knowledge base for Penetration Testing tools and Red Team operations.\n\n✅ **Current Release:** I’ve kicked things off with a deep dive into the **Metasploit Framework** and **Meterpreter**, covering everything from basic commands to advanced post-exploitation techniques.\n\nI will be constantly updating this repo with new tools like Nmap, Burp Suite, and more.

If you have a desktop computer, create a simple, html file, and share it privately on your local network.

As someone else said, https is only for encryption (so maybe a stranger can't see what you are doing). \n\nAnway, common vulnerabilities have to do with technologies that allow any user to have non authorized access about some resource of the webpage and even with the server itself (like having a shell). This depends on unupdated versions or zero-day exploits. \n\nThere are many exploits and vulnerabilities public, that's so you can know and protect yourself, for example, by updating the software you use for creating your website or whatever. You can search for them if you are curious.\n\nWhen you use F12 on your browser, you'll see a console. That can help you to use some functions that are written in the code of the webpage. That's where they might try to do something. There's also a Network layer that hackers could see to inspect api calls for example, they can extract the url and make custom api calls, change HTTP requests (the method, any value). They can try diferent routes (fuzzing) and maybe you can have access to a resource the webpage wouldn't show you normally.\n\nThat kind of things. I hope this can help people to take care of their websites. Do not do this without permission.",

Many offer extremely affordable or free student tickets (if they don't advertise them then write a polite letter to the organizers, I run one and have never turned any students away). Often the most accessible are B-sides conferences. These are great for hands on learning, lectures in lots of topics and networking/asking professionals what paths they took and to learn about specialty parts of the field you may not have thought about before. Sometimes its a lot of risk and questions for parents, many of these events encourage high school students to attend together or with a parent or teacher to make everyone feel more comfortable.",

The actual cookies and passwords themselves are encrypted using AES256-GCM, and the DPAPI encrypted decryption key is stored in a json file along with a bunch of other data.\n\nSo, decrypt the dpapi encrypted encryption key, read the sqlite database and decrypt the aes encrypted passwords.\n\nIn newer versions of Chrome/Chromium/Edge, there's an additional check, LSA checks to see if the calling process is Chrome/Chromium/Edge before forking over the decrypted encryption key. It's called Application Bound Encryption.\n\nhttps://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/improving-security-of-chrome-cookies-on.html\n\nIt's a bunch of hoops that your average security tool can identify, but for an end users device with no corporate EDR, it's basically plaintext.

          "text": "Here’s a fun networking side one, if you can gain access, you can configure a network tap. BUT the network traffic is encrypted, well… mostly. Once you crack in, you add a user based regkey, this key will generate a value to be used in the encryption of tls/ssl streams, once you have this, the key can then be exfiltrated along with the network traffic, and if stored in a pcap, then provides the full, unencrypted traffic including usernames and passwords passed through the data stream. This is a high level networking trick, and requires initial breach and/or access before it can be used. But it’s a fun one! I use it sometimes for troubleshooting issues at work.",

Look for a website URL that has numeric parameters. \n\n[https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/women/holiday-key-moments?cid=3052418&nav=meganav%3AWOMEN%3ADISCOVER%3AThe%20Winter%20Edit](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/women/holiday-key-moments?cid=3052418&nav=meganav%3AWOMEN%3ADISCOVER%3AThe%20Winter%20Edit)\n\nTheir web site is expecting the \"cid\" parameter to be numeric. You can try replacing it with a non-numeric value:\n\ncid=305hello2418\n\nIf it's poorly-coded, they won't validate that the parameter is numeric, and an error will occur somewhere, because source code almost always doesn't like strings masquerading as numbers. In this example though, they're just catching the mistake and displaying an \"item not found\" message.\n\nDepending on how poorly-coded the site is, they might pass the value straight through to their database, where an error will be thrown that may give away some of their database structure. Then you start tinkering further to see what other information you can glean.\n\nOther examples are going to a web site, opening the Web Developer Tools / Inspector view, looking for hidden web page elements that may contain interesting functionality, and disabling the CSS property that hides it so that you can view it. Or inspecting the source code for hidden stuff. You just need to be creative.",
