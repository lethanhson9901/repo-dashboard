      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nTwo years ago, I made the jump from software development to cybersecurity. The learning curve was steep, not because the concepts were impossible, but because I couldn't find a single resource that connected networking fundamentals to real-world security. Networking books ignored exploits. Security books assumed you already understood the stack. I spent months piecing it together from scattered sources.\n\nSo I wrote the book I wish I'd had: Network Fundamentals & Security Exploits.\n\nPart 1 — How networks actually work\n\n* OSI model & TCP/IP stack (explained practically, not like a textbook)\n* Data link, IP, transport, and application layer protocols\n* Routing, infrastructure, and wireless networking\n\nPart 2 — How they get exploited\n\n* Attacks at every layer: ARP spoofing, IP fragmentation, TCP exploits, application-layer vulnerabilities\n* Man-in-the-middle patterns\n* DoS attacks and wireless exploitation\n* Reconnaissance techniques\n* Defense and mitigation strategies\n\nThe idea is simple: understand how something works, then understand how it breaks. Each concept in Part 1 has a corresponding vulnerability in Part 2.\n\nIf you're a student breaking into cybersecurity, a developer curious about the infrastructure you deploy on, or just someone who wants to understand how the internet actually works — this might save you some of the confusion I went through.\n\nLink: [https://4849347256801.gumroad.com/l/network-fundamentals-and-security-exploits](https://4849347256801.gumroad.com/l/network-fundamentals-and-security-exploits)\n\nYour honest feedback is much appreciated. Thank you!  \n\\-----------------------------\n\n**UPDATE**: The entire book is now free to read online at [https://netsecurityexploits.online/](https://netsecurityexploits.online/)\n\nNo paywalls, no sign-ups, no email gates. Just start reading.\n\nIf you find it useful and want to support the project (or just want PDF/EPUB for offline reading), you can still grab it on Gumroad at [https://4849347256801.gumroad.com/l/network-fundamentals-and-security-exploits](https://4849347256801.gumroad.com/l/network-fundamentals-and-security-exploits) — but it's completely optional.",

                  "text": "I think I’ve compiled some lists from various folders containing ebooks and documents. There are about 30 folders in total, with some nested inside others. I’ve stored a few in private cloud files, which include text files with expanded URLs. I have around 40 ebooks whose titles I can scan and paste into a file, along with a couple of hundred tutorial files. I’ve found some interesting stuff, like “Alchemy” books and “The Anarchist Cookbook” in full, file by file.\n\nWhen I’m in my pirate boat sailing the World Wide Web and the seven seas of the Internet, I often come across interesting treasures and add them to my collection over the years😆🏴‍☠️ It’s like a treasure chest of rare and valuable stuff, some passed down to me and some not. I didn’t realize the value of many of these files until recently. I started going through them about a year ago and discovered names of teams and solo hackers from the 90s and early 2000s, which was fascinating.\n\nThere are a lot of duplicates I need to clean up to get an accurate count. Last time I checked thoroughly, there were over 2000 individual files and ebooks. At one point, I had about another 1000 ebooks in one folder. I had every “For Dummies” ebook for about 30 years, but they took up so much space that I stored them on different hard drives and cloud storage to ensure they were safe.\n\nI’ll keep you updated on everything. I’m thinking of finding a way to host this collection without getting into trouble. I could charge a reasonable price for a digital library card, update encryption tokens, and make it user-specific. If everything goes well, I hope to get it online and allow people to contribute, expanding it into a real resource. I also want to include a feature where users can annotate books or leave comments, which could be helpful for others.\n\nI’m trying to share a collection of significant and rare titles, tutorials, and network protocols. Growing up, I had an uncle who was a hacker and computer engineer, which sparked my interest in computers. I’m not a hacker, but I know a lot about operating systems. I’ve been fascinated by how computers communicate since I was a child, thanks to my uncle TRYING to build a protege of me but he taught me like my eight-year-old self just joined the Navy and I was like I can’t do this right now lmfao. Sadly he’s no longer here but he taught me of a lot of a lot of things. Like I remember in grade school in Catholic school lol I scripted a real simple payload that I hid in the title or information of various game icons in the computer lab like Mavis Beacon teachers typing and Carmen San Diego so when people opened it a window open and it’s a shut down timer would start and then the PC would shut off and I had eventually got one of those until like 3 to 4 different game icons on every computer and I remember one day eventually everyone’s just going on and off and on and off it was hilarious. I was in my fifth grade maybe it was hilarious🤣 \n\nI even created a simulated hacking setup on my Kali machine that replicates the DOS boot sequence, giving me a cool Batman-like vibe. It connects me to my proxy chains, VPN, Wi-Fi, and Tor browser in the background. It even displays fake messages from a fake hacker, and I respond with quotes from Duke Nukem. It took a lot of time to set up, but I got really invested in it.",

Live mode is fine for demos and general tooling, but GPU work usually means proper drivers, not just CPU fallback.

This depends on unupdated versions or zero-day exploits. \n\nThere are many exploits and vulnerabilities public, that's so you can know and protect yourself, for example, by updating the software you use for creating your website or whatever. You can search for them if you are curious.\n\nWhen you use F12 on your browser, you'll see a console. That can help you to use some functions that are written in the code of the webpage. That's where they might try to do something. There's also a Network layer that hackers could see to inspect api calls for example, they can extract the url and make custom api calls, change HTTP requests (the method, any value). They can try diferent routes (fuzzing) and maybe you can have access to a resource the webpage wouldn't show you normally.\n\nThat kind of things.

      "text": "Deadoverflow is a youtuber with over 53k subscribers. He hosts a course and advertises it in his videos as well as in his description: \n\n\"I help you break into bug bounty hunting the right way:  \n✅ Find real vulnerabilities (not just scan & pray)  \n✅ Master web security with practical methods  \n✅ Think like a hacker & stay ahead of the game  \n  \n💡 Whether you're a beginner or leveling up, my videos will teach you how to spot security flaws, analyze websites, and build a winning mindset.  \n  \n🔥 Want exclusive content? Join my membership for behind-the-scenes bug bounty techniques, deep dives & case studies!\"\n\nThese are big claims but he doesn't stop there when it comes to advertising his course. When you go to the website [https://deadoverflow.gumroad.com/l/mastering-cybersecurity-course?utm\\_source=video&utm\\_medium=short&utm\\_campaign=short-course&utm\\_term=hacking&utm\\_content=short](https://deadoverflow.gumroad.com/l/mastering-cybersecurity-course?utm_source=video&utm_medium=short&utm_campaign=short-course&utm_term=hacking&utm_content=short) in his description, he says many things to help convince you the course is worth it. \n\n**What Makes This Course Different?**\n\n>\n\nWhy You Should Join NOW?\n\n💰 Insane value for a cheap price\n\n🚀 Skills that can lead to real bug bounty payouts\n\n🎯 Perfect for beginners & already experienced ethical hackers\n\nOnce the 200 spots are filled, this course is gone forever.\n\n>\n\n>This course is created by a real-world hacker, not a theorist.\n\n>🧨 Creator has:\n\n>Earned $100k+ in private bounties\n\n>Found a Windows Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability\n\n>Earned an official CVE for disclosed vulnerabilities\n\n>Responsibly reported and helped fix real security flaws used by real users\n\n>Discovered multiple real vulnerabilities in production systems\n\nSo I took the bait and gave the course a chance. I bought the premium package which was 16$ with tax and gave the course a look. It was just basic tutorials that you could've found on youtube for free. Things like how to find idor, how to find xss, or how to find csrf. There are many youtube tutorials that go into way more detail then what was done in his tutorials. It says that it's perfect for beginners and already experienced ethical hackers, but that is just trash talk. It's a waste of time and I wouldn't recommend getting this course. If anybody wants the zip file with the course contents then dm me and save your money. Maybe if you want the free aveeno and want to collaborate with him its worth it, but don't set your expectations too high cause so far the course seems to be a disappointment.\n\nOne more thing: If you go on hackerone, his account says he has no submissions. I also couldn't find his account on bugcrowd. So unless there is some type of privacy setting on hackerone I don't know about, or if all the bugs he finds are outside of hackerone, then he is lying about his skill level as a hacker. It could also be that he just wanted money and would gatekeep his knowledge and tell things that wouldn't bring more competition to his field. \n\n  \nTLDR: Course didn't teach anything new that couldn't be learned from youtube or free courses. It was a waste of money for the most part. If you want a good course for free APISEC university has a free api hacking course, or if you want a good paid for course, TCM has many great courses for learning all types of hacking at a reasonable price.",

Meaning, any smartphone that isn't registered here, when you insert a sim card into it, it begins a 120 days count down, after that finishes, you can't make or receive calls or sms. So with a dual sim phone, you can use it for 8 months and the rest of the year, you need to use another phone for hot-spot as well as making and receiving calls. This applies to any brand. This block on the imei number gets lifted in January of every year. There is a tax that one can pay to register the phone and use it normally, but it's more than $1k, which is pretty darn expensive",

The aim card has an IMSI number that's registered in your carriers network so it sounds like IMEI isn't the issue or you could just get another phone and use the same expired (on one device) sim card. The Telco in your area uses those numbers to issue you a (phone number) and they are in control. \n\nWhy not just buy a bunch of sim cards? Are you saying that each IMEI can only use one sim card for 120 days? That if you changed aims after that it wouldn't work?\n\nJust curious I think you need someone who is familiar with your local cell network to be able to assist you.",

I'm trying to ask you what the usage is tied to. Will simply changing an IMEI allow you to use the same already registered foreign sim card?? Only the sim card would let the carrier know the sim provider info, not the IMEI\n. So can you use several sim cards on one IMEI (device)? After 120 days can you swap sims continuously?? Or is it one sim per IMEI. If it is then why would a new IMEI allow the already used sim again??",

In Turkey, mobile phones are heavily taxed, to prevent illegally imported devices and people buying phones by going abroad, every IMEI address needs to be registered in Turkey, if not after 120 days it gets blocked. To be able to register a phone, you need a passport with a recent abroad trip which the passport holder hasn't registered a phone in the last two years.
