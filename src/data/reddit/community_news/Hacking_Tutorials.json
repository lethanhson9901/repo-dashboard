      "text": "Edit: Thanks to everyone who helped blow this post up. The disinformation and misinformation directed at beginners is rampant everywhere online.\nYou don't need to be a biologist (certified CISCO networking genius) to be a carpenter (a technician level beginner to expert technician) just because you work with wood. This is ridiculous. \n\nNo one writes all their own tools. Some of us may have the ability to code, but even those of us who do probably still download tons of stuff from github. \n\nFor the love of God, people here need to stop telling beginners to \"learn to code\". That's the slowest multi year journey into being a hacker anyone can suggest. \n\nSo, now that we're no longer a bunch of master hacker elitists (we're obviously not, right?) \nWe need to realize the true starting point that beginners on this sub are starting from.\n\nDead giveaway questions:\n\n1. Do i need a computer, all I have is a phone?\n\nYou can still learn command line and download OSINT tools to learn some things,  but it is highly limited.\n\n2. My computer is a potato,  can I use it to hack?\n\nYes, but probably only with a bare metal install of Linux. Continually suggesting a virtual box environment with tons of hyper visor overhead is not helping the OPs. Their systems are crashing and they walk away discouraged instead of empowered.  \n\n3. Do I need to learn to program? \n\nNo! You actually do not need to know *that* much. Sure there are some needs as you become more advanced to modify programs,  but you don't need this to start with! As I said before EVERYONE is a script kid unless you write all the programs you use...and I don't care who you are, YOU DON'T.  \n\n4. Is using AI cheating?\n\nYes! And cheating is exactly what hackers do! \n\nThere are limits to AI, but for beginners learning command line,  its a indispensable tool! If you get an error trying to use command line, copy that error message, and paste it into the chat box for your AI model, and it will tell you where it went wrong. \n\n\nThe number 1 starting point to learning to be a hacker is to learn how to use the command line. \n\nThat's what we need to be telling people.  One of the easiest ways to get started learning command line is to download a hacking simulator game from STEAM and play it. \n\nIts easier to do this than download virtual box and make a virtual machine. That's great to do, but I'd recommend trying that later. \n\nLet's stop this trend of zero upvotes for good questions from people who just want to dip their toe in the water and see if this subject is for them or not. \n\nLet's stop the trend of people who only have phones to work with, and telling them they can't hack. Yes, they can. They definitely CAN learn command line with termux and that's the most important thing to know to get started.\n\nYes you can use your phone to reverse shell, yes you can download lazyscript from github, or nethunter and use your phone like a kali Linux desktop.  Yes....you can. \n\nThanks for reading my Ted talk. Let's make this space welcoming and informative for beginners. ",

How do you learn underlying networking and security??? You start hacking. And you do that in a legal way. Hence my suggestions for simulators which are cheap and easy to play, and also totally legal. \n\nMost people who use the tools available don't fully know what they can do! They know enough to do some basic things,  but they may not understand full functionality either.\n\nYou can do a hour long search with Sherlock for example:\n\n/: sherlock jane_doe \n\nAnd get some results, and as you learn more you can do so way faster and search any possible NSFW websites they may be connected to by adding NSFW and a timeout command,\n\n/: sherlock jane_doe nsfw --timeout 2\n\nI knew how to \"use\" sherlock before I knew how to *REALLY*  use it. \n\nIts a learning process, even for the most basic tools available.  No one is writing all the tools, no one understands everything there is to know about networks, or security on them.... so what is your point? Real hackers get caught ALL THE TIME. they clearly don't know everything either, this doesn't mean they aren't hackers.",

The most efficient way to learn security and especially networking, isn't hacking without prior knowledge, that's for sure.\n\nThere's a reason why in the job market you usually get IT jobs, helpdesk, sysadmin and such, then you pivot to cyber security, and only then you go into offensive security (hacking). Sure, it's not always like that, I pivoted from IT directly to offensive, but still, I had very good networking and systems' knowledge and IT>security>offensive is the usual baseline for a reason.\n\nLess gatekeeping? All for it. But IMO we should push even harder for people learning the basics first (not coding, just how things work in general), especially for their sake but also for the sake of the companies that they test.",

If shift-left is really the goal, then paying $50k for an enterprise license like NexusIQ or Kondukto will only take you so far if the developers don't actually address a vulnerabilty with the guidance they get when a build gets stopped, and the security team can't make heads or tails of a proper fix and just want the code to look like the example provided by OWASP. Sometimes, it isn't as easy as just copying the snippet.\n\nSo you're right that you can definitely get in the door and begin to learn; but if you really want to get ahead of the sea of candidates sporting \"credentials\" for exposure to a webinar, you need something that conveys a practical application of skills.  \n  \nThe faster they learn to *read* code, the faster they will learn to find vulnerabilities, modify tools, customize exploits, and eventually learn to write code of their own. A huge part of the upper echelon of offsec training requires exploit development, even if it's rudimentary. If you traverse the PentesterLab training material, you will find so many badges that require you to take a code snippet and modify it ever so slightly, or even write part of it yourself with guidance, that in order to complete the full series of badges, you WILL gain some coding knowledge, including but not limited to looking at vulnerable code and devising a way to attack it.\n\nYou can solve the first 10 badges with minimum coding experience, and it will do a LOT to establish your practical abilities, and you can do all of these for a single 1-month subscription:\n\n* Unix\n* Essentials\n* Recon\n* HTTP\n* PCAP\n* Intercept\n* White\n* Serialize\n* Yellow\n* Blue",

          "text": "I mean, I get where you're coming from, but I don't agree.\n\nHacking is an advanced subject. Networking, OSes, and programming are the basics.\n\nHacking is playing a sick guitar solo. Networking, OSes, and programming is learning to tune the guitar.\n\nDo you need to be an expert on all of it? Absolutely not, but that doesn't mean you don't need them first.\n\nExamples: say a dude is running an nmap scan on a machine. It spits out the output of open ports without headers. Just the numbers. Had he known about networking, he'd have known that port 22 most likely is ssh and could try some stuff there. Port 80 or 443? He'd know it's hosting a website and to check that.\n\nSay a dude is trying to run an exploit. He finds a python script that does it, but it doesn't run. Why? Simple. The person that made the script removed the parentheses for a function to prevent skids from blindly downloading and running. But the dude in question doesn't know a lick of programming, so he doesn't know how to fix it.\n\nSay a dude is trying to do some privilege escalation. He doesn't know what crontab is, because he never learned Linux. If he had, he'd know that there's a shell script being run every hour, and that the shell script has 777 permissions. Then again, he doesn't know what 777 permissions are, since he didn't learn Linux.\n\nThere's a reason why any reputable school that teaches this goes through the basics first. Sure, you can learn as you go, play steam games, and use AI, but that can only get you so far and it'll just be much more difficult than it has to be. With that route, sooner or later you will hit a wall, and you only have surface level understanding your AI has fed you, much of which will be plain wrong hallucinated information, and can't progress.\n\nThis isn't about gatekeeping. It's about giving beginners realistic skills to ACTUALLY learn hacking. But you are right, everyone is a skid at first, but only those who learn properly can get out of the skid camp.\n\nIf learning the basics is too daunting, then hacking isn't the right path for that person, because hacking will lead to FAR more daunting learning curves later down the line anyway.",

      "text": "Hi! I want to share results of my research where I compared Nmap, Masscan and Rustscan in port scanning.\n\nI did this to find the best tool and its configuration for engagements that usually consists of 100-1000 hosts. It should not miss open ports, because at high speed scanners false, and at low speed you might loose hours.\n\nI deployed a scan stand of 4 machines with 22 services (standard and not standard ports) and ran scanners against it.\n\nWhat I tested:   \n• Home and cloud networks   \n• Different cloud providers and regions   \n• Single scanner runs   \n• Multiple scanner processes on one machine   \n• Distributed scanning setups\n\nSome conclusions from the tests:   \n• in scans from cloud, all three scanners showed almost the same performance. It makes me think that for scopes of hundred or thousands hosts all three scanners are almost the same.   \n• In unstable networks with packet loss, Nmap performs better due to its retry logic. Rustscan and masscan make retries in any way, while nmap only in case of loosing packet   \n• Don't run multiple instances of scanner on one machine to speed up a scan - a lot of wrappers do it - better to up rate for 1 instance.   \n• If you place the scanner in one cloud with the target it might provide \\~30% boost.   \n• geography doesn’t mean if scanner and target are in one cloud\n\nIf you want to dive into details you may read the article [https://medium.com/@2s1one/nmap-vs-masscan-vs-rustscan-myths-and-facts-62a9b462241e](https://medium.com/@2s1one/nmap-vs-masscan-vs-rustscan-myths-and-facts-62a9b462241e)\n\nUPD:  \nFull tcp range port scan to find all ports in 30 runs   \nThe best results from VPS  \nNmap: 17.49 s  \nMasscan: 18.03 s  \nRustscan: 16.39 s\n\nThe best results from my home network 100 mbps  \nnmap 71.27 s  \nmasscan 85.72 s  \nrustscan 787.75",

Any computer running with at least 6gb of ram (shit even 4, would be rough but still doable) would run a 1gb Linux VM. \n\nOnce you get a VM running start watching YT videos and doing tutorials. Get a TryHackMe subscription. Start with the basics.  If you have never used Linux before, DO NOT START with Kali Linux. Start with Ubuntu or MintOS, or PoPOS, and learn the basics. Learn the file system and basic commands first. If you start with Kali, you might get overwhelmed with all the tools installed. Just learn the basics first!\n\nUsing your phone is not ideal at all.

No one writes all their own tools and software,  if they claim to, they are very likely to be liars. \n\nThere are some prerequisites to hacking, but they are primarily hardware related. If you have a laptop or desktop computer and a flash drive you can definitely get started.\n\nAre you a gamer? Buy \"Anonymous hacking simulator \" on STEAM. Its a fun game that will teach you a little about how the real tools function. While giving you a sand box to play in legally without actually breaking the law and getting yourself in trouble. \n\nYou need some distribution of Linux to learn command line. Yes, you can run Linux command line in windows powershell if you use windows,  but its going to be easier using Linux. \n\nFocus for now on simulator hacking games and basics of command line.

ESP32 scans for target networks\n2. Creates fake AP with same SSID on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz\n3. Deauth clients from real network\n4. Clients reconnect to fake AP\n5. Captive portal captures credentials\n6. All traffic logged with PCAP export\n\nMost evil twin tutorials only show 2.4GHz. Modern devices prefer 5GHz, so if your fake AP is 2.4GHz-only, clients stay on 5GHz and ignore your evil twin.\n\nThis is for learning how these attacks work and testing on networks you own or have permission to test.",

I will say that Sektor7 has a couple of good courses that are WindowsAPI heavy.  It's mostly malware dev and evasion techniques but that's pretty much what you're asking for.  \n\nWhat I can recommend are the Windows Internals books themselves --I believe there are updated versions.  Mine are relatively old from the 00's.  I'm old son.  \n\nAlso, what you really need is a practical foundation --basically what and how general abuse takes place.  If you know what to look for you can do your own research, which is what you should be doing anyway.  Most books aren't going to hand hold you through it.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and start learning these techniques.  If you can get through this list, understand it all, and walk through some of your implementations, then you'll learn a lot and the foundation will lead you to into that world:\n\n* Process Injection\n* Process Hollowing\n* Process Doppelgänging\n* Process Herpaderping\n* Process Ghosting\n* Process Carving\n* Reflective PE Loading\n* Shellcode Injection (staged and stageless)\n* Shared Section Mapping",

You can see some of the tools used in them however, so you learn the names but that’s about it. The modern technical systems we have to crack into now are too advanced to bring into a game and so what you see are usually logical challenges or puzzles in the hacking game instead. I hate to break it to you but if you want to actually have fun and hack the best bet is probably greyhack, but it is a very very very low level into “hacking” and is more of a hacking related video game.",

I'd need to consult my notes and research what would actually be effective though.\n\nAs a fellow entropy enthusiast, be my friend. Nice and amazing stuff and great timing.",

That way if there is a ton of accurate interference it becomes more generalized and focused on disruption. Lower capability hardware would have to suffer longer buffer times as a result of course but...privacy is the motto and course.\n\nI don't think it would be remiss to have things like don't use touch screens for a specific time. I'd need to do, again, more research and notes on the specific activities required but...touch screen capacitance in theory, could be used to alter muscle behavior. \n\nSecurity without any compromise.\n\nI will be watching this.",
