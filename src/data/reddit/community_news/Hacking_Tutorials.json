      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nTwo years ago, I made the jump from software development to cybersecurity. The learning curve was steep, not because the concepts were impossible, but because I couldn't find a single resource that connected networking fundamentals to real-world security. Networking books ignored exploits. Security books assumed you already understood the stack. I spent months piecing it together from scattered sources.\n\nSo I wrote the book I wish I'd had: Network Fundamentals & Security Exploits.\n\nPart 1 — How networks actually work\n\n* OSI model & TCP/IP stack (explained practically, not like a textbook)\n* Data link, IP, transport, and application layer protocols\n* Routing, infrastructure, and wireless networking\n\nPart 2 — How they get exploited\n\n* Attacks at every layer: ARP spoofing, IP fragmentation, TCP exploits, application-layer vulnerabilities\n* Man-in-the-middle patterns\n* DoS attacks and wireless exploitation\n* Reconnaissance techniques\n* Defense and mitigation strategies\n\nThe idea is simple: understand how something works, then understand how it breaks. Each concept in Part 1 has a corresponding vulnerability in Part 2.\n\nIf you're a student breaking into cybersecurity, a developer curious about the infrastructure you deploy on, or just someone who wants to understand how the internet actually works — this might save you some of the confusion I went through.\n\nLink: [https://4849347256801.gumroad.com/l/network-fundamentals-and-security-exploits](https://4849347256801.gumroad.com/l/network-fundamentals-and-security-exploits)\n\nYour honest feedback is much appreciated. Thank you!  \n\\-----------------------------\n\n**UPDATE**: The entire book is now free to read online at [https://netsecurityexploits.online/](https://netsecurityexploits.online/)\n\nNo paywalls, no sign-ups, no email gates. Just start reading.\n\nIf you find it useful and want to support the project (or just want PDF/EPUB for offline reading), you can still grab it on Gumroad at [https://4849347256801.gumroad.com/l/network-fundamentals-and-security-exploits](https://4849347256801.gumroad.com/l/network-fundamentals-and-security-exploits) — but it's completely optional.",

The code examples (scapy scripts, nmap commands, mitmproxy configs) are things I've actually used. The RFC references are ones I looked up.

                  "text": "I think I’ve compiled some lists from various folders containing ebooks and documents. There are about 30 folders in total, with some nested inside others. I’ve stored a few in private cloud files, which include text files with expanded URLs. I have around 40 ebooks whose titles I can scan and paste into a file, along with a couple of hundred tutorial files. I’ve found some interesting stuff, like “Alchemy” books and “The Anarchist Cookbook” in full, file by file.\n\nWhen I’m in my pirate boat sailing the World Wide Web and the seven seas of the Internet, I often come across interesting treasures and add them to my collection over the years😆🏴‍☠️ It’s like a treasure chest of rare and valuable stuff, some passed down to me and some not. I didn’t realize the value of many of these files until recently. I started going through them about a year ago and discovered names of teams and solo hackers from the 90s and early 2000s, which was fascinating.\n\nThere are a lot of duplicates I need to clean up to get an accurate count. Last time I checked thoroughly, there were over 2000 individual files and ebooks. At one point, I had about another 1000 ebooks in one folder. I had every “For Dummies” ebook for about 30 years, but they took up so much space that I stored them on different hard drives and cloud storage to ensure they were safe.\n\nI’ll keep you updated on everything. I’m thinking of finding a way to host this collection without getting into trouble. I could charge a reasonable price for a digital library card, update encryption tokens, and make it user-specific. If everything goes well, I hope to get it online and allow people to contribute, expanding it into a real resource. I also want to include a feature where users can annotate books or leave comments, which could be helpful for others.\n\nI’m trying to share a collection of significant and rare titles, tutorials, and network protocols. Growing up, I had an uncle who was a hacker and computer engineer, which sparked my interest in computers. I’m not a hacker, but I know a lot about operating systems. I’ve been fascinated by how computers communicate since I was a child, thanks to my uncle TRYING to build a protege of me but he taught me like my eight-year-old self just joined the Navy and I was like I can’t do this right now lmfao. Sadly he’s no longer here but he taught me of a lot of a lot of things. Like I remember in grade school in Catholic school lol I scripted a real simple payload that I hid in the title or information of various game icons in the computer lab like Mavis Beacon teachers typing and Carmen San Diego so when people opened it a window open and it’s a shut down timer would start and then the PC would shut off and I had eventually got one of those until like 3 to 4 different game icons on every computer and I remember one day eventually everyone’s just going on and off and on and off it was hilarious. I was in my fifth grade maybe it was hilarious🤣 \n\nI even created a simulated hacking setup on my Kali machine that replicates the DOS boot sequence, giving me a cool Batman-like vibe. It connects me to my proxy chains, VPN, Wi-Fi, and Tor browser in the background. It even displays fake messages from a fake hacker, and I respond with quotes from Duke Nukem. It took a lot of time to set up, but I got really invested in it.",

As someone else said, https is only for encryption (so maybe a stranger can't see what you are doing). \n\nAnway, common vulnerabilities have to do with technologies that allow any user to have non authorized access about some resource of the webpage and even with the server itself (like having a shell). This depends on unupdated versions or zero-day exploits. \n\nThere are many exploits and vulnerabilities public, that's so you can know and protect yourself, for example, by updating the software you use for creating your website or whatever. You can search for them if you are curious.\n\nWhen you use F12 on your browser, you'll see a console. That can help you to use some functions that are written in the code of the webpage. That's where they might try to do something. There's also a Network layer that hackers could see to inspect api calls for example, they can extract the url and make custom api calls, change HTTP requests (the method, any value). They can try diferent routes (fuzzing) and maybe you can have access to a resource the webpage wouldn't show you normally.\n\nThat kind of things.

Many offer extremely affordable or free student tickets (if they don't advertise them then write a polite letter to the organizers, I run one and have never turned any students away). Often the most accessible are B-sides conferences. These are great for hands on learning, lectures in lots of topics and networking/asking professionals what paths they took and to learn about specialty parts of the field you may not have thought about before. Sometimes its a lot of risk and questions for parents, many of these events encourage high school students to attend together or with a parent or teacher to make everyone feel more comfortable.",

Meaning, any smartphone that isn't registered here, when you insert a sim card into it, it begins a 120 days count down, after that finishes, you can't make or receive calls or sms. So with a dual sim phone, you can use it for 8 months and the rest of the year, you need to use another phone for hot-spot as well as making and receiving calls. This applies to any brand. This block on the imei number gets lifted in January of every year. There is a tax that one can pay to register the phone and use it normally, but it's more than $1k, which is pretty darn expensive",

The aim card has an IMSI number that's registered in your carriers network so it sounds like IMEI isn't the issue or you could just get another phone and use the same expired (on one device) sim card. The Telco in your area uses those numbers to issue you a (phone number) and they are in control. \n\nWhy not just buy a bunch of sim cards? Are you saying that each IMEI can only use one sim card for 120 days? That if you changed aims after that it wouldn't work?\n\nJust curious I think you need someone who is familiar with your local cell network to be able to assist you.",

I'm trying to ask you what the usage is tied to. Will simply changing an IMEI allow you to use the same already registered foreign sim card?? Only the sim card would let the carrier know the sim provider info, not the IMEI\n. So can you use several sim cards on one IMEI (device)? After 120 days can you swap sims continuously?? Or is it one sim per IMEI. If it is then why would a new IMEI allow the already used sim again??",

In Turkey, mobile phones are heavily taxed, to prevent illegally imported devices and people buying phones by going abroad, every IMEI address needs to be registered in Turkey, if not after 120 days it gets blocked. To be able to register a phone, you need a passport with a recent abroad trip which the passport holder hasn't registered a phone in the last two years.

You can try replacing it with a non-numeric value:\n\ncid=305hello2418\n\nIf it's poorly-coded, they won't validate that the parameter is numeric, and an error will occur somewhere, because source code almost always doesn't like strings masquerading as numbers. In this example though, they're just catching the mistake and displaying an \"item not found\" message.\n\nDepending on how poorly-coded the site is, they might pass the value straight through to their database, where an error will be thrown that may give away some of their database structure. Then you start tinkering further to see what other information you can glean.\n\nOther examples are going to a web site, opening the Web Developer Tools / Inspector view, looking for hidden web page elements that may contain interesting functionality, and disabling the CSS property that hides it so that you can view it.
