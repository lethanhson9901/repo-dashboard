When i press a button the 8266 d1 start sending packets, deauth, probes and fake request to all 13 channels, slowing down speed by a lot, makes the ping higher and sometimes it can log you out from the wifi. The cc1101 does 2 simple things, when I press a button, it start listening, if he receive a signal, he save it and emulate it, the second functionality it's just saturating the 433 and lower frequencies trying to not make you communicate with what you want (example, remote key for your garage door).

And that way of learning just suits me more\nAlso, it took me a while to figure out the cube system on HTBs academy\n\nAnd pwn.college has imho a different use case. THM prepares for more of a corporate experience, so you'll find boot2root machines there, content on modern attacks or network hacking \n\nOn the other hand, pwn.college is more for CTFs - they introduce you to core IT concepts, help with hacking when it comes to mostly lower-level stuff and lack bits on ex. Priviledge escalation\n\nBut I have to admit, they are amazing at explaining low level concepts and their assembly course was very cool",

      "text": "I started playing anonymous hacker simulator to get an idea of what working with computers in such a capacity entails.\n\nSo to start, y’all are detectives. Idk how the game relates to real life but the ability to acquire useful information from a plethora of resources to help aid with completing your goal is nuts. I think digital forensics is probably the closest occupation to what the game offers thus far.\n\nI’m having an issue in game with where to get injection values. Maybe I’m looking for the answer wrong, I’ve googled and gone on steam community, I can’t find anything. My question, how would you go about solving problems like this? I’m asking because I don’t know what resources are available in the world, nor what problems relate to what I’m asking. So please be nice, I am trying to learn lol how do you solve problems where the answer doesn’t punch you in the face? \n\nCommands prompt is quite fantastic. I never understood what exactly it did but from what I gather you’re talking directly to the computer in computer language.\n\nThere’s a lot of programs out there. I haven’t even looked into IRL stuff, but I’m assuming like most other products, there’s lots of options. Some do some things better or worse than others.\n\nWith the presence of scripting help I thinks it’s safe to assume scripting will be within the game. I’m looking forward to it.\n\nIm currently also reading hacking for dummies, it seems to be a generally good resource regarding the roles, responsibilities and ethics of hacking but outside of program recommendations there’s nothing actually teaching the things.\n\nFinal question, what can I do from command prompt that won’t get me into trouble? I just want to try things and see what comes up.\n\nGive me resources, critiques, questions or directions. I want to learn.\n\nThanks everyone.",

Both use encryption and performs frequency hopping. Frequency Hopping means it changes from one of the 79 or 40 channels to another channel 1600 times a second.\n\nYou'd need to orchestrate 40 or 79 of them together to accomplish simple channel blocking and that alone won't hinder the connection.",

And to be clear,  I think what they are doing is morally acceptable,  albeit legally forbidden.  So I'm not trying to knock what they're doing,  I'm just curious about their apparent disinterest with potential consequences.\n\nI can come to 1 of 3 conclusions.   Either they're working directly with the feds and enjoy some level of immunity (most likely), or they have their opsec so incredibly locked down that they feel it's safe to put the content out (least likely), or they just dgaf and are just flexing because they think the feds won't bother themselves with prosecuting someone for pulling some digital Robbin Hood shit (somewhat plausible)\n\nAnyone can shed some insight?",
