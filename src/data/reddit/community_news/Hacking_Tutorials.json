When i press a button the 8266 d1 start sending packets, deauth, probes and fake request to all 13 channels, slowing down speed by a lot, makes the ping higher and sometimes it can log you out from the wifi. The cc1101 does 2 simple things, when I press a button, it start listening, if he receive a signal, he save it and emulate it, the second functionality it's just saturating the 433 and lower frequencies trying to not make you communicate with what you want (example, remote key for your garage door).

And that way of learning just suits me more\nAlso, it took me a while to figure out the cube system on HTBs academy\n\nAnd pwn.college has imho a different use case. THM prepares for more of a corporate experience, so you'll find boot2root machines there, content on modern attacks or network hacking \n\nOn the other hand, pwn.college is more for CTFs - they introduce you to core IT concepts, help with hacking when it comes to mostly lower-level stuff and lack bits on ex. Priviledge escalation\n\nBut I have to admit, they are amazing at explaining low level concepts and their assembly course was very cool",

They heavily score the sending IP reputation, domain age, rDNS, TLS, sending patterns, and a bunch of ML signals. If you’re sending from a random VPS with no history, it’ll likely get silently dropped.\n\nSMTP spoofing still works at the protocol level, but getting it delivered to major inboxes without proper infrastructure and reputation is the real challenge now.",

          "text": "not dead but pretty close for the major providers. heres why you're hitting walls:\n\ngmail and microsoft have layered defenses now that go way beyond just checking SPF/DKIM/DMARC:\n\n1. even if the target domain has NO spf/dkim/dmarc records, gmail still checks the sending IP reputation. if you're sending from a random VPS or your home IP, that IP has zero reputation and gmail treats it as suspicious by default. the days of spinning up a cheap VPS and sending spoofed mail are over.\n\n2. gmail now does reverse DNS checks, HELO/EHLO verification, and checks if the sending IP is on any blacklists. all of this happens before it even looks at SPF/DKIM.\n\n3. content-based ML filtering has gotten insanely good. gmail's spam classifier catches patterns that have nothing to do with authentication — link structures, header anomalies, sending patterns that dont match legitimate mail servers.\n\n4. for domains that DO have DMARC with p=reject (which is increasingly common), spoofing is basically impossible to land in inbox. the email gets rejected at the server level before the recipient even sees it.\n\n5. zohomail has similar protections. they run their own reputation system and reject mail from untrusted sources regardless of what the sender domain's DNS says.\n\nwhere spoofing still works: smaller/self-hosted mail servers that dont have these ML layers, older corporate exchange servers with minimal filtering, and some regional email providers. but gmail, outlook, yahoo, zoho — effectively dead for spoofing.\n\nthe real answer to \"what am I missing\" is that authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) is now just one layer of many. even without it, the other layers catch you.",

How? Instead of a brute-force linear sweep, it uses **optimized graph traversal with early pruning**. My benchmarks show it **prunes \\~22% of invalid paths** immediately. It’s not just faster; it’s mathematically more efficient at discarding noise.\n* **Depth:** It reconstructs the CFG to find 'Shadow Gadgets' (jumps/predicates) that linear scanners miss.\n* **Utility:** v1.1.0 groups identical gadgets, so if your primary address has a bad byte, you have all the alternatives right there.\n\nIt’s just a faster, more reliable way to map execution flows without the wait.   \n  \nLet me know if i convinced you.",

      "text": "There is lot of low tier hacker forums and communities. It’s hard to find a place where you can find all the good quality information about hacking. It is such a large field and the knowledge in it is so extensive and specific that there is no forum where you can find everything. There is also no place on the web where you can find guides from A to Z. Also, no one will willingly spend their time and skills for free just so that you can hack someone step by step without any problems.\n\n\n\nhacker forums\n\n\n\nKnowledge should, as always, be derived from books, courses and practice. You need to know a lot of IT topics, such as networks, programming, security, cryptography. Additionally, spend a lot of time in front of the monitor, configuring, analyzing by clicking yourself. And I’m not talking about nights spent playing games ;)\n\n\n\nWithout practice, a theory in IT is just a theory, that you will never be able to use unless you try to do it yourself. This is probably nothing innovative, because it probably applies to every technical specialization. You can watch millions of hours of videos, read hundreds of books and tutorials, but until you sit down and click and solve the problems along the way, you won’t learn anything.\n\n\n\nBecause when you start doing things yourself, you will see that any tutorial, that tells you what to do step by step will not work as described by the author. The world is not perfect and nothing works as it should. If you don’t have a knowledge on some field, next important thing is to be able to find answers quickly and efficiently. That’s when Uncle Google comes to the rescue and a well-asked question. When I stuck somewhere then in most cases I find answer to my problem in Google or on one of the StackExchange sites.\n\n\n\nBelow you will find some links to hacking/cracking/carding forums. Remember to treat them as an additional source of knowledge. Don’t rely on everything you see there. Don’t trust everything you read there and don’t click on everything you can. There are also people who want to exploit your lack of knowledge or trust to e.g. increase their botnet :)\n\n\n\nThese forums are good place for security researchers. You can analyze some leaks, software and read how different people work and what techniques they use. Sometimes in these long forum threads you can find really interesting things.\n\n\n\nNot only in the forum, but in any other community or conversation, be ready to talk about the topic when you ask questions. Show that you’ve already done something about it. You clicked, read, tried to solve the problem but got stuck. Don’t be ignorant and ask general questions or ask for someone to lead you by the hand. Nobody will take you seriously and nobody will help you. If someone offers you a quick cheap solution, know that they are trying to cheat you.\n\n\n\nFocus on questions about an actual problem you have faced. Include details about what you have tried and exactly what you are trying to do. Avoid questions that are primarily opinion-based, or that are likely to generate discussion rather than answers.\n\n\n\n– [stackexchange.com](http://stackexchange.com)\n\n\n\nOk, that’s probably all I wanted to write today. Share with me interesting links to hacker forums or hacker communities you know.\n\n  \nhoek 2020-09-25 2024-09-21",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m excited to share \\*\\*LCSAJdump\\*\\*, a static analysis framework I developed as part of my thesis. It’s designed to discover ROP and JOP gadgets in binaries using a graph-based approach rather than the traditional linear scan.\n\n\\*\\*The Problem:\\*\\* Most ROP scanners (like ROPgadget or Ropper) use a linear sliding-window approach. While fast, they often fail to find \\*\\*\"Shadow Gadgets\"\\*\\*—executable chains that span non-contiguous memory blocks connected by unconditional jumps or conditional branches.\n\n\\*\\*The Solution:\\*\\* LCSAJdump reconstructs the Control-Flow Graph (CFG) using \\*\\*LCSAJ (Linear Code Sequence and Jump)\\*\\* analysis. It models the binary as a directed graph and uses a custom \\*\\*Rainbow BFS\\*\\* algorithm to search backwards from control-flow sinks (\\`ret\\`, \\`jr\\`, etc.), effectively finding complex trampoline chains that bypass bad bytes.\n\n\\*\\*Key Features:\\*\\*\n\n\\* \\*\\*Universal Framework:\\*\\* While it has native, full support for \\*\\*RISC-V 64GC\\*\\* (including compressed instructions), the core engine is architecture-agnostic. You can add support for x86, ARM, or MIPS just by editing \\`config.py\\`.\n\n\\* \\*\\*Graph Reconstruction:\\*\\* Builds a directed graph of Basic Blocks via NetworkX.\n\n\\* \\*\\*Shadow Gadgets:\\*\\* Specifically targets non-contiguous chains hidden from linear views.\n\n\\* \\*\\*Heuristic Scoring:\\*\\* Ranks gadgets based on their utility (register manipulation, side effects).\n\n\\*\\*Installation:\\*\\* It's on PyPI, so you can just run: \\`pip install lcsajdump\\`\n\n\\*\\*Usage:\\*\\* \\`lcsajdump -a riscv64 -d 15 -k 100 my\\_binary\\`\n\nI’d love to get your feedback, especially if anyone is interested in helping extend the architecture profiles for x86/ARM!\n\n\\*\\*Repo:\\*\\* \\[https://github.com/chris1sflaggin/LCSAJdump\\](https://github.com/chris1sflaggin/LCSAJdump)\n\nHappy hacking!",
