As a result, you're essentially computing\n\n    z_{iron} = v_{iron} + noise ||v_{type}||/sqrt(N)\n\nnormalizing v, you're basically computing the actual concept vector for `v_{iron}`, plus noise of O(n^(-1/2)). E.g. if you can provide 100 `iron X` samples, your noise goes down to ~10%.\n\nIf structurally, iron and diamond items have the exact same types (e.g. swords, bars, etc), then the noise term will be structurally similar (same general direction), so `- z_{iron} + z_{diamond}` should be able to cancel the noise out almost perfectly. However, adding/subtracting concepts together without cancellation will amplify the noise, and categories with low # of types to average will have proportionally sqrt(N) times more noise.\n\nIt might be worthwhile to do a few power-iterations on the 2nd-moment operator `M = 1/N \\sum_{type} v_{iron type} v_{iron type}^T` using the mean `z_{iron}` direction to get to the real `v_{iron}` direction (probably converges in just 1-2 steps since the mean `z_{iron}` is already dominated in the `v_{iron}` direction). It's fairly cheap and would allow you to avoid the sqrt(N) noise term.",

If we only had a random sample of half of the iron items and half of the diamond items would it still work well? Cause then we could use it to generate diamond versions of iron pieces we don’t have and vice versa.\n\nIt’s possible I just don’t grasp the use case of VAEs in general and that’s where my confusion comes from.",

If I ask it to generate new items, the quality is meh and I wouldn't be surprised if we did that experiment and asked it to generate something that did not exist in its training data, the VAE would struggle to generate something out of distribution like that. I am definetly making the task easier by trying to generate something that I know was present in the training data.\n\nTake the second example (the one where we turn a gold horse armor to a golden shovel). The fact that the generated shovel is yellow, shows that somewhere in the latent space, color of the object is one of the compressed features it learned to be useful for reconstructing.\n\nUltimately, the essence of the latents is that they are just 32 numbers trying to compress the information of a 3\\*16\\*16 = 768 pixel image. So the VAE has to find the most useful high-level features that characterize each image.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been reviewing the basics for upcoming interviews, and I realized I often get stuck trying to explain simple concepts without using jargon.\n\nI wrote down a summary for the top 10 algorithms to help me memorize them. I figured this might help others here who are just starting out or refreshing their memory.\n\nHere is the list:\n\n# 1. Linear Regression\n\n* **The Gist:** Drawing the straightest possible line through a scatter plot of data points to predict a value (like predicting house prices based on size).\n* **Key Concept:** Minimizing the \"error\" (distance) between the line and the actual data points.\n\n# 2. Logistic Regression\n\n* **The Gist:** Despite the name, it's for **classification**, not regression. It fits an \"S\" shaped curve (Sigmoid) to the data to separate it into two groups (e.g., \"Spam\" vs. \"Not Spam\").\n* **Key Concept:** It outputs a probability between 0 and 1.\n\n# 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n\n* **The Gist:** The \"peer pressure\" algorithm. If you want to know what a new data point is, you look at its 'K' nearest neighbors. If most of them are Blue, the new point is probably Blue.\n* **Key Concept:** It doesn't actually \"learn\" a model; it just memorizes the data (Lazy Learner).\n\n# 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n\n* **The Gist:** Imagine two groups of data on the floor. SVM tries to put a wide street (hyperplane) between them. The goal is to make the street as wide as possible without touching any data points.\n* **Key Concept:** The \"Kernel Trick\" allows it to separate data that isn't easily separable by a straight line by projecting it into higher dimensions.\n\n# 5. Decision Trees\n\n* **The Gist:** A flowchart of questions. \"Is it raining?\" -> Yes -> \"Is it windy?\" -> No -> \"Play Tennis.\" It splits data into smaller and smaller chunks based on simple rules.\n* **Key Concept:** Easy to interpret, but prone to \"overfitting\" (memorizing the data too perfectly).\n\n# 6. Random Forest\n\n* **The Gist:** A democracy of Decision Trees. You build 100 different trees and let them vote on the answer. The majority wins.\n* **Key Concept:** Reduces the risk of errors that a single tree might make (Ensemble Learning).\n\n# 7. K-Means Clustering\n\n* **The Gist:** You have a messy pile of unlabelled data. You want to organize it into 'K' number of piles. The algorithm randomly picks centers for the piles and keeps moving them until the groups make sense.\n* **Key Concept:** Unsupervised learning (we don't know the answers beforehand).\n\n# 8. Naive Bayes\n\n* **The Gist:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. It assumes that all features are independent (which is \"naive\" because in real life, things are usually related).\n* **Key Concept:** Surprisingly good for text classification (like filtering emails).\n\n# 9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n\n* **The Gist:** Data compression. You have a dataset with 50 columns (features), but you only want the 2 or 3 that matter most. PCA combines variables to reduce complexity while keeping the important information.\n* **Key Concept:** Dimensionality Reduction.\n\n# 10. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)\n\n* **The Gist:** Similar to Random Forest, but instead of building trees at the same time, it builds them one by one. Each new tree tries to fix the mistakes of the previous tree.\n* **Key Concept:** Often the winner of Kaggle competitions for tabular data.\n\nIf you want to connect these concepts to real production workflows, one helpful resource is a hands-on course on Machine Learning on Google Cloud. It shows how algorithms like Linear/Logistic Regression, PCA, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting: [Machine Learning on Google Cloud](https://www.netcomlearning.com/course/machine-learning-on-google-cloud)\n\nLet me know if I missed any major ones or if you have a better analogy for them!",

It fits an \"S\" shaped curve (Sigmoid) to the data to separate it into two groups (e.g., \"Spam\" vs. \"Not Spam\").\n\nThis isn't correct: regression is descriptive of the model being fit, classification is one use case for it. It isn't fitting an s-shaped curve directly, the fit is actually linear with respect to the log-odds, not the probability itself. The s-curve arises when you convert the output of the model back to probabilities.\n\nUnderstanding that the output people normally work with \"lives\" in a different space than the model is important if you're interpreting coefficients, or if you want to use a linear model with other types of responses. You can use Poisson/Negative Binomial regression for count data, beta regression for continuous proportions, gamma regression for data that is positive continuous and skewed, etc. All of these (and logistic regression) are types of Generalized Linear Models that differ by the function used to go from the original scale of the data to the scale the model is being fit on. Interestingly enough, this is an avenue for modeling probabilities in alternative ways - you get different shaped s-curves if you use probit, Chauchit, Cloglog functions instead of logit, for example. Not super common but worth knowing about.\n\n>**The Gist:** Data compression. You have a dataset with 50 columns (features), but you only want the 2 or 3 that matter most. PCA combines variables to reduce complexity while keeping the important information.\n\nAlso worth noting that this is just one thing PCA is particularly useful for. What you're doing is making new variables that \"explain\" the variance of the data independently of one another (they're uncorrelated/orthogonal). The first one captures the most variability, the second one captures the most variance in the absence of the first, and so on and so forth. You end up with 50 new columns containing the same information as the original data, but past a certain point they're just capturing the leftovers.\n\nPCA doesn't necessarily reduce complexity (in terms of information) directly, it allows you to cut out as much of it as you can without sacrificing fidelity - past the first few components, the only thing being captured is smaller and smaller chunks of noise. Sort of like discarding pixels in a region of an image that appears purely black to the naked eye and probably only differs due to camera sensor noise - you could use interpolation to reconstruct most of them and nobody would be the wiser. Note: a fun idea to play with here is to actually use PCA for compression. You can start with a dataset that has a column for each color channel and a row for each pixel, and then see what happens if you start pooling information for nearby pixels. \n\nComplexity is also reduced in a practical sensed because correlated variables end up getting decomposed into variables that contain shared and unique information. If they're highly correlated, that unique information isn't contributing much and may end up getting discarded - you're effectively collapsing dimensions.",

They had the impression that \"applied statistics\" was more about applying statistics to things, but the program was 90% derivations and proofs. The distinction is in what kind of theory is used and how: you need statistical theory to learn how the things people use work, which requires a fair bit of math. If you want to do academic research, this shifts to learning how the theory itself works.  \n\nAll of that is to say that if you want to get serious about building things with ML, approach it like engineering. Engineers need to take physics because their work depends on understanding it, but they don't need to understand it at the level of a physicist. For ML that might like being able to reason quantitatively about the tools you're using - you don't need to study the theory of optimization super deeply, but you should have an understanding of optimization as it pertains to what you're working with.",

CNNs made sense once I understood basic image processing ideas. Autoencoders clicked as compression + reconstruction. Even time series models felt intuitive once I framed them as structured sequences with locality and dependency over time.\n\nBut RNNs? They’ve been uniquely hard in a way nothing else has been.\n\nIt’s not that the math is incomprehensible, or that I don’t understand sequences. I *do*. I understand sliding windows, autoregressive models, sequence-to-sequence setups, and I’ve even built LSTM-based projects before without fully “getting” what was going on internally.\n\nWhat trips me up is that RNNs don’t give me a stable mental model. The hidden state feels fundamentally opaque i.e. it's not like a feature map or a signal transformation, but a compressed, evolving internal memory whose semantics I can’t easily reason about. Every explanation feels syntactically different, but conceptually slippery in the same way.",

I think a natural progression to build up your intuition regarding latent-state models is to start with Discrete-time Hidden Markov Models, which are very easy to intuit.\n\nThe problem is that HMMs are inefficient in high dimensions. Factorial HMMs improve this by distributing the state into multiple binary variables, but this makes inference much more expensive to calculate. Intuitively, the fix is to move to Linear Dynamical Systems, where the state vectors are now continuous rather than discrete (think Kalman Filters, if you're familiar). This solves the representation problem, but now you have a linearity issue because you can only model simple curves. How do we fix that? We take the Linear Dynamical System and wrap the transition in a non-linear activation function. That is effectively an RNN.\n\nThere's a lot of nuance missing here and I've been a bit handwavey (it's not intended to fix your intuition) but I think there's value in studying what came before RNN's and building your intuition up from there, particularly in relation to what actually is actually going on in latent space, and what that represents. I'm unsure how helpful this is if you're not particularly interested in the theory, and just want some intuition. But I think the intuition comes from the theory, and seeing how it progresses.",

With deep neural networks, overfitting is not a feature. It is a bug.\n\nMedium Link for better readability: [https://vizuara.medium.com/an-introduction-to-physics-informed-neural-networks-pinns-teach-your-neural-network-to-respect-af484ac650fc](https://vizuara.medium.com/an-introduction-to-physics-informed-neural-networks-pinns-teach-your-neural-network-to-respect-af484ac650fc)\n\nLet us consider a hypothetical set of experiments. You throw a ball up (or at an angle), and note down the height of the ball at different points of time.\n\nWhen you plot the height v/s time, you will see something like this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b9byjx62pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=22aebc098ad30d2b18505fcaa3d80cf61777f2b5\n\nIt is easy to train a neural network on this dataset so that you can predict the height of the ball even at time points where you did not note down the height in your experiments.\n\nFirst, let us discuss how this training is done.\n\n# Training a regular neural network\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/732wrp23pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c65e4fc46e3a8fd8fcac281361ece4328932f2b\n\nYou can construct a neural network with few or multiple hidden layers. The input is time (t) and the output predicted by the neural network is height of the ball (h).\n\nThe neural network will be initialized with random weights. This means the predictions of h(t) made by the neural network will be very bad initially as shown in the image below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdgeu9s4pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e97b932fe7bef937f45716295435c7d50c0212f\n\nWe need to penalize the neural network for making these bad predictions right? How do we do that? In the form of loss functions.\n\nLoss of a neural network is a measure of how bad its predictions are compared the real data. The close the predictions and data, the lower the loss.\n\nA singular goal of neural network training is to minimize the loss.\n\nSo how can we define the loss here? Consider the 3 options below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/slcx6y27pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcccb9ec6c9aac8b976b71ae5a7f7f6dfd481c24\n\nIn all the 3 options, you are finding the average of some kind of loss.\n\n* **Option 1 is not good** because positive and negative errors will cancel each other.\n* **Option 2 is okay** because we are taking the absolute value of errors, but the problem is modulus function is not differentiable at x=0.\n* **Option 3 is the best**. It is a square function which means individual errors are converted to positive numbers and the function is differentiable. This is the famous Mean Squared Error (MSE). You are taking the mean value of the square of all individual errors.\n\nHere error means the difference between actual value and predicted value.\n\nMean Squared Error is minimum when the predictions are very close to the experimental data as shown in the figure below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwm6mxq8pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=33983e165ecec1efca3a973e97b3d28aa2a89782\n\nBut there is a problem with this approach. What if your experimental data was not good? In the image below you can see that one of the data points is not following the trend shown by the rest of the dataset.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mswknvl9pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=71546cc05f741175a11e486ae3fe6a77c44b82e7\n\nThere can be multiple reasons due to which such data points show up in the data.\n\n1. You did not perform the experiments well. You made a manual mistake while noting the height.\n2. The sensor or instrument using which you were making the height measurement was faulty.\n3. A sudden gush of wind caused a sudden jump in the height of the ball.\n\nThere could be many possibilities that results in outliers and noise in a dataset.\n\nKnowing that real life data may have noise and outliers, it will not be wise if we train a neural network to exactly mimic this dataset. It results in something called as overfitting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1e7r509apwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3269c58b8ca9e873945ca9970aafac78bc53279\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l0fgrzrapwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=28acb46d2af8e6398876ee107b7900e860061904\n\nIn the figure above, mean squared error will be low in both cases. However in one case neural network is fitting on outlier also, which is not good. So what should we do?\n\n# Bring physics into the picture\n\nIf you are throwing a ball and observing its physics, then you already have some knowledge about the trajectory of the ball, based on Newton’s laws of motion.\n\nSure, you may be making simplifications by assuming that the effect of wind or air drag or buoyancy are negligible. But that does not take away from the fact that you already have decent knowledge about this system even in the absence of a trained neural network.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8cudgx0epwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=9efaf22e50525030c0ceaa9995b0afe96a26c79d\n\nThe physics you assume may not be in perfect agreement with the experimental data as shown above, but it makes sense to think that the experiments will not deviate too much from physics.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fpy7q3oepwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5ff5cacaf8b8d2895139589897c6dd3d670be9\n\nSo if one of your experimental data points deviate too much from what physics says, there is probably something wrong with that data point. So how can you let you neural network take care of this?\n\n# How can you teach physics to neural networks?\n\nIf you want to teach physics to neural network, then you have to somehow incentivize neural network to make predictions closer to what is suggested by physics.\n\nIf the neural network makes a prediction where the height of the ball is far away from the purple dotted line, then loss should increase.\n\nIf the predictions are closer to the dotted line, then the loss should be minimum.\n\nWhat does this mean? Modify the loss function.\n\nHow can you modify the loss function such that the loss is high when predictions deviate from physics? And how does this enable the neural network make more physically sensible predictions? **Enter PINN Physics Informed Neural Network.**  \n  \nPhysics Informed Neural Network (PINN)\n\nThe goal of PINNs is to solve (*or learn solutions to*) differential equations by embedding the known physics (or governing differential equations) directly into the neural network’s training objective (loss function).\n\nThe idea of PINNs were introduced in this seminal paper by Maziar Raissi et. al.: [https://maziarraissi.github.io/PINNs/](https://maziarraissi.github.io/PINNs/)\n\nThe basic idea in PINN is to have a neural network is trained to minimize a loss function that includes:\n\n1. A **data mismatch** term (*if observational data are available*).\n2. A **physics loss** term enforcing the differential equation itself (and initial/boundary conditions).\n\n# Let us implement PINN on our example\n\nLet us look at what we know about our example. When a ball is thrown up, it trajectory h(t) varies according to the following ordinary differential equation (ODE).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vacsz6dlpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=14111c810dba1e861fbcc71a1bf8d920e479448c\n\nHowever this ODE alone cannot fully describe h(t) uniquely. You also need an initial condition. Mathematically this is because to solve a first-order differential equation in time, you need 1 initial condition.\n\nLogically, to know height as a function of time, you need to know the starting height from which the ball was thrown. Look at the image below. In both cases, the balls are thrown at the exact same time with the exact same initial velocity component in the vertical direction. But the h(t) depends on the initial height. So you need to know h(t=0) for fully describing the height of the ball as a function of time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eobv9u1mpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=a28a6c8584f37683f703b4c72a5a8f436353dedc\n\nThis means it is not enough to make the neural network make accurate predictions on dh/dt, the neural network should also make accurate prediction on h(t=0) for fully matching the physics in this case.\n\n# Loss due to dh/dt (ODE loss)\n\nWe know the expected dh/dt because we know the initial velocity and acceleration due to gravity.\n\nHow do we get the dh/dt predicted by the neural network? After all it is predicting height h, not velocity v or dh/dt. The answer is **Automatic differentiation (AD).**\n\nBecause most machine‐learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX) support automatic differentiation, you can compute dh/dt by differentiating the neural network.\n\nThus, we have a predicted dh/dt (from the neural network differentiation) for every experimental time points, and we have an actual dh/dt based on the physics.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/msf6gyunpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=1392d9e60f5ee011a480392af07e05bc5d094492\n\nNow we can define a loss due to the difference between predicted and physics-based dh/dt.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/68xl4xpopwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b9a727be489bd8736e8ffc235f49fca5dc25b9a\n\nMinimizing this loss (which I prefer to call ODE loss) is a good thing to ensure that neural network learns the ODE. But that is not enough. We need to make the neural network follow the initial condition also. That brings us to the next loss term.Initial condition loss\n\n# Initial condition loss\n\nThis is easy. You know the initial condition. You make the neural network make a prediction of height for t=0. See how far off the prediction is from the reality. You can construct a squared error which can be called as the *Initial Condition Loss.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4u4syj1qpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=591b7e0f46ebf32024533c9d727042a889c3007d\n\nSo is that it? You have ODE loss and Initial condition loss. Is it enough that the neural network tries to minimize these 2 losses? What about the experimental data? There are 3 things to consider.\n\n1. You cannot throw away the experimental data.\n2. You cannot neglect the physics described by the ODEs or PDEs.\n3. You cannot neglect the initial and/or boundary conditions.\n\nThus you have to also consider the data-based mean squared error loss along with ODE loss and Initial condition loss.\n\n# The modified loss term\n\nThe simple mean squared error based loss term can now be modified like below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2xc18prpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=95fabc8b54b2b291292d6ab2c15f5810c13379ce\n\nIf there are boundary conditions in addition to initial conditions, you can add an additional term based on the difference between predicted boundary conditions and actual boundary conditions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezh3in7spwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=70367e6fbb1aa6e7924d93da8ff3b0ce8898419d\n\nHere the Data loss term ensures that the predictions are not too far from the experimental data points.\n\nThe *ODE loss term* \\+ the *initial condition loss term* ensures that the predictions are not too far from what described by the physics.\n\nIf you are pretty sure about the physics the you can set λ1 to zero. In the ball throwing experiment, you will be sure about the physics described by our ODE if air drag, wind, buoyancy and any other factors are ignored. Only gravity is present. And in such cases, the PINN effectively becomes an ODE solver.\n\nHowever, for real life cases where only part of the physics is known or if you are not fully sure of the ODE, then you retain λ1 and other λ terms in the net loss term. That way you force the neural network to respect physics as well as the experimental data. This also suppress the effects of experimental noise and outliers.\n\n>",

One way to reduce the overwhelm is to start by stripping the problem down to the smallest version that would still be useful, even if it feels almost trivial.

      "text": "I've spent the last few weeks building a GPT-style LLM entirely from scratch in PyTorch to understand the architecture. This isn't just a wrapper; it's a full implementation covering the entire lifecycle from tokenization to instruction fine-tuning.\n\nI have followed Sebastian Raschka's 'Build a LLM from Scratch' book for the implementation, here is the breakdown of the repo:\n\n**1. Data & Tokenization (**`src/data.py`**)** Instead of using pre-built tokenizers, I implemented:\n\n* `SimpleTokenizerV2`: Handles regex-based splitting and special tokens (`<|endoftext|>`, `<|unk|>`).\n* `GPTDatasetV1`: A sliding-window dataset implementation for efficient autoregressive training.\n\n**2. The Attention Mechanism (**`src/attention.py`**)**\n\nI manually implemented `MultiHeadAttention` to understand the tensor math:\n\n* Handles the query/key/value projections and splitting heads.\n* Implements the **Causal Mask** (using `register_buffer`) to prevent the model from \"cheating\" by seeing future tokens.\n* Includes `SpatialDropout` and scaled dot-product attention.\n\n**3. The GPT Architecture (**`src/model.py`**)** A complete 124M parameter model assembly:\n\n* Combines `TransformerBlock`, `LayerNorm`, and `GELU` activations.\n* Features positional embeddings and residual connections exactly matching the GPT-2 spec.\n\n**4. Training & Generation (**`src/train.py`**)**\n\n* Custom training loop with loss visualization.\n* Implements `generate()` with **Top-K sampling** and **Temperature scaling** to control output creativity.\n\n**5. Fine-tuning:**\n\n* **Classification (**`src/finetune_classification.py`**):** Adapted the backbone to detect Spam/Ham messages (90%+ accuracy on the test set).\n* **Instruction Tuning (**`src/finetune_instructions.py`**):** Implemented an Alpaca-style training loop. The model can now handle instruction-response pairs rather than just completing text.\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/Nikshaan/llm-from-scratch](https://github.com/Nikshaan/llm-from-scratch)\n\nI’ve tried to comment every shape transformation in the code.

Since 2024, I've been working at a startup as a software development intern, and almost a year ago I was promoted to Junior ML/AI.\n\nI have two questions. First, why haven't I been working for months? I'm still getting paid because it's a small startup, and the person in charge of me is always busy, so no matter how many projects I ask or how much they promise me, I haven't received any since august. Supposedly, we're supposed to have our first in-person meeting on Monday after almost two years working there.\n\nIn the few projects I've worked on, my boss saw potential in me for AI/ML, but since I started university, I've always planned to work in web development, so my actual knowledge of AI/ML is limited, and it wasn't even something I had considered working in.\n\nI recently got access to a Udemy account and even bought some O'Reilly books on Humble Bundle. Is that enough? Is there a practical roadmap?I don't expect to learn it all in just a few months or week, but I do want to start exploring this field. I want to know what to expect and what skills are most in demand for junior professionals these days.\n\nI also hope to be able to change jobs eventually because, although this is a comfortable job, I want to advance and learn in my career. Unfortunately, in my contry there aren't many opportunities for entry-level positions, only for more advanced engineers (I'm not from the USA).\n\nI really want to learn because I HATE doing things poorly or half-heartedly, and I also don't want to pass up the opportunity to learn in this area even though it wasn't what I was looking for.",

In practice, most ML engineers spend far more time waiting on data, clarifying vague goals, or being blocked by infra and priorities than training models. That is often why you are idle, not because you are doing something wrong. Courses and books are useful, but they only stick once you are trying to solve a concrete problem end to end, even a small one, with messy data and unclear success criteria. The skills that actually matter early on are solid software fundamentals, data handling, and understanding why a model breaks in production, not knowing every algorithm.

      "text": "Let us start with a simple example. Imagine that you have collected handwriting samples from all the students in your class (100). Let us say that they have written the word “Hello.”\n\nNow, students will write the word “hello” in many different ways. Some of them will write words which are more slanted towards the left. Some of them will write words which are slanted towards the right.\n\nSome words will be neat, some words will be messy. Here are some of the samples of the words “hello”.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i90ibqodpqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=7aa01508bec1e042075668367a1d4fca9f0d3524\n\nNow, let us say that someone comes to you and asks,\n\n“Generate a machine which can produce samples of handwriting for the word ‘hello’ written by students of your class.”\n\n**HOW WILL YOU SOLVE THIS PROBLEM?**\n\nMedium Link for better readability: [https://vizuara.medium.com/variational-autoencoders-explained-from-scratch-365fa5b75b0d)\n\n# Part 1\n\nThe first thing that will come to your mind is: What are the hidden factors that determine the handwriting style?\n\nEach student’s handwriting depends on many hidden characteristics:\n\n* How much pressure they apply?\n* Whether they write slanted\n* Whether their letters are wide or narrow\n* How fast they write?\n* How neat they are?\n\nThese are not directly seen in the final image, but they definitely cause the shape of the letters.\n\nIn other words, every handwriting has a secret recipe that determines the final shape of the handwriting.\n\nFor example, this person writes slightly tilted, thin strokes, medium speed, moderate neatness.\n\nSo, the general architecture of the machine looks as follows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uqgc9oghpqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f778396417bd47a7683bbb4feb340f038eafb44\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nThis secret recipe is something which is called as the latent variable. Latent variables are the hidden factors that determine the handwriting style.\n\nThese variables are denoted by the symbol “z”.\n\nThe latent variables (z) captures the essence of how the handwriting was formed.\n\nLet us try to understand the latent variables for the handwriting example.\n\nLet us assume that we have two latent variables:\n\n1. One which captures the slantness\n2. One which captures the neatness of the handwriting\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tu14neiipqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d895eec9ce079ac406920f723f7a6fe9ccad5aa\n\nFrom the above graph, you can see that both axes carry some meaning.\n\n* Words which are on the right-hand side are more slanted towards the right\n* Words which are on the left-hand side are more slanted towards the left\n\nAlso, words which are on the top or down are very messy.\n\nSo, we can see that every single point on this plane corresponds to a specific style of handwriting.\n\nIn reality, the distribution for all 100 students in your class might look as follows.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfju2oljpqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebb517fe7261df811317527a668ab8b0f52fdd49\n\nWe observe that each handwriting image is compressed into just two numbers: slant and neatness.\n\nSimilar handwritings end up as nearby points in this 2D latent space.\n\nNow, let us feed this to our machine which generates the handwriting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/duk9bj5lpqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6b29ee897e8bd876b47cab0f4ed4d59f5a31276\n\nThere is another word for this machine, which is called the “decoder”\n\nSo far, we have just used the word “decoder” to generate samples from the latent variables, but what is this decoder exactly and how are the samples generated?\n\n**Let us say, instead of generating handwriting samples our task is to generate handwritten digits.**\n\nAgain, we start with the same thinking process. What are the hidden factors that determine the shape of the handwritten digits?\n\nAnd we create a latent space with the latent variables.\n\nJust as before, let us assume that there are two latent variables.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pgvrsjfopqeg1.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=e00ae9db48af29d0563e76976594decfd37899ee\n\nNow let’s assume that we have chosen a point in the latent space which corresponds to the number 5.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g0em62kqpqeg1.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&s=04e8e663e9afed4aed792428f8d11c6315e603a6\n\nThe main question is, how do we generate the actual sample for the digit 5 once we pass this to the decoder?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k18g411spqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=997c8681401708c100d9959bd1d645eb011f6e12\n\nFirst, let us begin by dividing the image of the digit 5 into a bunch of pixels like follows.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ec37v2xspqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=80c1e30b206f38accfbee5d8267b4c5dad939533\n\nEach pixel corresponds to a number. For example, white pixels correspond to 1 and black pixels correspond to 0.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fcbhf81upqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8957b407a7d13e51646abee20b7c4830d4d527f\n\nSo it looks like all we have to do is output a number, either 0 or 1, at the appropriate location so that we get the shape 5.\n\nHowever, there is one drawback of this approach: with this approach, we will get a fixed shape 5 every time. We will not get variations of it.\n\nBut we do want to get variations of number 5. Remember in all the image generation applications, in the same prompt, we can get different variations of the image? We want exactly that.\n\nSo instead of outputting a single number, what if you could output a probability density?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18mvsurvpqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1214ddcd3b371a0400ec712baec4d8d3cfde335\n\nSo, the actual value of the pixel intensity becomes the mean, and we add a small standard deviation to it.\n\nLet us look at a simple visualization to understand this better.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IztgtOYgZgE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IztgtOYgZgE)\n\n# Part 2:\n\nOkay, we have covered one part of the story which explains the decoder.\n\nNow let’s cover the second part so that we get a complete picture.\n\nIf you paid close attention to the first part, you will understand that we have made a major assumption.\n\nRemember when we talked about the handwritten digit 5, we said that let us assume that this part of the latent space corresponds to the digit 5.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vla67zsxpqeg1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=08e36f62b1fd6d928aede990b90edbab11761684\n\nBut how do we know this information beforehand?\n\nHow do we know which part of the latent space to access to generate the digit 5?\n\nOne option is to access all possible points in the latent space, generate an image for it using our decoder distribution, and see which images match closely to the digit 5.\n\nBut this does not make sense. This is completely intractable and not a practical solution.\n\nWouldn’t it be better if we knew which part of the latent space to access for the type of image we want to generate?\n\nLet us see if we build another machine to do that.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9f6haczpqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c1da3b91e9bf2bbf80442d03b7d80b5f8e572c9\n\nIf we do this, we can connect both these machines together.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4jtasza0qqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f1200708e63063df1297d9db0c3f3fa547343e8\n\nThis “machine” is also called as the encoder\n\nHave a look at the video below, which explains visually why the encoder is necessary. It also explains where the word “Variational” in “Variational Autoencoders” comes from.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u9mrcig1qqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b362cfa2714602bf1dc0ae619fa5adb5018600\n\nThese two stories put together form the “Variational Autoencoder”\n\nBefore we understand how to train the variation auto-encoder, let us understand some mathematics:\n\n# Formal Representation for VAEs\n\nIn VAEs we distinguish between two types of variables:\n\nObserved variables (x), which correspond to the data we see, and latent variables (z) (which capture the hidden factors of variation).\n\nThe decoder distribution is denoted as follows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qjfndijqqeg1.png?width=56&format=png&auto=webp&s=06e19c83a76f06e49994cf20c7f7eee986b0f1ea\n\nThe notation reads: Probability of x given z.\n\nThe encoder distribution is denoted as follows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvm3o0tlqqeg1.png?width=52&format=png&auto=webp&s=dce09ec13a40e4db5d973977dd1de5a0afbea342\n\n[](https://medium.com/plans?source=upgrade_membership---post_li_non_moc_upsell--365fa5b75b0d---------------------------------------)\n\nThe notation reads: Probability of z given x.\n\nThe schematic representation for the variational autoencoder can be drawn as follows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjskkb0nqqeg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=35f3c2eebd0beefad9933ba1f692aea6cce41da4\n\n# Training of VAEs\n\nFrom the above diagram, we immediately see that there are two neural networks: the encoder and decoder, which we have to train.\n\nThe critical question is, what is the objective function that we want to optimize in this scenario?\n\nLet us think from first principles. We started off with the objective that we want our probability distribution to match the true probability distribution of the underlying data.\n\nThis means that we want to maximize the following:\n\nThis makes sense because, if the probability of drawing the real samples from our predicted distribution is high, we have done a good job in modeling the true distribution.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m33qnqioqqeg1.png?width=42&format=png&auto=webp&s=15bb9920b6ed9afef44e83bb7fb10333d65ac282\n\nBut how do we calculate the above probability?\n\nOkay, let us start by using the following formula:\n\nWe have looked at the same analogy in the visual animation which we saw before.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kpf4fjspqqeg1.png?width=187&format=png&auto=webp&s=81df2a681c502c549706eea5b1ffaacd46188278\n\nIt essentially means that we look at all possible variations in the hidden factors and sum over all the probabilities over all these hidden factors.\n\nHowever, this is mathematically intractable.\n\nHow can we possibly go over every single point in the latent space and find out the probability of the sample drawn from that point being real?\n\nThis does not even make use of the encoder.\n\nSo now we need a computable training objective.\n\n# Training via the Evidence Lower Bound\n\nHave a look at the video below:\n\nThe idea is to find a term which is always less than the true objective, so if we maximize this term, our true objective also will be maximized.\n\nThe evidence lower bound is made up of two terms given below.\n\n**Note from my side: Ahh, it’s been too long and I’m not able to add more images. It’s saying “unable to add more than 20 images”. I think that’s the limit. It would be great if you could go through the blog itself:** [https://vizuara.medium.com/variational-autoencoders-explained-from-scratch-365fa5b75b0d](https://vizuara.medium.com/variational-autoencoders-explained-from-scratch-365fa5b75b0d)\n\n**Term 1: The Reconstruction Term**\n\nThis term essentially says that the reconstructed output should be similar to the original input. It’s quite intuitive.\n\n**Term 2: The Regularization Term**\n\nThis term encourages the encoder distribution to stay as close as possible to the assumed distribution of the latent variables, which is quite commonly a Gaussian distribution.\n\nThe reason why the latent space is assumed to be Gaussian in my opinion is that we assume that all real-world processes have variables which have a typical value and they have extremes where the probability is generally less.\n\n# Practical example\n\nLet us take a real-life example to understand how the ELBO is used to train a Variational AutoEncoder.\n\nOur task is to train a variation autoencoder to predict the true distribution that generates MNIST handwritten digits and generate samples from that distribution.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nFirst, let us start by understanding how we will set up our decoder. Remember our decoder setup looks as follows:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nThe decoder is a distribution which maps from the latent space to the input image space.\n\nFor every single pixel, the decoder should give as an output the mean and the variance of the probability distribution for that pixel.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nHence, the decoder neural network should do the following:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nWe use the following decoder network architecture:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nOkay, now we have the decoder architecture in place, but remember we need the second part of the story, which is the encoder as well.\n\nOur encoder process looks something as follows:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nThe encoder tells us which areas of the latent space the input maps to. However, the output is not given as a single point;\n\nIt is given as a distribution in the latent space.\n\nFor example, the image 3 might map onto the following region in the latent space.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nHence, the encoder neural network should do the following:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nWe use the following encoder architecture:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nThe overall encoder-decoder architecture looks as follows:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nNow, let us understand how the ELBO loss is defined.\n\nRemember the ELBO loss is made up of two terms:\n\n1. The Reconstruction term\n2. The Regularization term\n\nFirst, let us understand the reconstruction loss.\n\nThe goal of the reconstruction loss is to make the output image look exactly the same as the input image.\n\nThis compares every pixel of the input with the output. If the original pixel is black and the VAE predicts white, the penalty is huge. If the VAE predicts correctly, the penalty is low.\n\nHence, the reconstruction loss is simply written as the binary cross-entropy loss between the true image and the predicted image.\n\nNow, let us understand the KL-Divergence Loss:\n\nThe objective of the KL divergence loss is to make sure that the latent space distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\nTo ensure that the mean is zero, we add a penalty if the mean deviates from zero. The penalty looks as follows:\n\nSimilarly, if the standard deviation is huge, the model is penalized for being too messy. Also, if the standard deviation is tiny, then also the model is penalized for being too specific.\n\nThe Penalty looks as follows:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nHere is the Google Colab Notebook which you can use for training: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18A4ApqBHv3-1K0k8rSe2rVOQ5viNpqA8?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18A4ApqBHv3-1K0k8rSe2rVOQ5viNpqA8?usp=sharing)\n\n# Training the VAE on MNIST Dataset:\n\nLet us first visualize how the latent space distribution varies with the iterations. Because of the regularization term, both distributions tend to move towards the Gaussian distribution centered around the mean of 0 and the variance of 1.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nWhen categorized according to the digits, the latent space looks as follows:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nSee the quality of the Reconstructions:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nSampling from the latent space:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n# Drawbacks of Standard VAE\n\nDespite the theoretical appeal of the VAE framework, it suffers from a critical drawback: it often produces blurry outputs.\n\nThe VAE framework poses unique challenges in the training methodology:\n\nBecause the encoder and decoder must be optimized jointly, learning becomes unstable.\n\nNext, we will study diffusion models which effectively sidestep this central weakness.\n\nThanks!\n\nIf you like this content, please check out our research bootcamps on the following topics:\n\n**GenAI**: [https://flyvidesh.online/gen-ai-professional-bootcamp](https://flyvidesh.online/gen-ai-professional-bootcamp)\n\n**RL**: [https://rlresearcherbootcamp.vizuara.ai/](https://rlresearcherbootcamp.vizuara.ai/)\n\n**SciML**: [https://flyvidesh.online/ml-bootcamp](https://flyvidesh.online/ml-bootcamp)\n\n**ML-DL**: [https://flyvidesh.online/ml-dl-bootcamp](https://flyvidesh.online/ml-dl-bootcamp)\n\n**CV**: [https://cvresearchbootcamp.vizuara.ai/](https://cvresearchbootcamp.vizuara.ai/)\n\n[](https://medium.com/tag/variational-autoencoder?source=post_page-----365fa5b75b0d---------------------------------------)",
