Have you explored this bit? Any thoughts on potentially replacing geopandas with other tools/libraries? \n\nFinally, congrats!

But, the very initial ideas (and passion) cannot be generated by AI.\n\nFor the scalability, it will support GraphQL-based solution in the future, like neo4j.

There are some things that give a 'rough around the edges\" feel. \n\nWhen you enter a problem, there is a left and right panel. Right has the code, and left has some interactive widgets mixed into markdown (mdx?). The markdown is not very well styled. The sizes of the fonts in the widgets and even in equations is noticeably larger than in the rendered markdown text. I would suggest making the font size larger for the explanatory text (markdown text). Indentation is lacking. \n\nJust off the bat, here is some things I would do:\n\n- Increase font size a tiny bit for the content (not the widget)\n\n- Change the `p-4` in `p-4 overflow-auto text-sm leading-6 text-zinc-200 flex-1` to `p-8`. Or better yet, set `max-w` on the content to be better suited to the font size. <- The latter would be better for wide and less wide screens (than changing padding).  \n\n- Change the padding of the panel header (tabs) to match: `px-4` -> `px-8` or set max-w to be the same as the header \n\n- Make the `:r1u:` data panel have scrollbars that are styled the same as the scrollbar for the code editor in the right panel.  \n\n- Increase margins for markdown block elements (lists, quote, etc).  \n\n- Increase left & right padding for code blocks (`<pre>` elements)\n\nWidgets look great!\n\nAs far as content goes, my only suggestion is to start users off in a intro/starting page when they go to the ML Research and ML Math page. It could give you the opportunity to give some general background, at timeline of these papers, a suggested/recommended path for the users to follow, etc.\n\nLastly, I dont know if its just on my end, but I am getting a bunch of errors in the console. App still seems to work though!\n\nThis is an amazing effort! And a killer resource.",

Would go after diff eqs + calc, def before any analysis classes.\n\n- DS&A should go after Linear algebra, sooner rather than later. Ideally in Python. \n\n- Stats should be way earlier. Would put after calc, diff eqs and higher math. Would also add Bayesian stats or stochastics after stats.\n\n- I’d add regression after linear algebra/ calc and before ML.\n\n- ML shouldn’t be until after the stats and regression classes if you add them\n\n- i don’t think you need a whole ML theory class. I think you’ll get enough on that between regular ML, DL, RL and all the stats leading up to it. \n\n- I took real analysis then numerical analysis after higher math. I never took complex analysis, abstract algebra or topology, but since you have RA at the bottom, Id consult a pure math person about ordering those. \n\n- I never took CV and I didnt need it for NLP. So I think you can move NLP up if you’d like.\n\n- everything below reinforcement I think is overkill, a reasonably up to date NLP class should cover what you need to know there. \n\n- I think Reinforcement could be moved up to around Deep Learning. I never took pure RL so idk how involved neural nets are, but I didn’t need more than the jist of RL for NLP. That might depend on if the ML class touches on RL or not. \n\nJust my opinions from my undergrad + grad experience",

Usually, you have spivak -> abbott -> rudin--though as a matter of taste, I would use tao rather than abbott. Complex analysis isn't really necessary for ML, but if you want the completeness, you should be putting it after real analysis, despite it being \"more well-behaved\". I would also recommend splitting up the algebra sequence, with at least something like \"A First Course in Abstract Algebra\" by John B. Fraleigh before D&F.\n\nYou will want to at least have gone through abbott + most of D&F before starting topology, as it builds the motivation (and covers the basics) for point-set topology.\n\nStats should be handled much earlier... and I recommend prefacing it with some kind probabilities work.\n\nLastly, I'm not sure how much CS background you have, but if it's not a lot, I recommend more CS groundwork before diving straight into ML.

I offered you very generic advice on how to convince people your model generalizes on unseen data. That’s as far as it goes. You can interpret what you have in whatever way you want. You won’t convince anybody it works if you aren’t willing to do it. You also don’t have to do it, we don’t care. But you’re coming across as disingenuous because you asked for feedback and then rejected all of it. You’re not going to get very far in a career in data science if you can’t take criticism.

Some other applications are less exciting because they have the potential to be misused. Tbf anything has the potential to be misused, but some more than others. Deep fakes is one of those things. This is not to say that the technology behind it (the maths and the engineering) is not exciting. It is!

Learn the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning and get comfortable with the idea of features, labels, training, and testing. At the same time, refresh Python basics you’ll use all the time in ML, especially NumPy and pandas. Try loading a dataset, cleaning it, and doing some simple exploration.\n\nIn week two, start with your first real models. Learn linear regression and logistic regression and implement them using scikit-learn. Don’t worry about the math being perfect, just understand what the model is trying to do and how to evaluate it. Work with a small dataset and focus on things like train/test split, accuracy, and mean squared error.\n\nWeek three, classic machine learning algorithms. Learn decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests. This is where ideas like overfitting and bias vs variance start to make sense. Try changing model parameters and see how performance changes. This experimentation is more important than memorizing formulas.\n\nIn the fourth week, put everything together in a small project. Take a dataset from Kaggle and go end to end: clean the data, choose a model, train it, evaluate it, and explain your results in plain language. Even a simple project here will boost your confidence a lot.\n\nBy the end of the month, you won’t be an expert, but you’ll actually understand how machine learning works and how to build models. From there, you can decide whether to go deeper into math, try deep learning, or focus on more projects.",

But if what Claude tells me is true, then can we really claim that attention is all that is important? Shouldn't it be \"attention - combined with FFN, add & norm, multi-head concat, linear projection and everything else - is all you need?\"\n\nIs there more recent work that tries to justify these architectural details? Or should I just give up trying to find the answer?\n\n",

Also it breaks down the objective of each component also. It starts from a compressed sensing objective and ultimately derives the Attention equation (with Q = K). I mostly work around Image and audio signals so this explanation to attention mechanism gives me a better \"signal friendly\" intuition to why Attention is always the go to for SOTA results on my data, where the token as such is not as discrete or interpretable like a  word token in language.",

In fact, removing the attention makes the transformer very similar to a parallel MLP. Softmax is used almost everywhere in ML since it produces outputs that sum to 1, a property of probabilities.\n\nBefore transformers we had RNNs like GRUs, LSTMs, but they had vanishing/exploding gradient problems and couldn't learn over long horizons. Memory cells were good, but it meant you need to get through thousands of tokens to remember what happened before. In addition, LSTMs were not very parallellizable because you had to do backprop through time, meaning you need to process previous token before you can process current one.\n\nLatest innovation in RNNs was using attention to close some of these gaps. These models started outperforming the pure LSTM/GRU models and were gaining traction. The paper is called \"Attention is all you need\" because they proposed that the memory layers were not necessary. Giving them up and having only attention and linear layers meant 1) More stable learning due to attention outperforming memory cells 2) parallellizable in both training and in inference.\n\nYou correctly pointed out that a lot of those decisions are empirical. Theory might suggest one thing, but we'll probably go with what works better. Look at the pre-norm and post-norm debate. There's also papers explaining these, but I'm not sure whether there is one that explains all. There's usually deep dive papers that try to explain these with other tools. It could be training stability, gradient flow etc.",

          "text": "The reason behind the concatenation a more computationally efficient way to do matrix addition. I'm sure you are familiar with how attention works where the output is equivalent to softmax(QK\\^T/\\\\sqrt(d\\_k))\\*V. Now originally, you would add this to the residual stream. However, researchers realized there were two things that made this naive way more computationally expensive. \n\nFirst, the QK attention scores are typically in the form nxn (where n is sequence length). This would need to be multiplied by a matrix V, which projected nxn matrix back into a matrix of nxd\\_embed to match the dimension of its input. However, this meant that the V matrix needed to be of size nxd\\_embed. Remember that the V matrix is created by multiplying the inputs x in the form n x d\\_embed by a corresponding learned weight matrix commonly dubbed W\\_v. This W\\_v matrix would, therefore, need to be d\\_embed x d\\_embed. The original authors, I believe, planned thinking that embedding dimension might be parameter set very large in the future. For instance, GPT3's embedding dimension is around 12288 long. Therefore, the W\\_v matrix in the naive way would be 12288x12288, which is massive for each head. They realized that they didn't actually need this many parameters and also storing this massive matrix 96 times(the amount of heads GPT3 would eventually have) is prohibitively expensive. The original authors likely foresaw this and factorized the W\\_v matrix into two lower rank forms. The first matrix commonly retains the name W\\_v(the matrix first multiplied to input x that projects it down to some smaller dimension, say 128). The second matrix is now typically called W\\_o (the matrix that is multiplied to the output of x\\*W\\_v that converts it from an nx128 matrix into an nxd\\_embed matrix aka projecting back into the token embedding dimension) \n\nNow, with this design choice, we are given our second clever computational save. The original design behind multi-headed attention is for the outputs of each head to be jointed added to the residual stream. This creates a lot of additional matrix multiplications then matrix additions per head. The original designers of attention actually realized that the concatenation operation was *mathematically equivalent* to the summation operation with clever concatenation of the matrices. This allowed several matrix multiplications and additions to be condensed into a single matrix multiplication. Try this at home, if you stack n x n matrices A, B, C, D horizontally such that you get a matrix P of the dimensions n x 4n, and then take n x n matrices E\\^T, F\\^T, G\\^T, H\\^T and stack them horizontally in some matrix Q of the dimensions 4n x n. You will find that PQ is the equivalent of AE\\^T + BF\\^T + CG\\^T + DH\\^T. As a result, what they essentially did was concatenate the outputs of attention and multiplied it by some massive W\\_o matrix that was the vertical concatenation of the individual W\\_o matrices that we talked about before. Thus, saving a lot on computation.   \n  \nEDIT: after rereading a blog, actually there are some helpful things that happen with concatenation that aren’t just computational. It allows the larger W\\_o matrix to learn ways to mix information across different heads, which allows the attention to actually separate different heads for different tasks better than if it was just all added together. It preserves the subspaces that summing would forget and it allows for greater degrees of freedom with the larger W\\_o.  ",

          "text": "With regard to the FFN question, this was answered really well by some other’s in this thread with regards to the evolution of it past GRUs/LSTMs but there is also one detail that I think could be added. Transformers, like most deep learning architectures are meant to be universal function approximators (you’ll likely hear this a lot in machine learning discourse). But this is the exact reason why transformers work for literally anything, not just text. The theory of deep learning systems being universal approximators is that any standard FFN with infinite width, infinite data, and sufficient non-linearity can learn ANY function. The necessary part of universal function approximators are non-linearity. This is why there are functions like ReLU/GeLU in standard feed forward networks, it allows the network to learn non-linear behavior. There are a lot of ways to do this but ReLU/GeLU was learned as the simplest but “good enough” way to inject nonlinearity into deep learning (really easy computationally as it’s just putting negative values to zero + GeLU is smoother). Without this non-linearity, no matter how deep your network goes, you are only really able to fit linear functions (lines, planes, hyperplanes) through your data.\n\nNow, going back to transformers, if you look at attention as an operation, where is the non-linearity? Technically, the only non-linear operation in attention is the softmax function between the QK matrix and the VO matrix and the quadratic behavior of xW\\_q(xW\\_k)\\^T. As a result, attention itself as an architecture while still being a universal function approximator, has trouble going beyond. It’s really difficult for the network to learn new things because attention functionally just passes information between tokens. The FFN network is actually there to make the entire transformer *better* because it adds information and deeper non-linearity instead of primarily passing information between tokens, making it therefore better at whatever task it needs to imitate a function to succeed at.\n\nThe very common question of why we don’t just use FFNs for everything if they can approximate any function. Well, the assumption is infinite data and infinite width, which we don’t have. Architectural choices are made to make the model more easily propagate information and learn based on the limited amount of data and width (but mostly data)we have. So, another way we can think about it is that the FFNs don’t modify attention. You can think of attention as an add-on to the FFNs to help them better approximate the function of natural language given our non-finite data situation. ",

For ML/GenAI roles I’d make sure your CV leads with: the exact job titles you’re targeting, 2–3 concrete ML projects (problem, data size, models, metrics), and only the tech stack you actually used in production‑like settings. I’d also split your search: a smaller number of highly tailored applications (JD keywords reflected in your bullets) plus networking on LinkedIn/Hackathons/Kaggle/Discord so you’re not relying only on Naukri filters. If you want, you can DM me your CV and 2–3 job links and I can suggest very specific line‑by‑line changes to improve your hit rate.",

I can understand how it works with a good explanation, but not if a paper just slaps you with an equation and says \"that right there is attention\".\n\nIf you do struggle with the math, I recommend checking out channels like StatQuest on YouTube.\n\n They explain things step by step. Though sometimes they make things too simple by, for example, not using linear algebra where it would obviously make things easier.\n\nBest of luck to you.",
