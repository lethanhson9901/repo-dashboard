Polars: If your data is 10GB-100GB. It’s faster, handles memory better, and you don't need a cluster.\n3. Apache Spark: If you have Terabytes of data or need distributed computing across multiple machines.\n\nDon't optimize prematurely. You aren't \"less of an ML Engineer\" because you used Pandas for a 500MB dataset. You're just being efficient.\n\nIf you’re wondering when Spark actually makes sense in production, this guide breaks down real-world use cases, performance trade-offs, and where Spark genuinely adds value: [**Apache Spark**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/apache-spark) \n\nDoes anyone else feel like \"Big Data\" tools are over-pushed to beginners?",

If you want to go back even earlier, they were doing Dynamic Time Warping -- big emphasis on feature engineering. RNNs (LSTMs) were the gold standard until the mid-2010s, when big tech companies decided they wanted home assistants (Alexa, Siri, ...) to be a thing. Interestingly, Rabiner (HMM guy), Bengio (RNN guy), and LeCun (CNN guy) were all at Bell Labs around the same time (mostly late 80s/early 90s), with the latter two in a different department than Rabiner. All three have reasonably distinct schools of thought on the problem, but my understanding was that, post-\"The Best RNN is a CNN\", most have moved over to CNNs. Google has a bunch of good papers on this stuff, relating to keyword spotting (Sainath et al., 2015 is a good one to look at if you're interested). \n\nAs it turns out, spatial invariance with respect to spectrograms makes CNNs superior for detecting fixed patterns (think: LeCun). RNNs have many downsides; I'm sure you're aware of them. As others have said, with so little data, the model would almost certainly overfit. There's definitely some nuance (you can train an RNN on very small data sequences if you're very careful... robustness might be questionable). You can also do a lot of interesting feature extraction and data augmentation to enable small RNNs and the likes. So I would strongly argue it is possible with hard limitations. But if you can do that, just use a CNN. Maybe the interviewer wanted latency discussions? In the context of embedded devices, CNNs are still generally lighter than RNNs, unless the use case is something along the lines of streaming.",

I honestly have no clue lol, depends on a lot of factors such as which model you train, how many samples from each speaker, the actual use case and distribution of users, required levels of accuracy/performance, etc.\n\nSame idea with CNN vs RNN. It is hard to say which will definitely perform better or be better for the use case without a lot more context.\n\nHowever, to be fair, I generally lean towards CNN. On a problem like this, I would guess that CNN will probably perform better and likely requires less training data than RNN.\n\nBut it's not a hill I am going to die on. If I have a coworker that is adamant about RNN, I'm willing to experiment with both and we can see which actually performs better.\n\nHowever, the fact that the interviewer was so adamant that \"CNN is wrong, RNN is right\" is a big red flag anyways, so you probably did dodge a bullet.",

You outlined a few of these things like data acquisition, data cleaning, and data integrity. There are many more such things. Some of these things are areas of study in and of themselves.\n\nBeing quite specific, Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence which is a subfield of Computer Science, primarily. Its principal concern is with the development of statistical algorithms that can learn from known data and, ideally, generalize in some way onto unknown data. This is why good data and well-defined problems are so important.\n\nWith this in min, you need to be specific with yourself about what you are trying to learn because “learning ML” is a statement so broad that it’s useless.

Also, you should have a proper understanding of formal structures, e.g., what exactly it means when A is a subset of B.

Why complicate things with an agentic system when a straightforward script can handle it just fine? Or consider pure prediction problems—traditional ML models often outperform these complex systems. \n\nIt feels like there’s a lot of hype around agentic AI, but people seem to forget that simpler solutions often work better for many tasks. I’d love to hear from others: what are some specific tasks where you’ve found traditional methods outperform agentic AI? Are there any examples where agentic AI was overkill?",

It effectively established that publicly traded companies *must* act in the interest of their shareholders. These companies must produce quarterly earnings reports for their shareholders, which is why publicly traded companies seem so short-sighted - investors want the stock price to go up next quarter. This basically means that *publicly traded companies have an obligation to drum up investor confidence*.\n\nCompanies that produce LLMs (ChatGPT, Anthropic, etc.) turned \"AI\" into *the* hot marketing buzzword of the past several years. Also consider that company leadership is usually dominated by MBAs over technical people. Most CEOs aren't ML practitioners, and don't understand the true capabilities or limitations of LLMs, but they do know that it has been the marketing buzzword of the past several years. \n\nSo now, companies are trying to publicly \"embrace AI\" or be \"AI first\" in an effort to drum up investor confidence. We're starting to see the peak of this as consumers are beginning to resent AI implementations being shoehorned in to replace both user-friendly design and employees alike.\n\n**TLDR:** Leadership of publicly traded companies must act solely to the benefit of their investors, generally by creating excitement for potential investors and increasing the stock price, even if it means developing worse products.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI don't have the compute to train on 100B tokens or write a formal paper right now, so I'm dropping this here for the community to play with.\n\n**The Idea: \"WorkerTransformer\"**\n\nStandard Transformers are inefficient because every single token performs expensive Attention ($O(T^(2)$)) and FFN ($O(T)$) updates. But does every token really need to \"think\" deeply?\n\nI built a sparse-update architecture based on a simple intuition:\n\n1. **Divide & Conquer**: Split tokens into **Workers** (every 4th token) and **Memory** (the rest).\n2. **Workers**: Do the heavy lifting (Full Attention + FFN).\n3. **Memory**: Only do a cheap depthwise conv1d to capture local context (like Mamba/ConvNets) but **skip** the heavy Transformer block.\n4. **In-place Update**: Everything happens in-place. No extra tokens added, no sequence inflation.\n\n**The Result (on T=1024 sequence length):**\n\nI ran a \"battle\" between a Standard Transformer and my WorkerTransformer (same params, layers, dim) on a fixed 5-minute training budget.\n\n* **Standard Transformer**: 3.2 steps/s | Reached Val Loss **1.44**\n* **WorkerTransformer**: 8.0 steps/s (**2.5x speedup**) | Reached Val Loss **1.30**\n\nThe \"lazy\" model didn't just run faster; because it ran 2.5x more steps in the same timeframe, it actually learned **more** and achieved a significantly lower loss. It seems the trade-off of \"sparse compute vs. more iterations\" heavily favors sparse compute here.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:**\n\nI suspect this could scale. The architecture is **pure PyTorch** (no custom CUDA kernels needed), making it dead simple to modify.\n\nIf you have spare A100s or are looking for a weekend project, I'd love to see someone scale this up to WikiText-103 or RedPajama.\n\n**Code & Benchmarks:** [https://github.com/SuiltaPico/WorkerTransformer](https://github.com/SuiltaPico/WorkerTransformer)\n\nLet me know if you find any flaws in my reasoning or if you manage to break it!",

Including final drive paths etc. And stripping out the Homeostatic Control class may be a bit more involved than I initially let on, as this particular training script is part of a larger experimentation arc (see also the readme.md). However, it does contain the prerequisite parts for a modern Llama-style architecture, though for my own purposes I do not quantize the Janus models (I'm working on geometric regularization and interpretability, so SAE activation harvesting requires non-quantized models).\n\nIf you're curious about the purpose of the repo in question, the paper can be found here:\n\n[Janus Research || Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/18416553?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjE1YjI3YzJlLWM2YTMtNDQ0OC05NzFkLTZhNGI2NDVjZTZhMyIsImRhdGEiOnt9LCJyYW5kb20iOiI1YjI1YjAxNmNmMGJiMDU2NDUwOGJiYjE4NDJmYzk1OSJ9.fKMjndkAalSaNS4e7T1F88Qg589SzUn4X0YxHHlkusL9rSY9Rf790rqr2dgLjrB1EDYxAosyxYasg0cCQ_hk1A)\n\n[Adaptive Train.py](https://github.com/jonathanrbelanger-lang/Janus_Arc/blob/main/adaptivetrain.py)",

Don't go deep into theoretical calculus. Master Linear Algebra (Matrix multiplication/transpositions) and Probability (Bayes’ Theorem). You need to understand why a model drifts, not just that it does. \n\n\nMonth 2: Infrastructure Over Frameworks. Everyone knows PyTorch/TensorFlow. Stand out by learning MLOps and System Architecture. Can you deploy a model? Can you build a \"Circuit Breaker\" to stop a model from hallucinating? This is what real companies care about.\n\n\nMonth 3: The \"Anti-Tutorial\" Project. Build one complex, end-to-end system. Example: A RAG pipeline with a custom evaluation loop that measures its own \"Maybe Tax\" (error rate/cost). Document the failures you fixed—that’s what wins interviews.\n\n\nIf you want a specific framework for this, check out \"The Operator's Manual\" for agentic workflows. It’ll move you from a \"learner\" to an \"operator\" faster than any Udemy course. \n\n\nGood luck!",

To move from beginner to hireable, you need to transition from Model Building to System Architecting.\n\n\nHere is your \"Project-Based\" roadmap to get unstuck:\n\n1. The \"Data-Centric\" Pivot\nStop using clean Kaggle datasets. Real-world ML is 80% data engineering. Pick a \"messy\" domain (like real-time weather or stock sentiment) and build a pipeline that handles:\n \n* Feature Engineering: Automating the transformation of raw data.\n\n\n * Validation: Writing tests to ensure your data hasn't \"drifted\" (changed) since you last trained.\n\n\n2. Move from Algorithms to \"Agentic Workflows\"\nSince you’ve built NNs and XGBoost, try building a system where they talk to each other. \n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n * The Project: Build a \"Price Prediction Agent.\"\n\n\n * The Logic: Use your XGBoost model to predict a price, then use a Small Language Model (SLM) to \"justify\" that price based on news headlines. This teaches you how to bridge deterministic logic with probabilistic AI.\n\n\n3. Master the \"Logic Floor\"\nIn production, we don't just care if a model is 92% accurate; we care about what happens during the 8% it's wrong. Your next project should include a Deterministic Guardrail. If the model output looks like an outlier, your code should automatically catch it and trigger a \"Clinical Reset.\"\n\n\n4.

          "text": "You're not lost, you're just at the transition point. Going from \"I implemented algorithms\" to \"I can solve problems\" is the next step, and it's where most people stall.\n\nThe good news: implementing from scratch means you understand what's happening. That puts you ahead of people who just call sklearn and hope for the best.\n\nWhat to do next:\n\nStop implementing algorithms. Start solving problems.\n\nYou've proven you understand the mechanics. Now prove you can apply them to real situations. That's what jobs and projects require.\n\nHow to do project-based learning right:\n\n1. Start with a question, not a technique. Not \"I want to use XGBoost\" but \"Can I predict which customers will churn?\" The technique serves the problem, not the other way around.\n\n2. Use real or realistic data. Kaggle has plenty. Pick something that interests you — healthcare, sports, finance, e-commerce, whatever. Interest keeps you going when it gets frustrating.\n\n3. Go end-to-end. Data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and a summary of what you found. That full loop is what employers want to see.\n\n4. Document everything. A project without a README is invisible. Explain the problem, your approach, your results, and what you learned.\n\n5. Keep scope small at first. One dataset, one question, one model. You can always expand later.\n\nProject ideas based on what you already know:\n\n\\- Churn prediction (classification — trees, XGB)\n\n\\- House price prediction (regression — linear, random forest)\n\n\\- Customer segmentation (clustering — add KMeans to your toolkit)\n\n\\- Loan default prediction (classification + imbalanced data)\n\n\\- Demand forecasting (time series — stretch goal)\n\nPick one that sounds interesting and finish it completely. A finished simple project teaches more than five half-built complex ones.\n\nOn your learning being \"all over the place\":\n\nThat's normal. Most people bounce around early on. The fix is committing to one project and seeing it through. You'll fill in gaps as you go.\n\n\n\nI put together 15 portfolio projects with end-to-end structure — churn, forecasting, segmentation, fraud detection, and more. Each has code, documentation, and a case study. Might help you see how to frame and complete projects.\n\n$5.99 if useful: [https://whop.com/codeascend/the-portfolio-shortcut/](https://whop.com/codeascend/the-portfolio-shortcut/)\n\n\n\nEither way, pick one project and finish it this week. That momentum will tell you what to learn next better than any roadmap.",
