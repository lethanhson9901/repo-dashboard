The replacement won’t even look like a Transformer at all. It’ll be more like a system with operators, phases, and persistent internal dynamics. A reasoning engine built on top of representation.",

It stresses people out.\n\nAfter working in the field, here is the realistic hierarchy I actually use:\n\n1. Pandas: If your data fits in RAM (<10GB). Stick to this. It's the standard.\n2. Polars: If your data is 10GB-100GB. It’s faster, handles memory better, and you don't need a cluster.\n3. Apache Spark: If you have Terabytes of data or need distributed computing across multiple machines.\n\nDon't optimize prematurely. You aren't \"less of an ML Engineer\" because you used Pandas for a 500MB dataset. You're just being efficient.\n\nIf you’re wondering when Spark actually makes sense in production, this guide breaks down real-world use cases, performance trade-offs, and where Spark genuinely adds value: [**Apache Spark**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/apache-spark) \n\nDoes anyone else feel like \"Big Data\" tools are over-pushed to beginners?",

I think everyone is laying out good cases for why the person asking you that might be crazy, what they may have meant. \n\nTo take another angle as devil's advocate, when they \"asked for a model that is not trained with internet data\", perhaps they meant for you to take into account pre-trained models, though it doesn't sound that way with \"no data from internet\". Maybe that's not how they see it. It might be the case that they had in mind a pre-trained model that can calibrate in 20 samples. But more likely, it seems like they might just be under the impression that more classic \"last gen\" voice recognition is recurrent in some way, when its more likely a weird knowledge graph. Maybe they're thinking of a CNN on a raw wave form, vs an RNN on a spectrograph. Idk.",

          "text": "It sounds like they're pretty old school -- a lot of the field came from mixture modelling and HMMs that emerged in the 80s (think: Rabiner & others) -- later, n-grams & RNNs. If you want to go back even earlier, they were doing Dynamic Time Warping -- big emphasis on feature engineering. RNNs (LSTMs) were the gold standard until the mid-2010s, when big tech companies decided they wanted home assistants (Alexa, Siri, ...) to be a thing. Interestingly, Rabiner (HMM guy), Bengio (RNN guy), and LeCun (CNN guy) were all at Bell Labs around the same time (mostly late 80s/early 90s), with the latter two in a different department than Rabiner. All three have reasonably distinct schools of thought on the problem, but my understanding was that, post-\"The Best RNN is a CNN\", most have moved over to CNNs. Google has a bunch of good papers on this stuff, relating to keyword spotting (Sainath et al., 2015 is a good one to look at if you're interested). \n\nAs it turns out, spatial invariance with respect to spectrograms makes CNNs superior for detecting fixed patterns (think: LeCun). RNNs have many downsides; I'm sure you're aware of them. As others have said, with so little data, the model would almost certainly overfit. There's definitely some nuance (you can train an RNN on very small data sequences if you're very careful... robustness might be questionable). You can also do a lot of interesting feature extraction and data augmentation to enable small RNNs and the likes. So I would strongly argue it is possible with hard limitations. But if you can do that, just use a CNN. Maybe the interviewer wanted latency discussions? In the context of embedded devices, CNNs are still generally lighter than RNNs, unless the use case is something along the lines of streaming.",

Wanted to share a lesson I learned the hard way about embedding-based matching  might save someone else the same mistake.\n\n**The approach**: Embed user profiles via LLM into 1536-dim vectors, store in Pinecone, query with ANN + metadata filters. Sub-200ms, scales well, semantically smart — \"loves hiking\" matches \"outdoor enthusiast\" automatically.\n\n**What went wrong**: 22% mutual acceptance rate. I audited the rejected high-scoring matches and found this:\n\n    User A: \"Career-focused lawyer, wants kids in 2 years, monogamy essential\"\n    User B: \"Career-focused consultant, never wants kids, open relationship\"\n    \n    Cosine similarity: 0.91\n    Reality: incompatible on two dealbreakers\n    \n\nEmbeddings captured *how someone describes their life*, tone, topic, semantic texture. They completely missed *what someone actually needs*, the structured preferences buried in the prose.\n\nThis wasn't an edge case. It was the dominant failure mode. High similarity, fundamental incompatibility. Two people who sounded alike but wanted completely different things.\n\n**The lesson**: Embedding similarity is necessary but not sufficient for compatibility. If your domain has dealbreakers, hard constraints where incompatibility on a single dimension overrides overall similarity, you need structured signal extraction on top.\n\n**What I did instead** (brief summary):\n\n1. Extracted 26 structured features from natural AI conversations (not surveys, 30% survey completion vs 85% conversational extraction)\n2. Built distance matrices: nuanced compatibility scores (0.0-1.0) instead of binary match/no-match\n3. Added hard filters: 4 dealbreaker features that reject pairs before scoring, zero exceptions\n4. Combined signals: `0.25 × text + 0.15 × visual + 0.60 × features`\n\n22% to 35% with this. Two more stages (personalized weights + bidirectional matching) took it to 68%.\n\nThis generalizes beyond dating; job matching (remote vs on-site is a dealbreaker regardless of skill similarity), marketplace matching (budget overrides preference), probably others.\n\nHas anyone else hit this wall with embeddings? Curious how others handle the structured-vs-semantic tradeoff.\n\nEdit:\nI know how training a biencoder on pairwise data would help, but mining hard negatives in such cases becomes a key challenge and also loses bidirectional non equivalence of liking one another ",

Learn the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning and get comfortable with the idea of features, labels, training, and testing. At the same time, refresh Python basics you’ll use all the time in ML, especially NumPy and pandas. Try loading a dataset, cleaning it, and doing some simple exploration.\n\nIn week two, start with your first real models. Learn linear regression and logistic regression and implement them using scikit-learn. Don’t worry about the math being perfect, just understand what the model is trying to do and how to evaluate it. Work with a small dataset and focus on things like train/test split, accuracy, and mean squared error.\n\nWeek three, classic machine learning algorithms. Learn decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests. This is where ideas like overfitting and bias vs variance start to make sense. Try changing model parameters and see how performance changes. This experimentation is more important than memorizing formulas.\n\nIn the fourth week, put everything together in a small project. Take a dataset from Kaggle and go end to end: clean the data, choose a model, train it, evaluate it, and explain your results in plain language. Even a simple project here will boost your confidence a lot.\n\nBy the end of the month, you won’t be an expert, but you’ll actually understand how machine learning works and how to build models. From there, you can decide whether to go deeper into math, try deep learning, or focus on more projects.",

I end up jumping between resources to fill gaps and lose a clear sense of progression.\n\n**Background:** Bachelor’s degree; some linear algebra & calculus (needs review); basic/intermediate Python.\n\n**Goal:**\n\nAt minimum, stay on a correct learning path and accumulate skills steadily.\n\nLong-term, build a strong foundation and the ability to implement/diagnose models independently.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. When does it make sense to read papers, and how do you avoid getting lost in prerequisites?\n2. What “must-have” fundamentals should come before reading modern deep learning papers?\n3. Top-down (papers → fill gaps) vs bottom-up (fundamentals → models → papers): which works better, and what milestone sequence would you recommend?\n4. What practice routine forces real understanding (e.g., implementations, reproductions, projects)?\n\nNot looking for a huge link dump—just a practical roadmap and milestones.\n\nThanks!",

          "text": "Bottom-up always or you will be lost in the sauce. Here is what I’d suggest.\n\nYou need to start in the metaphorical basement: linear algebra (at least understanding the topics covered by a typical college course, and maybe some extras - critical concepts include vector spaces and their properties, matrix manipulation / multiplication and matrix properties, linear transformations and their properties), calculus (limits, differentiation, integration, multi-variable calculus should be sufficient for basics), and maybe most importantly probability + statistics (understanding probability spaces, I.e., how do we define them, random variables, random vectors, functions of random variables, stochastic processes, etc.) I would also strongly recommend studying statistical estimation and detection - the theory underpins fundamental problems tackled by ML. Also, understanding some optimization theory would be useful (e.g., convex optimization, KKT, etc.).\n\nThen you can move onto an ML intro course’s content: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, basic optimization if not already learned (GD and SGD), multi-layer perceptrons (simple NNs), etc. There are of course more “intro” concepts, but I think these would give you a strong foundation.\n\nFrom here, you should dive into more advanced topics that interest you. I would advise avoiding papers until you have a very high mathematical maturity level and truly understand fundamental concepts. Most papers (or their key concepts) can be found described in blog posts that are easier to digest.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I would strongly suggest pursuing an MS or a PhD if you are serious about getting into ML. Self-learning ML is much more difficult than just learning to code. Coding is a part of the job of course, but it is the easiest part (at least for researchers).",

The important thing is building an understanding behind regularization, data snooping, and other fundamental concepts\n\n3.

Once you have discovered a problem you can ask whatever LLM you prefer a structured a roadmap of what you should know to tackle the problem using ML from basics. From there you learn + build simultaneously whether its by reading up on an algorithm or seeing how others have implemented it in code etc. \n\nFor example, if you have to use linear regression at some point just knowing what is it about the fundamental nature of linear regression that helps solve this problem can help you master certain commonly used ML algorithms\n\nAlthough i would say before u build something serious u should have a good grasp on the mathematics especially linear algebra. im currently studying it from this book https://mml-book.github.io which has been recommended a lot in this subreddit.

But does every token really need to \"think\" deeply?\n\nI built a sparse-update architecture based on a simple intuition:\n\n1. **Divide & Conquer**: Split tokens into **Workers** (every 4th token) and **Memory** (the rest).\n2. **Workers**: Do the heavy lifting (Full Attention + FFN).\n3. **Memory**: Only do a cheap depthwise conv1d to capture local context (like Mamba/ConvNets) but **skip** the heavy Transformer block.\n4. **In-place Update**: Everything happens in-place. No extra tokens added, no sequence inflation.\n\n**The Result (on T=1024 sequence length):**\n\nI ran a \"battle\" between a Standard Transformer and my WorkerTransformer (same params, layers, dim) on a fixed 5-minute training budget.\n\n* **Standard Transformer**: 3.2 steps/s | Reached Val Loss **1.44**\n* **WorkerTransformer**: 8.0 steps/s (**2.5x speedup**) | Reached Val Loss **1.30**\n\nThe \"lazy\" model didn't just run faster; because it ran 2.5x more steps in the same timeframe, it actually learned **more** and achieved a significantly lower loss. It seems the trade-off of \"sparse compute vs. more iterations\" heavily favors sparse compute here.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:**\n\nI suspect this could scale. The architecture is **pure PyTorch** (no custom CUDA kernels needed), making it dead simple to modify.\n\nIf you have spare A100s or are looking for a weekend project, I'd love to see someone scale this up to WikiText-103 or RedPajama.\n\n**Code & Benchmarks:** [https://github.com/SuiltaPico/WorkerTransformer](https://github.com/SuiltaPico/WorkerTransformer)\n\nLet me know if you find any flaws in my reasoning or if you manage to break it!",
