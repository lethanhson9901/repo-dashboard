The cleaning, chunking, and optimization challenges are exactly what excites me.\n\nWhat I built:\n\n\\- Full RAG pipeline with optimized data processing\n\n\\- Processed 2M+ pages (cleaning, chunking, vectorization)\n\n\\- Semantic search & Q&A over massive dataset\n\n\\- Constantly tweaking for better retrieval & performance\n\n\\- Python, MIT Licensed, open source\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nIt’s trending, real-world data at scale, the perfect playground.\n\nWhen you operate at scale, every optimization matters. This project lets me experiment with RAG architectures, data pipelines, and AI performance tuning on real-world workloads.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG](https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG)\n\nOpen to ideas, optimizations, and technical discussions!",

Did you construct a labeled query set, or are you relying mostly on qualitative inspection?\n\nWith RAG in particular, chunking strategy and embedding choice often dominate performance more than downstream model tweaks. It would be helpful to see ablations on chunk size, overlap, and indexing strategy. At that scale, even small retrieval improvements can meaningfully change end to end behavior.\n\nAlso, how are you handling deduplication and noisy documents? Large news style corpora can inflate index size without adding much signal. that trade off becomes pretty important once you move beyond toy datasets.",

Running a high end gpu at full speed uses 400g of carbon per hour.\n\nAs for LLMS gpt 3 (when this guys says ai he probably means llms) had a 500 metric tones of co2 as a consequence of training. Meaning we need around 5 billion queries (without considering the extra carbon related to infering or Sending the data around, which would likely around double the number of queries) to match that.\n\nGpt3 is one of many many models and every new model has a bigger cost in energy and carbon to train and run. Gpt5 is estimated to be hundreds to thousands or times costlier to train and inference is estimated to be 20 times more expensive, meaning a conservative guess would be breaking even to streaming at around 500 BILLION queries, but probably closer to a couple trillion without considering inference.\n\nIs every model released by deepseek, gemini, gpt, llama, grok, answering enough questions in their \"year of relevance\" until a new one comes out to break even? And are the query counts increasing enough to justify the growth into more and more expensive models?",

What strikes me most is how we've normalized high-bandwidth streaming as a baseline expectation while simultaneously criticizing AI's energy use. I'm genuinely curious: has anyone here experimented with local upscaling solutions? It seems like training models that can enhance 480p to higher resolutions on-device could be a practical middle ground. Would love to hear from folks working on efficient inference - what's the current state of real-time video upscaling on consumer hardware?",

You outlined a few of these things like data acquisition, data cleaning, and data integrity. There are many more such things. Some of these things are areas of study in and of themselves.\n\nBeing quite specific, Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence which is a subfield of Computer Science, primarily. Its principal concern is with the development of statistical algorithms that can learn from known data and, ideally, generalize in some way onto unknown data. This is why good data and well-defined problems are so important.\n\nWith this in min, you need to be specific with yourself about what you are trying to learn because “learning ML” is a statement so broad that it’s useless. Focus on a specific algorithm or idea. Even after you’ve “learned it,” there is still the question of implementation. How low-level (or not) do you want to go? What is your goal?\n\nThis is not a thing to be “grokked.”",

But this is intuition you get from modeling clean datasets. It’s a skill you get over time, you’ll get better at knowing what your data should look like.\n\n\\- The confusion is fair. ML is an ocean of a field. Many topics and models, and a lot of depth for each topic. Start with linear regression. Then go to decision trees, KNN, bagging. Don’t go straight into neural nets. Walk before you run.\n\n\\- ML did not click for me until grad school tbh. It really started when I built a model from scratch (which is difficult but invaluable). And also formal comparison of different models with the same task.\n\n\\- My understanding of ML is not uniform. I’m solid with supervised, decent with NLP/neural nets and transformers. But stuff like reinforcement and clustering I really only get the gist of. \n\n\\- Role/title: in the short term, look at the actual descriptions, much of these overlap.

What helps is working with small units (2x2 matrices, simple vectors), doing operations by hand once, asking what they do to data, and why they matter, then implementing them in a few lines of   Numpy(or pure python) and using intuition-building resources like 3blue1brown.\n\n\nCopying notebooks is fine at first, but real learning starts when you break things, tweak parameters, and try to rebuild models on your own and get stuck - that stuck feeling is a signal, not failure. Real data is messy because real ml is messy, which is why beginner projects like Titanic or House prices still matter: they teach you the actual lifecycle (data -> preprocessing -> feature engineering -> training -> evaluation -> tuning as a loop) and how small changes affect outcomes. \n\n\nMost people start in Jupyter, and that's okay, but after a few projects you should move toward modular code, functions and folders - that's where ML starts to feel real.\n\n\nNot knowing whether you want to be an ML engineer, data scientist, researcher or GenAI engineer is normal too, clarity comes after building and breaking things, not before.

I keep running into situations where traditional ML or even simple scripts would have been way more efficient. \n\nTake repetitive tasks, for instance. Why complicate things with an agentic system when a straightforward script can handle it just fine? Or consider pure prediction problems—traditional ML models often outperform these complex systems. \n\nIt feels like there’s a lot of hype around agentic AI, but people seem to forget that simpler solutions often work better for many tasks. I’d love to hear from others: what are some specific tasks where you’ve found traditional methods outperform agentic AI? Are there any examples where agentic AI was overkill?",

The SWE/IT based AI team didn't partition the data, tons of leakage, poor extrapolation, and the 95% CI's have effective coverage rates of the true parameter of around 25%.\n\nWas it worth trying, yes, was it worth trying the way they approached the problem, absolutely not.

          "text": "A 1919 US Supreme Court case, *Dodge v. Ford*, is the reason modern capitalism is the way it is. It effectively established that publicly traded companies *must* act in the interest of their shareholders. These companies must produce quarterly earnings reports for their shareholders, which is why publicly traded companies seem so short-sighted - investors want the stock price to go up next quarter. This basically means that *publicly traded companies have an obligation to drum up investor confidence*.\n\nCompanies that produce LLMs (ChatGPT, Anthropic, etc.) turned \"AI\" into *the* hot marketing buzzword of the past several years. Also consider that company leadership is usually dominated by MBAs over technical people. Most CEOs aren't ML practitioners, and don't understand the true capabilities or limitations of LLMs, but they do know that it has been the marketing buzzword of the past several years. \n\nSo now, companies are trying to publicly \"embrace AI\" or be \"AI first\" in an effort to drum up investor confidence. We're starting to see the peak of this as consumers are beginning to resent AI implementations being shoehorned in to replace both user-friendly design and employees alike.\n\n**TLDR:** Leadership of publicly traded companies must act solely to the benefit of their investors, generally by creating excitement for potential investors and increasing the stock price, even if it means developing worse products.",

The concept in itself should be straigh forward, the inductive bias is: **Expect a linear relationship between the features** (the input) **and the predicted value** (the output) and this should result geometrically in a straight line if the training data has only 1 feature, a flat plane if it has 2 features and so on.\n\nI don't understand how could a straight line overly adapt to the data if it's straight. I see how it could underfit but not overfit.\n\nThis can happen of course with polynomial regression which results in curved lines and planes, in that case the solution to overfit should be reducing the features or using regularization which weights the parameters of the function resulting in a curve that fits better the data.\n\nIn theory this makes sense but I keep seeing examples online where linear regression is used to illustrate overfitting.\n\nIs polynomial regression a type of linear regression? I tried to make sense of this but the examples keep showing these 2 as separated concepts. ",

A \"y=mx+c\" line is fit to a sample of the data and fails to generalise. Failure to generalise is the whole point of the concept of \"fitness\", but the problem is that the sample used to train the model does not represent the whole data eg higher gradient\n\n2. Too complex. If the true relationship is of the form \"y=mx\", but the model learns on offset, so \"y=mx+c\". This can be different from 1 if your data has a couple of inconvenient outliers. This is a classic case of an over parametrised model\n\n3. The model is not order 1 linear, but the data is order 1 linear. Basically people use language how they like and sometimes even respectably knowledgeable people use linear to mean \"a line of best fit\" so categorically include functions with more degrees of freedom (eg splines and polynomials)",

Including final drive paths etc. And stripping out the Homeostatic Control class may be a bit more involved than I initially let on, as this particular training script is part of a larger experimentation arc (see also the readme.md).

Don't go deep into theoretical calculus. Master Linear Algebra (Matrix multiplication/transpositions) and Probability (Bayes’ Theorem). You need to understand why a model drifts, not just that it does. \n\n\nMonth 2: Infrastructure Over Frameworks. Everyone knows PyTorch/TensorFlow. Stand out by learning MLOps and System Architecture. Can you deploy a model? Can you build a \"Circuit Breaker\" to stop a model from hallucinating? This is what real companies care about.\n\n\nMonth 3: The \"Anti-Tutorial\" Project. Build one complex, end-to-end system. Example: A RAG pipeline with a custom evaluation loop that measures its own \"Maybe Tax\" (error rate/cost). Document the failures you fixed—that’s what wins interviews.\n\n\nIf you want a specific framework for this, check out \"The Operator's Manual\" for agentic workflows.

          "text": "Building algorithms from scratch is the \"Trial by Fire\" phase, and the fact that you’ve done it means you have a stronger foundation than 90% of beginners. \nBut you’ve reached the \"Implementation Trap\"—where you know how the engine works, but you haven't learned how to drive the car in traffic.\n\n\nIn 2026, the gap between \"code that works in a notebook\" and \"code that works in production\" is massive. To move from beginner to hireable, you need to transition from Model Building to System Architecting.\n\n\nHere is your \"Project-Based\" roadmap to get unstuck:\n\n1. The \"Data-Centric\" Pivot\nStop using clean Kaggle datasets. Real-world ML is 80% data engineering. Pick a \"messy\" domain (like real-time weather or stock sentiment) and build a pipeline that handles:\n \n* Feature Engineering: Automating the transformation of raw data.\n\n\n * Validation: Writing tests to ensure your data hasn't \"drifted\" (changed) since you last trained.\n\n\n2. Move from Algorithms to \"Agentic Workflows\"\nSince you’ve built NNs and XGBoost, try building a system where they talk to each other. \n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n * The Project: Build a \"Price Prediction Agent.\"\n\n\n * The Logic: Use your XGBoost model to predict a price, then use a Small Language Model (SLM) to \"justify\" that price based on news headlines. This teaches you how to bridge deterministic logic with probabilistic AI.\n\n\n3. Master the \"Logic Floor\"\nIn production, we don't just care if a model is 92% accurate; we care about what happens during the 8% it's wrong. Your next project should include a Deterministic Guardrail. If the model output looks like an outlier, your code should automatically catch it and trigger a \"Clinical Reset.\"\n\n\n4. Deployment is the New \"From Scratch\"\nIf it isn't on a server, it doesn't exist. \n\n\nTake your best scratch-built model and:\n\n\n * Wrap it in a FastAPI.\n\n\n * Containerize it with Docker.\n\n\n * Deploy it to a cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Vercel).\n\n\nI’ve mapped out the specific Mechanical Logic blueprints I use to turn \"scratch\" algorithms into production-grade systems in my bio. It’s the \"Senior\" layer you’re missing—moving from understanding the math to managing the Zero-Drift lifecycle of a model.",

          "text": "You're not lost, you're just at the transition point. Going from \"I implemented algorithms\" to \"I can solve problems\" is the next step, and it's where most people stall.\n\nThe good news: implementing from scratch means you understand what's happening. That puts you ahead of people who just call sklearn and hope for the best.\n\nWhat to do next:\n\nStop implementing algorithms. Start solving problems.\n\nYou've proven you understand the mechanics. Now prove you can apply them to real situations. That's what jobs and projects require.\n\nHow to do project-based learning right:\n\n1. Start with a question, not a technique. Not \"I want to use XGBoost\" but \"Can I predict which customers will churn?\" The technique serves the problem, not the other way around.\n\n2. Use real or realistic data. Kaggle has plenty. Pick something that interests you — healthcare, sports, finance, e-commerce, whatever. Interest keeps you going when it gets frustrating.\n\n3. Go end-to-end. Data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and a summary of what you found. That full loop is what employers want to see.\n\n4. Document everything. A project without a README is invisible. Explain the problem, your approach, your results, and what you learned.\n\n5. Keep scope small at first. One dataset, one question, one model. You can always expand later.\n\nProject ideas based on what you already know:\n\n\\- Churn prediction (classification — trees, XGB)\n\n\\- House price prediction (regression — linear, random forest)\n\n\\- Customer segmentation (clustering — add KMeans to your toolkit)\n\n\\- Loan default prediction (classification + imbalanced data)\n\n\\- Demand forecasting (time series — stretch goal)\n\nPick one that sounds interesting and finish it completely. A finished simple project teaches more than five half-built complex ones.\n\nOn your learning being \"all over the place\":\n\nThat's normal. Most people bounce around early on. The fix is committing to one project and seeing it through. You'll fill in gaps as you go.\n\n\n\nI put together 15 portfolio projects with end-to-end structure — churn, forecasting, segmentation, fraud detection, and more. Each has code, documentation, and a case study. Might help you see how to frame and complete projects.\n\n$5.99 if useful: [https://whop.com/codeascend/the-portfolio-shortcut/](https://whop.com/codeascend/the-portfolio-shortcut/)\n\n\n\nEither way, pick one project and finish it this week. That momentum will tell you what to learn next better than any roadmap.",
