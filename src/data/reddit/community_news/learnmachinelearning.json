Then we learn the chain-rule matrix formulas for back propagating errors to compute the slope, and its a more intuitive transition.",

Would go after diff eqs + calc, def before any analysis classes.\n\n- DS&A should go after Linear algebra, sooner rather than later. Ideally in Python. \n\n- Stats should be way earlier. Would put after calc, diff eqs and higher math. Would also add Bayesian stats or stochastics after stats.\n\n- I’d add regression after linear algebra/ calc and before ML.\n\n- ML shouldn’t be until after the stats and regression classes if you add them\n\n- i don’t think you need a whole ML theory class. I think you’ll get enough on that between regular ML, DL, RL and all the stats leading up to it. \n\n- I took real analysis then numerical analysis after higher math. I never took complex analysis, abstract algebra or topology, but since you have RA at the bottom, Id consult a pure math person about ordering those. \n\n- I never took CV and I didnt need it for NLP. So I think you can move NLP up if you’d like.\n\n- everything below reinforcement I think is overkill, a reasonably up to date NLP class should cover what you need to know there. \n\n- I think Reinforcement could be moved up to around Deep Learning. I never took pure RL so idk how involved neural nets are, but I didn’t need more than the jist of RL for NLP. That might depend on if the ML class touches on RL or not. \n\nJust my opinions from my undergrad + grad experience",

Usually, you have spivak -> abbott -> rudin--though as a matter of taste, I would use tao rather than abbott. Complex analysis isn't really necessary for ML, but if you want the completeness, you should be putting it after real analysis, despite it being \"more well-behaved\". I would also recommend splitting up the algebra sequence, with at least something like \"A First Course in Abstract Algebra\" by John B. Fraleigh before D&F.\n\nYou will want to at least have gone through abbott + most of D&F before starting topology, as it builds the motivation (and covers the basics) for point-set topology.\n\nStats should be handled much earlier... and I recommend prefacing it with some kind probabilities work.\n\nLastly, I'm not sure how much CS background you have, but if it's not a lot, I recommend more CS groundwork before diving straight into ML. Theory of computation, data structures & algorithms, etc.",

Many things can be moved around, but you need to get a sense of what knowledge depends on what before trying to commit to a strict ordering. \n\n\n\nIf you want to be efficient with time and have a regular background, undergrad curricula aren't too far off. A common set of courses for Math + CS in the first year is: differential & integral calculus, intro linear algebra, elementary probability, intro discrete mathematics, and intro predicate logic.",

From what I’m seeing in job descriptions vs. actual offers, here is the breakdown.\n\nI’d love for the Seniors here to weigh in and correct me if this matches your experience.\n\nTier 1: The \"Jupyter Notebook\" Engineer\n\n* Role: You can train models, clean data, and use Scikit-Learn/PyTorch in a notebook environment.\n* Reality: This market is oversaturated.\n\nTier 2: The \"Production\" MLE (Where the money is)\n\n* Role: You don't just train models; you serve them. You know Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and how to optimize inference latency.\n* The Jump: The salary often jumps 40-50% here. The gap isn't about better math; it’s about Software Engineering.\n\nTier 3: The \"Specialized\" Engineer\n\n* Role: Custom CUDA kernels, distributed training systems, or novel LLM architecture.\n* Comp: Outlier salaries.\n\nThe Question for the Community: For those of you who broke past the $150k mark: What was the specific technical skill that got you the raise? Was it System Design? MLOps? Or just YOE?\n\nWhile researching benchmarks, I found this breakdown on [**machine learning engineer salary**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/machine-learning-engineer-salary) trends helpful to get a baseline, but the discussion on this sub often tells a different story.\n\nLet's get a realistic thread going.

They often overlap a lot in titles too.\n\nIf you want money then the answer is aim for top paying companies and work up career ladder. Job hopping is fine early on, it’s hard to make staff+ by job hopping and for that you tend to need to get promoted.\n\nMy current place pays seniors (5+ years experience) in ml around 500-600ish before bonus. Bonus are very variable with many getting little and some getting another 200k. Staff/senior staff/principal exist too as levels and I think staff is 800k roughly while senior staff is low million (unsure principal is, that’s quite rare).\n\nTop places are basically few ai startups, openai, finance. Those can pay close to a million for senior level. Unsure where openai sits for people that join today but a couple years ago I had a friend join as a senior for ~1.5 million comp there.",

For the first, a good book is Dejiver&Kittler, and for the second there’s vapnik or kearns&vazirani. These are suitable if ur math and stats are at a graduate level. A good combination of the material is the recent Foundation of Machine Learning. \n\nBut my own perspective on this is: just because you know the math, doesn’t mean you need to use it. You could read all of what I suggested and not know a thing about what people are working on today. If instead that’s ur goal, then u should just do what everyone else is doing: ie do online courses on machine learning and deep learning and RL from top universities (Berkeley and Stanford are good starting points to look). If ur math is advanced then you can run thru some problems quite quickly but you will probably still find a good amount of things to be non trivial. Also if ur comfortable with research level math the theoretical research for ML should not be daunting once you have done the courses, and you can go from there.",

But if what Claude tells me is true, then can we really claim that attention is all that is important? Shouldn't it be \"attention - combined with FFN, add & norm, multi-head concat, linear projection and everything else - is all you need?\"\n\nIs there more recent work that tries to justify these architectural details?

In addition, LSTMs were not very parallellizable because you had to do backprop through time, meaning you need to process previous token before you can process current one.\n\nLatest innovation in RNNs was using attention to close some of these gaps. These models started outperforming the pure LSTM/GRU models and were gaining traction. The paper is called \"Attention is all you need\" because they proposed that the memory layers were not necessary. Giving them up and having only attention and linear layers meant 1) More stable learning due to attention outperforming memory cells 2) parallellizable in both training and in inference.\n\nYou correctly pointed out that a lot of those decisions are empirical. Theory might suggest one thing, but we'll probably go with what works better. Look at the pre-norm and post-norm debate. There's also papers explaining these, but I'm not sure whether there is one that explains all. There's usually deep dive papers that try to explain these with other tools. It could be training stability, gradient flow etc.",

          "text": "The reason behind the concatenation a more computationally efficient way to do matrix addition. I'm sure you are familiar with how attention works where the output is equivalent to softmax(QK\\^T/\\\\sqrt(d\\_k))\\*V. Now originally, you would add this to the residual stream. However, researchers realized there were two things that made this naive way more computationally expensive. \n\nFirst, the QK attention scores are typically in the form nxn (where n is sequence length). This would need to be multiplied by a matrix V, which projected nxn matrix back into a matrix of nxd\\_embed to match the dimension of its input. However, this meant that the V matrix needed to be of size nxd\\_embed. Remember that the V matrix is created by multiplying the inputs x in the form n x d\\_embed by a corresponding learned weight matrix commonly dubbed W\\_v. This W\\_v matrix would, therefore, need to be d\\_embed x d\\_embed. The original authors, I believe, planned thinking that embedding dimension might be parameter set very large in the future. For instance, GPT3's embedding dimension is around 12288 long. Therefore, the W\\_v matrix in the naive way would be 12288x12288, which is massive for each head. They realized that they didn't actually need this many parameters and also storing this massive matrix 96 times(the amount of heads GPT3 would eventually have) is prohibitively expensive. The original authors likely foresaw this and factorized the W\\_v matrix into two lower rank forms. The first matrix commonly retains the name W\\_v(the matrix first multiplied to input x that projects it down to some smaller dimension, say 128). The second matrix is now typically called W\\_o (the matrix that is multiplied to the output of x\\*W\\_v that converts it from an nx128 matrix into an nxd\\_embed matrix aka projecting back into the token embedding dimension) \n\nNow, with this design choice, we are given our second clever computational save. The original design behind multi-headed attention is for the outputs of each head to be jointed added to the residual stream. This creates a lot of additional matrix multiplications then matrix additions per head. The original designers of attention actually realized that the concatenation operation was *mathematically equivalent* to the summation operation with clever concatenation of the matrices. This allowed several matrix multiplications and additions to be condensed into a single matrix multiplication. Try this at home, if you stack n x n matrices A, B, C, D horizontally such that you get a matrix P of the dimensions n x 4n, and then take n x n matrices E\\^T, F\\^T, G\\^T, H\\^T and stack them horizontally in some matrix Q of the dimensions 4n x n. You will find that PQ is the equivalent of AE\\^T + BF\\^T + CG\\^T + DH\\^T. As a result, what they essentially did was concatenate the outputs of attention and multiplied it by some massive W\\_o matrix that was the vertical concatenation of the individual W\\_o matrices that we talked about before. Thus, saving a lot on computation.   \n  \nEDIT: after rereading a blog, actually there are some helpful things that happen with concatenation that aren’t just computational. It allows the larger W\\_o matrix to learn ways to mix information across different heads, which allows the attention to actually separate different heads for different tasks better than if it was just all added together. It preserves the subspaces that summing would forget and it allows for greater degrees of freedom with the larger W\\_o.  ",

          "text": "With regard to the FFN question, this was answered really well by some other’s in this thread with regards to the evolution of it past GRUs/LSTMs but there is also one detail that I think could be added. Transformers, like most deep learning architectures are meant to be universal function approximators (you’ll likely hear this a lot in machine learning discourse). But this is the exact reason why transformers work for literally anything, not just text. The theory of deep learning systems being universal approximators is that any standard FFN with infinite width, infinite data, and sufficient non-linearity can learn ANY function. The necessary part of universal function approximators are non-linearity. This is why there are functions like ReLU/GeLU in standard feed forward networks, it allows the network to learn non-linear behavior. There are a lot of ways to do this but ReLU/GeLU was learned as the simplest but “good enough” way to inject nonlinearity into deep learning (really easy computationally as it’s just putting negative values to zero + GeLU is smoother). Without this non-linearity, no matter how deep your network goes, you are only really able to fit linear functions (lines, planes, hyperplanes) through your data.\n\nNow, going back to transformers, if you look at attention as an operation, where is the non-linearity? Technically, the only non-linear operation in attention is the softmax function between the QK matrix and the VO matrix and the quadratic behavior of xW\\_q(xW\\_k)\\^T. As a result, attention itself as an architecture while still being a universal function approximator, has trouble going beyond. It’s really difficult for the network to learn new things because attention functionally just passes information between tokens. The FFN network is actually there to make the entire transformer *better* because it adds information and deeper non-linearity instead of primarily passing information between tokens, making it therefore better at whatever task it needs to imitate a function to succeed at.\n\nThe very common question of why we don’t just use FFNs for everything if they can approximate any function. Well, the assumption is infinite data and infinite width, which we don’t have. Architectural choices are made to make the model more easily propagate information and learn based on the limited amount of data and width (but mostly data)we have. So, another way we can think about it is that the FFNs don’t modify attention. You can think of attention as an add-on to the FFNs to help them better approximate the function of natural language given our non-finite data situation. ",
