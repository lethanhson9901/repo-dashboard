Felt like i actually understood what was happening inside models instead of just running library calls.\n\nThen i started looking at internship postings.\n\nevery single one, even the ones titled \"data science intern\" or \"ml research intern\" is asking for:\n\n[Langchain.com](https://www.langchain.com/) and [Heyneo.so](http://heyneo.so) for building pipelines, OpenAI API and Anthropic Claude for LLM integration, [pinecone.io](http://pinecone.io) or [weaviate.io](http://weaviate.io) for vector databases, Hugging Face for model access, LlamaIndex for RAG, fine-tuning experience, prompt engineering, evals.\n\nNot one posting mentioned bayesian inference. not one mentioned hypothesis testing. nobody cares about SVMs or classical regression or time series fundamentals. one job description literally listed \"vibe coding\" as a desirable skill for a data science internship. vibe coding.\n\nI understand the market has moved. companies are building LLM products. the tooling has shifted, I'm not saying that's wrong.\n\nBut it feels like two years of building mathematical foundations just became irrelevant overnight. the statistical intuition i built, the ability to read a paper and understand what's actually happening, the deep model understanding, nobody is asking for that in any posting i can find.\n\nso i'm going to spend my summer learning the tooling. Not because i want to, but because the market is clear about what it wants.\n\nJust needed to rant somewhere that people would understand. is anyone else dealing with this or did i just pick the wrong two years to learn the fundamentals?",

I am assuming because its low level its universally valuable.  Its only valuable for research and theory, not in practice.  Years of layered abstraction has brought us out of the trenches to languages like python today.  And thus anyone with chatGPT can now write code and make apps.  \n\nI predict the same is going to happen in ML completely.  Acutally, it already has lol AWS Sagemaker \n\n[https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/mlops/](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/mlops/)\n\n Companies thrive off products and delivery not research:\n\n(bu the reserach papers inform product direction in AI)\n\nIf some companies wants metrics for customer churn rate, they dont care about the stack much less if the data science team used pen and paper.  They care about results, not complexity.  \\\\\"value\" is not  ML project set exposure, its engineering.\n\n(engineers just need to know the models and what problems to apply them to, not how to solve them on paper)\n\nEngineering perspective: How do you run multiple ML processes across teams simultaneously, enable testing, model experimentation, and deploy to the production app.  How do you decrease development time and monitor accuracy?\n\nBut I mean if you love the equations and you are great, find jobs where you push research further.  obviously thats way harder and more competitive but I cant see any other lane where the pen paper-ism is useful . \n\n  \nYou want to be ahead of where AI is going and plan for that, predict the market dont be a victim of it.

Majority of these companies dont undertand the concept of time. Yes you can over engineer and there is a possibility that ml/data pipelines finishes way faster, then you get your cloud bill or frontier model api bill and their assholes all of a sudden now hurt, because they didn't need that amount of speed and the bills that go along with it or they implemented dl model versus standard ml models for tabular data that they really didnt need to. Fuck what they think if you dont understand the way things how you learnt then they prolly are not the company for you. Majority of the time it's a toxic work environments where someone's gotta take the fall. The CTO at those companies are also prolly morons.

His micrograd and makemore walkthroughs are what inspired this project\n\nBooks:  \n\\- \"Understanding Deep Learning\" by Simon Prince — free PDF, excellent diagrams, goes from basics to modern architectures  \n\\- \"The Little Book of Deep Learning\" by François Fleuret — 170 pages, covers the entire field concisely. Also free\n\nBlogs/Interactive:  \n\\- Jay Alammar's blog (jalammar.github.io) — his \"Illustrated Transformer\" and \"Illustrated GPT-2\" posts are probably the best visual explanations of attention and transformers that exist  \n\\- [Distill.pub](https://distill.pub/) — sadly no longer active, but the existing articles are gold for interactive visual explanations of ML concepts\n\nThe approach I'd suggest: use 3Blue1Brown or Jay Alammar to build visual intuition for a concept, then open the corresponding no-magic script to see it as working code.

That's exactly the gap these scripts are meant to fill.\n\nFor going deeper into the math side specifically, here's the path I'd recommend:\n\n1. Start with backpropagation cold. Run microoptimizer and trace the gradient updates by hand for a few iterations. Once the chain rule feels mechanical rather than magical, everything else builds on top of it.\n\n2. Then work through the transformer stack: microtokenizer → microembedding → microgpt → microbert → microattention. By microattention, you'll be computing scaled dot-product attention manually and seeing exactly why the √d_k scaling exists — which is the kind of detail papers assume you already know.\n\n3. For the math foundations themselves: \"The Little Book of Deep Learning\" by François Fleuret (free PDF, 170 pages) is the most efficient math-first overview I've found. Pair it with 3Blue1Brown's neural network series for geometric intuition, and Karpathy's \"Neural Networks: Zero to Hero\" for the build-it-yourself approach.\n\n4. Once the basics are solid: microlora → microdpo → microppo → microgrpo traces the full alignment pipeline, and the math in DPO especially (the Bradley-Terry model, the policy gradient derivation) is worth working through on paper alongside the code.\n\nThe pattern that works: read the math, then open the script and find it in the code. The scripts are commented heavily enough that every equation from the paper has a corresponding line you can step through. That back-and-forth between notation and implementation is where real understanding happens.\n\nHappy to help if you get stuck on any specific script or concept.",

          "text": "At first sight, all the deficiencies of LLM transformer architecture are still here.\n\nFor example, proposed architecture uses standard Positional Embeddings added to token embeddings. These embeddings are fixed and learned specifically for the training context length. \n\nSo, if the model sees a sequence longer than it was trained on, for example,  block size 32 trained, but trying to infer on 33, the position embeddings fail, and the model performance collapses.\n\nAnd most obvious flaw: the model is still trained purely on Next-Token Prediction, predicting the immediate future.\n\nThis objective forces the model to be \"greedy\" and short-sighted. It optimizes for the statistically most probable next word, not necessarily the best long-term answer or logical deduction.",

              "text": "Good points — and yes, those limitations are still there.\n\nmicroGPT intentionally keeps the *vanilla* GPT design. It uses learned absolute positional embeddings tied to `block_size`, so it won’t generalize past the trained context length. That’s a known limitation of early GPT-style models. Modern systems use RoPE, ALiBi, etc., but microGPT avoids those on purpose — it’s meant to show the minimal core algorithm.\n\nOn next-token prediction: the model is trained to maximize  \nP(next\\_token | previous\\_tokens),  \nwhich factorizes the full joint distribution. So in theory it’s not inherently “short-sighted.” Greediness mainly comes from decoding strategy (e.g., greedy decoding vs sampling), not the objective itself.\n\nThat said, you’re right that NTP doesn’t explicitly optimize long-term planning or reasoning — that’s where things like RLHF, search, or structured reasoning techniques come in.\n\nmicroGPT isn’t trying to fix those issues — it’s trying to expose the fundamental Transformer mechanics as cleanly as possible.",

A good series of books on Analysis is by Elias Stein (Fourier, Real, Complex), the PhD advisor of Terence Tao. I'd recommend Fourier Analysis after Linear Algebra. It really reveals a completely new way of thinking about functions. It's basically a prerequisite for Functional Analysis.\n* You don't really need much Graph Theory other than the very basics (except for Graph Neural Networks) as far as I'm aware. Far more important is algorithms on graphs (depth first search, breadth first search, etc.).",

Like kernel SVM, quite difficult to derive since you need depth in optimization, is not being used anymore. For tabular data, xgboost is the go-to algorithm.\n\nBut all those concepts are built in modern frameworks. Numpy, Scikit learn, scipy, pytorch, tensorflow, and jax. Just learning to use these tools takes substantial amount time for individuals.\n\nAnd in production, the application field is moving so fast and it's becoming more important to make a useful product out of the tech stack.",

For example, Bayesian inference with a uniform prior can be shown to be equivalent to classic Maximum Likelihood Estimation.\n\nUniversity of Tubingen has a great lecture series on statistical learning theory by Ulrike von Luxburg, and also a phenomenal lecture series on probabilistic/Bayesian machine learning by Philipp Hennig. Both are available on YouTube. Highly, highly recommend them. Watching the von Luxburg lectures might be a good way to supplement your book based studies?

      "text": "A few weeks ago, Jane Street released a set of ML puzzles through the Dwarkesh podcast. Track 2 gives you a neural network that's been disassembled into 97 pieces (shuffled layers) and asks you to put it back together. You know it's correct when the reassembled model produces MSE = 0 on the training data and a SHA256 hash matches.\n\n\n\nWe solved it yesterday using a home lab — no cloud GPUs, no corporate cluster. Here's what the journey looked like without spoiling the solution.\n\n\n\n\\## The Setup\n\n\n\nOur \"cluster\" is the Cherokee AI Federation — a 5-node home network:\n\n\n\n\\- 2 Linux servers (Threadripper 7960X + i9-13900K, both with NVIDIA GPUs)\n\n\\- 2 Mac Studios (M1 Max 64GB each)\n\n\\- 1 MacBook Pro (M4 Max 128GB)\n\n\\- PostgreSQL on the network for shared state\n\n\n\nTotal cost of compute: electricity. We already had the hardware.\n\n\n\n\\## The Journey (3 days)\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Day 1-2: Distributed Simulated Annealing\\*\\*\n\n\n\nWe started where most people probably start — treating it as a combinatorial optimization problem. We wrote a distributed SA worker that runs on all 5 nodes, sharing elite solutions through a PostgreSQL pool with genetic crossover (PMX for permutations).\n\n\n\nThis drove MSE from \\~0.45 down to 0.00275. Then it got stuck. 172 solutions in the pool, all converged to the same local minimum. Every node grinding, no progress.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Day 3 Morning: The Basin-Breaking Insight\\*\\*\n\n\n\nInstead of running more SA, we asked a different question: \\*where do our 172 solutions disagree?\\*\n\n\n\nWe analyzed the top-50 pool solutions position by position. Most positions had unanimous agreement — those were probably correct. But a handful of positions showed real disagreement across solutions. We enumerated all valid permutations at just those uncertain positions.\n\n\n\nThis broke the basin immediately. MSE dropped from 0.00275 to 0.002, then iterative consensus refinement drove it to 0.00173.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Day 3 Afternoon: The Endgame\\*\\*\n\n\n\nFrom 0.00173 we built an endgame solver with increasingly aggressive move types:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Pairwise swap cascade\\*\\* — test all C(n,2) swaps, greedily apply non-overlapping improvements. Two rounds of this: 0.00173 → 0.000584 → 0.000253\n\n2. \\*\\*3-opt rotations\\*\\* — test all C(n,3) three-way rotations in both directions\n\n\n\nThe 3-opt phase is where it cracked open. Three consecutive 3-way rotations, each one dropping MSE by \\~40%, and the last one hit exactly zero. Hash matched.\n\n\n\n\\## The Key Insight\n\n\n\nThe reason SA got stuck is that the remaining errors lived in positions that required \\*\\*simultaneous multi-element moves\\*\\*. Think of it like a combination lock where three pins need to turn at exactly the same time — testing any single pin makes things worse.\n\n\n\nPairwise swaps can't find these. SA proposes single swaps. You need to systematically test coordinated 3-way moves to find them. Once we added 3-opt to the move vocabulary, it solved in seconds.\n\n\n\n\\## What Surprised Us\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Apple Silicon dominated.\\*\\* The M4 Max was 2.5x faster per-thread than our Threadripper on CPU-bound numpy. The final solve happened on the MacBook Pro.\n\n\\- \\*\\*Consensus analysis > more compute.\\*\\* Analyzing \\*where solutions disagree\\* was worth more than 10x the SA fleet time.\n\n\\- \\*\\*The puzzle has fractal structure.\\*\\* Coarse optimization (SA) solves 90% of positions. Medium optimization (swap cascades) solves the next 8%. The last 2% requires coordinated multi-block moves that no stochastic method will find in reasonable time.\n\n\\- \\*\\*47 seconds.\\*\\* The endgame solver found the solution in 47 seconds on the M4 Max. After 2 days of distributed SA across 5 machines. The right algorithm matters more than the right hardware.\n\n\n\n\\## Tech Stack\n\n\n\n\\- Python (torch, numpy, scipy)\n\n\\- PostgreSQL for distributed solution pool\n\n\\- No frameworks, no ML training, pure combinatorial optimization\n\n\\- Scripts: \\~4,500 lines across 15 solvers\n\n\n\n\\## Acknowledgment\n\n\n\nBuilt by the Cherokee AI Federation — a tribal AI sovereignty project. We're not a quant shop. We just like hard puzzles.\n\n",

      "text": "I've tasked Claude to scrape the dataset of Ycombinator companies currently hiring and try to find patterns, skills and tools that are most in demand for machine learning and AI jobs at these companies. \n\nThe dataset is clearly skewed towards the type of companies Ycombinator selects, which are currently very LLM/agent optimistic; on the other hand, these are very nimble and fast moving companies, and some of them could soon disrupt major players that are looking for other skills - so those more traditional roles and approaches might become harder to find in a few months or years. \n\nIn no way should this be seen as an attack against traditional ML approaches, data science and frontier model work; it's just a little data point for those with bills to pay and looking to dip their feet in this market. I found it interesting and share it here, maybe others will too. 100% LLM generated content follows after the line.\n\n\n_____________\n\n  Based on reading the 625 scraped jobs from WorkAtAStartup, here's my take:                                                                                                                                             \n  The Big Picture: Traditional ML Is Dead in Startup Land                                                                                                                                                                                    \n  The most striking finding is how completely LLM/agentic skills have displaced classical ML. Out of 37 jobs with AI in the title, only 2 are purely traditional ML (geospatial data science, physics simulation). Everything else assumes\n  you're building on top of foundation models, not training them from scratch.\n\n  The report's top skill — \"agents\" at 62% — is not a fluke. It reflects the dominant product pattern: companies are building vertical AI agents that do specific jobs (hospital operations, freight billing, sales outreach, insurance\n  processing). The role is less \"design a neural architecture\" and more \"orchestrate LLMs into reliable multi-step workflows.\"\n\nThe Skills That Actually Matter (In Priority Order)\n\nTier 1 — Non-negotiable:\n\n  - Python (59%) — universal baseline, no exceptions\n  - Agentic system design (62%) — tool calling, planning/execution loops, multi-agent orchestration. This is THE defining skill\n  - RAG pipelines — retrieval-augmented generation over domain-specific documents is in nearly every applied role\n  - LLM API fluency — knowing OpenAI, Anthropic/Claude, and how to prompt/fine-tune them effectively\n\nTier 2 — Strong differentiators:\n\n  - Evaluation frameworks — this is an emerging specialty. Companies like Sully.ai, goodfin, and Pylon explicitly call out \"LLM-as-judge,\" \"evaluation pipelines,\" and \"benchmarking\" as primary responsibilities. Knowing how to\n  systematically measure AI quality is becoming as important as building it\n  - AWS (51%) — cloud deployment is the default, AWS dominates\n  - TypeScript/React (39%) — AI engineers at startups are expected to be full-stack. You build the agent AND the UI\n  - Fine-tuning — more common than I expected. Companies like Persana AI and Conduit are going beyond prompting to actually fine-tune models for their domains\n\nTier 3 — Valuable but context-dependent:\n\n  - PyTorch (33%) — only matters if you're doing actual model training, not just API calls\n  - Docker/Kubernetes — infrastructure basics, expected but not the focus\n  - Vector databases / embeddings — important for RAG but becoming commoditized\n  - Go (21%) — surprisingly common, usually for backend/infra components alongside Python\n\nWhat the Market Does NOT Want\n\n  - Pure ML researchers — only ~3 roles in the entire dataset (Deepgram, Relace, AfterQuery). Startups aren't training foundation models\n  - CUDA/GPU optimization — 4 mentions out of 61 jobs. Leave this to NVIDIA and the hyperscalers\n  - Traditional data science (pandas, matplotlib, Jupyter notebooks) — the \"build dashboards and run A/B tests\" era is being replaced by \"build AI agents\"\n  - JAX, scikit-learn, classical ML frameworks — barely register\n\nThe Real Insight: \"AI Engineer\" Is a New Kind of Software Engineer\n\n  The most important takeaway isn't any single skill — it's that the \"AI Engineer\" role is fundamentally a software engineering role with AI as the primary tool. The best job descriptions (goodfin's Staff AI Engineer is the gold\n  standard) want someone who:\n\n  1. Understands LLM capabilities and limitations deeply\n  2. Can architect multi-step agentic systems that reason, not just generate\n  3. Builds evaluation infrastructure to know when things work\n  4. Ships production code with proper observability, error handling, and reliability\n  5. Thinks in product outcomes, not model metrics\n\n  goodfin's description nails it: \"The challenge is building systems that reason, compare tradeoffs, and surface uncertainty — not just generate fluent text.\"\n\nTwo Emerging Career Tracks Worth Watching\n\n  1. Forward Deployed AI Engineer — appeared at StackAI, HappyRobot, Phonely, Crustdata, and others. Part solutions engineer, part ML engineer. Deploys and adapts AI systems for enterprise customers. This didn't exist 2 years ago.\n  2. AI Evaluation Specialist — multiple companies now treat evals as a distinct discipline. Building automated evaluation pipelines, clinical-grade benchmarks, and LLM-as-judge systems is becoming its own specialization.\n\nBottom Line\n\n  If you're building an AI engineering skillset today, invest in: agentic system design, RAG, evaluation frameworks, and full-stack product building with Python + TypeScript. The market has clearly shifted from \"can you train a model?\"\n  to \"can you build a reliable AI product that does a real job?\"",

Stats helps you reason about uncertainty, bias, evaluation, and whether your system is actually working. Linear algebra helps you understand why embeddings, similarity, and dimensionality reduction behave the way they do. And classic ML teaches the discipline of modeling, debugging, and thinking in terms of data rather than just prompts.\n\nYou don’t need QKV-level depth unless you’re doing research, but having solid fundamentals makes your decisions sharper and your systems more reliable. It’s less about *how transformers multiply matrices* and more about *knowing when something is misleading, overfitting, or statistically weak*.\n\nSo yeah, you can skip parts of the traditional path if your goal is purely applied work.

I'll write about a very specific point which was drilled into me voluntarily by my 8 year old self. It has nothing to do with professional paths. I completely agree with the professional reasons of why you should peek behind the curtains.\n\n  \nI naturally forgot what was the name of the book, and what was the name of the fictional character, but there was a book by the legendary Isaac Asimov, most probably from the Robot series. There was a particular story/chapter where a person with the job robopsychologist says that over centuries, the human race had abstracted away so much of the inner workings of the intelligent beings, that their decisions and actions, which are at the end of the day, theoretically deterministic and entirely in the control of humans, were no longer plausible and controllable to the point where there was a person who did the job of robopsychologist, of talking to these robots and trying to comprehend their actions. The need for such dire measures arose due to severe abstraction.\n\nNow this is science fiction, and touch wood, we shall not face such problems any time soon, or within my lifetime atleast. But then, during the COVID era, I never dreamt that in the next 5 years, there would be a tool I could converse with and study for my exams efficiently. Even if you're not going into the full depths by reading PRML/ESLII/Goodfellow/etc., a simple understanding of weights, activation functions, basic intuition of attention mechanisms, etc. would really improve a person's throughput as an engineer in this field.\n\n\\[Note: I'm not in the industry as a working professional, I'm merely a sophomore. My opinions are based on whatever projects I've built, some of which won hackathons and from my internship stint at my country's number one AI startup\\]",

It's a recurring theme in teaching: when you draft a curriculum, what makes the cut?\n\n\\> What if a person wants to focus only on application layer above LLMs, can a person skip traditional ML learning path?\n\nOf course you can skip it. Should you? That depends on your context. Using a technology without understanding it is not a new concept. I have a fridge at home, but I don't know how it works. If my job was to repair refrigerators, I would want to know a thing or two about those. If my job was to make new refrigerators, I would want to know a thing or two (but different things) about fridges.\n\nSame with ML. What you need to learn is not universal. Are you in a position to just call an API and move on with your life? Are you orchestrating a distributed training pipeline? Are you optimizing model serving? Are you trying to beat a SOTA benchmark with a new model? Are you trying to understand how the current models work?\n\nFinally, in spite of all the jaw dropping advances in AI, there are still humans out there who just want to learn purely for learning's sake, believe it or not.",

It's split into 3 parts (courses).\n\n>Teach core concepts (bias-variance, overfitting, evaluation metrics) before tools\n\nPart 1 is loaded with 8 modules, 6 of which are all statistics, teaching you the foundations for this stuff.\n\nParts 2 and 3 cover evaluation metrics and bias-variance trade-off in detail.\n\n>Make you implement at least one algorithm from scratch\n\nAll parts make you implement algorithms from scratch the first time you see them, on subsequent labs, you can use external libraries.\n\n>Cover an end-to-end project, not just model training\n\nThe end-to-end project is the last class in the M.Eng program, unfortunately it's not on Coursera for us to at least attempt non-credit.",

          "text": "The list you have is a reasonable starting taxonomy, but the way industry actually works is quite different from how courses organize topics. Here's what matters in practice:\n\nWhat AI engineers actually do day-to-day:\n- Build and maintain RAG pipelines (retrieval, chunking, embedding, reranking)\n- Fine-tune models (LoRA, QLoRA, DPO) and evaluate outputs\n- Design agentic workflows (tool calling, routing, eval loops)\n- Optimize inference (quantization, KV caching, batching strategies)\n- Debug why things don't work — which requires understanding the internals, not just the API calls\n\nWhat that means for your study path:\n\nDon't try to learn those bullet points from your list as separate topics. They're deeply connected. LLMs use deep learning. RAG combines retrieval with LLMs. Gen AI is just the application layer on top of all of it. Learn them as a stack, not a checklist.\n\nMy recommended order:\n1. Python fluency — non-negotiable. You'll live in Python.\n2. Understand the core algorithms — transformers, attention, embeddings, backprop. Not from framework tutorials — from the actual math expressed as code. I put together 30 single-file, zero-dependency implementations of these algorithms for exactly this purpose: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/s/G0qj2zAEdw\n3. Build a RAG system end-to-end — this is the most common first project at any AI company right now\n4. Learn to evaluate — the gap between a demo and production is evaluation. Learn to measure whether your system actually works.\n5. Pick up infra basics — Docker, cloud deployment, API design. Companies need engineers who can ship, not just prototype.\n\nThe industry expectation that catches most people off guard: you're expected to debug and improve systems, not just build them. That requires knowing what's happening under the hood, not just which library to call.",
