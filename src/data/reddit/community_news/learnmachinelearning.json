Bonus points if you compare against GPU Pytorch/tensorflow to see how close you can get.\n\nAs a tip, making your benchmark be reproducible (eg as a script in your repo) is a good idea.\n\nThings to consider in your benchmark: in addition to full end to end training time, also consider more detailed analysis like: comparing data loading/preprocessing time, model forward time, model backward time, etc.\n\nAlso, ensuring that your implementation achieves similar loss/accuracy as equivalent implementations in Pytorch/tensorflow is a good sanity check that your implementation is correct.",

With that book and the one you show in the post, you will have already covered a large part of the introductory Machine Learning topics. One thing I really liked about those books is that almost 50% of the content consists of computer vision examples, an area that I love.\n\nFor that field, I recommend *Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision* as an intermediate level book, and *Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications* as intermediate–advanced. Unfortunately, in other fields that are not my specialty, such as LLMs, I cannot help you much.\n\nAnother somewhat hidden gem that I can recommend is *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow.\n\nThe truth is that, at a certain point, it stops being strictly about Machine Learning and starts revolving around FastAPI, Docker, and AWS (you know, ML in production). At that stage, the topics shift a bit and it is no longer about “the right model,” but about how it performs and scales in production.",

      "text": "Just last year, I was a software developer mostly creating web applications, working on backend services, APIs, and the regular CRUD operations using Python and JavaScript. Good job, good payment, but I thought I was missing the part of tech that was really thrilling. Currently, I work as an AI Engineer building applications based on LLM and deploying the models. It was a long journey of about 18 months, but it definitely paid off.\n\n If you are a programmer and think about changing your career path, here is the very same roadmap I utilized. It is hands on, aimed at quickly real stuff and makes use of your present coding abilities which is the major plus of AI engineering as it is 70% software development anyway. No PhD required just keep working on projects and acquire knowledge through practice.\n\n TIME & COST REALITY CHECK:\n\nReal talk on timeline and cost. I did this over 18 months while working full time about 10 to 15 hours per week on learning and projects.\n\nMonths 1-3 → Foundations\n\nMonths 4-10 → Core ML and DL + early projects\n\nMonths 11-18 → Modern AI, MLOps, portfolio, and job hunting.\n\nAlmost everything is free today like YouTube, official docs, Google Colab for GPUs. Self study works great for developers, but if you want structure and accountability, paid options help a lot.\n\nPHASE 1: How Basics are dealt with (1 TO 2 MONTHS):\n\nI already knew Python well, so I skipped the beginner stuff. But if your knowledge of python is not fresh, then spend a week on advanced topics like decorators, async, and virtual environments.\n\n Then, I dove into the math and ML foundations just enough to not feel lost:\n\n* Linear algebra, probability, and stats by Khan Academy videos + 3Blue1Brown's essence of linear algebra series.\n* Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera, the classic one, is free and explains things intuitively.\n\nThis gave me the \"why\" behind algorithms without overwhelming me.\n\n   \nPHASE 2: CORE MACHINE LEARNING & DEEP LEARNING (2 TO 3 MONTHS):\n\nI went ahead and got my hands dirty with the practical ML:\n\n* Fast ai's Practical Deep Learning course is a really good option. I got to create my own models from the very first day.\n* Next, I took Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization which is all about TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n\n The main libraries I learned were: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for the basics, followed by PyTorch which I took over TensorFlow because it is more Pythonic and dominant in 2025.\n\n The projects I worked on were simple but very important:\n\n1. Made a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering on a dataset from Kaggle.\n2. Conducted image classification with CNNs on the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n3. Performed sentiment analysis of Twitter data using NLP basics with the help of Hugging Face transformers early on.\n\nThey were all deployed on Streamlit for quick and easy web demonstrations that are super easy as a developer.\n\n RESOURCES & COURSES (WHAT ACTUALLY HELPED):\n\nI have such a clear mind about this. I was a full time earnings person. I needed live doubt clearing and project feedback. Watching recorded videos alone wasn’t enough. So here is how I looked at learning options.\n\nSelf Study resources:\n\n1. Coursera’s ML Specialization:\n\nStill the best for building strong ML foundations. Clear explanations, no noise.\n\n1. Fast ai:\n\nCompletely free and very practical. Helps you build intuition fast \n\nThese are amazing, but they require strong self discipline. I saved money this way, but progress can get slow if you are busy in office. Structured programs are better if you work full time.   \n  \n3. LogicMojo AI & ML Course : One option personally good for working developers is LogicMojo’s AI & ML program. I feel complex topic like Deeplearning and genAI you can only learn with projects. I feel this course was good for practical based approach for preparation.  \n  \nA few things that seemed useful for people who needed structure:\n\nIt goes from classic ML → Deep Learning → GenAI\n\n*  Strong focus on real projects\n* Includes DSA + system thinking.\n* Guided prep helps reduce trial and error during job switches\n\nThis is just one example similar cohort programs can work if they fit your schedule and learning style.\n\nMy honest take, \n\nSelf study = cheaper, flexible, but needs discipline. \n\nStructured programs = costlier, but keep you consistent and accountable\n\nThere is no arguably one \"best.\" Rather, there is a \"fit\" that attends to and collaborates with the schedule's energy in terms of learning style. The platform becomes inconsequential compared to the consistency.\n\n PHASE 3: DIVE INTO MODERN AI (3 TO 4 MONTHS):\n\nThis is where it got fun and where most AI engineer jobs are in 2025. Traditional ML is table stakes companies want people who can build with LLMs.\n\nResources:\n\n* LangChain docs and tutorials for chaining models, agents, etc.\n* Hugging Face courses on transformers and fine tuning.\n*  Pinecone for vector databases.\n\nProjects that leveled me up:\n\n1. A RAG chatbot: Uploaded PDFs, used embeddings + retrieval to answer questions with GPT-3.5 via OpenAI API. Added memory for conversation history.\n2. Custom fine tuned model: Took Llama 2 open source, fine tuned on a small dataset for code review.\n3. Multi modal app: Built an image captioning + question answering tool with CLIP and BLIP models.\n\nA very clean code GitHub repository with exhaustive README files and demonstrations was the primary reason for recruiters’ positive reaction to access to deployed apps.\n\n  \nPHASE 4: MLOPS, DEPLOYMENT, AND PRODUCTION BASICS (2 MONTHS):\n\nAs a developer, this was my superpower. AI folks often struggle with scaling, but I already knew Docker, etc.\n\nLearned:\n\n* FastAPI for building APIs around models.\n* Docker basics for containerizing.\n* For the purpose of tracking experiments, MLflow or Weights & Biases can be used.\n* In terms of cloud deployment, AWS SageMaker or GCP Vertex AI will be the choices.\n\nProject:\n\n1. Took my RAG app, containerized it, added monitoring for token usage, latency, and deployed to AWS. Simulated production issues like rate limits and fallbacks.\n\n\n\nMAJOR PROBLEM I FACED:\n\n* Math overload avoids paralysis by proof work in small incremental.Tutorial hell after every course and video, force yourself to build something original even if it is bad at first.\n* Skipping deployment early to deploy every project, even simple ones on Streamlit. Production problems teach way more than perfect Jupyter notebooks.\n* Burnout I only did deep work on weekends and evenings. Set small weekly goals, not daily marathons.\n\n \n\nPHASE 5: READY FOR INTERVIEWS (3 TO 6 MONTHS):\n\n* A construction of web pages representing oneself will be the main platform for five to six different projects with their live demos, source links, and discussions about problems.\n* Posted on LinkedIn about my progress, and contributed to open source.\n\n \n\nPHASE 6: INTERVIEW EXPERIENCE(QUESTIONS):\n\nML Interviews\n\n1. Most questions were about understanding and decision making, not math heavy theory.\n2. Explain the bias variance tradeoff in simple terms\n3. Why are neural networks usually not the first choice for tabular data?\n4. How do you handle imbalanced datasets in real projects?\n5. How would you evaluate and monitor a model in production, not just offline?\n\n \n\nCoding Rounds:\n\n1. Coding was not hardcore DSA.\n2. Python data manipulation (Pandas, lists, dictionaries)\n3. ML related logic problems\n4. Focus on clarity and correctness, not LeetCode hard puzzles.\n\n\n\nSystem Design:\n\n1. These rounds tested how well you think end-to-end.\n2. Design an AI recommendation system\n3. Design a fraud detection system\n4. Design a chatbot architecture (LLM + backend + data flow)\n\n \n\nKey takeaway: Interviewers valued structured thinking and clear answers over \"correct\" ones.\n\nSwitching to AI is not about knowing everything. It is about building the right skills, thinking clearly, and showing real world impact through projects. This is just one path, not the only one. If you are consistent and focus on real projects, the transition is very doable especially if you already have software experience.\n\n",

If you want to start, the first thing every source of information will lead you to is classical ML Linear Regression California Housing Price prediction. Next is classification use case, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning etc. Once you learn a few ML algorithms, then you'd build an end to end ML project. Neural Network is the natural next step. This would bring you to tensorflow and pytorch. From here, application development with LLM is next step. Then deployment. Personally for me, I already knew MERN stack, learnt FastAPI so building chatbots was pretty straightforward.\n\nI dived in to all this with the mindset of having a good understanding of everything about ML/AI. From that standpoint, this roadmap unfolds automatically.\n\nThis roadmap does not stop, once you are able to build applications, RAG, MCP, agents etc, its now the question of optimization. Why one thing over the other? System design basically.",

Then I got into building telephone chatbots (before they were cool) and then learned some linear algebra as a consequence of wanting to understand convolutions better. \n\nIMO just follow what you find interesting and make sure you understand what’s going on. Who cares if you do linear regression or whatever. I don’t like formulaic learning. Sure most courses teach things in a similar way, so if you want to be like everyone else then you can take them i guess. And that’s not to say they aren’t worthwhile, those two things aren’t mutually exclusive.\n\nI agree with you that the roadmap unfolds automatically which is why I asked if the OP was backwards-fitting to his experience. I think largely, people who are “successful” at something don’t rely on run of the mill roadmap posts on reddit lol. You’ve already opened the wrong door as soon as you start looking for a 12-month roadmap tbh.",

          "text": "This weekend, after writing about Prof. Bernie Widrow, I started thinking more about his style of research.\n\nFirst, Dr. Widrow was fundamentally an engineer. His goal was to solve real world problems that actually mattered. That is rare, and it genuinely benefited society. In contrast, much highly influential academic research does not aim to fully solve a problem, but instead points to a promising direction for addressing a broader class of problems. Of course, this does not mean Prof. Widrow’s work was not influential. It was influential in a different, and often more direct, way.\n\nSecond, Dr. Widrow kept moving into new areas and made contributions across many fields. When he realized that the computational bottleneck of neural networks exceeded what was feasible at the time, he shifted his focus to other equally important topics, such as adaptive filters, quantization, noise cancellation, and medical devices. Modern phones would not work nearly as well without his contributions. This breadth is also remarkable. At the same time, it can make recognition uneven, because foundational work across multiple areas is harder to summarize under a single label, and people may think, “Bernie is already well known for something else.”\n\nI was once advised by a highly respected researcher whose style was quite similar to Dr. Widrow’s. He told me that academia is built around a reward system. If your work helps enable others to be rewarded, your work is more likely to be rewarded as well. If you write only one paper a year, or every other year, and that paper fully solves an important problem, your work may be overlooked for a long enough period that the reward never arrives.\n\nThere is no right or wrong style of research. Enjoying the process matters most. In the end, everyone reaches the same destination, although some leave deeper marks on the world than others.",

If eg you are trying to gauge your level from this, every other person with their knowledge or past courses would make similarly esoteric lists most of which you would not be able to answer despite having taking this course.\n\nSome are fundamental and great to learn or at least something in the vicinity of that, and even better if you get the generalizing principles and intuition. Most as formulated will come up in the course or not depending only on the particular professor you have.\n\nThe focus will be different for different courses and you will forget most of the stuff that you do not use, especially the niche stuff.\n\nEven if you do not use some of these things directly though, they can still be good at building intuition, prepare you for a next step where you do use it, develop the ability and confidence to learn and apply complex material, and knowledge that is more general than these specific questions - such as how the discipline allows for the formalization of machine-learning problems which turn into practical solutions.\n\nFor a course, I think it is sensible, but if you go back to this post in ten years, you will probably scratch your head a lot.\n\n>To all those who are angry and say these things are absurd or useless: well, that’s because you don’t do research in ML.\n\nYour questions was for ML engineering so that is the context you should assume for the responses. If you now change to ML research, that seems to mean your question is confused.\n\nThere's an endless sea of things you can learn in ML.

                  "text": "This makes sense. To me, they look like questions from quizzes or an exam for a specific class (honestly, from multiple classes). Class specific questions are often designed to test your recall and comprehension of specifically what was covered, regardless of whether that knowledge is especially relevant elsewhere. I wouldn't even expect these to come up all together in a viva or exam of some sort which is testing you at the end of the whole degree.\n\nEspecially the one that mentions SimCLR looks like such a specific question referencing the particular demonstrative examples used in class, rather than an actual comparison of things anyone outside that class would be expected to automatically recognize. Lecturers use examples they know or which are useful for demonstrating a specific point - that doesn't necessarily mean you will ever need to consider those specific examples in the future.\n\nThis isn't even about the theoretical knowledge needed for research vs practice. It's about reviewing specifically what things were covered in the course, for the purpose of demonstrating or examining a broader concept or way of thinking, which is the important part. \n\nI've used the specific knowledge and concepts covered in the linear regression, dropout, and multitask prediction questions in doing my ML research. But not any of the others. No single researcher is using all of these concepts in their research and certainly not off the top of their head.\n\nIt's useful in teaching and in practice to be able to think and talk comparatively about different methods and algorithms for a particular task, but it's unlikely someone not doing work specifically in contrastive learning would need to know those specific methods. And a researcher would likely need to be familiar with several other approaches. \n\nDon't confuse (or dismiss!) the pedagogical approach used to demonstrate a concept that is crucial to know with specific knowledge needed in practice. Just because your professor introduced certain papers or methods doesn't mean they are the most relevant or comprehensive; but it also doesn't mean they're irrelevant. They may have been useful specifically for teaching the concept the professor wanted you to understand and that's it. \n\nTo your last point, as someone who very much does do research in ML (and teaches it), what is absurd is the idea that even a researcher in ML would need to be able to answer the set of these very specific questions. They'd be able to for the one or two relevant to their research and have only a surface level off hand knowledge of the others.",

On top of that, the original UDA article that coined the term \"gradient reversal layer\" does not even mention gradient ascent, because it is closer to a regularization (and for efficiency reasons).",

I might have known them before and still know the general concept but not remember the specific term (I bet this is the case for most AI/DL people who learned about Moore Penrose but haven't needed to dive deep into linear regression since uni) or for some (like simCLR) I've just not read the relevant paper or needed what it does so I have never even heard of it. \n\nA lot of them are irrelevant to actually doing ML, others would maybe show up specifically in a quiz for a specialized class or only at the end of the textbook chapter and others are just poorly formed.\n\nAs others have said, they feel like they're from someone who is a bit insecure in their competence and trying to show off to compensate. Or from someone who is going through a textbook and temporarily feels confident but hasn't actually used the concepts for long enough to know what knowledge sticks around.\n\nTo expand on the 'textbook questions' point: I know some of the guys who have written these textbooks and for the most part even they couldn't answer every single revision question at the end of all their chapters without reviewing. Advanced textbooks are comprehensive, but for a lot of specific points, only 1 in 100 professionals would actually regularly need to retain that knowledge and no single professional needs 100% of it. So asking a bunch of very specific questions as a universal quiz will necessarily mean some talented people will get some while others will get other questions, but basically no one would get them all.\n\nSo someone who needs to retain knowledge about Moore Penrose vs gradient descent in linear regression probably isn't the same person who needs to know about layers in fine tuning, isn't the person who remembers specifics of General Continual Learning. They may have used it once or read about it, but no one needs to retain all of this together.",

A hiring manager trying get second opinions on questions for topic in which he is not prepared, which is just bad practice\n\nThe list could go on ad nauseum.\n\nYes, the formatting of the questions is also not that great, which is why I suspected someone might be using a local LLM (usually not some of the better AI out there) to create these questions. Formatting questions, especially for a course in which students are graded, is a sore subject amongst pretty much anyone that has ever paid their own money to go to university. We all expect professionalism when we pay for a service, and these questions haven't even been peer reviewed for formatting, let alone content.\n\nFor the record, I'm not mad. I'm just stating that this isn't anyone's best work and that I wouldn't even sit this quiz in any type of professional setting. In University, I'd pick it up, go correct it at home, and then request an audience with the Department Head or Dean in order to lodge a formal complaint.

You could draw an error vector orthogonal to the regression line, or not, depends on the definition.\n\n3. DL uses the flipped version of math convolution, but this is irrelevant to anything important. I never used scipy convolution so idk, pytorch uses flipped.\n\n4. Regularizes model by randomly zeroing out params\n\n5. It stops the latent distribution from just memorizing the inputs, so a random latent vector would have sensible meaning. \n\n6. Not familiar with multitask learning loss\n\n7. Not familiar with these, but I've seen the terms.\n\n8. Freeze early layers, you assume the early layers encode some meaningful latent vector the last layers can operate on.\n\n9. Never seen the term reversal gradient\n\n10. Never heard of dark experience replay\n\n11. Temperature adds noise to the teachers vector so the student learns more generally\n\n12. I use the methods and know how they work when I search it up, but idk off the top of my head cause I don't use them frequently\n\n13. I haven't heard of ewc",

So if the error vector is in C(A), it is not orthogonal to N(A). I'm not sure about this next part, but I was hazard that l2 regularization does not change the dimension of the error vector.

In a 'winner takes all' type of a setup where only a few corporations will produce models, smaller companies will not have the data or the GPUs. The rest of us will simply just use these models and make agents or something similar.  \n\n  \nSo it is actually worth learning about how a neural network is built and how it is trained and get into the details of the loss curves and gradient descent?

Try to solve a problem with ML instead of focusing on the individual elements. \n\n\nSo make a dataset, annotate it, train a model (yolo is fun), do a couple revisions, then try a test deployment with QC. This process will teach you more about ML than an in depth analysis of the math. \n\n\nEssentially all models are data limited. Even the large LLMs now! This means the math can accommodate more data but we have none to give. So the math and model aren't limiting its how fast you can collect and annotate data. This has to be done in the real so is slow, costly and painful. \n\n\nIf I could buy 100 engineers 80 would be dataset collectors / annotaters / QC, 10, would be pipeline and infrastructure, 5 would be deployment, 5 would be model development. A major change in model can be revolutionary,  see transformers, but this is a Longshot once a decade thing. For a product brute force with off the shelf tools is usually the answer. ",

I sat through an academic talk recently where the speaker was saying that ML is transitioning into a “stage 3” development, where he defined “stage 1” as being foundational where people are all coming up with their own architectures, “stage 2” as being applied where there is a consensus on what architectures to be used (e.g. transformer based architectures) but individual groups would all be training their own models, to stage 3 where it makes the most sense to simply take a trained model (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) and then either fine-tune it or just use it as a tool on its own rather than trying to train it yourself. There is an analogy with the simulation tools used in physics and engineering like COMSOL or Ansys (if you are familiar with those). People used to write their own simulation code, but now it makes the most sense to just buy a license for existing supported frameworks. Circling back to your original question, does it make sense to understand the inner workings of ML models & architectures? Maybe not in your case, however personally I have always found it advantageous to understand what’s going on “under the hood” when troubleshooting things, in the same way that one can be a better software engineer if they also understand some of the computer architecture/hardware that is actually driving the whole process.",

I’ve also explicitly listed **projects at each stage**, because I believe understanding without building is incomplete.\n\nI’m sharing this publicly **not because I think it’s perfect**, but because I want it to be **as complete and accurate as possible**.\n\nIf you:\n\n* Think something important is missing\n* Disagree with the ordering of topics\n* Believe a phase should include or exclude something\n* Have suggestions that would make this roadmap more correct or practical\n\nI’d genuinely appreciate your feedback.\n\nMy goal is not to promote a “personal plan,” but to refine this into a **useful reference for anyone trying to learn AI/ML seriously without paid courses**.\n\n",

My method, and I recommend developing/refining your own, is to first read the abstract and decide if the subject, findings, and methods referenced there are aligned with my current research area(s). If not, discard and move on.  If they are, I skip to the end and check the conclusion and perform a similar check.  Then I skim to mostly read section intro sentences and look for verbs/highlighted/italicized sections that indicate the author needed to make an important point. From there, I will note anything I need to reference, such as diagrams, equations, or key paragraphs.  Then, if it still has my atteniton, I start digesting in reading order.  I tend to flip back and forth a lot, referencing diagrams, equations, and other paragraphs.  During this phase, if I find something absurd, nonsensical, or if it's clear that this is advertising cloaked as academia, I bail.  If I get through that phase, I tend to start over and read it all the way through at least once more.  Some of the dense or advanced papers, I read multiple times and take notes. If I need to, Ill bookmark it in a folder to review later once I have had time to think through the findings.\n\nWorks for me, but again, I recommend working out your own method.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’m finishing my master’s and starting to interview for ML/AI engineer roles. I put together a plan to get myself interview-ready in 2 months. \n\nWould really appreciate feedback from people who’ve been through this recently anything you’d change or add? \n\nWeek 1 — Python\n\nI want to be able to write clean Python outside of Jupyter:\n\n\t•\tfunctions, loops, data structures\n\n\t•\treading/writing files\n\n\t•\tone small script that loads a CSV → cleans a bit → trains something simple\n\nWeek 2 — Classical ML + Metrics\n\nStuff every ML interview asks:\n\n\t•\tLogistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM (just the intuition)\n\n\t•\ttrain/val/test split\n\n\t•\tprecision/recall/F1, ROC-AUC, etc.\n\n\t•\tsimple comparison of two models and being able to explain why one is better\n\nWeek 3 — Data Preprocessing + Feature Engineering\n\nBecause real-world data is a mess:\n\n\t•\tmissing values, outliers, encoding, scaling\n\n\t•\thandling imbalance\n\n\t•\tdata leakage (apparently a favorite curveball)\n\n\t•\treusable preprocessing pipeline\n\nWeek 4 — One Solid End-to-End Project\n\nNot 10 Kaggle clones. One good project I can explain well:\n\n\t•\tclear problem → data → model → evaluation\n\n\t•\tclean repo + short write-up of what worked and what didn’t\n\nWeek 4.5 — Quick NLP Basics\n\nJust enough to survive “here’s some text, go build a classifier” interview questions:\n\n\t•\tbasic text cleaning\n\n\t•\tTF-IDF\n\n\t•\tsimple text classification (like spam vs not spam)\n\n\t•\tbeing able to code it without freezing\n\nWeek 5 — Deployment\n\nI’ve noticed this impresses interviewers more than a fancy model:\n\n\t•\tFastAPI/Flask endpoint for inference\n\n\t•\tDocker so it’s easy to run\n\n\t•\tbasic docs on how to use it\n\nWeek 6 — Debugging + Reasoning\n\nInterviewers love “what if…” questions:\n\n\t•\tbias vs variance\n\n\t•\tfalse positives vs false negatives\n\n\t•\twhat to try if results suck\n\n\t•\tshort doc on “how I’d improve this in v2”\n\nWeek 7 — Coding + Communication\n\n\t•\tLeetCode easy/medium\n\n\t•\tPandas/SQL style questions\n\n\t•\tpractice explaining my project like a human, not a textbook\n\nWeek 8 — Mock Interviews + Cleanup\n\n\t•\ttech + behavioral mocks\n\n\t•\timproving weak spots\n\n\t•\tclean up GitHub and LinkedIn",

          "text": "I've done quite a lot of hiring recently. Looking at your plan, I would add object oriented programming into your Python fundamentals. Why? Well, for example, if you need to build your own deep learning models in Pytorch, you'll need to understand class inheritance and composition. Also, most codebases you'll end up contributing to will require that you understand classes, abstract classes, enums, data classes, and, increasingly, pydantic models.\n\nAdditionally, and this may be a little anecdotal, a lot of people applying for AIML jobs in the past two years or so are clearly trying to jump on the AI hype train without any deeper interest. Consequently, they do not develop sufficient expertise, because people underestimate how much math they'll need. What I'm trying to say is, your recruiting manager will likely have seen many people like that, so you'll benefit from coming across as someone who has a strong interest in AIML, beyond just thinking that ChatGPT is cool. You can demonstrate this by being able to have a conversation about AIML topics, complete with the tradeoffs of different approaches and an ability to explain your choices (no, \"I used this approach because it's the best one,\" and crickets).\n\nGood luck!",

          "text": "Honestly speaking, the hard parts in ML are math theory and hardcore statistics and probability (especially for some models like Gaussian Processes).\n\nThe engineering part is much easier: you can just do some learning projects yourself and you're set. Perhaps the most involved part are the cloud services, but only because you have to pay for them to get your hands dirty.\n\nWith that said, to answer your question, you can just use the official docs for some tools and build some learning projects by yourself:\n\n- Building end-to-end applications (Wrappers, front-end integration): as long as you know Pandas, Polars or PySpark, you will be able to create your own pipelines. Also, learn some data quality library (such as Great Expectations or Pandera)\n\nDeployment & MLOps (Docker, FastAPI, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP): just learn FastAPI to create a server that accepts requests with feature values, and uses your trained model to perform a .predict() to return a prediction. Then, write a Dockerfile that uses your FastAPI app and serves it with Uvicorn, creating a Docker container. Honestly, learning Kubernetes nowadays is an overkill for someone in the ML field, as most companies just deploy using whatever their cloud provider gives you, instead of using \"barebones\" kubernetes, just because it is easier (at the cost of some vendot lock-in).\n\nModern AI Stack (LLMs, RAG, LangChain, Vector DBs): for LLM projects you can just burn some money with the OpenAI API or hosting your own little local LLM. To perform a RAG, learning a bit of LangChain and LangGraph should be enough. As for vector DBs, see what LangChain docs say about it to choose one and follow their tutorial.\n\nProductionization (Handling real traffic, latency, monitoring): most companies that have this kind of problem have large engineering teams who already build/buy solutions for this. Perhaps you can learn how to use OpenTelemetry to generate logs for a FastAPI app to have observability data (latency, error rates...). To handle large traffic, understanding asynchronous programming through FastAPI is usually enough, as you can scale a FastAPI app through your cloud provider (or Uvicorn locally with many processes). An alternative to FastAPI would be a more OotB solution such as BentoML.\n\nIn a nutshell: you won't find good books about this, or courses. The reason is that most of those tools or building blocks are not ML-specific. On top of that, most companies never get to have these problems, as their ML never leaves a notebook. The companies that actually have solid ML processes have large teams of people who handle different parts of the process, who got their specialized knowledge through learning docs, doing projects on their own and figuring out stuff as they need it",

It uses manual backpropagation with a gradient check in the notebook.\n\nI built this to help myself visualize the gears of the architecture of a language model, and I hope it can be a useful reference for others too.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/dbrll/BareGPT\n\nI'd love to get your feedback on the implementation.",

I trained a custom GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) specifically on floral datasets to see if I could generate images indistinguishable from macro photography.\n\n**The Model:**\n\n* **Architecture:** I used a DCGAN built from scratch with PyTorch.\n* **Dataset:** Trained on \\~2k images of flowers from the Oxford 102.\n* **Training:** Trained for >3000 epochs using an H100 on Google Collab.\n\n**The Turing Test:** To evaluate the model's quality, I wrapped it in a web application called [**Neural Nector**](https://neuralnector.com/). It presents you with a grid of real vs. generated images and asks you to select the fakes.\n\n* Scoring with **F1 Score** (Harmonic mean of precision and recall) rather than simple accuracy to penalize both false positives (calling a real flower fake) and false negatives (not finding the fakes).\n* The goal is to gather data on which \"tells\" (e.g., petal symmetry, background noise) people use to identify the fakes so **please leave your feedback.**\n\n**Live Demo / Test:** You can try to distinguish the GAN outputs here: [https://neuralnector.com](https://neuralnector.com/)\n\n**Technical Implementation:** [https://github.com/TheBoyRoy05/NeuralNector](https://github.com/TheBoyRoy05/NeuralNector), the training notebooks can be found models/GAN.",

OpenAI in particular is using the \"AGI is just around the corner!\" narrative to keep investors strung along.\n\nWhen expectations are set too high, disillusionment is inevitable, and disillusionment causes backlash, in the form of withdrawn funding -- venture capitalists stop investing in AI companies, customers stop buying \"AI\" products and services (but will continue buying them as \"Business Intelligence\" and \"Analytics\"), and academics switch to other fields to chase grants.\n\nAI technology doesn't go away in an AI Winter, [but it isn't considered \"AI\" anymore,](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect) the \"AI\" label ceases to be a marketing draw, and it loses a lot of its popular allure.\n\nMany of the technologies which came out of the second AI Summer are still with us today, and continue to be developed and used, but nobody considers them \"AI\" anymore and they are mostly the bailiwick of technical professionals.

Then, people who go to AI to “fact check” something can encounter the slop and take it as true.  One prominent example was that whole “glue in pizza sauce to adhere toppings” kerfuffle that happened a while ago.  That was a funny joke that was well upvoted on Reddit and when the data set was used for training, it was probably included because it seemed logical that a highly upvoted comment would be useful to include.  I assume that type of issue has been at least partially solved, but I bet that kind of problem is impossible to fully solve.  \n\nThink of some area of knowledge where you are an expert and you really know your stuff.  Have you seen errors on Reddit about that topic where a few people have it right, but the overall consensus upvotes something that is incorrect?  That’s gonna get trained into AI.   As the cycle repeats, we end up drifting from the truth.",
