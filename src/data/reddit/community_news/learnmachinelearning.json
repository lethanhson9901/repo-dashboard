Felt like i actually understood what was happening inside models instead of just running library calls.\n\nThen i started looking at internship postings.\n\nevery single one, even the ones titled \"data science intern\" or \"ml research intern\" is asking for:\n\n[Langchain.com](https://www.langchain.com/) and [Heyneo.so](http://heyneo.so) for building pipelines, OpenAI API and Anthropic Claude for LLM integration, [pinecone.io](http://pinecone.io) or [weaviate.io](http://weaviate.io) for vector databases, Hugging Face for model access, LlamaIndex for RAG, fine-tuning experience, prompt engineering, evals.\n\nNot one posting mentioned bayesian inference. not one mentioned hypothesis testing. nobody cares about SVMs or classical regression or time series fundamentals. one job description literally listed \"vibe coding\" as a desirable skill for a data science internship. vibe coding.\n\nI understand the market has moved. companies are building LLM products. the tooling has shifted, I'm not saying that's wrong.\n\nBut it feels like two years of building mathematical foundations just became irrelevant overnight. the statistical intuition i built, the ability to read a paper and understand what's actually happening, the deep model understanding, nobody is asking for that in any posting i can find.\n\nso i'm going to spend my summer learning the tooling. Not because i want to, but because the market is clear about what it wants.\n\nJust needed to rant somewhere that people would understand. is anyone else dealing with this or did i just pick the wrong two years to learn the fundamentals?",

That’s mainly because once you backtest your model in Quant you want it to do exactly what it was trained on, ie no hallucinations that could blow up your account. I’m sure LLM still has its place but the traditional ML is still very much not dead. \n\nNow I cannot speak to other fields as I don’t work in them, but the logic still applies. Gotta find niche roles where the demand for non LLM models is high. They’re out there if you look.",

Ironically, the same problem could have been solved using Bayesian inference at a fraction of the cost without that running out of context problem. \n\nTraditional machine learning is still highly relevant, even if it isn’t as hyped. If a problem can be solved with statistical ML methods, organizations will often prefer them, maybe not today but in the long run because they are significantly cheaper than LLM-based solutions.",

Don't negate real skills.\n\nEdit: \n\nJust cram for the interview on the tools they are using. You can either fake your enthusiasm for those tools or acknowledge you are learning them with a deep base in the foundational knowledge they are using.",

His micrograd and makemore walkthroughs are what inspired this project\n\nBooks:  \n\\- \"Understanding Deep Learning\" by Simon Prince — free PDF, excellent diagrams, goes from basics to modern architectures  \n\\- \"The Little Book of Deep Learning\" by François Fleuret — 170 pages, covers the entire field concisely. Also free\n\nBlogs/Interactive:  \n\\- Jay Alammar's blog (jalammar.github.io) — his \"Illustrated Transformer\" and \"Illustrated GPT-2\" posts are probably the best visual explanations of attention and transformers that exist  \n\\- [Distill.pub](https://distill.pub/) — sadly no longer active, but the existing articles are gold for interactive visual explanations of ML concepts\n\nThe approach I'd suggest: use 3Blue1Brown or Jay Alammar to build visual intuition for a concept, then open the corresponding no-magic script to see it as working code.

That's exactly the gap these scripts are meant to fill.\n\nFor going deeper into the math side specifically, here's the path I'd recommend:\n\n1. Start with backpropagation cold. Run microoptimizer and trace the gradient updates by hand for a few iterations. Once the chain rule feels mechanical rather than magical, everything else builds on top of it.\n\n2. Then work through the transformer stack: microtokenizer → microembedding → microgpt → microbert → microattention. By microattention, you'll be computing scaled dot-product attention manually and seeing exactly why the √d_k scaling exists — which is the kind of detail papers assume you already know.\n\n3. For the math foundations themselves: \"The Little Book of Deep Learning\" by François Fleuret (free PDF, 170 pages) is the most efficient math-first overview I've found. Pair it with 3Blue1Brown's neural network series for geometric intuition, and Karpathy's \"Neural Networks: Zero to Hero\" for the build-it-yourself approach.\n\n4. Once the basics are solid: microlora → microdpo → microppo → microgrpo traces the full alignment pipeline, and the math in DPO especially (the Bradley-Terry model, the policy gradient derivation) is worth working through on paper alongside the code.\n\nThe pattern that works: read the math, then open the script and find it in the code. The scripts are commented heavily enough that every equation from the paper has a corresponding line you can step through. That back-and-forth between notation and implementation is where real understanding happens.\n\nHappy to help if you get stuck on any specific script or concept.",

These embeddings are fixed and learned specifically for the training context length. \n\nSo, if the model sees a sequence longer than it was trained on, for example,  block size 32 trained, but trying to infer on 33, the position embeddings fail, and the model performance collapses.\n\nAnd most obvious flaw: the model is still trained purely on Next-Token Prediction, predicting the immediate future.\n\nThis objective forces the model to be \"greedy\" and short-sighted. It optimizes for the statistically most probable next word, not necessarily the best long-term answer or logical deduction.",

It uses learned absolute positional embeddings tied to `block_size`, so it won’t generalize past the trained context length. That’s a known limitation of early GPT-style models. Modern systems use RoPE, ALiBi, etc., but microGPT avoids those on purpose — it’s meant to show the minimal core algorithm.\n\nOn next-token prediction: the model is trained to maximize  \nP(next\\_token | previous\\_tokens),  \nwhich factorizes the full joint distribution. So in theory it’s not inherently “short-sighted.” Greediness mainly comes from decoding strategy (e.g., greedy decoding vs sampling), not the objective itself.\n\nThat said, you’re right that NTP doesn’t explicitly optimize long-term planning or reasoning — that’s where things like RLHF, search, or structured reasoning techniques come in.\n\nmicroGPT isn’t trying to fix those issues — it’s trying to expose the fundamental Transformer mechanics as cleanly as possible.",

Number Theory, Complex Analysis, Category Theory. \n* You really just need up to ODEs and Probability and Statistics.\n* I'm sure Differential Geometry has its place in Machine/Deep Learning, but I've not encountered a scenario where it is absolutely necessary.\n* PDEs, Measure Theory and Functional Analysis have some applications if you want to study the theory behind StableDiffusion.\n* Fourier Analysis (not listed) would be far more important for audio and probably vision as well. A good series of books on Analysis is by Elias Stein (Fourier, Real, Complex), the PhD advisor of Terence Tao. I'd recommend Fourier Analysis after Linear Algebra. It really reveals a completely new way of thinking about functions. It's basically a prerequisite for Functional Analysis.\n* You don't really need much Graph Theory other than the very basics (except for Graph Neural Networks) as far as I'm aware. Far more important is algorithms on graphs (depth first search, breadth first search, etc.).",

By the time you finish buidling knowledge you need multivariable calculus, linear algebra, probabilty theory, statistics, information theory, optimization theory, and numerical analysis studied.\n\nFrankly some important concepts are not relevant anymore. Like kernel SVM, quite difficult to derive since you need depth in optimization, is not being used anymore. For tabular data, xgboost is the go-to algorithm.\n\nBut all those concepts are built in modern frameworks. Numpy, Scikit learn, scipy, pytorch, tensorflow, and jax. Just learning to use these tools takes substantial amount time for individuals.\n\nAnd in production, the application field is moving so fast and it's becoming more important to make a useful product out of the tech stack.",

For example, Bayesian inference with a uniform prior can be shown to be equivalent to classic Maximum Likelihood Estimation.\n\nUniversity of Tubingen has a great lecture series on statistical learning theory by Ulrike von Luxburg, and also a phenomenal lecture series on probabilistic/Bayesian machine learning by Philipp Hennig. Both are available on YouTube. Highly, highly recommend them. Watching the von Luxburg lectures might be a good way to supplement your book based studies? That said I have no idea how advanced the book you're working through is so the lectures might be too advanced for the book or vice versa",

      "text": "A few weeks ago, Jane Street released a set of ML puzzles through the Dwarkesh podcast. Track 2 gives you a neural network that's been disassembled into 97 pieces (shuffled layers) and asks you to put it back together. You know it's correct when the reassembled model produces MSE = 0 on the training data and a SHA256 hash matches.\n\n\n\nWe solved it yesterday using a home lab — no cloud GPUs, no corporate cluster. Here's what the journey looked like without spoiling the solution.\n\n\n\n\\## The Setup\n\n\n\nOur \"cluster\" is the Cherokee AI Federation — a 5-node home network:\n\n\n\n\\- 2 Linux servers (Threadripper 7960X + i9-13900K, both with NVIDIA GPUs)\n\n\\- 2 Mac Studios (M1 Max 64GB each)\n\n\\- 1 MacBook Pro (M4 Max 128GB)\n\n\\- PostgreSQL on the network for shared state\n\n\n\nTotal cost of compute: electricity. We already had the hardware.\n\n\n\n\\## The Journey (3 days)\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Day 1-2: Distributed Simulated Annealing\\*\\*\n\n\n\nWe started where most people probably start — treating it as a combinatorial optimization problem. We wrote a distributed SA worker that runs on all 5 nodes, sharing elite solutions through a PostgreSQL pool with genetic crossover (PMX for permutations).\n\n\n\nThis drove MSE from \\~0.45 down to 0.00275. Then it got stuck. 172 solutions in the pool, all converged to the same local minimum. Every node grinding, no progress.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Day 3 Morning: The Basin-Breaking Insight\\*\\*\n\n\n\nInstead of running more SA, we asked a different question: \\*where do our 172 solutions disagree?\\*\n\n\n\nWe analyzed the top-50 pool solutions position by position. Most positions had unanimous agreement — those were probably correct. But a handful of positions showed real disagreement across solutions. We enumerated all valid permutations at just those uncertain positions.\n\n\n\nThis broke the basin immediately. MSE dropped from 0.00275 to 0.002, then iterative consensus refinement drove it to 0.00173.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Day 3 Afternoon: The Endgame\\*\\*\n\n\n\nFrom 0.00173 we built an endgame solver with increasingly aggressive move types:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Pairwise swap cascade\\*\\* — test all C(n,2) swaps, greedily apply non-overlapping improvements. Two rounds of this: 0.00173 → 0.000584 → 0.000253\n\n2. \\*\\*3-opt rotations\\*\\* — test all C(n,3) three-way rotations in both directions\n\n\n\nThe 3-opt phase is where it cracked open. Three consecutive 3-way rotations, each one dropping MSE by \\~40%, and the last one hit exactly zero. Hash matched.\n\n\n\n\\## The Key Insight\n\n\n\nThe reason SA got stuck is that the remaining errors lived in positions that required \\*\\*simultaneous multi-element moves\\*\\*. Think of it like a combination lock where three pins need to turn at exactly the same time — testing any single pin makes things worse.\n\n\n\nPairwise swaps can't find these. SA proposes single swaps. You need to systematically test coordinated 3-way moves to find them. Once we added 3-opt to the move vocabulary, it solved in seconds.\n\n\n\n\\## What Surprised Us\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Apple Silicon dominated.\\*\\* The M4 Max was 2.5x faster per-thread than our Threadripper on CPU-bound numpy. The final solve happened on the MacBook Pro.\n\n\\- \\*\\*Consensus analysis > more compute.\\*\\* Analyzing \\*where solutions disagree\\* was worth more than 10x the SA fleet time.\n\n\\- \\*\\*The puzzle has fractal structure.\\*\\* Coarse optimization (SA) solves 90% of positions. Medium optimization (swap cascades) solves the next 8%. The last 2% requires coordinated multi-block moves that no stochastic method will find in reasonable time.\n\n\\- \\*\\*47 seconds.\\*\\* The endgame solver found the solution in 47 seconds on the M4 Max. After 2 days of distributed SA across 5 machines. The right algorithm matters more than the right hardware.\n\n\n\n\\## Tech Stack\n\n\n\n\\- Python (torch, numpy, scipy)\n\n\\- PostgreSQL for distributed solution pool\n\n\\- No frameworks, no ML training, pure combinatorial optimization\n\n\\- Scripts: \\~4,500 lines across 15 solvers\n\n\n\n\\## Acknowledgment\n\n\n\nBuilt by the Cherokee AI Federation — a tribal AI sovereignty project. We're not a quant shop. We just like hard puzzles.\n\n",

      "text": "I've tasked Claude to scrape the dataset of Ycombinator companies currently hiring and try to find patterns, skills and tools that are most in demand for machine learning and AI jobs at these companies. \n\nThe dataset is clearly skewed towards the type of companies Ycombinator selects, which are currently very LLM/agent optimistic; on the other hand, these are very nimble and fast moving companies, and some of them could soon disrupt major players that are looking for other skills - so those more traditional roles and approaches might become harder to find in a few months or years. \n\nIn no way should this be seen as an attack against traditional ML approaches, data science and frontier model work; it's just a little data point for those with bills to pay and looking to dip their feet in this market. I found it interesting and share it here, maybe others will too. 100% LLM generated content follows after the line.\n\n\n_____________\n\n  Based on reading the 625 scraped jobs from WorkAtAStartup, here's my take:                                                                                                                                             \n  The Big Picture: Traditional ML Is Dead in Startup Land                                                                                                                                                                                    \n  The most striking finding is how completely LLM/agentic skills have displaced classical ML. Out of 37 jobs with AI in the title, only 2 are purely traditional ML (geospatial data science, physics simulation). Everything else assumes\n  you're building on top of foundation models, not training them from scratch.\n\n  The report's top skill — \"agents\" at 62% — is not a fluke. It reflects the dominant product pattern: companies are building vertical AI agents that do specific jobs (hospital operations, freight billing, sales outreach, insurance\n  processing). The role is less \"design a neural architecture\" and more \"orchestrate LLMs into reliable multi-step workflows.\"\n\nThe Skills That Actually Matter (In Priority Order)\n\nTier 1 — Non-negotiable:\n\n  - Python (59%) — universal baseline, no exceptions\n  - Agentic system design (62%) — tool calling, planning/execution loops, multi-agent orchestration. This is THE defining skill\n  - RAG pipelines — retrieval-augmented generation over domain-specific documents is in nearly every applied role\n  - LLM API fluency — knowing OpenAI, Anthropic/Claude, and how to prompt/fine-tune them effectively\n\nTier 2 — Strong differentiators:\n\n  - Evaluation frameworks — this is an emerging specialty. Companies like Sully.ai, goodfin, and Pylon explicitly call out \"LLM-as-judge,\" \"evaluation pipelines,\" and \"benchmarking\" as primary responsibilities. Knowing how to\n  systematically measure AI quality is becoming as important as building it\n  - AWS (51%) — cloud deployment is the default, AWS dominates\n  - TypeScript/React (39%) — AI engineers at startups are expected to be full-stack. You build the agent AND the UI\n  - Fine-tuning — more common than I expected. Companies like Persana AI and Conduit are going beyond prompting to actually fine-tune models for their domains\n\nTier 3 — Valuable but context-dependent:\n\n  - PyTorch (33%) — only matters if you're doing actual model training, not just API calls\n  - Docker/Kubernetes — infrastructure basics, expected but not the focus\n  - Vector databases / embeddings — important for RAG but becoming commoditized\n  - Go (21%) — surprisingly common, usually for backend/infra components alongside Python\n\nWhat the Market Does NOT Want\n\n  - Pure ML researchers — only ~3 roles in the entire dataset (Deepgram, Relace, AfterQuery). Startups aren't training foundation models\n  - CUDA/GPU optimization — 4 mentions out of 61 jobs. Leave this to NVIDIA and the hyperscalers\n  - Traditional data science (pandas, matplotlib, Jupyter notebooks) — the \"build dashboards and run A/B tests\" era is being replaced by \"build AI agents\"\n  - JAX, scikit-learn, classical ML frameworks — barely register\n\nThe Real Insight: \"AI Engineer\" Is a New Kind of Software Engineer\n\n  The most important takeaway isn't any single skill — it's that the \"AI Engineer\" role is fundamentally a software engineering role with AI as the primary tool. The best job descriptions (goodfin's Staff AI Engineer is the gold\n  standard) want someone who:\n\n  1. Understands LLM capabilities and limitations deeply\n  2. Can architect multi-step agentic systems that reason, not just generate\n  3. Builds evaluation infrastructure to know when things work\n  4. Ships production code with proper observability, error handling, and reliability\n  5. Thinks in product outcomes, not model metrics\n\n  goodfin's description nails it: \"The challenge is building systems that reason, compare tradeoffs, and surface uncertainty — not just generate fluent text.\"\n\nTwo Emerging Career Tracks Worth Watching\n\n  1. Forward Deployed AI Engineer — appeared at StackAI, HappyRobot, Phonely, Crustdata, and others. Part solutions engineer, part ML engineer. Deploys and adapts AI systems for enterprise customers. This didn't exist 2 years ago.\n  2. AI Evaluation Specialist — multiple companies now treat evals as a distinct discipline. Building automated evaluation pipelines, clinical-grade benchmarks, and LLM-as-judge systems is becoming its own specialization.\n\nBottom Line\n\n  If you're building an AI engineering skillset today, invest in: agentic system design, RAG, evaluation frameworks, and full-stack product building with Python + TypeScript. The market has clearly shifted from \"can you train a model?\"\n  to \"can you build a reliable AI product that does a real job?\"",

OP's analysis is based on one major assumption - that you want to work specifically for this kind of companies. There's plenty of jobs that do not require 75% of skills mentioned as \"non-negotiable\". \n\nOP's claim that traditional ML jobs will be harder to find in a **few months** is pretty funny too.

I would say the parts that is non-trivial is the part you should take as exercise to prove why it's true, as you've already noticed Goodfellow et al tends to make a lot of concise statement that are non-obvious (I remember one small paragraph in chapter 4 on optimization that lead to around 1-2page of proof, something about Hessians, second order directional derivatives, eigenvalues etc). I think it's a good book that goes the basic DL theory in a more mathematical way, especially the optimization parts (although very basic) and regularization, more than Prince and Bishop.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for more modern theory like generative modelling (diffusion and normalizing flows), llms, reinforcement learning, geometric deep learning, then a general book for that is Bishop or Prince. Prince is by far the easiest to go through, while Bishop is almost as hard as Goodfellow, a little easier though. If you want to go through each of these big topics in isolation there are specialized book for that, but if just want a general book that provides the basic then the aforementioned books are good.\n\nEdit: Also skip the backprop section of chap 6, I think Karpathy does a wonderful intuitive presentation of backprop and does it with code also! The backprop section in chap 6 is unecessarily convoluted for my taste. If you want some exercises on that you can also try to implement the minitorch part 1 assignment to see how autodiff is implemented with code (you create the framework to save the things you need in a computational graph and then use topological sort to rearrange the nodes to apply backprop...something like that). Also skip the RNN and CNN parts, I think there are better guides for that on the internet nowadays, youtube, cs231 for cnn or Colah blog for lstm + RNN.",

Algos like linear/polynomial/logistic regression, support vectors etc, linear algebra stuff, PCA/SVD and statistics stuff? \n\nIMHO, until unless you want to get into research field, why a person needs to know how a LLM is working under the hood in extreme detail to the level of QKV matrices, normalization etc?\n\nWhat if a person wants to  focus only on application layer above LLMs, can a person skip traditional ML learning path?\n\nAm I completely wrong here?",

Linear algebra is not “traditional ML.” It’s tied to transformer functions and overall. So unless I’m misunderstanding, you’re essentially saying - if I may offer an analogy, “why worry about what this part of a car does? I’m not making the car. “\n\nBut don’t you think you should understand how the car works, instead of simplifying it down to “I don’t know - it gets me from Point A to Point B.” Yes. But how?",

That path is real and valuable. But learning traditional ML, linear algebra, and especially statistics isn’t about memorizing old algorithms, it’s about building intuition. Stats helps you reason about uncertainty, bias, evaluation, and whether your system is actually working. Linear algebra helps you understand why embeddings, similarity, and dimensionality reduction behave the way they do. And classic ML teaches the discipline of modeling, debugging, and thinking in terms of data rather than just prompts.\n\nYou don’t need QKV-level depth unless you’re doing research, but having solid fundamentals makes your decisions sharper and your systems more reliable. It’s less about *how transformers multiply matrices* and more about *knowing when something is misleading, overfitting, or statistically weak*.\n\nSo yeah, you can skip parts of the traditional path if your goal is purely applied work. But the people who understand the fundamentals usually end up building more robust, trustworthy, and scalable AI systems in the long run.",

I'll write about a very specific point which was drilled into me voluntarily by my 8 year old self. It has nothing to do with professional paths. I completely agree with the professional reasons of why you should peek behind the curtains.\n\n  \nI naturally forgot what was the name of the book, and what was the name of the fictional character, but there was a book by the legendary Isaac Asimov, most probably from the Robot series. There was a particular story/chapter where a person with the job robopsychologist says that over centuries, the human race had abstracted away so much of the inner workings of the intelligent beings, that their decisions and actions, which are at the end of the day, theoretically deterministic and entirely in the control of humans, were no longer plausible and controllable to the point where there was a person who did the job of robopsychologist, of talking to these robots and trying to comprehend their actions. The need for such dire measures arose due to severe abstraction.\n\nNow this is science fiction, and touch wood, we shall not face such problems any time soon, or within my lifetime atleast. But then, during the COVID era, I never dreamt that in the next 5 years, there would be a tool I could converse with and study for my exams efficiently. Even if you're not going into the full depths by reading PRML/ESLII/Goodfellow/etc., a simple understanding of weights, activation functions, basic intuition of attention mechanisms, etc. would really improve a person's throughput as an engineer in this field.\n\n\\[Note: I'm not in the industry as a working professional, I'm merely a sophomore. My opinions are based on whatever projects I've built, some of which won hackathons and from my internship stint at my country's number one AI startup\\]",

Should you? That depends on your context. Using a technology without understanding it is not a new concept. I have a fridge at home, but I don't know how it works. If my job was to repair refrigerators, I would want to know a thing or two about those. If my job was to make new refrigerators, I would want to know a thing or two (but different things) about fridges.\n\nSame with ML. What you need to learn is not universal. Are you in a position to just call an API and move on with your life? Are you orchestrating a distributed training pipeline? Are you optimizing model serving? Are you trying to beat a SOTA benchmark with a new model? Are you trying to understand how the current models work?\n\nFinally, in spite of all the jaw dropping advances in AI, there are still humans out there who just want to learn purely for learning's sake, believe it or not.",

Well that’s just my opinion cuz OCR type stuff is YOLO101. \n\nBut kudos, good work. I’d also investigate why you’re getting 100% for 3.",

In 2026, it feels like almost everything new in AI and LLMs is being built on PyTorch anyway. It’s much more intuitive because it just feels like writing regular Python code, and debugging is so much easier compared to the headache of TensorFlow’s rigid structure.\n\nUnless your job specifically forces you to use TF, don't overcomplicate things; just learn PyTorch first. It’s what most people are actually using now, and the concepts are similar enough that you can always pick up TF later if you really have to.\n\nIf you're trying to understand the deeper trade-offs between the two frameworks especially from production perspective; this breakdown on [**PyTorch vs TensorFlow** ](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-enterprise-guide)does a solid job explaining when each one actually makes sense.\n\nIs anyone else finding that PyTorch is basically the default now, or are there still good reasons to start with TensorFlow?",

One would usually test for the gene in triplicate with t-test or the like, but given 30k genes are tested, multiple testing correction kills what little power there is. Buuuuut... if you consider the results of the experiment as a **rank** the change (t-stat) you can now use rank stats to compare between microarray experiments (GSA / GSEA). \n\n  \n",
