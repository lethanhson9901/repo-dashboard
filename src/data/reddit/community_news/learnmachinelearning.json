Come down to meet the school bus with the dogs, wiggling his fat little ass like he had a tail.\n\nMom didn't like it-he'd grab your pant cuff and play fight tug, ripped all our pants to shreds \n\nMorning the dogs knew all cattle were being group herded, ( loading , or moving pasture rotation )  late afternoon cutting,  prep to group herd in morning.\n\nLonger range cattle drive horses , dog assist.  Ten miles ( north quarter by river was ten miles away ) or 5 miles ( mid point pasture ).\n\nWe had  40 horses, 300 cattle, chickens  pigs ( chickens and pigs have to be widely separated , disease transmission ) , got rid of the sheep ( they chew the pasture down closer to the ground than cattle or horses, hard on the grass ). \n\nHad goats, but they were like teenagers at the mall, just go wherever the hell they want .\n\n5 dairy cows, two of the dogs thought they were bringing them in every day at five pm , but the dairy cows knew to come in, go right to their own milking stall.  The dogs were just really going for a one mile walk with them.\n\nIf you keep all the animals as tame as possible, they are a lot easier to control.   Same as being polite to people.\n\nMost of the horses were arabs, most neck reined out really well.  Only the stallion needed a bit, the rest hackamores or halter ride if feeling lazy.   \n\nIf some cows got out, heading to trample the wheat,  could jump on almost any horse bareback, and neck rein with just your palms.\n\nSend the dog ahead to turn them until you got on  a horse.\n\n3 out of five dogs were ok at cutting, ( need to spend a lot of time to get dogs as well trained as the video , we didn't, but they were ok at it   ) 2 dogs were just guard duty, coyotes, loose livestock alarm.\n\nThe badger slept in the barn with the dogs, he found a girlfriend and wandered away after 3 years.",

          "text": "Really enjoyed reading this, especially the way you framed maze solving as image segmentation rather than classical pathfinding. Generating 500k synthetic maze/solution pairs and pushing a U-Net to learn the mapping is a very clean experimental setup. The fact that it performs strongly up to 64x64 suggests it has genuinely internalised a lot of local path structure rather than just memorising patterns.\n\nI've approached maze solving from the opposite direction. Instead of learning the mapping, I model the maze explicitly as a graph:\n\nCells as vertices\nOpen passages as edges\nExplicit frontier / explored sets\n\nFrom there I use DFS, BFS, and A* with admissible heuristics (Manhattan for grids, cube distance for hex). So the solver is symbolic and deterministic. Optimality is guaranteed under the usual conditions (BFS for unweighted graphs, A* with admissible heuristic), and scaling behaviour is predictable: O(V+E).\n\nWhat's interesting is that your scaling limit around 127x127 makes perfect sense from a structural perspective.\n\nA CNN-based U-Net has:\n\nStrong local inductive bias (convolutions capture neighbourhood structure well)\nWeak global state representation\nNo explicit frontier expansion or path memory\n\nSo at small/medium sizes, it can approximate \"flow along corridors\" because that behaviour is locally consistent. But once the maze requires multi-stage global reasoning (long-range dependencies, dead-end propagation, or path decisions that depend on distant structure) the network has to simulate something like a search algorithm implicitly inside its activations. Convolutions are not naturally suited to that unless you add mechanisms for global context (attention, recurrence, or explicit graph structure).\n\nIn contrast, a graph search algorithm scales because it explicitly maintains state: frontier ordering, backtracking stack, accumulated cost, etc. It does not need to infer traversal logic; it executes it.\n\nThat said, I do not see your approach as competing with classical algorithms. It is answering a different question: can a neural network internalise algorithmic reasoning from data?\n\nIn that sense, the wall you're hitting is a very informative result rather than a failure. It is highlighting the boundary between local pattern recognition and structured multi-step reasoning.\n\nIf you wanted to push further, architectures that inject structural bias might help, e.g. graph neural networks, neural A* variants, attention layers that allow global communication, or iterative refinement steps that simulate expansion. A pure segmentation network is fighting its own inductive bias at larger scales.\n\nOverall, this is a thoughtful experiment and very cleanly executed. It's especially interesting that you used DFS to generate the ground truth, so in a way, the model is trying to approximate a classical algorithm without being given the algorithm itself.\n\nCurious to see how far you can push it with structural modifications.",

Doing it in JavaScript adds an extra layer of challenge because the ML ecosystem in JS is nowhere near as mature as Python so you cannot fall back on convenience functions when you get stuck. The fact that you implemented the forget gate, input gate, and output gate manually means you now understand LSTMs better than most people who use them daily through high-level APIs.

If you want to avoid the 'vibe-coded' platforms that just ask high-level theory, you should definitely check out TensorTonic.\n\nIt’s seriously impressive because it actually forces you to write tensor-level code (PyTorch/NumPy style) rather than just answering multiple-choice questions. It’s the closest thing I’ve found to a true 'LeetCode for ML' implementation.\nCheck it out here: https://www.tensortonic.com/\n\nOther solid alternatives:\n- Deep-ML: Great for fundamental matrix math.\n- MLStack: Better for system design and end-to-end pipelines.\n\nIf you’re prepping for interviews where you have to implement a layer or a loss function from scratch, TensorTonic is probably your best bet right now.",

[this educative course](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-machine-learning-interview) is basically the closest thing to a real leetcode for ml but focused on how you actually think and design in interviews. good luck!",

My general rule of thumb goes like this:\n\nIf your data fits in your RAM (like, under 10GB), just stick to Pandas. It’s the industry standard for a reason and handles the vast majority of normal tasks.\n\nIf you're dealing with a bit more; say 10GB to 100GB; give Polars a try. It’s way faster, handles memory much better, and you still don't have to mess around with setting up a cluster.\n\nYou really only need Apache Spark if you're actually dealing with terabytes of data or legitimately need to distribute your computing across multiple machines.\n\nThere's no need to optimize prematurely. You aren't \"less of an ML engineer\" just because you used Pandas for a 500MB dataset. You're just being efficient and saving everyone a headache.\n\nIf you're curious about when Spark actually makes sense in a real production environment, I put together a guide breaking down real-world use cases and performance trade-offs: [**Apache Spark**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/apache-spark)\n\nBut seriously, does anyone else feel like \"Big Data\" tools get pushed way too hard on beginners who just need to learn the basics first?",

If they do, cool, might play in their favor, though very minorly. I expect them to be able to reason about how to reason about their tools.

I wasn’t trained on this either.

In defense, if your system fails means people could die, and you always have someone trying to gain some form of information dominance over you. \n\nI do agree that this has been seen as important now since GenAI is so trivially easy to attack compared to having to find sensors traditional ML relied on. The fact that these frontier models are being constantly being push out of alignment makes them a huge risk in my mind, but again the incentive for making money somehow overweighs this risk.",

Then I filled in the gaps with adversarial ML research and practical red-team writeups. There are so many public CTF writeups on LLM security and I spend a few hours every week just reading through them to keep myself updated. Youtube has been a savior but it helped that I also took one focused online course on AI security, which honestly helped connect the dots in a more structured way. Now I just try to stay up to date by following new papers, incident reports, and public red-team findings as they come out. That's the current approach that has worked for me.",

Peer reviews will catch many of the other obvious problems, and the dedicated security architect's job will be to point folks in the right direction. I feel security is a shared responsibility. Just like backend engineers aren’t exempt from thinking about auth or input validation, ML engineers deploying models shouldn’t ignore adversarial risk entirely. Specialists help and that's true, but zero baseline awareness isn’t ideal either. We plan on doing more regular internal sessions for our folks to improve our baseline understanding. ",

But I was always left with this nagging feeling of *why* — why does it have this specific form? Where does it actually come from?\n\nSo I wrote the explanation I wish had existed when I was studying it. Rather than presenting the SVD as a given formula, the article builds it up from scratch by asking: what problem are we actually trying to solve? It turns out the answer to that question naturally leads you to the SVD formula, step by step, without any magic.\n\nThe key idea is that symmetric matrices have a superpower — they can always be diagonalized, and their eigenbasis is always orthogonal. The SVD is essentially the answer to the question: *what if we could have that for any matrix, not just symmetric ones?*\n\nIf you've ever felt that the standard textbook presentation left something to be desired, I hope this fills that gap. Feedback very welcome — especially if something is unclear or could be explained better.\n\nLink: [https://markelic.de/deriving-the-singular-value-decomposition-svd-from-first-principles/](https://markelic.de/deriving-the-singular-value-decomposition-svd-from-first-principles/)",

      "text": "I work as a Data Scientist in a big semiconductor company and thinking to switch my career and pursue Big Tech. Recently I finally got an opportunity to have my first ML interview in a well-known company and just wanted to post my experience. Overall, I was quite shocked of the questions and how much I still need to learn. I am pretty good at math and fundamental understanding of ML, which are the most needed skills in semiconductor industry. But the interview was no much about the technical things, but rather understanding of a product. It was a case study interview and surely, I was preparing, reading through examples of the case studies. But since I am not from this industry every new example for me requires some learning effort. Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to look into the recommender systems and this was exactly what I faced in the interview. Overall, I think it went not so good, the hardest part was not ML itself but discussing particular difficulties and edge cases of the product. Here is some overview containing maybe around 70% since I couldn't memorize all of it. Hopefully, it would helpful for you, guys.\n\n**Q: Let's say we want to start a business to recommend restaurants. How do we make a recommendation list for a user without prior data?**\n\nThis is not a difficult question, but I was a bit nervous and said the first thing that came to my mind: we can fetch Google reviews and sort the list. The interviewer obviously was not satisfied and said that I would have millions of good restaurants. I immediately said that we need to sort by location as well. At that moment, my brain kind of thought that the location is already accounted by default so I don't need to even think about it. Weird. I know\n\n**Q: Ok, suppose you have been running your business for some time. How do we modify recommendation**s?\n\nI said that we would need to assemble some data and engineer features. Then we discussed features, I listed some of the client behavior, restaurant attributes. After thinking further mentioned delivery features and external conditions like weather or special events.\n\n**Q: What are the models we can start building?**\n\nI wanted to start simple and proposed to calculate cosine similarities or kNN to recommend restaurants closest to the ones user liked.\n\n**Q: Do you think we lack something?**\n\nI was stumbled a bit since the question is a bit generic. The interviewer hinted: \"How do we know a user liked a restaurant?\". I said that we can do it by reviews. The interviewer said not many people leave reviews. I said we can track user behavior, e.g. if a user ordered more then once from a restaurant or we can monitor click through rate or something like this. The interviewer didn't seem satisfied and explained how he would do it but my brain kind of switched off for a moment and I didn't get the idea.\n\n**Q: What are other more advanced modeling options?**\n\nI proposed a supervised classification approach. We talked a bit on what would be the data: features for different users/restaurant, labels if a user likes a restaurant, possible randomization of samples, like various locations.\n\n**Q: What is the concrete model?**\n\nI said I would start simple with logistic regression.\n\n**Q: What is the cost function for it?**\n\nI said it is binary cross-entropy.\n\n**Q: What else should be in the cost function? Can we have some problems in the data?**\n\nI couldn't immediately come up with problems in the data that should modify the cost function and my brain tried to give me some time for processing this in the background while saying: \"We definitely should add regularization\". I guess this was not an answer the interviewer expected but he agreed it is needed. He briefly asked why do we need regularization, overfitting problems, difference between L1/L2. But then he came back to his original query.\n\n**Q: Due to the nature of recommender systems there be more problems with your samples.**\n\nLuckily, the background processing in my brain came up with imbalanced classes so mentioned it. This was correct.\n\n**Q: So what can we do about it?**\n\nI mumbled that we can do undersampling to balance the classes and also accuracy is a bad metric and we need to track precision and recall and so on, but reviewer asked can we do something about the cost function first? As you can see he really couldn't let it go. Finally, I got his very first question where this discussion started and replied that we can downweight the samples from a majority class. He said that this is what he wanted to hear.\n\n**Q: So what about correct metrics for imbalanced data?**\n\nI explained about precision and recall and said that I would monitor ROC AUC and Precision&Recall AUC modifying the classification threshold. The interviewer clarified which of the metrics is better for imbalanced data? I actually don't deal much with classification problems in my work so didn't have a sharp answer but started thinking out loud that ROC reflects FPR but doesn't directly account for FNR and then the interviewer kind of finished my thinking process saying that indeed PR AUC is better. I think if I had more time I could have reached this conclusion as well, but perhaps this is what true experts should know without thinking about it.\n\n**Q: What are other industry standard you know for the classification?**\n\nI discussed Gradient Boosted Trees and Random Forest, also mentioned Deep Learning, elaborated a bit of interpretability and memory/computation requirements.\n\n**Q: What are the problems we may have for a new registered restaurant?**\n\nI said that it may have a feature we didn't account for before. However, I couldn't really come up with an idea how to deal with it. The interviewer said that the new restaurant should appear at the top of the list so that users have higher chance to order from it.\n\n**Q: And what should be the users to whom we can propose this new restaurant?**\n\nThe ones who has higher probability to like it based on the previous behaviour\n\n**Q: Let's say a user sees top-5 restaurants and choose one. What about the others he doesn't see. Should we mark them as negative?**\n\nI said that obviously not since it will create noise, but I didn't have a clue how to handle that properly. The interviewer explained something but my brain was frozen again and I don't recall what was a correct reply. I only remember that at some point I said \"we can randomize this top-5 list\".\n\n**Q: Let's say you trained the model is it ready to roll out?**\n\nI mentioned cross-validation etc, but that was not what the interviewer wanted. He said we need to do pilot study. I do know what is A/B testing but my confusion was that I kind of thought this pilot study is by default integrated in the roll-off process for some random users. But from the interviewer perspective I guess it simply looked like I didn't even think about it",

If you are serious about switching, I would focus on depth over breadth. Pick a subarea and go beyond implementing standard models. Reproduce a recent paper, document the gaps, try small extensions. That signals research thinking more than another CNN project.\n\nYou could also look at research engineer roles or industry labs where strong engineering plus ML fundamentals are valued. Some people transition that way and then move closer to pure research later. The bigger question is what kind of research you are aiming for. Theory, applied ML, domain specific like scientific computing? Your chemical engineering background could actually be a differentiator if you lean into it instead of trying to look like every other applicant.",

One thing that helped me was treating my AI work less like a passion escape and more like a structured program with milestones and timelines. It made the side project feel intentional instead of something squeezed in after burnout hours. If you can carve out a repeatable rhythm, even a few focused hours a week, it starts compounding. Over time you build not just projects, but evidence of discipline and direction. What kind of AI work are you hoping to focus on long term? ",

If you quit now with $0 revenue, stress replaces passion fast. The smarter move is to treat your job as runway funding. Give yourself a hard metric: don’t quit until you hit consistent $2k–$3k MRR or 3–6 months of living expenses saved. Most solo AI builders need 6–12 months before meaningful income. The people who make it usually ship weekly, talk to users weekly, and validate demand before building “cool” stuff. Passion scales when it’s attached to revenue. Until then, your job is just your investor.",
