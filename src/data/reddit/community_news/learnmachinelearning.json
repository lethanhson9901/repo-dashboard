Come down to meet the school bus with the dogs, wiggling his fat little ass like he had a tail.\n\nMom didn't like it-he'd grab your pant cuff and play fight tug, ripped all our pants to shreds \n\nMorning the dogs knew all cattle were being group herded, ( loading , or moving pasture rotation )  late afternoon cutting,  prep to group herd in morning.\n\nLonger range cattle drive horses , dog assist.  Ten miles ( north quarter by river was ten miles away ) or 5 miles ( mid point pasture ).\n\nWe had  40 horses, 300 cattle, chickens  pigs ( chickens and pigs have to be widely separated , disease transmission ) , got rid of the sheep ( they chew the pasture down closer to the ground than cattle or horses, hard on the grass ). \n\nHad goats, but they were like teenagers at the mall, just go wherever the hell they want .\n\n5 dairy cows, two of the dogs thought they were bringing them in every day at five pm , but the dairy cows knew to come in, go right to their own milking stall.  The dogs were just really going for a one mile walk with them.\n\nIf you keep all the animals as tame as possible, they are a lot easier to control.   Same as being polite to people.\n\nMost of the horses were arabs, most neck reined out really well.  Only the stallion needed a bit, the rest hackamores or halter ride if feeling lazy.   \n\nIf some cows got out, heading to trample the wheat,  could jump on almost any horse bareback, and neck rein with just your palms.\n\nSend the dog ahead to turn them until you got on  a horse.\n\n3 out of five dogs were ok at cutting, ( need to spend a lot of time to get dogs as well trained as the video , we didn't, but they were ok at it   ) 2 dogs were just guard duty, coyotes, loose livestock alarm.\n\nThe badger slept in the barn with the dogs, he found a girlfriend and wandered away after 3 years.",

          "text": "Really enjoyed reading this, especially the way you framed maze solving as image segmentation rather than classical pathfinding. Generating 500k synthetic maze/solution pairs and pushing a U-Net to learn the mapping is a very clean experimental setup. The fact that it performs strongly up to 64x64 suggests it has genuinely internalised a lot of local path structure rather than just memorising patterns.\n\nI've approached maze solving from the opposite direction. Instead of learning the mapping, I model the maze explicitly as a graph:\n\nCells as vertices\nOpen passages as edges\nExplicit frontier / explored sets\n\nFrom there I use DFS, BFS, and A* with admissible heuristics (Manhattan for grids, cube distance for hex). So the solver is symbolic and deterministic. Optimality is guaranteed under the usual conditions (BFS for unweighted graphs, A* with admissible heuristic), and scaling behaviour is predictable: O(V+E).\n\nWhat's interesting is that your scaling limit around 127x127 makes perfect sense from a structural perspective.\n\nA CNN-based U-Net has:\n\nStrong local inductive bias (convolutions capture neighbourhood structure well)\nWeak global state representation\nNo explicit frontier expansion or path memory\n\nSo at small/medium sizes, it can approximate \"flow along corridors\" because that behaviour is locally consistent. But once the maze requires multi-stage global reasoning (long-range dependencies, dead-end propagation, or path decisions that depend on distant structure) the network has to simulate something like a search algorithm implicitly inside its activations. Convolutions are not naturally suited to that unless you add mechanisms for global context (attention, recurrence, or explicit graph structure).\n\nIn contrast, a graph search algorithm scales because it explicitly maintains state: frontier ordering, backtracking stack, accumulated cost, etc. It does not need to infer traversal logic; it executes it.\n\nThat said, I do not see your approach as competing with classical algorithms. It is answering a different question: can a neural network internalise algorithmic reasoning from data?\n\nIn that sense, the wall you're hitting is a very informative result rather than a failure. It is highlighting the boundary between local pattern recognition and structured multi-step reasoning.\n\nIf you wanted to push further, architectures that inject structural bias might help, e.g. graph neural networks, neural A* variants, attention layers that allow global communication, or iterative refinement steps that simulate expansion. A pure segmentation network is fighting its own inductive bias at larger scales.\n\nOverall, this is a thoughtful experiment and very cleanly executed. It's especially interesting that you used DFS to generate the ground truth, so in a way, the model is trying to approximate a classical algorithm without being given the algorithm itself.\n\nCurious to see how far you can push it with structural modifications.",

Doing it in JavaScript adds an extra layer of challenge because the ML ecosystem in JS is nowhere near as mature as Python so you cannot fall back on convenience functions when you get stuck. The fact that you implemented the forget gate, input gate, and output gate manually means you now understand LSTMs better than most people who use them daily through high-level APIs.

If you want to avoid the 'vibe-coded' platforms that just ask high-level theory, you should definitely check out TensorTonic.\n\nIt’s seriously impressive because it actually forces you to write tensor-level code (PyTorch/NumPy style) rather than just answering multiple-choice questions. It’s the closest thing I’ve found to a true 'LeetCode for ML' implementation.\nCheck it out here: https://www.tensortonic.com/\n\nOther solid alternatives:\n- Deep-ML: Great for fundamental matrix math.\n- MLStack: Better for system design and end-to-end pipelines.\n\nIf you’re prepping for interviews where you have to implement a layer or a loss function from scratch, TensorTonic is probably your best bet right now.",

[this educative course](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-machine-learning-interview) is basically the closest thing to a real leetcode for ml but focused on how you actually think and design in interviews. good luck!",

My general rule of thumb goes like this:\n\nIf your data fits in your RAM (like, under 10GB), just stick to Pandas. It’s the industry standard for a reason and handles the vast majority of normal tasks.\n\nIf you're dealing with a bit more; say 10GB to 100GB; give Polars a try. It’s way faster, handles memory much better, and you still don't have to mess around with setting up a cluster.\n\nYou really only need Apache Spark if you're actually dealing with terabytes of data or legitimately need to distribute your computing across multiple machines.\n\nThere's no need to optimize prematurely. You aren't \"less of an ML engineer\" just because you used Pandas for a 500MB dataset. You're just being efficient and saving everyone a headache.\n\nIf you're curious about when Spark actually makes sense in a real production environment, I put together a guide breaking down real-world use cases and performance trade-offs: [**Apache Spark**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/apache-spark)\n\nBut seriously, does anyone else feel like \"Big Data\" tools get pushed way too hard on beginners who just need to learn the basics first?",

When would it make sense to reach for a structured vs unstructured database? When would it make sense to reach for redis over postgres? etc\n\nAnd when I'm writing a rec for an open position, I rarely expect candidates to have working knowledge of specific tools. If they do, cool, might play in their favor, though very minorly. I expect them to be able to reason about how to reason about their tools. I can teach them to use services; it's significantly harder to teach them how to reason.",

      "text": "Over the past four months, I’ve been interviewing for Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) and Applied Scientist (AS) roles. While preparing, I realized that high-quality, relevant resources are actually quite limited, so I wanted to share my own experience here. I’ll probably break this down into 2 or 3 posts. This is Part 1.\n\n>\n\nFor context, out of Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, TikTok, Pinterest, Airbnb, and Netflix—excluding the company I currently/previously worked for (\\~5 YOE in ML)—I interviewed at the rest. I received offers from all but one. The exact titles vary slightly depending on the company (MLE / Applied Scientist / Data Scientist - Modeling Track), but for the sake of this post, I will just refer to all of them as MLE.\n\nWhen preparing for MLE interviews, you generally need to focus on a few key areas:\n\n# 1. Coding\n\nPreparing for this is not fundamentally different from standard Software Development Engineer (SDE) coding prep. You need to grind LeetCode. Some companies will require your code to compile, and you'll either need to write your own test cases or pass pre-written ones.\n\nStandard best practices apply here (which you can find in any SWE interview guide):\n\n* **Ask clarification questions:** Are there memory constraints? What is the input range/format?\n* **Communicate:** Discuss your high-level approach and data structures with the interviewer *before* writing a single line of code.\n* **Structure:** Have a clear mental outline of what each block of your code is doing.\n* **Iterate:** If you can't think of the most optimal approach immediately, start with a brute-force working solution and then optimize it.\n\n**The MLE Twist:** What makes coding slightly different for MLEs is that some companies have dedicated \"ML Coding\" rounds or ask more mathematically inclined questions. For example, you might be asked to design a sparse matrix (including addition, subtraction, multiplication). This requires you to actually understand how matrix operations work under the hood.\n\nSome companies might even ask you to implement a specific algorithm from scratch (like kNN or k-means) or use a Deep Learning framework to implement a basic model, like Transformer matrix operations (though this is less common). **My advice:** For the most common interview questions, I was able to find them on [PracHub](https://prachub.com/)\n\n\n\n# 2. ML System Design\n\nThis is the biggest differentiator between SDE and MLE interviews. Almost every company will have one or two rounds dedicated to this.\n\nGenerally, you will be asked to design a solution for a real-world use case. Common examples include: *How would you design the YouTube recommendation system?* or *Design the DoorDash search box / auto-suggestion feature.* Because these questions have high ambiguity and rely heavily on practical experience, they are very difficult to bluff your way through.\n\nHere is how I suggest preparing:\n\n# A. Daily Accumulation (Hands-on Experience)\n\nIf you have hands-on experience building end-to-end ML projects (defining the problem, finding features, modeling, offline evaluation, online deployment, monitoring, iteration, etc.), you are already halfway there. Regardless of the specific ML domain you are asked about, the overarching architectural framework is largely the same; you are just plugging in different components.\n\nIf you lack ML product experience, you should at least have offline model-building experience, and then supplement that by reading engineering blogs from tech companies (like Pinterest or Airbnb) to build your product sense.\n\nThis \"accumulation\" really shows during follow-up questions. For instance, in an NLP app, they might ask how you'd handle extremely long text inputs. For a recommendation app, they might ask how you'd conduct counterfactual evaluation. You build a sense for these answers by following the state-of-the-art (SOTA), reading papers, attending conferences, and listening to talks. This is hard to cram for.\n\n# B. Prep Materials\n\n* **Courses:** If you have very little practical experience, look into *ML System Design* on Educative or *Grokking the Machine Learning Interview*. This will at least give you a baseline framework (e.g., knowing that \"Search\" is split into Information Retrieval and Ranking). If you already have solid CV/NLP/Search/RecSys experience, these courses might be too basic for you.\n* **Engineering Blogs:** Read company blogs to understand the exact types of problems they face and how they solve them.\n* **YouTube:** Good videos are rare, but they exist. For example, \\[this talk\\] is pretty solid.\n\n# C. Read Papers\n\nFor someone who already has a habit of reading research papers, there is no faster way to prepare. A good applied research paper tells a complete story: Problem -> Features -> Methodology -> Evaluation -> Online Results. **This is exactly the flow of an ML Design interview.** The list of \"must-read\" classic papers is actually quite short:\n\n* **Recommendation/Search (Most common):** *Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations*. If you only have time to read one paper, eat, sleep, and breathe this one.\n* **Auto-completion:** *Gmail Smart Compose: Real-Time Assisted Writing*.\n* **Option Generation:** *Smart Reply: Automated Response Suggestion for Email*.\n* **Ranking/Personalization:** Airbnb has several excellent papers on this.\n\n# D. My Preferred Framework for Answering\n\nWhen tackling an ML Design question, I like to follow this structure:\n\n1. **Ask Clarification Questions:** \\* *What is the stage of the project?* (If it's early stage, you must address the cold-start problem).\n   * *What is the traffic volume?* (This impacts your engineering robustness and latency considerations).\n   * *Can I assume standard data is logged?* (Usually yes, but always double-confirm).\n2. **Draw the High-Level Architecture:** Set up the standard \"cookie-cutter\" structure. Briefly describe the main components:\n   * **Online:** Data (online user data + database fetches), ML Service, ML Model Artifact, Logging, and Monitoring.\n   * **Offline:** Feature processing, Modeling, Evaluation.\n   * *Tip:* I highly recommend drawing this out for the interviewer. Since most of my interviews were remote, I had an iPad ready to draw the architecture live. It shows you are highly organized, and when you dive into the details, the interviewer knows exactly which component you are talking about.\n3. **Deep Dive into Implementation:**\n   * **Features:** Brainstorm what data you need. For recommendations, this is usually split into: *Document features* (views, text/video embeddings), *User features* (gender, geo-location **\\[super important for local search\\]**, watch/search history), and *Interaction features* (distance, previously clicked/watched, matched text). You must know how to handle non-numerical data using text/image/ID embeddings.\n   * **Modeling (The Meat):** Frame the problem first (Is this regression? Classification? Ranking?). How do you encode the inputs? What is the model architecture (e.g., for ranking: bi-encoder vs cross-encoder vs poly-encoder; for RecSys: two-tower)? Compare the pros and cons of different models (LR vs Random Forest; LSTM vs Transformer). Finally, how do you choose your loss function?\n   * **Evaluation:** Know the standard offline metrics (Accuracy, AUC, F1, Precision/Recall, MSE) and NLP-specific metrics (Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore).\n   * **The Rest:** You usually won't spend too much time here, but touch on how different data is stored and how the data pipeline is designed.\n\nThe rest of the interview depends entirely on what specific areas the interviewer wants to drill into—and that relies on your deep knowledge. For example, how do you handle a search for restaurant chains? How do you handle exploratory search (e.g., \"movies for family\")? What if you have very little data? This is where you can start discussing Knowledge Graphs, Active Learning, Reinforcement Learning, GANs, etc.",

I wasn’t trained on this either. It just feels like the education pipeline is lagging hard.\n\nSome of our senior staff has suggested we hire based on development experience and then we could do inhouse training on secure AI development and testing, but I'm not sure if thats the best approach to go with. \n\nFor folks here - did anyone learn AI security formally?

I get in business someone poisoning a model is relatively little risk, but that’s more of an incentive problem than model risk doesn’t exist. In defense, if your system fails means people could die, and you always have someone trying to gain some form of information dominance over you. \n\nI do agree that this has been seen as important now since GenAI is so trivially easy to attack compared to having to find sensors traditional ML relied on. The fact that these frontier models are being constantly being push out of alignment makes them a huge risk in my mind, but again the incentive for making money somehow overweighs this risk.",

We don't want to defer it until something goes wrong. I think you’re right that in certain domains this has always mattered. Maybe outside of those domains, it just hasn’t been treated as a first-class concern yet. Hopefully things start moving in the smoother direction. Its about time right?",

When I moved into LLM work, I just applied the same thinking. I personally like the concept of thinking in terms of system. Then I filled in the gaps with adversarial ML research and practical red-team writeups. There are so many public CTF writeups on LLM security and I spend a few hours every week just reading through them to keep myself updated. Youtube has been a savior but it helped that I also took one focused online course on AI security, which honestly helped connect the dots in a more structured way. Now I just try to stay up to date by following new papers, incident reports, and public red-team findings as they come out. That's the current approach that has worked for me.",

Just like backend engineers aren’t exempt from thinking about auth or input validation, ML engineers deploying models shouldn’t ignore adversarial risk entirely. Specialists help and that's true, but zero baseline awareness isn’t ideal either. We plan on doing more regular internal sessions for our folks to improve our baseline understanding. ",

      "text": "Every explanation of the Singular Value Decomposition I came across as a student followed the same pattern: here is the formula, here is a proof that it works. Done. But I was always left with this nagging feeling of *why* — why does it have this specific form? Where does it actually come from?\n\nSo I wrote the explanation I wish had existed when I was studying it. Rather than presenting the SVD as a given formula, the article builds it up from scratch by asking: what problem are we actually trying to solve? It turns out the answer to that question naturally leads you to the SVD formula, step by step, without any magic.\n\nThe key idea is that symmetric matrices have a superpower — they can always be diagonalized, and their eigenbasis is always orthogonal. The SVD is essentially the answer to the question: *what if we could have that for any matrix, not just symmetric ones?*\n\nIf you've ever felt that the standard textbook presentation left something to be desired, I hope this fills that gap. Feedback very welcome — especially if something is unclear or could be explained better.\n\nLink: [https://markelic.de/deriving-the-singular-value-decomposition-svd-from-first-principles/](https://markelic.de/deriving-the-singular-value-decomposition-svd-from-first-principles/)",

If you are like me, your first few ideas will work really well but will have already been done. Eventually you’ll create something truly novel. That will help you land an internship. If it doesn’t, keep whacking away, ensure your projects are killer quality. Once you’ve landed the internship your utility (from the amount/rareness of skills to hours logged to insights generated and tested) will determine your staying power. I want to negotiate from a stronger position and contribute massively to the field, so I’m focusing on home run style experiments and potentially a foundational startup",

If you are serious about switching, I would focus on depth over breadth. Pick a subarea and go beyond implementing standard models. Reproduce a recent paper, document the gaps, try small extensions. That signals research thinking more than another CNN project.\n\nYou could also look at research engineer roles or industry labs where strong engineering plus ML fundamentals are valued. Some people transition that way and then move closer to pure research later. The bigger question is what kind of research you are aiming for. Theory, applied ML, domain specific like scientific computing? Your chemical engineering background could actually be a differentiator if you lean into it instead of trying to look like every other applicant.",

          "text": "Getting into AI/ML can feel overwhelming at first, but it’s honestly more structured than it looks. Start with the foundations basic Python, some linear algebra, probability, and statistics. \nYou don’t need to be a math genius, but you should understand concepts like gradients, distributions, and how models minimize error. After that, move into core machine learning: learn how linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks actually work. Don’t just run the code, try to understand what the model is optimizing and why.\n\nFor learning resources, I’d recommend something practical and beginner-friendly like the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, and for intuitive explanations, the StatQuest YouTube channel is gold. Structured training programs also have solid ML courses if you prefer guided learning. Many companies provide such training with practical learning and internship. Once you’re comfortable, start building small projects, recommendation systems, simple chatbots, prediction models and deploy them. Real projects matter much more than just certificates.\n\nAs for the job market: yes, AI/ML specialists are definitely needed, but the market is competitive. Companies are looking for people who can apply AI to solve real problems, not just train models in notebooks. If you can combine ML skills with another domain (web apps, cybersecurity, healthcare, automation, etc.), you become much more valuable. It’s a long-term game, but if you’re genuinely interested and consistent, there’s absolutely space in the industry for you.",
