There are some things that give a 'rough around the edges\" feel. \n\nWhen you enter a problem, there is a left and right panel. Right has the code, and left has some interactive widgets mixed into markdown (mdx?). The markdown is not very well styled. The sizes of the fonts in the widgets and even in equations is noticeably larger than in the rendered markdown text. I would suggest making the font size larger for the explanatory text (markdown text). Indentation is lacking. \n\nJust off the bat, here is some things I would do:\n\n- Increase font size a tiny bit for the content (not the widget)\n\n- Change the `p-4` in `p-4 overflow-auto text-sm leading-6 text-zinc-200 flex-1` to `p-8`. Or better yet, set `max-w` on the content to be better suited to the font size. <- The latter would be better for wide and less wide screens (than changing padding).  \n\n- Change the padding of the panel header (tabs) to match: `px-4` -> `px-8` or set max-w to be the same as the header \n\n- Make the `:r1u:` data panel have scrollbars that are styled the same as the scrollbar for the code editor in the right panel.  \n\n- Increase margins for markdown block elements (lists, quote, etc).  \n\n- Increase left & right padding for code blocks (`<pre>` elements)\n\nWidgets look great!\n\nAs far as content goes, my only suggestion is to start users off in a intro/starting page when they go to the ML Research and ML Math page. It could give you the opportunity to give some general background, at timeline of these papers, a suggested/recommended path for the users to follow, etc.\n\nLastly, I dont know if its just on my end, but I am getting a bunch of errors in the console. App still seems to work though!\n\nThis is an amazing effort! And a killer resource.",

I don’t care if you realized you made a mistake beforehand or not. I have no reason to care about it. I offered you very generic advice on how to convince people your model generalizes on unseen data. That’s as far as it goes. You can interpret what you have in whatever way you want. You won’t convince anybody it works if you aren’t willing to do it. You also don’t have to do it, we don’t care. But you’re coming across as disingenuous because you asked for feedback and then rejected all of it. You’re not going to get very far in a career in data science if you can’t take criticism.

Some other applications are less exciting because they have the potential to be misused. Tbf anything has the potential to be misused, but some more than others. Deep fakes is one of those things. This is not to say that the technology behind it (the maths and the engineering) is not exciting. It is! But the actual implementation of those cool ideas is potentially harmful, so when learning it's important to keep that in mind",

Learn the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning and get comfortable with the idea of features, labels, training, and testing. At the same time, refresh Python basics you’ll use all the time in ML, especially NumPy and pandas. Try loading a dataset, cleaning it, and doing some simple exploration.\n\nIn week two, start with your first real models. Learn linear regression and logistic regression and implement them using scikit-learn. Don’t worry about the math being perfect, just understand what the model is trying to do and how to evaluate it. Work with a small dataset and focus on things like train/test split, accuracy, and mean squared error.\n\nWeek three, classic machine learning algorithms. Learn decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests. This is where ideas like overfitting and bias vs variance start to make sense. Try changing model parameters and see how performance changes. This experimentation is more important than memorizing formulas.\n\nIn the fourth week, put everything together in a small project. Take a dataset from Kaggle and go end to end: clean the data, choose a model, train it, evaluate it, and explain your results in plain language. Even a simple project here will boost your confidence a lot.\n\nBy the end of the month, you won’t be an expert, but you’ll actually understand how machine learning works and how to build models. From there, you can decide whether to go deeper into math, try deep learning, or focus on more projects.",

I end up jumping between resources to fill gaps and lose a clear sense of progression.\n\n**Background:** Bachelor’s degree; some linear algebra & calculus (needs review); basic/intermediate Python.\n\n**Goal:**\n\nAt minimum, stay on a correct learning path and accumulate skills steadily.\n\nLong-term, build a strong foundation and the ability to implement/diagnose models independently.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. When does it make sense to read papers, and how do you avoid getting lost in prerequisites?\n2. What “must-have” fundamentals should come before reading modern deep learning papers?\n3. Top-down (papers → fill gaps) vs bottom-up (fundamentals → models → papers): which works better, and what milestone sequence would you recommend?\n4. What practice routine forces real understanding (e.g., implementations, reproductions, projects)?\n\nNot looking for a huge link dump—just a practical roadmap and milestones.\n\nThanks!",

          "text": "Bottom-up always or you will be lost in the sauce. Here is what I’d suggest.\n\nYou need to start in the metaphorical basement: linear algebra (at least understanding the topics covered by a typical college course, and maybe some extras - critical concepts include vector spaces and their properties, matrix manipulation / multiplication and matrix properties, linear transformations and their properties), calculus (limits, differentiation, integration, multi-variable calculus should be sufficient for basics), and maybe most importantly probability + statistics (understanding probability spaces, I.e., how do we define them, random variables, random vectors, functions of random variables, stochastic processes, etc.) I would also strongly recommend studying statistical estimation and detection - the theory underpins fundamental problems tackled by ML. Also, understanding some optimization theory would be useful (e.g., convex optimization, KKT, etc.).\n\nThen you can move onto an ML intro course’s content: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, basic optimization if not already learned (GD and SGD), multi-layer perceptrons (simple NNs), etc. There are of course more “intro” concepts, but I think these would give you a strong foundation.\n\nFrom here, you should dive into more advanced topics that interest you. I would advise avoiding papers until you have a very high mathematical maturity level and truly understand fundamental concepts. Most papers (or their key concepts) can be found described in blog posts that are easier to digest.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I would strongly suggest pursuing an MS or a PhD if you are serious about getting into ML. Self-learning ML is much more difficult than just learning to code. Coding is a part of the job of course, but it is the easiest part (at least for researchers).",

This should go over linear regression, logistic regression, SVMs, RBF-networks, and maybe up to basic neural networks (but nothing fancier). The important thing is building an understanding behind regularization, data snooping, and other fundamental concepts\n\n3. More optional, but a course on ML focused on optimization math to gain better understanding of convergence guarantees, various forms of regularization, and looking at the same problem from multiple perspectives\n\n4. THEN beginning to look at more advanced architecture and building other projects\n\nA lot of people are saying \"just learn on the fly and build projects\" but I think its best to have some theory to start with :)",

Once you have discovered a problem you can ask whatever LLM you prefer a structured a roadmap of what you should know to tackle the problem using ML from basics. From there you learn + build simultaneously whether its by reading up on an algorithm or seeing how others have implemented it in code etc. \n\nFor example, if you have to use linear regression at some point just knowing what is it about the fundamental nature of linear regression that helps solve this problem can help you master certain commonly used ML algorithms\n\nAlthough i would say before u build something serious u should have a good grasp on the mathematics especially linear algebra. im currently studying it from this book https://mml-book.github.io which has been recommended a lot in this subreddit.

The hard part, and useful part, and undertaught part, is autograd: generalizing the framework so you can use different losses, different activations, and different architecture. This also teaches people how to really understand backprop, since you have to operate on generalized incoming gradients and activation values.\n\nIf you're building a course, it may be neat to help people build an autograd for the simple functions (add, subtract, matmul, etc.) to implement a neural network from scratch.",

Wanted to share a lesson I learned the hard way about embedding-based matching  might save someone else the same mistake.\n\n**The approach**: Embed user profiles via LLM into 1536-dim vectors, store in Pinecone, query with ANN + metadata filters. Sub-200ms, scales well, semantically smart — \"loves hiking\" matches \"outdoor enthusiast\" automatically.\n\n**What went wrong**: 22% mutual acceptance rate. I audited the rejected high-scoring matches and found this:\n\n    User A: \"Career-focused lawyer, wants kids in 2 years, monogamy essential\"\n    User B: \"Career-focused consultant, never wants kids, open relationship\"\n    \n    Cosine similarity: 0.91\n    Reality: incompatible on two dealbreakers\n    \n\nEmbeddings captured *how someone describes their life*, tone, topic, semantic texture. They completely missed *what someone actually needs*, the structured preferences buried in the prose.\n\nThis wasn't an edge case. It was the dominant failure mode. High similarity, fundamental incompatibility. Two people who sounded alike but wanted completely different things.\n\n**The lesson**: Embedding similarity is necessary but not sufficient for compatibility. If your domain has dealbreakers, hard constraints where incompatibility on a single dimension overrides overall similarity, you need structured signal extraction on top.\n\n**What I did instead** (brief summary):\n\n1. Extracted 26 structured features from natural AI conversations (not surveys, 30% survey completion vs 85% conversational extraction)\n2. Built distance matrices: nuanced compatibility scores (0.0-1.0) instead of binary match/no-match\n3. Added hard filters: 4 dealbreaker features that reject pairs before scoring, zero exceptions\n4. Combined signals: `0.25 × text + 0.15 × visual + 0.60 × features`\n\n22% to 35% with this. Two more stages (personalized weights + bidirectional matching) took it to 68%.\n\nThis generalizes beyond dating; job matching (remote vs on-site is a dealbreaker regardless of skill similarity), marketplace matching (budget overrides preference), probably others.\n\nHas anyone else hit this wall with embeddings? Curious how others handle the structured-vs-semantic tradeoff.\n\nEdit:\nI know how training a biencoder on pairwise data would help, but mining hard negatives in such cases becomes a key challenge and also loses bidirectional non equivalence of liking one another ",

I think training a deep NN of person 1 features against peron 2 features labeled with match or not to output compatibility score is a good aproach. That way you dont need hard rules of fundamental incompatibility that are perhaps not fully statistically viable. I think there is a danger of modeling the probability of a match as independent probabilities from both sides, it is a strong assumption to make.",
