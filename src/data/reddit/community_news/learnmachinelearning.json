These embeddings are fixed and learned specifically for the training context length. \n\nSo, if the model sees a sequence longer than it was trained on, for example,  block size 32 trained, but trying to infer on 33, the position embeddings fail, and the model performance collapses.\n\nAnd most obvious flaw: the model is still trained purely on Next-Token Prediction, predicting the immediate future.\n\nThis objective forces the model to be \"greedy\" and short-sighted. It optimizes for the statistically most probable next word, not necessarily the best long-term answer or logical deduction.",

It uses learned absolute positional embeddings tied to `block_size`, so it won’t generalize past the trained context length. That’s a known limitation of early GPT-style models. Modern systems use RoPE, ALiBi, etc., but microGPT avoids those on purpose — it’s meant to show the minimal core algorithm.\n\nOn next-token prediction: the model is trained to maximize  \nP(next\\_token | previous\\_tokens),  \nwhich factorizes the full joint distribution. So in theory it’s not inherently “short-sighted.” Greediness mainly comes from decoding strategy (e.g., greedy decoding vs sampling), not the objective itself.\n\nThat said, you’re right that NTP doesn’t explicitly optimize long-term planning or reasoning — that’s where things like RLHF, search, or structured reasoning techniques come in.\n\nmicroGPT isn’t trying to fix those issues — it’s trying to expose the fundamental Transformer mechanics as cleanly as possible.",

      "text": "I love playing around with RAG and AI, optimizing every layer to squeeze out better performance. Last night I thought: why not tackle something massive?\n\nTook the Epstein Files dataset from Hugging Face (teyler/epstein-files-20k) – 2 million+ pages of trending news and documents. The cleaning, chunking, and optimization challenges are exactly what excites me.\n\nWhat I built:\n\n\\- Full RAG pipeline with optimized data processing\n\n\\- Processed 2M+ pages (cleaning, chunking, vectorization)\n\n\\- Semantic search & Q&A over massive dataset\n\n\\- Constantly tweaking for better retrieval & performance\n\n\\- Python, MIT Licensed, open source\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nIt’s trending, real-world data at scale, the perfect playground.\n\nWhen you operate at scale, every optimization matters. This project lets me experiment with RAG architectures, data pipelines, and AI performance tuning on real-world workloads.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG](https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG)\n\nOpen to ideas, optimizations, and technical discussions!",

Did you construct a labeled query set, or are you relying mostly on qualitative inspection?\n\nWith RAG in particular, chunking strategy and embedding choice often dominate performance more than downstream model tweaks. It would be helpful to see ablations on chunk size, overlap, and indexing strategy. At that scale, even small retrieval improvements can meaningfully change end to end behavior.\n\nAlso, how are you handling deduplication and noisy documents? Large news style corpora can inflate index size without adding much signal. that trade off becomes pretty important once you move beyond toy datasets.",

Running a high end gpu at full speed uses 400g of carbon per hour.\n\nAs for LLMS gpt 3 (when this guys says ai he probably means llms) had a 500 metric tones of co2 as a consequence of training. Meaning we need around 5 billion queries (without considering the extra carbon related to infering or Sending the data around, which would likely around double the number of queries) to match that.\n\nGpt3 is one of many many models and every new model has a bigger cost in energy and carbon to train and run. Gpt5 is estimated to be hundreds to thousands or times costlier to train and inference is estimated to be 20 times more expensive, meaning a conservative guess would be breaking even to streaming at around 500 BILLION queries, but probably closer to a couple trillion without considering inference.\n\nIs every model released by deepseek, gemini, gpt, llama, grok, answering enough questions in their \"year of relevance\" until a new one comes out to break even? And are the query counts increasing enough to justify the growth into more and more expensive models?",

However, if you PROMPT the AI to give you answers in such a way that it increases your logical reasoning by not giving straight away answers,  but only hints and in a way it builds your developer intuition, THEN BOOM you get completely different answers.\nYou get more like a puzzle, but now you know where to start with. Which gradually, would improve.\nAltho, if you're using AI simply to decode hard textbook-language in an easy-to-understand way, then it's not bad.",

I would say the parts that is non-trivial is the part you should take as exercise to prove why it's true, as you've already noticed Goodfellow et al tends to make a lot of concise statement that are non-obvious (I remember one small paragraph in chapter 4 on optimization that lead to around 1-2page of proof, something about Hessians, second order directional derivatives, eigenvalues etc). I think it's a good book that goes the basic DL theory in a more mathematical way, especially the optimization parts (although very basic) and regularization, more than Prince and Bishop.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for more modern theory like generative modelling (diffusion and normalizing flows), llms, reinforcement learning, geometric deep learning, then a general book for that is Bishop or Prince. Prince is by far the easiest to go through, while Bishop is almost as hard as Goodfellow, a little easier though. If you want to go through each of these big topics in isolation there are specialized book for that, but if just want a general book that provides the basic then the aforementioned books are good.\n\nEdit: Also skip the backprop section of chap 6, I think Karpathy does a wonderful intuitive presentation of backprop and does it with code also! The backprop section in chap 6 is unecessarily convoluted for my taste. If you want some exercises on that you can also try to implement the minitorch part 1 assignment to see how autodiff is implemented with code (you create the framework to save the things you need in a computational graph and then use topological sort to rearrange the nodes to apply backprop...something like that). Also skip the RNN and CNN parts, I think there are better guides for that on the internet nowadays, youtube, cs231 for cnn or Colah blog for lstm + RNN.",

      "text": "This is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately.\n\nSoftware engineering used to feel like the golden path. High pay, tons of demand, solid job security. Then bootcamps blew up, CS enrollments exploded, and now it feels pretty saturated at the entry level. On top of that, AI tools are starting to automate parts of coding, which makes the future feel a bit uncertain.\n\nNow I’m wondering if machine learning is heading in the same direction.\n\nML pays a lot of money right now. The salaries are honestly a big part of why people are drawn to it. But I’m seeing more and more people pivot into ML, more courses, more degrees, more certifications. Some universities are even starting dedicated AI degrees now. It feels like everyone wants in. At the same time, tools are getting better. With foundation models and high-level frameworks, you don’t always need to build things from scratch anymore.\n\nAs a counterpoint though, ML is definitely harder than traditional CS in a lot of ways. The math, the theory, reading research papers, running experiments. The learning curve feels steeper. It’s not something you can just pick up in a few months and be truly good at. So maybe that barrier keeps it from becoming as saturated as general software engineering?\n\nI’m personally interested in going into AI and robotics, specifically machine learning or computer vision at robotics companies. That’s the long-term goal. I don’t know if this is still a smart path or if it’s going to become overcrowded and unstable in the next 5 to 10 years.\n\nWould love to hear from people already in ML or robotics. Is it still worth it? Or are we heading toward the same issues that SWE is facing?",

I keep running into situations where traditional ML or even simple scripts would have been way more efficient. \n\nTake repetitive tasks, for instance. Why complicate things with an agentic system when a straightforward script can handle it just fine? Or consider pure prediction problems—traditional ML models often outperform these complex systems. \n\nIt feels like there’s a lot of hype around agentic AI, but people seem to forget that simpler solutions often work better for many tasks. I’d love to hear from others: what are some specific tasks where you’ve found traditional methods outperform agentic AI? Are there any examples where agentic AI was overkill?",

It effectively established that publicly traded companies *must* act in the interest of their shareholders. These companies must produce quarterly earnings reports for their shareholders, which is why publicly traded companies seem so short-sighted - investors want the stock price to go up next quarter. This basically means that *publicly traded companies have an obligation to drum up investor confidence*.\n\nCompanies that produce LLMs (ChatGPT, Anthropic, etc.) turned \"AI\" into *the* hot marketing buzzword of the past several years. Also consider that company leadership is usually dominated by MBAs over technical people. Most CEOs aren't ML practitioners, and don't understand the true capabilities or limitations of LLMs, but they do know that it has been the marketing buzzword of the past several years. \n\nSo now, companies are trying to publicly \"embrace AI\" or be \"AI first\" in an effort to drum up investor confidence. We're starting to see the peak of this as consumers are beginning to resent AI implementations being shoehorned in to replace both user-friendly design and employees alike.\n\n**TLDR:** Leadership of publicly traded companies must act solely to the benefit of their investors, generally by creating excitement for potential investors and increasing the stock price, even if it means developing worse products.",

The concept in itself should be straigh forward, the inductive bias is: **Expect a linear relationship between the features** (the input) **and the predicted value** (the output) and this should result geometrically in a straight line if the training data has only 1 feature, a flat plane if it has 2 features and so on.\n\nI don't understand how could a straight line overly adapt to the data if it's straight. I see how it could underfit but not overfit.\n\nThis can happen of course with polynomial regression which results in curved lines and planes, in that case the solution to overfit should be reducing the features or using regularization which weights the parameters of the function resulting in a curve that fits better the data.\n\nIn theory this makes sense but I keep seeing examples online where linear regression is used to illustrate overfitting.\n\nIs polynomial regression a type of linear regression?

A \"y=mx+c\" line is fit to a sample of the data and fails to generalise. Failure to generalise is the whole point of the concept of \"fitness\", but the problem is that the sample used to train the model does not represent the whole data eg higher gradient\n\n2. Too complex. If the true relationship is of the form \"y=mx\", but the model learns on offset, so \"y=mx+c\". This can be different from 1 if your data has a couple of inconvenient outliers. This is a classic case of an over parametrised model\n\n3. The model is not order 1 linear, but the data is order 1 linear. Basically people use language how they like and sometimes even respectably knowledgeable people use linear to mean \"a line of best fit\" so categorically include functions with more degrees of freedom (eg splines and polynomials)",

Missing data is more about *why* it’s missing than which fancy method you use.\n\nModels usually come last, starting with simple baselines. Biggest difference I’ve noticed is seniors are really good at knowing when their model won’t work.",
