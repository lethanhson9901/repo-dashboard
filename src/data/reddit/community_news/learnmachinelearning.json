I rewrote some key signal processing code for an embedded system for a former employer in x86 with SSE2 and some other vectorization instructions available on our platform.  Got over 90% speed up compared to our “optimized” C.\n\nYour work is on another level and you remind me of Steve Gibson of Spinrite fame that made all his tools in assembly for both DOS and Windows.  Amazing having a fully featured Windows app in a few dozen kilobytes.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Gibson_(computer_programmer)",

What I mean is did u test validation on 20-50 epoch on 10k size dataset with size Float32, or something of the sorts, or you went directly for int8.\n\nLearning rates, how did you manage them, did u keep it static, decay , warmups or anything, did u shuffle the dataset for getting it' into normal distribution.\n\nAmazing work overall",

      "text": "\nI recently landed an AI Engineer role after a pretty intense job hunt, and I thought I had shared some tips on how to crack it especially in this crazy 2025/2026 market where everyone's chasing AI jobs. It is tough out there, but totally doable if you focus on the right stuff. Here's what worked for me and what I have seen from friends who made it too. My background is software development with 6 years of experience. As lot of my existing project moved to AI so that's why I decided to change my domain to AI/ML. Frankly, Domain change is a tough task, not just about learning a new tech stack altogether and cracking an interview(this is easy actually), but when you start working in a company as AI Engineer, then real challenges come for the initial 4-5 months.\nBelow is my preparation strategy\n\n1. BUILD FOUNDATIONS:\n\nPython is a must. Around 70–80% of AI ML job postings expect solid Python skills, so there is no way around it.\n\nGet comfortable with core libraries:\n\n• NumPy & Pandas for data handling\n• Scikit learn for classic machine learning\n• PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning\n\nFor interviews, don’t just rely on theory. I personally spent months grinding LeetCode for coding rounds, but I also practiced ML specific coding, like:\n\n• Implementing gradient descent from scratch\n• Writing a basic neural network without using high level APIs\n\nMath matters more than people admit. You don’t need to be a math genius, but you should understand:\n\n• Linear algebra\n• Basic calculus\n• Probability and statistics\n\nUsually, the interviewers evaluate concepts such as bias variance tradeoff, regularization, overfitting vs underfitting, and the reasons why the model acts that way.\n\nAlthough I believe in self learning, there are some decent courses to make thins little faster. As its a new domain all together there are a lot of chances. I may be confused or take wrong direction. Below are some of my preferred course suggestions that significantly contributed to my strong foundation and keeping up-to-date with AI Engineer positions:\n\n• Coursera – Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization: A classic course to understand ML theory and intuition, ideal if you are revisiting the basics.\n\n• Fast ai – Practical Deep Learning for Coders: Free course with hands-on PyTorch exercises, teaches you to build real world models quickly without focusing too much on the math initially.\n\n• LogicMojo AI/ML Course : A course that teaches AI & ML basics through project work and practical exercises, beneficial for both theoretical and practical knowledge. I developed my AI project under the guidance of mentor.\n\n• Udemy Self paced: Inexpensive courses with lots of programming tasks; opt for those that are portfolio-oriented using tools such as LangChain or\n\n2. BUILD REAL, HANDS ON PROJECTS:\n\nProjects make or break your profile. Recruiter’s love seeing a GitHub with real, working stuff, not just notebooks that never left your laptop.\n\nFocus on end to end projects where you handle everything:\n\ndata → model → API → deployment.\n\nSome projects that helped me stand out:\n\n• A RAG system using LangChain.\n• Fine tuning a small LLM on Hugging Face for a custom use case.\n• A computer vision project like image classification or object detection.\n• Kaggle competitions are underrated gold. Even if you don’t rank high, participation shows curiosity, consistency, and real problem solving.\n\nTry deploying at least one project. Use AWS, GCP, or Vercel anything that proves you can ship.\n\nLearn basic MLOps:\n\n• Docker\n• Model versioning\n• Simple CI/CD\n\nThis part really helps because a lot of “AI professionals” can train models, but can’t productionize them and companies care about production.\n\n3.

As these systems improve through training on real-world examples, which is a core principle of machine learning. Instead of following some random logics, they predict likely outcomes based on learned behavior. This makes vibe coding a practical application of machine learning in everyday software development.",

LLM doesn't \"understand\" the higher-order consequence that \"fixing A might break B.\" It only knows to maximize the probability of the next token given the immediate fine-tuning examples. And that's all.\n\nAlso, there's no architectural mechanism for **multi-objective optimization** or **trade-off reasoning** during gradient descent.

It's more about  the underlying architecture's lack of mechanisms for the kind of reasoning I described.\n\nI.e. whether the driver is CE or a RL reward function, the transformer is ultimately being guided to produce a sequence of tokens that scores well **against** that specific, immediate objective.\n\nThis is why I see current SOTA reasoning methods as compensations, a crutch, an ugly one. Yep, as Deepsek had shown, these crutches can be brilliant and effective, but they are ultimately working around a core architectural gap rather than solving it from first principles.\n\nIMHO SSMs like Mamba and its successors could help here, by offering efficient long-context processing and a selective state mechanism. SSMs have their own pain points, yet these two SSM features would lay a foundation to  models that can genuinely weigh trade-offs during the act of generation, not just use SOTA crutches.",

      "text": "Just last year, I was a software developer mostly creating web applications, working on backend services, APIs, and the regular CRUD operations using Python and JavaScript. Good job, good payment, but I thought I was missing the part of tech that was really thrilling. Currently, I work as an AI Engineer building applications based on LLM and deploying the models. It was a long journey of about 18 months, but it definitely paid off.\n\n If you are a programmer and think about changing your career path, here is the very same roadmap I utilized. It is hands on, aimed at quickly real stuff and makes use of your present coding abilities which is the major plus of AI engineering as it is 70% software development anyway. No PhD required just keep working on projects and acquire knowledge through practice.\n\n TIME & COST REALITY CHECK:\n\nReal talk on timeline and cost. I did this over 18 months while working full time about 10 to 15 hours per week on learning and projects.\n\nMonths 1-3 → Foundations\n\nMonths 4-10 → Core ML and DL + early projects\n\nMonths 11-18 → Modern AI, MLOps, portfolio, and job hunting.\n\nAlmost everything is free today like YouTube, official docs, Google Colab for GPUs. Self study works great for developers, but if you want structure and accountability, paid options help a lot.\n\nPHASE 1: How Basics are dealt with (1 TO 2 MONTHS):\n\nI already knew Python well, so I skipped the beginner stuff. But if your knowledge of python is not fresh, then spend a week on advanced topics like decorators, async, and virtual environments.\n\n Then, I dove into the math and ML foundations just enough to not feel lost:\n\n* Linear algebra, probability, and stats by Khan Academy videos + 3Blue1Brown's essence of linear algebra series.\n* Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera, the classic one, is free and explains things intuitively.\n\nThis gave me the \"why\" behind algorithms without overwhelming me.\n\n   \nPHASE 2: CORE MACHINE LEARNING & DEEP LEARNING (2 TO 3 MONTHS):\n\nI went ahead and got my hands dirty with the practical ML:\n\n* Fast ai's Practical Deep Learning course is a really good option. I got to create my own models from the very first day.\n* Next, I took Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization which is all about TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n\n The main libraries I learned were: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for the basics, followed by PyTorch which I took over TensorFlow because it is more Pythonic and dominant in 2025.\n\n The projects I worked on were simple but very important:\n\n1. Made a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering on a dataset from Kaggle.\n2. Conducted image classification with CNNs on the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n3. Performed sentiment analysis of Twitter data using NLP basics with the help of Hugging Face transformers early on.\n\nThey were all deployed on Streamlit for quick and easy web demonstrations that are super easy as a developer.\n\n RESOURCES & COURSES (WHAT ACTUALLY HELPED):\n\nI have such a clear mind about this. I was a full time earnings person. I needed live doubt clearing and project feedback. Watching recorded videos alone wasn’t enough. So here is how I looked at learning options.\n\nSelf Study resources:\n\n1. Coursera’s ML Specialization:\n\nStill the best for building strong ML foundations. Clear explanations, no noise.\n\n1. Fast ai:\n\nCompletely free and very practical. Helps you build intuition fast \n\nThese are amazing, but they require strong self discipline. I saved money this way, but progress can get slow if you are busy in office. Structured programs are better if you work full time.   \n  \n3. LogicMojo AI & ML Course : One option personally good for working developers is LogicMojo’s AI & ML program. I feel complex topic like Deeplearning and genAI you can only learn with projects. I feel this course was good for practical based approach for preparation.  \n  \nA few things that seemed useful for people who needed structure:\n\nIt goes from classic ML → Deep Learning → GenAI\n\n*  Strong focus on real projects\n* Includes DSA + system thinking.\n* Guided prep helps reduce trial and error during job switches\n\nThis is just one example similar cohort programs can work if they fit your schedule and learning style.\n\nMy honest take, \n\nSelf study = cheaper, flexible, but needs discipline. \n\nStructured programs = costlier, but keep you consistent and accountable\n\nThere is no arguably one \"best.\" Rather, there is a \"fit\" that attends to and collaborates with the schedule's energy in terms of learning style. The platform becomes inconsequential compared to the consistency.\n\n PHASE 3: DIVE INTO MODERN AI (3 TO 4 MONTHS):\n\nThis is where it got fun and where most AI engineer jobs are in 2025. Traditional ML is table stakes companies want people who can build with LLMs.\n\nResources:\n\n* LangChain docs and tutorials for chaining models, agents, etc.\n* Hugging Face courses on transformers and fine tuning.\n*  Pinecone for vector databases.\n\nProjects that leveled me up:\n\n1. A RAG chatbot: Uploaded PDFs, used embeddings + retrieval to answer questions with GPT-3.5 via OpenAI API. Added memory for conversation history.\n2. Custom fine tuned model: Took Llama 2 open source, fine tuned on a small dataset for code review.\n3. Multi modal app: Built an image captioning + question answering tool with CLIP and BLIP models.\n\nA very clean code GitHub repository with exhaustive README files and demonstrations was the primary reason for recruiters’ positive reaction to access to deployed apps.\n\n  \nPHASE 4: MLOPS, DEPLOYMENT, AND PRODUCTION BASICS (2 MONTHS):\n\nAs a developer, this was my superpower. AI folks often struggle with scaling, but I already knew Docker, etc.\n\nLearned:\n\n* FastAPI for building APIs around models.\n* Docker basics for containerizing.\n* For the purpose of tracking experiments, MLflow or Weights & Biases can be used.\n* In terms of cloud deployment, AWS SageMaker or GCP Vertex AI will be the choices.\n\nProject:\n\n1. Took my RAG app, containerized it, added monitoring for token usage, latency, and deployed to AWS. Simulated production issues like rate limits and fallbacks.\n\n\n\nMAJOR PROBLEM I FACED:\n\n* Math overload avoids paralysis by proof work in small incremental.Tutorial hell after every course and video, force yourself to build something original even if it is bad at first.\n* Skipping deployment early to deploy every project, even simple ones on Streamlit. Production problems teach way more than perfect Jupyter notebooks.\n* Burnout I only did deep work on weekends and evenings. Set small weekly goals, not daily marathons.\n\n \n\nPHASE 5: READY FOR INTERVIEWS (3 TO 6 MONTHS):\n\n* A construction of web pages representing oneself will be the main platform for five to six different projects with their live demos, source links, and discussions about problems.\n* Posted on LinkedIn about my progress, and contributed to open source.\n\n \n\nPHASE 6: INTERVIEW EXPERIENCE(QUESTIONS):\n\nML Interviews\n\n1. Most questions were about understanding and decision making, not math heavy theory.\n2. Explain the bias variance tradeoff in simple terms\n3. Why are neural networks usually not the first choice for tabular data?\n4. How do you handle imbalanced datasets in real projects?\n5. How would you evaluate and monitor a model in production, not just offline?\n\n \n\nCoding Rounds:\n\n1. Coding was not hardcore DSA.\n2. Python data manipulation (Pandas, lists, dictionaries)\n3. ML related logic problems\n4. Focus on clarity and correctness, not LeetCode hard puzzles.\n\n\n\nSystem Design:\n\n1. These rounds tested how well you think end-to-end.\n2. Design an AI recommendation system\n3. Design a fraud detection system\n4. Design a chatbot architecture (LLM + backend + data flow)\n\n \n\nKey takeaway: Interviewers valued structured thinking and clear answers over \"correct\" ones.\n\nSwitching to AI is not about knowing everything. It is about building the right skills, thinking clearly, and showing real world impact through projects. This is just one path, not the only one. If you are consistent and focus on real projects, the transition is very doable especially if you already have software experience.\n\n",

If you want to start, the first thing every source of information will lead you to is classical ML Linear Regression California Housing Price prediction. Next is classification use case, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning etc. Once you learn a few ML algorithms, then you'd build an end to end ML project. Neural Network is the natural next step. This would bring you to tensorflow and pytorch. From here, application development with LLM is next step. Then deployment. Personally for me, I already knew MERN stack, learnt FastAPI so building chatbots was pretty straightforward.\n\nI dived in to all this with the mindset of having a good understanding of everything about ML/AI. From that standpoint, this roadmap unfolds automatically.\n\nThis roadmap does not stop, once you are able to build applications, RAG, MCP, agents etc, its now the question of optimization. Why one thing over the other? System design basically.",

Then I got into building telephone chatbots (before they were cool) and then learned some linear algebra as a consequence of wanting to understand convolutions better. \n\nIMO just follow what you find interesting and make sure you understand what’s going on. Who cares if you do linear regression or whatever. I don’t like formulaic learning. Sure most courses teach things in a similar way, so if you want to be like everyone else then you can take them i guess. And that’s not to say they aren’t worthwhile, those two things aren’t mutually exclusive.\n\nI agree with you that the roadmap unfolds automatically which is why I asked if the OP was backwards-fitting to his experience. I think largely, people who are “successful” at something don’t rely on run of the mill roadmap posts on reddit lol. You’ve already opened the wrong door as soon as you start looking for a 12-month roadmap tbh.",

HMMs, Viterbi decoding, n-gram smoothing, statistical methods that felt completely obsolete once Transformers took over.\n\nI left research in 2019 thinking my technical foundation was a sunk cost. Something to not mention in interviews.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe field circled back. The cutting-edge solutions to problems LLMs can't solve—efficient long-context modeling, structured output, model robustness—are built on the same principles I learned in 2015.\n\nA few examples:\n\n* **Mamba** (the main Transformer alternative) is mathematically a continuous Hidden Markov Model. If you understand HMMs, you understand Mamba faster than someone who only knows attention.\n* **Constrained decoding** (getting LLMs to output valid JSON) is the Viterbi algorithm applied to neural language models. Same search problem, same solution structure.\n* **Model merging** (combining fine-tuned models) uses the same variance-reduction logic as n-gram smoothing from the 1990s.\n\nI wrote a longer piece connecting my old research to current methods: \\[https://medium.com/@tahaymerghani/i-thought-my-nlp-training-was-obsolete-in-the-llm-era-i-was-wrong-c4be804d9f69?postPublishedType=initial\\]\n\nIf you're learning ML now, my advice: don't skip the \"old\" stuff. The methods change. The problems don't. Understanding probability, search, and state management will serve you longer than memorizing the latest architecture.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the research or the path.",

A simple bigram model with beam search is still the easiest and fastest way to get such a production level spelling correction in a specific domain. The responses are all under 10ms. I'm yet to measure the F1 score though, but so far it looks promising.\n\n\nOf course I can take a mini transformer and fine tune it for my domain, and I'll do it for fun, but having a quick baseline implementation is still valuable. ",

      "text": "This guide covers the 10 classical machine learning algorithms every fresher should learn. Each algorithm is explained with why it matters, how it works at a basic level, and when you should use it. By the end, you'll have a solid foundation to tackle real-world machine learning problems.\n\n**1. Linear Regression**\n\n**What it does:** Linear Regression models the relationship between input features and a continuous target value using a straight line (or hyperplane in multiple dimensions).\n\n**Why learn it:** This is the starting point for understanding machine learning mathematically. It teaches you about loss functions, gradients, and how models learn from data. Linear Regression is simple but powerful for many real-world problems like predicting house prices, stock values, or sales forecasts.\n\n**When to use it:** Use Linear Regression when you have a continuous target variable and suspect a linear relationship between features and the target. It's fast, interpretable, and works well as a baseline model.\n\n**Real example:** Predicting apartment rent based on square footage, location, and amenities.\n\n2. Logistic Regression\n\n**What it does:** Despite its name, Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm. It predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class, typically used for binary classification (yes/no, spam/not spam).\n\n**Why learn it:** Logistic Regression is everywhere in industry. It's used in fraud detection, email spam filtering, disease diagnosis, and customer churn prediction. Understanding it teaches you about probabilities, decision boundaries, and how to convert regression into classification.\n\n**When to use it:** Use it for binary classification problems where you need interpretable results and probability estimates. It's also a great baseline for classification tasks.\n\n**Real example:** Predicting whether a customer will buy a product (yes/no) based on their browsing history and demographics.\n\n3. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n\n**What it does**: KNN classifies data points based on the classes of their k nearest neighbors in the training dataset. If most neighbours belong to class A, the new point is classified as A.\n\n**Why learn it:** KNN is intuitive and teaches you about distance metrics (how to measure similarity between data points). It's a lazy learning algorithm, meaning it doesn't build a model during training but instead stores all training data and makes predictions at test time.\n\n**When to use it:** Use KNN for small to medium-sized datasets where you need a simple, interpretable classifier. It works well for image recognition, recommendation systems, and pattern matching.\n\n**Real example:** Recommending movies to a user based on movies watched by similar users.\n\n**4. Naive Bayes**\n\n**What it does:** Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes that all features are independent of each other (the \"naive\" assumption) and calculates the probability of each class given the features.\n\n**Why learn it:** Naive Bayes is fast, scalable, and surprisingly effective despite its simplistic assumptions. It's widely used in text classification, spam detection, and sentiment analysis. Understanding it teaches you about probability and Bayesian thinking.\n\n**When to use it:** Use Naive Bayes for text classification, spam detection, and when you need a fast, lightweight classifier. It works especially well with high-dimensional data like text.\n\n**Real example:** Classifying emails as spam or not spam based on word frequencies.\n\n**5. Decision Trees**\n\n**What it does:** Decision Trees make predictions by recursively splitting data based on feature values. Each split creates a branch, and the tree continues until it reaches a leaf node that makes a prediction.\n\n**Why learn it:** Decision Trees are highly intuitive and interpretable. You can visualize exactly how the model makes decisions. They also teach you about feature importance and how to handle both classification and regression problems.\n\n**When to use it:** Use Decision Trees when you need interpretability and can afford some overfitting. They work well for both classification and regression and handle non-linear relationships naturally.\n\n**Real example:** Deciding whether to approve a loan based on credit score, income, and employment history.\n\n**6. Random Forest**\n\n**What it does:** Random Forest combines multiple Decision Trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Each tree is trained on a random subset of data and features, and predictions are made by averaging (regression) or voting (classification) across all trees.\n\n**Why learn it:** Random Forest is powerful out-of-the-box and often works well without much tuning. It's one of the most popular algorithms in industry because it balances accuracy with interpretability. Understanding ensemble methods is crucial for modern machine learning.\n\n**When to use it:** Use Random Forest as your first choice for most classification and regression problems. It handles missing values, non-linear relationships, and feature interactions well.\n\n**Real example:** Predicting customer churn by combining predictions from multiple decision trees trained on different data subsets.\n\n**7. Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n\n**What it does:** SVM finds the optimal boundary (hyperplane) that separates classes by maximising the margin between them. It can also handle non-linear problems using kernel tricks.\n\n**Why learn it:** SVM has strong theoretical foundations and works exceptionally well for high-dimensional data. Understanding SVM teaches you about optimization, margins, and kernel methods—concepts that appear throughout machine learning.\n\n**When to use it:** Use SVM for binary classification problems, especially with high-dimensional data. It's particularly effective for text classification and image recognition.\n\n**Real example:** Classifying handwritten digits (0-9) in image recognition tasks.\n\n**8. k-Means Clustering**\n\n**What it does:** k-Means is an unsupervised algorithm that groups data points into k clusters based on similarity. It iteratively assigns points to the nearest cluster center and updates centers until convergence.\n\n**Why learn it:** k-Means introduces you to unsupervised learning and clustering concepts. It's simple, fast, and widely used for customer segmentation, image compression, and data exploration.\n\n**When to use it:** Use k-Means when you want to discover natural groupings in unlabeled data. It's great for exploratory data analysis and customer segmentation.\n\n**Real example:** Grouping customers into segments based on purchase behavior for targeted marketing.\n\n**9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**\n\n**What it does:** PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms features into a smaller set of uncorrelated components that capture most of the variance in the data.\n\n**Why learn it:** PCA teaches you about feature reduction, which is crucial for handling high-dimensional data. It helps with visualization, noise removal, and improving model performance by reducing computational complexity.\n\n**When to use it:** Use PCA when you have many features and want to reduce dimensionality while preserving information. It's useful for visualization, noise reduction, and speeding up model training.\n\n**Real example:** Reducing 784 pixel features in handwritten digit images to 50 principal components for faster classification.\n\n**10. Gradient Boosting (GBM)**\n\n**What it does:** Gradient Boosting builds models sequentially, where each new model corrects errors made by previous models. It combines weak learners (usually decision trees) into a strong predictor.\n\n**Why learn it:** Gradient Boosting is the foundation for modern tools like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost that dominate machine learning competitions and industry applications. Understanding it prepares you for state-of-the-art techniques.\n\n**When to use it:** Use Gradient Boosting for both classification and regression when you want maximum accuracy. It requires careful tuning but often produces the best results.\n\n**Real example:** Predicting house prices by sequentially building trees that correct previous prediction errors.\n\n",

I understand that these implementations are almost never used in real-world projects, and that libraries like scikit-learn are the standard. My motivation would be purely to gain a deeper understanding of how the algorithms actually work.\nOr is doing this a waste of time, and it’s enough to focus on understanding the algorithms mathematically and conceptually, without coding them from scratch?\nIf implementing them is considered important or beneficial, is it acceptable to use AI tools to help with writing the code, as long as I fully understand what the code is doing?",

Coming up with alternatives and reasoning which is better can also help.\n\nEven better, sometimes, very rarely, it doesn’t make sense even after you’ve exhausted this process, and if you can't find a mention of the tension in literature - then sometimes this is where you may have just found something brand new to explore, and follow that rabbit hole till its end :) \n\nfor me this was “*how the hell do networks know where neurons point to *tend* to assign them meaning, something must ‘reveal’ them*” and “*why are activation functions square?!*” that’s been a very enjoyable rabbit hole I could only pick up from first principles.",

Nothing like MIT’s public 6.S191 lectures (the main reason people enroll). Those lectures are concept-driven and motivating; this course is rigid, procedural, and pedagogically shallow.\n3. Poorly designed and internally inconsistent. The course oscillates between advanced topics (Week 1: implement Gradient Descent) and trivial Python basics (Week 2: assign x = 2), signaling a lack of coherent instructional design and unclear audience definition.\n4. No stated prerequisites or pre-reading. Concepts appear with little context, leading to unnecessary frustration even in Week 1.\n5. Pedantic, inflexible module unlocking.

Class specific questions are often designed to test your recall and comprehension of specifically what was covered, regardless of whether that knowledge is especially relevant elsewhere. I wouldn't even expect these to come up all together in a viva or exam of some sort which is testing you at the end of the whole degree.\n\nEspecially the one that mentions SimCLR looks like such a specific question referencing the particular demonstrative examples used in class, rather than an actual comparison of things anyone outside that class would be expected to automatically recognize. Lecturers use examples they know or which are useful for demonstrating a specific point - that doesn't necessarily mean you will ever need to consider those specific examples in the future.\n\nThis isn't even about the theoretical knowledge needed for research vs practice. It's about reviewing specifically what things were covered in the course, for the purpose of demonstrating or examining a broader concept or way of thinking, which is the important part. \n\nI've used the specific knowledge and concepts covered in the linear regression, dropout, and multitask prediction questions in doing my ML research. But not any of the others. No single researcher is using all of these concepts in their research and certainly not off the top of their head.\n\nIt's useful in teaching and in practice to be able to think and talk comparatively about different methods and algorithms for a particular task, but it's unlikely someone not doing work specifically in contrastive learning would need to know those specific methods. And a researcher would likely need to be familiar with several other approaches. \n\nDon't confuse (or dismiss!) the pedagogical approach used to demonstrate a concept that is crucial to know with specific knowledge needed in practice. Just because your professor introduced certain papers or methods doesn't mean they are the most relevant or comprehensive; but it also doesn't mean they're irrelevant. They may have been useful specifically for teaching the concept the professor wanted you to understand and that's it. \n\nTo your last point, as someone who very much does do research in ML (and teaches it), what is absurd is the idea that even a researcher in ML would need to be able to answer the set of these very specific questions. They'd be able to for the one or two relevant to their research and have only a surface level off hand knowledge of the others.",

I might have known them before and still know the general concept but not remember the specific term (I bet this is the case for most AI/DL people who learned about Moore Penrose but haven't needed to dive deep into linear regression since uni) or for some (like simCLR) I've just not read the relevant paper or needed what it does so I have never even heard of it. \n\nA lot of them are irrelevant to actually doing ML, others would maybe show up specifically in a quiz for a specialized class or only at the end of the textbook chapter and others are just poorly formed.\n\nAs others have said, they feel like they're from someone who is a bit insecure in their competence and trying to show off to compensate. Or from someone who is going through a textbook and temporarily feels confident but hasn't actually used the concepts for long enough to know what knowledge sticks around.\n\nTo expand on the 'textbook questions' point: I know some of the guys who have written these textbooks and for the most part even they couldn't answer every single revision question at the end of all their chapters without reviewing. Advanced textbooks are comprehensive, but for a lot of specific points, only 1 in 100 professionals would actually regularly need to retain that knowledge and no single professional needs 100% of it. So asking a bunch of very specific questions as a universal quiz will necessarily mean some talented people will get some while others will get other questions, but basically no one would get them all.\n\nSo someone who needs to retain knowledge about Moore Penrose vs gradient descent in linear regression probably isn't the same person who needs to know about layers in fine tuning, isn't the person who remembers specifics of General Continual Learning. They may have used it once or read about it, but no one needs to retain all of this together.",

The hard decision-making still relies on deterministic or discriminative models (depends on the problem of course), and the generative side sits on top to explain, summarize, or present the result in a more human-friendly way. That setup gives you reliability in the core logic while still improving the UX and reducing the risk of hallucinations where correctness really matters.\n\nI put together a short breakdown of that trade-off using a real-world example, and I’d be curious to hear whether others have seen similar hybrid patterns in production ML.\n\n[https://blog.nastaran.ai/p/generative-ai-vs-discriminative-models](https://blog.nastaran.ai/p/generative-ai-vs-discriminative-models)",

I have participated in multiple researches but I lack the skills to be an AI Engineer. I don't know Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud platform like AWS or Azure and any front or back end, while only knowing basic Git. \nCan anyone please help me in sharing a path to learn how to be an AI Engineer.

          "text": "* Start “deployment” with 1 simple shape: wrap a trained model behind a small REST API (FastAPI is the usual pick). Goal: POST /predict returns JSON, plus a /health endpoint.\n* Make it portable: learn Docker next (one Dockerfile, one docker run). If you can containerize your API, you’re 80% less lost.\n* Learn the “prod triangle”: logging + basic monitoring + error handling (structured logs, request time, retries/timeouts). This is what makes a demo feel “real.”\n* Add CI basics: GitHub Actions to run tests + linting on every push. Doesn’t need to be fancy, just consistent.\n* Then pick ONE hosting lane (don’t collect clouds): deploy the container to a managed service (e.g., a simple container hosting platform) before you touch Kubernetes.\n* Only after that: learn K8s if job posts in your area actually demand it. Most entry roles value “I can ship an API” more than “I can name 12 K8s objects.”\n* Portfolio tip: 2 small end-to-end projects beats 10 notebooks. Example: “document classifier API” + “LLM RAG Q&A API” with a tiny README and curl examples.",

If you want a single DataCamp pathway that lines up with deployment + real projects, the Machine Learning Engineer with Python career track is usually the closest match. It walks you from Python fundamentals through applied ML and into the kind of end-to-end thinking (clean data → model → evaluate → deploy patterns) that actually shows up in junior AI/ML engineering roles.\n\nLink: [http://datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-engineer](http://datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-engineer) \n\nIt's 44 hours to complete, so if you get DataCamp for a month, you could complete that, plus maybe a couple of other courses:\n\n\\- [https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deploying-ai-into-production-with-fastapi](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deploying-ai-into-production-with-fastapi) (Focuses on how to wrap a model behind a REST endpoint you can actually call from a web app or service, which is a core part of “making models live\")  \n\\- [http://datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-docker](http://datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-docker) (Teaches how to containerize your app so it can run anywhere locally or in the cloud without configuration headaches)\n\nIf you want even more applied cloud context after those, cloud computing courses are great next steps, but you don’t need to master them before building your first deployable project.",

          "text": "You should not think about the whole algorithm at once, but rather the steps leading to it. Let's say you want to classify data into two categories. Drawing a linear decision boundary is a simple solution, but that's not always possible - your vector space might not have enough \"space\" to allow it.\n\n\nHow do you fix it? You embed your space into a higher-dimensional space, e.g. with a polynomial embedding. However, if your decision boundary is complex your polynomial embedding will get computationally expensive very quickly.\n\n\nWhat's the solution? You want to embed into an infinite-dimensional space with an inner product (a Hilbert Space), surely this will have enough \"space\" to draw any decision boundary you need. The key insight is that you don't need the whole (infinite-dimensional) vector of each data point for your calculations as the decision boundary is fully characterized by a an element of the dual space, e.g. (w, -) the dot product with a vector w. So it's enough for you to know how some (basis-)vectors interact in the inner product (since it is linear) and the Kernel matrix tells you exactly that. Of course one could embed the points differently into the Hilbert Space, this is what the different Kernels do.\n\n\nNow that you have enough space, how do you find such an optimal decision boundary? You formulate it as an optimization problem. You should probably think about how you would do this, as the problem arises quite naturally. For starters you can assume that there exists a clean decision boundary, e.g. all points can be linearly separated in the Hilbert Space. Then one could add a penalty term to allow for some points to be misclassified.\nThe resulting optimization problem can be solved directly, but there is a dual problem which has some nicer properties (even though both are convex), so you might want to look into that as well.\n\n\nI hope this helps and please do not be afraid of the complex concepts, it's not that bad once you have a hold of the basics (Linear Algebra, Optimization, maybe some Functional Analysis)! Good resources on the topic include sklearns documentation on the topic, as well as the relevant chapter from \"Elements of Statistical Learning\".\n\n\nIt's excellent that you're obsessed with the details and fully grasping everything, please never change that!",

That doesn’t require a deep understanding of AI imo.

Try to solve a problem with ML instead of focusing on the individual elements. \n\n\nSo make a dataset, annotate it, train a model (yolo is fun), do a couple revisions, then try a test deployment with QC. This process will teach you more about ML than an in depth analysis of the math. \n\n\nEssentially all models are data limited. Even the large LLMs now! This means the math can accommodate more data but we have none to give. So the math and model aren't limiting its how fast you can collect and annotate data. This has to be done in the real so is slow, costly and painful. \n\n\nIf I could buy 100 engineers 80 would be dataset collectors / annotaters / QC, 10, would be pipeline and infrastructure, 5 would be deployment, 5 would be model development. A major change in model can be revolutionary,  see transformers, but this is a Longshot once a decade thing. For a product brute force with off the shelf tools is usually the answer. ",

I sat through an academic talk recently where the speaker was saying that ML is transitioning into a “stage 3” development, where he defined “stage 1” as being foundational where people are all coming up with their own architectures, “stage 2” as being applied where there is a consensus on what architectures to be used (e.g. transformer based architectures) but individual groups would all be training their own models, to stage 3 where it makes the most sense to simply take a trained model (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) and then either fine-tune it or just use it as a tool on its own rather than trying to train it yourself. There is an analogy with the simulation tools used in physics and engineering like COMSOL or Ansys (if you are familiar with those). People used to write their own simulation code, but now it makes the most sense to just buy a license for existing supported frameworks. Circling back to your original question, does it make sense to understand the inner workings of ML models & architectures? Maybe not in your case, however personally I have always found it advantageous to understand what’s going on “under the hood” when troubleshooting things, in the same way that one can be a better software engineer if they also understand some of the computer architecture/hardware that is actually driving the whole process.",

Gradient descent is a one-step method, and you’d learn it and study as at most a lecture (typically less) of an optimization course. Then, there’s the question of its convergence, which one can formally derive conditions, but some of the most important ones is you need to start from a basin, gradient magnitude in your metric being >1, stuff like that. I think these ideas are important to just know as part of the basis of your understanding, since “ML” really is just statistical learning and numerical optimization methods and you can’t get around that, but they shouldn’t really be intimidating. Take the time and learn things is my advice lol\n\n\nThat said, if by “AI engineering” you mean stuff like those “AI startups” that use the APIs for making apps, then no, your time is way better spent learning the development of the software, the infrastructure tools, deployment, streaming, databases (VDBs, nSQL, SQL and the APIs)/ORMs,  RAG etc. But at that point, don’t start telling yourself you’re doing “ML”, as you’d be a full-stack software engineer using LLM APIs (and nothings wrong with that!) :)",

Most jumps I’ve seen happen by building scrappy end to end stuff on your own, even simple APIs, basic logging, retraining scripts, and breaking them on purpose to see what fails. Courses help with concepts but they usually skip the ugly production bits. One thing that helps is checking ML engineer interview expectations since they force you to think about deployment and monitoring, and some [ML engineer guides](https://www.interviewquery.com/learning-paths/modeling-and-machine-learning-interview) and questions are decent for that without being overwhelming.",

What helped me most wasn’t courses alone, but building small end-to-end projects myself—serving a model, adding logs, handling failures, and seeing what breaks in the real world. Courses are useful for structure, but they rarely cover the messy production realities.

Long-term I’m interested in research (papers, maybe MS later), but in the short term I also want to be industry-relevant and understand how ML is actually used in real systems.\n\nI keep hearing that ML is best learned alongside strong fundamentals (math + theory) and by reading papers, but as a beginner it’s confusing to know where to start, what to ignore, and how deep to go. I’ve seen resources on Coursera/Udemy/YouTube/Kaggle, but I don’t want to just follow random tutorials or hype — I want a structured foundation.\n\nA few things I’m unsure about:\n\nShould I start with theory first (math, basics) or applications/projects?\n\nHow early should I start reading research papers, and how do you read them effectively as a beginner?\n\nWhat skills matter if I want to keep both research and industry ML paths open?\n\nCommon mistakes beginners make that I should avoid?\n\nI’ve also seen some people say that the “traditional path” (math-heavy + classic ML) is losing value because of LLMs/GenAI. I’ve also been curious about agentic AI and applied LLMs and wanted to learn that too for a while but where do they fit in for a beginner?\n\nWould appreciate guidance from people who are working in ML/research or have been through this path.

          "text": "with respect to papers, I’d say once you’ve gotten a fundamental grasp of and intuition for neural network optimization (and hopefully you’re reasonably familiar with linear algebra), then start reading some fundamental works of the past 10 years (CNN paper, autoencoders etc. are good places to start). I would recommend staying put in the supervised learning space for a while. \n\nInevitably you will not understand everything on these first read-throughs. That simply has to be accepted. It’s a tough balance, but you have to manage being confused about the details while also trying to extract intuitions. My recommendation is to occasionally try to map out a matrix-equation present in these papers using pen and paper (understanding the dimensions of each variable, what information is being passed and how). This should also be done for the neural net fundamentals (mapping forward passes, backpropagation, partial derivatives, etc.). \n\nIf you would like to then tow the line between LLM-applicable knowledge and ML theory, learn about autoregressive sequence to sequence models, then focus on the attention is all you need paper. Early NLP stuff in general. You can also generally push out to more advanced versions of the previous fundamental architectures (generative adversarial networks, variations autoencoders, and so on). \n\nAfter this kind of learning, you will notice that reading ML papers should be now much more accessible, though the confusion will likely still be there as most of these concepts are considered pre-requisite knowledge that the authors will assume you have. \n\nHopefully this helps. Not the only way, just closer to how I did it. Remember no pursuit of knowledge is ever a waste of time, and inevitably in retrospect you will realize that such and such would have been better to learn before some other thing and so on. What’s important is that you learned it at all. You have a lot of time to do this, so don’t get too caught up in the paralysis of starting ‘the right way’. Good luck!",

Later, I switched roles to become an Infrastructure Engineer, where I gained exposure to MLOps through the team I worked with this year. I was assigned to set up monitoring for ML models, training pipelines, focusing on performance and efficiency. \n\nI attended a few bootcamps to quickly grasp the basics of how things work, but they didn’t really address the “why” behind the concepts. That’s when I decided to go back to fundamentals and brush up on my mathematics. Since statistics wasn’t part of my original background, I chose to start from scratch. It’s been almost two months now, and I already see a different perspective compared to when I was first exposed to this field.",

Well, for example, if you need to build your own deep learning models in Pytorch, you'll need to understand class inheritance and composition. Also, most codebases you'll end up contributing to will require that you understand classes, abstract classes, enums, data classes, and, increasingly, pydantic models.\n\nAdditionally, and this may be a little anecdotal, a lot of people applying for AIML jobs in the past two years or so are clearly trying to jump on the AI hype train without any deeper interest. Consequently, they do not develop sufficient expertise, because people underestimate how much math they'll need. What I'm trying to say is, your recruiting manager will likely have seen many people like that, so you'll benefit from coming across as someone who has a strong interest in AIML, beyond just thinking that ChatGPT is cool. You can demonstrate this by being able to have a conversation about AIML topics, complete with the tradeoffs of different approaches and an ability to explain your choices (no, \"I used this approach because it's the best one,\" and crickets).\n\nGood luck!",

Instead, look for a \"work-adjacent\" problem—like a manual data task or a repetitive bug-triage process at your current job—and try to build a small AI-based solution for it. Solving a real-world business problem with \"messy\" internal data is worth 10x more to a hiring manager than any generic tutorial project.\n\nI’ve been a self-learner for most of my 10+ years in AI (currently a Sr. Applied Scientist in Big Tech).

It uses manual backpropagation with a gradient check in the notebook.\n\nI built this to help myself visualize the gears of the architecture of a language model, and I hope it can be a useful reference for others too.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/dbrll/BareGPT\n\nI'd love to get your feedback on the implementation.",

The gradients are computed in `engine.backward_attention` using matrix multiplications which implicitly handle the Jacobian-vector products. \n\nThat part was by far the toughest to debug...

(Notebooks, GitHub projects, any platforms?)\n* What's frustrating about the current options?\n* Would you care about optimizing your implementations (speed, memory, numerical stability) or is \"it works\" good enough?\n\nBuilding something in this space and trying to understand if this is even a real need.

      "text": "I am not really sure how to write this post. My first job was a dead-end data scientist job where I worked in a fintech startup and used python/sql to do a mix of:\n\n1. Managing quantitative finance products\n2. Not-that-useful-for-business-value unsupervised machine learning models that were run manually on an AWS compute instance with no MLOps\n3. Data pipelines for tableau dashboards/daily email reports\n4. Ad-hoc business analysis in notebooks\n\nIn my next job (with about a year of unemployment after the last one) I worked as a data scientist, but mostly did data engineering work and left after 6 months:\n\n1. Postgres and Airflow backend development\n2. Simple statistical models for analytics with SQL that were calculated in a tumbling-window\n\nI have always wanted to get a proper job in machine learning engineering, and I have some of the skills required (LLMs, simple neural networks/traditional ml, infrastructure, working with data, data engineering, MLOps system design, CI/CD) but don't have the advanced skills required for this job (eg: reinforcement learning, computer vision, GPU infrastructure, recommendation, forecasting, robotics/embedded systems) and the market for MLE/DS jobs is incredibly competitive.\n\nI have come to realize that **my work experience/education is inadequate to compete with other candidates in the incredibly competitive and high-compensation DS/MLE job market**. So, now I am trying to pivot to a full-stack AI engineer role where there is a greater emphasis on front-end and back-end web application development while having the responsibilities of an AI engineer to use existing models (Eg: LLMs, Multimodal models, Hugging face, fine-tuning) to design and create AI features.\n\nMy definition of MLE/AIE being:\n\n* MLE: Engineers who build their own models, create algorithms/advanced ML strategies to address business problems, have a strong academic background\n* AIE: Engineers who use existing foundation models to set up AI workflows, do not use advanced ML strategies (RL, CV, etc...) or develop algorithms, do not have a strong academic background\n\nI am simply unable to compete with others to get a pure ML/AI role, so my plan is to become a full-stack AI engineer so as to utilize my existing engineering skills (while learning more front-end), while not entirely wasting my skills in ML/AI. The academic requirements for a full-stack web dev position are lower, and this job market has more positions than ML/AI (albeit lower salary, but I just want to continue my career), so I think this is the best course of action I can take right now.\n\nIn order to a job like that, I am trying to position myself as a full-stack engineer **who is willing to understand the product/business and knows how to use AI models to design features in to can create tangible value for the company**. This might be a tall order, but it's the best plan I have right now to revive my career which has been slowly dying, and I am open to any ideas/suggestions that may help. Thank you in advance.\n\nI am currently working on a project that will hopefully get me considered for AI/full-stack engineer jobs. It is a multi-agent system that integrates with a hypothetical CRM system to responds to customer support emails by understanding the content of the email, categorising it into an appropriate action category (e.g., escalate, flag, response, etc), and taking whatever actions are necessary (e.g., checking transactions/claims/statuses, etc...) to address the support request in that category. Then the agent prepares a response to the email with a list of actions taken and contextual data gathered from internal systems, for staff to manually review before sending it to the client. This interface for staff is accessible through an authenticated front-end which displays the details of the customer support case, the actions taken by the agent, and the email response that the agent has prepared.",

You can already make a difference to others candidates just by providing a functional project usable by the business as a demo. Which is rare, since the educational scope are not into building app at the top the trained model to fully generate value from it. \n\nYou can also check at Streamlit if you want faster app building for proof of concept",

      "text": "I’m a recent bachelor's grad from a top CS school and I majored in data science. I applied to some master’s programs because it makes sense for the data science industry. Currently I’m working as a data scientist. \n\nI'm very lucky to have gotten into UPenn’s data science master’s program and GT OMSCS, both are online and part time, but I’m torn between the two. The main reason why I’m hesitant about penn is because some people have told me that a CS master’s would be more complementary to my DS bachelors degree. My manager mentioned that it would be beneficial to learn how to write production code and be able to deploy models, and these are skills I might be able to get with a CS masters.\n\nAnother hesitation I have is that UPenn's curriculum appears to overlap (around 30–40%) with courses I took at my undergrad, but I can also see value in refreshing my memory on those topics. On the pro side, UPenn’s reputation is slightly higher than GT in general (not in tech). I’m not 100% sure if I want to stay in tech, so I feel like going for the more prestigious school would be a safer option. Penn only costs 20k for me after employer reimbursement, and my WLB would not be killed because the curriculum is less rigorous than OMSCS.\n\nI personally did not like the data structures class at my undergrad, so I have a feeling that I probably don’t like CS/SWE very much. However, I have heard about DS jobs turning into MLE or data analyst jobs, so I might need CS skills to prepare for the transition to an more senior MLE job. Given all of this, I would really value your perspective. For someone who plans to stay primarily in the data science field, which program would you say is the better choice? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

Some do, not sure about UPenn, only briefly looked at it online. I do know some people who have done some ML courses at the GT program and found it helpful. A current coworker of mine attends the part time online for this program. We work as MLE’s and they say it does cover lots of the basics. \n\nI always think it’s good for MLE’s to be able to understand production level code even if you do not want to be a SWE. GT would be beneficial for this and would also bring in some new concepts that are potentially valuable as DS / MLE. From what I hear the program is kinda what you make of it. If you have no interest at all in software stick to UPenn though. From my experience lots of roles in ML lately seem to require a strong foundations of DS + ML + CS. \n\nI would say GT based on what my colleagues and friends have said. It is also a very well known and respected program. Either way both are great and congrats on your acceptances!",

              "text": "Thank you so much for your advice! \n\nI would say that my current job requires me to do a lot of ML modeling to gain business insights, but not to productionize the model. I really enjoy building complex models and neural networks, but I’m not really sure if I want to move towards a more MLE oriented role, because I heard that it’s more about being a SWE than a data scientist. I had a really miserable experience taking the data structures and algorithms class at my undergrad. I was literally crying before every exam lol, but I’m not sure if it was because I just dislike computers or that class was just too hard and overwhelming (everybody found it really hard). What I know I didn’t like was not having any free time and coding all day. I understand a CS degree might keep more doors open, but I’m not sure if I’m willing to make that sacrifice in time and mental health 😭\n\nI think my main goal with this master’s program is to check off the box when applying to new ds jobs, since they all seem to require one these days. Of course I want to learn new things too, but I’m also afraid of burning out and potentially have this negatively impact my performance at work, especially since I just started working at this company. I think a workload difference of 5+ hours per week is still significant especially when it’s over 3-4 years. \n\nSince I’m not really excited by software, I was thinking maybe I can do UPenn first, then enroll in OMSCS for some extra learning but not necessarily to graduate. Would you say this plan can also help me keep my doors open for ML roles, if I do end up wanting to transfer in the future?",

They are used infrequently, most of SWE looks drastically different, but completely understandable for those courses to leave a bad taste!\n\nAs for checking a box, think the UPenn seems to certainly better fit your goals then. However I do find it rare for a data science undergrad and grad graduate to become SWE / MLE oriented roles (though not unheard of) just not very typically. Data science and software skills are very different, which is usually why a degree would be a way for you to build those skills. I don’t think UPenn closes that door to pivot but GT program would certainly make it easier for you to pivot down the line. Both will certainly help though!",

When you start practicing interview stuff it helps to do actual coding problems with feedback, check out [interview questions](https://www.interviewquery.com/questions?searchQuery=&searchQuestionTag=&searchCompany=&positions=data-analyst&positions=data-scientist&completed=&saved=&ordering=relevancy&orderingDirection=asc&pageSize=20&page=0), and do mock interview tools that make sure you can explain your ML/AI code and concepts out loud, not just know them in theory.",

I can code. That’s not the issue.\n\nThe real problem is income.\n\nBecause I’m not earning properly yet, I can’t focus deeply on ML all day.

But trying to do everything while earning nothing just freezes me.\n\nSo I’m confused between:\n\n* Doubling down on ML and freelancing\n* Switching to Web Dev for faster money\n* Or learning everything slowly and hoping something clicks ??\n\nThanks 🙏",

Your current education and/or occupation? \n\nIts clear that you have some interests in the very broad areas of ML, Web Development and Cybersecurity but besides that, there isn't a lot of context for anyone to give tailored advice. \n\nYou mentioned coding isn't an issue, so you have experience in that field, do you have any opportunties to get employment in any of those three areas? Whats your background in mathematics? Strengthening your knowledge in Discrete Mathematics will be a great ROI for both ML and Cybersecurity. \n\nFrom what I know, and based on my limited experience (which may be different from others who comment on here) the best short term path would be to get meaningful employment in one of the three areas now, and take courses (either self learning through courses like Coursera or through formal education such as a Grad Cert) to get formal qualifications in another field if you are more passionate about it (e.g get a Web dev role now, and study ML part time later if you find that is your \"true calling\") \n\nI just think when asking for opinions for a topic like this, where tailored advice based on your situation is important,  it could be beneficial to add more details on your current experience.",

It has reduced the barrier of entry to Web Development.\n\nDoes this mean that Web developers are no longer useful? No. Does it mean they can make Web applications of higher quality and reliability then you can? Probably not. But what it does mean, is that freelancers in Web development have less clients for 2 reasons. 1) more CS graduates (and really anyone) feel empowered to become Web developers and 2) people that would have been potential clients are now using these tools to build their own applications. \n\nWith ML and Cybersecurity, usually formal education is valued unless you have a very good reason for them to look past it. Whether this is through self driven projects or work placements. Getting a good data entry/ junior data science internship/graduate position could be a good start for ML, whereas security consulting could be a good start to Cybersecurity but it will most likely need to wait until after you have completed your undergraduate degree to join a graduate program.\n\nIf getting into Cybersecurity,  there are certs you could benefit from getting (but there can be costs to doing so, make sure you are commited to Cybersecurity before investing in this) such as CompTIA certs or ISC2 \n\nFor now, I would say focus on your degree, and apply for entry roles in the areas that interests you. Unless an opportunity presents itself your formal education or a job placement will have the most impact in entering the field. Of course do not dismiss your self-learning , as you will benefit from this in the long term.",

I tried to keep the code very simple and beginner-friendly, focusing on understanding the *Attention Is All You Need* paper rather than optimization or using high-level libraries. Before this, I’ve covered classical ML and deep learning (CNNs, RNNs). After working through Transformers, I’ve become interested in AI/ML infrastructure, especially inference-side topics like attention internals, KV cache, and systems such as vLLM. I wanted to ask if moving toward AI infrastructure makes sense at this stage, or if I should spend more time building and experimenting with models first. I’ve shared my implementation here for feedback: [**https://github.com/Ryuzaki21/transformer-from-scratch**](https://github.com/Ryuzaki21/transformer-from-scratch). Any advice would be really appreciated",

Infrastructure work benefits a lot from having built models yourself, because concepts like KV cache or batching tradeoffs feel much more concrete once you have wrestled with attention math and shapes. You do not need to choose one forever either. A good middle ground is to take a simple model you understand and then focus on how inference changes when you care about latency, memory, and throughput. That way you are still grounded in modeling, but you are asking systems questions instead of architectural ones. A lot of strong infra folks followed a similar path, curiosity about why things get slow or expensive usually pulls you there naturally.",
