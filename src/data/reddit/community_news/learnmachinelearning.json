Polars: If your data is 10GB-100GB. It’s faster, handles memory better, and you don't need a cluster.\n3. Apache Spark: If you have Terabytes of data or need distributed computing across multiple machines.\n\nDon't optimize prematurely. You aren't \"less of an ML Engineer\" because you used Pandas for a 500MB dataset. You're just being efficient.\n\nIf you’re wondering when Spark actually makes sense in production, this guide breaks down real-world use cases, performance trade-offs, and where Spark genuinely adds value: [**Apache Spark**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/apache-spark) \n\nDoes anyone else feel like \"Big Data\" tools are over-pushed to beginners?",

They gave me a case for voice recignition to detect a word like „hello“ in a 10 second audio.\n\nI recommended to use a cnn. I said for a starting point to collect data we would need around 200 speakers. \n\nThey told me in the interview a cnn is overkill and they expected me to say RNN. And said for a rnn you only need a few collegues like 20 max? I dont believe this is true.

If you want to go back even earlier, they were doing Dynamic Time Warping -- big emphasis on feature engineering. RNNs (LSTMs) were the gold standard until the mid-2010s, when big tech companies decided they wanted home assistants (Alexa, Siri, ...) to be a thing. Interestingly, Rabiner (HMM guy), Bengio (RNN guy), and LeCun (CNN guy) were all at Bell Labs around the same time (mostly late 80s/early 90s), with the latter two in a different department than Rabiner. All three have reasonably distinct schools of thought on the problem, but my understanding was that, post-\"The Best RNN is a CNN\", most have moved over to CNNs. Google has a bunch of good papers on this stuff, relating to keyword spotting (Sainath et al., 2015 is a good one to look at if you're interested). \n\nAs it turns out, spatial invariance with respect to spectrograms makes CNNs superior for detecting fixed patterns (think: LeCun). RNNs have many downsides; I'm sure you're aware of them. As others have said, with so little data, the model would almost certainly overfit. There's definitely some nuance (you can train an RNN on very small data sequences if you're very careful... robustness might be questionable). You can also do a lot of interesting feature extraction and data augmentation to enable small RNNs and the likes. So I would strongly argue it is possible with hard limitations. But if you can do that, just use a CNN. Maybe the interviewer wanted latency discussions? In the context of embedded devices, CNNs are still generally lighter than RNNs, unless the use case is something along the lines of streaming.",

Wanted to share a lesson I learned the hard way about embedding-based matching  might save someone else the same mistake.\n\n**The approach**: Embed user profiles via LLM into 1536-dim vectors, store in Pinecone, query with ANN + metadata filters. Sub-200ms, scales well, semantically smart — \"loves hiking\" matches \"outdoor enthusiast\" automatically.\n\n**What went wrong**: 22% mutual acceptance rate. I audited the rejected high-scoring matches and found this:\n\n    User A: \"Career-focused lawyer, wants kids in 2 years, monogamy essential\"\n    User B: \"Career-focused consultant, never wants kids, open relationship\"\n    \n    Cosine similarity: 0.91\n    Reality: incompatible on two dealbreakers\n    \n\nEmbeddings captured *how someone describes their life*, tone, topic, semantic texture. They completely missed *what someone actually needs*, the structured preferences buried in the prose.\n\nThis wasn't an edge case. It was the dominant failure mode. High similarity, fundamental incompatibility. Two people who sounded alike but wanted completely different things.\n\n**The lesson**: Embedding similarity is necessary but not sufficient for compatibility. If your domain has dealbreakers, hard constraints where incompatibility on a single dimension overrides overall similarity, you need structured signal extraction on top.\n\n**What I did instead** (brief summary):\n\n1. Extracted 26 structured features from natural AI conversations (not surveys, 30% survey completion vs 85% conversational extraction)\n2. Built distance matrices: nuanced compatibility scores (0.0-1.0) instead of binary match/no-match\n3. Added hard filters: 4 dealbreaker features that reject pairs before scoring, zero exceptions\n4. Combined signals: `0.25 × text + 0.15 × visual + 0.60 × features`\n\n22% to 35% with this. Two more stages (personalized weights + bidirectional matching) took it to 68%.\n\nThis generalizes beyond dating; job matching (remote vs on-site is a dealbreaker regardless of skill similarity), marketplace matching (budget overrides preference), probably others.\n\nHas anyone else hit this wall with embeddings? Curious how others handle the structured-vs-semantic tradeoff.\n\nEdit:\nI know how training a biencoder on pairwise data would help, but mining hard negatives in such cases becomes a key challenge and also loses bidirectional non equivalence of liking one another ",

Then we used this summary (which kept updating), we used off the shelf pretrained embeddings to start with to do initial filtering of users for finding suitable match (not the best of the methods I agree) but thats where we started",

You outlined a few of these things like data acquisition, data cleaning, and data integrity. There are many more such things. Some of these things are areas of study in and of themselves.\n\nBeing quite specific, Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence which is a subfield of Computer Science, primarily. Its principal concern is with the development of statistical algorithms that can learn from known data and, ideally, generalize in some way onto unknown data. This is why good data and well-defined problems are so important.\n\nWith this in min, you need to be specific with yourself about what you are trying to learn because “learning ML” is a statement so broad that it’s useless. Focus on a specific algorithm or idea. Even after you’ve “learned it,” there is still the question of implementation. How low-level (or not) do you want to go? What is your goal?\n\nThis is not a thing to be “grokked.”",

But this is intuition you get from modeling clean datasets. It’s a skill you get over time, you’ll get better at knowing what your data should look like.\n\n\\- The confusion is fair. ML is an ocean of a field. Many topics and models, and a lot of depth for each topic. Start with linear regression. Then go to decision trees, KNN, bagging. Don’t go straight into neural nets. Walk before you run.\n\n\\- ML did not click for me until grad school tbh. It really started when I built a model from scratch (which is difficult but invaluable). And also formal comparison of different models with the same task.\n\n\\- My understanding of ML is not uniform. I’m solid with supervised, decent with NLP/neural nets and transformers. But stuff like reinforcement and clustering I really only get the gist of. \n\n\\- Role/title: in the short term, look at the actual descriptions, much of these overlap. One co’s data scientist is another’s data analyst. \n\nLong term, once you get deeper into learning, you’ll realize what parts you enjoy more than others. You’ll know what you want eventually",

If you skip fundamentals, everything feels like magic, and if you go too deep into math without context, it feels disconnected.\nStart with Python,but only what you actually need - core Python, Numpy for arrays and linear algebra, and Pandas for basic data handling - don't try to memorize everything.\n\n\nMaths isn't optional,but you don't need long derivations. What helps is working with small units (2x2 matrices, simple vectors), doing operations by hand once, asking what they do to data, and why they matter, then implementing them in a few lines of   Numpy(or pure python) and using intuition-building resources like 3blue1brown.\n\n\nCopying notebooks is fine at first, but real learning starts when you break things, tweak parameters, and try to rebuild models on your own and get stuck - that stuck feeling is a signal, not failure. Real data is messy because real ml is messy, which is why beginner projects like Titanic or House prices still matter: they teach you the actual lifecycle (data -> preprocessing -> feature engineering -> training -> evaluation -> tuning as a loop) and how small changes affect outcomes. \n\n\nMost people start in Jupyter, and that's okay, but after a few projects you should move toward modular code, functions and folders - that's where ML starts to feel real.\n\n\nNot knowing whether you want to be an ML engineer, data scientist, researcher or GenAI engineer is normal too, clarity comes after building and breaking things, not before. ML doesn't click all at once - it clicks in fragments overtime and if you feel lost and still curious, you are exactly where you should be.",

I end up jumping between resources to fill gaps and lose a clear sense of progression.\n\n**Background:** Bachelor’s degree; some linear algebra & calculus (needs review); basic/intermediate Python.\n\n**Goal:**\n\nAt minimum, stay on a correct learning path and accumulate skills steadily.\n\nLong-term, build a strong foundation and the ability to implement/diagnose models independently.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. When does it make sense to read papers, and how do you avoid getting lost in prerequisites?\n2. What “must-have” fundamentals should come before reading modern deep learning papers?\n3. Top-down (papers → fill gaps) vs bottom-up (fundamentals → models → papers): which works better, and what milestone sequence would you recommend?\n4. What practice routine forces real understanding (e.g., implementations, reproductions, projects)?\n\nNot looking for a huge link dump—just a practical roadmap and milestones.\n\nThanks!",

          "text": "Bottom-up always or you will be lost in the sauce. Here is what I’d suggest.\n\nYou need to start in the metaphorical basement: linear algebra (at least understanding the topics covered by a typical college course, and maybe some extras - critical concepts include vector spaces and their properties, matrix manipulation / multiplication and matrix properties, linear transformations and their properties), calculus (limits, differentiation, integration, multi-variable calculus should be sufficient for basics), and maybe most importantly probability + statistics (understanding probability spaces, I.e., how do we define them, random variables, random vectors, functions of random variables, stochastic processes, etc.) I would also strongly recommend studying statistical estimation and detection - the theory underpins fundamental problems tackled by ML. Also, understanding some optimization theory would be useful (e.g., convex optimization, KKT, etc.).\n\nThen you can move onto an ML intro course’s content: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, basic optimization if not already learned (GD and SGD), multi-layer perceptrons (simple NNs), etc. There are of course more “intro” concepts, but I think these would give you a strong foundation.\n\nFrom here, you should dive into more advanced topics that interest you. I would advise avoiding papers until you have a very high mathematical maturity level and truly understand fundamental concepts. Most papers (or their key concepts) can be found described in blog posts that are easier to digest.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I would strongly suggest pursuing an MS or a PhD if you are serious about getting into ML. Self-learning ML is much more difficult than just learning to code. Coding is a part of the job of course, but it is the easiest part (at least for researchers).",

Once you have discovered a problem you can ask whatever LLM you prefer a structured a roadmap of what you should know to tackle the problem using ML from basics. From there you learn + build simultaneously whether its by reading up on an algorithm or seeing how others have implemented it in code etc. \n\nFor example, if you have to use linear regression at some point just knowing what is it about the fundamental nature of linear regression that helps solve this problem can help you master certain commonly used ML algorithms\n\nAlthough i would say before u build something serious u should have a good grasp on the mathematics especially linear algebra. im currently studying it from this book https://mml-book.github.io which has been recommended a lot in this subreddit.

But does every token really need to \"think\" deeply?\n\nI built a sparse-update architecture based on a simple intuition:\n\n1. **Divide & Conquer**: Split tokens into **Workers** (every 4th token) and **Memory** (the rest).\n2. **Workers**: Do the heavy lifting (Full Attention + FFN).\n3. **Memory**: Only do a cheap depthwise conv1d to capture local context (like Mamba/ConvNets) but **skip** the heavy Transformer block.\n4. **In-place Update**: Everything happens in-place. No extra tokens added, no sequence inflation.\n\n**The Result (on T=1024 sequence length):**\n\nI ran a \"battle\" between a Standard Transformer and my WorkerTransformer (same params, layers, dim) on a fixed 5-minute training budget.\n\n* **Standard Transformer**: 3.2 steps/s | Reached Val Loss **1.44**\n* **WorkerTransformer**: 8.0 steps/s (**2.5x speedup**) | Reached Val Loss **1.30**\n\nThe \"lazy\" model didn't just run faster; because it ran 2.5x more steps in the same timeframe, it actually learned **more** and achieved a significantly lower loss. It seems the trade-off of \"sparse compute vs. more iterations\" heavily favors sparse compute here.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:**\n\nI suspect this could scale. The architecture is **pure PyTorch** (no custom CUDA kernels needed), making it dead simple to modify.\n\nIf you have spare A100s or are looking for a weekend project, I'd love to see someone scale this up to WikiText-103 or RedPajama.\n\n**Code & Benchmarks:** [https://github.com/SuiltaPico/WorkerTransformer](https://github.com/SuiltaPico/WorkerTransformer)\n\nLet me know if you find any flaws in my reasoning or if you manage to break it!",

That made it easy to try both versions (including vs excluding trees) without committing too early.\n\nIt wasn’t perfect, but much faster. You just correct predictions where it matters and iterate. In the end it was easier to compare what the model actually learns and the labeling process got way smoother. Especially in early stages of learning how labelling affects learning, this may be a nice visualisation and hopefully learning.",
