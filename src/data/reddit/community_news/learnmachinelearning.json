      "text": "I'm a graduate student studying AI. currently doing my summer internship search and i need to get something off my chest because it's been building for weeks.\n\ntraditional ML is dead. like actually dead. and nobody told me before i spent two years learning it.\n\nI ground the fundamentals hard, bayesian statistics, linear algebra, probability theory, wrote backpropagation from scratch multiple times, spent months on regularization, optimization, the mathematical foundations of everything.\n\nI was proud of that. Felt like i actually understood what was happening inside models instead of just running library calls.\n\nThen i started looking at internship postings.\n\nevery single one, even the ones titled \"data science intern\" or \"ml research intern\" is asking for:\n\n[Langchain.com](https://www.langchain.com/) and [Heyneo.so](http://heyneo.so) for building pipelines, OpenAI API and Anthropic Claude for LLM integration, [pinecone.io](http://pinecone.io) or [weaviate.io](http://weaviate.io) for vector databases, Hugging Face for model access, LlamaIndex for RAG, fine-tuning experience, prompt engineering, evals.\n\nNot one posting mentioned bayesian inference. not one mentioned hypothesis testing. nobody cares about SVMs or classical regression or time series fundamentals. one job description literally listed \"vibe coding\" as a desirable skill for a data science internship. vibe coding.\n\nI understand the market has moved. companies are building LLM products. the tooling has shifted, I'm not saying that's wrong.\n\nBut it feels like two years of building mathematical foundations just became irrelevant overnight. the statistical intuition i built, the ability to read a paper and understand what's actually happening, the deep model understanding, nobody is asking for that in any posting i can find.\n\nso i'm going to spend my summer learning the tooling. Not because i want to, but because the market is clear about what it wants.\n\nJust needed to rant somewhere that people would understand. is anyone else dealing with this or did i just pick the wrong two years to learn the fundamentals?",

Something weird has happened in the last few years where increasingly the jobs are no longer about building tooling to facilitate business outcomes.

A big chunk of my pride as a worker has been building things that actually have real use cases and generally improve people's day-to-day operation. I'm seeing less and less of that on the table. \n\nJust to be clear, I don't think statistics or foundational work is irrelevant, but if people aren't making products with those skills in our field, then it's time to find a place where those skills are still useful.",

That’s mainly because once you backtest your model in Quant you want it to do exactly what it was trained on, ie no hallucinations that could blow up your account. I’m sure LLM still has its place but the traditional ML is still very much not dead. \n\nNow I cannot speak to other fields as I don’t work in them, but the logic still applies. Gotta find niche roles where the demand for non LLM models is high. They’re out there if you look.",

But when 100 users started using it, the costs increased dramatically. Ironically, the same problem could have been solved using Bayesian inference at a fraction of the cost without that running out of context problem. \n\nTraditional machine learning is still highly relevant, even if it isn’t as hyped. If a problem can be solved with statistical ML methods, organizations will often prefer them, maybe not today but in the long run because they are significantly cheaper than LLM-based solutions.",

The answer is always a resounding \"No, PyTorch won, move on.\"\n\nBut if you actually look at what the Fortune 500 is hiring for, TensorFlow is essentially the Zombie King of ML. It’s not \"winning\" in terms of hype or GitHub stars, but it’s completely entrenched.\n\nI think we’re falling into a \"Research vs. Reality\" trap.\n\nLook at academia; PyTorch has basically flatlined TF. If you’re writing a paper today in TensorFlow, you’re almost hurting your own citation count.\n\nThere’s also the Mobile/Edge factor. Everyone loves to hate on TF, but TF Lite still has a massive grip on mobile deployment that PyTorch is only just starting to squeeze. If you’re deploying to a billion Android devices, TF is often still the \"safe\" default.\n\nThe Verdict for 2026: If you’re building a GenAI startup or doing research, obviously use PyTorch. Nobody is writing a new LLM in raw TensorFlow today.\n\nIf you’re stuck between the “PyTorch won” crowd and the “TF pays the bills” reality, this breakdown is actually worth a read: [**PyTorch vs TensorFlow**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-enterprise-guide)\n\nIf you want to build cool stuff, learn PyTorch. If you want a stable, high-paying job maintaining legacy fraud detection models for a bank, you better know your way around a Graph.\n\nAm I wrong here? Is anyone actually seeing new enterprise projects starting in TF today, or are we officially in \"Maintenance Only\" mode?",

Everyone posts the win, so here's the loss, and then the accidental win after.\n\nSpent about 8 months building ml side projects and I genuinely believed one of them would take off. None of them made a dollar. not a single transaction.\n\nhere's each one with the real numbers.\n\n***app 1: churn predictor for saas companies***\n\nI built it with fastapi for the backend, scikit-learn for the initial model, railway for hosting. took about 3 weeks.\n\nusers: 12 signups. 0 paid. 3 people actually uploaded data. the feedback i got was that they didn't trust a tool they found randomly online with their user data. fair.\n\nwhat killed it: i posted once on X, got 40 views, moved on. never figured out how to actually reach saas founders.\n\n***app 2: resume screener for small hiring teams***\n\nI built it with python, a basic nlp pipeline, claude api for the actual ranking logic, deployed on railway. took 2 weeks.\n\nusers: 31 signups. 0 paid. about 8 people tried it. feedback was that it felt risky to make hiring decisions with an ai tool they found on product hunt.\n\nwhat killed it: launched on product hunt on a tuesday. got 40 upvotes. disappeared. never figured out distribution at all.\n\n***app 3: customer segmentation tool***\n\nthe idea: give small e-commerce stores the kind of customer segmentation that big companies have.\n\nthis one i actually put more work into. used heyneo to handle the ml pipeline which made building it way faster. [heyneo.so](http://heyneo.so) dealt with the data preprocessing, model training and the output formatting. frontend was built with lovable. also deployed on railway. took about 3 weeks including testing.\n\nusers: 8 signups. 0 paid. 2 people actually ran a segmentation. one said it was cool but they didn't know what to do with the segments. that one stung because i thought the output was useful.\n\nwhat killed it: literally zero marketing. posted in one subreddit, got 3 upvotes, gave up too early.\n\n***app 4: content performance predictor***\n\nthe idea: paste your blog post or social content, get a score predicting how it'll perform based on patterns from high performing content.\n\nusers: 67 signups. 0 paid. most people used it once and left. the predictions were probably not accurate enough to be useful and i had no way to validate them.\n\nwhat killed it: product was probably not good enough honestly. this one might have deserved to die.\n\n**So I decided to test another way:** I was reading posts here and in freelance community and started noticing people getting ml clients through reddit. not posting their products but just being helpful in comments, answering questions, sharing knowledge. people would dm them asking for help.\n\ntried it. spent a few weeks just being useful in data science and ml subreddits. got my first dm about 3 weeks in. someone needed a customer segmentation model for their email campaigns.\n\nquoted them $2,200. they said yes.\n\ndelivered it in about 5 days using the same stack i'd used for app 3, neo for the ml pipeline, fastapi for the api layer, railway for deployment. client was happy. referred me to someone else.\n\nA second client came from that referral. $3,800 for a churn prediction model.\n\n**Made more in 6 weeks of freelancing than 8 months of trying to build products.**\n\nI currently have 3 active clients and a couple more in the pipeline. averaging somewhere around $8k to $10k per month now depending on the month. planning to go full time on this by end of year.\n\n**Current stack for freelance work:** **Heyneo** for ml pipeline automation, **fastapi** for api layer, **railway** for deployment, **perplexity** for research when i need to understand a new domain fast, claude for documentation and client communication drafts.\n\nhappy to answer questions about the freelancing side or the failed apps. also curious if anyone has actually figured out distribution for ml tools because i never did.",

Also, building a tool, without first knowing they’re solving a current and persistent problem that needs solving by a defined set of users who feel their problem is bad enough to pay for a solution, will usually fail immediately. \n\nI work in the IT industry but I’m building a tool now in the real estate industry. To ensure I’m building the right tool for the right target user, I went and became the target user. So I quit my high paying IT job and became a low paid real estate agent and worked there until I ran out of money. In that year I learnt all about the industry and validated my idea and flushed out the full development roadmap. \n\nThen went back to my IT job to work for a while to repay the crippling debt I racked up working as an agent because I didn’t have savings to actually take this action. Now the debt is paid off and a MVP is almost complete. I’m busy with the deployment environment now, so soon I should be able to launch. \n\nSeeing I made friends in the industry I already have a contact list of people to offer to try out the product and give feedback on the MVP. I’ll just offer it to a small subset of people first to prove my concept and polish the solution. Once I apply the recommendations from that feedback, then I can expand to more people in my contact list. \n\nEven with all this work over a few years I still don’t know if I’ll success. \n\nNotice my focus is more on what the solution is and who’s going to use it and not the tool itself? The stack I chose ended up being informed by the solution requirements more than my thoughts on cool tech. I barely know the stack and entirely use AI to build it. \n\nI dunno, Business is hard man. I think it’s mostly luck: right place at the right time and you just so happen to have learnt a stack of skills that are suddenly all applicable in that moment. \n\nSo keep trying, you may get lucky. But make your efforts informed by the paying target user more than just building cool stuff.",

      "text": "A few weeks ago, Jane Street released a set of ML puzzles through the Dwarkesh podcast. Track 2 gives you a neural network that's been disassembled into 97 pieces (shuffled layers) and asks you to put it back together. You know it's correct when the reassembled model produces MSE = 0 on the training data and a SHA256 hash matches.\n\n\n\nWe solved it yesterday using a home lab — no cloud GPUs, no corporate cluster. Here's what the journey looked like without spoiling the solution.\n\n\n\n\\## The Setup\n\n\n\nOur \"cluster\" is the Cherokee AI Federation — a 5-node home network:\n\n\n\n\\- 2 Linux servers (Threadripper 7960X + i9-13900K, both with NVIDIA GPUs)\n\n\\- 2 Mac Studios (M1 Max 64GB each)\n\n\\- 1 MacBook Pro (M4 Max 128GB)\n\n\\- PostgreSQL on the network for shared state\n\n\n\nTotal cost of compute: electricity. We already had the hardware.\n\n\n\n\\## The Journey (3 days)\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Day 1-2: Distributed Simulated Annealing\\*\\*\n\n\n\nWe started where most people probably start — treating it as a combinatorial optimization problem. We wrote a distributed SA worker that runs on all 5 nodes, sharing elite solutions through a PostgreSQL pool with genetic crossover (PMX for permutations).\n\n\n\nThis drove MSE from \\~0.45 down to 0.00275. Then it got stuck. 172 solutions in the pool, all converged to the same local minimum. Every node grinding, no progress.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Day 3 Morning: The Basin-Breaking Insight\\*\\*\n\n\n\nInstead of running more SA, we asked a different question: \\*where do our 172 solutions disagree?\\*\n\n\n\nWe analyzed the top-50 pool solutions position by position. Most positions had unanimous agreement — those were probably correct. But a handful of positions showed real disagreement across solutions. We enumerated all valid permutations at just those uncertain positions.\n\n\n\nThis broke the basin immediately. MSE dropped from 0.00275 to 0.002, then iterative consensus refinement drove it to 0.00173.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Day 3 Afternoon: The Endgame\\*\\*\n\n\n\nFrom 0.00173 we built an endgame solver with increasingly aggressive move types:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Pairwise swap cascade\\*\\* — test all C(n,2) swaps, greedily apply non-overlapping improvements. Two rounds of this: 0.00173 → 0.000584 → 0.000253\n\n2. \\*\\*3-opt rotations\\*\\* — test all C(n,3) three-way rotations in both directions\n\n\n\nThe 3-opt phase is where it cracked open. Three consecutive 3-way rotations, each one dropping MSE by \\~40%, and the last one hit exactly zero. Hash matched.\n\n\n\n\\## The Key Insight\n\n\n\nThe reason SA got stuck is that the remaining errors lived in positions that required \\*\\*simultaneous multi-element moves\\*\\*. Think of it like a combination lock where three pins need to turn at exactly the same time — testing any single pin makes things worse.\n\n\n\nPairwise swaps can't find these. SA proposes single swaps. You need to systematically test coordinated 3-way moves to find them. Once we added 3-opt to the move vocabulary, it solved in seconds.\n\n\n\n\\## What Surprised Us\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Apple Silicon dominated.\\*\\* The M4 Max was 2.5x faster per-thread than our Threadripper on CPU-bound numpy. The final solve happened on the MacBook Pro.\n\n\\- \\*\\*Consensus analysis > more compute.\\*\\* Analyzing \\*where solutions disagree\\* was worth more than 10x the SA fleet time.\n\n\\- \\*\\*The puzzle has fractal structure.\\*\\* Coarse optimization (SA) solves 90% of positions. Medium optimization (swap cascades) solves the next 8%. The last 2% requires coordinated multi-block moves that no stochastic method will find in reasonable time.\n\n\\- \\*\\*47 seconds.\\*\\* The endgame solver found the solution in 47 seconds on the M4 Max. After 2 days of distributed SA across 5 machines. The right algorithm matters more than the right hardware.\n\n\n\n\\## Tech Stack\n\n\n\n\\- Python (torch, numpy, scipy)\n\n\\- PostgreSQL for distributed solution pool\n\n\\- No frameworks, no ML training, pure combinatorial optimization\n\n\\- Scripts: \\~4,500 lines across 15 solvers\n\n\n\n\\## Acknowledgment\n\n\n\nBuilt by the Cherokee AI Federation — a tribal AI sovereignty project. We're not a quant shop. We just like hard puzzles.\n\n",

      "text": "I've tasked Claude to scrape the dataset of Ycombinator companies currently hiring and try to find patterns, skills and tools that are most in demand for machine learning and AI jobs at these companies. \n\nThe dataset is clearly skewed towards the type of companies Ycombinator selects, which are currently very LLM/agent optimistic; on the other hand, these are very nimble and fast moving companies, and some of them could soon disrupt major players that are looking for other skills - so those more traditional roles and approaches might become harder to find in a few months or years. \n\nIn no way should this be seen as an attack against traditional ML approaches, data science and frontier model work; it's just a little data point for those with bills to pay and looking to dip their feet in this market. I found it interesting and share it here, maybe others will too. 100% LLM generated content follows after the line.\n\n\n_____________\n\n  Based on reading the 625 scraped jobs from WorkAtAStartup, here's my take:                                                                                                                                             \n  The Big Picture: Traditional ML Is Dead in Startup Land                                                                                                                                                                                    \n  The most striking finding is how completely LLM/agentic skills have displaced classical ML. Out of 37 jobs with AI in the title, only 2 are purely traditional ML (geospatial data science, physics simulation). Everything else assumes\n  you're building on top of foundation models, not training them from scratch.\n\n  The report's top skill — \"agents\" at 62% — is not a fluke. It reflects the dominant product pattern: companies are building vertical AI agents that do specific jobs (hospital operations, freight billing, sales outreach, insurance\n  processing). The role is less \"design a neural architecture\" and more \"orchestrate LLMs into reliable multi-step workflows.\"\n\nThe Skills That Actually Matter (In Priority Order)\n\nTier 1 — Non-negotiable:\n\n  - Python (59%) — universal baseline, no exceptions\n  - Agentic system design (62%) — tool calling, planning/execution loops, multi-agent orchestration. This is THE defining skill\n  - RAG pipelines — retrieval-augmented generation over domain-specific documents is in nearly every applied role\n  - LLM API fluency — knowing OpenAI, Anthropic/Claude, and how to prompt/fine-tune them effectively\n\nTier 2 — Strong differentiators:\n\n  - Evaluation frameworks — this is an emerging specialty. Companies like Sully.ai, goodfin, and Pylon explicitly call out \"LLM-as-judge,\" \"evaluation pipelines,\" and \"benchmarking\" as primary responsibilities. Knowing how to\n  systematically measure AI quality is becoming as important as building it\n  - AWS (51%) — cloud deployment is the default, AWS dominates\n  - TypeScript/React (39%) — AI engineers at startups are expected to be full-stack. You build the agent AND the UI\n  - Fine-tuning — more common than I expected. Companies like Persana AI and Conduit are going beyond prompting to actually fine-tune models for their domains\n\nTier 3 — Valuable but context-dependent:\n\n  - PyTorch (33%) — only matters if you're doing actual model training, not just API calls\n  - Docker/Kubernetes — infrastructure basics, expected but not the focus\n  - Vector databases / embeddings — important for RAG but becoming commoditized\n  - Go (21%) — surprisingly common, usually for backend/infra components alongside Python\n\nWhat the Market Does NOT Want\n\n  - Pure ML researchers — only ~3 roles in the entire dataset (Deepgram, Relace, AfterQuery). Startups aren't training foundation models\n  - CUDA/GPU optimization — 4 mentions out of 61 jobs. Leave this to NVIDIA and the hyperscalers\n  - Traditional data science (pandas, matplotlib, Jupyter notebooks) — the \"build dashboards and run A/B tests\" era is being replaced by \"build AI agents\"\n  - JAX, scikit-learn, classical ML frameworks — barely register\n\nThe Real Insight: \"AI Engineer\" Is a New Kind of Software Engineer\n\n  The most important takeaway isn't any single skill — it's that the \"AI Engineer\" role is fundamentally a software engineering role with AI as the primary tool. The best job descriptions (goodfin's Staff AI Engineer is the gold\n  standard) want someone who:\n\n  1. Understands LLM capabilities and limitations deeply\n  2. Can architect multi-step agentic systems that reason, not just generate\n  3. Builds evaluation infrastructure to know when things work\n  4. Ships production code with proper observability, error handling, and reliability\n  5. Thinks in product outcomes, not model metrics\n\n  goodfin's description nails it: \"The challenge is building systems that reason, compare tradeoffs, and surface uncertainty — not just generate fluent text.\"\n\nTwo Emerging Career Tracks Worth Watching\n\n  1. Forward Deployed AI Engineer — appeared at StackAI, HappyRobot, Phonely, Crustdata, and others. Part solutions engineer, part ML engineer. Deploys and adapts AI systems for enterprise customers. This didn't exist 2 years ago.\n  2. AI Evaluation Specialist — multiple companies now treat evals as a distinct discipline. Building automated evaluation pipelines, clinical-grade benchmarks, and LLM-as-judge systems is becoming its own specialization.\n\nBottom Line\n\n  If you're building an AI engineering skillset today, invest in: agentic system design, RAG, evaluation frameworks, and full-stack product building with Python + TypeScript. The market has clearly shifted from \"can you train a model?\"\n  to \"can you build a reliable AI product that does a real job?\"",

Claude thundering claims should be taken into the very limited context it had to work with, \"what yc early stages are buying\".\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to crack into that notoriously selective bubble and the strong network effects it induces, what they are buying is exactly the signal you need. As always in life, success has only a tenuous correlation with truth, technical excellence, meritocracy etc. The louder the claims of \"we only select and work with the absolute best\", the more vacuous the reality behind and more advanced the bullshit expertise of those selected.",

I could make models run, but I did not truly understand why they worked.\n\nLater, I started studying the underlying math, especially statistics, probability, linear algebra, and gradient descent. Concepts like loss functions, bias-variance tradeoff, and optimization suddenly made much more sense.\nIt changed my perspective completely. Models no longer felt magical, they felt logical.\n\nNow I am curious about others here:\nDid you experience a similar shift when learning the math behind ML?\n\nHow deep into math do you think someone needs to go to truly understand machine learning?\n\nIs it realistic to focus on applied ML first and strengthen math later?\n\nWould love to hear how others approached this.",

Learning HOW something works is often easier than learning WHY something works, especially in software where the HOW is the interface to a tool and the WHY is the underlying implementation. \n\nLearning tool interfaces, the “how” is a great stepping stone to learning the “why”. The how can guide/confine your options for explaining why one implementation was better than another, or why one expression was chosen over another equivalent one. \n\nI went the other direction in a lot of ways and I feel that knowing the “how” would have served me. It would have been easier to see why we were doing certain things if I already know how they were going to materialize and compose into a specific tool. \n\nMoreover, understanding those tools deeply is understanding the math concepts that work in practice and have stood the test of time and many use cases.",

Simply means a neural network using only simple maths, if has unlimited size, can approximate any function.\n\nSome fundamental maths of neural network: matrix calculus (simple form), derivative (first order), logarithm (1-2 types), basic statistics. I believe that you can cover (or review) them in just 1-2 weeks by doing some maths exercises.\n\nDefinitely some maths like ODE that I still don't understand. Or reverse entropy (if you want to apply to Havard postdoc with subject \"what is intelligence actually\"). Or some advanced AI (not mainstream, like HTM from Numenta). But you definitely don't need that if you don't pursue academic.\n\nIf I really want to learn AI from scratch, the last thing I want to do is to implement. AI is always advanced informatics. I strongly recommend the free book that will help you to build solid foundation fast. I read it one time, I read it again, again and again. I actually just read it again last month.

That path is real and valuable. But learning traditional ML, linear algebra, and especially statistics isn’t about memorizing old algorithms, it’s about building intuition. Stats helps you reason about uncertainty, bias, evaluation, and whether your system is actually working. Linear algebra helps you understand why embeddings, similarity, and dimensionality reduction behave the way they do. And classic ML teaches the discipline of modeling, debugging, and thinking in terms of data rather than just prompts.\n\nYou don’t need QKV-level depth unless you’re doing research, but having solid fundamentals makes your decisions sharper and your systems more reliable. It’s less about *how transformers multiply matrices* and more about *knowing when something is misleading, overfitting, or statistically weak*.\n\nSo yeah, you can skip parts of the traditional path if your goal is purely applied work.

          "text": "everyone has mentioned their professional, rational points on why one should learn trad ML, LA. I'll write about a very specific point which was drilled into me voluntarily by my 8 year old self. It has nothing to do with professional paths. I completely agree with the professional reasons of why you should peek behind the curtains.\n\n  \nI naturally forgot what was the name of the book, and what was the name of the fictional character, but there was a book by the legendary Isaac Asimov, most probably from the Robot series. There was a particular story/chapter where a person with the job robopsychologist says that over centuries, the human race had abstracted away so much of the inner workings of the intelligent beings, that their decisions and actions, which are at the end of the day, theoretically deterministic and entirely in the control of humans, were no longer plausible and controllable to the point where there was a person who did the job of robopsychologist, of talking to these robots and trying to comprehend their actions. The need for such dire measures arose due to severe abstraction.\n\nNow this is science fiction, and touch wood, we shall not face such problems any time soon, or within my lifetime atleast. But then, during the COVID era, I never dreamt that in the next 5 years, there would be a tool I could converse with and study for my exams efficiently. Even if you're not going into the full depths by reading PRML/ESLII/Goodfellow/etc., a simple understanding of weights, activation functions, basic intuition of attention mechanisms, etc. would really improve a person's throughput as an engineer in this field.\n\n\\[Note: I'm not in the industry as a working professional, I'm merely a sophomore. My opinions are based on whatever projects I've built, some of which won hackathons and from my internship stint at my country's number one AI startup\\]",

It's a recurring theme in teaching: when you draft a curriculum, what makes the cut?\n\n\\> What if a person wants to focus only on application layer above LLMs, can a person skip traditional ML learning path?\n\nOf course you can skip it. Should you? That depends on your context. Using a technology without understanding it is not a new concept. I have a fridge at home, but I don't know how it works. If my job was to repair refrigerators, I would want to know a thing or two about those. If my job was to make new refrigerators, I would want to know a thing or two (but different things) about fridges.\n\nSame with ML. What you need to learn is not universal. Are you in a position to just call an API and move on with your life? Are you orchestrating a distributed training pipeline? Are you optimizing model serving? Are you trying to beat a SOTA benchmark with a new model? Are you trying to understand how the current models work?\n\nFinally, in spite of all the jaw dropping advances in AI, there are still humans out there who just want to learn purely for learning's sake, believe it or not.",

You can skip Flask, Django, and the web dev ones entirely, they're great courses, but they won't help you with ML and you'll burn weeks on a tangent.\n\nOnce you're comfortable reading Python (loops, functions, classes, list comprehensions), jump straight to ML. Don't wait until you've finished the whole playlist. Here's what to move to:\n\nFree video courses:\n- Andrej Karpathy's \"Neural Networks: Zero to Hero\" (YouTube) — builds neural networks from scratch, teaches you ML-relevant Python as you go\n- 3Blue1Brown's neural networks series — short, visual, makes the math click\n\nFree books:\n- \"The Little Book of Deep Learning\" by Fleuret — 170 pages, free PDF, covers the whole field concisely\n\nLearn by reading real code:\n- I put together 30 single-file Python implementations of core ML algorithms — no frameworks, no dependencies, just Python. Each script is heavily commented so it reads like a tutorial. Good for seeing how Python is actually used to build ML, not just toy exercises: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/s/G0qj2zAEdw\n\nHands-on practice (free):\n- Kaggle — free beginner courses + competitions + free compute\n- Google Colab — free GPU for running notebooks\n\nBiggest mistake I see: spending months perfecting Python before ever writing ML code. You'll learn more Python in one week of building a neural network from scratch than in a month of general Python tutorials. Get the basics down, then dive in.",

      "text": "So, I assume we have all heard the phrase, \"ANN are universal function estimators\". And me in pursuit of trying to avoid doing any productive work set out to test the statement, turns out the statement I knew was incomplete error on my part. Correct phrasing is \"ANN are universal 'continuous function estimators.\" I discovered it while working on a project related with dynamics and velocity functions I was trying to predict were discontinuous. So after pulling my hair for few hours I found this thing. Neural nets are not good estimating discontinuous functions.   \nStory doesn't end here, say we have a continuous graph but it is kinky that is some points where it is not differentiable, can our nets fit these kinky ones well yes and no. The kinks invlove hard slope change and depending on the activation function we choose we can get sloppy approximations. On smooth functions like polynomials or sinx, cosx we can use Tanh but if we use this on say traingular wave graph we won't get best results. However if we use ReLU on triangular wave we can get pretty accurate predictions because ReLU is piecewise Linear. but both of em fail at fitting the discontinuous graph like squarewave. We can approximate them pretty closely using more dense and deep networks but in choatic dynamic systems(like billiard balls) where small errors can diverge into monsters. This can prove to be an annoying problem.   \n  \nColab Notebook Link - [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1\\_ypRF\\_Mc2fdGi-1uQGfjlB\\_eI1OxmzNl?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_ypRF_Mc2fdGi-1uQGfjlB_eI1OxmzNl?usp=sharing)  \n  \nMedium Link - [https://medium.com/@nomadic\\_seeker/universal-function-approximator-with-terms-conditions-16d3823abfa8](https://medium.com/@nomadic_seeker/universal-function-approximator-with-terms-conditions-16d3823abfa8)",

          "text": "Your graphs are a nice way of illustrating common pitfalls on the UAT, thank you for sharing!\n\n\nLoosely speaking, the universal approximation theorem states that a neural network of infinite depth can approximate any C(X, R^n) function (that is any continuous function on X subseteq R^n to R^n) arbitrarily well. Note that nothing explicitly requires differentiability, only continuity. \n\n\nSome of your graphs show some interesting behaviour that relates to the above theorem and activation functions you chose. A neural network with linear layers and ReLU activation functions constructs an output that will always be piecewise linear. You would need theoretically infinite linear pieces to approximate a non-linear function like sin(x). The triangular function is just a bunch of linear pieces stiched together which is why the Linear + ReLU network does fantastic here eventhough the function is clealy non-differentiable near the kinks. Choosing a tanh activation function really struggles with these kinks for the opposite reason. The output will be a linear combination of shifted and scaled tanh functions which are smooth and infinitely differentiable, which is why it struggles with the non-differentiable kinks!\n\nSmall edit to clarify: The UAT makes no claims about the exactness of the approximation, only that it is arbitrarily close under arbitrary distance norm in the function space. The linear + ReLU network for the triangular functions is a special case where the approximation does actually become exact with finite neurons as long as the domain X is bounded. The linear + tanh network would never actually converge to the exact same triangular wave function, just make an arbitrarily good approximation of it.",

Training end to end, over multiple runs using the same sequence of psuedo radom numbers, small differences due to the GPU diverge and two runs result in noticably different graphs -  even though the average is statistically stable.

I work in gis so spatial data is always my interest, but I don’t really think current llm models are capable of spatial reasoning, which is odd considering spatial reasoning is critical to human survival and progress. I know there are some companies doing stuff with computer vision and raster classification with AI, but most other applications are wanting. My after-midnight-and-a-joint fantasy is to create one massive geodatabase of every gis feature in the world and give it to ai. What would this accomplish? I have no idea. I am dumb.",

Right now you have to manually add controls points to scale, rotate and move the cad drawing into position over the building footprint. Then you have certain floors in the cad model that do not match the footprint but can be located based on internal structures like elevator shafts and stairwells. The objective is to geo locate cad data based on footprints, or aerial imagery. Auto georefrencing of images I believe is possible already thanks to ESRi deep learning, but more complex vector data, like cad and BIM data doesn’t work. It’s far more complex.",

          "text": "The list you have is a reasonable starting taxonomy, but the way industry actually works is quite different from how courses organize topics. Here's what matters in practice:\n\nWhat AI engineers actually do day-to-day:\n- Build and maintain RAG pipelines (retrieval, chunking, embedding, reranking)\n- Fine-tune models (LoRA, QLoRA, DPO) and evaluate outputs\n- Design agentic workflows (tool calling, routing, eval loops)\n- Optimize inference (quantization, KV caching, batching strategies)\n- Debug why things don't work — which requires understanding the internals, not just the API calls\n\nWhat that means for your study path:\n\nDon't try to learn those bullet points from your list as separate topics. They're deeply connected. LLMs use deep learning. RAG combines retrieval with LLMs. Gen AI is just the application layer on top of all of it. Learn them as a stack, not a checklist.\n\nMy recommended order:\n1. Python fluency — non-negotiable. You'll live in Python.\n2. Understand the core algorithms — transformers, attention, embeddings, backprop. Not from framework tutorials — from the actual math expressed as code. I put together 30 single-file, zero-dependency implementations of these algorithms for exactly this purpose: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/s/G0qj2zAEdw\n3. Build a RAG system end-to-end — this is the most common first project at any AI company right now\n4. Learn to evaluate — the gap between a demo and production is evaluation. Learn to measure whether your system actually works.\n5. Pick up infra basics — Docker, cloud deployment, API design. Companies need engineers who can ship, not just prototype.\n\nThe industry expectation that catches most people off guard: you're expected to debug and improve systems, not just build them. That requires knowing what's happening under the hood, not just which library to call.",

          "text": "After 12+ years building enterprise data platforms and agentic AI systems, I kept noticing the same pattern: teams that struggle with AI aren’t picking the wrong model — they’re feeding it the wrong context.\nI mapped every major AI pattern — RAG, agents, fine-tuning, memory systems — through the lens of context engineering. They all reduce to six operations: SELECT, COMPRESS, FORMAT, ISOLATE, PERSIST, and WRITE.\nOnce you see it this way, “should we use RAG or fine-tuning?” becomes the wrong question. RAG is a SELECT strategy. Fine-tuning is PERSIST. Prompt engineering is FORMAT + ISOLATE. The real question is: what composition of context operations does my specific problem require?\nCurious if this maps to what others are seeing in production.",
