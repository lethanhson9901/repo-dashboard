Research is over: If you look at , PyTorch has essentially flatlined TensorFlow in academia. If you are writing a paper in TF today, you are actively hurting your citation count.\n2. The \"Zombie\" Enterprise: Despite this, 40% of the Fortune 500 job listings I see still demand TensorFlow. Why? Because banks and insurance giants built massive TFX pipelines in 2019 that they refuse to rewrite.\n\nMy theory: TensorFlow is no longer a tool for innovation; it’s a tool for maintenance. If you want to build cool generative AI, learn PyTorch. If you want a stable, boring paycheck maintaining legacy fraud detection models, learn TensorFlow.\n\nIf anyone’s trying to make sense of this choice from a practical, enterprise point of view, this breakdown is genuinely helpful: [**PyTorch vs TensorFlow**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-enterprise-guide)\n\nAm I wrong?

As a result, you're essentially computing\n\n    z_{iron} = v_{iron} + noise ||v_{type}||/sqrt(N)\n\nnormalizing v, you're basically computing the actual concept vector for `v_{iron}`, plus noise of O(n^(-1/2)). E.g. if you can provide 100 `iron X` samples, your noise goes down to ~10%.\n\nIf structurally, iron and diamond items have the exact same types (e.g. swords, bars, etc), then the noise term will be structurally similar (same general direction), so `- z_{iron} + z_{diamond}` should be able to cancel the noise out almost perfectly. However, adding/subtracting concepts together without cancellation will amplify the noise, and categories with low # of types to average will have proportionally sqrt(N) times more noise.\n\nIt might be worthwhile to do a few power-iterations on the 2nd-moment operator `M = 1/N \\sum_{type} v_{iron type} v_{iron type}^T` using the mean `z_{iron}` direction to get to the real `v_{iron}` direction (probably converges in just 1-2 steps since the mean `z_{iron}` is already dominated in the `v_{iron}` direction). It's fairly cheap and would allow you to avoid the sqrt(N) noise term.",

If I ask it to generate new items, the quality is meh and I wouldn't be surprised if we did that experiment and asked it to generate something that did not exist in its training data, the VAE would struggle to generate something out of distribution like that. I am definetly making the task easier by trying to generate something that I know was present in the training data.\n\nTake the second example (the one where we turn a gold horse armor to a golden shovel). The fact that the generated shovel is yellow, shows that somewhere in the latent space, color of the object is one of the compressed features it learned to be useful for reconstructing.\n\nUltimately, the essence of the latents is that they are just 32 numbers trying to compress the information of a 3\\*16\\*16 = 768 pixel image. So the VAE has to find the most useful high-level features that characterize each image.",

A hands-on ML path that walks through classical models end-to-end (regression, trees, ensembles, clustering) will get you productive quickly. You don’t need deep learning immediately to be effective.\n\nProjects are where things actually click. Aim for 2–3 solid ones, not many:\n\n* one regression problem with messy real-world data\n* one classification problem where you explain model choice and tradeoffs\n* optionally one small NLP or tabular ML project if time allows\n\nWhat can wait: heavy DL, complex frameworks, and chasing SOTA models. Those add very little value this early.\n\nBiggest mistakes to avoid:\n\n* spending weeks on theory you already understand\n* jumping to PyTorch before you’re fluent in evaluation and data issues\n* copying Kaggle notebooks without explaining why things work\n\nIf you can explain your projects clearly, debug models, and talk about failure modes, you’ll be in a strong position after those 2–3 months.",

CNNs made sense once I understood basic image processing ideas. Autoencoders clicked as compression + reconstruction. Even time series models felt intuitive once I framed them as structured sequences with locality and dependency over time.\n\nBut RNNs? They’ve been uniquely hard in a way nothing else has been.\n\nIt’s not that the math is incomprehensible, or that I don’t understand sequences. I *do*. I understand sliding windows, autoregressive models, sequence-to-sequence setups, and I’ve even built LSTM-based projects before without fully “getting” what was going on internally.\n\nWhat trips me up is that RNNs don’t give me a stable mental model. The hidden state feels fundamentally opaque i.e. it's not like a feature map or a signal transformation, but a compressed, evolving internal memory whose semantics I can’t easily reason about. Every explanation feels syntactically different, but conceptually slippery in the same way.",

I think a natural progression to build up your intuition regarding latent-state models is to start with Discrete-time Hidden Markov Models, which are very easy to intuit.\n\nThe problem is that HMMs are inefficient in high dimensions. Factorial HMMs improve this by distributing the state into multiple binary variables, but this makes inference much more expensive to calculate. Intuitively, the fix is to move to Linear Dynamical Systems, where the state vectors are now continuous rather than discrete (think Kalman Filters, if you're familiar). This solves the representation problem, but now you have a linearity issue because you can only model simple curves. How do we fix that? We take the Linear Dynamical System and wrap the transition in a non-linear activation function. That is effectively an RNN.\n\nThere's a lot of nuance missing here and I've been a bit handwavey (it's not intended to fix your intuition) but I think there's value in studying what came before RNN's and building your intuition up from there, particularly in relation to what actually is actually going on in latent space, and what that represents. I'm unsure how helpful this is if you're not particularly interested in the theory, and just want some intuition. But I think the intuition comes from the theory, and seeing how it progresses.",

I did it so my project would feel more \"touchable\" and because I thought it would be good to learn important technologies like docker and FastAPI before going deeper in machine learning.\n\nThe Tech Stack:\n\nModel: XGBoost Regressor (Optimized to avoid overfitting, \\~15% MAPE).\n\nBackend: FastAPI (for serving predictions).\n\nFrontend: Streamlit (for user interaction).\n\nInfrastructure:  Docker & Docker Compose (separated services).\n\nI would love some feedback on the project structure. Any kind of feedback is welcomed, it can be about the model, architecture or literally anything\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/hvbridi/XGBRegressor-on-car-prices/tree/main](https://github.com/hvbridi/XGBRegressor-on-car-prices/tree/main)\n\nThanks!",

With deep neural networks, overfitting is not a feature. It is a bug.\n\nMedium Link for better readability: [https://vizuara.medium.com/an-introduction-to-physics-informed-neural-networks-pinns-teach-your-neural-network-to-respect-af484ac650fc](https://vizuara.medium.com/an-introduction-to-physics-informed-neural-networks-pinns-teach-your-neural-network-to-respect-af484ac650fc)\n\nLet us consider a hypothetical set of experiments. You throw a ball up (or at an angle), and note down the height of the ball at different points of time.\n\nWhen you plot the height v/s time, you will see something like this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b9byjx62pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=22aebc098ad30d2b18505fcaa3d80cf61777f2b5\n\nIt is easy to train a neural network on this dataset so that you can predict the height of the ball even at time points where you did not note down the height in your experiments.\n\nFirst, let us discuss how this training is done.\n\n# Training a regular neural network\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/732wrp23pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c65e4fc46e3a8fd8fcac281361ece4328932f2b\n\nYou can construct a neural network with few or multiple hidden layers. The input is time (t) and the output predicted by the neural network is height of the ball (h).\n\nThe neural network will be initialized with random weights. This means the predictions of h(t) made by the neural network will be very bad initially as shown in the image below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdgeu9s4pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e97b932fe7bef937f45716295435c7d50c0212f\n\nWe need to penalize the neural network for making these bad predictions right? How do we do that? In the form of loss functions.\n\nLoss of a neural network is a measure of how bad its predictions are compared the real data. The close the predictions and data, the lower the loss.\n\nA singular goal of neural network training is to minimize the loss.\n\nSo how can we define the loss here? Consider the 3 options below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/slcx6y27pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcccb9ec6c9aac8b976b71ae5a7f7f6dfd481c24\n\nIn all the 3 options, you are finding the average of some kind of loss.\n\n* **Option 1 is not good** because positive and negative errors will cancel each other.\n* **Option 2 is okay** because we are taking the absolute value of errors, but the problem is modulus function is not differentiable at x=0.\n* **Option 3 is the best**. It is a square function which means individual errors are converted to positive numbers and the function is differentiable. This is the famous Mean Squared Error (MSE). You are taking the mean value of the square of all individual errors.\n\nHere error means the difference between actual value and predicted value.\n\nMean Squared Error is minimum when the predictions are very close to the experimental data as shown in the figure below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwm6mxq8pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=33983e165ecec1efca3a973e97b3d28aa2a89782\n\nBut there is a problem with this approach. What if your experimental data was not good? In the image below you can see that one of the data points is not following the trend shown by the rest of the dataset.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mswknvl9pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=71546cc05f741175a11e486ae3fe6a77c44b82e7\n\nThere can be multiple reasons due to which such data points show up in the data.\n\n1. You did not perform the experiments well. You made a manual mistake while noting the height.\n2. The sensor or instrument using which you were making the height measurement was faulty.\n3. A sudden gush of wind caused a sudden jump in the height of the ball.\n\nThere could be many possibilities that results in outliers and noise in a dataset.\n\nKnowing that real life data may have noise and outliers, it will not be wise if we train a neural network to exactly mimic this dataset. It results in something called as overfitting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1e7r509apwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3269c58b8ca9e873945ca9970aafac78bc53279\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l0fgrzrapwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=28acb46d2af8e6398876ee107b7900e860061904\n\nIn the figure above, mean squared error will be low in both cases. However in one case neural network is fitting on outlier also, which is not good. So what should we do?\n\n# Bring physics into the picture\n\nIf you are throwing a ball and observing its physics, then you already have some knowledge about the trajectory of the ball, based on Newton’s laws of motion.\n\nSure, you may be making simplifications by assuming that the effect of wind or air drag or buoyancy are negligible. But that does not take away from the fact that you already have decent knowledge about this system even in the absence of a trained neural network.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8cudgx0epwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=9efaf22e50525030c0ceaa9995b0afe96a26c79d\n\nThe physics you assume may not be in perfect agreement with the experimental data as shown above, but it makes sense to think that the experiments will not deviate too much from physics.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fpy7q3oepwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5ff5cacaf8b8d2895139589897c6dd3d670be9\n\nSo if one of your experimental data points deviate too much from what physics says, there is probably something wrong with that data point. So how can you let you neural network take care of this?\n\n# How can you teach physics to neural networks?\n\nIf you want to teach physics to neural network, then you have to somehow incentivize neural network to make predictions closer to what is suggested by physics.\n\nIf the neural network makes a prediction where the height of the ball is far away from the purple dotted line, then loss should increase.\n\nIf the predictions are closer to the dotted line, then the loss should be minimum.\n\nWhat does this mean? Modify the loss function.\n\nHow can you modify the loss function such that the loss is high when predictions deviate from physics? And how does this enable the neural network make more physically sensible predictions? **Enter PINN Physics Informed Neural Network.**  \n  \nPhysics Informed Neural Network (PINN)\n\nThe goal of PINNs is to solve (*or learn solutions to*) differential equations by embedding the known physics (or governing differential equations) directly into the neural network’s training objective (loss function).\n\nThe idea of PINNs were introduced in this seminal paper by Maziar Raissi et. al.: [https://maziarraissi.github.io/PINNs/](https://maziarraissi.github.io/PINNs/)\n\nThe basic idea in PINN is to have a neural network is trained to minimize a loss function that includes:\n\n1. A **data mismatch** term (*if observational data are available*).\n2. A **physics loss** term enforcing the differential equation itself (and initial/boundary conditions).\n\n# Let us implement PINN on our example\n\nLet us look at what we know about our example. When a ball is thrown up, it trajectory h(t) varies according to the following ordinary differential equation (ODE).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vacsz6dlpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=14111c810dba1e861fbcc71a1bf8d920e479448c\n\nHowever this ODE alone cannot fully describe h(t) uniquely. You also need an initial condition. Mathematically this is because to solve a first-order differential equation in time, you need 1 initial condition.\n\nLogically, to know height as a function of time, you need to know the starting height from which the ball was thrown. Look at the image below. In both cases, the balls are thrown at the exact same time with the exact same initial velocity component in the vertical direction. But the h(t) depends on the initial height. So you need to know h(t=0) for fully describing the height of the ball as a function of time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eobv9u1mpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=a28a6c8584f37683f703b4c72a5a8f436353dedc\n\nThis means it is not enough to make the neural network make accurate predictions on dh/dt, the neural network should also make accurate prediction on h(t=0) for fully matching the physics in this case.\n\n# Loss due to dh/dt (ODE loss)\n\nWe know the expected dh/dt because we know the initial velocity and acceleration due to gravity.\n\nHow do we get the dh/dt predicted by the neural network? After all it is predicting height h, not velocity v or dh/dt. The answer is **Automatic differentiation (AD).**\n\nBecause most machine‐learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX) support automatic differentiation, you can compute dh/dt by differentiating the neural network.\n\nThus, we have a predicted dh/dt (from the neural network differentiation) for every experimental time points, and we have an actual dh/dt based on the physics.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/msf6gyunpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=1392d9e60f5ee011a480392af07e05bc5d094492\n\nNow we can define a loss due to the difference between predicted and physics-based dh/dt.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/68xl4xpopwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b9a727be489bd8736e8ffc235f49fca5dc25b9a\n\nMinimizing this loss (which I prefer to call ODE loss) is a good thing to ensure that neural network learns the ODE. But that is not enough. We need to make the neural network follow the initial condition also. That brings us to the next loss term.Initial condition loss\n\n# Initial condition loss\n\nThis is easy. You know the initial condition. You make the neural network make a prediction of height for t=0. See how far off the prediction is from the reality. You can construct a squared error which can be called as the *Initial Condition Loss.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4u4syj1qpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=591b7e0f46ebf32024533c9d727042a889c3007d\n\nSo is that it? You have ODE loss and Initial condition loss. Is it enough that the neural network tries to minimize these 2 losses? What about the experimental data? There are 3 things to consider.\n\n1. You cannot throw away the experimental data.\n2. You cannot neglect the physics described by the ODEs or PDEs.\n3. You cannot neglect the initial and/or boundary conditions.\n\nThus you have to also consider the data-based mean squared error loss along with ODE loss and Initial condition loss.\n\n# The modified loss term\n\nThe simple mean squared error based loss term can now be modified like below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2xc18prpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=95fabc8b54b2b291292d6ab2c15f5810c13379ce\n\nIf there are boundary conditions in addition to initial conditions, you can add an additional term based on the difference between predicted boundary conditions and actual boundary conditions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezh3in7spwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=70367e6fbb1aa6e7924d93da8ff3b0ce8898419d\n\nHere the Data loss term ensures that the predictions are not too far from the experimental data points.\n\nThe *ODE loss term* \\+ the *initial condition loss term* ensures that the predictions are not too far from what described by the physics.\n\nIf you are pretty sure about the physics the you can set λ1 to zero. In the ball throwing experiment, you will be sure about the physics described by our ODE if air drag, wind, buoyancy and any other factors are ignored. Only gravity is present. And in such cases, the PINN effectively becomes an ODE solver.\n\nHowever, for real life cases where only part of the physics is known or if you are not fully sure of the ODE, then you retain λ1 and other λ terms in the net loss term. That way you force the neural network to respect physics as well as the experimental data. This also suppress the effects of experimental noise and outliers.\n\n>",

      "text": "I've spent the last few weeks building a GPT-style LLM entirely from scratch in PyTorch to understand the architecture. This isn't just a wrapper; it's a full implementation covering the entire lifecycle from tokenization to instruction fine-tuning.\n\nI have followed Sebastian Raschka's 'Build a LLM from Scratch' book for the implementation, here is the breakdown of the repo:\n\n**1. Data & Tokenization (**`src/data.py`**)** Instead of using pre-built tokenizers, I implemented:\n\n* `SimpleTokenizerV2`: Handles regex-based splitting and special tokens (`<|endoftext|>`, `<|unk|>`).\n* `GPTDatasetV1`: A sliding-window dataset implementation for efficient autoregressive training.\n\n**2. The Attention Mechanism (**`src/attention.py`**)**\n\nI manually implemented `MultiHeadAttention` to understand the tensor math:\n\n* Handles the query/key/value projections and splitting heads.\n* Implements the **Causal Mask** (using `register_buffer`) to prevent the model from \"cheating\" by seeing future tokens.\n* Includes `SpatialDropout` and scaled dot-product attention.\n\n**3. The GPT Architecture (**`src/model.py`**)** A complete 124M parameter model assembly:\n\n* Combines `TransformerBlock`, `LayerNorm`, and `GELU` activations.\n* Features positional embeddings and residual connections exactly matching the GPT-2 spec.\n\n**4. Training & Generation (**`src/train.py`**)**\n\n* Custom training loop with loss visualization.\n* Implements `generate()` with **Top-K sampling** and **Temperature scaling** to control output creativity.\n\n**5. Fine-tuning:**\n\n* **Classification (**`src/finetune_classification.py`**):** Adapted the backbone to detect Spam/Ham messages (90%+ accuracy on the test set).\n* **Instruction Tuning (**`src/finetune_instructions.py`**):** Implemented an Alpaca-style training loop. The model can now handle instruction-response pairs rather than just completing text.\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/Nikshaan/llm-from-scratch](https://github.com/Nikshaan/llm-from-scratch)\n\nI’ve tried to comment every shape transformation in the code.

ML is a huge domain from traditional statistical models to transformers and LLM's. You need to narrow it down to a domain and then proceed with an idea in the same, preferably start by reading and gradually implementing a simple research paper in that domain to get the gist of it followed by something a bit more novel.

Sometimes I feel like I still do not know much, which is probably normal at this stage.\n\nI have been stuck trying to choose between Data Engineering and Machine Learning as a career path. Every time I read Reddit or Twitter, I see totally different opinions. Some people say DE is more stable and practical, others say ML is more interesting but very competitive. Honestly it is making me more confused than helping.\n\nA bit about me:\n\n* Still early in coding, no real industry experience yet\n* I enjoy understanding concepts and the “why” behind things\n* I get overwhelmed when there are too many tools and technologies at once\n* I would rather build and learn gradually instead of jumping into heavy cloud and infra immediately\n* Long term I care about enjoying the work and not burning out\n* money\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. For someone like me, which path makes more sense long term, DE or ML?\n2. How much cloud, system design, or MLOps is actually expected for entry level roles in each?\n3. If you were starting today from scratch, what would you focus on first?\n4.

All we know is that you've done a few small projects and that you're confused, but knowing nothing about your motivations or interests, it's impossible to say.\n\n>2. How much cloud, system design, or MLOps is actually expected for entry level roles in each?\n\nVery little is expected in entry-level roles, but you will almost certainly not find entry-level roles in either field. Data engineering and ML Engineering (which is what I'm assuming you mean when you say Machine Learning, as being a Machine Learning Scientist is a different role altogether) are extensions of software engineering, and by their nature involve a lot of interdisciplinary skills. While it's the company-specific role that dictates how much cloud or MLOps is involved, you will need a solid foundation in software engineering principles, as well as (at a minimum) basic exposure to building data pipelines, managing deployments, and system design.\n\n>3. If you were starting today from scratch, what would you focus on first?\n\nThe fundamentals of software development, starting with proficiency in Python, SQL, an RDBMS like Postgres, git, and basic tooling (e.g., using uv to manage your dependencies for a project.) Focus on building projects using software best practices (modular design, loose coupling, tests, thoughtful relational design, etc).\n\nThe majority of this experience will come from building things. Start with small scripts, and as your projects grow, google around for how to keep your projects maintainable. Books like *A Philosophy of Software Design* and *The Mythical Man-Month* are great, but they won't replace hands-on time struggling organizing the code you write.\n\n>4. Any lessons or regrets from people who picked one over the other?\n\nEither side is hard. You'd be making a mistake by going into this thinking you'll be working in either role within a couple of years, especially with no coding or industry experience. Focus on the fundamentals of building software and becoming a good coder first, as that on its own will take you a while, but there aren't any shortcuts.",

What drew you to either concept in the first place? Why are you trying to learn? All we know is that you've done a few small projects and that you're confused, but knowing nothing about your motivations or interests,\n\nTo be honest, I am an undergraduate, and I first learned about machine learning through the hype surrounding it. If I am being honest, I was more interested in traditional machine learning predictions rather than just NLP and LLMs. However, over time, I realized how high the entry-level barrier is and how difficult it is to get into the field.\n\nRecently, I learned about data engineering, and based on my research, many of the concepts overlap, and it does not seem as oversaturated as machine learning, although I could be wrong.\n\nThis has made me confused.\n\nIt is embarrassing to say, but one of my main motivations is money, especially since I do not come from a strong economic background.\n\nEdit: so far I have done Andrew Ng course and Solving problems in Hackerrank to improve my programming skills",

As long as you're working on the other CS and programming fundamentals I mentioned, I would say it's even preferred to start to specialize in school. \n\nBut don't get so focused on one path that you forego others that might just as or even more interesting to you. In my opinion, you'll never have as much freedom to explore your intellectual curiosity as you will while you're still in school, so make sure you're taking advantage of that. \n\n>let my specialization develop based on the job I get?\n\nIf you have no particular pull toward one field over another, then sure, letting your job dictate what you want to specialize in is totally fine. Many people go that route. The problem is that for DE and ML in particular, especially for entry-level jobs, having some additional experience via coursework and projects in those areas can give you a big leg up in landing those jobs. So if you're sure you want to pursue those, it'll help you to start adding a bit of specificity into your coursework and project work in anticipation.\n\nLike I mentioned above, DE and ML are extensions of software engineering, and it's easier to go from a specific field to a more general programming job than the other way around.",

Each token becomes an integer ID the model can process. See it here: [https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/](https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/)\n2. **Embedding:** Each token ID is mapped to a dense vector representing semantic meaning. Similar meanings produce vectors close in mathematical space.\n3. **Positional Encoding:** Position information is added so word order is known. This allows the model to distinguish “dog bites man” from “man bites dog”.\n4. **Transformer Encoding (Self-Attention):** Every token attends to every other token to understand context. Relationships like subject, object, tense, and intent are computed.\\[See the process here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M&t=183s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M&t=183s) \\]\n5. **Deep Layer Processing:** The network passes information through many layers to refine understanding. Meaning becomes more abstract and context-aware at each layer.\n6. **Logit Generation:** The model computes scores for all possible next tokens. These scores represent likelihood before normalization.\n7. **Probability Normalization (Softmax):** Scores are converted into probabilities between 0 and 1. Higher probability means the token is more likely to be chosen.\n8. **Decoding / Sampling:** A strategy (greedy, top-k, top-p, temperature) selects one token. This balances coherence and creativity.\n9. **Autoregressive Feedback:** The chosen token is appended to the input sequence. The process repeats to generate the next token.\n10. **Detokenization:** Token IDs are converted back into readable text. Sub-words are merged to form the final response.\n\nThat is the full internal generation loop behind an LLM response.",

Best kind of correct.\n\nJust suddenly we arrived at the point where autocomplete is good enough to do many tasks, should that tasks be describable in the language autocomplete was trained on. Which, if you think about it - totally makes sense, especially with certain neural language models qualities making them capable of remembering more generic patterns than just \"strictly word 1 - strictly word 2 - ... - strictly word N\" N-grams. Because once task and decision can be described in language - it is only matter of probability to solve it via autocomplete (and so - boosting that probability).",

However, to predict next tokens you need to learn the latent representation and build a probabilistic internal model of the information it's been exposed to. \n\nFoundational models are very general systems. They try to generalise very heavily since they are trying to match a probabilistic state of getting the least loss on cross entropy loss or so. Human intelligence is a lot like how next token prediction work. Not on fundamental working but analogically as a llm converts language into their internal representation and produce output just like humans convert language into internal representation to understand words and meanings and then respond.",
