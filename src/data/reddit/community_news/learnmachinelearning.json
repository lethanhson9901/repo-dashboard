I think we all implemented a very basic gradient with the basic derivative formula for N1 and N2 functions with very simple step size calculation based on the slope angle when we learned about finding local minima. Then we learn the chain-rule matrix formulas for back propagating errors to compute the slope, and its a more intuitive transition.",

As a result, you're essentially computing\n\n    z_{iron} = v_{iron} + noise ||v_{type}||/sqrt(N)\n\nnormalizing v, you're basically computing the actual concept vector for `v_{iron}`, plus noise of O(n^(-1/2)). E.g. if you can provide 100 `iron X` samples, your noise goes down to ~10%.\n\nIf structurally, iron and diamond items have the exact same types (e.g. swords, bars, etc), then the noise term will be structurally similar (same general direction), so `- z_{iron} + z_{diamond}` should be able to cancel the noise out almost perfectly. However, adding/subtracting concepts together without cancellation will amplify the noise, and categories with low # of types to average will have proportionally sqrt(N) times more noise.\n\nIt might be worthwhile to do a few power-iterations on the 2nd-moment operator `M = 1/N \\sum_{type} v_{iron type} v_{iron type}^T` using the mean `z_{iron}` direction to get to the real `v_{iron}` direction (probably converges in just 1-2 steps since the mean `z_{iron}` is already dominated in the `v_{iron}` direction). It's fairly cheap and would allow you to avoid the sqrt(N) noise term.",

If I ask it to generate new items, the quality is meh and I wouldn't be surprised if we did that experiment and asked it to generate something that did not exist in its training data, the VAE would struggle to generate something out of distribution like that. I am definetly making the task easier by trying to generate something that I know was present in the training data.\n\nTake the second example (the one where we turn a gold horse armor to a golden shovel). The fact that the generated shovel is yellow, shows that somewhere in the latent space, color of the object is one of the compressed features it learned to be useful for reconstructing.\n\nUltimately, the essence of the latents is that they are just 32 numbers trying to compress the information of a 3\\*16\\*16 = 768 pixel image. So the VAE has to find the most useful high-level features that characterize each image.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been reviewing the basics for upcoming interviews, and I realized I often get stuck trying to explain simple concepts without using jargon.\n\nI wrote down a summary for the top 10 algorithms to help me memorize them. I figured this might help others here who are just starting out or refreshing their memory.\n\nHere is the list:\n\n# 1. Linear Regression\n\n* **The Gist:** Drawing the straightest possible line through a scatter plot of data points to predict a value (like predicting house prices based on size).\n* **Key Concept:** Minimizing the \"error\" (distance) between the line and the actual data points.\n\n# 2. Logistic Regression\n\n* **The Gist:** Despite the name, it's for **classification**, not regression. It fits an \"S\" shaped curve (Sigmoid) to the data to separate it into two groups (e.g., \"Spam\" vs. \"Not Spam\").\n* **Key Concept:** It outputs a probability between 0 and 1.\n\n# 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n\n* **The Gist:** The \"peer pressure\" algorithm. If you want to know what a new data point is, you look at its 'K' nearest neighbors. If most of them are Blue, the new point is probably Blue.\n* **Key Concept:** It doesn't actually \"learn\" a model; it just memorizes the data (Lazy Learner).\n\n# 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n\n* **The Gist:** Imagine two groups of data on the floor. SVM tries to put a wide street (hyperplane) between them. The goal is to make the street as wide as possible without touching any data points.\n* **Key Concept:** The \"Kernel Trick\" allows it to separate data that isn't easily separable by a straight line by projecting it into higher dimensions.\n\n# 5. Decision Trees\n\n* **The Gist:** A flowchart of questions. \"Is it raining?\" -> Yes -> \"Is it windy?\" -> No -> \"Play Tennis.\" It splits data into smaller and smaller chunks based on simple rules.\n* **Key Concept:** Easy to interpret, but prone to \"overfitting\" (memorizing the data too perfectly).\n\n# 6. Random Forest\n\n* **The Gist:** A democracy of Decision Trees. You build 100 different trees and let them vote on the answer. The majority wins.\n* **Key Concept:** Reduces the risk of errors that a single tree might make (Ensemble Learning).\n\n# 7. K-Means Clustering\n\n* **The Gist:** You have a messy pile of unlabelled data. You want to organize it into 'K' number of piles. The algorithm randomly picks centers for the piles and keeps moving them until the groups make sense.\n* **Key Concept:** Unsupervised learning (we don't know the answers beforehand).\n\n# 8. Naive Bayes\n\n* **The Gist:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. It assumes that all features are independent (which is \"naive\" because in real life, things are usually related).\n* **Key Concept:** Surprisingly good for text classification (like filtering emails).\n\n# 9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n\n* **The Gist:** Data compression. You have a dataset with 50 columns (features), but you only want the 2 or 3 that matter most. PCA combines variables to reduce complexity while keeping the important information.\n* **Key Concept:** Dimensionality Reduction.\n\n# 10. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)\n\n* **The Gist:** Similar to Random Forest, but instead of building trees at the same time, it builds them one by one. Each new tree tries to fix the mistakes of the previous tree.\n* **Key Concept:** Often the winner of Kaggle competitions for tabular data.\n\nIf you want to connect these concepts to real production workflows, one helpful resource is a hands-on course on Machine Learning on Google Cloud. It shows how algorithms like Linear/Logistic Regression, PCA, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting: [Machine Learning on Google Cloud](https://www.netcomlearning.com/course/machine-learning-on-google-cloud)\n\nLet me know if I missed any major ones or if you have a better analogy for them!",

It fits an \"S\" shaped curve (Sigmoid) to the data to separate it into two groups (e.g., \"Spam\" vs. \"Not Spam\").\n\nThis isn't correct: regression is descriptive of the model being fit, classification is one use case for it. It isn't fitting an s-shaped curve directly, the fit is actually linear with respect to the log-odds, not the probability itself. The s-curve arises when you convert the output of the model back to probabilities.\n\nUnderstanding that the output people normally work with \"lives\" in a different space than the model is important if you're interpreting coefficients, or if you want to use a linear model with other types of responses. You can use Poisson/Negative Binomial regression for count data, beta regression for continuous proportions, gamma regression for data that is positive continuous and skewed, etc. All of these (and logistic regression) are types of Generalized Linear Models that differ by the function used to go from the original scale of the data to the scale the model is being fit on. Interestingly enough, this is an avenue for modeling probabilities in alternative ways - you get different shaped s-curves if you use probit, Chauchit, Cloglog functions instead of logit, for example. Not super common but worth knowing about.\n\n>**The Gist:** Data compression. You have a dataset with 50 columns (features), but you only want the 2 or 3 that matter most. PCA combines variables to reduce complexity while keeping the important information.\n\nAlso worth noting that this is just one thing PCA is particularly useful for. What you're doing is making new variables that \"explain\" the variance of the data independently of one another (they're uncorrelated/orthogonal). The first one captures the most variability, the second one captures the most variance in the absence of the first, and so on and so forth. You end up with 50 new columns containing the same information as the original data, but past a certain point they're just capturing the leftovers.\n\nPCA doesn't necessarily reduce complexity (in terms of information) directly, it allows you to cut out as much of it as you can without sacrificing fidelity - past the first few components, the only thing being captured is smaller and smaller chunks of noise. Sort of like discarding pixels in a region of an image that appears purely black to the naked eye and probably only differs due to camera sensor noise - you could use interpolation to reconstruct most of them and nobody would be the wiser. Note: a fun idea to play with here is to actually use PCA for compression. You can start with a dataset that has a column for each color channel and a row for each pixel, and then see what happens if you start pooling information for nearby pixels. \n\nComplexity is also reduced in a practical sensed because correlated variables end up getting decomposed into variables that contain shared and unique information. If they're highly correlated, that unique information isn't contributing much and may end up getting discarded - you're effectively collapsing dimensions.",

They had the impression that \"applied statistics\" was more about applying statistics to things, but the program was 90% derivations and proofs. The distinction is in what kind of theory is used and how: you need statistical theory to learn how the things people use work, which requires a fair bit of math. If you want to do academic research, this shifts to learning how the theory itself works.  \n\nAll of that is to say that if you want to get serious about building things with ML, approach it like engineering. Engineers need to take physics because their work depends on understanding it, but they don't need to understand it at the level of a physicist. For ML that might like being able to reason quantitatively about the tools you're using - you don't need to study the theory of optimization super deeply, but you should have an understanding of optimization as it pertains to what you're working with.",

If your goal is shipping, spend time understanding how models degrade, how you detect that, and how you iterate safely. LLMs make demos easy, but production work is mostly about constraints and trade-offs. the fastest progress usually comes from building small end-to-end things and being honest about where they break, and that intuition transfers better than chasing the latest architecture.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been tracking the market for a while, and the salary data on this sub usually swings between \"I can't find a job\" and \"Influencers say I should make $300k starting.\"\n\nI wanted to open a discussion on the real salary tiers right now, because it feels like the market has split into two completely different realities. From what I’m seeing in job descriptions vs. actual offers, here is the breakdown.\n\nI’d love for the Seniors here to weigh in and correct me if this matches your experience.\n\nTier 1: The \"Jupyter Notebook\" Engineer\n\n* Role: You can train models, clean data, and use Scikit-Learn/PyTorch in a notebook environment.\n* Reality: This market is oversaturated.\n\nTier 2: The \"Production\" MLE (Where the money is)\n\n* Role: You don't just train models; you serve them. You know Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and how to optimize inference latency.\n* The Jump: The salary often jumps 40-50% here. The gap isn't about better math; it’s about Software Engineering.\n\nTier 3: The \"Specialized\" Engineer\n\n* Role: Custom CUDA kernels, distributed training systems, or novel LLM architecture.\n* Comp: Outlier salaries.\n\nThe Question for the Community: For those of you who broke past the $150k mark: What was the specific technical skill that got you the raise? Was it System Design? MLOps? Or just YOE?\n\nWhile researching benchmarks, I found this breakdown on [**machine learning engineer salary**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/machine-learning-engineer-salary) trends helpful to get a baseline, but the discussion on this sub often tells a different story.\n\nLet's get a realistic thread going.

There are engineers that do work closer to 1 at my company and others closer to 2. 3 is rather rare where I work although some exist. Pay is not particularly different across the 3 within my company. They often overlap a lot in titles too.\n\nIf you want money then the answer is aim for top paying companies and work up career ladder. Job hopping is fine early on, it’s hard to make staff+ by job hopping and for that you tend to need to get promoted.\n\nMy current place pays seniors (5+ years experience) in ml around 500-600ish before bonus. Bonus are very variable with many getting little and some getting another 200k. Staff/senior staff/principal exist too as levels and I think staff is 800k roughly while senior staff is low million (unsure principal is, that’s quite rare).\n\nTop places are basically few ai startups, openai, finance. Those can pay close to a million for senior level. Unsure where openai sits for people that join today but a couple years ago I had a friend join as a senior for ~1.5 million comp there.",

Most real ML work is not about the algorithm at all, but about turning a vague goal into a concrete, testable question and accepting imperfect data. One way to reduce the overwhelm is to start by stripping the problem down to the smallest version that would still be useful, even if it feels almost trivial. Build something that works end to end, even if it is naive, and then iterate. Over time, you realize the messiness is the work, not a sign that you are doing it wrong.",

A good combination of the material is the recent Foundation of Machine Learning. \n\nBut my own perspective on this is: just because you know the math, doesn’t mean you need to use it. You could read all of what I suggested and not know a thing about what people are working on today. If instead that’s ur goal, then u should just do what everyone else is doing: ie do online courses on machine learning and deep learning and RL from top universities (Berkeley and Stanford are good starting points to look). If ur math is advanced then you can run thru some problems quite quickly but you will probably still find a good amount of things to be non trivial. Also if ur comfortable with research level math the theoretical research for ML should not be daunting once you have done the courses, and you can go from there.",

There’s some overlap there — if your research artifacts are commonly used as state of the art industrial benchmarks then your name will carry weight, but at that point you’ll probably be leading a team of FAANG engineers. \n\nAnyways, to OOP your benchmarks and directions are sort of misaligned, to be honest.
