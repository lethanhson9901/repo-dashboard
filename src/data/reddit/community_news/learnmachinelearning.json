I had a look through your code and read your post and it does look like a lot is ai generated (for me giveaways are * arguments in the function, emojis used in print statements, lack of type hints). It’s fine to use AI in your code but make sure you go back through it and really understand what part does- try and add type hints manually and add doc strings. Maybe try and explain the model architecture choice too- why did you choose that specific number of conv layers etc?",

What I mean is did u test validation on 20-50 epoch on 10k size dataset with size Float32, or something of the sorts, or you went directly for int8.\n\nLearning rates, how did you manage them, did u keep it static, decay , warmups or anything, did u shuffle the dataset for getting it' into normal distribution.\n\nAmazing work overall",

      "text": "\nI recently landed an AI Engineer role after a pretty intense job hunt, and I thought I had shared some tips on how to crack it especially in this crazy 2025/2026 market where everyone's chasing AI jobs. It is tough out there, but totally doable if you focus on the right stuff. Here's what worked for me and what I have seen from friends who made it too. My background is software development with 6 years of experience. As lot of my existing project moved to AI so that's why I decided to change my domain to AI/ML. Frankly, Domain change is a tough task, not just about learning a new tech stack altogether and cracking an interview(this is easy actually), but when you start working in a company as AI Engineer, then real challenges come for the initial 4-5 months.\nBelow is my preparation strategy\n\n1. BUILD FOUNDATIONS:\n\nPython is a must. Around 70–80% of AI ML job postings expect solid Python skills, so there is no way around it.\n\nGet comfortable with core libraries:\n\n• NumPy & Pandas for data handling\n• Scikit learn for classic machine learning\n• PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning\n\nFor interviews, don’t just rely on theory. I personally spent months grinding LeetCode for coding rounds, but I also practiced ML specific coding, like:\n\n• Implementing gradient descent from scratch\n• Writing a basic neural network without using high level APIs\n\nMath matters more than people admit. You don’t need to be a math genius, but you should understand:\n\n• Linear algebra\n• Basic calculus\n• Probability and statistics\n\nUsually, the interviewers evaluate concepts such as bias variance tradeoff, regularization, overfitting vs underfitting, and the reasons why the model acts that way.\n\nAlthough I believe in self learning, there are some decent courses to make thins little faster. As its a new domain all together there are a lot of chances. I may be confused or take wrong direction. Below are some of my preferred course suggestions that significantly contributed to my strong foundation and keeping up-to-date with AI Engineer positions:\n\n• Coursera – Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization: A classic course to understand ML theory and intuition, ideal if you are revisiting the basics.\n\n• Fast ai – Practical Deep Learning for Coders: Free course with hands-on PyTorch exercises, teaches you to build real world models quickly without focusing too much on the math initially.\n\n• LogicMojo AI/ML Course : A course that teaches AI & ML basics through project work and practical exercises, beneficial for both theoretical and practical knowledge. I developed my AI project under the guidance of mentor.\n\n• Udemy Self paced: Inexpensive courses with lots of programming tasks; opt for those that are portfolio-oriented using tools such as LangChain or\n\n2. BUILD REAL, HANDS ON PROJECTS:\n\nProjects make or break your profile. Recruiter’s love seeing a GitHub with real, working stuff, not just notebooks that never left your laptop.\n\nFocus on end to end projects where you handle everything:\n\ndata → model → API → deployment.\n\nSome projects that helped me stand out:\n\n• A RAG system using LangChain.\n• Fine tuning a small LLM on Hugging Face for a custom use case.\n• A computer vision project like image classification or object detection.\n• Kaggle competitions are underrated gold. Even if you don’t rank high, participation shows curiosity, consistency, and real problem solving.\n\nTry deploying at least one project. Use AWS, GCP, or Vercel anything that proves you can ship.\n\nLearn basic MLOps:\n\n• Docker\n• Model versioning\n• Simple CI/CD\n\nThis part really helps because a lot of “AI professionals” can train models, but can’t productionize them and companies care about production.\n\n3.

As these systems improve through training on real-world examples, which is a core principle of machine learning. Instead of following some random logics, they predict likely outcomes based on learned behavior. This makes vibe coding a practical application of machine learning in everyday software development.",

Sincerely hope the guy has not turned into yet another brainless talking head and retained some engineering skills.\n\nIMHO the cause of this constant dubious behavious of transformer LLM is pretty obvious, the transformer has **no intrinsic reward model or world model**.\n\nI.e. LLM doesn't \"understand\" the higher-order consequence that \"fixing A might break B.\" It only knows to maximize the probability of the next token given the immediate fine-tuning examples. And that's all.\n\nAlso, there's no architectural mechanism for **multi-objective optimization** or **trade-off reasoning** during gradient descent. The single Cross-Entropy loss on the new data is the only driver.\n\nThis sucks, alot. SOTA reasoning tries to compensate for this, but its always domain specific, thus creates gaps.",

It's more about  the underlying architecture's lack of mechanisms for the kind of reasoning I described.\n\nI.e. whether the driver is CE or a RL reward function, the transformer is ultimately being guided to produce a sequence of tokens that scores well **against** that specific, immediate objective.\n\nThis is why I see current SOTA reasoning methods as compensations, a crutch, an ugly one. Yep, as Deepsek had shown, these crutches can be brilliant and effective, but they are ultimately working around a core architectural gap rather than solving it from first principles.\n\nIMHO SSMs like Mamba and its successors could help here, by offering efficient long-context processing and a selective state mechanism. SSMs have their own pain points, yet these two SSM features would lay a foundation to  models that can genuinely weigh trade-offs during the act of generation, not just use SOTA crutches.",

HMMs, Viterbi decoding, n-gram smoothing, statistical methods that felt completely obsolete once Transformers took over.\n\nI left research in 2019 thinking my technical foundation was a sunk cost. Something to not mention in interviews.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe field circled back. The cutting-edge solutions to problems LLMs can't solve—efficient long-context modeling, structured output, model robustness—are built on the same principles I learned in 2015.\n\nA few examples:\n\n* **Mamba** (the main Transformer alternative) is mathematically a continuous Hidden Markov Model. If you understand HMMs, you understand Mamba faster than someone who only knows attention.\n* **Constrained decoding** (getting LLMs to output valid JSON) is the Viterbi algorithm applied to neural language models. Same search problem, same solution structure.\n* **Model merging** (combining fine-tuned models) uses the same variance-reduction logic as n-gram smoothing from the 1990s.\n\nI wrote a longer piece connecting my old research to current methods: \\[https://medium.com/@tahaymerghani/i-thought-my-nlp-training-was-obsolete-in-the-llm-era-i-was-wrong-c4be804d9f69?postPublishedType=initial\\]\n\nIf you're learning ML now, my advice: don't skip the \"old\" stuff. The methods change. The problems don't. Understanding probability, search, and state management will serve you longer than memorizing the latest architecture.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the research or the path.",

A simple bigram model with beam search is still the easiest and fastest way to get such a production level spelling correction in a specific domain. The responses are all under 10ms. I'm yet to measure the F1 score though, but so far it looks promising.\n\n\nOf course I can take a mini transformer and fine tune it for my domain, and I'll do it for fun, but having a quick baseline implementation is still valuable. ",

      "text": "This guide covers the 10 classical machine learning algorithms every fresher should learn. Each algorithm is explained with why it matters, how it works at a basic level, and when you should use it. By the end, you'll have a solid foundation to tackle real-world machine learning problems.\n\n**1. Linear Regression**\n\n**What it does:** Linear Regression models the relationship between input features and a continuous target value using a straight line (or hyperplane in multiple dimensions).\n\n**Why learn it:** This is the starting point for understanding machine learning mathematically. It teaches you about loss functions, gradients, and how models learn from data. Linear Regression is simple but powerful for many real-world problems like predicting house prices, stock values, or sales forecasts.\n\n**When to use it:** Use Linear Regression when you have a continuous target variable and suspect a linear relationship between features and the target. It's fast, interpretable, and works well as a baseline model.\n\n**Real example:** Predicting apartment rent based on square footage, location, and amenities.\n\n2. Logistic Regression\n\n**What it does:** Despite its name, Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm. It predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class, typically used for binary classification (yes/no, spam/not spam).\n\n**Why learn it:** Logistic Regression is everywhere in industry. It's used in fraud detection, email spam filtering, disease diagnosis, and customer churn prediction. Understanding it teaches you about probabilities, decision boundaries, and how to convert regression into classification.\n\n**When to use it:** Use it for binary classification problems where you need interpretable results and probability estimates. It's also a great baseline for classification tasks.\n\n**Real example:** Predicting whether a customer will buy a product (yes/no) based on their browsing history and demographics.\n\n3. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n\n**What it does**: KNN classifies data points based on the classes of their k nearest neighbors in the training dataset. If most neighbours belong to class A, the new point is classified as A.\n\n**Why learn it:** KNN is intuitive and teaches you about distance metrics (how to measure similarity between data points). It's a lazy learning algorithm, meaning it doesn't build a model during training but instead stores all training data and makes predictions at test time.\n\n**When to use it:** Use KNN for small to medium-sized datasets where you need a simple, interpretable classifier. It works well for image recognition, recommendation systems, and pattern matching.\n\n**Real example:** Recommending movies to a user based on movies watched by similar users.\n\n**4. Naive Bayes**\n\n**What it does:** Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes that all features are independent of each other (the \"naive\" assumption) and calculates the probability of each class given the features.\n\n**Why learn it:** Naive Bayes is fast, scalable, and surprisingly effective despite its simplistic assumptions. It's widely used in text classification, spam detection, and sentiment analysis. Understanding it teaches you about probability and Bayesian thinking.\n\n**When to use it:** Use Naive Bayes for text classification, spam detection, and when you need a fast, lightweight classifier. It works especially well with high-dimensional data like text.\n\n**Real example:** Classifying emails as spam or not spam based on word frequencies.\n\n**5. Decision Trees**\n\n**What it does:** Decision Trees make predictions by recursively splitting data based on feature values. Each split creates a branch, and the tree continues until it reaches a leaf node that makes a prediction.\n\n**Why learn it:** Decision Trees are highly intuitive and interpretable. You can visualize exactly how the model makes decisions. They also teach you about feature importance and how to handle both classification and regression problems.\n\n**When to use it:** Use Decision Trees when you need interpretability and can afford some overfitting. They work well for both classification and regression and handle non-linear relationships naturally.\n\n**Real example:** Deciding whether to approve a loan based on credit score, income, and employment history.\n\n**6. Random Forest**\n\n**What it does:** Random Forest combines multiple Decision Trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Each tree is trained on a random subset of data and features, and predictions are made by averaging (regression) or voting (classification) across all trees.\n\n**Why learn it:** Random Forest is powerful out-of-the-box and often works well without much tuning. It's one of the most popular algorithms in industry because it balances accuracy with interpretability. Understanding ensemble methods is crucial for modern machine learning.\n\n**When to use it:** Use Random Forest as your first choice for most classification and regression problems. It handles missing values, non-linear relationships, and feature interactions well.\n\n**Real example:** Predicting customer churn by combining predictions from multiple decision trees trained on different data subsets.\n\n**7. Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n\n**What it does:** SVM finds the optimal boundary (hyperplane) that separates classes by maximising the margin between them. It can also handle non-linear problems using kernel tricks.\n\n**Why learn it:** SVM has strong theoretical foundations and works exceptionally well for high-dimensional data. Understanding SVM teaches you about optimization, margins, and kernel methods—concepts that appear throughout machine learning.\n\n**When to use it:** Use SVM for binary classification problems, especially with high-dimensional data. It's particularly effective for text classification and image recognition.\n\n**Real example:** Classifying handwritten digits (0-9) in image recognition tasks.\n\n**8. k-Means Clustering**\n\n**What it does:** k-Means is an unsupervised algorithm that groups data points into k clusters based on similarity. It iteratively assigns points to the nearest cluster center and updates centers until convergence.\n\n**Why learn it:** k-Means introduces you to unsupervised learning and clustering concepts. It's simple, fast, and widely used for customer segmentation, image compression, and data exploration.\n\n**When to use it:** Use k-Means when you want to discover natural groupings in unlabeled data. It's great for exploratory data analysis and customer segmentation.\n\n**Real example:** Grouping customers into segments based on purchase behavior for targeted marketing.\n\n**9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**\n\n**What it does:** PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms features into a smaller set of uncorrelated components that capture most of the variance in the data.\n\n**Why learn it:** PCA teaches you about feature reduction, which is crucial for handling high-dimensional data. It helps with visualization, noise removal, and improving model performance by reducing computational complexity.\n\n**When to use it:** Use PCA when you have many features and want to reduce dimensionality while preserving information. It's useful for visualization, noise reduction, and speeding up model training.\n\n**Real example:** Reducing 784 pixel features in handwritten digit images to 50 principal components for faster classification.\n\n**10. Gradient Boosting (GBM)**\n\n**What it does:** Gradient Boosting builds models sequentially, where each new model corrects errors made by previous models. It combines weak learners (usually decision trees) into a strong predictor.\n\n**Why learn it:** Gradient Boosting is the foundation for modern tools like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost that dominate machine learning competitions and industry applications. Understanding it prepares you for state-of-the-art techniques.\n\n**When to use it:** Use Gradient Boosting for both classification and regression when you want maximum accuracy. It requires careful tuning but often produces the best results.\n\n**Real example:** Predicting house prices by sequentially building trees that correct previous prediction errors.\n\n",

I understand that these implementations are almost never used in real-world projects, and that libraries like scikit-learn are the standard. My motivation would be purely to gain a deeper understanding of how the algorithms actually work.\nOr is doing this a waste of time, and it’s enough to focus on understanding the algorithms mathematically and conceptually, without coding them from scratch?\nIf implementing them is considered important or beneficial, is it acceptable to use AI tools to help with writing the code, as long as I fully understand what the code is doing?",

      "text": "**TL;DR:**  \nThis course is dramatically overpriced, poorly designed for professionals, and far worse than alternatives that cost 1/20th as much.\n\n\n\n1. Inferior to far cheaper alternatives. I learned more in *two days* from Coursera / Stanford / Andrew Ng courses than from *an entire week* of this program, at \\~1/20th the cost.\n2. Nothing like MIT’s public 6.S191 lectures (the main reason people enroll). Those lectures are concept-driven and motivating; this course is rigid, procedural, and pedagogically shallow.\n3. Poorly designed and internally inconsistent. The course oscillates between advanced topics (Week 1: implement Gradient Descent) and trivial Python basics (Week 2: assign x = 2), signaling a lack of coherent instructional design and unclear audience definition.\n4. No stated prerequisites or pre-reading. Concepts appear with little context, leading to unnecessary frustration even in Week 1.\n5. Pedantic, inflexible module unlocking. Content is locked week-by-week with no option to work ahead; requests for flexibility were rejected with “this is how we do it,” which actively penalizes working professionals.\n6. Weak instructional design in core material. The ML history content is self-indulgent, poorly explained, and fails to answer “why this matters.”\n7. Poor UX that violates basic HCI principles. Nested scrolling frames, duplicated navigation controls, and unnecessary friction throughout the platform.\n\nBottom line:  \nIf you’re considering this because of the MIT name or the 6.S191 lectures, save your money. This course does not deliver value commensurate with its price.",

The hard decision-making still relies on deterministic or discriminative models (depends on the problem of course), and the generative side sits on top to explain, summarize, or present the result in a more human-friendly way. That setup gives you reliability in the core logic while still improving the UX and reducing the risk of hallucinations where correctness really matters.\n\nI put together a short breakdown of that trade-off using a real-world example, and I’d be curious to hear whether others have seen similar hybrid patterns in production ML.\n\n[https://blog.nastaran.ai/p/generative-ai-vs-discriminative-models](https://blog.nastaran.ai/p/generative-ai-vs-discriminative-models)",

If you can containerize your API, you’re 80% less lost.\n* Learn the “prod triangle”: logging + basic monitoring + error handling (structured logs, request time, retries/timeouts). This is what makes a demo feel “real.”\n* Add CI basics: GitHub Actions to run tests + linting on every push. Doesn’t need to be fancy, just consistent.\n* Then pick ONE hosting lane (don’t collect clouds): deploy the container to a managed service (e.g., a simple container hosting platform) before you touch Kubernetes.\n* Only after that: learn K8s if job posts in your area actually demand it. Most entry roles value “I can ship an API” more than “I can name 12 K8s objects.”\n* Portfolio tip: 2 small end-to-end projects beats 10 notebooks.

          "text": "You should not think about the whole algorithm at once, but rather the steps leading to it. Let's say you want to classify data into two categories. Drawing a linear decision boundary is a simple solution, but that's not always possible - your vector space might not have enough \"space\" to allow it.\n\n\nHow do you fix it? You embed your space into a higher-dimensional space, e.g. with a polynomial embedding. However, if your decision boundary is complex your polynomial embedding will get computationally expensive very quickly.\n\n\nWhat's the solution? You want to embed into an infinite-dimensional space with an inner product (a Hilbert Space), surely this will have enough \"space\" to draw any decision boundary you need. The key insight is that you don't need the whole (infinite-dimensional) vector of each data point for your calculations as the decision boundary is fully characterized by a an element of the dual space, e.g. (w, -) the dot product with a vector w. So it's enough for you to know how some (basis-)vectors interact in the inner product (since it is linear) and the Kernel matrix tells you exactly that. Of course one could embed the points differently into the Hilbert Space, this is what the different Kernels do.\n\n\nNow that you have enough space, how do you find such an optimal decision boundary? You formulate it as an optimization problem. You should probably think about how you would do this, as the problem arises quite naturally. For starters you can assume that there exists a clean decision boundary, e.g. all points can be linearly separated in the Hilbert Space. Then one could add a penalty term to allow for some points to be misclassified.\nThe resulting optimization problem can be solved directly, but there is a dual problem which has some nicer properties (even though both are convex), so you might want to look into that as well.\n\n\nI hope this helps and please do not be afraid of the complex concepts, it's not that bad once you have a hold of the basics (Linear Algebra, Optimization, maybe some Functional Analysis)! Good resources on the topic include sklearns documentation on the topic, as well as the relevant chapter from \"Elements of Statistical Learning\".\n\n\nIt's excellent that you're obsessed with the details and fully grasping everything, please never change that!",

In a 'winner takes all' type of a setup where only a few corporations will produce models, smaller companies will not have the data or the GPUs. The rest of us will simply just use these models and make agents or something similar.  \n\n  \nSo it is actually worth learning about how a neural network is built and how it is trained and get into the details of the loss curves and gradient descent?  Is this knowledge useful outside of big-tech?  If my understanding of the landscape is wrong then please provide me with some perspective. ",

In that case it seems like you may be better off investing your time to build the systems design skills for the kind of AI engineering that many companies are focused on these days. That doesn’t require a deep understanding of AI imo. However, if you want to develop a deep understanding of AI then of course you need to learn it.\n\nThat said, there are folks at my (not big tech) company who train models (LLMs and SLMs) in fine tuning circumstances. This is done in many contexts, some of which are industry specific but others could apply to many industries such as NLP to support our platform’s search functionality.\nOf course, if we consider applications of ML outside of LLMs, then the basics of model training are present all over the place. The fundamentals of optimization, loss functions, bias-variance, etc. are ever present.",

I've worked with PHDS brilliant in the mathematics that destroyed a promising company because they spent all their time chasing a perfect mathematical nueral network neglecting data, inference and pipeline.

Try to solve a problem with ML instead of focusing on the individual elements. \n\n\nSo make a dataset, annotate it, train a model (yolo is fun), do a couple revisions, then try a test deployment with QC. This process will teach you more about ML than an in depth analysis of the math. \n\n\nEssentially all models are data limited. Even the large LLMs now! This means the math can accommodate more data but we have none to give. So the math and model aren't limiting its how fast you can collect and annotate data. This has to be done in the real so is slow, costly and painful. \n\n\nIf I could buy 100 engineers 80 would be dataset collectors / annotaters / QC, 10, would be pipeline and infrastructure, 5 would be deployment, 5 would be model development. A major change in model can be revolutionary,  see transformers, but this is a Longshot once a decade thing. For a product brute force with off the shelf tools is usually the answer. ",

I sat through an academic talk recently where the speaker was saying that ML is transitioning into a “stage 3” development, where he defined “stage 1” as being foundational where people are all coming up with their own architectures, “stage 2” as being applied where there is a consensus on what architectures to be used (e.g. transformer based architectures) but individual groups would all be training their own models, to stage 3 where it makes the most sense to simply take a trained model (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) and then either fine-tune it or just use it as a tool on its own rather than trying to train it yourself. There is an analogy with the simulation tools used in physics and engineering like COMSOL or Ansys (if you are familiar with those). People used to write their own simulation code, but now it makes the most sense to just buy a license for existing supported frameworks. Circling back to your original question, does it make sense to understand the inner workings of ML models & architectures? Maybe not in your case, however personally I have always found it advantageous to understand what’s going on “under the hood” when troubleshooting things, in the same way that one can be a better software engineer if they also understand some of the computer architecture/hardware that is actually driving the whole process.",

I think these ideas are important to just know as part of the basis of your understanding, since “ML” really is just statistical learning and numerical optimization methods and you can’t get around that, but they shouldn’t really be intimidating.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\nI’m an undergrad CS student and I want to start learning ML properly, not just surface-level sklearn/Kaggle stuff. Long-term I’m interested in research (papers, maybe MS later), but in the short term I also want to be industry-relevant and understand how ML is actually used in real systems.\n\nI keep hearing that ML is best learned alongside strong fundamentals (math + theory) and by reading papers, but as a beginner it’s confusing to know where to start, what to ignore, and how deep to go. I’ve seen resources on Coursera/Udemy/YouTube/Kaggle, but I don’t want to just follow random tutorials or hype — I want a structured foundation.\n\nA few things I’m unsure about:\n\nShould I start with theory first (math, basics) or applications/projects?\n\nHow early should I start reading research papers, and how do you read them effectively as a beginner?\n\nWhat skills matter if I want to keep both research and industry ML paths open?\n\nCommon mistakes beginners make that I should avoid?\n\nI’ve also seen some people say that the “traditional path” (math-heavy + classic ML) is losing value because of LLMs/GenAI. I’ve also been curious about agentic AI and applied LLMs and wanted to learn that too for a while but where do they fit in for a beginner?\n\nWould appreciate guidance from people who are working in ML/research or have been through this path. Thanks!",

          "text": "with respect to papers, I’d say once you’ve gotten a fundamental grasp of and intuition for neural network optimization (and hopefully you’re reasonably familiar with linear algebra), then start reading some fundamental works of the past 10 years (CNN paper, autoencoders etc. are good places to start). I would recommend staying put in the supervised learning space for a while. \n\nInevitably you will not understand everything on these first read-throughs. That simply has to be accepted. It’s a tough balance, but you have to manage being confused about the details while also trying to extract intuitions. My recommendation is to occasionally try to map out a matrix-equation present in these papers using pen and paper (understanding the dimensions of each variable, what information is being passed and how). This should also be done for the neural net fundamentals (mapping forward passes, backpropagation, partial derivatives, etc.). \n\nIf you would like to then tow the line between LLM-applicable knowledge and ML theory, learn about autoregressive sequence to sequence models, then focus on the attention is all you need paper. Early NLP stuff in general. You can also generally push out to more advanced versions of the previous fundamental architectures (generative adversarial networks, variations autoencoders, and so on). \n\nAfter this kind of learning, you will notice that reading ML papers should be now much more accessible, though the confusion will likely still be there as most of these concepts are considered pre-requisite knowledge that the authors will assume you have. \n\nHopefully this helps. Not the only way, just closer to how I did it. Remember no pursuit of knowledge is ever a waste of time, and inevitably in retrospect you will realize that such and such would have been better to learn before some other thing and so on. What’s important is that you learned it at all. You have a lot of time to do this, so don’t get too caught up in the paralysis of starting ‘the right way’. Good luck!",

Again, it wasn't easy but it can be done. \n\nA lot of the people I worked with at the beginning had impressive sounding degrees, Masters in AI or Machine Learning, or whatever. However it turned out they learned a lot of things that didn't matter and didn't learn enough fundamentals. They couldn't perform ANOVA analysis, didn't know which kernel to use and couldn't explain the differences in AIC and BIC. \n\nWhatever degree you end up going for make sure that it is well grounded in Stats. Taking multiple classes on the principles and theory behind Regression might sound really boring compared to learning the math behind how neural networks operate but you will learn a lot of the fundamentals.",

While it’s a challenging shift that requires consistent effort, it is definitely a doable path with the right strategy.\n\nMy best advice for your 6–8 hour weekly window: Don’t just aim for a course certificate. Instead, look for a \"work-adjacent\" problem—like a manual data task or a repetitive bug-triage process at your current job—and try to build a small AI-based solution for it. Solving a real-world business problem with \"messy\" internal data is worth 10x more to a hiring manager than any generic tutorial project.\n\nI’ve been a self-learner for most of my 10+ years in AI (currently a Sr. Applied Scientist in Big Tech). I truly believe personalized paths beat fixed curriculums, especially for busy professionals. If you’re willing to put in the work, I’m happy to offer some guidance.

It uses manual backpropagation with a gradient check in the notebook.\n\nI built this to help myself visualize the gears of the architecture of a language model, and I hope it can be a useful reference for others too.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/dbrll/BareGPT\n\nI'd love to get your feedback on the implementation.",

      "text": "I am not really sure how to write this post. My first job was a dead-end data scientist job where I worked in a fintech startup and used python/sql to do a mix of:\n\n1. Managing quantitative finance products\n2. Not-that-useful-for-business-value unsupervised machine learning models that were run manually on an AWS compute instance with no MLOps\n3. Data pipelines for tableau dashboards/daily email reports\n4. Ad-hoc business analysis in notebooks\n\nIn my next job (with about a year of unemployment after the last one) I worked as a data scientist, but mostly did data engineering work and left after 6 months:\n\n1. Postgres and Airflow backend development\n2. Simple statistical models for analytics with SQL that were calculated in a tumbling-window\n\nI have always wanted to get a proper job in machine learning engineering, and I have some of the skills required (LLMs, simple neural networks/traditional ml, infrastructure, working with data, data engineering, MLOps system design, CI/CD) but don't have the advanced skills required for this job (eg: reinforcement learning, computer vision, GPU infrastructure, recommendation, forecasting, robotics/embedded systems) and the market for MLE/DS jobs is incredibly competitive.\n\nI have come to realize that **my work experience/education is inadequate to compete with other candidates in the incredibly competitive and high-compensation DS/MLE job market**. So, now I am trying to pivot to a full-stack AI engineer role where there is a greater emphasis on front-end and back-end web application development while having the responsibilities of an AI engineer to use existing models (Eg: LLMs, Multimodal models, Hugging face, fine-tuning) to design and create AI features.\n\nMy definition of MLE/AIE being:\n\n* MLE: Engineers who build their own models, create algorithms/advanced ML strategies to address business problems, have a strong academic background\n* AIE: Engineers who use existing foundation models to set up AI workflows, do not use advanced ML strategies (RL, CV, etc...) or develop algorithms, do not have a strong academic background\n\nI am simply unable to compete with others to get a pure ML/AI role, so my plan is to become a full-stack AI engineer so as to utilize my existing engineering skills (while learning more front-end), while not entirely wasting my skills in ML/AI. The academic requirements for a full-stack web dev position are lower, and this job market has more positions than ML/AI (albeit lower salary, but I just want to continue my career), so I think this is the best course of action I can take right now.\n\nIn order to a job like that, I am trying to position myself as a full-stack engineer **who is willing to understand the product/business and knows how to use AI models to design features in to can create tangible value for the company**. This might be a tall order, but it's the best plan I have right now to revive my career which has been slowly dying, and I am open to any ideas/suggestions that may help. Thank you in advance.\n\nI am currently working on a project that will hopefully get me considered for AI/full-stack engineer jobs. It is a multi-agent system that integrates with a hypothetical CRM system to responds to customer support emails by understanding the content of the email, categorising it into an appropriate action category (e.g., escalate, flag, response, etc), and taking whatever actions are necessary (e.g., checking transactions/claims/statuses, etc...) to address the support request in that category. Then the agent prepares a response to the email with a list of actions taken and contextual data gathered from internal systems, for staff to manually review before sending it to the client. This interface for staff is accessible through an authenticated front-end which displays the details of the customer support case, the actions taken by the agent, and the email response that the agent has prepared.",

      "text": "I’m a recent bachelor's grad from a top CS school and I majored in data science. I applied to some master’s programs because it makes sense for the data science industry. Currently I’m working as a data scientist. \n\nI'm very lucky to have gotten into UPenn’s data science master’s program and GT OMSCS, both are online and part time, but I’m torn between the two. The main reason why I’m hesitant about penn is because some people have told me that a CS master’s would be more complementary to my DS bachelors degree. My manager mentioned that it would be beneficial to learn how to write production code and be able to deploy models, and these are skills I might be able to get with a CS masters.\n\nAnother hesitation I have is that UPenn's curriculum appears to overlap (around 30–40%) with courses I took at my undergrad, but I can also see value in refreshing my memory on those topics. On the pro side, UPenn’s reputation is slightly higher than GT in general (not in tech). I’m not 100% sure if I want to stay in tech, so I feel like going for the more prestigious school would be a safer option. Penn only costs 20k for me after employer reimbursement, and my WLB would not be killed because the curriculum is less rigorous than OMSCS.\n\nI personally did not like the data structures class at my undergrad, so I have a feeling that I probably don’t like CS/SWE very much. However, I have heard about DS jobs turning into MLE or data analyst jobs, so I might need CS skills to prepare for the transition to an more senior MLE job. Given all of this, I would really value your perspective. For someone who plans to stay primarily in the data science field, which program would you say is the better choice? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

Some do, not sure about UPenn, only briefly looked at it online. I do know some people who have done some ML courses at the GT program and found it helpful. A current coworker of mine attends the part time online for this program. We work as MLE’s and they say it does cover lots of the basics. \n\nI always think it’s good for MLE’s to be able to understand production level code even if you do not want to be a SWE. GT would be beneficial for this and would also bring in some new concepts that are potentially valuable as DS / MLE. From what I hear the program is kinda what you make of it. If you have no interest at all in software stick to UPenn though. From my experience lots of roles in ML lately seem to require a strong foundations of DS + ML + CS. \n\nI would say GT based on what my colleagues and friends have said. It is also a very well known and respected program. Either way both are great and congrats on your acceptances!",

              "text": "Thank you so much for your advice! \n\nI would say that my current job requires me to do a lot of ML modeling to gain business insights, but not to productionize the model. I really enjoy building complex models and neural networks, but I’m not really sure if I want to move towards a more MLE oriented role, because I heard that it’s more about being a SWE than a data scientist. I had a really miserable experience taking the data structures and algorithms class at my undergrad. I was literally crying before every exam lol, but I’m not sure if it was because I just dislike computers or that class was just too hard and overwhelming (everybody found it really hard). What I know I didn’t like was not having any free time and coding all day. I understand a CS degree might keep more doors open, but I’m not sure if I’m willing to make that sacrifice in time and mental health 😭\n\nI think my main goal with this master’s program is to check off the box when applying to new ds jobs, since they all seem to require one these days. Of course I want to learn new things too, but I’m also afraid of burning out and potentially have this negatively impact my performance at work, especially since I just started working at this company. I think a workload difference of 5+ hours per week is still significant especially when it’s over 3-4 years. \n\nSince I’m not really excited by software, I was thinking maybe I can do UPenn first, then enroll in OMSCS for some extra learning but not necessarily to graduate. Would you say this plan can also help me keep my doors open for ML roles, if I do end up wanting to transfer in the future?",

However I do find it rare for a data science undergrad and grad graduate to become SWE / MLE oriented roles (though not unheard of) just not very typically. Data science and software skills are very different, which is usually why a degree would be a way for you to build those skills. I don’t think UPenn closes that door to pivot but GT program would certainly make it easier for you to pivot down the line. Both will certainly help though!",

For actual ML/AI stuff the trick is going from “what it is” to “how it works in code,” so things with notebooks and real projects matter more than just theory videos. \n\nAndrew Ng’s ML and DL courses are solid for fundamentals, and Krish Naik / CampusX are fine for building practical intuition and seeing things implemented end to end. For a roadmap I’d think basics first (linear models, loss functions, gradient descent), then move to neural nets/deep learning, and after that RL/GenAI once you’ve shipped a few smaller projects. When you start practicing interview stuff it helps to do actual coding problems with feedback, check out [interview questions](https://www.interviewquery.com/questions?searchQuery=&searchQuestionTag=&searchCompany=&positions=data-analyst&positions=data-scientist&completed=&saved=&ordering=relevancy&orderingDirection=asc&pageSize=20&page=0), and do mock interview tools that make sure you can explain your ML/AI code and concepts out loud, not just know them in theory.",

Whats your background in mathematics? Strengthening your knowledge in Discrete Mathematics will be a great ROI for both ML and Cybersecurity. \n\nFrom what I know, and based on my limited experience (which may be different from others who comment on here) the best short term path would be to get meaningful employment in one of the three areas now, and take courses (either self learning through courses like Coursera or through formal education such as a Grad Cert) to get formal qualifications in another field if you are more passionate about it (e.g get a Web dev role now, and study ML part time later if you find that is your \"true calling\") \n\nI just think when asking for opinions for a topic like this, where tailored advice based on your situation is important,  it could be beneficial to add more details on your current experience.",

It has reduced the barrier of entry to Web Development.\n\nDoes this mean that Web developers are no longer useful? No. Does it mean they can make Web applications of higher quality and reliability then you can? Probably not. But what it does mean, is that freelancers in Web development have less clients for 2 reasons. 1) more CS graduates (and really anyone) feel empowered to become Web developers and 2) people that would have been potential clients are now using these tools to build their own applications. \n\nWith ML and Cybersecurity, usually formal education is valued unless you have a very good reason for them to look past it. Whether this is through self driven projects or work placements. Getting a good data entry/ junior data science internship/graduate position could be a good start for ML, whereas security consulting could be a good start to Cybersecurity but it will most likely need to wait until after you have completed your undergraduate degree to join a graduate program.\n\nIf getting into Cybersecurity,  there are certs you could benefit from getting (but there can be costs to doing so, make sure you are commited to Cybersecurity before investing in this) such as CompTIA certs or ISC2 \n\nFor now, I would say focus on your degree, and apply for entry roles in the areas that interests you. Unless an opportunity presents itself your formal education or a job placement will have the most impact in entering the field. Of course do not dismiss your self-learning , as you will benefit from this in the long term.",

I have developed a good interest in machine learning due to my love towards maths. \n\nGoal: Data Scientist Position\n\nBesides this, I m grinding DSA, and doing development too. Note that I am not that much pro in both these fields. So, to be consistent in my ML journey, I want a study partner, who is facing similar situation. Also, if that person is of my age(20), it is a plus point. \n\nNow, let me tell you where I am in learning ML.\n\nResources: Following Siddhardhan's ML Playlist of 60 hours\n\nTools: Using Google Colab, Notion, and saving everything on GitHub.\n\nCurrent Progress: Have completed the first lecture, and one small project recently. \n\nWhat do I expect from u?\n\n- To give daily updates, what did I and you learnt. \n- To clear some small doubts of each other, give some suggestions, etc. \n- Most important: I am that type of person who once make connections, become transparent. I mean nothing to hide, and suggest everything that I find useful. I really want that from u. \n\nWhat u can expect from me?\n\nJust one word, complete transparency. [Only if u are!] \n\nI could feel rude to u from this post, but I am not that in reality. Just love to say everything what I want. 🙂\n\nWaiting in dms.",

I tried to keep the code very simple and beginner-friendly, focusing on understanding the *Attention Is All You Need* paper rather than optimization or using high-level libraries. Before this, I’ve covered classical ML and deep learning (CNNs, RNNs). After working through Transformers, I’ve become interested in AI/ML infrastructure, especially inference-side topics like attention internals, KV cache, and systems such as vLLM. I wanted to ask if moving toward AI infrastructure makes sense at this stage, or if I should spend more time building and experimenting with models first. I’ve shared my implementation here for feedback: [**https://github.com/Ryuzaki21/transformer-from-scratch**](https://github.com/Ryuzaki21/transformer-from-scratch). Any advice would be really appreciated",

Infrastructure work benefits a lot from having built models yourself, because concepts like KV cache or batching tradeoffs feel much more concrete once you have wrestled with attention math and shapes. You do not need to choose one forever either. A good middle ground is to take a simple model you understand and then focus on how inference changes when you care about latency, memory, and throughput. That way you are still grounded in modeling, but you are asking systems questions instead of architectural ones. A lot of strong infra folks followed a similar path, curiosity about why things get slow or expensive usually pulls you there naturally.",

Users needs to sign-up somewhere.... this means you need a website. boom there is your company - or at least the tech stack of a small business ;-)\n\ncloud and kubernetes is scale-out. If you build something that does work and that people are willing to pay for how do I make this stuff scale stable from 1 to 10\\_000 users? \n\nThis \"problem\" is why companies usually seek a whole IT department. Doing all this all alone is tough and you need quite a lot of experience and building before you are even able to build the full vertical stack yourself.\n\nMy opinion is you do not need to be able to build this all by yourself to make a successful ML model but you will be pushed down this route almost automatically as the one request leads to next requirement.",

Get a job. I build and deploy AI based systems for a living. There is software in the world that uses ML components I made but I achieved this by just going to work and doing my job not through any incredible capability to come up with useful applications for AI.\n\nThe problem for people in this sub is that entry level jobs are very hard to come by these days and if you're self-taught, you kind of need to be coming from a solid STEM education background to compete in the market.\n\n\nThe second is... Build a product. By which I mean, identify a need people have that could be met by software and build a full solution that meets that need for those people.\n\nThis gives solo ML learners two problems: you want an ML project so have to select on that before picking a useful project. Second, without the broader team that would back you making a product in industry, you need to find a useful complete package that only needs things you can build. You have to either be some pseudo-fullstack engineer or find the rare problem that can be solved by a python script that does some ML.",

Later on we might replace the simple math to using UniDepth.\n\n  \nthis is how I plan to currently build my first prototype, I do wanna try and bring to like Waymo / Tesla's End-to-End approach where we have a model that can still drive between lessons by doing path planning. i mean i have thought of somehow bring the whole model of  the floor to a virtual env and try to RL the model to handle like crowds. not sure if i have enough compute / data / not that good of a programmer to do that.\n\nany feedback welcome! please help me out for anything that you think I might got wrong / can improve.",
