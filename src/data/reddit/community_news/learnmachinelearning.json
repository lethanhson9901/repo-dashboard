      "text": "Every time someone asks \"Should I learn TensorFlow in 2026?\" the comments are basically a funeral. The answer is always a resounding \"No, PyTorch won, move on.\"\n\nBut if you actually look at what the Fortune 500 is hiring for, TensorFlow is essentially the Zombie King of ML. It’s not \"winning\" in terms of hype or GitHub stars, but it’s completely entrenched.\n\nI think we’re falling into a \"Research vs. Reality\" trap.\n\nLook at academia; PyTorch has basically flatlined TF. If you’re writing a paper today in TensorFlow, you’re almost hurting your own citation count.\n\nThere’s also the Mobile/Edge factor. Everyone loves to hate on TF, but TF Lite still has a massive grip on mobile deployment that PyTorch is only just starting to squeeze. If you’re deploying to a billion Android devices, TF is often still the \"safe\" default.\n\nThe Verdict for 2026: If you’re building a GenAI startup or doing research, obviously use PyTorch. Nobody is writing a new LLM in raw TensorFlow today.\n\nIf you’re stuck between the “PyTorch won” crowd and the “TF pays the bills” reality, this breakdown is actually worth a read: [**PyTorch vs TensorFlow**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-enterprise-guide)\n\nAnd if you’re operating in a Google Cloud–centric environment where TensorFlow still underpins production ML systems, this structured [**Google Cloud training**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/vendor/google-cloud-training) programs can help teams modernize and optimize those workloads rather than just maintain them reactively.\n\nIf your organization is heavily invested in Google Cloud and TensorFlow-based pipelines, it may be less about “abandoning TF” and more about upskilling teams to use it effectively within modern MLOps frameworks.",

They need it enough that they have community colleges train people in COBOL today. One guy I know trained for C++ game development ended up in COBOL. Would he be as likely to be hired for TF with basic, coding skills?\n\nI think there couod be an argument that COBOL and TF are both expensive solutions to one's problems. Expensive if you consider most COBOL users are stuck on proprietary implementations on mainframes. One generates vastly more revenue, though.",

While TensorFlow had first-mover advantage and strong corporate backing, PyTorch's intuitive API design truly resonates with researchers and practitioners. The dynamic computation graphs make rapid experimentation so much smoother.\n\n\n\nWhat's interesting is that TensorFlow's complexity isn't accidental—it was built for scale and production systems. But the learning curve has become a significant barrier, especially for students and small teams. The fact that you can build and debug PyTorch models so much faster now means more innovation happens in that ecosystem.\n\n\n\nFor enterprise deployments and legacy systems, TensorFlow will likely persist (like COBOL!), but for cutting-edge research and startups, PyTorch is clearly the default choice now. Great breakdown of the technical and business factors at play here.",

That's not a technical problem; it's a business moat.\n\n\n\nBut here's what's interesting: PyTorch isn't \"winning\" because it's better code-wise.

Come down to meet the school bus with the dogs, wiggling his fat little ass like he had a tail.\n\nMom didn't like it-he'd grab your pant cuff and play fight tug, ripped all our pants to shreds \n\nMorning the dogs knew all cattle were being group herded, ( loading , or moving pasture rotation )  late afternoon cutting,  prep to group herd in morning.\n\nLonger range cattle drive horses , dog assist.  Ten miles ( north quarter by river was ten miles away ) or 5 miles ( mid point pasture ).\n\nWe had  40 horses, 300 cattle, chickens  pigs ( chickens and pigs have to be widely separated , disease transmission ) , got rid of the sheep ( they chew the pasture down closer to the ground than cattle or horses, hard on the grass ). \n\nHad goats, but they were like teenagers at the mall, just go wherever the hell they want .\n\n5 dairy cows, two of the dogs thought they were bringing them in every day at five pm , but the dairy cows knew to come in, go right to their own milking stall.  The dogs were just really going for a one mile walk with them.\n\nIf you keep all the animals as tame as possible, they are a lot easier to control.   Same as being polite to people.\n\nMost of the horses were arabs, most neck reined out really well.  Only the stallion needed a bit, the rest hackamores or halter ride if feeling lazy.   \n\nIf some cows got out, heading to trample the wheat,  could jump on almost any horse bareback, and neck rein with just your palms.\n\nSend the dog ahead to turn them until you got on  a horse.\n\n3 out of five dogs were ok at cutting, ( need to spend a lot of time to get dogs as well trained as the video , we didn't, but they were ok at it   ) 2 dogs were just guard duty, coyotes, loose livestock alarm.\n\nThe badger slept in the barn with the dogs, he found a girlfriend and wandered away after 3 years.",

None of them made a dollar. not a single transaction.\n\nhere's each one with the real numbers.\n\n***app 1: churn predictor for saas companies***\n\nI built it with fastapi for the backend, scikit-learn for the initial model, railway for hosting. took about 3 weeks.\n\nusers: 12 signups. 0 paid. 3 people actually uploaded data. the feedback i got was that they didn't trust a tool they found randomly online with their user data. fair.\n\nwhat killed it: i posted once on X, got 40 views, moved on. never figured out how to actually reach saas founders.\n\n***app 2: resume screener for small hiring teams***\n\nI built it with python, a basic nlp pipeline, claude api for the actual ranking logic, deployed on railway. took 2 weeks.\n\nusers: 31 signups. 0 paid. about 8 people tried it. feedback was that it felt risky to make hiring decisions with an ai tool they found on product hunt.\n\nwhat killed it: launched on product hunt on a tuesday. got 40 upvotes. disappeared. never figured out distribution at all.\n\n***app 3: customer segmentation tool***\n\nthe idea: give small e-commerce stores the kind of customer segmentation that big companies have.\n\nthis one i actually put more work into. used heyneo to handle the ml pipeline which made building it way faster. [heyneo.so](http://heyneo.so) dealt with the data preprocessing, model training and the output formatting. frontend was built with lovable. also deployed on railway. took about 3 weeks including testing.\n\nusers: 8 signups. 0 paid. 2 people actually ran a segmentation. one said it was cool but they didn't know what to do with the segments. that one stung because i thought the output was useful.\n\nwhat killed it: literally zero marketing. posted in one subreddit, got 3 upvotes, gave up too early.\n\n***app 4: content performance predictor***\n\nthe idea: paste your blog post or social content, get a score predicting how it'll perform based on patterns from high performing content.\n\nusers: 67 signups. 0 paid. most people used it once and left. the predictions were probably not accurate enough to be useful and i had no way to validate them.\n\nwhat killed it: product was probably not good enough honestly. this one might have deserved to die.\n\n**So I decided to test another way:** I was reading posts here and in freelance community and started noticing people getting ml clients through reddit. not posting their products but just being helpful in comments, answering questions, sharing knowledge. people would dm them asking for help.\n\ntried it. spent a few weeks just being useful in data science and ml subreddits. got my first dm about 3 weeks in. someone needed a customer segmentation model for their email campaigns.\n\nquoted them $2,200. they said yes.\n\ndelivered it in about 5 days using the same stack i'd used for app 3, neo for the ml pipeline, fastapi for the api layer, railway for deployment. client was happy. referred me to someone else.\n\nA second client came from that referral. $3,800 for a churn prediction model.\n\n**Made more in 6 weeks of freelancing than 8 months of trying to build products.**\n\nI currently have 3 active clients and a couple more in the pipeline. averaging somewhere around $8k to $10k per month now depending on the month. planning to go full time on this by end of year.\n\n**Current stack for freelance work:** **Heyneo** for ml pipeline automation, **fastapi** for api layer, **railway** for deployment, **perplexity** for research when i need to understand a new domain fast, claude for documentation and client communication drafts.\n\nhappy to answer questions about the freelancing side or the failed apps. also curious if anyone has actually figured out distribution for ml tools because i never did.",

Also, building a tool, without first knowing they’re solving a current and persistent problem that needs solving by a defined set of users who feel their problem is bad enough to pay for a solution, will usually fail immediately. \n\nI work in the IT industry but I’m building a tool now in the real estate industry. To ensure I’m building the right tool for the right target user, I went and became the target user. So I quit my high paying IT job and became a low paid real estate agent and worked there until I ran out of money. In that year I learnt all about the industry and validated my idea and flushed out the full development roadmap. \n\nThen went back to my IT job to work for a while to repay the crippling debt I racked up working as an agent because I didn’t have savings to actually take this action. Now the debt is paid off and a MVP is almost complete. I’m busy with the deployment environment now, so soon I should be able to launch. \n\nSeeing I made friends in the industry I already have a contact list of people to offer to try out the product and give feedback on the MVP. I’ll just offer it to a small subset of people first to prove my concept and polish the solution. Once I apply the recommendations from that feedback, then I can expand to more people in my contact list. \n\nEven with all this work over a few years I still don’t know if I’ll success. \n\nNotice my focus is more on what the solution is and who’s going to use it and not the tool itself? The stack I chose ended up being informed by the solution requirements more than my thoughts on cool tech. I barely know the stack and entirely use AI to build it. \n\nI dunno, Business is hard man. I think it’s mostly luck: right place at the right time and you just so happen to have learnt a stack of skills that are suddenly all applicable in that moment. \n\nSo keep trying, you may get lucky. But make your efforts informed by the paying target user more than just building cool stuff.",

          "text": "Really enjoyed reading this, especially the way you framed maze solving as image segmentation rather than classical pathfinding. Generating 500k synthetic maze/solution pairs and pushing a U-Net to learn the mapping is a very clean experimental setup. The fact that it performs strongly up to 64x64 suggests it has genuinely internalised a lot of local path structure rather than just memorising patterns.\n\nI've approached maze solving from the opposite direction. Instead of learning the mapping, I model the maze explicitly as a graph:\n\nCells as vertices\nOpen passages as edges\nExplicit frontier / explored sets\n\nFrom there I use DFS, BFS, and A* with admissible heuristics (Manhattan for grids, cube distance for hex). So the solver is symbolic and deterministic. Optimality is guaranteed under the usual conditions (BFS for unweighted graphs, A* with admissible heuristic), and scaling behaviour is predictable: O(V+E).\n\nWhat's interesting is that your scaling limit around 127x127 makes perfect sense from a structural perspective.\n\nA CNN-based U-Net has:\n\nStrong local inductive bias (convolutions capture neighbourhood structure well)\nWeak global state representation\nNo explicit frontier expansion or path memory\n\nSo at small/medium sizes, it can approximate \"flow along corridors\" because that behaviour is locally consistent. But once the maze requires multi-stage global reasoning (long-range dependencies, dead-end propagation, or path decisions that depend on distant structure) the network has to simulate something like a search algorithm implicitly inside its activations. Convolutions are not naturally suited to that unless you add mechanisms for global context (attention, recurrence, or explicit graph structure).\n\nIn contrast, a graph search algorithm scales because it explicitly maintains state: frontier ordering, backtracking stack, accumulated cost, etc. It does not need to infer traversal logic; it executes it.\n\nThat said, I do not see your approach as competing with classical algorithms. It is answering a different question: can a neural network internalise algorithmic reasoning from data?\n\nIn that sense, the wall you're hitting is a very informative result rather than a failure. It is highlighting the boundary between local pattern recognition and structured multi-step reasoning.\n\nIf you wanted to push further, architectures that inject structural bias might help, e.g. graph neural networks, neural A* variants, attention layers that allow global communication, or iterative refinement steps that simulate expansion. A pure segmentation network is fighting its own inductive bias at larger scales.\n\nOverall, this is a thoughtful experiment and very cleanly executed. It's especially interesting that you used DFS to generate the ground truth, so in a way, the model is trying to approximate a classical algorithm without being given the algorithm itself.\n\nCurious to see how far you can push it with structural modifications.",

If you want to avoid the 'vibe-coded' platforms that just ask high-level theory, you should definitely check out TensorTonic.\n\nIt’s seriously impressive because it actually forces you to write tensor-level code (PyTorch/NumPy style) rather than just answering multiple-choice questions. It’s the closest thing I’ve found to a true 'LeetCode for ML' implementation.\nCheck it out here: https://www.tensortonic.com/\n\nOther solid alternatives:\n- Deep-ML: Great for fundamental matrix math.\n- MLStack: Better for system design and end-to-end pipelines.\n\nIf you’re prepping for interviews where you have to implement a layer or a loss function from scratch, TensorTonic is probably your best bet right now.",

My general rule of thumb goes like this:\n\nIf your data fits in your RAM (like, under 10GB), just stick to Pandas. It’s the industry standard for a reason and handles the vast majority of normal tasks.\n\nIf you're dealing with a bit more; say 10GB to 100GB; give Polars a try. It’s way faster, handles memory much better, and you still don't have to mess around with setting up a cluster.\n\nYou really only need Apache Spark if you're actually dealing with terabytes of data or legitimately need to distribute your computing across multiple machines.\n\nThere's no need to optimize prematurely. You aren't \"less of an ML engineer\" just because you used Pandas for a 500MB dataset. You're just being efficient and saving everyone a headache.\n\nIf you're curious about when Spark actually makes sense in a real production environment, I put together a guide breaking down real-world use cases and performance trade-offs: [**Apache Spark**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/apache-spark)\n\nBut seriously, does anyone else feel like \"Big Data\" tools get pushed way too hard on beginners who just need to learn the basics first?",

You can skip Flask, Django, and the web dev ones entirely, they're great courses, but they won't help you with ML and you'll burn weeks on a tangent.\n\nOnce you're comfortable reading Python (loops, functions, classes, list comprehensions), jump straight to ML. Don't wait until you've finished the whole playlist. Here's what to move to:\n\nFree video courses:\n- Andrej Karpathy's \"Neural Networks: Zero to Hero\" (YouTube) — builds neural networks from scratch, teaches you ML-relevant Python as you go\n- 3Blue1Brown's neural networks series — short, visual, makes the math click\n\nFree books:\n- \"The Little Book of Deep Learning\" by Fleuret — 170 pages, free PDF, covers the whole field concisely\n\nLearn by reading real code:\n- I put together 30 single-file Python implementations of core ML algorithms — no frameworks, no dependencies, just Python. Each script is heavily commented so it reads like a tutorial. Good for seeing how Python is actually used to build ML, not just toy exercises: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/s/G0qj2zAEdw\n\nHands-on practice (free):\n- Kaggle — free beginner courses + competitions + free compute\n- Google Colab — free GPU for running notebooks\n\nBiggest mistake I see: spending months perfecting Python before ever writing ML code. You'll learn more Python in one week of building a neural network from scratch than in a month of general Python tutorials. Get the basics down, then dive in.",

      "text": "Over the past four months, I’ve been interviewing for Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) and Applied Scientist (AS) roles. While preparing, I realized that high-quality, relevant resources are actually quite limited, so I wanted to share my own experience here. I’ll probably break this down into 2 or 3 posts. This is Part 1.\n\n>\n\nFor context, out of Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, TikTok, Pinterest, Airbnb, and Netflix—excluding the company I currently/previously worked for (\\~5 YOE in ML)—I interviewed at the rest. I received offers from all but one. The exact titles vary slightly depending on the company (MLE / Applied Scientist / Data Scientist - Modeling Track), but for the sake of this post, I will just refer to all of them as MLE.\n\nWhen preparing for MLE interviews, you generally need to focus on a few key areas:\n\n# 1. Coding\n\nPreparing for this is not fundamentally different from standard Software Development Engineer (SDE) coding prep. You need to grind LeetCode. Some companies will require your code to compile, and you'll either need to write your own test cases or pass pre-written ones.\n\nStandard best practices apply here (which you can find in any SWE interview guide):\n\n* **Ask clarification questions:** Are there memory constraints? What is the input range/format?\n* **Communicate:** Discuss your high-level approach and data structures with the interviewer *before* writing a single line of code.\n* **Structure:** Have a clear mental outline of what each block of your code is doing.\n* **Iterate:** If you can't think of the most optimal approach immediately, start with a brute-force working solution and then optimize it.\n\n**The MLE Twist:** What makes coding slightly different for MLEs is that some companies have dedicated \"ML Coding\" rounds or ask more mathematically inclined questions. For example, you might be asked to design a sparse matrix (including addition, subtraction, multiplication). This requires you to actually understand how matrix operations work under the hood.\n\nSome companies might even ask you to implement a specific algorithm from scratch (like kNN or k-means) or use a Deep Learning framework to implement a basic model, like Transformer matrix operations (though this is less common). **My advice:** For the most common interview questions, I was able to find them on [PracHub](https://prachub.com/)\n\n\n\n# 2. ML System Design\n\nThis is the biggest differentiator between SDE and MLE interviews. Almost every company will have one or two rounds dedicated to this.\n\nGenerally, you will be asked to design a solution for a real-world use case. Common examples include: *How would you design the YouTube recommendation system?* or *Design the DoorDash search box / auto-suggestion feature.* Because these questions have high ambiguity and rely heavily on practical experience, they are very difficult to bluff your way through.\n\nHere is how I suggest preparing:\n\n# A. Daily Accumulation (Hands-on Experience)\n\nIf you have hands-on experience building end-to-end ML projects (defining the problem, finding features, modeling, offline evaluation, online deployment, monitoring, iteration, etc.), you are already halfway there. Regardless of the specific ML domain you are asked about, the overarching architectural framework is largely the same; you are just plugging in different components.\n\nIf you lack ML product experience, you should at least have offline model-building experience, and then supplement that by reading engineering blogs from tech companies (like Pinterest or Airbnb) to build your product sense.\n\nThis \"accumulation\" really shows during follow-up questions. For instance, in an NLP app, they might ask how you'd handle extremely long text inputs. For a recommendation app, they might ask how you'd conduct counterfactual evaluation. You build a sense for these answers by following the state-of-the-art (SOTA), reading papers, attending conferences, and listening to talks. This is hard to cram for.\n\n# B. Prep Materials\n\n* **Courses:** If you have very little practical experience, look into *ML System Design* on Educative or *Grokking the Machine Learning Interview*. This will at least give you a baseline framework (e.g., knowing that \"Search\" is split into Information Retrieval and Ranking). If you already have solid CV/NLP/Search/RecSys experience, these courses might be too basic for you.\n* **Engineering Blogs:** Read company blogs to understand the exact types of problems they face and how they solve them.\n* **YouTube:** Good videos are rare, but they exist. For example, \\[this talk\\] is pretty solid.\n\n# C. Read Papers\n\nFor someone who already has a habit of reading research papers, there is no faster way to prepare. A good applied research paper tells a complete story: Problem -> Features -> Methodology -> Evaluation -> Online Results. **This is exactly the flow of an ML Design interview.** The list of \"must-read\" classic papers is actually quite short:\n\n* **Recommendation/Search (Most common):** *Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations*. If you only have time to read one paper, eat, sleep, and breathe this one.\n* **Auto-completion:** *Gmail Smart Compose: Real-Time Assisted Writing*.\n* **Option Generation:** *Smart Reply: Automated Response Suggestion for Email*.\n* **Ranking/Personalization:** Airbnb has several excellent papers on this.\n\n# D. My Preferred Framework for Answering\n\nWhen tackling an ML Design question, I like to follow this structure:\n\n1. **Ask Clarification Questions:** \\* *What is the stage of the project?* (If it's early stage, you must address the cold-start problem).\n   * *What is the traffic volume?* (This impacts your engineering robustness and latency considerations).\n   * *Can I assume standard data is logged?* (Usually yes, but always double-confirm).\n2. **Draw the High-Level Architecture:** Set up the standard \"cookie-cutter\" structure. Briefly describe the main components:\n   * **Online:** Data (online user data + database fetches), ML Service, ML Model Artifact, Logging, and Monitoring.\n   * **Offline:** Feature processing, Modeling, Evaluation.\n   * *Tip:* I highly recommend drawing this out for the interviewer. Since most of my interviews were remote, I had an iPad ready to draw the architecture live. It shows you are highly organized, and when you dive into the details, the interviewer knows exactly which component you are talking about.\n3. **Deep Dive into Implementation:**\n   * **Features:** Brainstorm what data you need. For recommendations, this is usually split into: *Document features* (views, text/video embeddings), *User features* (gender, geo-location **\\[super important for local search\\]**, watch/search history), and *Interaction features* (distance, previously clicked/watched, matched text). You must know how to handle non-numerical data using text/image/ID embeddings.\n   * **Modeling (The Meat):** Frame the problem first (Is this regression? Classification? Ranking?). How do you encode the inputs? What is the model architecture (e.g., for ranking: bi-encoder vs cross-encoder vs poly-encoder; for RecSys: two-tower)? Compare the pros and cons of different models (LR vs Random Forest; LSTM vs Transformer). Finally, how do you choose your loss function?\n   * **Evaluation:** Know the standard offline metrics (Accuracy, AUC, F1, Precision/Recall, MSE) and NLP-specific metrics (Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore).\n   * **The Rest:** You usually won't spend too much time here, but touch on how different data is stored and how the data pipeline is designed.\n\nThe rest of the interview depends entirely on what specific areas the interviewer wants to drill into—and that relies on your deep knowledge. For example, how do you handle a search for restaurant chains? How do you handle exploratory search (e.g., \"movies for family\")? What if you have very little data? This is where you can start discussing Knowledge Graphs, Active Learning, Reinforcement Learning, GANs, etc.",

But I was always left with this nagging feeling of *why* — why does it have this specific form? Where does it actually come from?\n\nSo I wrote the explanation I wish had existed when I was studying it. Rather than presenting the SVD as a given formula, the article builds it up from scratch by asking: what problem are we actually trying to solve? It turns out the answer to that question naturally leads you to the SVD formula, step by step, without any magic.\n\nThe key idea is that symmetric matrices have a superpower — they can always be diagonalized, and their eigenbasis is always orthogonal. The SVD is essentially the answer to the question: *what if we could have that for any matrix, not just symmetric ones?*\n\nIf you've ever felt that the standard textbook presentation left something to be desired, I hope this fills that gap. Feedback very welcome — especially if something is unclear or could be explained better.\n\nLink: [https://markelic.de/deriving-the-singular-value-decomposition-svd-from-first-principles/](https://markelic.de/deriving-the-singular-value-decomposition-svd-from-first-principles/)",

I wasn’t trained on this either. It just feels like the education pipeline is lagging hard.\n\nSome of our senior staff has suggested we hire based on development experience and then we could do inhouse training on secure AI development and testing, but I'm not sure if thats the best approach to go with. \n\nFor folks here - did anyone learn AI security formally?

Maybe it’s because I work in defense, but these have always been a real concern. I get in business someone poisoning a model is relatively little risk, but that’s more of an incentive problem than model risk doesn’t exist. In defense, if your system fails means people could die, and you always have someone trying to gain some form of information dominance over you. \n\nI do agree that this has been seen as important now since GenAI is so trivially easy to attack compared to having to find sensors traditional ML relied on. The fact that these frontier models are being constantly being push out of alignment makes them a huge risk in my mind, but again the incentive for making money somehow overweighs this risk.",

Right now you have to manually add controls points to scale, rotate and move the cad drawing into position over the building footprint. Then you have certain floors in the cad model that do not match the footprint but can be located based on internal structures like elevator shafts and stairwells. The objective is to geo locate cad data based on footprints, or aerial imagery. Auto georefrencing of images I believe is possible already thanks to ESRi deep learning, but more complex vector data, like cad and BIM data doesn’t work. It’s far more complex.",

They all reduce to six operations: SELECT, COMPRESS, FORMAT, ISOLATE, PERSIST, and WRITE.\nOnce you see it this way, “should we use RAG or fine-tuning?” becomes the wrong question. RAG is a SELECT strategy. Fine-tuning is PERSIST. Prompt engineering is FORMAT + ISOLATE. The real question is: what composition of context operations does my specific problem require?\nCurious if this maps to what others are seeing in production.",

So they are many opportunities, you just need to find a professor that has many ties with the industry. The only issue is that you could be working on something that a big company, like Honeywell, is also working on. Like your thesis is the use of CNN for visual inspection of steel ingots, another company is also working on the same thing, you will still get a diploma, but you could have some difficulties finding a job after that.

If you are like me, your first few ideas will work really well but will have already been done. Eventually you’ll create something truly novel. That will help you land an internship. If it doesn’t, keep whacking away, ensure your projects are killer quality. Once you’ve landed the internship your utility (from the amount/rareness of skills to hours logged to insights generated and tested) will determine your staying power. I want to negotiate from a stronger position and contribute massively to the field, so I’m focusing on home run style experiments and potentially a foundational startup",
