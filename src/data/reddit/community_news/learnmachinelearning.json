As a result, you're essentially computing\n\n    z_{iron} = v_{iron} + noise ||v_{type}||/sqrt(N)\n\nnormalizing v, you're basically computing the actual concept vector for `v_{iron}`, plus noise of O(n^(-1/2)). E.g. if you can provide 100 `iron X` samples, your noise goes down to ~10%.\n\nIf structurally, iron and diamond items have the exact same types (e.g. swords, bars, etc), then the noise term will be structurally similar (same general direction), so `- z_{iron} + z_{diamond}` should be able to cancel the noise out almost perfectly. However, adding/subtracting concepts together without cancellation will amplify the noise, and categories with low # of types to average will have proportionally sqrt(N) times more noise.\n\nIt might be worthwhile to do a few power-iterations on the 2nd-moment operator `M = 1/N \\sum_{type} v_{iron type} v_{iron type}^T` using the mean `z_{iron}` direction to get to the real `v_{iron}` direction (probably converges in just 1-2 steps since the mean `z_{iron}` is already dominated in the `v_{iron}` direction). It's fairly cheap and would allow you to avoid the sqrt(N) noise term.",

If we only had a random sample of half of the iron items and half of the diamond items would it still work well? Cause then we could use it to generate diamond versions of iron pieces we don’t have and vice versa.\n\nIt’s possible I just don’t grasp the use case of VAEs in general and that’s where my confusion comes from.",

If I ask it to generate new items, the quality is meh and I wouldn't be surprised if we did that experiment and asked it to generate something that did not exist in its training data, the VAE would struggle to generate something out of distribution like that. I am definetly making the task easier by trying to generate something that I know was present in the training data.\n\nTake the second example (the one where we turn a gold horse armor to a golden shovel). The fact that the generated shovel is yellow, shows that somewhere in the latent space, color of the object is one of the compressed features it learned to be useful for reconstructing.\n\nUltimately, the essence of the latents is that they are just 32 numbers trying to compress the information of a 3\\*16\\*16 = 768 pixel image. So the VAE has to find the most useful high-level features that characterize each image.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been reviewing the basics for upcoming interviews, and I realized I often get stuck trying to explain simple concepts without using jargon.\n\nI wrote down a summary for the top 10 algorithms to help me memorize them. I figured this might help others here who are just starting out or refreshing their memory.\n\nHere is the list:\n\n# 1. Linear Regression\n\n* **The Gist:** Drawing the straightest possible line through a scatter plot of data points to predict a value (like predicting house prices based on size).\n* **Key Concept:** Minimizing the \"error\" (distance) between the line and the actual data points.\n\n# 2. Logistic Regression\n\n* **The Gist:** Despite the name, it's for **classification**, not regression. It fits an \"S\" shaped curve (Sigmoid) to the data to separate it into two groups (e.g., \"Spam\" vs. \"Not Spam\").\n* **Key Concept:** It outputs a probability between 0 and 1.\n\n# 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n\n* **The Gist:** The \"peer pressure\" algorithm. If you want to know what a new data point is, you look at its 'K' nearest neighbors. If most of them are Blue, the new point is probably Blue.\n* **Key Concept:** It doesn't actually \"learn\" a model; it just memorizes the data (Lazy Learner).\n\n# 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n\n* **The Gist:** Imagine two groups of data on the floor. SVM tries to put a wide street (hyperplane) between them. The goal is to make the street as wide as possible without touching any data points.\n* **Key Concept:** The \"Kernel Trick\" allows it to separate data that isn't easily separable by a straight line by projecting it into higher dimensions.\n\n# 5. Decision Trees\n\n* **The Gist:** A flowchart of questions. \"Is it raining?\" -> Yes -> \"Is it windy?\" -> No -> \"Play Tennis.\" It splits data into smaller and smaller chunks based on simple rules.\n* **Key Concept:** Easy to interpret, but prone to \"overfitting\" (memorizing the data too perfectly).\n\n# 6. Random Forest\n\n* **The Gist:** A democracy of Decision Trees. You build 100 different trees and let them vote on the answer. The majority wins.\n* **Key Concept:** Reduces the risk of errors that a single tree might make (Ensemble Learning).\n\n# 7. K-Means Clustering\n\n* **The Gist:** You have a messy pile of unlabelled data. You want to organize it into 'K' number of piles. The algorithm randomly picks centers for the piles and keeps moving them until the groups make sense.\n* **Key Concept:** Unsupervised learning (we don't know the answers beforehand).\n\n# 8. Naive Bayes\n\n* **The Gist:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. It assumes that all features are independent (which is \"naive\" because in real life, things are usually related).\n* **Key Concept:** Surprisingly good for text classification (like filtering emails).\n\n# 9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n\n* **The Gist:** Data compression. You have a dataset with 50 columns (features), but you only want the 2 or 3 that matter most. PCA combines variables to reduce complexity while keeping the important information.\n* **Key Concept:** Dimensionality Reduction.\n\n# 10. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)\n\n* **The Gist:** Similar to Random Forest, but instead of building trees at the same time, it builds them one by one. Each new tree tries to fix the mistakes of the previous tree.\n* **Key Concept:** Often the winner of Kaggle competitions for tabular data.\n\nIf you want to connect these concepts to real production workflows, one helpful resource is a hands-on course on Machine Learning on Google Cloud. It shows how algorithms like Linear/Logistic Regression, PCA, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting: [Machine Learning on Google Cloud](https://www.netcomlearning.com/course/machine-learning-on-google-cloud)\n\nLet me know if I missed any major ones or if you have a better analogy for them!",

It fits an \"S\" shaped curve (Sigmoid) to the data to separate it into two groups (e.g., \"Spam\" vs. \"Not Spam\").\n\nThis isn't correct: regression is descriptive of the model being fit, classification is one use case for it. It isn't fitting an s-shaped curve directly, the fit is actually linear with respect to the log-odds, not the probability itself. The s-curve arises when you convert the output of the model back to probabilities.\n\nUnderstanding that the output people normally work with \"lives\" in a different space than the model is important if you're interpreting coefficients, or if you want to use a linear model with other types of responses. You can use Poisson/Negative Binomial regression for count data, beta regression for continuous proportions, gamma regression for data that is positive continuous and skewed, etc. All of these (and logistic regression) are types of Generalized Linear Models that differ by the function used to go from the original scale of the data to the scale the model is being fit on. Interestingly enough, this is an avenue for modeling probabilities in alternative ways - you get different shaped s-curves if you use probit, Chauchit, Cloglog functions instead of logit, for example. Not super common but worth knowing about.\n\n>**The Gist:** Data compression. You have a dataset with 50 columns (features), but you only want the 2 or 3 that matter most. PCA combines variables to reduce complexity while keeping the important information.\n\nAlso worth noting that this is just one thing PCA is particularly useful for. What you're doing is making new variables that \"explain\" the variance of the data independently of one another (they're uncorrelated/orthogonal). The first one captures the most variability, the second one captures the most variance in the absence of the first, and so on and so forth. You end up with 50 new columns containing the same information as the original data, but past a certain point they're just capturing the leftovers.\n\nPCA doesn't necessarily reduce complexity (in terms of information) directly, it allows you to cut out as much of it as you can without sacrificing fidelity - past the first few components, the only thing being captured is smaller and smaller chunks of noise. Sort of like discarding pixels in a region of an image that appears purely black to the naked eye and probably only differs due to camera sensor noise - you could use interpolation to reconstruct most of them and nobody would be the wiser. Note: a fun idea to play with here is to actually use PCA for compression. You can start with a dataset that has a column for each color channel and a row for each pixel, and then see what happens if you start pooling information for nearby pixels. \n\nComplexity is also reduced in a practical sensed because correlated variables end up getting decomposed into variables that contain shared and unique information. If they're highly correlated, that unique information isn't contributing much and may end up getting discarded - you're effectively collapsing dimensions.",

Also: being able to explain tradeoffs to non-ML folks.\n\nTheory vs applied: learn enough theory to not cargo-cult, then spend most time shipping small end-to-end projects on real datasets. Add one “production muscle” each time (e.g., simple API, logging, monitoring metric).\n\nIf you’re starting again: foundations first (stats + Python + data), then projects, then specialize once you’ve built a few things you can show.",

Some can be simplified more easily and with less risk than others. If you are working with delicate personally identifiable information, strictness on processes and requirements go up and the consequences of failure to adhere to those standards along with it, meaning the budget to adhere to certain standards is more easily acquired.",

CNNs made sense once I understood basic image processing ideas. Autoencoders clicked as compression + reconstruction. Even time series models felt intuitive once I framed them as structured sequences with locality and dependency over time.\n\nBut RNNs? They’ve been uniquely hard in a way nothing else has been.\n\nIt’s not that the math is incomprehensible, or that I don’t understand sequences. I *do*. I understand sliding windows, autoregressive models, sequence-to-sequence setups, and I’ve even built LSTM-based projects before without fully “getting” what was going on internally.\n\nWhat trips me up is that RNNs don’t give me a stable mental model. The hidden state feels fundamentally opaque i.e. it's not like a feature map or a signal transformation, but a compressed, evolving internal memory whose semantics I can’t easily reason about. Every explanation feels syntactically different, but conceptually slippery in the same way.",

I think a natural progression to build up your intuition regarding latent-state models is to start with Discrete-time Hidden Markov Models, which are very easy to intuit.\n\nThe problem is that HMMs are inefficient in high dimensions. Factorial HMMs improve this by distributing the state into multiple binary variables, but this makes inference much more expensive to calculate. Intuitively, the fix is to move to Linear Dynamical Systems, where the state vectors are now continuous rather than discrete (think Kalman Filters, if you're familiar). This solves the representation problem, but now you have a linearity issue because you can only model simple curves. How do we fix that? We take the Linear Dynamical System and wrap the transition in a non-linear activation function. That is effectively an RNN.\n\nThere's a lot of nuance missing here and I've been a bit handwavey (it's not intended to fix your intuition) but I think there's value in studying what came before RNN's and building your intuition up from there, particularly in relation to what actually is actually going on in latent space, and what that represents. I'm unsure how helpful this is if you're not particularly interested in the theory, and just want some intuition. But I think the intuition comes from the theory, and seeing how it progresses.",

With deep neural networks, overfitting is not a feature. It is a bug.\n\nMedium Link for better readability: [https://vizuara.medium.com/an-introduction-to-physics-informed-neural-networks-pinns-teach-your-neural-network-to-respect-af484ac650fc](https://vizuara.medium.com/an-introduction-to-physics-informed-neural-networks-pinns-teach-your-neural-network-to-respect-af484ac650fc)\n\nLet us consider a hypothetical set of experiments. You throw a ball up (or at an angle), and note down the height of the ball at different points of time.\n\nWhen you plot the height v/s time, you will see something like this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b9byjx62pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=22aebc098ad30d2b18505fcaa3d80cf61777f2b5\n\nIt is easy to train a neural network on this dataset so that you can predict the height of the ball even at time points where you did not note down the height in your experiments.\n\nFirst, let us discuss how this training is done.\n\n# Training a regular neural network\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/732wrp23pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c65e4fc46e3a8fd8fcac281361ece4328932f2b\n\nYou can construct a neural network with few or multiple hidden layers. The input is time (t) and the output predicted by the neural network is height of the ball (h).\n\nThe neural network will be initialized with random weights. This means the predictions of h(t) made by the neural network will be very bad initially as shown in the image below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdgeu9s4pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e97b932fe7bef937f45716295435c7d50c0212f\n\nWe need to penalize the neural network for making these bad predictions right? How do we do that? In the form of loss functions.\n\nLoss of a neural network is a measure of how bad its predictions are compared the real data. The close the predictions and data, the lower the loss.\n\nA singular goal of neural network training is to minimize the loss.\n\nSo how can we define the loss here? Consider the 3 options below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/slcx6y27pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcccb9ec6c9aac8b976b71ae5a7f7f6dfd481c24\n\nIn all the 3 options, you are finding the average of some kind of loss.\n\n* **Option 1 is not good** because positive and negative errors will cancel each other.\n* **Option 2 is okay** because we are taking the absolute value of errors, but the problem is modulus function is not differentiable at x=0.\n* **Option 3 is the best**. It is a square function which means individual errors are converted to positive numbers and the function is differentiable. This is the famous Mean Squared Error (MSE). You are taking the mean value of the square of all individual errors.\n\nHere error means the difference between actual value and predicted value.\n\nMean Squared Error is minimum when the predictions are very close to the experimental data as shown in the figure below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwm6mxq8pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=33983e165ecec1efca3a973e97b3d28aa2a89782\n\nBut there is a problem with this approach. What if your experimental data was not good? In the image below you can see that one of the data points is not following the trend shown by the rest of the dataset.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mswknvl9pwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=71546cc05f741175a11e486ae3fe6a77c44b82e7\n\nThere can be multiple reasons due to which such data points show up in the data.\n\n1. You did not perform the experiments well. You made a manual mistake while noting the height.\n2. The sensor or instrument using which you were making the height measurement was faulty.\n3. A sudden gush of wind caused a sudden jump in the height of the ball.\n\nThere could be many possibilities that results in outliers and noise in a dataset.\n\nKnowing that real life data may have noise and outliers, it will not be wise if we train a neural network to exactly mimic this dataset. It results in something called as overfitting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1e7r509apwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3269c58b8ca9e873945ca9970aafac78bc53279\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l0fgrzrapwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=28acb46d2af8e6398876ee107b7900e860061904\n\nIn the figure above, mean squared error will be low in both cases. However in one case neural network is fitting on outlier also, which is not good. So what should we do?\n\n# Bring physics into the picture\n\nIf you are throwing a ball and observing its physics, then you already have some knowledge about the trajectory of the ball, based on Newton’s laws of motion.\n\nSure, you may be making simplifications by assuming that the effect of wind or air drag or buoyancy are negligible. But that does not take away from the fact that you already have decent knowledge about this system even in the absence of a trained neural network.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8cudgx0epwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=9efaf22e50525030c0ceaa9995b0afe96a26c79d\n\nThe physics you assume may not be in perfect agreement with the experimental data as shown above, but it makes sense to think that the experiments will not deviate too much from physics.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fpy7q3oepwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5ff5cacaf8b8d2895139589897c6dd3d670be9\n\nSo if one of your experimental data points deviate too much from what physics says, there is probably something wrong with that data point. So how can you let you neural network take care of this?\n\n# How can you teach physics to neural networks?\n\nIf you want to teach physics to neural network, then you have to somehow incentivize neural network to make predictions closer to what is suggested by physics.\n\nIf the neural network makes a prediction where the height of the ball is far away from the purple dotted line, then loss should increase.\n\nIf the predictions are closer to the dotted line, then the loss should be minimum.\n\nWhat does this mean? Modify the loss function.\n\nHow can you modify the loss function such that the loss is high when predictions deviate from physics? And how does this enable the neural network make more physically sensible predictions? **Enter PINN Physics Informed Neural Network.**  \n  \nPhysics Informed Neural Network (PINN)\n\nThe goal of PINNs is to solve (*or learn solutions to*) differential equations by embedding the known physics (or governing differential equations) directly into the neural network’s training objective (loss function).\n\nThe idea of PINNs were introduced in this seminal paper by Maziar Raissi et. al.: [https://maziarraissi.github.io/PINNs/](https://maziarraissi.github.io/PINNs/)\n\nThe basic idea in PINN is to have a neural network is trained to minimize a loss function that includes:\n\n1. A **data mismatch** term (*if observational data are available*).\n2. A **physics loss** term enforcing the differential equation itself (and initial/boundary conditions).\n\n# Let us implement PINN on our example\n\nLet us look at what we know about our example. When a ball is thrown up, it trajectory h(t) varies according to the following ordinary differential equation (ODE).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vacsz6dlpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=14111c810dba1e861fbcc71a1bf8d920e479448c\n\nHowever this ODE alone cannot fully describe h(t) uniquely. You also need an initial condition. Mathematically this is because to solve a first-order differential equation in time, you need 1 initial condition.\n\nLogically, to know height as a function of time, you need to know the starting height from which the ball was thrown. Look at the image below. In both cases, the balls are thrown at the exact same time with the exact same initial velocity component in the vertical direction. But the h(t) depends on the initial height. So you need to know h(t=0) for fully describing the height of the ball as a function of time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eobv9u1mpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=a28a6c8584f37683f703b4c72a5a8f436353dedc\n\nThis means it is not enough to make the neural network make accurate predictions on dh/dt, the neural network should also make accurate prediction on h(t=0) for fully matching the physics in this case.\n\n# Loss due to dh/dt (ODE loss)\n\nWe know the expected dh/dt because we know the initial velocity and acceleration due to gravity.\n\nHow do we get the dh/dt predicted by the neural network? After all it is predicting height h, not velocity v or dh/dt. The answer is **Automatic differentiation (AD).**\n\nBecause most machine‐learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX) support automatic differentiation, you can compute dh/dt by differentiating the neural network.\n\nThus, we have a predicted dh/dt (from the neural network differentiation) for every experimental time points, and we have an actual dh/dt based on the physics.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/msf6gyunpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=1392d9e60f5ee011a480392af07e05bc5d094492\n\nNow we can define a loss due to the difference between predicted and physics-based dh/dt.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/68xl4xpopwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b9a727be489bd8736e8ffc235f49fca5dc25b9a\n\nMinimizing this loss (which I prefer to call ODE loss) is a good thing to ensure that neural network learns the ODE. But that is not enough. We need to make the neural network follow the initial condition also. That brings us to the next loss term.Initial condition loss\n\n# Initial condition loss\n\nThis is easy. You know the initial condition. You make the neural network make a prediction of height for t=0. See how far off the prediction is from the reality. You can construct a squared error which can be called as the *Initial Condition Loss.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4u4syj1qpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=591b7e0f46ebf32024533c9d727042a889c3007d\n\nSo is that it? You have ODE loss and Initial condition loss. Is it enough that the neural network tries to minimize these 2 losses? What about the experimental data? There are 3 things to consider.\n\n1. You cannot throw away the experimental data.\n2. You cannot neglect the physics described by the ODEs or PDEs.\n3. You cannot neglect the initial and/or boundary conditions.\n\nThus you have to also consider the data-based mean squared error loss along with ODE loss and Initial condition loss.\n\n# The modified loss term\n\nThe simple mean squared error based loss term can now be modified like below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2xc18prpwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=95fabc8b54b2b291292d6ab2c15f5810c13379ce\n\nIf there are boundary conditions in addition to initial conditions, you can add an additional term based on the difference between predicted boundary conditions and actual boundary conditions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezh3in7spwdg1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=70367e6fbb1aa6e7924d93da8ff3b0ce8898419d\n\nHere the Data loss term ensures that the predictions are not too far from the experimental data points.\n\nThe *ODE loss term* \\+ the *initial condition loss term* ensures that the predictions are not too far from what described by the physics.\n\nIf you are pretty sure about the physics the you can set λ1 to zero. In the ball throwing experiment, you will be sure about the physics described by our ODE if air drag, wind, buoyancy and any other factors are ignored. Only gravity is present. And in such cases, the PINN effectively becomes an ODE solver.\n\nHowever, for real life cases where only part of the physics is known or if you are not fully sure of the ODE, then you retain λ1 and other λ terms in the net loss term. That way you force the neural network to respect physics as well as the experimental data. This also suppress the effects of experimental noise and outliers.\n\n>",

Focus on data first, then evaluation that matches what a user actually cares about, even if it is a rough metric. Deployment and feedback loops can be ugly and manual at the start, and that is fine. You get comfortable by shipping small, imperfect things and seeing where they break.",

Most real ML work is not about the algorithm at all, but about turning a vague goal into a concrete, testable question and accepting imperfect data. One way to reduce the overwhelm is to start by stripping the problem down to the smallest version that would still be useful, even if it feels almost trivial. Build something that works end to end, even if it is naive, and then iterate. Over time, you realize the messiness is the work, not a sign that you are doing it wrong.",

      "text": "I've spent the last few weeks building a GPT-style LLM entirely from scratch in PyTorch to understand the architecture. This isn't just a wrapper; it's a full implementation covering the entire lifecycle from tokenization to instruction fine-tuning.\n\nI have followed Sebastian Raschka's 'Build a LLM from Scratch' book for the implementation, here is the breakdown of the repo:\n\n**1. Data & Tokenization (**`src/data.py`**)** Instead of using pre-built tokenizers, I implemented:\n\n* `SimpleTokenizerV2`: Handles regex-based splitting and special tokens (`<|endoftext|>`, `<|unk|>`).\n* `GPTDatasetV1`: A sliding-window dataset implementation for efficient autoregressive training.\n\n**2. The Attention Mechanism (**`src/attention.py`**)**\n\nI manually implemented `MultiHeadAttention` to understand the tensor math:\n\n* Handles the query/key/value projections and splitting heads.\n* Implements the **Causal Mask** (using `register_buffer`) to prevent the model from \"cheating\" by seeing future tokens.\n* Includes `SpatialDropout` and scaled dot-product attention.\n\n**3. The GPT Architecture (**`src/model.py`**)** A complete 124M parameter model assembly:\n\n* Combines `TransformerBlock`, `LayerNorm`, and `GELU` activations.\n* Features positional embeddings and residual connections exactly matching the GPT-2 spec.\n\n**4. Training & Generation (**`src/train.py`**)**\n\n* Custom training loop with loss visualization.\n* Implements `generate()` with **Top-K sampling** and **Temperature scaling** to control output creativity.\n\n**5. Fine-tuning:**\n\n* **Classification (**`src/finetune_classification.py`**):** Adapted the backbone to detect Spam/Ham messages (90%+ accuracy on the test set).\n* **Instruction Tuning (**`src/finetune_instructions.py`**):** Implemented an Alpaca-style training loop. The model can now handle instruction-response pairs rather than just completing text.\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/Nikshaan/llm-from-scratch](https://github.com/Nikshaan/llm-from-scratch)\n\nI’ve tried to comment every shape transformation in the code.

      "text": "I graduated from university a couple of months ago. Since 2024, I've been working at a startup as a software development intern, and almost a year ago I was promoted to Junior ML/AI.\n\nI have two questions. First, why haven't I been working for months? I'm still getting paid because it's a small startup, and the person in charge of me is always busy, so no matter how many projects I ask or how much they promise me, I haven't received any since august. Supposedly, we're supposed to have our first in-person meeting on Monday after almost two years working there.\n\nIn the few projects I've worked on, my boss saw potential in me for AI/ML, but since I started university, I've always planned to work in web development, so my actual knowledge of AI/ML is limited, and it wasn't even something I had considered working in.\n\nI recently got access to a Udemy account and even bought some O'Reilly books on Humble Bundle. Is that enough? Is there a practical roadmap?I don't expect to learn it all in just a few months or week, but I do want to start exploring this field. I want to know what to expect and what skills are most in demand for junior professionals these days.\n\nI also hope to be able to change jobs eventually because, although this is a comfortable job, I want to advance and learn in my career. Unfortunately, in my contry there aren't many opportunities for entry-level positions, only for more advanced engineers (I'm not from the USA).\n\nI really want to learn because I HATE doing things poorly or half-heartedly, and I also don't want to pass up the opportunity to learn in this area even though it wasn't what I was looking for.",

In practice, most ML engineers spend far more time waiting on data, clarifying vague goals, or being blocked by infra and priorities than training models. That is often why you are idle, not because you are doing something wrong. Courses and books are useful, but they only stick once you are trying to solve a concrete problem end to end, even a small one, with messy data and unclear success criteria. The skills that actually matter early on are solid software fundamentals, data handling, and understanding why a model breaks in production, not knowing every algorithm. If your current role is not giving you projects, I would treat it as paid time to build small applied projects and learn the tooling, while being realistic that many “junior ML” titles are closer to generic dev roles with an AI label.",

Be warned regression is very limited when compared to the type of operations neural nets can do since, in regression you have to specify all the relationships between variables. But I think it can be a good jumping off point if you want to see what it means for a computer to come up with its own weights that relate the training data to the variable of interest.",

The structure I’ve been told is 1h discussion of my hackerrank submission (I had to essentially create an ML pipeline to identify fraudulent data) and then 1h “ML generalist” interview.\n\nI’m really not sure what to expect. Also I’m a little nervous as I don’t come from a formal ML background (although this was the focus of an internship and my final year masters project so I’m familiar with what I’ve worked with) but my worry is I may have missed some fundamental concepts due to the fact I learnt as I went when doing my projects (both very deep learning focussed). Currently working through Andrew Ngs courses on coursera and it doesn’t seem too alien so I guess that’s a good sign!?\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated.",

Remember that they're probably more interested in your thought process than the perfect solution.\n\nFor the \"ML generalist\" part, brush up on the basics like different ML algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, etc.), bias-variance tradeoff, regularization techniques, and evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, etc.). Honestly, knowing the fundamentals is key even if you've mostly worked with deep learning. Make sure to also brush up on real-world applications of ML and how you would approach a specific business problem using it. There's a ton of [ML interview questions](https://www.interviewquery.com/playlists/ml-engineering-50) resources online if you want to get used to how companies specifically evaluate you, like the one I've linked which covers everything from algorithms to evaluation.

Even just saying “I used PR-AUC / focused on recall because…” is a good signal.\n\nFor the “ML generalist” hour: it’s usually fundamentals + debugging mindset. Things like:\n\n* bias vs variance / overfitting\n* train/val/test splits + leakage\n* evaluation metrics (esp. precision/recall/F1, ROC vs PR)\n* how you’d diagnose a model that’s doing badly (data quality? label noise? leakage? feature issues?)\n\nAlso, since you said your experience is more deep-learning focused: try to make sure you can comfortably explain the basics of “boring” models too (logistic regression, trees/GBMs, regularization). In a lot of real interview loops, they love candidates who don’t jump straight to neural nets for tabular problems.\n\nIf Andrew Ng feels familiar, that’s honestly a good sign. The big win is being able to explain your choices clearly and talk about trade-offs without panicking.",
