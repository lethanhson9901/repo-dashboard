And I can hardly recall using the same strategy for more than 2 clients. Each one has their own flair, their own style or a “human touch” as i like to say that makes their marketing unique. Sure there are now tools like Blobr AI, LocalQ or Ryze AI that can automate reports but to say that they can replace our work is downplaying our role, undermining our experiences. How does AI train itself? By regurgitating information that humans have already done in the past. Hypothetically, if humans were to be replaced, there would come a point where AI wouldn’t be able to offer any sort of new or beneficial suggestions. And who would come to its aid then? So, the next time anyone says that marketing is going to be majorly automated, do enlighten them :)",

However, AI IS going to lead to a reduction in the digital marketing and programming workforce - industry wide.  But I think it will impact major corporations more than small shops and I actually see AI a major advantage for small agencies like mine.  \n\nWith its current capabilities, AI does more to increase the capacity and output of a competent marketer or programmer.  This likely results in fewer people needed industry wide. \n\nI think it will also lead to new opportunities and perhaps spinoff industries.  \n\nThe role of my employees and their daily activities will probably change significantly over the next few years.  I am optimistic that it will be an improvement for everyone.  We will do better, more thorough work with the help of AI.  We can spend more time on marketing strategy, a little less time on implementation and a lot less time on observation and reporting.\n\nBut there are definitely new threats to my business.

The marketers I see struggling are the ones who were basically doing what AI does - cranking out generic blog posts, writing cookie-cutter ad copy, building templated strategies. Yeah, AI can do that now.\n\n\n\nBut the ones who actually understand their client's business, who can read between the lines of data and say \"here's why this campaign flopped even though the numbers look fine on paper\" - AI isn't touching that.\n\n\n\nWhat I've noticed is that AI is actually making good marketers even better. I use it to handle the grunt work (first drafts, data organization, brainstorming) which frees me up to spend more time on strategy and client relationships. That's where the real value is.\n\n\n\nThe human touch thing you mentioned is spot on. Every client has a different voice, different audience, different goals. AI can approximate that but it can't truly understand the nuances. I had a client in a very niche B2B space and every AI-generated piece sounded like it was written for a generic SaaS company. The industry-specific knowledge and tone just wasn't there.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, AI is a tool upgrade not a replacement. The people worried about it are probably the ones who need to level up their actual skills.",

They teach you how traffic actually works, what keywords bring visitors, and what pages perform. Most beginners skip this and operate blindly.\n\nSecond, a basic keyword research tool like Ubersuggest, Ahrefs (if budget allows), or even Google Keyword Planner. Understanding search intent and keyword demand is foundational for SEO and content marketing.\n\nThird, a simple content and design tool like Canva. You don't need Photoshop in the beginning - Canva is more than enough for social posts, thumbnails, and basic creatives.\n\nFourth, an email marketing tool (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.). Even if your list is small, learning how to build and nurture an audience early is powerful.\n\nAnd finally, a social scheduling tool (like Buffer or Meta Business Suite) to stay consistent without burning out.\n\nBeginners often think advanced tools equal better marketing. In reality, mastering a small stack deeply is far more valuable than juggling everything. What helped me most early on was understanding analytics and search intent - everything else builds on that.",

I'd suggest this order for you specifically:\n\nStart with Google Analytics and Search Console, so you understand how traffic and performance work. Then learn basic SEO and keyword research, because that's what connects content to visibility. After that, explore paid ads (Meta and Google Ads) since your creative background will help you massively there. Good creatives often outperform average ones even with the same targeting.\n\nAs for courses, you don't need anything overly expensive at the beginning. Solid options:\n\n* Google's free Digital Marketing & E-commerce Certificate\n* HubSpot's free marketing certifications\n* Meta Blueprint (for paid social)\n\nThose give you structured fundamentals without heavy investment. But here's something important: alongside courses, try applying it immediately. Maybe offer to handle SEO or social strategy for one of your current clients at a small fee or as a test case. Practical experience will teach you faster than theory alone.",

Start with Google Analytics. Seriously, sit with this for 2-3 months before adding anything. Most beginners don't understand what UTM parameters are or why conversion tracking matters. If you don't know this, nothing else makes sense.\n\n\n\n2. Pick ONE channel and go deep. Don't try SEO + Ads + Social simultaneously. You'll be mediocre at everything. I'd pick SEO because it compounds and actually teaches you how marketing works (keyword intent, conversion paths, content strategy).\n\n\n\n3. After 3 months with #1 and #2, then add a design tool (Canva) and an email tool. Not before.\n\n\n\nThe problem with the \"full stack\" approach is beginners get distracted. They spend 2 hours in Figma, 2 hours in Mailchimp, 2 hours trying to set up a CRM, and never actually execute the one thing that would move the needle.\n\n\n\nTools don't matter.

          "text": "Great question. We faced the exact same inquiries from our local clients about 6 months ago. Telling them \"it's a black box\" is leaving money on the table. While AI algorithms are opaque, the inputs they rely on are actually very clear.\n\nHere is how we explain (and sell) \"Local GEO\" vs. \"Local SEO\":\n\n1. The Shift from \"Proximity\" to \"Sentiment\"\n\nLocal SEO (Google Maps): Cares about where the user is standing (Proximity).\n\nLocal GEO (ChatGPT/Perplexity): Cares about what people are saying.\n\nActionable Step: We optimize reviews not just for stars, but for keywords. If a client wants to rank for \"Best Emergency Dentist,\" we encourage reviews that specifically mention \"saved me in an emergency.\" LLMs read this semantic context and serve it as an answer.\n\n2. Data Consensus (The Trust Signal)\n\nLLMs hallucinate, so they crave verification. If your client's NAP (Name, Address, Phone) varies across Yelp, Apple Maps, and Bing, the AI lowers its \"Confidence Score\" and won't recommend them.\n\nOur pitch: \"We sanitize your data so the AI trusts you enough to recommend you.\"\n\n3. The \"Best Of\" Ecosystem\n\nWhen you ask ChatGPT for a recommendation, it often synthesizes answers from top-ranking blog posts like \"Top 10 Dentists in Austin.\"\n\nStrategy: Getting your client mentioned in these local \"listicles\" is essentially the new backlink strategy for AI.\n\nSo no, don't tell them it's unknown. Tell them you are optimizing their \"Digital Trust Footprint\" so AI models feel safe recommending them.\n\nHope this helps frame it for your agency!",

      "text": "For years, the rule was simple: rank higher, get more traffic, win. But AI Overviews are changing what winning looks like. Users can get a product recommendation, a short comparison, even pros and cons without clicking anything.\n\n*So, if your brand is present inside AI answers, is traffic still the main KPI, or is it becoming a vanity metric?*\n\nWe ran a study to understand how much influence review platforms still have in AI Overviews, especially for commercial queries where people are choosing software or services. The results look like a paradox:\n\nReview platforms show up in roughly every third AI Overview. Specifically, 34.5% of AI Overviews cited at least one review platform. \n\nThat means most AI answers still come from somewhere else. And yet, when review platforms do appear, Google often includes more than one in the same answer. In AI Overviews that include review sites, we saw an average of 2.28 review-platform links per response. It’s like the system prefers to present a comparison view instead of one single source.\n\n*Even more interesting:* the words people use in the query change everything. If the query clearly asks for reviews or ratings, review platforms appear far more often. If the query is more like best or top, review platforms show up much less. \n\nThat’s counterintuitive for anyone who assumed best tools queries would naturally lean on G2/Capterra-style sources.\n\nEven the platforms that dominate AI citations still lost most of their organic traffic between early 2024 and the end of 2025. The declines in our dataset ranged from 76.5% to 92.2%. In plain terms, being heavily cited by AI did not protect them from losing clicks:\n\n* Review platforms appear in 34.5% of AI Overviews\n* Query wording impact: review/rating queries 49%, software/tools queries 39.4%, best/top queries 17.1%\n* The top five platforms account for 88% of all review-platform links in AI Overviews (Gartner Peer Insights, G2, Capterra, Software Advice, TrustRadius)\n* Organic traffic declines for the most cited platforms ranged from 76.5% to 92.2% from early 2024 to end of 2025\n* When review platforms appear, AI Overviews often include multiple: 2.28 review links per response on average\n\nSo what are we supposed to optimize for now?\n\nIf AI can borrow your credibility and your structure to answer the query directly, traffic may drop even while influence stays high. That shifts the game from visits to visibility inside the answer layer.\n\nWe’d love your take: Is traffic still the goal, or is the new goal to be included and trusted inside AI answers, even if the click never happens? And if you agree, what metrics are you using to prove value to stakeholders?",

Some teams still use tools like Waalaxy or Expandi, but they get messy fast if you’re juggling multiple client accounts or trying to keep tone consistent. That’s where something like HeyReach feels a bit more practical since it’s built around running several LinkedIn accounts without turning everything into obvious spam. Still only works if the message actually makes sense for who you’re reaching.  \n  \nTwitter and Reddit feel more like research and reputation layers than outreach layers. You pick up language, pain points, timing. Then LinkedIn or email becomes the place where you actually start the conversation. When people jump straight to DMs on Reddit or X, it almost always backfires.  \n  \nThe big filter for me is always intent. If someone is clearly in discovery mode, LinkedIn or email is fine.

Not blasting connection requests, but targeted outreach where the message is obviously relevant to their role or current situation. Quiet readers are still there, they just don’t engage publicly.\n\nTwitter is tougher unless you already have history, but it can work if you treat it less like outreach and more like reputation building. People notice patterns over time, not single DMs. Cold Twitter DMs without context usually go nowhere.\n\nReddit is different. It’s not an outreach channel in the traditional sense. It’s more like a long game of being useful in the right rooms. When you consistently add value to conversations your ICP already cares about, DMs tend to come to you. The moment it feels transactional, it backfires.\n\nThe mistake I see most is trying to force the same behavior everywhere. Each platform has its own social contract. If you respect that, outreach feels like relevance instead of noise.\n\nThere’s a bit more nuance in how to decide where to invest first depending on your ICP and offer, but that’s the general framework I use.

A video gets edited twice because the “final” version wasn’t actually final.\n\nIt’s rarely about needing some giant enterprise suite. It’s usually about too many half-solutions stacked together.\n\nThe teams that seem to calm things down pick one scheduler that actually publishes consistently and move approvals inside that tool instead of running them through chat. That alone cuts a surprising amount of friction. Same with a shared inbox that forces ownership so comments don’t just sit there waiting for whoever notices first.\n\nAlso, separating drafting from publishing, even if it’s informal, helps more than people expect. When one person is creating and another is responsible for pushing live + monitoring, things stop slipping through cracks.\n\nHalf the battle is really just removing duplication.",

          "text": "Not a dumb question at all, most ecom brands completely ignore post purchase and leave stupid amounts of money on the table. It's one of the highest leverage things you can do because the hardest and most expensive part, getting someone to trust you enough to buy, is already done.\n\nThe math is pretty simple. Acquiring a new customer costs whatever your CAC is. Getting an existing buyer to purchase again costs almost nothing by comparison. Even small improvements in post purchase conversion rates have an outsized impact on overall profitability because there's virtually no additional acquisition cost eating into the margin.\n\nWhat actually works in practice from what we've seen with our clients. Post purchase upsell offers immediately after checkout convert anywhere from 5 to 15% depending on the offer relevance and discount. That's essentially free revenue on transactions that already happened. Retention email flows triggered by purchase behavior, not just generic \"thanks for buying\" sequences but actually intelligent flows based on what they bought, when they're likely to need a refill or complementary product, and their browsing behavior after purchase. Those consistently outperform broadcast campaigns by a wide margin.\n\nThe tools in this space have gotten way better. Cleverific is fine for Shopify focused post purchase offers but honestly the real gains come from building out the full retention system, not just slapping an upsell widget on the thank you page. The widget alone is a nice bump but it's like 20% of the actual opportunity.\n\nWhere most people screw this up is treating PRO as a one time setup and forgetting about it. The brands crushing it are testing different post purchase offers constantly, segmenting by first time vs repeat buyers, adjusting timing on follow up flows based on actual repurchase data, and tracking contribution margin on repeat purchases separately from new customer acquisition.\n\nThe biggest thing nobody talks about is that strong post purchase optimization actually makes your paid acquisition more aggressive because your LTV goes up. If you know a customer is worth $150 over 6 months instead of just their first $50 order, you can afford a higher CAC and outbid competitors who are only optimizing for first purchase ROAS. That's the real compounding effect.",

In our experience, we believe that it is supplementing, evolving and complimenting digital marketing rather than diminishing it.\n\n\n\nFrom a planning perspective, human value now shifts towards the strategic value generation where human expertise is expected to apply the guard rails and guidance to the learning that AI platforms are expected to make. This means that we get to move away from execution heavy tasks to more deliberate strategic thinking.\n\n  \nFrom a tools standpoint, AI has long since been used to power up marketing used to optimize based on past behavior (retargeting, lookalikes, demographics) towards intent prediction. And as a practice, this is only expected to grow with more and more optimisations leaning on predictive capabilities and therefore happening in real time with less data required than historically possible.\n\n  \nLastly, from a day to day perspective, we know the efficiency impact of AI on workflows, as tools get more robust, this can only improve further.\n\n  \n",

The plan-research-write-post-measure loop you described is really all most small teams need.\n\nWhat I ended up doing: research and writing goes through one AI subscription (Claude, ChatGPT, whatever you prefer). Scheduling goes through a simple scheduler or even native platform scheduling. Analytics lives in a basic dashboard or spreadsheet tracking what performed.\n\nTotal cost went from $100+ per month down to about $20-30, and the workflow is actually faster because there is less UI to navigate between steps.\n\nThe real insight is that the all-in-one tools are optimized for teams of 10+ where handoffs between people matter. For a solo operator or a small team, the overhead of learning and maintaining a complex platform outweighs the convenience of having everything in one place.

If you spend more time exporting/importing than thinking, it’s not simplifying anything.\n* Defining “done” for each stage this was the game changer. When a topic hits ready for draft, what inputs are really required? When something goes live, what one metric actually matters? Once you define those, half the features in most clouds become noise.\n\nFor us, that looked like:\n\n* lighter planning in something simple calendar + shared doc\n* research either manual or scoped to what matters for that topic\n* writing in the simplest editor that gets version history\n* posting via scheduler\n* a quick post-mortem list what worked, what didn’t\n\nIn one project we also tested visibility layers like SyndrAI not because it replaced tools, but because it made clear what wasn’t being tracked. That clarity alone cut down how much we felt like we needed the next thing.\n\n",

All I really wanted was a defined pipeline, but everything was super messy, everything felt like bloat.\n\nAfter trying way too many stacks, I stopped looking for the perfect tool and just built a small system around ChatGPT instead.\n\nIt sounds very complicated, but it wasn’t some huge coding project. I basically built a lightweight script that orchestrates prompts: it takes a topic + keywords, generates an outline, runs structured research prompts, writes a draft section by section, and exports a clean article. Most of it was copy/paste + tweaking code with ChatGPT/Copilot. Took around 3 days total.\n\nNow my workflow is pretty tight:\n\n• I generate a 3-month content strategy in one sitting with ChatGPT/Perplexity (12–16 articles)  \n• Quick manual keyword research per article (5–10 min)  \n• Feed the topic + keywords into my script, which runs a prompt pipeline (outline → research → draft) in the background  \n• 4–6 minutes later I have a structured draft  \n• I spend \\~15 minutes editing and polishing\n\nThe biggest win isn’t just speed (though it cut my production time by around 70%). It’s control. I’ve standardized client profiles, brand voice prompts, and article configs, so every piece of content is consistent and easy to tweak. The best part: I’m not locked into a $100+/month platform I barely use!\n\nAt this point I honestly think a simple custom workflow + AI beats most all-in-one marketing suites unless you need heavy team features...\n\nCurious if anyone else ended up building their own lightweight system instead of stacking tools. If anyone’s curious about mine, I’m happy to break down how I structured the prompt pipeline, it’s surprisingly simple once you see it laid out.",

The parent keyword looks huge but the audience behind it is fragmented.\n\n\"AI desktop companion\" is another interesting one from a search perspective. 0 monthly searches through all of 2022. Around 110/mo by mid-2024. Then 1,900 in November 2025, sitting at 720/mo now. Every month has beaten the same month the year before for 34 months straight. That kind of consistent year-over-year growth usually means the demand is real rather than a trend spike.\n\nAnthropic and OpenAI have both launched desktop companion features in the last few months. Replika is the biggest name in the companion space but they're dealing with regulatory problems. OpenClaw went viral last month as an open-source alternative. The space is moving fast but nobody really dominates any single niche yet.\n\nFrom a marketing perspective I think the opportunity is in the long-tail keywords rather than the parent term. The competition index on \"ai desktop companion\" is 73 but the CPC is only $0.87. Most of these niche companion terms have low CPCs relative to the growth they're showing. If you're doing content or SEO in the AI space these are worth watching.\n\nCheers - Alec",

If your first 3 seconds don't hook them, the algorithm kills the video.\nInstagram and TikTok are search engines now.

All of the prices I’ve gotten have seemed so astronomically high ranging from $800-$1500. And the $800 offer is from 2 18 year olds with little to no experience.\n\nI’m looking for someone who does their pricing on a per lead basis, every job that they bring in for me I pay them a percentage of that job. Is that unreasonable to look for? It adds a layer of security for me so I don’t get ripped off, and it uncaps their potential profit as long as their services work as well as they say they should.\n\nLet me know if I’m crazy to be looking for something this specific, I feel like I’m running out of local options.\n\n\\*EDIT\\*. Thank you guys for all the information and insight, it seems like I’m pretty off-base with what my idea of a marketing agency would look like for my business.",

Nobody is trying to overcharge you, but it ironically takes about the same amount of time to optimize an ad spend of $1k/month as it does $100k a month. And sometimes the $1k/month is harder to manage because you have no room for testing, experimentation, or risks/error, and it takes a long time to go through the cycle of test-->deploy-->measure, since your ads are reaching so few people and it might take days to know if your change really did anything useful.\n\nAnd from an ad management perspective, it's really hard to add sufficient value while also making it worth your time to manage it at all. If the ad spend is $1k and my fee is $1k, I have to at least double the effectiveness of your ads to make it worthwhile (while also not spending so much time on it that the $1k isn't worthwile. That's hard. Or in other words, if you didn't actively manage it, you could afford for it to perform twice as bad and the ROI would be the same.\n\nThat said, outsourcing here might be perfect. $1k goes a lot further in other areas of the world, and may get you someone with a lot more skill who is willing to spend a lot more time to optimize it correctly . Vet them very carefully of course - they can cause you a lot of problems too - but overall it might fit better for the scale you need.",

A lot of agencies charge those rates and then run cookie-cutter campaigns with zero strategy customization.\n\nWhat I've seen work well for local service businesses like lawn care is a hybrid model. Something like a smaller base retainer ($400-500/month) plus a per-lead bonus. That way the marketer has skin in the game but isn't working for free during the ramp-up period. It also filters out the agencies who don't actually believe in their own results because they'll refuse the bonus structure.\n\nFor lawn care specifically, your cost per lead on Meta should land somewhere around $15-35 depending on your market. If someone is quoting you management fees but can't tell you what CPL to expect in your area, that's a red flag. Ask them about their experience with service-area businesses and what kind of lead volume they've driven before. The good ones will have numbers ready.",

          "text": "You’re not crazy to want alignment. But the structure you’re proposing is why experienced operators won’t take the deal.\n\nIf you pay on percentage of closed jobs, the agency is carrying all the upfront labor while having no control over your response time, quoting process, close rate, or upsells. They control traffic and leads. You control revenue conversion. Tying their pay to your sales execution is a risk most seasoned agencies won’t accept.\n\nWhen you add required video production, you’re asking them to concept, shoot, edit, test, set up campaigns, configure tracking, and optimize before earning a dollar. That’s real labor and real cost. In effect, you’re asking another business to fund your growth with their time and expertise as an interest-free operational loan. Established operators don’t finance client businesses that way.\n\nAlso, “per lead” in lawn care is rarely clean. Some leads price shop. Some don’t answer. Some ghost after quotes. Who decides what counts? Those disputes are common in performance-only models.\n\nAs for the $800–$1,500 quotes, that’s not astronomical for Meta management. It covers strategy, creative testing, tracking setup, optimization, and reporting. The real money at risk isn’t the management fee. It’s your ad spend if campaigns are poorly structured\n\nHiring inexperienced people might feel cheaper, but if they haven’t managed real budgets over multiple months and corrected underperforming campaigns, you’re paying for their learning curve.\n\nIf you want serious talent, expect a monthly management fee plus ad budget and a defined testing window. If you insist on performance-only, you’ll mostly attract operators who have little leverage or little experience.",

You're in a difficult position and to be honest I think a motivated cousin that works for 30$ an hour will yield a better result than an agency.\n\nReason is you just need someone that has some marketing skills or is willing to learn and adapt quickly. You don't need to do anythig facy, just aim for a best practice and make it a little more unique/personal.\n\nAlso:  \nAssuming agency receives 100$ per lead. They need to deliver minimum 12 leads / month to make it worth their time.\n\nI'd even say 16 as they're taking on some risk by working on a variable basis.\n\nIf they need to spend 100-200$ per lead in ads, the minimum media budget is 1600-3200$. +1600$ in commissions to the agency.\n\n\n\nAssuming the hypothetical cousin is't terrible I'd imagine you get away with a cost per lead that might b a littl higher, but it's offset due to the big reduction in people cost. \n\nEve the most talented marketer will not be able to offset his high people cost vs the limited media budget.",

But you've got two 18 year olds willing to do it without a track record and that's exactly the kind of money that you're offering up. I dont say this to be mean. Its just the facts for the situation. \n\nHere's the other dilemma that you're going to face how much is each one of those contracts worth to you and how much would you pay them? Is it a high amount is it the $100 to $500 per 1 lead they could get getting leads for somebody who does say solar installations or Roofing? Would the percentage of any gigs that you get from it is high as the 2000$ to $4000 they would get from other Home Services on deals you close?\n\nYou should expect to pay at least a third of your gross revenue on things like your leads and incoming clientele marketing.\n\nSo this is the other Dilemma. If somebody is experienced and understands how to do your social media and you want them to film which is an entirely different area of expertise they're going to do it for clients who can pay them a lot more money for the same amount of work.\n\nNot to mention that with local Home Services it's more of a holistic approach between your Instagram and Facebook accounts mixed with your Google reviews and Google lead generation and then mix that with Google search and YouTube. And then add in the sprinkle of Yelp. So it's really like a whole thing and it's basically the most important thing that your company is going to have besides providing good services so yes it's going to cost you.\n\nI wish I had better news but I hope I laid it out in a pretty straightforward way of the problem you're going to run into. But somebody who's good at running ads and creating ads can get paid $80 to $150 pwr lead just sending those leads Nationwide to one of the lead services that you would probably be buying leads from. And they can make 20 grand to $500,000 a month. And maybe that can give you some perspective of why one client for $2,000 a month doesn't make much sense.\n\nThere are agencies that take on accounts but they'll probably charge a flat fee of like $2,000 a month plus 15% of AD spend and you're going to be required to spend at least 10 to $20,000 a month in ad spend. And even then it's going to be one of their guys in Pakistan or the Philippines running your campaigns. And then you'll have to pay $100 to $300 per ugc ad or video ad that you want to make at a minimum.\n\nThis is what I do for a living from A to Z companies in digital marketing from the ads all the way up to the leads.\n\nAnd unfortunately smaller ticket home services really just need to get basic internet presence done and then buy leads from one of these marketplaces and try and do their best to close them all.",
