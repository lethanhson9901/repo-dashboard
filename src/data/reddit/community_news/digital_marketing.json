      "text": "I'm hoping to get some advice from you guys because I'm completely lost on how this whole thing works. I've been posting a lot lately, but my followers are growing super slow. It feels like whenever real people visit my page, they see my tiny follower count and just leave without even looking at my posts. I'm starting to think that if I just had a bigger number, my profile would look more popular and people would actually want to stay and follow me. That is why I'm looking for a way to get free Instagram followers just to get things moving.   \n  \nI don't really know how any of this stuff operates behind the scenes. I just want a simple site where I can get some free followers to make my account look bigger and more established. I don't want to mess anything up or get my page banned because I don't fully understand it that well. Has anyone here actually figured out what site gives free Instagram followers without getting your account in trouble? Did having that bigger number actually help you attract real people afterwards? I'm just looking for a safe website that works because I don't want to pay for expensive marketing packages. Please let me know if you guys have any suggestions on what to do or where to go",

Usually, during valentines week, I see a lot of footfalls so this year I planned to advertise on google ads and meta (facebook/instagram). I advertised last year in early august because that is usually an off season and i don’t have a lot of customers. But i was shocked to see that my ads did much well in August than they’re doing right now. (ROAS was 3 in August but it’s barely scrapping by to 2 now, Conversion rate is down by 20%). I even hired a web developer and designer to design an attractive website connected to a landing page, asked my customers to leave a good review (in exchange of 5% discount) but now i’m really confused. I’ve done it all. Would it be a good idea to consult a marketing agency? I don’t have a lot of disposable funds right now but I can’t see any other option.",

Did your cost per click increase significantly?\n2. Is traffic quality similar, or are you reaching broader audiences?\n3. Are you seeing more window shoppers during peak season?\n4. Did average order value change?\n\nAlso, during gift-heavy seasons, timing matters a lot. Early planners behave differently from last-minute buyers.\n\nInstead of “I’ve done it all,” I’d isolate where the drop happened:\n\n– Traffic problem?  \n– Conversion problem?  \n– Cost problem?  \n– Offer problem?\n\nAgencies can help, but clarity on where the leak is will save you money before paying anyone else.",

When supply increases along with demand, costs go up. In August, there may be less competition, which could be one possible reason for better performance during that period.\n\nLess attractive Ad copy and creative as compare to competitors could also be a reason. Think of it this way: if people are seeing better ads compared to yours and have more attractive options in the market, they may still see your ads but not click on them. This results in a lower CTR, which increases costs and ultimately decreases ROAS.\n\nThese are the possible reasons based on my understanding, without knowing more details about your ads and business.\n\n5% off and conversion rate 20% down - For these occassion people not think about money more they think best of best product for their loved ones and if other people have better products and better way of messaging and ads they will get more.",

It's a sign that you were competing against every other gift shop in your market during the most expensive ad auction of the year for your category. CPMs during Valentine's week can easily 2-3x compared to off season. So the same ad that printed money in August will look mediocre when the auction is flooded.\n\nThe thing I'd actually look at is your repeat customer rate. A gift shop lives and dies by returning buyers. If someone bought from you last Valentine's, did you email them in January? Did you text them a week before with a \"your order from last year\" reminder? That's basically free revenue you're leaving on the table.\n\nAlso worth checking your Google Ads search terms report. During peak seasons you attract way more junk traffic from broad match queries. I'd bet you're paying for clicks from people searching for free printable cards or DIY gift ideas who were never going to buy anything.",

          "text": "This happens a lot, especially around busy holidays when competition and ad costs spike. It’s not always about the site or creative either, sometimes, bidding just gets too aggressive and your usual strategies stop working. Before you spend money on an agency, you might want to take a deep dive into your targeting and timing. Try narrowing your audience, tweaking your ad copy to speak directly to last-minute gifters, and maybe adjusting your budget to off-peak hours. Also, compare your August campaign settings with what you ran this time. Even small changes in geo, device, or placements can make a big difference. \n\nDon’t ignore platforms like Pinterest or even local groups on Facebook, as people shop for gifts there too. Setting up automated rules to pause underperforming ads can help stretch your budget. There are AI-powered tools like 4XDigital AI that can automate creative testing and optimize your campaigns across multiple channels, which is helpful if you’re strapped for time. But honestly, sometimes it just comes down to timing and market saturation. Keep testing, and don’t feel pressured to throw money at an agency unless you really hit a wall.",

Costs nothing, takes minutes.\n\nAlso consider: Are you bidding against bigger competitors now? Seasonal demand shifts fast. Try lowering bids, tightening audience targeting, or testing different ad creative angles. Sometimes it's not the strategy it's just saturation during peak season.

The second one is basically dark traffic and most tools cant capture it.\n\nWe've been building something at vectorgap that tracks share of voice across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and Perplexity simultaneously -- the cross-model view is what makes it useful imo because optimizing for one model can actually hurt you on another. Like Perplexity heavily weights source recency while Claude seems to care more about structured factual content.\n\nDid you test any of those four tools on multi-model tracking?

Helps with brainstorms, reports and what not\n* **Google Nano Banana:** Helps us replace items/things in the image without changing anything else. Great for consistent characters and subjects across multiple images! Can also \n* **Canva**: Yes, it gets clowned on sometimes, but honestly Canva is the best tool for non-designers who need fast creative. My team whips up ads, sales decks, and social content way faster here than waiting on design queues. \n* **Loom**: Can’t tell you how helpful it is for async communication and documentation to just record my screen while I’m taking and send it to someone. Hidden gem: AI transcription is a nice feature. These also work for recording product demos. \n* **Frizerlly**: Their AI agent can learn all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog on our website every day! We usually let is publish as a draft and manually switch it to published after a quick review! \n* **Hotjar**: If you’re not tracking how users move on your site, you’re flying blind. Heatmaps and recordings help me figure out why people bounce or where they get stuck. \n* **Zapier**: I’ve got zaps running for everything from lead routing to Slack alerts for new demo requests. The stuff it automates behind the scenes saves me from mind-numbing tasks. \n\nAnd that's about it! I know its not one but hope it helps someone :)",

Target very specific long-tail keywords instead of broad ones. A small site will almost never rank for something like “digital marketing”, but it can rank for “best free tools for local SEO in 2025” or “how to get first 100 visitors to a new website”.\n\n2. Answer search intent better than existing results. Don’t just write 500 words — create the most useful page on that topic (clear steps, examples, FAQs). Google tends to reward content that genuinely solves the problem.\n\n3. Distribute the content where your audience already is. Share the article in niche communities, forums, and places where people are already asking that question. A few early clicks and engagement can help the page get indexed and noticed faster.\n\nSEO feels overwhelming at first, but in reality consistent niche content + solving real problems compounds over time.",

Smaller sites usually win by going deep, not wide.\n\nA simple framework we’ve seen work:\n\n**1. Start with problem-first keyword clusters**  \nInstead of targeting one big keyword, build 5–10 pieces around one specific problem.  \nExample: rather than “AI for business”, create content like:  \n• AI workflow for recruiters  \n• AI data enrichment steps  \n• Automation mistakes beginners make  \nThis builds topical authority faster.\n\n**2. Publish “actionable” content, not generic content**  \nGoogle rewards usefulness. Checklists, templates, step-by-steps, and real workflows outperform theory posts.\n\n**3. Internal linking is underrated**  \nMost small sites publish posts but never connect them. Link every new article to 2–3 older ones. It helps crawling and increases time on site.\n\n**4. Update > publish more**  \nRefreshing an existing article (better examples, screenshots, FAQs) often drives more traffic than writing a new one.\n\n**5. Distribute where your audience already hangs out**  \nReddit, LinkedIn comments, niche communities. Not to sell — just to add context and insights. Consistent helpful participation builds authority and referral traffic.\n\n**6. Technical basics matter**  \nFast pages, clear headings, schema where relevant, and strong search intent alignment.\n\nOrganic growth for small sites is less about hacks and more about compounding useful content around a niche problem.\n\nCurious: what niche is your site in? The strategy changes a lot depending on that.",

One client with a 30 page site was outranking sites with thousands of pages because every single page was genuinely the best answer for its target query. Google rewards comprehensiveness on a per-page basis not a per-site basis.\n\nTechnical stuff that actually matters for small sites. Make sure your site loads fast on mobile because this is non-negotiable and most small sites are running bloated themes with 15 plugins that tank page speed. Clean up your title tags and meta descriptions so they're specific and compelling not generic. Set up proper internal linking between your pages so Google can understand how your content relates to each other. These three things take maybe a weekend to fix and they'll do more for your traffic than months of trying to build backlinks.\n\nFor tools keep it simple. Google Search Console is free and gives you everything you need to understand how Google sees your site. Ubersuggest or Ahrefs Lite for keyword research if you want to spend a little. AnswerThePublic to find questions people are asking about your topics. You don't need expensive enterprise tools at this stage.\n\nThe thing nobody tells small site owners is that consistency matters more than perfection. Publishing one solid well-researched post per week beats publishing a mediocre post every day. And updating your existing content every few months keeps it ranking better than constantly chasing new topics while old pages decay. Start there and you'll be ahead of 90% of small sites trying to game the algorithm instead of just being genuinely useful.",

Some brands dominate commercial intent queries but disappear on informational ones, and vice versa.\n\nRe your question about source weighting -- from what we see, GPT still heavily favors sources with strong topical authority and recent citations.

Websites are the center of digital marketing for any brand. \n\nFrom there I self taught Adobe for graphic design, completed Google Ad certificates and can pretty much run any ad campaign on social. \n\nI ended up being a “jack of many trades” and that has served me well.

Two of those conversations turned into paid work within a month because they already trusted me as a person.\n\nThe cold outreach advice here is solid, but most people skip the warmest leads they already have. Even if your network is small, you probably know someone who knows someone dealing with exactly the problem you solve. One good introduction beats 50 cold DMs.\n\nAfter those first few clients, then I started doing the \"find businesses with visible problems\" approach that others mentioned.

          "text": "Skip the platforms and branding at first. they take too long. pick one tiny niche you actually understand, like 'facebook ads for local dentists', and find 20 businesses in that niche. then just reach out directly. Not with a pitch, but with a specific observation about their current marketing and one idea to improve it. make it about them, not you. The goal is to start a conversation, not sell a service.\n\nhere's why this works: when you're starting from zero, you control only your actions. so focus on what you can do today. a micro-niche makes you an instant expert by comparison. for example, if you do seo, don't say 'seo services'. Say 'seo for independent bookstores in the pacific northwest'. Research those bookstores. find one obvious thing they're missing, maybe local schema markup or a broken blog link.\n\nIn your outreach, mention that. Say 'hey, noticed your site doesn't have local schema, that might be why you're not showing up in local pack results. implementing that is a straightforward fix. If you're interested, I can show you how.' You're not selling; You're teaching. That builds trust.\n\nDo this 20 times, you'll get a few conversations. From those, maybe one or two will turn into clients. It's a numbers game but with high intent. The value prop is clear because you're addressing a pain point they can see. Once you have three clients, deliver insane value so they refer others. Then you can think about branding.",

Customers are already searching for things on ChatGPt/Google, so if you can show up without ads, that's a win!\n\nFor SEO, honestly you just need Google Search Console! Figure out what your customers are already searching for based on GSC and Google ads data and write blogs on your website answering those questions really well! It's an iterative process and can take time  to build topical authority! If you want an advanced SEO tool, Semrush/Ahrehs is the usual rec but its super outdated imo! If you are looking for a more modern one, Frizerlly is great! They have an AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website!\n\nFinally, for existing customers, you can use tools like Mailchimp/Brevo to send recurring nurturing campaigns over email to upsell or create recurring purchases I guess! I personally like Brevo cause its cheaper!",

Like \"whats the best X for Y\" type queries. If your brand shows up in those AI answers, thats basically free qualified traffic with zero ad spend.\n\nThe wild part is that the signals AI models use to decide who to recommend are different from traditional SEO. Its more about being mentioned across reviews, forums, comparison sites.. not just ranking #1 on Google.\n\nWe track this at vectorgap across 5 AI models and its pretty eye-opening. Some brands that crush it on Google are completely invisible to ChatGPT and vice versa.\n\nFor simplest tools combo I would say: Google Search Console (free, essential), one keyword tool, and something to track your AI visibility. That covers traditional + the new AI-driven organic channel.\n\nDM me if you want to check how your brand shows up across the AI models, takes like 2 minutes",

What does your audience actually care about? where do they hang out online? start there with just a browser and a notepad. tools come later.\n\nOrganic marketing boils down to consistently showing up in the right places with valuable content. that means you need a way to plan, a way to publish, and a way to talk to people who respond. but you don't need integrated platforms. A disjointed but simple setup you actually use will beat a complex all-in-one system you avoid.\n\nIf you must think about tools, prioritize ones that do one thing well and don't force you into a million features you won't use. for example, a tool that just schedules posts is simpler than one that also tries to handle your email and crm. the bloat is real.\n\nThe reality is, organic growth is slow and manual at first. Embrace that. Ese basic spreadsheets for planning, native platform apps for engagement, and your own curiosity for research. when you hit a bottleneck, like spending too much time cross-posting, then you look for a tool to solve that specific pain. Until then, extra software is just a distraction from the real work: listening and helping.",

Most of the people selling them made their money selling courses, not doing marketing.\n\nI learned by just... doing it.

After that it's really about reps.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you is that DM isn't one skill. SEO is completely different from paid ads which is completely different from email marketing.

I started with just two things: the 'Senator We Run Ads' YouTube channel, one of the best places to learn and define your path in digital marketing, and Coursera (I took Google's 6-month Digital Marketing & E-commerce program).\nOnce I finished that program (which covers the basics and fundamentals), I moved on to the Google Ads and GA4 certifications. There are a ton of certs out there, but I recommend focusing on the main ones: Search, Display, Shopping, Measurement, and GA4.\nHowever, even after finishing the program and the certs, I only had a vague idea of the theory. I hadn't put any of it into practice aside from some small organic/social experiments. To really learn the complex stuff like CRM, marketing automation, and how to actually run Google/Meta Ads I took a 6-month internship at a digital agency. It was basically unpaid.\nDid I starve? Yes. But I learned a ton. It connected all the missing dots: I saw how digital channels work for real businesses, how to pull marketing levers, build campaigns, analyze data, create reports, and make data-driven decisions. From that point on, everything got much easier and the agency offered me a permanent contract.\nIn my experience, you need to be more of a generalist than a specialist to survive the AI era. You might start as a specialist in your role, but you need to understand how the entire ecosystem works. If you cover all the basics like SEO, Paid Ads, CRM/Email, Social, Analytics, and Attribution you’ll be able to pivot into almost any role in the future.\nHope that my experience helps. If you need more information send me a DM.",

Google is constantly tweaking which queries trigger them and which sources get cited. I've watched the same page appear in AIO for a query, disappear for two weeks, then come back.\n\nSo don't chase stability in a system that isn't stable yet. Focus on what you can control.\n\nThe biggest lever I've found is making sure the first 2-3 sentences of your content directly answer the query in plain language. AI Overviews love pulling clean, definitive statements. If your intro is fluffy or takes 200 words to get to the point, you're getting skipped.\n\nAlso, something practical: go check what your competitors' AIO citations actually look like. Open an incognito window, search the query, and read what Google is pulling. You'll usually notice the cited content is structured differently than typical SEO content. Shorter paragraphs, more factual, less keyword-stuffed.",

If competitors are getting featured, check whether they have multiple supporting pages around the same topic. Topical depth often matters more than a single backlink spike.\n\nSecond, structure helps, but it’s not magic.  \nClear H2s that match real questions. Short, direct answer blocks near the top. Tables where comparisons make sense. FAQ schema can help with clarity, but it won’t compensate for weak authority.\n\nBacklinks still matter, especially in competitive niches. But relevant, contextual links beat random link volume.\n\nFor ranking stability:\n\n* Reduce cannibalization across similar pages\n* Strengthen internal linking to your core page\n* Keep updating, but don’t constantly rewrite the whole page\n\nIn short, think entity + topic ownership, not just keyword optimization.

In practice, pages that get pulled into AI summaries usually do three things well: \n\n(1) tightly match search intent with concise, direct answers near the top of the page,\n\n (2) sit within a strong topical cluster (not isolated posts), and \n\n(3) demonstrate credibility signals (quality links, brand mentions, author expertise). Schema and FAQ markup don’t guarantee inclusion, but they *do* help Google parse your content more reliably, especially when paired with clean headings and scannable formatting. \n\nTo stabilize rankings, focus on building depth around one topic, refresh key pages regularly, strengthen internal linking between related content, and monitor which competitor pages are being cited then reverse-engineer their structure and answer style.

AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude actually decide what to show people and honestly it's so different from how Google works .( This is a basic explanation, will be diving into it more in my newsletter )\n\nbasically these AI tools don't just rank websites like Google does. They pull information from sources that are authoritative, detailed and actually useful for answering the specific question someone asked. Which means the whole traditional SEO game kind of shifts here.\n\nWhat actually matters for getting your product or business noticed by AI:\n\nYour product pages need to be really thorough. Like specs, pricing, reviews, availability, what makes you different. The more complete it is the better chance the AI picks it up when someone asks a relevant question.\n\nStructure your content properly. Headers, lists, tables, schema markup. AI models parse structured content way more easily than big walls of text.\n\nWrite content that actually answers questions people are asking. Detailed guides, comparisons, conversational explanations. Think about what someone would literally type into ChatGPT and make sure your content answers that.\n\nGet mentioned on credible sites. Backlinks and reviews from trusted sources signal that you're legit.( This one is pretty imp)\n\neverything should be updated. Stale outdated info gets ignored completely.\n\nAnd this thing is called GEO, Generative Engine Optimization, which is basically optimizing so that AI tools like ChatGPT and Google actually recommend and mention your brand when someone asks a relevant question. It's like SEO but for AI search instead of traditional Google rankings.\n\nwill be writing about this in detail in my newsletter , let me know if you are interested :)",

Instead of hunting for the perfect AI, build a simple system: define what your brand voice actually sounds like in writing, create a short style guide (tone, common phrases, what you'd never say), then use that as your quality filter for any tool output.\n\n\n\nFor service businesses especially, I'd start with the highest-touch communication first. Incoming calls and appointment booking matter more than social captions. That's where a voice receptionist trained on your actual business info, hours, and how you handle customer questions pays off immediately.

If it's seen it before, it doesn't really have any need to surface your information. \n\nWhen you have AI do the work, it can only talk about what it knows, so it's never really going to be able to generate anything useful for itself. I suppose Gemini might produce something that OpenAI could learn from or vice versa, but that doesn't really help us because we want to be useful everywhere. \n\nSo... you have to get all the stuff that connects the info back up the funnel to your brand at the top - and that's the \"new\" connection (or at least the foundation of it) that you're presenting in your content. If the AI was already capable of producing this content with all those connections intact, you don't need to produce the new content because it already knows. \n\nYou're going to need to be involved in content creation forever. (Or at least until the point where human interaction isn't needed for anything - but you'll still need to produce content with the message that our super AI is going to be sending for us). ",

Second month you've already caught the easy ones, and now a few other people found the pond too. The fish are still there, you just have to work a bit harder per catch.\n\nBut honestly the bigger issue is timing. If you wait until CPL rises to have this conversation, you've already lost. The client has already decided something is wrong. I started including a \"what to expect at 2x budget\" slide in every onboarding deck. Nothing fancy, just a simple chart showing that doubling spend typically gets you 1.5-1.7x the results, not 2x. Setting that expectation early means when it actually happens, the client goes \"oh right, you mentioned this\" instead of \"what went wrong.\"\n\nThe other thing that helps is reframing the metric. Instead of cost per lead going up, show total leads going up. Most clients care about volume more than efficiency anyway. If they went from 30 leads to 48 leads, that's a win even if each one cost a bit more.",

Creative is the ceiling. At low spend you can get by on novelty. At scale, you need a steady pipeline of fresh angles/hooks or CTR drops and CPM climbs.\n\n2. Audience saturation + frequency. You're just showing the same thing to the same people more often.\n\n3. Optimization event mismatch. You scale while optimizing for a shallow event (click/ATC), and it falls apart when you need actual purchase intent.\n\n4. Offer + landing page can't carry volume. your conversion rate is fine for warm traffic, but collapses for cold (trust, clarity, shipping, guarantee).\n\n5. Backend constraints. Slow site, inventory, shipping times, support delays, scale amplifies all of it.  \nRule of thumb: scaling isn't \"turn budget up.\" It's new creatives + broader proof + tighter conversion path.\n\nWhen your campaign collapsed, what moved first, CTR, CPM, CVR, or CPA? That usually tells you the real culprit.",

Meta's AI can process millions of real-time signals to find conversions in ways human media buyers simply cannot.\n\nBecause the AI has essentially taken over the audience targeting and bid optimization, the human strategy hasn't disappeared, it just shifted. Creative is the new targeting. You let the AI find the buyers, and you spend your human brainpower testing different angles, hooks, and ad copy. The algorithm learns who to target based purely on what creative they interact with.\n\nYou definitely shouldn't blindly trust it on day one.

          "text": "You’re spot on — AI is great for speed and volume, but there are still areas where human intuition beats AI in SEO research. Here’s how I draw the line in practice:\n\n1. Competitor analysis\nAI can scrape content, compare meta data, or show backlink profiles.\nHumans are better at qualitative insight: spotting gaps competitors aren’t exploiting, understanding tone, intent, or UX differences. For example, two sites might rank for the same keyword, but one converts better because of layout or copy nuance — AI can’t fully see that.\n\n2. Keyword research + user intent mapping\nAI can generate keyword lists fast.\nHumans interpret why someone searches something, not just what they type.\nExample: “best coffee grinder” — are users looking to buy, compare, or learn about maintenance? Only human research, using forums, reviews, Reddit threads, can map intent accurately.\n\n3. Content strategy / angle discovery\nAI can spin ideas or outline topics.\nHumans identify differentiation: what angle competitors haven’t covered, trends in micro-niches, cultural context, local relevance. This is where thought leadership and long-tail opportunity comes from.\n\n4. Link / outreach opportunities\nAI can pull contact info or suggest sites.\nHumans figure out relationship potential: who’s likely to link or collaborate, which sites align with your audience, and how to craft a personalized pitch. AI is blunt here.\n\n5. Trend spotting / emerging signals\nAI is trained on historical data.\nHumans notice tiny signals before they’re in algorithms — new forums, subreddits, micro-influencers, early product launches, or changing user behavior.",

But I'd still approach it with a very high amount of skepticism, especially if you are paying up front.\n\nGenerally speaking, most of these \"accelerator\" type of programs are basically just repackaging certification programs that you can already get for free and better from the direct source. Google Marketing certifications (free from Google), Hubspot certifications (free from hubspot), various courses from Facebook/Meta and Salesforce (Trailblazer), etc. \n\nSo from that perspective, getting the actual certification would be a lot more reputable and broadly applicable than some certificate from a for-profit group nobody has heard about.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m an independent filmmaker working with a small youth team. We have our own production team called Montage Motion Pictures. We’ve been producing short films and, الحمدلله, we’ve been fortunate enough to win some international awards.\n\nOur main problem right now is marketing and audience growth.\n\nWe do all our marketing ourselves because we don’t have the budget to hire social media managers or content creators. Our team is very small, and our main focus is writing, shooting, and editing films. On top of that, we’re also handling everything else like graphic design, editing social media videos, posters, and managing accounts.\n\nThe issue is that despite putting a lot of effort into our content, our views and followers are still very low.\n\nFE, I created a short AI video imagining our film’s main character as if he was a character in Fortnite. It was just for fun and didn’t represent the real film or our usual style.\n\nBut surprisingly, that video got significantly more views than our actual film content and official posts.\n\nThis made us question a lot of things:\n\nAre we approaching content the wrong way?\n\nDo audiences connect more with entertaining / trend-based content than with actual film content?\n\nAre we being too serious with our marketing?\n\nWe’d really appreciate honest feedback and advice:\n\n* What do you think could be the problem?\n* How important is posting frequency vs content quality?\n* Should filmmakers focus on “secondary content” even if it’s not their main passion?\n* How do you balance filmmaking and content creation without burning out?\n\nAnother important point: we are Arab filmmakers.\n\n* How can we reach non-Arabic speaking audiences?\n* Is it necessary to create a separate English account, or is bilingual content enough?\n\nAlso, we’re considering creating an AI UGC avatar to act as the “public face” of our brand and represent our production team online.\n\n* Do you recommend this?\n* If yes, what style, age, and personality would work best for a film production brand targeting young audiences?\n\nFinally, the most important question:\n\nHow can we create strong, effective content without extreme pressure and burnout?\n\nIf anyone is willing to review our account and give honest criticism, we’d be very grateful.\n\nThank you so much.\n\ninstagram: \"@montage\\_mpictures\"  \ntiktok: \"@montage\\_pictures\"",

          "text": "First, congrats on the awards. That tells me the filmmaking is strong. This sounds more like a distribution issue than a quality issue. Film content and social content are different games. Social platforms reward personality, process, and native content, not just polished final work. The Fortnite-style clip likely worked because it felt platform-native. A few quick thoughts: Do not use social only as a trailer feed. Show behind the scenes, writing process, challenges, and character stories. Secondary content is not a distraction. It is how people discover you. For non-Arab audiences, strong subtitles and occasional bilingual captions are usually enough. A separate account can split growth early on. I would avoid an AI avatar. For filmmakers, real faces and authentic stories usually connect more. Keep it simple to avoid burnout. ",
