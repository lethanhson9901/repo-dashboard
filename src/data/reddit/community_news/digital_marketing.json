      "text": "I've been in digital marketing for years and here's something I've been thinking about a lot lately: we've created an entire industry around convincing every single business that they NEED to be on social media. But do they really?\n\nI've worked with local service businesses - plumbers, electricians, dentists - who were spending $2-3k/month on social media management. Their Instagram had maybe 800 followers, most of whom would never use their services. Their posts got 10-20 likes. And they were paying someone to create content every single week.\n\nMeanwhile, the same $2-3k invested in Google Ads or local SEO was bringing in actual leads that converted to paying customers.\n\nHere's what I've noticed:\n\n**Businesses where social media actually matters:**\n- D2C brands where visual content drives purchases\n- Personal brands and creators\n- Restaurants and food businesses (people share food content naturally)\n- Fashion, beauty, lifestyle\n- B2B companies using LinkedIn for thought leadership\n\n**Businesses where social media is mostly a waste:**\n- Local service businesses (plumbing, HVAC, legal)\n- B2B industrial/manufacturing\n- Niche professional services\n- Any business where the customer journey starts with a Google search, not a social feed\n\nThe problem is that agencies won't tell you this because social media management is recurring revenue for them. It's much easier to sell \"you need to post 3x a week\" than to say \"actually, put that budget into SEO and you'll get better results.\"\n\nI'm not saying social media is useless. I'm saying it's not universally necessary, and we should be more honest about which businesses actually benefit from it.\n\nAm I wrong here? Would love to hear from other marketers who've seen both sides.",

          "text": "You are not wrong. I would actually push this further and say the social media question should come AFTER a business figures out where their customers actually discover them. For most local service businesses the answer is Google, referrals, and maybe Nextdoor. Social media is nowhere in that journey.\n\nThe one nuance I would add is that social media for local businesses can work as a trust signal even if it never drives direct leads. When someone Googles a plumber and finds two options, one with an active Facebook page showing real job photos and one with nothing, they are probably picking the first one. But that requires maybe 2-3 posts a month, not a $2k managed strategy.\n\nThe real problem is the agency incentive structure you mentioned. Monthly retainers on social media management are predictable revenue. Telling a client \"honestly just post a job photo once a week yourself\" is good advice but bad for the agency's bottom line. Until agencies start getting paid on outcomes instead of deliverables this dynamic will not change.",

Still plenty of opportunity for businesses that don't have a digital presence and have strong word of mouth, especially if they don't want to grow (some people just don't want the hassle).\n\nGetting a business online should be a strategic decision, not \"everyone else is there, so we should be too.\" Marketing needs to have ROI. Marketing that doesn't get ROI isn't really marketing. If social media isn't working and ads/Google Business profile are ... why wouldn't you do the thing that works?\n\nWorth noting, though, that there are reasons you might want to build up your presence on socials. If those platforms are indexed on search, you might be able to boost your visibility on search/LLMs. And it's easier to sell someone on the idea of buying a business with a strong digital presence than one without one. A lot of Boomers are looking for exits.",

          "text": "Skip the platforms and branding at first. they take too long. pick one tiny niche you actually understand, like 'facebook ads for local dentists', and find 20 businesses in that niche. then just reach out directly. Not with a pitch, but with a specific observation about their current marketing and one idea to improve it. make it about them, not you. The goal is to start a conversation, not sell a service.\n\nhere's why this works: when you're starting from zero, you control only your actions. so focus on what you can do today. a micro-niche makes you an instant expert by comparison. for example, if you do seo, don't say 'seo services'. Say 'seo for independent bookstores in the pacific northwest'. Research those bookstores. find one obvious thing they're missing, maybe local schema markup or a broken blog link.\n\nIn your outreach, mention that. Say 'hey, noticed your site doesn't have local schema, that might be why you're not showing up in local pack results. implementing that is a straightforward fix. If you're interested, I can show you how.' You're not selling; You're teaching. That builds trust.\n\nDo this 20 times, you'll get a few conversations. From those, maybe one or two will turn into clients. It's a numbers game but with high intent. The value prop is clear because you're addressing a pain point they can see. Once you have three clients, deliver insane value so they refer others. Then you can think about branding.",

Two of those conversations turned into paid work within a month because they already trusted me as a person.\n\nThe cold outreach advice here is solid, but most people skip the warmest leads they already have. Even if your network is small, you probably know someone who knows someone dealing with exactly the problem you solve. One good introduction beats 50 cold DMs.\n\nAfter those first few clients, then I started doing the \"find businesses with visible problems\" approach that others mentioned.

When you narrow down, your outreach feels like it was written for that specific person, because it was.\n\n\n\nFor cold outreach specifically, the method that worked for me was going hyper local. Find businesses in a specific area that have a visible gap, a slow response time, bad reviews mentioning a recurring issue, an outdated website, whatever. Then reach out referencing exactly that. Generic outreach gets ignored. Specific observations get replies.\n\n\n\nThe research part used to eat most of my time honestly. I recently started using a tool called Lead-Radar (lead-radar.fr) that pulls businesses from Google Maps by keyword and location, finds their contact emails and even generates a short brief on each prospect with potential pain points. Cuts the research phase from hours to minutes which means more time actually writing good emails.\n\n\n\nFreelance platforms can work too but the competition kills your margins early on. Personal branding takes too long when you need clients this week.\n\n\n\nDirect outreach with a specific observation and a clear offer is still the fastest path in my experience.\n\n\n\nWhat type of clients are you trying to land, local businesses or remote?",

A small site will almost never rank for something like “digital marketing”, but it can rank for “best free tools for local SEO in 2025” or “how to get first 100 visitors to a new website”.\n\n2. Answer search intent better than existing results. Don’t just write 500 words — create the most useful page on that topic (clear steps, examples, FAQs). Google tends to reward content that genuinely solves the problem.\n\n3. Distribute the content where your audience already is. Share the article in niche communities, forums, and places where people are already asking that question. A few early clicks and engagement can help the page get indexed and noticed faster.\n\nSEO feels overwhelming at first, but in reality consistent niche content + solving real problems compounds over time.",

Go after specific long-tail searches that clearly show intent. It’s much easier to rank for “best budgeting app for freelancers in Texas” than “budgeting app.” Small sites win by being specific.\n\nSecond, build **topical clusters**, not random articles. Pick one core topic and create 5–10 tightly related pieces that internally link to each other. This builds topical authority faster than publishing scattered content.\n\nThird, optimize for **clarity and usefulness**, not tricks.

          "text": "Stop trying to do everything at once. Small sites win by being hyper focused not by spreading thin across every SEO tactic you've read about.\n\nThe single biggest lever for a small site is choosing the right keywords to go after. You're not going to rank for \"best running shoes\" against Nike and Wirecutter. But you can absolutely rank for specific long tail stuff that bigger sites don't bother targeting. Think \"best running shoes for flat feet on concrete\" level of specificity. Use Google Search Console if you have it connected already and look at what queries you're actually showing impressions for. Those are your quick wins because Google is already considering you for those terms, you just need to strengthen those pages.\n\nContent depth on a small number of topics beats shallow coverage across dozens. Pick 3 to 5 core topics and become the most thorough resource on the internet for those specific things. We've seen our clients with small sites outrank massive competitors by going deeper not wider. One client with a 30 page site was outranking sites with thousands of pages because every single page was genuinely the best answer for its target query. Google rewards comprehensiveness on a per-page basis not a per-site basis.\n\nTechnical stuff that actually matters for small sites. Make sure your site loads fast on mobile because this is non-negotiable and most small sites are running bloated themes with 15 plugins that tank page speed. Clean up your title tags and meta descriptions so they're specific and compelling not generic. Set up proper internal linking between your pages so Google can understand how your content relates to each other. These three things take maybe a weekend to fix and they'll do more for your traffic than months of trying to build backlinks.\n\nFor tools keep it simple. Google Search Console is free and gives you everything you need to understand how Google sees your site. Ubersuggest or Ahrefs Lite for keyword research if you want to spend a little. AnswerThePublic to find questions people are asking about your topics. You don't need expensive enterprise tools at this stage.\n\nThe thing nobody tells small site owners is that consistency matters more than perfection. Publishing one solid well-researched post per week beats publishing a mediocre post every day. And updating your existing content every few months keeps it ranking better than constantly chasing new topics while old pages decay. Start there and you'll be ahead of 90% of small sites trying to game the algorithm instead of just being genuinely useful.",

Customers are already searching for things on ChatGPt/Google, so if you can show up without ads, that's a win!\n\nFor SEO, honestly you just need Google Search Console! Figure out what your customers are already searching for based on GSC and Google ads data and write blogs on your website answering those questions really well! It's an iterative process and can take time  to build topical authority! If you want an advanced SEO tool, Semrush/Ahrehs is the usual rec but its super outdated imo! If you are looking for a more modern one, Frizerlly is great! They have an AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website!\n\nFinally, for existing customers, you can use tools like Mailchimp/Brevo to send recurring nurturing campaigns over email to upsell or create recurring purchases I guess!

The payouts themselves are generally reliable and the minimum payout can be as low as ~$10 depending on the program, with PayPal or bank transfer options. \n\nThat said, the complaints you’re seeing are real. The platform is pretty “enterprise-style,” so the UI can feel clunky and there’s a learning curve. Smaller affiliates also don’t get much support, so ticket responses can be slow. \n\nApproval-wise: Impact approves you as a publisher, but you still have to apply to each advertiser individually. So getting accepted mostly depends on the brand, not Impact itself. \n\nMy take:\n\nWorth joining if the brands you want to promote are there.\nNot the most beginner-friendly network.\nGood as a secondary network, not the only one you rely on.\n\nA lot of affiliates run it alongside CJ / ShareASale / PartnerStack rather than replacing them.",

Google doesn’t need help understanding keywords anymore. It needs help understanding who to trust.\n\nA few things that are actually working for me right now:\n\n**1. Topical authority > isolated posts**\n\nI’ve stopped publishing random “low KD” articles. Instead, I build clusters around one tight theme and go deep. Not just surface-level “what is X,” but:\n\n* real examples\n* use cases\n* mistakes\n* comparisons\n* updated stats\n* FAQs pulled from real queries\n\nWhen your site clearly *owns* a topic, rankings stick way better.\n\n**2. First-hand experience is underrated**\n\nGoogle’s whole E-E-A-T thing isn’t theory anymore. Pages where I include:\n\n* screenshots\n* real data\n* experiments\n* lessons learned\n\n…consistently outperform generic AI-written explainers.\n\nYou can still use AI. But if you’re not adding perspective, you’re competing with 10,000 near-identical articles.\n\n**3. Search intent matching > word count**\n\nLong-form doesn’t automatically win anymore.\n\nIf someone searches “best CRM for freelancers,” they don’t want a 4,000-word essay. They want:\n\n* quick comparison\n* pricing\n* pros/cons\n* who it’s for\n\nI’ve actually cut word count on some pages and improved rankings.\n\n**4. UX is no longer optional**\n\nCore Web Vitals, layout stability, fast load times; that’s baseline now. But beyond that:\n\n* Clean formatting\n* No aggressive popups\n* Clear navigation\n* Logical internal linking\n\nGoogle can measure satisfaction signals better than we think.\n\n**5. Brand + direct traffic matters more**\n\nThe sites that win long-term are building an audience, not just ranking.\n\nEmail list. Social presence. Community.  \nWhen people search your brand name directly, that’s a massive trust signal.\n\n**6. Programmatic SEO still works (if it’s actually helpful)**\n\nThin templated pages are dying. But structured, useful programmatic pages with unique value? Still crushing it in niches like local, SaaS integrations, marketplaces, etc.\n\nWhat I’m seeing die in 2026:\n\n* Mass AI content with no edits\n* Expired domain tricks\n* Parasite SEO\n* “Publish 100 articles in 30 days” strategies\n\nWhat’s winning:\n\n* Depth\n* Clarity\n* Credibility\n* Real experience\n* Clean UX\n\nHonestly, SEO feels harder… but also more fair. If you build something genuinely useful, you have a shot.\n\nCurious, are you seeing more volatility this year, or has it stabilized for you?",

While newer platforms like social media and influencer marketing get a lot of attention, email marketing continues to deliver strong ROI and engagement.\n\n# Why email marketing still works:\n\n1. **Direct Access to Customers**: You have a direct line to your audience's inbox, which is way more personal and powerful than relying on social algorithms.\n2. **Highly Targeted**: With email segmentation, you can send tailored content based on customer behavior, interests, or past purchases, leading to higher conversion rates.\n3. **Cost-Effective**: Compared to ads or influencer campaigns, email marketing is super cost-efficient, especially for small businesses.\n4. **Measurable Results**: You can track open rates, click-through rates, and conversions, which helps you continuously improve your strategy.\n5. **Staying Relevant**: Even with new communication tools, email remains one of the most trusted and frequently used methods for businesses to reach customers.\n\nIn short, email marketing in 2026 is far from underrated—it's an essential tool for businesses looking to engage with their audience in a personal, effective, and measurable way!",

We've also seen that restructuring campaigns at higher budgets (breaking out by placement or objective rather than just cranking the daily budget) helps the algorithm avoid that \"going broad\" death spiral. Basically scaling isn't a budget decision, it's an infrastructure decision.   \n  \nwhen you've seen fatigue hit at $500/day, are you typically running broad or interest-stacked audiences? ",

Creative is the ceiling. At low spend you can get by on novelty. At scale, you need a steady pipeline of fresh angles/hooks or CTR drops and CPM climbs.\n\n2. Audience saturation + frequency. You're just showing the same thing to the same people more often.\n\n3. Optimization event mismatch. You scale while optimizing for a shallow event (click/ATC), and it falls apart when you need actual purchase intent.\n\n4. Offer + landing page can't carry volume. your conversion rate is fine for warm traffic, but collapses for cold (trust, clarity, shipping, guarantee).\n\n5. Backend constraints. Slow site, inventory, shipping times, support delays, scale amplifies all of it.  \nRule of thumb: scaling isn't \"turn budget up.\" It's new creatives + broader proof + tighter conversion path.\n\nWhen your campaign collapsed, what moved first, CTR, CPM, CVR, or CPA?

Entity clarity > raw backlinks (in many cases).\n\nBacklinks still matter. \nBut I’ve seen lower DR sites get featured because their content is tighter and more aligned to the query intent.\nIf your brand/entity isn’t clearly associated with the topic, AI Overviews may skip you even if you rank.\n\nOn ranking fluctuations\n\nStability lately comes from:\n\n•\tUpdating content more frequently\n•\tPruning overlapping pages (keyword cannibalization is brutal now)\n•\tStrengthening internal linking within topic clusters\n•\tTightening search intent alignment\n\nIf rankings swing hard, check:\n\n•\tAre you mixing informational + commercial intent?\n•\tAre competitors refreshing content more often?\n•\tAre you over-optimizing for keywords instead of answering the actual question?",

Focus on what you can control.\n\nThe biggest lever I've found is making sure the first 2-3 sentences of your content directly answer the query in plain language. AI Overviews love pulling clean, definitive statements. If your intro is fluffy or takes 200 words to get to the point, you're getting skipped.\n\nAlso, something practical: go check what your competitors' AIO citations actually look like. Open an incognito window, search the query, and read what Google is pulling. You'll usually notice the cited content is structured differently than typical SEO content. Shorter paragraphs, more factual, less keyword-stuffed.",

Tables where comparisons make sense. FAQ schema can help with clarity, but it won’t compensate for weak authority.\n\nBacklinks still matter, especially in competitive niches. But relevant, contextual links beat random link volume.\n\nFor ranking stability:\n\n* Reduce cannibalization across similar pages\n* Strengthen internal linking to your core page\n* Keep updating, but don’t constantly rewrite the whole page\n\nIn short, think entity + topic ownership, not just keyword optimization.

Schema and FAQ markup don’t guarantee inclusion, but they *do* help Google parse your content more reliably, especially when paired with clean headings and scannable formatting. \n\nTo stabilize rankings, focus on building depth around one topic, refresh key pages regularly, strengthen internal linking between related content, and monitor which competitor pages are being cited then reverse-engineer their structure and answer style.

AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude actually decide what to show people and honestly it's so different from how Google works .( This is a basic explanation, will be diving into it more in my newsletter )\n\nbasically these AI tools don't just rank websites like Google does. They pull information from sources that are authoritative, detailed and actually useful for answering the specific question someone asked. Which means the whole traditional SEO game kind of shifts here.\n\nWhat actually matters for getting your product or business noticed by AI:\n\nYour product pages need to be really thorough. Like specs, pricing, reviews, availability, what makes you different. The more complete it is the better chance the AI picks it up when someone asks a relevant question.\n\nStructure your content properly. Headers, lists, tables, schema markup. AI models parse structured content way more easily than big walls of text.\n\nWrite content that actually answers questions people are asking. Detailed guides, comparisons, conversational explanations. Think about what someone would literally type into ChatGPT and make sure your content answers that.\n\nGet mentioned on credible sites. Backlinks and reviews from trusted sources signal that you're legit.( This one is pretty imp)\n\neverything should be updated. Stale outdated info gets ignored completely.\n\nAnd this thing is called GEO, Generative Engine Optimization, which is basically optimizing so that AI tools like ChatGPT and Google actually recommend and mention your brand when someone asks a relevant question. It's like SEO but for AI search instead of traditional Google rankings.\n\nwill be writing about this in detail in my newsletter , let me know if you are interested :)",

Llevamos varios años viendo cómo el contenido publicado bajo un nombre de persona genera más engagement que el publicado bajo un logo corporativo en prácticamente todas las plataformas: LinkedIn, Twitter/X, YouTube, e incluso en búsqueda orgánica donde los autores con E-E-A-T consolidado tienen ventaja.\n\n\n\nEl motivo es psicológico antes que algorítmico: la gente sigue a personas, no a empresas. Una marca personal comunica perspectiva, opinión y experiencia de primera mano, cosas que el contenido corporativo evita por miedo a la controversia. Esa fricción entre \"lo que la empresa puede decir\" y \"lo que el especialista realmente piensa\" es donde la marca personal gana.\n\n\n\nDesde el punto de vista de marketing digital, lo que estamos viendo es el auge del modelo de \"marca paraguas\": una empresa que cultiva las marcas personales de sus empleados clave y luego las conecta con la marca corporativa. Es lo que hacen bien empresas como HubSpot o Ahrefs, cuyos especialistas son más conocidos que la propia empresa en algunos nichos.\n\n\n\nEl riesgo es la dependencia: si el experto se va, se lleva la audiencia. Por eso las empresas inteligentes construyen los dos canales en paralelo, usando la marca personal como punta de lanza para generar confianza y la marca corporativa para convertir y retener. No es una competencia, son capas complementarias del mismo funnel.",

I need to attach my personal brand to entities like you need to connect any entity - but it doesn't need to be a business. I've white labeled my services for virtually my entire career so I actually come up attached to several different brands. \n\nSo what you're seeing is probably somewhat accurate - personal branding probably does outperform company branding in a lot of cases, but it's because brand identities often skip attaching people with expertise behind the brand.

Especially in B2B and professional services.\n\nWhy it's happening:\n\n1. People buy from people, not logos. A founder or expert with a personal brand feels more authentic than a faceless company account.\n2. Algorithm favoritism. LinkedIn, X, and Instagram prioritize personal accounts over business pages. Your personal post will get 5–10x the reach of the same post from your company page.\n3. Trust has shifted. People trust individual experts more than brand messaging. They want to see the humans behind the company.\n4. Content flexibility. Personal brands can share opinions, behind-the-scenes, and personality. Company brands have to stay “on message” and corporate.\n\nReal examples from our clients:\n\n* CEO’s LinkedIn posts driving 70% of qualified leads while company page drives 10%\n* Founder’s personal brand landing partnership deals before the company website even gets looked at\n* Team members with personal brands being headhunted, which actually helps company recruiting (“your team is impressive”)\n\nThe catch:\n\nPersonal branding works if you're willing to show up consistently. It's not a shortcut. You can't automate personality.\n\nAnd there's risk: if that person leaves, the audience often goes with them.\n\nThe smart play:\n\nBuild both. Let key team members (founders, executives, subject matter experts) build personal brands that elevate the company brand. The personal brands drive trust and leads. The company brand provides stability and credibility.\n\nPersonal brand gets you in the door. Company brand closes the deal.\n\nIs this a long-term shift?\n\nYes. We're not going back to trusting faceless corporations over individual experts. If anything, this trend accelerates as AI-generated content floods the market and people crave authentic human voices even more.",

          "text": "Short answer?\n\nYes.  \nBut not in the way most people think.\n\nPersonal branding isn’t “beating” company branding.  \nIt’s outperforming it in attention, trust, and speed.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who works with founders and businesses on positioning.\n\n\n\nHere’s what’s actually happening.\n\nPeople don’t trust logos.  \nThey trust faces.\n\nThey don’t connect with taglines.  \nThey connect with stories.\n\nThey don’t follow companies.  \nThey follow people inside companies.\n\nThat shift is huge.\n\n\n\nFrom what I’ve seen:\n\nA company account might post 3 times a week and get polite engagement.\n\nThe founder posts once with a real opinion or lived experience?\n\n10x reach.  \nMore comments.  \nMore DMs.  \nMore actual conversations.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause humans are wired for humans.\n\n\n\nBut here’s the nuance most people miss:\n\nPersonal branding works best when it feeds the company brand.\n\nNot when it replaces it.\n\nThe strongest strategy today looks like this:\n\n1. A founder builds trust publicly.\n2. The audience connects with the founder.\n3. The founder points toward the company.\n4. The company becomes credible by association.\n\nIt’s a bridge.\n\nNot a competition.\n\n\n\nIf you’re deciding where to focus, here’s a simple guide:\n\nIf you’re early-stage:  \n→ Build the personal brand first.  \nIt’s faster, cheaper, and more flexible.\n\nIf you’re scaling:  \n→ Build both.  \nLet the personal brand drive awareness.  \nLet the company brand handle structure and scale.\n\nIf you’re hiding behind a logo:  \n→ That’s a mistake in 2026.\n\n\n\nHere’s the uncomfortable truth:\n\nIn crowded markets,  \nthe founder is often the differentiator.\n\nYour product can be copied.  \nYour pricing can be matched.  \nYour messaging can be mimicked.\n\nYour perspective can’t.\n\nThat’s why personal branding feels like it’s “outperforming.”\n\nIt’s not louder.  \nIt’s more believable.\n\n\n\nHere is my Final take:\n\nCompany branding builds infrastructure.  \nPersonal branding builds influence.\n\nInfluence travels faster.\n\nAnd in today’s attention economy, speed of trust matters.\n\nSo no, personal branding isn’t replacing company branding.\n\nBut if you ignore it, you’re choosing to grow slower.\n\nHope that helps.",

No editing, no original angle, no understanding of why the copy works or does not. That is the \"identical content\" problem you are noticing. You can spot AI assisted content that had no human judgment layered on top from a mile away.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that AI exposes the gap between people who were already good at strategy and people who were just good at execution. If your entire value was writing decent copy quickly, yeah, that is getting commoditized fast. But if your value was knowing WHAT to write and WHY, AI just made you more dangerous.\n\nFor me personally, the biggest improvement has been in analysis and research speed, not content generation.

Smaller audiences get tapped out, frequency climbs, and auctions get tighter. But to a business owner, it can feel like something broke.\n\nOne recent example was a local service client who wanted to double spend after a strong first month. The second month still performed well, just not at the same efficiency. That shift sparked more anxiety than the first month created excitement.\n\nSo that got us wondering how others are handling that moment.\n\nAre you setting expectations about marginal efficiency before scaling?

Second month you've already caught the easy ones, and now a few other people found the pond too. The fish are still there, you just have to work a bit harder per catch.\n\nBut honestly the bigger issue is timing. If you wait until CPL rises to have this conversation, you've already lost. The client has already decided something is wrong. I started including a \"what to expect at 2x budget\" slide in every onboarding deck. Nothing fancy, just a simple chart showing that doubling spend typically gets you 1.5-1.7x the results, not 2x. Setting that expectation early means when it actually happens, the client goes \"oh right, you mentioned this\" instead of \"what went wrong.\"\n\nThe other thing that helps is reframing the metric. Instead of cost per lead going up, show total leads going up. Most clients care about volume more than efficiency anyway. If they went from 30 leads to 48 leads, that's a win even if each one cost a bit more.",

That’s why it *feels* like organic doesn’t work anymore.\n\nPaid amplification isn’t automatically necessary but it becomes useful once you’ve proven messaging. The mistake most early brands make is running ads before they’ve validated hooks, positioning, and audience resonance organically. Paid traffic amplifies what already converts; it doesn’t fix weak positioning.\n\nWhat *is* working organically right now:\n\n* Founder-led content (faces + opinions outperform logos)\n* Narrow ICP targeting (speak to one type of person, not everyone)\n* Problem-first content, not product-first\n* High repetition of a core theme\n* Direct engagement (comments, DMs, community replies)",
