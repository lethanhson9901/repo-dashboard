People who share these hacks often leave out the context, existing audience, budget, or prior traction.\n\nAnother one I’ve seen is *“build in public and customers will come.”* It can help with trust, but without a clear ICP and problem, it often just builds an audience of other marketers, not buyers.\n\nAs an intern, the biggest realization for me has been that real marketing isn’t about hacks, it’s about **doing unglamorous fundamentals well** (clear positioning, good copy, decent distribution) for a long time. The “hack” is usually just consistency + patience, which isn’t very sellable online.",

And if you are getting DMs from reddit agencies please evaluate them carefully cuz anyone promising quick results will get your domain or brand name banned from the whole platform, understand their approach well before deciding, most of my clients get burned when they get promised leads and visibility in a month and have their whole domain banned on here cuz of the agency's spam acitivtity.",

Add UTM tags and a campaign ID to every link so the CRM can tie activity to the right campaign. Match on email plus a contact ID if you have one to avoid dupes. Do a one-time backfill, then switch to real time. We’ve done this for landscapers and turf shops and it’s smooth once naming and fields are set.

No pattern I could see.\n\nStarted second guessing everything. Is my personality boring? Is my voice annoying? Am I just not entertaining enough? Stopped enjoying the process. Just felt anxious and defeated.\n\nHit my breaking point 2 weeks ago. Either figure out what's wrong or quit. Looked at my retention graphs for real this time. Not just glanced. Actually studied them.\n\nEvery video that died lost people at second 7 to 9. Every video that worked held people past second 10. Watched what I was doing between second 7 and 9 in my failed videos.\n\nPausing. Visual not changing. Still explaining instead of showing. Watched what I was doing in my successful videos. Moving fast. Visual changing. Delivering value immediately.\n\nFixed my failed videos' problems. Made everything like my successful ones. Next 5 videos all hit over 15k views. My confidence came back immediately.\n\nHere's what fixed it for me.\n\n**Lack of confidence comes from not knowing why you're failing.** When you don't know what's wrong you start thinking everything's wrong. You're not. Something specific is wrong and you just can't see it.\n\n**Success builds confidence faster than anything.** One video that works because you actually knew how to fix it matters more than ten motivational posts. Fix what's broken. Post something that works. Confidence returns.\n\n**You need to see your blind spots.** I couldn't see my pauses were too long. I couldn't see my visuals were too static. They felt normal to me. I needed external feedback that was specific not just \"make better content.\"\n\n**Get something that shows you the actual problem.** Started using TikAlyzser that tells you exactly what's wrong with your videos and what to change to get more views. Second 8 pause 1.5 seconds visual static 6 seconds. Then I knew exactly what to fix. Not guessing. Knowing.\n\n**Post with confidence because you already fixed what would have killed it.** Now I post knowing it's going to work because I caught the problems before they went live. That confidence shows in my content. People can tell.\n\nLast 12 videos all over 10k views. Confidence is completely back. Enjoying creating again.\n\nIf posting fills you with dread instead of excitement something's broken and you don't know what it is. Fix that first. Confidence comes back fast after that.",

Douglas walked up to her and said, \"I need to poop.\" \"Okay,\" Rebecca replied, \"I like poop.\" Douglas squatted down over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop.

It was wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all. The pee-pee got on the woman's leg and she screamed, pooping out her boobs. And so when the pee got mixed with the poop it smelled like a butt.

What you described is exactly how confidence erosion actually happens — not from “lack of discipline,” but from **lack of clarity**.\n\nWhen you don’t know *why* something fails, your brain fills in the gaps with self-blame. Personality, voice, intelligence, talent — everything becomes suspect. That’s brutal mentally, especially when you’re doing the “right” thing by showing up daily.\n\nWhat stood out most is the **specificity** of the fix. Second 7–9 drop-off, static visuals, pausing too long. That’s actionable. “Make better content” never helps anyone — knowing *what moment loses people* does.\n\nI also think your point about confidence being a **byproduct of competence** is underrated. Motivation doesn’t fix confidence. Seeing something work because you understood and corrected a real issue does.\n\nCurious question for you:  \nDo you think posting daily helped you gather enough data to spot the issue, or do you think daily posting actually masked the problem for too long?\n\nReally solid breakdown.

      "text": "I have seen many people ask Meta Ad or Google Ads, but they don’t pay attention to the fact that their medium isn’t as big of as a deal as their marketing agency. I am not personally attacking anyone but many are simply burning their money by not intervening and questioning their marketing agency enough. I have many clients whose trust has been eroded by scammy marketing agency and I tell them, why did you let this happen? Their answer is always the same. They were oblivious. So, here are a few of my tips that everyone should use if they think their marketing agency is not doing their job.  \n  \n1. The \"Platform Trap\"Google and Meta are designed to make you spend. Their \"Auto-Apply\" recommendations are often biased toward their revenue, not your ROI. A great agency acts as a filter, knowing when to lean into the machine and when to take back the wheel\n\n.2. Creative is the New Targeting-As privacy laws and \"cookie-less\" tracking have leveled the playing field, your creative is what does the heavy lifting. If your agency isn't using data-backed storytelling, they’re just guessing.\n\n3. The Shift to \"Agentic\" Execution-The best agencies have stopped doing manual, repetitive \"button-clicking.\" They are now leveraging autonomous AI tools to handle the grunt work. By integrating stacks like Blobr AI or Ryze AI, agencies can run 24/7 audits and creative swaps that a human simply can’t keep up with.\n\nNext time, ask the important questions. It pains me to see us marketing agencies get a horrible reputation just because of a few sour apples.",

Removed every \"trigger word\" and still landed in spam. This advice is from 2015 and spam filters are way smarter now. Don't waste your time obsessing over this.\n\n**9. Adding a physical address** \\- Required by law, yes. Did it help deliverability? Barely. Maybe a 1-2% improvement. Still important for compliance, but it won't save you from spam hell.\n\n**8. Using a professional email signature** \\- Added my logo, social links, the works. Looked more legit but didn't really move the needle on deliverability. Nice to have, not a game changer.\n\n**7. Reducing image-to-text ratio** \\- The old advice is \"too many images = spam.\" Cut my images way down and saw a small improvement. Maybe 5-8% better inbox placement. Helps, but it's not the main issue.\n\n**6. Consistent sending schedule** \\- This one surprised me. Sending randomly (whenever I felt like it) killed my sender reputation. Once I went to a consistent Tuesday/Thursday schedule, things improved noticeably. \n\n**5. List hygiene (removing inactive subscribers)** \\- Huge. I was scared to lose subscribers, but keeping dead emails on my list was tanking my engagement metrics. Removed anyone who hadn't opened in 6 months. Painful but necessary.\n\n**4. Double opt-in** \\- I resisted this forever because \"it reduces signups.\" Yeah, by about 30%. But the people who confirm? They're REAL. Engagement went up, complaints went down. ISPs started trusting my emails more. Worth the trade-off.\n\n**3. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records** \\- This is where it gets technical. Set up proper email authentication. Sounds boring and complicated but it's absolutely critical. Gmail and Outlook basically require this now. \n\n**2. Warming up a new domain** \\- My old domain was burned. Started fresh with a new sending domain and warmed it up properly - started with 50 emails/day, slowly increased over 6 weeks. game changer. You can't just start blasting 10k emails from a new domain.\n\n**1. Actually getting engagement (replies, opens, clicks)** \\- This is the thing nobody wants to hear. All the technical fixes mean nothing if people don't engage with your emails. ISPs watch this like hawks. I had to completely rewrite my emails to be more conversational and actually valuable. Asked questions. Encouraged replies. Made it feel like a real conversation, not a broadcast. Once engagement went up, everything else fell into place.\n\n**The biggest lesson?**\n\nThere's no magic bullet. It's a combination of technical setup + list quality + actual good content people want to read. I wasted months looking for a hack. The \"hack\" is doing the boring work correctly and writing emails people actually care about.\n\nAlso, if you're in spam now, you probably need to start fresh. Your domain reputation might be too damaged to recover. Sucks, but it's reality.\n\nAnyone else been through spam hell? What worked for you? Genuinely curious if I missed anything.",

Different content for different engagement levels keeps your overall metrics healthy.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m struggling with Instagram growth and honestly feeling a bit lost. I’ve been posting high quality content, using clean profile pictures, and interacting with other IG users, but my IG account is still growing very slowly. Because of that, I started looking into options to buy Instagram followers, but the more I read, the more confusing it becomes.\n\nThere are so many posts and ads about the best sites to buy Instagram followers, promising real, active followers, premium followers, and strong organic growth. Some say it helps increase follower count, popularity, and social proof, while others warn about fake followers, empty accounts, and damaged engagement rate. It’s hard to know what’s real.\n\nWhat I really care about is my overall Instagram presence. I don’t want to buy IG followers just to see numbers go up. I want genuine followers who don’t hurt organic engagement or confuse Instagram algorithms. I’m worried about services that offer instant delivery but later cause followers to drop, reach to fall, or engagement to disappear.\n\nI’m also curious about how these Instagram services actually work in real life. Do the followers look like real IG users or fake accounts? Does buying followers help bring more followers over time, or does it only inflate the follower count? And what about customer support is there a real customer support team, or do they disappear once you pay?\n\nI’m not trying to cheat or fake success. I just want my IG account to grow in a healthy way without ruining organic engagement. If anyone here has experience with buying Instagram followers, I’d really appreciate honest feedback, good or bad. Did it help your growth, or did it hurt your account in the long run?\n\nNot looking for promotions, just real experiences from people who’ve tried this.",

Our sales team was wasting so much time chasing ghosts that it was impacting morale. The real killer was trying to understand the connections between data points. Like okay this person is a VP of Marketing now but they used to work at a company thats a known competitor and theyve been posting about a specific technology on LinkedIn. We were manually trying to piece all of that together which was taking forever. We actually found a solution thats been a game-changer. They basically have this AI-powered platform that automatically maps all these hidden relationships in our data. It sounds like magic but it pulls data from all our different sources – Sales Navigator our CRM marketing automation platform even some internal databases – and figures out whos connected to whom and how. It scrubs the data highlights important changes like someone getting a new role and flags potential leads that actually align with our ideal customer profile. For instance we had a situation where someones title hadnt been updated in Sales Navigator but the tool picked up that they were actively involved in a project related to a technology we sell based on their LinkedIn activity and mentions in some industry publications. It was buried in the noise but the platform surfaced it. The biggest win honestly was freeing up our data team. Before they were constantly building ETL pipelines and cleaning up data but now the AI handles most of that automatically. They can finally focus on more strategic stuff. Plus its empowered our sales and marketing teams to build their own custom workflows using natural language to look for the types of leads that convert so its taken the pressure off the data team. Its made a huge difference in our lead quality and conversion rates. The company that made it has a referral program (full disclosure I'd get a kickback if you sign up through me). But honestly it solved a massive headache for us and I think it could really help you too. Happy to connect you if youre interested.",

A video for top-of-funnel brand trust should feel completely different from one meant for retargeting or sales enablement, but a lot of briefs skip that part. I’ve found it helps to map examples by funnel stage first, then brief creative off those patterns instead of vibes. Tools like Socialmon are actually useful here you can search by topic and see what kinds of videos are performing at different stages, not just what “looks good.” Once the job is clear, the creative direction usually becomes obvious.",

If there isn’t a real problem or unmet need, persuasion can create short-term attention but it doesn’t hold up long-term.\n\nThat said, I think persuasion still plays a role — not in convincing people to want something they don’t need, but in helping them recognize *why* a solution matters and how it fits their situation.\n\nIn practice, the best marketing I’ve seen feels like this:  \nproblem first, clarity second, persuasion last.\n\nWhen the problem is real and clearly understood, the persuasion part becomes much lighter and more about guidance than pressure.",

Persuasion is for snake oil.   \nOf course people have questions and concerns, but I wouldn't think of that as persuasion, It should be a open and honest approach. marketing based around solving a real problem and aiming to help real people in a clear and open exchange, is the strongest way to get seen by your audience to start build authority and trust. After authority and trust have been built through providing value driven content. \n\n*Done right there will be no need for persuasion, instead it will be your recommendation the audience values.*\n\nAgain I want to stress that of course there is room for strategy and tactics (tricks of the trade if you will) but persuasion based marketing will either give you no yield  or bite you in the arse down the road.

One thing that’s helped me reverse a slide like that was shifting some focus away from pure net new content and links, and going hard on refreshing pages that were already getting impressions. Updating structure, tightening search intent, improving internal linking, and adding missing subtopics moved a few stuck pages way faster than publishing brand new posts. I also started looking more closely at what was winning the SERP now, not what used to rank a year ago. A lot of times the format, depth, or angle had quietly changed.\n\nI also learned how to spot those opportunities better after digging into some of the strategies in odd angles media’s free Reddit SEO blueprint. It pushed me to think more in terms of demand signals and real questions people are asking, instead of just chasing keyword tools all day. That mindset shift alone helped me prioritize what was actually worth updating or expanding.\n\nIf traffic is slipping even with solid execution, I’d double down on refreshing proven pages, tightening intent match, and making sure internal links are really pushing authority where you want it. Small compounding improvements there tend to move the needle faster than constantly starting from zero.\n\nHope that helps!",

A few things to double down on:\n\n1. Lead with the answer. Put a 2-3 sentence \"Direct Summary\" at the top of every page. If an LLM agent has to dig for your point, it’ll just cite a competitor who made it easier to scrape.\n\n2. Structure your content into modular blocks. Your H2s and H3s should work as standalone \"Knowledge Passages\" that don't need the rest of the page for context.\n\n3. Don't ignore schema. It’s basically the translation layer for AI crawlers. Use it to tell the agents exactly what your entities are so they don't have to guess.\n\n4. Focus on Entity Co-occurrence. Traditional backlinks matter less than having your brand mentioned in the same breath (and training data) as your main keywords.\n\nBasically, stop trying to win the search engine and start trying to win the reasoning engine.",

The calendar view, grid preview, and analytics actually assist with thinking, not just auto-posting.\n\nIf you want lean + no-nonsense, Buffer is awesome less “creator sparkle,” more dependability.\n\nIf you have a team or brand overwhelmed with approvals, Hootsuite is fine, but it’s clunky and pricey.\n\nA true note that won’t be shouted from the rooftops: For TikTok, in particular, manual posting may still beat out schedulers in certain situations. The best combination, therefore, is often Later for planning and native posting for high-pressure content.\n\nNo magic tools just trade-offs.",

Providing a solution to a real pain point will drive many more signups than a generic announcement.\n\nI am the founder of the event marketing service MyWeb Glory. I have noticed that free courses gain the most momentum when you partner with smaller creators who can share it as a resource with their own followers. This approach turns your content into a recommended tool rather than just another ad, which is much more effective for building trust.\n\nYou should use Mydrop to schedule short clips of your best lessons across social media to keep the momentum going. If you want to turn those students into long term leads, GoHighLevel is excellent for organizing your contacts and sending automated follow ups so you can stay focused on your next production.",
