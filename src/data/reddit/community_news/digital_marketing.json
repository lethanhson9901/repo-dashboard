      "text": "Notion AI: Best for all-in-one productivity. It acts as your CRM, content calendar, and writer. The free plan is generous, and the AI add-on is roughly $10/month, which is significantly cheaper than standalone AI writers.\n\nZapier: The free tier allows for 100 \"tasks\" per month. It’s perfect for simple \"If This, Then That\" automations (e.g., If I get a new lead on Facebook, send them a welcome email).\n\nBrevo (formerly Sendinblue): Unlike Mailchimp, Brevo allows unlimited contacts on their free plan and lets you send up to 300 emails per day. It includes AI subject line generators and basic automation workflows for $0.\n\nCanva Magic Studio: The gold standard for design automation. The free version now includes \"Magic Edit\" and \"Magic Write.\" For $12.99/month, you get a full suite of AI tools that can turn a single text prompt into an entire social media campaign. Their premium templates are absolutely amazing and are worth every penny\n\nFibr.ai: Offers a highly rated Free Google Ad Copy Optimizer. It analyzes your niche and generates headlines/descriptions optimized for higher Quality Scores.\n\nRyze AI: Basically monitors your ad campaigns. Also provides meaningful advice via a chatbot. Costs like $49 per month and has other plans\n\nAdCreative.ai: For about $20–$30/mo, it generates hundreds of \"conversion-focused\" banners and creatives. It even gives them a \"confidence score\" based on how well the AI thinks they will perform on Google’s Display Network",

Digital marketing in 2026 is a mix of timeless fundamentals and adapting to new platform algorithms.\n\n* Stay audience‑first: Build content around your audience’s needs and questions rather than chasing every new trend. Google’s ranking factors now include user‑experience signals like page speed and performance ([10 Important SEO Metrics to Track in 2026](https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/metrics#:~:text=10%20Important%20SEO%20Metrics%20to,Core%20Web%20Vitals)), so make sure your site loads quickly and provides a great experience on mobile.\n* Prioritise retention and watch‑time on social: Algorithms reward content that keeps people watching. For example, Instagram’s retention charts show how long reels are watched and when viewers drop off ([Instagram Reel Analytics: Retention & Skip Rate Explained](https://metricool.com/instagram-reel-analytics/#:~:text=Instagram%20Reel%20Analytics%3A%20Retention%20%26,are%20Retention%20and%20Skip%20Rates)). Hooks that grab attention within the first few seconds and keep watch‑time high tend to perform best ([Instagram Creator Monetization Checklist 2026 - InfluenceFlow](https://influenceflow.io/resources/instagram-creator-monetization-checklist-your-complete-2026-guide/#:~:text=Instagram%20Creator%20Monetization%20Checklist%202026,Focus%20on%20Reels%20Performance)).\n* Use data to iterate: Instead of guessing, look at analytics (GA4, retention graphs, engagement dashboards) to see what resonates. Even small improvements in metrics like click‑through rate or watch‑time compound over time.\n* Diversify channels: Pair your social content with owned channels like email newsletters, podcasts or communities. This builds first‑party relationships and insulates you from algorithm changes.\n* Collaborate thoughtfully: Micro‑influencer partnerships and affiliate programs can work well when they’re aligned with your niche and focused on engagement rather than vanity metrics ([Instagram Monetization in 2026: What Actually Works (and …](https://www.reddit.com/r/InstagramMarketing/comments/1qjeekr/instagram_monetization_in_2026_what_actually/#:~:text=Instagram%20Monetization%20in%202026%3A%20What,and%20What%20Doesn%E2%80%99t)).\n\nHope that helps!

The marketers I see struggling are the ones who were basically doing what AI does - cranking out generic blog posts, writing cookie-cutter ad copy, building templated strategies. Yeah, AI can do that now.\n\n\n\nBut the ones who actually understand their client's business, who can read between the lines of data and say \"here's why this campaign flopped even though the numbers look fine on paper\" - AI isn't touching that.\n\n\n\nWhat I've noticed is that AI is actually making good marketers even better. I use it to handle the grunt work (first drafts, data organization, brainstorming) which frees me up to spend more time on strategy and client relationships. That's where the real value is.\n\n\n\nThe human touch thing you mentioned is spot on. Every client has a different voice, different audience, different goals. AI can approximate that but it can't truly understand the nuances. I had a client in a very niche B2B space and every AI-generated piece sounded like it was written for a generic SaaS company. The industry-specific knowledge and tone just wasn't there.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, AI is a tool upgrade not a replacement.

      "text": "For years, the rule was simple: rank higher, get more traffic, win. But AI Overviews are changing what winning looks like. Users can get a product recommendation, a short comparison, even pros and cons without clicking anything.\n\n*So, if your brand is present inside AI answers, is traffic still the main KPI, or is it becoming a vanity metric?*\n\nWe ran a study to understand how much influence review platforms still have in AI Overviews, especially for commercial queries where people are choosing software or services. The results look like a paradox:\n\nReview platforms show up in roughly every third AI Overview. Specifically, 34.5% of AI Overviews cited at least one review platform. \n\nThat means most AI answers still come from somewhere else. And yet, when review platforms do appear, Google often includes more than one in the same answer. In AI Overviews that include review sites, we saw an average of 2.28 review-platform links per response. It’s like the system prefers to present a comparison view instead of one single source.\n\n*Even more interesting:* the words people use in the query change everything. If the query clearly asks for reviews or ratings, review platforms appear far more often. If the query is more like best or top, review platforms show up much less. \n\nThat’s counterintuitive for anyone who assumed best tools queries would naturally lean on G2/Capterra-style sources.\n\nEven the platforms that dominate AI citations still lost most of their organic traffic between early 2024 and the end of 2025. The declines in our dataset ranged from 76.5% to 92.2%. In plain terms, being heavily cited by AI did not protect them from losing clicks:\n\n* Review platforms appear in 34.5% of AI Overviews\n* Query wording impact: review/rating queries 49%, software/tools queries 39.4%, best/top queries 17.1%\n* The top five platforms account for 88% of all review-platform links in AI Overviews (Gartner Peer Insights, G2, Capterra, Software Advice, TrustRadius)\n* Organic traffic declines for the most cited platforms ranged from 76.5% to 92.2% from early 2024 to end of 2025\n* When review platforms appear, AI Overviews often include multiple: 2.28 review links per response on average\n\nSo what are we supposed to optimize for now?\n\nIf AI can borrow your credibility and your structure to answer the query directly, traffic may drop even while influence stays high. That shifts the game from visits to visibility inside the answer layer.\n\nWe’d love your take: Is traffic still the goal, or is the new goal to be included and trusted inside AI answers, even if the click never happens? And if you agree, what metrics are you using to prove value to stakeholders?",

High intent searches convert immediately.\n\nContent business or SaaS? SEO if you can wait 6 to 12 months. Organic traffic scales without ongoing ad spend.\n\nConsumer product with visual appeal? Paid Meta or TikTok. Best creative testing and conversion tracking for e-commerce.\n\nOur clients see best ROI doubling down on channels where they already have traction. Amplify what's proven, not trendy.\n\nThe mistake is picking based on what sounds exciting versus what your business needs. New business with no audience? Paid ads for fast feedback. Established with traffic but low conversions? Email and retention.\n\nIf forced to pick universally, email wins for most businesses with existing customers. Highest ROI, full control, works across industries. But only if you have a list.\n\nFor acquisition with zero assets, paid search or Meta ads get you learning fastest. Organic takes too long when you need validation.\n\nReal world success depends on execution quality more than channel choice. Great email beats mediocre SEO. Channel matters less than how well you execute.\n\nFocus on channel where your customers are and where you can create better content or targeting than competitors.\n\nHonest answer is test multiple channels at low budget, find what converts profitably, go all in on that. Picking blindly is guessing.\n\nThis year specifically, organic social harder, paid ads more expensive, SEO takes longer. Email and owned audiences are safest bets for ROI if you have them.",

Not blasting connection requests, but targeted outreach where the message is obviously relevant to their role or current situation. Quiet readers are still there, they just don’t engage publicly.\n\nTwitter is tougher unless you already have history, but it can work if you treat it less like outreach and more like reputation building. People notice patterns over time, not single DMs. Cold Twitter DMs without context usually go nowhere.\n\nReddit is different. It’s not an outreach channel in the traditional sense. It’s more like a long game of being useful in the right rooms. When you consistently add value to conversations your ICP already cares about, DMs tend to come to you. The moment it feels transactional, it backfires.\n\nThe mistake I see most is trying to force the same behavior everywhere. Each platform has its own social contract. If you respect that, outreach feels like relevance instead of noise.\n\nThere’s a bit more nuance in how to decide where to invest first depending on your ICP and offer, but that’s the general framework I use.

At the enterprise level SOC 2 isn't really a nice to have, it's table stakes for anything touching customer data or significant ad spend. The performance potential doesn't matter if a data incident tanks your brand reputation or triggers a compliance nightmare that costs 10x what you saved on CPMs.\n\nThat said there's a middle ground. We've had clients test newer platforms with limited budgets using anonymized or aggregated data only, no PII, no pixel data, nothing that creates real exposure. Run it as a proof of concept with strict guardrails so you can validate the performance claims before pushing legal to do a full vendor review. If the results are legit, that gives you actual data to justify the compliance investment on their end or yours.\n\nThe reality is most of these newer CTV platforms will get SOC 2 eventually if they want enterprise money. Some of them are actively in the audit process and just haven't completed it yet which is very different from a platform that has no plans to pursue it. Worth asking them directly where they are in that process because \"we're mid audit expected Q3\" is a completely different conversation than \"we haven't started.\"\n\nOne thing I'd push back on though is the framing of compliance vs performance as a tradeoff. The platforms that skip compliance to move fast are also usually the ones with inflated performance metrics, sketchy inventory sourcing, or attribution that falls apart under scrutiny. Not always but often enough that the correlation is worth paying attention to. Our clients who've chased shiny new platforms without proper vetting have gotten burned more often than not, sometimes with ad fraud issues they didn't catch for months because the reporting looked great on the surface.\n\nIf the targeting and pricing really are that good, give them 6 months to get compliant and revisit. Plenty of proven channels to optimize in the meantime.",

          "text": "Not a dumb question at all, most ecom brands completely ignore post purchase and leave stupid amounts of money on the table. It's one of the highest leverage things you can do because the hardest and most expensive part, getting someone to trust you enough to buy, is already done.\n\nThe math is pretty simple. Acquiring a new customer costs whatever your CAC is. Getting an existing buyer to purchase again costs almost nothing by comparison. Even small improvements in post purchase conversion rates have an outsized impact on overall profitability because there's virtually no additional acquisition cost eating into the margin.\n\nWhat actually works in practice from what we've seen with our clients. Post purchase upsell offers immediately after checkout convert anywhere from 5 to 15% depending on the offer relevance and discount. That's essentially free revenue on transactions that already happened. Retention email flows triggered by purchase behavior, not just generic \"thanks for buying\" sequences but actually intelligent flows based on what they bought, when they're likely to need a refill or complementary product, and their browsing behavior after purchase. Those consistently outperform broadcast campaigns by a wide margin.\n\nThe tools in this space have gotten way better. Cleverific is fine for Shopify focused post purchase offers but honestly the real gains come from building out the full retention system, not just slapping an upsell widget on the thank you page. The widget alone is a nice bump but it's like 20% of the actual opportunity.\n\nWhere most people screw this up is treating PRO as a one time setup and forgetting about it. The brands crushing it are testing different post purchase offers constantly, segmenting by first time vs repeat buyers, adjusting timing on follow up flows based on actual repurchase data, and tracking contribution margin on repeat purchases separately from new customer acquisition.\n\nThe biggest thing nobody talks about is that strong post purchase optimization actually makes your paid acquisition more aggressive because your LTV goes up. If you know a customer is worth $150 over 6 months instead of just their first $50 order, you can afford a higher CAC and outbid competitors who are only optimizing for first purchase ROAS. That's the real compounding effect.",

Cut our duplicate rate from 40% to under 5% in six months. The other thing that helped was setting field-level permissions so reps couldn't customize the schema on their own.
