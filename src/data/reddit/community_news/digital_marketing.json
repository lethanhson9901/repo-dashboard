      "text": "I'm hoping to get some advice from you guys because I'm completely lost on how this whole thing works. I've been posting a lot lately, but my followers are growing super slow. It feels like whenever real people visit my page, they see my tiny follower count and just leave without even looking at my posts. I'm starting to think that if I just had a bigger number, my profile would look more popular and people would actually want to stay and follow me. That is why I'm looking for a way to get free Instagram followers just to get things moving.   \n  \nI don't really know how any of this stuff operates behind the scenes. I just want a simple site where I can get some free followers to make my account look bigger and more established. I don't want to mess anything up or get my page banned because I don't fully understand it that well. Has anyone here actually figured out what site gives free Instagram followers without getting your account in trouble? Did having that bigger number actually help you attract real people afterwards? I'm just looking for a safe website that works because I don't want to pay for expensive marketing packages. Please let me know if you guys have any suggestions on what to do or where to go",

Tested four platforms and here's my raw experience with them:\n\n**profound** ($500-600/mo):\n\n* beautiful dashboards, genuinely impressive demos\n* the data accuracy is questionable. ran the same queries manually and got different results\n* attribution model feels like it's built to make their numbers look good, not give you real data\n* support was responsive, but when I pushed on methodology they started ghosting me \n\nverdict: expensive way to feel like you're doing something\n\n**hubspot**:\n\n* feels like it was not part of the plan. like someone said -we need an ai feature two weeks before launch\n* if you're already in hubspot ecosystem it's free, but the insights are surface-level\n* can't tell you which ai engines are citing you or why \n\nverdict: checkbox feature, not a real solution\n\n**otterly** ($100-150/mo):\n\n* decent monitoring and alerts\n* good for 'are we showing up' but not for 'why and what to do about it.'\n* limited on the strategy plus optimization side \n\nverdict: fine for monitoring, not enough for optimizatin\n\n**Limy**:\n\n* only one that actually showed me which prompts are generating traffic and tied it to revenue\n* attribution model is transparent - you can see the methodology\n* not perfect - ui could use work, some features feel early\n* but the core data is accurate and actionable\n\nverdict: best for practitioners who actually need to attribute ai traffic to pipeline\n\nHave you tested any of these vendors or any other, and what was your experience?",

Like you might be visible in ChatGPT but completely absent from Gemini or Claude, and the reasons why are totally different per model.\n\nAlso the \"attribution\" piece is tricky because AI referral traffic shows up differently in analytics depending on whether the user clicked a citation link vs just typed your brand name after seeing it in an AI answer. The second one is basically dark traffic and most tools cant capture it.\n\nWe've been building something at vectorgap that tracks share of voice across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and Perplexity simultaneously -- the cross-model view is what makes it useful imo because optimizing for one model can actually hurt you on another. Like Perplexity heavily weights source recency while Claude seems to care more about structured factual content.\n\nDid you test any of those four tools on multi-model tracking?

I even hired a web developer and designer to design an attractive website connected to a landing page, asked my customers to leave a good review (in exchange of 5% discount) but now i’m really confused.

Did your cost per click increase significantly?\n2. Is traffic quality similar, or are you reaching broader audiences?\n3. Are you seeing more window shoppers during peak season?\n4. Did average order value change?\n\nAlso, during gift-heavy seasons, timing matters a lot. Early planners behave differently from last-minute buyers.\n\nInstead of “I’ve done it all,” I’d isolate where the drop happened:\n\n– Traffic problem?  \n– Conversion problem?  \n– Cost problem?  \n– Offer problem?\n\nAgencies can help, but clarity on where the leak is will save you money before paying anyone else.",

When supply increases along with demand, costs go up. In August, there may be less competition, which could be one possible reason for better performance during that period.\n\nLess attractive Ad copy and creative as compare to competitors could also be a reason. Think of it this way: if people are seeing better ads compared to yours and have more attractive options in the market, they may still see your ads but not click on them. This results in a lower CTR, which increases costs and ultimately decreases ROAS.\n\nThese are the possible reasons based on my understanding, without knowing more details about your ads and business.\n\n5% off and conversion rate 20% down - For these occassion people not think about money more they think best of best product for their loved ones and if other people have better products and better way of messaging and ads they will get more.",

It's a sign that you were competing against every other gift shop in your market during the most expensive ad auction of the year for your category. CPMs during Valentine's week can easily 2-3x compared to off season. So the same ad that printed money in August will look mediocre when the auction is flooded.\n\nThe thing I'd actually look at is your repeat customer rate. A gift shop lives and dies by returning buyers. If someone bought from you last Valentine's, did you email them in January? Did you text them a week before with a \"your order from last year\" reminder? That's basically free revenue you're leaving on the table.\n\nAlso worth checking your Google Ads search terms report. During peak seasons you attract way more junk traffic from broad match queries. I'd bet you're paying for clicks from people searching for free printable cards or DIY gift ideas who were never going to buy anything.",

It’s not always about the site or creative either, sometimes, bidding just gets too aggressive and your usual strategies stop working. Before you spend money on an agency, you might want to take a deep dive into your targeting and timing. Try narrowing your audience, tweaking your ad copy to speak directly to last-minute gifters, and maybe adjusting your budget to off-peak hours. Also, compare your August campaign settings with what you ran this time. Even small changes in geo, device, or placements can make a big difference. \n\nDon’t ignore platforms like Pinterest or even local groups on Facebook, as people shop for gifts there too. Setting up automated rules to pause underperforming ads can help stretch your budget. There are AI-powered tools like 4XDigital AI that can automate creative testing and optimize your campaigns across multiple channels, which is helpful if you’re strapped for time. But honestly, sometimes it just comes down to timing and market saturation. Keep testing, and don’t feel pressured to throw money at an agency unless you really hit a wall.",

Helps with brainstorms, reports and what not\n* **Google Nano Banana:** Helps us replace items/things in the image without changing anything else. Great for consistent characters and subjects across multiple images! Can also \n* **Canva**: Yes, it gets clowned on sometimes, but honestly Canva is the best tool for non-designers who need fast creative. My team whips up ads, sales decks, and social content way faster here than waiting on design queues. \n* **Loom**: Can’t tell you how helpful it is for async communication and documentation to just record my screen while I’m taking and send it to someone. Hidden gem: AI transcription is a nice feature. These also work for recording product demos. \n* **Frizerlly**: Their AI agent can learn all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog on our website every day! We usually let is publish as a draft and manually switch it to published after a quick review! \n* **Hotjar**: If you’re not tracking how users move on your site, you’re flying blind. Heatmaps and recordings help me figure out why people bounce or where they get stuck. \n* **Zapier**: I’ve got zaps running for everything from lead routing to Slack alerts for new demo requests. The stuff it automates behind the scenes saves me from mind-numbing tasks. \n\nAnd that's about it! I know its not one but hope it helps someone :)",

All the online marketing “coaches”, all of the 1M MRR from 5 clients and etc.\n\nI was sitting on Reddit the other day and read a post about an e-com influencer being caught faking his sales and having an open collaboration with the platform that lets you fake the results. A peanut for a brain basically.\n\nBut I decided to do some research myself since I had too much free time that day, I investigated all of the brez scale of the industry, basically the biggest influencers and all of the go-to coaches for digital marketing.\n\nGuess what.\n\nI noticed the same thing, one of the best known “coaches” within the space who constantly flexes his “Yellow Ferrari” (which by now I think is rented) forgot to remove a “,” when faking his stripe numbers. You can connect the dots yourself on who it is.\n\nI thought to myself this couldn’t be real, I sent the video to multiple friends, they all saw the same thing.\n\nMessaged the guy, asked to join his course, the usual. Then once the call link got sent, I sent him the screenshot.\n\nHis reply was the same, he said the dashboard wasn’t real but it helped him push out more content. He sent me the platform and a discount code for it as an affiliate partnership reference. The platform is extremely polished and you genuinely couldn’t tell the original from the fake apart if you didn’t make any typo’s. (Yes, I bought the dashboard for research purposes ONLY)\n\nI thought to myself “No shit, they’re all faking it”.\n\nThe internet, especially the digital marketing coaching scene, is full of fakes. There’s even tools helping them do it to lure you into the “get rich quick online” scene.\n\nI’m not saying every coach is fake, but please for the love of God, do your own due-diligence prior to falling to the guy with the rented lambo and the rented penthouse.\n\nEDIT: I can see some of you are DM'ing me for the tools name. I do not condone this type of business, never have, and wouldn't support anything or anyone partaking in it. Those claiming \" for research\" purposes, it's dashmock or something like it. Again, I don't encourage anyone using it but it does amaze me how someone decides to build it out this well. I'm not affiliated with them in any shape or form.",

The fundamental business model for a lot of these \"coaches\" is selling the dream of what they claim to have achieved, not actually teaching a repeatable skill.\n\n\n\nThe biggest red flag I've learned to watch for: if someone's primary revenue stream is teaching you how to make money doing X rather than actually doing X themselves, that tells you everything. The real practitioners are usually too busy running their businesses to create flashy course funnels.\n\n\n\nA few practical due diligence tips for anyone evaluating coaches or courses:\n\n\n\n\\- Check their LinkedIn and business history. Real operators have years of consistent work, not a sudden pivot to \"coaching\" after 6 months.\n\n\\- Ask for verifiable client references, not just screenshots. Anyone can fake a dashboard but real clients will vouch for real results.\n\n\\- Look at their actual online presence as a marketer. If they claim to be a digital marketing expert but their own content strategy is just flexing lifestyle, something doesn't add up.\n\n\\- Be skeptical of urgency tactics. \"Only 3 spots left\" and countdown timers are selling tools, not value indicators.\n\n\n\nThe frustrating part is that there are genuinely good educators out there who get drowned out by the noise. The best ones I've found tend to share real value freely (through blogs, YouTube, forums like this) and their paid content goes deeper rather than gating basic knowledge behind a paywall.\n\n\n\nGood on you for investigating though.

Some brands dominate commercial intent queries but disappear on informational ones, and vice versa.\n\nRe your question about source weighting -- from what we see, GPT still heavily favors sources with strong topical authority and recent citations.

I do work for about 10 of them…and counting. \n\nI find my passion is now more on brand strategy but that has taken 10 years of various marketing/event planning roles to get me here. \n\nSo my advice would be to focus on learning your skill through your jobs, let them pay for you to learn. It may take some time but it has worked for me!",

If you’re mainly focused on skills right now, that’s a great place to be, but if you’re craving that higher ceiling later on, I’d seriously consider building something of your own instead of staying in agency roles forever.\n\nThat said, it’s not for everyone, and there’s nothing wrong with choosing a different path.",

If ChatGPT mentions your brand and the person just googles you or types your URL directly, thats dark traffic. You'd see a bump in direct/branded search but have no idea it came from an AI answer. GA4 only catches the clicks on citation links which is probably 20-30% of actual AI-influenced visits.\n\nFor tracking the actual visibility side (not just the traffic), we've been running the same prompts across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and Perplexity weekly to track who gets recommended.

YouTube + implementation\nNot “binge watch.”\nSearch specific problems:\n\n“How to run Facebook ads for local businesses”\n“How to cold email for SMMA”\n“How to structure a landing page”\nThen actually do it. Break stuff. Fix it. Repeat.\n\n2. Get results for yourself first\nRun a theme page.\nStart a small affiliate site.\nGrow a local service IG.\nYou’ll learn more managing $50 of your own ad spend than from 20 hours of course videos.\n\n3. Offer free/cheap work to get reps\nDM local businesses.\n“Hey, I’ll run your ads for free, you just cover ad spend.”\nNow you’re learning on real money, real stakes.\n\n4. Reverse engineer people already winning\nStudy their:\n\nHooks\nOffers\nLanding pages\nEmail flows\nYou can literally sign up to their funnels and see how it works.\n\n5. Free platforms > paid gurus\nTwitter/X threads\nReddit case studies\nIndie Hackers\nMeta + Google official documentation\nShopify blog\nHubSpot blog\n\nThe actual info isn’t secret. The execution is.\n\nWhat courses really sell is:\n\nStructure\nAccountability\nCommunity\nNot magic knowledge.\nIf someone can’t show live proof (screen share, Stripe dashboard, ad accounts in real time), assume it’s marketing.\n\nThe people quietly making $5k–$20k/month usually aren’t selling courses. They’re too busy fulfilling.\n\nIf you’re trying to get into DM, what lane? Ads, content, email, SEO, affiliate, local lead gen? That part matters way more than buying a course.",

I started with just two things: the 'Senator We Run Ads' YouTube channel, one of the best places to learn and define your path in digital marketing, and Coursera (I took Google's 6-month Digital Marketing & E-commerce program).\nOnce I finished that program (which covers the basics and fundamentals), I moved on to the Google Ads and GA4 certifications. There are a ton of certs out there, but I recommend focusing on the main ones: Search, Display, Shopping, Measurement, and GA4.\nHowever, even after finishing the program and the certs, I only had a vague idea of the theory. I hadn't put any of it into practice aside from some small organic/social experiments. To really learn the complex stuff like CRM, marketing automation, and how to actually run Google/Meta Ads I took a 6-month internship at a digital agency. It was basically unpaid.\nDid I starve? Yes. But I learned a ton. It connected all the missing dots: I saw how digital channels work for real businesses, how to pull marketing levers, build campaigns, analyze data, create reports, and make data-driven decisions. From that point on, everything got much easier and the agency offered me a permanent contract.\nIn my experience, you need to be more of a generalist than a specialist to survive the AI era. You might start as a specialist in your role, but you need to understand how the entire ecosystem works. If you cover all the basics like SEO, Paid Ads, CRM/Email, Social, Analytics, and Attribution you’ll be able to pivot into almost any role in the future.\nHope that my experience helps. If you need more information send me a DM.",

Stattdessen nur recherchiert , angesehen , hingehört und wieder recherchiert ! Nach 2 jahren war ich dann endlich an dem Punkt hinter all das zu steigen.\nWas da so passiert ….Ich kann dir nur sagen es ist eine absolute voll Katastrophe! \nDie allermeisten dort haben keine Ahnung von Marketing oder was überhaupt dahinter steckt ! Lass die Finger von diesen gängigen Vermarktungskursen und Speicher dir nicht ab das sei digitales Marketing! Wenn überhaupt ist das Content creation aber auch das ist nicht wirklich erklärend für das was da passiert! Digitales Marketing ist definitiv erfolgsorientiert ! Absolut !Ich selber arbeite mittlerweile in dem Bereich und verdiene damit mein Geld . Es war ein echt harter Weg bis dahin und auch heute bin ich noch lange nicht da wo ich sein will. Dennoch war es die beste Entscheidung meines Lebens und hat mich enorm zum positiven verändert 😊 was ich dir sagen kann ist das es definitiv nicht einfach ist aber auch nur dann bist du auf dem richtigen Weg. Wir fallen um wieder aufzustehen. Und das wirst du definitiv. Du wirst aber auch größer und stärker damit werden ! Viel Erfolg 🍀 bleib immer am Ball ! Recherchier was das Zeug hält ! 🍀✨",

If your organic content doesn't get any traction at all, throwing money behind it won't magically fix the message.

That model is basically gone on most platforms.\n\n\n\nThe new model is: post content > algorithm tests it with a small group of NON-followers > if they engage, it pushes wider. This is why organic can still work incredibly well, but only if your content is built for discovery, not just for your existing audience.\n\n\n\nWhat this means practically:\n\n\n\n\\- Your content needs to hook strangers in 1-2 seconds, not just resonate with people who already know you\n\n\\- Saves and shares matter more than likes now - they signal to the algorithm that your content has long-term value\n\n\\- Reels/short video still gets the most organic distribution on IG and Facebook. Static posts are shown primarily to existing followers\n\n\\- LinkedIn is genuinely the best platform for organic reach right now if you're B2B. The algorithm there still favors engagement over ad spend\n\n\n\nPaid and organic shouldn't compete - they should complement each other. Use organic to test what content resonates, then amplify the winners with paid. If you're putting ad budget behind content that doesn't work organically, you're just paying to show people content they don't care about.\n\n\n\nThe people saying organic is dead are usually the ones still posting like it's 2020 - static images, generic captions, broad hashtags.

With features like Magic Design, Magic Write, and AI image/video generation, Canva can now turn a simple prompt into ready-to-publish marketing assets in minutes. It even supports bulk campaign creation and one-click resizing across platforms, which dramatically speeds up content production.\n\nAlongside this, tools like Runable are emerging to streamline the execution layer of marketing helping teams automate workflows, operational tasks, and campaign rollouts without heavy engineering effort. Together, creative AI (like Canva) and execution automation (like Runable) are reducing the gap between idea and launch, giving small teams leverage that previously required entire marketing departments.",

AI resets on every prompt.\n\nwhen we built our brand consistency system for production clients, the biggest unlock wasn't better prompting — it was treating brand representation as a data problem. static style guide PDFs don't actually constrain AI well. what works is capturing what 'on-brand' looks like in structured form — your 10-15 best-performing pieces per channel as dynamic anchors — then running a drift check before each publish.\n\nthe tools that'll actually solve this aren't the ones with better models. they're the ones that can learn your brand continuously.",

Instead of hunting for the perfect AI, build a simple system: define what your brand voice actually sounds like in writing, create a short style guide (tone, common phrases, what you'd never say), then use that as your quality filter for any tool output.\n\n\n\nFor service businesses especially, I'd start with the highest-touch communication first. Incoming calls and appointment booking matter more than social captions. That's where a voice receptionist trained on your actual business info, hours, and how you handle customer questions pays off immediately. You skip the robotic experience entirely and capture leads that would otherwise walk. Then use content tools for lower-stakes stuff where editing feels less painful.",

I also keep a small swipe file of posts that perform well and literally prompt the model with “write in this style, but about X.”\nWhatever stack you use, having a short “brand voice guardrail” doc (phrases you use, phrases you avoid, POV on the topic) and past high-performing examples in the prompt makes a bigger difference than which AI tool you pick.",

If it's seen it before, it doesn't really have any need to surface your information. \n\nWhen you have AI do the work, it can only talk about what it knows, so it's never really going to be able to generate anything useful for itself. I suppose Gemini might produce something that OpenAI could learn from or vice versa, but that doesn't really help us because we want to be useful everywhere. \n\nSo... you have to get all the stuff that connects the info back up the funnel to your brand at the top - and that's the \"new\" connection (or at least the foundation of it) that you're presenting in your content. If the AI was already capable of producing this content with all those connections intact, you don't need to produce the new content because it already knows. \n\nYou're going to need to be involved in content creation forever.

If yes, you're adding value. If the whole thing falls apart without the pitch, it's promotion dressed up as advice.\n\n\n\nWhat works for me is leading with specifics. Instead of \"I built a tool that does X,\" I try to explain the thinking or process behind it. People respect transparency about what you've learned way more than what you've built. And if someone is genuinely curious they'll check your profile anyway.\n\n\n\nThe tricky part is that communities have different thresholds. Some are super strict, others are basically open marketplaces. Reading the room matters more than any fixed ratio.",

I know none of that is groundbreaking on its own, but one of our clients at Maestra hit 52.5% total revenue growth by systematically plugging leaks. We upgraded their Meta ads to dynamic product cards + A/B tested their lead capture (went from 0.37% to 6.1% subscriber rate) + added personalized recommendations to the homepage, product pages, cart, empty search, and 404 + branched their abandoned cart flows by product category + built a post-purchase flow. No fancy AI strategy, no revolutionary playbook - just fixed boring stuff across the whole journey and let it compound. That's the strategy that works in 2026, 2027, and probably 2030 too",

Strong positioning, owned audiences (email, communities), real brand authority, and content that actually shows expertise or personality.

For example, AI can create beautiful photos or videos of food, but it cannot change the real quality of the food or the service a restaurant provides.\nIn my opinion, reviews and word of mouth from trusted people will become the most reliable form of marketing.

Mass targeting will become less effective, while strategies built around first party data, email, and community building will grow stronger. Short form, authentic content will outperform overly polished campaigns. Brands will also focus more on retention and customer lifetime value instead of just acquiring new leads. In short, marketing will move away from broad reach and quick wins toward deeper engagement, trust, and long term relationships.",

The strategies becoming less effective are spray-and-pray paid ads with weak creative, SEO built on thin AI content at scale, heavy third-party cookie retargeting, and generic cold outreach that lacks personalization. As algorithms get smarter and privacy tightens, these approaches simply produce diminishing returns.\n\nGoing forward, marketers should double down on **first-party data, strong positioning, high-quality creative, and owned distribution** (email lists, communities, creator partnerships). The winners will be those who deeply understand customer intent, run fast experiments, and tie marketing directly to revenue outcomes. AI will amplify execution speed, but strategy and differentiation will matter more than ever.\n\nTools can help operationalize this shift. For example, **Runable** is powerful for building automated growth workflows (monitoring intent signals, triggering personalized outreach, and orchestrating experiments), while platforms like **Canva AI** accelerate creative production and **ChatGPT** helps scale research and messaging. Used well, these tools don’t replace marketers they free you to focus on insight, positioning, and compounding channels that actually build durable growth.",

          "text": "A few things I think will shift significantly:\n\n\n\nSEO as we know it is going to look very different. With AI overviews eating into click-through rates from search, the traditional \"rank and bank\" approach to content is losing steam. The brands that will win are the ones creating content that AI models want to cite as sources - which means genuinely authoritative, well-structured, factual content. Thin SEO articles stuffed with keywords are already becoming worthless.\n\n\n\nEmail marketing is going to become more important, not less. As third-party data gets restricted and algorithm-dependent platforms become less reliable, owning your audience directly through email (and SMS) becomes the most defensible channel. The people who built real lists will be better positioned than those who relied entirely on social reach.\n\n\n\nPure paid media management as a standalone service will get squeezed. Google and Meta are automating more of the campaign optimization. The value will shift from \"I can manage your bids\" to \"I can create the strategy, messaging, and creative that feeds these automated systems properly.\"\n\n\n\nCommunity-led growth will matter more. People trust recommendations from peers in communities (Reddit, Discord, niche forums) more than ads. Brands that genuinely participate rather than just advertise will have an edge.\n\n\n\nWhat won't change: the fundamentals. Understanding your customer, having a clear value proposition, and being able to communicate it simply. The channels shift but the underlying principles stay the same. Marketers who obsess over tactics without understanding strategy will always be playing catch-up.",

We’ve been producing short films and, الحمدلله, we’ve been fortunate enough to win some international awards.\n\nOur main problem right now is marketing and audience growth.\n\nWe do all our marketing ourselves because we don’t have the budget to hire social media managers or content creators. Our team is very small, and our main focus is writing, shooting, and editing films. On top of that, we’re also handling everything else like graphic design, editing social media videos, posters, and managing accounts.\n\nThe issue is that despite putting a lot of effort into our content, our views and followers are still very low.\n\nFE, I created a short AI video imagining our film’s main character as if he was a character in Fortnite. It was just for fun and didn’t represent the real film or our usual style.\n\nBut surprisingly, that video got significantly more views than our actual film content and official posts.\n\nThis made us question a lot of things:\n\nAre we approaching content the wrong way?\n\nDo audiences connect more with entertaining / trend-based content than with actual film content?\n\nAre we being too serious with our marketing?\n\nWe’d really appreciate honest feedback and advice:\n\n* What do you think could be the problem?\n* How important is posting frequency vs content quality?\n* Should filmmakers focus on “secondary content” even if it’s not their main passion?\n* How do you balance filmmaking and content creation without burning out?\n\nAnother important point: we are Arab filmmakers.\n\n* How can we reach non-Arabic speaking audiences?\n* Is it necessary to create a separate English account, or is bilingual content enough?\n\nAlso, we’re considering creating an AI UGC avatar to act as the “public face” of our brand and represent our production team online.\n\n* Do you recommend this?\n* If yes, what style, age, and personality would work best for a film production brand targeting young audiences?\n\nFinally, the most important question:\n\nHow can we create strong, effective content without extreme pressure and burnout?\n\nIf anyone is willing to review our account and give honest criticism, we’d be very grateful.\n\nThank you so much.\n\ninstagram: \"@montage\\_mpictures\"  \ntiktok: \"@montage\\_pictures\"",

Film content and social content are different games. Social platforms reward personality, process, and native content, not just polished final work. The Fortnite-style clip likely worked because it felt platform-native. A few quick thoughts: Do not use social only as a trailer feed. Show behind the scenes, writing process, challenges, and character stories. Secondary content is not a distraction. It is how people discover you. For non-Arab audiences, strong subtitles and occasional bilingual captions are usually enough. A separate account can split growth early on. I would avoid an AI avatar. For filmmakers, real faces and authentic stories usually connect more. Keep it simple to avoid burnout. ",

Clear topical depth (not just one good page).\n\nIf you have one strong article and competitors have a cluster (guide + comparisons + FAQs + supporting posts), \nGoogle trusts them more as a source.\n\nTopical authority isn’t a buzzword — it’s basically:\n\n“Do you cover this subject completely or just partially?”\n\n2. Clean structure + direct answers.\n\nAI summaries pull concise, structured answers.\nPages that:\n•\tAnswer the query early\n•\tUse clear subheadings\n•\tHave short, factual paragraphs\n… tend to get referenced more.\n\nFAQ sections help — not because of schema magic, but because they force clarity.\n\n3. Entity clarity > raw backlinks (in many cases).\n\nBacklinks still matter. \nBut I’ve seen lower DR sites get featured because their content is tighter and more aligned to the query intent.\nIf your brand/entity isn’t clearly associated with the topic, AI Overviews may skip you even if you rank.\n\nOn ranking fluctuations\n\nStability lately comes from:\n\n•\tUpdating content more frequently\n•\tPruning overlapping pages (keyword cannibalization is brutal now)\n•\tStrengthening internal linking within topic clusters\n•\tTightening search intent alignment\n\nIf rankings swing hard, check:\n\n•\tAre you mixing informational + commercial intent?\n•\tAre competitors refreshing content more often?\n•\tAre you over-optimizing for keywords instead of answering the actual question?",

Google is constantly tweaking which queries trigger them and which sources get cited. I've watched the same page appear in AIO for a query, disappear for two weeks, then come back.\n\nSo don't chase stability in a system that isn't stable yet. Focus on what you can control.\n\nThe biggest lever I've found is making sure the first 2-3 sentences of your content directly answer the query in plain language. AI Overviews love pulling clean, definitive statements. If your intro is fluffy or takes 200 words to get to the point, you're getting skipped.\n\nAlso, something practical: go check what your competitors' AIO citations actually look like. Open an incognito window, search the query, and read what Google is pulling. You'll usually notice the cited content is structured differently than typical SEO content. Shorter paragraphs, more factual, less keyword-stuffed.",

AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude actually decide what to show people and honestly it's so different from how Google works .( This is a basic explanation, will be diving into it more in my newsletter )\n\nbasically these AI tools don't just rank websites like Google does. They pull information from sources that are authoritative, detailed and actually useful for answering the specific question someone asked. Which means the whole traditional SEO game kind of shifts here.\n\nWhat actually matters for getting your product or business noticed by AI:\n\nYour product pages need to be really thorough. Like specs, pricing, reviews, availability, what makes you different. The more complete it is the better chance the AI picks it up when someone asks a relevant question.\n\nStructure your content properly. Headers, lists, tables, schema markup. AI models parse structured content way more easily than big walls of text.\n\nWrite content that actually answers questions people are asking. Detailed guides, comparisons, conversational explanations. Think about what someone would literally type into ChatGPT and make sure your content answers that.\n\nGet mentioned on credible sites. Backlinks and reviews from trusted sources signal that you're legit.( This one is pretty imp)\n\neverything should be updated. Stale outdated info gets ignored completely.\n\nAnd this thing is called GEO, Generative Engine Optimization, which is basically optimizing so that AI tools like ChatGPT and Google actually recommend and mention your brand when someone asks a relevant question. It's like SEO but for AI search instead of traditional Google rankings.\n\nwill be writing about this in detail in my newsletter , let me know if you are interested :)",
