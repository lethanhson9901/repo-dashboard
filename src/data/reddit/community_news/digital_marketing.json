      "text": "I'm hoping to get some advice from you guys because I'm completely lost on how this whole thing works. I've been posting a lot lately, but my followers are growing super slow. It feels like whenever real people visit my page, they see my tiny follower count and just leave without even looking at my posts. I'm starting to think that if I just had a bigger number, my profile would look more popular and people would actually want to stay and follow me. That is why I'm looking for a way to get free Instagram followers just to get things moving.   \n  \nI don't really know how any of this stuff operates behind the scenes. I just want a simple site where I can get some free followers to make my account look bigger and more established. I don't want to mess anything up or get my page banned because I don't fully understand it that well. Has anyone here actually figured out what site gives free Instagram followers without getting your account in trouble? Did having that bigger number actually help you attract real people afterwards? I'm just looking for a safe website that works because I don't want to pay for expensive marketing packages. Please let me know if you guys have any suggestions on what to do or where to go",

      "text": "I've been in digital marketing for years and here's something I've been thinking about a lot lately: we've created an entire industry around convincing every single business that they NEED to be on social media. But do they really?\n\nI've worked with local service businesses - plumbers, electricians, dentists - who were spending $2-3k/month on social media management. Their Instagram had maybe 800 followers, most of whom would never use their services. Their posts got 10-20 likes. And they were paying someone to create content every single week.\n\nMeanwhile, the same $2-3k invested in Google Ads or local SEO was bringing in actual leads that converted to paying customers.\n\nHere's what I've noticed:\n\n**Businesses where social media actually matters:**\n- D2C brands where visual content drives purchases\n- Personal brands and creators\n- Restaurants and food businesses (people share food content naturally)\n- Fashion, beauty, lifestyle\n- B2B companies using LinkedIn for thought leadership\n\n**Businesses where social media is mostly a waste:**\n- Local service businesses (plumbing, HVAC, legal)\n- B2B industrial/manufacturing\n- Niche professional services\n- Any business where the customer journey starts with a Google search, not a social feed\n\nThe problem is that agencies won't tell you this because social media management is recurring revenue for them. It's much easier to sell \"you need to post 3x a week\" than to say \"actually, put that budget into SEO and you'll get better results.\"\n\nI'm not saying social media is useless. I'm saying it's not universally necessary, and we should be more honest about which businesses actually benefit from it.\n\nAm I wrong here? Would love to hear from other marketers who've seen both sides.",

          "text": "You are not wrong. I would actually push this further and say the social media question should come AFTER a business figures out where their customers actually discover them. For most local service businesses the answer is Google, referrals, and maybe Nextdoor. Social media is nowhere in that journey.\n\nThe one nuance I would add is that social media for local businesses can work as a trust signal even if it never drives direct leads. When someone Googles a plumber and finds two options, one with an active Facebook page showing real job photos and one with nothing, they are probably picking the first one. But that requires maybe 2-3 posts a month, not a $2k managed strategy.\n\nThe real problem is the agency incentive structure you mentioned. Monthly retainers on social media management are predictable revenue. Telling a client \"honestly just post a job photo once a week yourself\" is good advice but bad for the agency's bottom line. Until agencies start getting paid on outcomes instead of deliverables this dynamic will not change.",

Not with a pitch, but with a specific observation about their current marketing and one idea to improve it. make it about them, not you. The goal is to start a conversation, not sell a service.\n\nhere's why this works: when you're starting from zero, you control only your actions. so focus on what you can do today. a micro-niche makes you an instant expert by comparison. for example, if you do seo, don't say 'seo services'. Say 'seo for independent bookstores in the pacific northwest'. Research those bookstores. find one obvious thing they're missing, maybe local schema markup or a broken blog link.\n\nIn your outreach, mention that. Say 'hey, noticed your site doesn't have local schema, that might be why you're not showing up in local pack results. implementing that is a straightforward fix. If you're interested, I can show you how.' You're not selling; You're teaching. That builds trust.\n\nDo this 20 times, you'll get a few conversations. From those, maybe one or two will turn into clients. It's a numbers game but with high intent. The value prop is clear because you're addressing a pain point they can see. Once you have three clients, deliver insane value so they refer others. Then you can think about branding.",

Target very specific long-tail keywords instead of broad ones. A small site will almost never rank for something like “digital marketing”, but it can rank for “best free tools for local SEO in 2025” or “how to get first 100 visitors to a new website”.\n\n2. Answer search intent better than existing results. Don’t just write 500 words — create the most useful page on that topic (clear steps, examples, FAQs). Google tends to reward content that genuinely solves the problem.\n\n3. Distribute the content where your audience already is. Share the article in niche communities, forums, and places where people are already asking that question. A few early clicks and engagement can help the page get indexed and noticed faster.\n\nSEO feels overwhelming at first, but in reality consistent niche content + solving real problems compounds over time.",

Go after specific long-tail searches that clearly show intent. It’s much easier to rank for “best budgeting app for freelancers in Texas” than “budgeting app.” Small sites win by being specific.\n\nSecond, build **topical clusters**, not random articles. Pick one core topic and create 5–10 tightly related pieces that internally link to each other. This builds topical authority faster than publishing scattered content.\n\nThird, optimize for **clarity and usefulness**, not tricks.

          "text": "Stop trying to do everything at once. Small sites win by being hyper focused not by spreading thin across every SEO tactic you've read about.\n\nThe single biggest lever for a small site is choosing the right keywords to go after. You're not going to rank for \"best running shoes\" against Nike and Wirecutter. But you can absolutely rank for specific long tail stuff that bigger sites don't bother targeting. Think \"best running shoes for flat feet on concrete\" level of specificity. Use Google Search Console if you have it connected already and look at what queries you're actually showing impressions for. Those are your quick wins because Google is already considering you for those terms, you just need to strengthen those pages.\n\nContent depth on a small number of topics beats shallow coverage across dozens. Pick 3 to 5 core topics and become the most thorough resource on the internet for those specific things. We've seen our clients with small sites outrank massive competitors by going deeper not wider. One client with a 30 page site was outranking sites with thousands of pages because every single page was genuinely the best answer for its target query. Google rewards comprehensiveness on a per-page basis not a per-site basis.\n\nTechnical stuff that actually matters for small sites. Make sure your site loads fast on mobile because this is non-negotiable and most small sites are running bloated themes with 15 plugins that tank page speed. Clean up your title tags and meta descriptions so they're specific and compelling not generic. Set up proper internal linking between your pages so Google can understand how your content relates to each other. These three things take maybe a weekend to fix and they'll do more for your traffic than months of trying to build backlinks.\n\nFor tools keep it simple. Google Search Console is free and gives you everything you need to understand how Google sees your site. Ubersuggest or Ahrefs Lite for keyword research if you want to spend a little. AnswerThePublic to find questions people are asking about your topics. You don't need expensive enterprise tools at this stage.\n\nThe thing nobody tells small site owners is that consistency matters more than perfection. Publishing one solid well-researched post per week beats publishing a mediocre post every day. And updating your existing content every few months keeps it ranking better than constantly chasing new topics while old pages decay. Start there and you'll be ahead of 90% of small sites trying to game the algorithm instead of just being genuinely useful.",

Customers are already searching for things on ChatGPt/Google, so if you can show up without ads, that's a win!\n\nFor SEO, honestly you just need Google Search Console! Figure out what your customers are already searching for based on GSC and Google ads data and write blogs on your website answering those questions really well! It's an iterative process and can take time  to build topical authority! If you want an advanced SEO tool, Semrush/Ahrehs is the usual rec but its super outdated imo! If you are looking for a more modern one, Frizerlly is great! They have an AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website!\n\nFinally, for existing customers, you can use tools like Mailchimp/Brevo to send recurring nurturing campaigns over email to upsell or create recurring purchases I guess!

It's the fastest way to prove you can drive real revenue for a business, and it's the skill most in demand for freelance and agency work right now.\n\nHere's why: with SEO you're looking at months before you see results. With Meta ads you're fighting algorithm changes every other week. Google Ads lets you put $500 behind a campaign on Monday and show a client actual leads by Friday. That kind of direct attribution is what gets you hired and what keeps clients paying.\n\nOnce you're solid on Google Ads, learn basic analytics and conversion tracking. Being the person who can say \"we spent X and got Y\" is worth more than being the person who \"manages social media.\"\n\nThe people saying there's no money in marketing are doing the wrong kind of marketing. Performance marketing pays well because the results are measurable. Start there.",

Websites are the center of digital marketing for any brand. \n\nFrom there I self taught Adobe for graphic design, completed Google Ad certificates and can pretty much run any ad campaign on social. \n\nI ended up being a “jack of many trades” and that has served me well.

The core fundamentals still matter, but the job is becoming more about using AI alongside traditional SEO to move faster and make smarter decisions.\n\nAnd you’re right that a lot of people just settle into whatever role they’re handed and stay there, which doesn’t always require much “hustle.” I felt the same way early on, but once I got deeper into SEO and took Digital CEO’s, I decided to lean into the hustle mindset and start my own agency. If you’re mainly focused on skills right now, that’s a great place to be, but if you’re craving that higher ceiling later on, I’d seriously consider building something of your own instead of staying in agency roles forever.\n\nThat said, it’s not for everyone, and there’s nothing wrong with choosing a different path.",

The audience quality dilution at scale is real and most people don't realize the algorithm is basically cherry-picking converters at low spend.\n\n One thing I'd add, the fix isn't just refreshing creative more often, it's building a system where you're testing 3-5 new concepts per week at scale so you always have a winner warming up before the current one dies. We've also seen that restructuring campaigns at higher budgets (breaking out by placement or objective rather than just cranking the daily budget) helps the algorithm avoid that \"going broad\" death spiral. Basically scaling isn't a budget decision, it's an infrastructure decision.   \n  \nwhen you've seen fatigue hit at $500/day, are you typically running broad or interest-stacked audiences? ",

Creative is the ceiling. At low spend you can get by on novelty. At scale, you need a steady pipeline of fresh angles/hooks or CTR drops and CPM climbs.\n\n2. Audience saturation + frequency. You're just showing the same thing to the same people more often.\n\n3. Optimization event mismatch. You scale while optimizing for a shallow event (click/ATC), and it falls apart when you need actual purchase intent.\n\n4. Offer + landing page can't carry volume. your conversion rate is fine for warm traffic, but collapses for cold (trust, clarity, shipping, guarantee).\n\n5. Backend constraints. Slow site, inventory, shipping times, support delays, scale amplifies all of it.  \nRule of thumb: scaling isn't \"turn budget up.\" It's new creatives + broader proof + tighter conversion path.\n\nWhen your campaign collapsed, what moved first, CTR, CPM, CVR, or CPA?

Focus on what you can control.\n\nThe biggest lever I've found is making sure the first 2-3 sentences of your content directly answer the query in plain language. AI Overviews love pulling clean, definitive statements. If your intro is fluffy or takes 200 words to get to the point, you're getting skipped.\n\nAlso, something practical: go check what your competitors' AIO citations actually look like. Open an incognito window, search the query, and read what Google is pulling. You'll usually notice the cited content is structured differently than typical SEO content. Shorter paragraphs, more factual, less keyword-stuffed.",

Tables where comparisons make sense. FAQ schema can help with clarity, but it won’t compensate for weak authority.\n\nBacklinks still matter, especially in competitive niches. But relevant, contextual links beat random link volume.\n\nFor ranking stability:\n\n* Reduce cannibalization across similar pages\n* Strengthen internal linking to your core page\n* Keep updating, but don’t constantly rewrite the whole page\n\nIn short, think entity + topic ownership, not just keyword optimization.

Schema and FAQ markup don’t guarantee inclusion, but they *do* help Google parse your content more reliably, especially when paired with clean headings and scannable formatting. \n\nTo stabilize rankings, focus on building depth around one topic, refresh key pages regularly, strengthen internal linking between related content, and monitor which competitor pages are being cited then reverse-engineer their structure and answer style.

AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude actually decide what to show people and honestly it's so different from how Google works .( This is a basic explanation, will be diving into it more in my newsletter )\n\nbasically these AI tools don't just rank websites like Google does. They pull information from sources that are authoritative, detailed and actually useful for answering the specific question someone asked. Which means the whole traditional SEO game kind of shifts here.\n\nWhat actually matters for getting your product or business noticed by AI:\n\nYour product pages need to be really thorough. Like specs, pricing, reviews, availability, what makes you different. The more complete it is the better chance the AI picks it up when someone asks a relevant question.\n\nStructure your content properly. Headers, lists, tables, schema markup. AI models parse structured content way more easily than big walls of text.\n\nWrite content that actually answers questions people are asking. Detailed guides, comparisons, conversational explanations. Think about what someone would literally type into ChatGPT and make sure your content answers that.\n\nGet mentioned on credible sites. Backlinks and reviews from trusted sources signal that you're legit.( This one is pretty imp)\n\neverything should be updated. Stale outdated info gets ignored completely.\n\nAnd this thing is called GEO, Generative Engine Optimization, which is basically optimizing so that AI tools like ChatGPT and Google actually recommend and mention your brand when someone asks a relevant question. It's like SEO but for AI search instead of traditional Google rankings.\n\nwill be writing about this in detail in my newsletter , let me know if you are interested :)",

AI tools can analyze large data sets, predict user behavior, automate content creation, and personalize communication at scale.\n\nHowever, AI does not replace strategy. It enhances it.\n\nFor example, AI can suggest keyword opportunities, analyze competitor content, and generate ad copy variations. But human marketers still define positioning, brand voice, and long term direction.\n\nThe future belongs to marketers who combine creativity with technology. Those who rely only on automation risk sounding generic. Those who ignore AI risk falling behind in efficiency.\n\nAI is not about replacing marketers.

But the reality of advertising in 2026 is that you shouldn't fight the platform. Meta's AI can process millions of real-time signals to find conversions in ways human media buyers simply cannot.\n\nBecause the AI has essentially taken over the audience targeting and bid optimization, the human strategy hasn't disappeared, it just shifted. Creative is the new targeting. You let the AI find the buyers, and you spend your human brainpower testing different angles, hooks, and ad copy. The algorithm learns who to target based purely on what creative they interact with.\n\nYou definitely shouldn't blindly trust it on day one. Run a clean A/B test against your manual campaigns before going all-in.

It's that you can now pressure test 20 different positioning angles before you even brief your team.

I've seen brands hand their entire content calendar to AI and then act surprised when nobody cares. Your POV is the product. AI can help you say it better, it can't give you something to say.\n\nThe marketers doing it well right now aren't the ones with the biggest AI stack.

Llevamos varios años viendo cómo el contenido publicado bajo un nombre de persona genera más engagement que el publicado bajo un logo corporativo en prácticamente todas las plataformas: LinkedIn, Twitter/X, YouTube, e incluso en búsqueda orgánica donde los autores con E-E-A-T consolidado tienen ventaja.\n\n\n\nEl motivo es psicológico antes que algorítmico: la gente sigue a personas, no a empresas. Una marca personal comunica perspectiva, opinión y experiencia de primera mano, cosas que el contenido corporativo evita por miedo a la controversia. Esa fricción entre \"lo que la empresa puede decir\" y \"lo que el especialista realmente piensa\" es donde la marca personal gana.\n\n\n\nDesde el punto de vista de marketing digital, lo que estamos viendo es el auge del modelo de \"marca paraguas\": una empresa que cultiva las marcas personales de sus empleados clave y luego las conecta con la marca corporativa. Es lo que hacen bien empresas como HubSpot o Ahrefs, cuyos especialistas son más conocidos que la propia empresa en algunos nichos.\n\n\n\nEl riesgo es la dependencia: si el experto se va, se lleva la audiencia. Por eso las empresas inteligentes construyen los dos canales en paralelo, usando la marca personal como punta de lanza para generar confianza y la marca corporativa para convertir y retener. No es una competencia, son capas complementarias del mismo funnel.",

Especially in B2B and professional services.\n\nWhy it's happening:\n\n1. People buy from people, not logos. A founder or expert with a personal brand feels more authentic than a faceless company account.\n2. Algorithm favoritism. LinkedIn, X, and Instagram prioritize personal accounts over business pages. Your personal post will get 5–10x the reach of the same post from your company page.\n3. Trust has shifted. People trust individual experts more than brand messaging. They want to see the humans behind the company.\n4. Content flexibility. Personal brands can share opinions, behind-the-scenes, and personality. Company brands have to stay “on message” and corporate.\n\nReal examples from our clients:\n\n* CEO’s LinkedIn posts driving 70% of qualified leads while company page drives 10%\n* Founder’s personal brand landing partnership deals before the company website even gets looked at\n* Team members with personal brands being headhunted, which actually helps company recruiting (“your team is impressive”)\n\nThe catch:\n\nPersonal branding works if you're willing to show up consistently. It's not a shortcut. You can't automate personality.\n\nAnd there's risk: if that person leaves, the audience often goes with them.\n\nThe smart play:\n\nBuild both. Let key team members (founders, executives, subject matter experts) build personal brands that elevate the company brand. The personal brands drive trust and leads. The company brand provides stability and credibility.\n\nPersonal brand gets you in the door. Company brand closes the deal.\n\nIs this a long-term shift?\n\nYes. We're not going back to trusting faceless corporations over individual experts. If anything, this trend accelerates as AI-generated content floods the market and people crave authentic human voices even more.",

A founder builds trust publicly.\n2. The audience connects with the founder.\n3. The founder points toward the company.\n4. The company becomes credible by association.\n\nIt’s a bridge.\n\nNot a competition.\n\n\n\nIf you’re deciding where to focus, here’s a simple guide:\n\nIf you’re early-stage:  \n→ Build the personal brand first.  \nIt’s faster, cheaper, and more flexible.\n\nIf you’re scaling:  \n→ Build both.  \nLet the personal brand drive awareness.  \nLet the company brand handle structure and scale.\n\nIf you’re hiding behind a logo:  \n→ That’s a mistake in 2026.\n\n\n\nHere’s the uncomfortable truth:\n\nIn crowded markets,  \nthe founder is often the differentiator.\n\nYour product can be copied.  \nYour pricing can be matched.  \nYour messaging can be mimicked.\n\nYour perspective can’t.\n\nThat’s why personal branding feels like it’s “outperforming.”\n\nIt’s not louder.  \nIt’s more believable.\n\n\n\nHere is my Final take:\n\nCompany branding builds infrastructure.  \nPersonal branding builds influence.\n\nInfluence travels faster.\n\nAnd in today’s attention economy, speed of trust matters.\n\nSo no, personal branding isn’t replacing company branding.\n\nBut if you ignore it, you’re choosing to grow slower.\n\nHope that helps.",

Second month you've already caught the easy ones, and now a few other people found the pond too. The fish are still there, you just have to work a bit harder per catch.\n\nBut honestly the bigger issue is timing. If you wait until CPL rises to have this conversation, you've already lost. The client has already decided something is wrong. I started including a \"what to expect at 2x budget\" slide in every onboarding deck. Nothing fancy, just a simple chart showing that doubling spend typically gets you 1.5-1.7x the results, not 2x. Setting that expectation early means when it actually happens, the client goes \"oh right, you mentioned this\" instead of \"what went wrong.\"\n\nThe other thing that helps is reframing the metric. Instead of cost per lead going up, show total leads going up. Most clients care about volume more than efficiency anyway. If they went from 30 leads to 48 leads, that's a win even if each one cost a bit more.",

I have had clients where CPL went up 40% but their close rate on those leads also improved because the broader audience included people further along in their buying journey.

Those people got better AND faster.\n\nI have also seen marketers use it to skip the thinking entirely. Prompt in, content out, publish, move on. No editing, no original angle, no understanding of why the copy works or does not. That is the \"identical content\" problem you are noticing. You can spot AI assisted content that had no human judgment layered on top from a mile away.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that AI exposes the gap between people who were already good at strategy and people who were just good at execution. If your entire value was writing decent copy quickly, yeah, that is getting commoditized fast. But if your value was knowing WHAT to write and WHY, AI just made you more dangerous.\n\nFor me personally, the biggest improvement has been in analysis and research speed, not content generation. Being able to quickly synthesize competitive data or spot patterns in campaign performance has been genuinely useful. The content side I still heavily edit because the default output reads like a Wikipedia article.",

          "text": "I can't say anything specifically about those programs, besides that it is plausible that some of these are basically pay-for-internship programs where you get on the job training for a company/agency that already has a client base and needs trained resources. But I'd still approach it with a very high amount of skepticism, especially if you are paying up front.\n\nGenerally speaking, most of these \"accelerator\" type of programs are basically just repackaging certification programs that you can already get for free and better from the direct source. Google Marketing certifications (free from Google), Hubspot certifications (free from hubspot), various courses from Facebook/Meta and Salesforce (Trailblazer), etc. \n\nSo from that perspective, getting the actual certification would be a lot more reputable and broadly applicable than some certificate from a for-profit group nobody has heard about.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m an independent filmmaker working with a small youth team. We have our own production team called Montage Motion Pictures. We’ve been producing short films and, الحمدلله, we’ve been fortunate enough to win some international awards.\n\nOur main problem right now is marketing and audience growth.\n\nWe do all our marketing ourselves because we don’t have the budget to hire social media managers or content creators. Our team is very small, and our main focus is writing, shooting, and editing films. On top of that, we’re also handling everything else like graphic design, editing social media videos, posters, and managing accounts.\n\nThe issue is that despite putting a lot of effort into our content, our views and followers are still very low.\n\nFE, I created a short AI video imagining our film’s main character as if he was a character in Fortnite. It was just for fun and didn’t represent the real film or our usual style.\n\nBut surprisingly, that video got significantly more views than our actual film content and official posts.\n\nThis made us question a lot of things:\n\nAre we approaching content the wrong way?\n\nDo audiences connect more with entertaining / trend-based content than with actual film content?\n\nAre we being too serious with our marketing?\n\nWe’d really appreciate honest feedback and advice:\n\n* What do you think could be the problem?\n* How important is posting frequency vs content quality?\n* Should filmmakers focus on “secondary content” even if it’s not their main passion?\n* How do you balance filmmaking and content creation without burning out?\n\nAnother important point: we are Arab filmmakers.\n\n* How can we reach non-Arabic speaking audiences?\n* Is it necessary to create a separate English account, or is bilingual content enough?\n\nAlso, we’re considering creating an AI UGC avatar to act as the “public face” of our brand and represent our production team online.\n\n* Do you recommend this?\n* If yes, what style, age, and personality would work best for a film production brand targeting young audiences?\n\nFinally, the most important question:\n\nHow can we create strong, effective content without extreme pressure and burnout?\n\nIf anyone is willing to review our account and give honest criticism, we’d be very grateful.\n\nThank you so much.\n\ninstagram: \"@montage\\_mpictures\"  \ntiktok: \"@montage\\_pictures\"",

          "text": "First, congrats on the awards. That tells me the filmmaking is strong. This sounds more like a distribution issue than a quality issue. Film content and social content are different games. Social platforms reward personality, process, and native content, not just polished final work. The Fortnite-style clip likely worked because it felt platform-native. A few quick thoughts: Do not use social only as a trailer feed. Show behind the scenes, writing process, challenges, and character stories. Secondary content is not a distraction. It is how people discover you. For non-Arab audiences, strong subtitles and occasional bilingual captions are usually enough. A separate account can split growth early on. I would avoid an AI avatar. For filmmakers, real faces and authentic stories usually connect more. Keep it simple to avoid burnout. ",
