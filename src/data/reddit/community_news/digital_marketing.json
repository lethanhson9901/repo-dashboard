      "text": "I'm hoping to get some advice from you guys because I'm completely lost on how this whole thing works. I've been posting a lot lately, but my followers are growing super slow. It feels like whenever real people visit my page, they see my tiny follower count and just leave without even looking at my posts. I'm starting to think that if I just had a bigger number, my profile would look more popular and people would actually want to stay and follow me. That is why I'm looking for a way to get free Instagram followers just to get things moving.   \n  \nI don't really know how any of this stuff operates behind the scenes. I just want a simple site where I can get some free followers to make my account look bigger and more established. I don't want to mess anything up or get my page banned because I don't fully understand it that well. Has anyone here actually figured out what site gives free Instagram followers without getting your account in trouble? Did having that bigger number actually help you attract real people afterwards? I'm just looking for a safe website that works because I don't want to pay for expensive marketing packages. Please let me know if you guys have any suggestions on what to do or where to go",

Usually, during valentines week, I see a lot of footfalls so this year I planned to advertise on google ads and meta (facebook/instagram). I advertised last year in early august because that is usually an off season and i don’t have a lot of customers. But i was shocked to see that my ads did much well in August than they’re doing right now. (ROAS was 3 in August but it’s barely scrapping by to 2 now, Conversion rate is down by 20%). I even hired a web developer and designer to design an attractive website connected to a landing page, asked my customers to leave a good review (in exchange of 5% discount) but now i’m really confused. I’ve done it all. Would it be a good idea to consult a marketing agency? I don’t have a lot of disposable funds right now but I can’t see any other option.",

Did your cost per click increase significantly?\n2. Is traffic quality similar, or are you reaching broader audiences?\n3. Are you seeing more window shoppers during peak season?\n4. Did average order value change?\n\nAlso, during gift-heavy seasons, timing matters a lot. Early planners behave differently from last-minute buyers.\n\nInstead of “I’ve done it all,” I’d isolate where the drop happened:\n\n– Traffic problem?  \n– Conversion problem?  \n– Cost problem?  \n– Offer problem?\n\nAgencies can help, but clarity on where the leak is will save you money before paying anyone else.",

When supply increases along with demand, costs go up. In August, there may be less competition, which could be one possible reason for better performance during that period.\n\nLess attractive Ad copy and creative as compare to competitors could also be a reason. Think of it this way: if people are seeing better ads compared to yours and have more attractive options in the market, they may still see your ads but not click on them. This results in a lower CTR, which increases costs and ultimately decreases ROAS.\n\nThese are the possible reasons based on my understanding, without knowing more details about your ads and business.\n\n5% off and conversion rate 20% down - For these occassion people not think about money more they think best of best product for their loved ones and if other people have better products and better way of messaging and ads they will get more.",

It's a sign that you were competing against every other gift shop in your market during the most expensive ad auction of the year for your category. CPMs during Valentine's week can easily 2-3x compared to off season. So the same ad that printed money in August will look mediocre when the auction is flooded.\n\nThe thing I'd actually look at is your repeat customer rate. A gift shop lives and dies by returning buyers. If someone bought from you last Valentine's, did you email them in January? Did you text them a week before with a \"your order from last year\" reminder? That's basically free revenue you're leaving on the table.\n\nAlso worth checking your Google Ads search terms report. During peak seasons you attract way more junk traffic from broad match queries. I'd bet you're paying for clicks from people searching for free printable cards or DIY gift ideas who were never going to buy anything.",

It’s not always about the site or creative either, sometimes, bidding just gets too aggressive and your usual strategies stop working. Before you spend money on an agency, you might want to take a deep dive into your targeting and timing. Try narrowing your audience, tweaking your ad copy to speak directly to last-minute gifters, and maybe adjusting your budget to off-peak hours. Also, compare your August campaign settings with what you ran this time. Even small changes in geo, device, or placements can make a big difference. \n\nDon’t ignore platforms like Pinterest or even local groups on Facebook, as people shop for gifts there too. Setting up automated rules to pause underperforming ads can help stretch your budget. There are AI-powered tools like 4XDigital AI that can automate creative testing and optimize your campaigns across multiple channels, which is helpful if you’re strapped for time. But honestly, sometimes it just comes down to timing and market saturation. Keep testing, and don’t feel pressured to throw money at an agency unless you really hit a wall.",

      "text": "I have been evaluating aeo tools bc my cmo wants ai search optimization. Most tools show pretty dashboards, but can't prove true impact. Tested four platforms and here's my raw experience with them:\n\n**profound** ($500-600/mo):\n\n* beautiful dashboards, genuinely impressive demos\n* the data accuracy is questionable. ran the same queries manually and got different results\n* attribution model feels like it's built to make their numbers look good, not give you real data\n* support was responsive, but when I pushed on methodology they started ghosting me \n\nverdict: expensive way to feel like you're doing something\n\n**hubspot**:\n\n* feels like it was not part of the plan. like someone said -we need an ai feature two weeks before launch\n* if you're already in hubspot ecosystem it's free, but the insights are surface-level\n* can't tell you which ai engines are citing you or why \n\nverdict: checkbox feature, not a real solution\n\n**otterly** ($100-150/mo):\n\n* decent monitoring and alerts\n* good for 'are we showing up' but not for 'why and what to do about it.'\n* limited on the strategy plus optimization side \n\nverdict: fine for monitoring, not enough for optimizatin\n\n**Limy**:\n\n* only one that actually showed me which prompts are generating traffic and tied it to revenue\n* attribution model is transparent - you can see the methodology\n* not perfect - ui could use work, some features feel early\n* but the core data is accurate and actionable\n\nverdict: best for practitioners who actually need to attribute ai traffic to pipeline\n\nHave you tested any of these vendors or any other, and what was your experience?",

Like you might be visible in ChatGPT but completely absent from Gemini or Claude, and the reasons why are totally different per model.\n\nAlso the \"attribution\" piece is tricky because AI referral traffic shows up differently in analytics depending on whether the user clicked a citation link vs just typed your brand name after seeing it in an AI answer. The second one is basically dark traffic and most tools cant capture it.\n\nWe've been building something at vectorgap that tracks share of voice across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and Perplexity simultaneously -- the cross-model view is what makes it useful imo because optimizing for one model can actually hurt you on another. Like Perplexity heavily weights source recency while Claude seems to care more about structured factual content.\n\nDid you test any of those four tools on multi-model tracking? Curious if Limy covers beyond ChatGPT.",

Helps with brainstorms, reports and what not\n* **Google Nano Banana:** Helps us replace items/things in the image without changing anything else. Great for consistent characters and subjects across multiple images! Can also \n* **Canva**: Yes, it gets clowned on sometimes, but honestly Canva is the best tool for non-designers who need fast creative. My team whips up ads, sales decks, and social content way faster here than waiting on design queues. \n* **Loom**: Can’t tell you how helpful it is for async communication and documentation to just record my screen while I’m taking and send it to someone. Hidden gem: AI transcription is a nice feature. These also work for recording product demos. \n* **Frizerlly**: Their AI agent can learn all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog on our website every day! We usually let is publish as a draft and manually switch it to published after a quick review! \n* **Hotjar**: If you’re not tracking how users move on your site, you’re flying blind. Heatmaps and recordings help me figure out why people bounce or where they get stuck. \n* **Zapier**: I’ve got zaps running for everything from lead routing to Slack alerts for new demo requests. The stuff it automates behind the scenes saves me from mind-numbing tasks. \n\nAnd that's about it! I know its not one but hope it helps someone :)",

Interesting to watch which ones rise before the ad money floods in",

AI platforms don't have that runway. If ChatGPT answers start feeling like sponsored content, people will just switch to Claude or Perplexity or whatever else pops up next week.That competitive pressure is actually what might keep things honest. Google became a monopoly and then got lazy with quality. The AI space is way too fragmented right now for anyone to pull that off.Also worth noting that $60 CPM with a $200k floor basically means OpenAI is treating this like premium TV advertising, not search. They're going after brand dollars, not performance marketing budgets. Two totally different games.",

It's the fastest way to prove you can drive real revenue for a business, and it's the skill most in demand for freelance and agency work right now.\n\nHere's why: with SEO you're looking at months before you see results. With Meta ads you're fighting algorithm changes every other week. Google Ads lets you put $500 behind a campaign on Monday and show a client actual leads by Friday. That kind of direct attribution is what gets you hired and what keeps clients paying.\n\nOnce you're solid on Google Ads, learn basic analytics and conversion tracking. Being the person who can say \"we spent X and got Y\" is worth more than being the person who \"manages social media.\"\n\nThe people saying there's no money in marketing are doing the wrong kind of marketing. Performance marketing pays well because the results are measurable. Start there.",

The core fundamentals still matter, but the job is becoming more about using AI alongside traditional SEO to move faster and make smarter decisions.\n\nAnd you’re right that a lot of people just settle into whatever role they’re handed and stay there, which doesn’t always require much “hustle.” I felt the same way early on, but once I got deeper into SEO and took Digital CEO’s, I decided to lean into the hustle mindset and start my own agency. If you’re mainly focused on skills right now, that’s a great place to be, but if you’re craving that higher ceiling later on, I’d seriously consider building something of your own instead of staying in agency roles forever.\n\nThat said, it’s not for everyone, and there’s nothing wrong with choosing a different path.",

The conversion thing is real but you gotta be careful with small sample sizes -- when you only have like 50-100 AI referral visits a month, one good session skews the whole conversion rate.\n\nWhat we track for our clients: set up a GA4 segment for chatgpt.com, perplexity.ai, claude.ai, gemini.google.com as referral sources. Then compare session quality (pages/session, time on site) vs organic. In our data the engagement metrics are consistently better, but the volume is still tiny for most SaaS -- like you said, 1-2% max.\n\nThe industries seeing the most AI referral traffic right now are dev tools and marketing software, probably because those audiences are heavy AI users themselves.\n\nRe: getting more referrals -- its less about chasing AI overviews and more about being the brand that AI models already \"know\" about. Getting mentioned in comparison articles, forums, reviews. The models pull from those sources heavily. If your brand shows up in 10 independent comparisons, AI will start recommending you naturally.\n\nWhat category is your SaaS in?",

YouTube + implementation\nNot “binge watch.”\nSearch specific problems:\n\n“How to run Facebook ads for local businesses”\n“How to cold email for SMMA”\n“How to structure a landing page”\nThen actually do it. Break stuff. Fix it. Repeat.\n\n2. Get results for yourself first\nRun a theme page.\nStart a small affiliate site.\nGrow a local service IG.\nYou’ll learn more managing $50 of your own ad spend than from 20 hours of course videos.\n\n3. Offer free/cheap work to get reps\nDM local businesses.\n“Hey, I’ll run your ads for free, you just cover ad spend.”\nNow you’re learning on real money, real stakes.\n\n4. Reverse engineer people already winning\nStudy their:\n\nHooks\nOffers\nLanding pages\nEmail flows\nYou can literally sign up to their funnels and see how it works.\n\n5. Free platforms > paid gurus\nTwitter/X threads\nReddit case studies\nIndie Hackers\nMeta + Google official documentation\nShopify blog\nHubSpot blog\n\nThe actual info isn’t secret. The execution is.\n\nWhat courses really sell is:\n\nStructure\nAccountability\nCommunity\nNot magic knowledge.\nIf someone can’t show live proof (screen share, Stripe dashboard, ad accounts in real time), assume it’s marketing.\n\nThe people quietly making $5k–$20k/month usually aren’t selling courses. They’re too busy fulfilling.\n\nIf you’re trying to get into DM, what lane? Ads, content, email, SEO, affiliate, local lead gen? That part matters way more than buying a course.",

Pick one, get good at it for a real business (even your own side project), and the rest starts clicking.\n\nexpanding\\_crystal's comment here about \"psychic damage\" is painfully real though lol.

I started with just two things: the 'Senator We Run Ads' YouTube channel, one of the best places to learn and define your path in digital marketing, and Coursera (I took Google's 6-month Digital Marketing & E-commerce program).\nOnce I finished that program (which covers the basics and fundamentals), I moved on to the Google Ads and GA4 certifications. There are a ton of certs out there, but I recommend focusing on the main ones: Search, Display, Shopping, Measurement, and GA4.\nHowever, even after finishing the program and the certs, I only had a vague idea of the theory. I hadn't put any of it into practice aside from some small organic/social experiments. To really learn the complex stuff like CRM, marketing automation, and how to actually run Google/Meta Ads I took a 6-month internship at a digital agency. It was basically unpaid.\nDid I starve? Yes. But I learned a ton. It connected all the missing dots: I saw how digital channels work for real businesses, how to pull marketing levers, build campaigns, analyze data, create reports, and make data-driven decisions. From that point on, everything got much easier and the agency offered me a permanent contract.\nIn my experience, you need to be more of a generalist than a specialist to survive the AI era. You might start as a specialist in your role, but you need to understand how the entire ecosystem works. If you cover all the basics like SEO, Paid Ads, CRM/Email, Social, Analytics, and Attribution you’ll be able to pivot into almost any role in the future.\nHope that my experience helps. If you need more information send me a DM.",

It's can be social media, PR, email, advertising etc. \n\nYou have to choose one topic to be expert in that. In m'y case it's social media.

You won’t get massive exposure easily, but the engagement you do get is usually higher quality. It works best when you have a clear niche and a strong point of view.\n\nPaid ads are great for scale and speed. Organic is better for authority and long-term brand building. I don’t see it as either/or. Ads can drive traffic, but organic builds credibility so that traffic actually converts.\n\nIf organic feels dead, it’s usually because the content is too generic. Platforms still reward strong opinions, storytelling, and real value. It’s harder now, but not useless.",

This is why organic can still work incredibly well, but only if your content is built for discovery, not just for your existing audience.\n\n\n\nWhat this means practically:\n\n\n\n\\- Your content needs to hook strangers in 1-2 seconds, not just resonate with people who already know you\n\n\\- Saves and shares matter more than likes now - they signal to the algorithm that your content has long-term value\n\n\\- Reels/short video still gets the most organic distribution on IG and Facebook. Static posts are shown primarily to existing followers\n\n\\- LinkedIn is genuinely the best platform for organic reach right now if you're B2B. The algorithm there still favors engagement over ad spend\n\n\n\nPaid and organic shouldn't compete - they should complement each other. Use organic to test what content resonates, then amplify the winners with paid. If you're putting ad budget behind content that doesn't work organically, you're just paying to show people content they don't care about.\n\n\n\nThe people saying organic is dead are usually the ones still posting like it's 2020 - static images, generic captions, broad hashtags.

Instead of hunting for the perfect AI, build a simple system: define what your brand voice actually sounds like in writing, create a short style guide (tone, common phrases, what you'd never say), then use that as your quality filter for any tool output.\n\n\n\nFor service businesses especially, I'd start with the highest-touch communication first. Incoming calls and appointment booking matter more than social captions. That's where a voice receptionist trained on your actual business info, hours, and how you handle customer questions pays off immediately. You skip the robotic experience entirely and capture leads that would otherwise walk. Then use content tools for lower-stakes stuff where editing feels less painful.",

I also keep a small swipe file of posts that perform well and literally prompt the model with “write in this style, but about X.”\nWhatever stack you use, having a short “brand voice guardrail” doc (phrases you use, phrases you avoid, POV on the topic) and past high-performing examples in the prompt makes a bigger difference than which AI tool you pick.",

Clear topical depth (not just one good page).\n\nIf you have one strong article and competitors have a cluster (guide + comparisons + FAQs + supporting posts), \nGoogle trusts them more as a source.\n\nTopical authority isn’t a buzzword — it’s basically:\n\n“Do you cover this subject completely or just partially?”\n\n2. Clean structure + direct answers.\n\nAI summaries pull concise, structured answers.\nPages that:\n•\tAnswer the query early\n•\tUse clear subheadings\n•\tHave short, factual paragraphs\n… tend to get referenced more.\n\nFAQ sections help — not because of schema magic, but because they force clarity.\n\n3. Entity clarity > raw backlinks (in many cases).\n\nBacklinks still matter. \nBut I’ve seen lower DR sites get featured because their content is tighter and more aligned to the query intent.\nIf your brand/entity isn’t clearly associated with the topic, AI Overviews may skip you even if you rank.\n\nOn ranking fluctuations\n\nStability lately comes from:\n\n•\tUpdating content more frequently\n•\tPruning overlapping pages (keyword cannibalization is brutal now)\n•\tStrengthening internal linking within topic clusters\n•\tTightening search intent alignment\n\nIf rankings swing hard, check:\n\n•\tAre you mixing informational + commercial intent?\n•\tAre competitors refreshing content more often?\n•\tAre you over-optimizing for keywords instead of answering the actual question?",

Google is constantly tweaking which queries trigger them and which sources get cited. I've watched the same page appear in AIO for a query, disappear for two weeks, then come back.\n\nSo don't chase stability in a system that isn't stable yet. Focus on what you can control.\n\nThe biggest lever I've found is making sure the first 2-3 sentences of your content directly answer the query in plain language. AI Overviews love pulling clean, definitive statements. If your intro is fluffy or takes 200 words to get to the point, you're getting skipped.\n\nAlso, something practical: go check what your competitors' AIO citations actually look like. Open an incognito window, search the query, and read what Google is pulling. You'll usually notice the cited content is structured differently than typical SEO content. Shorter paragraphs, more factual, less keyword-stuffed.",

If competitors are getting featured, check whether they have multiple supporting pages around the same topic. Topical depth often matters more than a single backlink spike.\n\nSecond, structure helps, but it’s not magic.  \nClear H2s that match real questions. Short, direct answer blocks near the top. Tables where comparisons make sense. FAQ schema can help with clarity, but it won’t compensate for weak authority.\n\nBacklinks still matter, especially in competitive niches. But relevant, contextual links beat random link volume.\n\nFor ranking stability:\n\n* Reduce cannibalization across similar pages\n* Strengthen internal linking to your core page\n* Keep updating, but don’t constantly rewrite the whole page\n\nIn short, think entity + topic ownership, not just keyword optimization. AI summaries usually pull from pages that look like definitive resources, not just optimized ones.",

In practice, pages that get pulled into AI summaries usually do three things well: \n\n(1) tightly match search intent with concise, direct answers near the top of the page,\n\n (2) sit within a strong topical cluster (not isolated posts), and \n\n(3) demonstrate credibility signals (quality links, brand mentions, author expertise). Schema and FAQ markup don’t guarantee inclusion, but they *do* help Google parse your content more reliably, especially when paired with clean headings and scannable formatting. \n\nTo stabilize rankings, focus on building depth around one topic, refresh key pages regularly, strengthen internal linking between related content, and monitor which competitor pages are being cited then reverse-engineer their structure and answer style. Think less about “ranking tricks” and more about becoming the **most extractable, trustworthy answer source** in your niche.",

AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude actually decide what to show people and honestly it's so different from how Google works .( This is a basic explanation, will be diving into it more in my newsletter )\n\nbasically these AI tools don't just rank websites like Google does. They pull information from sources that are authoritative, detailed and actually useful for answering the specific question someone asked. Which means the whole traditional SEO game kind of shifts here.\n\nWhat actually matters for getting your product or business noticed by AI:\n\nYour product pages need to be really thorough. Like specs, pricing, reviews, availability, what makes you different. The more complete it is the better chance the AI picks it up when someone asks a relevant question.\n\nStructure your content properly. Headers, lists, tables, schema markup. AI models parse structured content way more easily than big walls of text.\n\nWrite content that actually answers questions people are asking. Detailed guides, comparisons, conversational explanations. Think about what someone would literally type into ChatGPT and make sure your content answers that.\n\nGet mentioned on credible sites. Backlinks and reviews from trusted sources signal that you're legit.( This one is pretty imp)\n\neverything should be updated. Stale outdated info gets ignored completely.\n\nAnd this thing is called GEO, Generative Engine Optimization, which is basically optimizing so that AI tools like ChatGPT and Google actually recommend and mention your brand when someone asks a relevant question. It's like SEO but for AI search instead of traditional Google rankings.\n\nwill be writing about this in detail in my newsletter , let me know if you are interested :)",

Target very specific long-tail keywords instead of broad ones. A small site will almost never rank for something like “digital marketing”, but it can rank for “best free tools for local SEO in 2025” or “how to get first 100 visitors to a new website”.\n\n2. Answer search intent better than existing results. Don’t just write 500 words — create the most useful page on that topic (clear steps, examples, FAQs). Google tends to reward content that genuinely solves the problem.\n\n3. Distribute the content where your audience already is. Share the article in niche communities, forums, and places where people are already asking that question. A few early clicks and engagement can help the page get indexed and noticed faster.\n\nSEO feels overwhelming at first, but in reality consistent niche content + solving real problems compounds over time.",

Smaller sites usually win by going deep, not wide.\n\nA simple framework we’ve seen work:\n\n**1. Start with problem-first keyword clusters**  \nInstead of targeting one big keyword, build 5–10 pieces around one specific problem.  \nExample: rather than “AI for business”, create content like:  \n• AI workflow for recruiters  \n• AI data enrichment steps  \n• Automation mistakes beginners make  \nThis builds topical authority faster.\n\n**2. Publish “actionable” content, not generic content**  \nGoogle rewards usefulness. Checklists, templates, step-by-steps, and real workflows outperform theory posts.\n\n**3. Internal linking is underrated**  \nMost small sites publish posts but never connect them. Link every new article to 2–3 older ones. It helps crawling and increases time on site.\n\n**4. Update > publish more**  \nRefreshing an existing article (better examples, screenshots, FAQs) often drives more traffic than writing a new one.\n\n**5. Distribute where your audience already hangs out**  \nReddit, LinkedIn comments, niche communities. Not to sell — just to add context and insights. Consistent helpful participation builds authority and referral traffic.\n\n**6. Technical basics matter**  \nFast pages, clear headings, schema where relevant, and strong search intent alignment.\n\nOrganic growth for small sites is less about hacks and more about compounding useful content around a niche problem.\n\nCurious: what niche is your site in?

Meta's AI can process millions of real-time signals to find conversions in ways human media buyers simply cannot.\n\nBecause the AI has essentially taken over the audience targeting and bid optimization, the human strategy hasn't disappeared, it just shifted. Creative is the new targeting. You let the AI find the buyers, and you spend your human brainpower testing different angles, hooks, and ad copy. The algorithm learns who to target based purely on what creative they interact with.\n\nYou definitely shouldn't blindly trust it on day one.

However, AI still doesn’t replace strategy it amplifies it. Human marketers remain responsible for positioning, brand voice, creative direction, and long-term growth decisions. \n\nThis is where modern tools are becoming powerful force multipliers. Platforms like **Runable** help teams operationalize AI by automating multi-step growth workflows, monitoring intent signals, and connecting data across the stack so marketers can move faster with less manual effort. Meanwhile, tools such as **Canva AI** accelerate creative production, and **ChatGPT** supports research, ideation, and copy variation at scale. The real competitive advantage going forward will belong to marketers who thoughtfully combine human insight with AI-powered execution because over-automation leads to generic output, while ignoring AI leads to lost speed and efficiency.",

But I'd still approach it with a very high amount of skepticism, especially if you are paying up front.\n\nGenerally speaking, most of these \"accelerator\" type of programs are basically just repackaging certification programs that you can already get for free and better from the direct source. Google Marketing certifications (free from Google), Hubspot certifications (free from hubspot), various courses from Facebook/Meta and Salesforce (Trailblazer), etc. \n\nSo from that perspective, getting the actual certification would be a lot more reputable and broadly applicable than some certificate from a for-profit group nobody has heard about.",

We’ve been producing short films and, الحمدلله, we’ve been fortunate enough to win some international awards.\n\nOur main problem right now is marketing and audience growth.\n\nWe do all our marketing ourselves because we don’t have the budget to hire social media managers or content creators. Our team is very small, and our main focus is writing, shooting, and editing films. On top of that, we’re also handling everything else like graphic design, editing social media videos, posters, and managing accounts.\n\nThe issue is that despite putting a lot of effort into our content, our views and followers are still very low.\n\nFE, I created a short AI video imagining our film’s main character as if he was a character in Fortnite. It was just for fun and didn’t represent the real film or our usual style.\n\nBut surprisingly, that video got significantly more views than our actual film content and official posts.\n\nThis made us question a lot of things:\n\nAre we approaching content the wrong way?\n\nDo audiences connect more with entertaining / trend-based content than with actual film content?\n\nAre we being too serious with our marketing?\n\nWe’d really appreciate honest feedback and advice:\n\n* What do you think could be the problem?\n* How important is posting frequency vs content quality?\n* Should filmmakers focus on “secondary content” even if it’s not their main passion?\n* How do you balance filmmaking and content creation without burning out?\n\nAnother important point: we are Arab filmmakers.\n\n* How can we reach non-Arabic speaking audiences?\n* Is it necessary to create a separate English account, or is bilingual content enough?\n\nAlso, we’re considering creating an AI UGC avatar to act as the “public face” of our brand and represent our production team online.\n\n* Do you recommend this?\n* If yes, what style, age, and personality would work best for a film production brand targeting young audiences?\n\nFinally, the most important question:\n\nHow can we create strong, effective content without extreme pressure and burnout?\n\nIf anyone is willing to review our account and give honest criticism, we’d be very grateful.\n\nThank you so much.\n\ninstagram: \"@montage\\_mpictures\"  \ntiktok: \"@montage\\_pictures\"",

Film content and social content are different games. Social platforms reward personality, process, and native content, not just polished final work. The Fortnite-style clip likely worked because it felt platform-native. A few quick thoughts: Do not use social only as a trailer feed. Show behind the scenes, writing process, challenges, and character stories. Secondary content is not a distraction. It is how people discover you. For non-Arab audiences, strong subtitles and occasional bilingual captions are usually enough. A separate account can split growth early on. I would avoid an AI avatar. For filmmakers, real faces and authentic stories usually connect more. Keep it simple to avoid burnout. ",
