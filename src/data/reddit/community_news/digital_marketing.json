      "text": "It feels really hard to get a new page going when nobody wants to be the first one to follow. I have been thinking about if I should buy Instagram followers just so I look established enough that real people actually look at my content. I have checked a few sites that say they can help, but a lot of them look risky or like they just sell bots.\n\nDoes anyone know a safe way to do this without getting flagged? I’m looking for instant fame, just a small push so my page isn't sitting at zero. I want to find a service that helps with buying Instagram followers that act like real growth rather than random fake accounts.\n\nBefore I go ahead, I have a few specific worries I am hoping you guys can answer:\n\n* If I choose to buy followers on Instagram, is it going to look obvious to new visitors? I do not want to ruin my image before I even start.\n* Has anyone found a seller where the numbers are stable? I need to know how to get followers that actually stay and do not drop off after a few days.\n* Does having a higher count actually help convince real people to hit follow, or does it not make a difference?\n\nI am trying to figure out if this is the practical approach or if it is the wrong thing to do.\n\nI would love to hear from anyone who has tried something that actually worked to help a page grow safely and fast.\n\nAny suggestions are welcome and appreciated.",

The key for me was keeping the numbers realistic.  As for whether it makes a difference, honestly, yeah it helps. People are just more likely to follow a page that already looks alive. \n\nSo if you do go this route, stick with a slow, believable increase that fits your actual likes and views so nothing looks off to anyone checking your page.",

Get wasted spend, search term leaks, negative keyword gaps, bid strategy issues. Full diagnostic in 3 minutes.\n\n**2. Meta ads audit** \\- Paste account data or export. Get campaign structure issues, audience overlap, creative fatigue signals, scaling opportunities. Where to focus first.\n\n**3. Ad spend allocator** \\- Paste multi-channel spend + results. Get reallocation recommendations, diminishing returns flags, budget shift priorities.\n\n**4. A/B test analyzer** \\- Feed it test results. Get stat sig check, segment breakdowns, \"why it worked\" hypotheses, next test ideas.\n\n**5. Competitor teardown** \\- Paste a landing page URL. Get positioning analysis, messaging hierarchy, objection handling, CTA strategy. 2 hours of work in 3 minutes.\n\n**6. Landing page audit** \\- Upload screenshot or URL. Get headline clarity, CTA placement issues, trust signal gaps, mobile friction. Prioritized by impact.\n\n**7. UTM & tracking generator** \\- Describe campaign structure. Get consistent UTM taxonomy, GA4 event naming, conversion tracking specs. No more naming chaos.\n\n**8. Email sequence writer** \\- Give it ICP + offer + objections. Get full nurture sequence with subject lines, preview text, body copy. Maintains voice throughout.\n\n**9. Content repurposer** \\- Give it one long-form piece. Get LinkedIn posts, tweet threads, email snippets, ad hooks. Keeps your voice.\n\n**10. Programmatic SEO builder** \\- Give it niche + data source. Get page templates, title patterns, internal linking logic, schema markup. Scale without looking scaled.\n\n**Quick thoughts:**\n\n* Skills are markdown files. Upload in Claude settings → Features → Skills.\n* Build your own: document a workflow you repeat, add examples, save as .md\n* Community ones on GitHub, quality varies\n\nI use Ad spend allocator and A/B test analyzer weekly for client reporting. Competitor teardown whenever we're pitching or repositioning.\n\n",

      "text": "I'm pretty obsessed with email marketing recently, so I decided to spend the last month digging through email data from newsletter tools, ESPs, and my own experiments, and analyzed what gets people to actually open their emails.\n\nSome of this will piss off the \"best practices\" crowd. But the data doesn't lie.\n\nHere's what I found, ranked by worst to best:\n\n(I put a lot of effort into this post, so hope you find it valuable)\n\n**10. \"Newsletter\" in the subject line** \\- Instant death. People are drowning in newsletters. Calling yours a newsletter is like wearing a sign that says \"delete me.\" The worst? \"Monthly Newsletter - \\[Month\\].\" Please, just stop.\n\n**9. All caps + excessive punctuation** \\- \"LAST CHANCE!!!\" Screams desperation. Your audience isn't deaf, they're just ignoring you. Also spam filters absolutely hate this.\n\n**8. Generic promotional language** \\- \"Special offer inside\" or \"Exclusive deal for you.\" Everyone says it's exclusive. Nobody believes you anymore. These worked in 2019. It's 2026. Move on.\n\n**7. Overly clever/cryptic lines** \\- \"You won't believe what happened...\" Clickbait works on Facebook. Email audiences are smarter and more annoyed. They want value, not mystery.\n\n**6. Emoji-heavy subject lines** \\- Controversial take: emojis work, but MAX one per subject line. More than that and you look like a 14-year-old's text message. One well-placed emoji? Chef's kiss. Three fire emojis? Trash.\n\n**5. Question-based subject lines** \\- \"Are you making this mistake?\" Better than clickbait but still pretty meh. Works better in B2B than B2C. Needs to be hyper-specific to actually work.\n\n**4. Personalization (first name)** \\- \"Hey \\[Name\\], check this out.\" Works, but it's baseline now. Everyone does it. You're not special for using merge tags. Better than nothing though.\n\n**3. Time-sensitive + specific** \\- \"48 hours left: \\[specific thing\\].\" Creates urgency without being scammy. Key word: SPECIFIC. \"48 hours left\" alone doesn't work. Tell them what they're actually missing.\n\n**2. Ultra-specific value proposition** \\- \"How \\[Company\\] grew to $10M with email\". Pure value. Tell them exactly what's inside and why they should care. Funny thing - long subject lines (10-15 words) actually performed better here. All that \"keep it short\" advice? Not always true.\n\n**1. Plain, conversational, from a person** \\- \"Question for \\[name\\]\" or \"great business advice\" Why? It doesn't look like marketing. It looks like an email from a human. The best performing emails in my analysis looked like they came from a coworker, not a brand. Wild, right?\n\n**The stuff that actually matters:**\n\n* Shorter is NOT always better - 6-10 word subject lines performed best overall, but context matters way more than length\n* Mobile preview text is criminally underused - 70% of emails are opened on mobile. USE THAT SPACE.\n* Industry matters more than you think - What works in SaaS dies in e-commerce. Test your own audience.\n\nThe biggest lesson? Stop trying to \"hack\" opens. Write subject lines like you're emailing a friend. \n\nWhat's working for you? Genuinely curious what I'm missing here.",

Even just sticking within the US, it seems clients in the south have wildly different expectations from clients in the northeast or the PNW. It gets even more complicated when we add in having to get approvals from managers and clients. So, I'm wondering how everyone else is handling this as you scale.

Define what's non negotiable, core values, personality, key messages, versus what's flexible, word choice, cultural references, tone adjustments.\n\nDedicated brand team or steward reviews high visibility content, trains regional teams, provides feedback. Without ownership, consistency erodes.\n\nTemplates and approved messaging banks give teams starting points. Pre approved phrases reduce drift.\n\nTraining matters more than tools. Regular workshops with regional teams on brand voice, examples of good and bad, Q and A on edge cases.\n\nAI checks flag obvious deviations but aren't sophisticated enough for nuanced brand voice. Use for basic consistency, not final approval.\n\nManual review for important or client facing content is unavoidable. High stakes work gets human eyes from someone who understands the brand.\n\nApproval workflows slow things but ensure quality. Balance speed with risk, templates get less review, custom work gets more.\n\nOur clients scaling successfully centralize strategy and guidelines while decentralizing execution. Regional teams have autonomy within guardrails, escalate when unsure.\n\nUS regional differences are real but often overstated. Your brand voice should work everywhere with minor tweaks. If it requires total rewrites by region, core voice might be too narrow.\n\nFor international work, hire local copywriters who understand cultural context. Direct translation fails. Transcreation, adapting message while maintaining intent, works.\n\nFeedback loops where regional teams share what's working helps everyone learn. Monthly syncs reviewing examples and common mistakes.\n\nBigger you scale, more important onboarding and training become. New team members absorb brand voice through immersion, examples, practice, feedback, not just reading a guide.\n\nAccept some inconsistency is inevitable. Perfection doesn't scale. Keep core consistent, forgive minor variations at edges.\n\nInvest in brand stewardship as you grow. It's protecting one of your most valuable assets.",

Use the native integration if it exists. If not, use Zapier or Make with webhooks to send opens, clicks, unsubscribes, and bounces as activities, and increment a single Engagement Score field. Add UTM tags and a campaign ID to every link so the CRM can tie activity to the right campaign. Match on email plus a contact ID if you have one to avoid dupes. Do a one-time backfill, then switch to real time. We’ve done this for landscapers and turf shops and it’s smooth once naming and fields are set.

What I’d look for is automatic contact creation from forms, native email tracking, and simple automation rules like if no opens in 60 days then pause.

The tools don’t change. The psychology does.\n\nThat’s why beginners feel overwhelmed. They’re learning platforms instead of learning how decisions get made.\n\nOnce you understand pain, fear, mystery, and gain, SEO, ads, funnels, and analytics stop feeling random. They become different ways to deliver the same message.\n\nStart with one channel. One outcome. One real problem. Then layer the tools on top.\n\nThat’s how you avoid drowning in “everything marketing” and actually build skill.",

Once you’re tracking more than ~10–15 competitors, it becomes noisy, inconsistent, and time-consuming. The biggest issue for me wasn’t collecting emails — it was making sense of patterns over time (timing, frequency, offers, positioning).\n\nThat’s actually why I started building Inboxtic.io.\nIt’s still in MVP, but the core idea is to centralize competitor newsletters and analyze them longitudinally, not campaign by campaign.\n\nRight now we’re:\n\t•\tBuying & aggregating newsletters at scale (so no inbox clutter)\n\t•\tStructuring metadata (brand, industry, timing, promo type)\n\t•\tUsing AI to surface patterns/anomalies instead of manual tagging\n\nI still think DIY setups make sense at very small scale or for niche research.\nBut once you want repeatable competitive insight, automation is the only way it doesn’t become a weekly time sink.\n\nAlso interesting to see you built Newsletrix — clearly a lot of us hit the same wall. Feels like this space is just getting started.\n\nWould love to compare notes on what signals you’ve found most useful (timing vs offer vs copy vs frequency).",

I've been seeing fraud-blocker come up a lot lately for PPC teams dealing with this exact issue.\n\nIt automatically filters out fake clicks and junk leads so you're not wasting time investigating drops that are just from bad traffic inflating your numbers. Might help you rule out that variable at least before you go down teh rabbit hole with product and data teams. For the system of record question, I'd recommend setting up a simple shared doc or notion page where any team logs changes that could impact metrics.\n\nDoesn't need to be fancy, just a timestamped log everyone agrees to update.",

They follow situations, people, or something that feels like it’s happening right now. When posts lean too much into updates or announcements, engagement usually drops, even if the mission itself matters.\n\nContent often works better when it starts small. A moment, a question, or a short explanation of something most people don’t realize about the issue. Real people help too. Volunteers, staff, or even voiceovers paired with simple footage usually land better than graphics or logos.\n\nX can be frustrating for this kind of goal. Discovery there is limited, especially for awareness. TikTok or Reels tend to give more room for reach, even with imperfect posts.\n\nConsistency usually matters more than polish. A few human-feeling posts each week often outperform something that sounds official but rarely shows up.\n\nWhat kind of posts have gone out so far?",

I’m trying to understand why some sites get picked at all.*\n\nFew things I started trying in order to clear this up internally.\n\n**1. Separate selection from clicks**\n\nClicks are how humans behave.\n\nAI visibility is about getting cited.\n\nWhat are the main features/solutions of your business? Ask google and AI questions about that.\n\nPick queries where you show up in Google, but AI answers keep naming competitors and not you.\n\nIf that's happening, the model is choosing others during the retrieval phase. Ranking isn't where the focus should be, it's now about how your content is being extracted.\n\n**2. Compare rankings against AI citations**\n\nBuild a small set of queries where you are consistently top 5 on Google.\n\nEach week:\n\n* Ask the same questions in a few AI tools\n* Note which brands or products get mentioned\n* Ignore phrasing, just track presence\n\nIf your rankings stay the same but AI mentions start to drift, the issue is structural, not copy quality.\n\n**3. Watch for early signals**\n\nLook at the AI answers over time. These tend to show up first:\n\n* Pricing stops being named and turns into “varies” or disappears entirely\n* Different plans or variants merged into one generic option\n* Eligibility rules you clearly state never show up\n* A competitor framed as the default option\n\nAny of the above being present, means there are extraction problems.  \nThe system could not reliably pull the details from your website.\n\n**4. Fix the systems that are struggling, not the messaging**\n\n* Pages that render cleanly and fast\n* Clear resolution paths without JS-only disclosure or interaction gates\n* Explicit facts that survive truncation\n* Simple, machine readable structure\n\nTBH I didn't want to waste time creating more content, or reworking the messaging.\n\nThe move in traffic will happen down the road.  \nOnly looking at clicks is reacting after the damage is done.  \nRight now it just feels like citation comes before traffic, and we’re only set up to see the second part.\n\n\n\n**Please share how you guys have been reconciling traffic with visibility.**",

Build custom audiences from IG engagers and video viewers up to 365 days, and site visitors if you have a pixel, then make 1 to 3% lookalikes. Exclude past buyers.\n\nTo spy, use the Meta Ad Library for “makeup brush cleaner” brands and note the hooks, angles, and formats, not keywords. Short UGC that shows the gross water and a quick before/after tends to work. I’m more in outdoor services, but the same playbook applies.

Thought I’d share what we learned since I couldn’t find much practical info when we started.  \n**What didn’t work for us:**\n\n* Tracked links in captions/comments - complete dead end since Instagram disables clickable links on mobile\n* Trying to query the Instagram API for new followers after posts - there’s no official endpoint for this (as of Jan 2026), and scraping workarounds are risky if you’re managing client accounts\n\n**What actually worked:**\n\n* Tracked links in Stories, with posts/reels directing people to the story\n* Link-in-bio attribution tied to specific posts\n\nThe frustrating thing is Instagram deliberately makes this hard because they want you using paid ads for proper attribution. And “brand traffic” metrics that agencies use require enterprise-scale resources most smaller teams don’t have.  \nI wrote up our full breakdown including the specific approaches we tested on our Hacking Growth Substack.  \n  \nFull disclosure: I’m the founder of Leo AI, and we ended up building some of this into our platform. But the methods themselves work regardless of what tools you use - happy to answer questions about the approach itself.  \nHas anyone found other reliable methods? Curious what’s worked for others.",
