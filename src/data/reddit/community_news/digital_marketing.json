And I can hardly recall using the same strategy for more than 2 clients. Each one has their own flair, their own style or a “human touch” as i like to say that makes their marketing unique. Sure there are now tools like Blobr AI, LocalQ or Ryze AI that can automate reports but to say that they can replace our work is downplaying our role, undermining our experiences. How does AI train itself? By regurgitating information that humans have already done in the past. Hypothetically, if humans were to be replaced, there would come a point where AI wouldn’t be able to offer any sort of new or beneficial suggestions. And who would come to its aid then? So, the next time anyone says that marketing is going to be majorly automated, do enlighten them :)",

However, AI IS going to lead to a reduction in the digital marketing and programming workforce - industry wide.  But I think it will impact major corporations more than small shops and I actually see AI a major advantage for small agencies like mine.  \n\nWith its current capabilities, AI does more to increase the capacity and output of a competent marketer or programmer.  This likely results in fewer people needed industry wide. \n\nI think it will also lead to new opportunities and perhaps spinoff industries.  \n\nThe role of my employees and their daily activities will probably change significantly over the next few years.  I am optimistic that it will be an improvement for everyone.  We will do better, more thorough work with the help of AI.  We can spend more time on marketing strategy, a little less time on implementation and a lot less time on observation and reporting.\n\nBut there are definitely new threats to my business.

The marketers I see struggling are the ones who were basically doing what AI does - cranking out generic blog posts, writing cookie-cutter ad copy, building templated strategies. Yeah, AI can do that now.\n\n\n\nBut the ones who actually understand their client's business, who can read between the lines of data and say \"here's why this campaign flopped even though the numbers look fine on paper\" - AI isn't touching that.\n\n\n\nWhat I've noticed is that AI is actually making good marketers even better. I use it to handle the grunt work (first drafts, data organization, brainstorming) which frees me up to spend more time on strategy and client relationships. That's where the real value is.\n\n\n\nThe human touch thing you mentioned is spot on. Every client has a different voice, different audience, different goals. AI can approximate that but it can't truly understand the nuances. I had a client in a very niche B2B space and every AI-generated piece sounded like it was written for a generic SaaS company. The industry-specific knowledge and tone just wasn't there.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, AI is a tool upgrade not a replacement. The people worried about it are probably the ones who need to level up their actual skills.",

They teach you how traffic actually works, what keywords bring visitors, and what pages perform. Most beginners skip this and operate blindly.\n\nSecond, a basic keyword research tool like Ubersuggest, Ahrefs (if budget allows), or even Google Keyword Planner. Understanding search intent and keyword demand is foundational for SEO and content marketing.\n\nThird, a simple content and design tool like Canva. You don't need Photoshop in the beginning - Canva is more than enough for social posts, thumbnails, and basic creatives.\n\nFourth, an email marketing tool (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.). Even if your list is small, learning how to build and nurture an audience early is powerful.\n\nAnd finally, a social scheduling tool (like Buffer or Meta Business Suite) to stay consistent without burning out.\n\nBeginners often think advanced tools equal better marketing. In reality, mastering a small stack deeply is far more valuable than juggling everything. What helped me most early on was understanding analytics and search intent - everything else builds on that.",

I'd suggest this order for you specifically:\n\nStart with Google Analytics and Search Console, so you understand how traffic and performance work. Then learn basic SEO and keyword research, because that's what connects content to visibility. After that, explore paid ads (Meta and Google Ads) since your creative background will help you massively there. Good creatives often outperform average ones even with the same targeting.\n\nAs for courses, you don't need anything overly expensive at the beginning. Solid options:\n\n* Google's free Digital Marketing & E-commerce Certificate\n* HubSpot's free marketing certifications\n* Meta Blueprint (for paid social)\n\nThose give you structured fundamentals without heavy investment. But here's something important: alongside courses, try applying it immediately. Maybe offer to handle SEO or social strategy for one of your current clients at a small fee or as a test case. Practical experience will teach you faster than theory alone.",

If you don't know this, nothing else makes sense.\n\n\n\n2. Pick ONE channel and go deep. Don't try SEO + Ads + Social simultaneously. You'll be mediocre at everything. I'd pick SEO because it compounds and actually teaches you how marketing works (keyword intent, conversion paths, content strategy).\n\n\n\n3. After 3 months with #1 and #2, then add a design tool (Canva) and an email tool. Not before.\n\n\n\nThe problem with the \"full stack\" approach is beginners get distracted. They spend 2 hours in Figma, 2 hours in Mailchimp, 2 hours trying to set up a CRM, and never actually execute the one thing that would move the needle.\n\n\n\nTools don't matter.

While AI algorithms are opaque, the inputs they rely on are actually very clear.\n\nHere is how we explain (and sell) \"Local GEO\" vs. \"Local SEO\":\n\n1. The Shift from \"Proximity\" to \"Sentiment\"\n\nLocal SEO (Google Maps): Cares about where the user is standing (Proximity).\n\nLocal GEO (ChatGPT/Perplexity): Cares about what people are saying.\n\nActionable Step: We optimize reviews not just for stars, but for keywords. If a client wants to rank for \"Best Emergency Dentist,\" we encourage reviews that specifically mention \"saved me in an emergency.\" LLMs read this semantic context and serve it as an answer.\n\n2. Data Consensus (The Trust Signal)\n\nLLMs hallucinate, so they crave verification. If your client's NAP (Name, Address, Phone) varies across Yelp, Apple Maps, and Bing, the AI lowers its \"Confidence Score\" and won't recommend them.\n\nOur pitch: \"We sanitize your data so the AI trusts you enough to recommend you.\"\n\n3. The \"Best Of\" Ecosystem\n\nWhen you ask ChatGPT for a recommendation, it often synthesizes answers from top-ranking blog posts like \"Top 10 Dentists in Austin.\"\n\nStrategy: Getting your client mentioned in these local \"listicles\" is essentially the new backlink strategy for AI.\n\nSo no, don't tell them it's unknown. Tell them you are optimizing their \"Digital Trust Footprint\" so AI models feel safe recommending them.\n\nHope this helps frame it for your agency!",

      "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm looking for the best site to buy Instagram followers for my profile. There are many sites which are claiming to provide real growth, but I’m not sure which actually works. I’ve never bought followers and before actually trying this service, I want to hear from people who have experience with such sites. \n\nSo far, I've tried to make my profile stand out by adding a high-resolution profile picture, a well-written bio, and pinning my best posts to the top. Im also using hashtags related to my niche and appealing captions with each post. But still, the organic growth is slower than I thought. \n\nThat's why I'm looking for a reputable and working platform that offers the best service for buying followers. Every other site says they offer real followers, their service is safe and it helps to increase organic growth of an Instagram profile. But its hard to know which actually provide best results. \n\nBefore trying anything, I want to understand the real impact from people who have tested these services. \n\nFor those who have bought followers before: \n\n● Did the followers look like real people with posts and activity? \n\n● Did they interact with your content at all, or just increase the number? \n\n● Did your reach, impressions, or engagement change after buying? \n\n● Did it help attract real followers later, or did growth slow down? \n\n● Did you notice any issues with the algorithm, shadow bans, or reduced visibility? \n\n● Did these Instagram followers drop over time, and were they replaced? \n\n● How was customer support if something went wrong? \n\n● In hindsight, was it worth the money?\n\nMy main goal isn't to increase numbers only. I want to build real credibility, maintain healthy engagement, and grow without risking my Instagram account. I'm especially interested in whether buying followers can ever support organic growth or hurt it.\n\nI'm not looking for promotions or affiliate links, only honest experiences, good or bad, from people who have tried it.\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your experiences.",

          "text": "Honest advice: don't do it. You mentioned your main goal is to build real credibility, but buying followers is actually rather a quick way to destroy it.\n\nFrom a data perspective, the Instagram algorithm heavily favors Engagement Rate (Engagement / Total Followers). If you buy 5,000 followers, they will be inactive bots. When you post that high-quality content you mentioned, your new \"followers\" won't interact with it. This crashes your engagement rate.\n\nYou may even get shadow-banned and see your profile get hurt even more.\n\nWhen the algorithm sees a large account with near-zero engagement, it signals that the content is irrelevant or low-quality. The result? It actually stops showing your posts to the real organic followers you already have. You essentially pay to get \"shadow-banned\" by the math.\n\nSince you are already creating good content, I suggest to take the budget and put it into a legitimate Engagement or Traffic objective ad campaign. Boost your top-performing organic post to get you in front of audiences who are actually interested in your niche. That is how you build authority that sticks.\n\nBuying followers is almost always a negative ROI play long-term.",

People love short-form inspiration. I’m currently at $140 in ad-share and a small affiliate deal. Not \"quit your job\" money, but it’s growing.\nThe \"Stack\" (All have free tiers):\nScripting: ChatGPT. Tip: Ask it to write in a specific author's style to avoid that \"robotic\" feel.\nVoiceover: ElevenLabs. It sounds human enough to keep people watching.\nVisuals: Leonardo.ai for images and Pexels for stock footage.\nEditing: CapCut. The \"Auto-Captions\" are a non-negotiable for mobile.\nMy 3 Big Takeaways:\nRetention is everything. If your first 3 seconds don't hook them, the algorithm kills the video.\nInstagram and TikTok are search engines now. I started ranking higher once I put keywords in my \"Name\" field (e.g., \"Daily Wisdom | Stoic Motivation\").\nThe \"Quality\" Trap. Don't spend 5 hours on one video. Spend 30 minutes. Volume \"trains\" the algorithm on who your audience is.\nI’m not selling anything and I'm not here to share links. Just wanted to post some real-world data because I’m tired of the \"passive income\" lies.\nWhat are you guys currently using to automate your workflow?

      "text": "For years, the rule was simple: rank higher, get more traffic, win. But AI Overviews are changing what winning looks like. Users can get a product recommendation, a short comparison, even pros and cons without clicking anything.\n\n*So, if your brand is present inside AI answers, is traffic still the main KPI, or is it becoming a vanity metric?*\n\nWe ran a study to understand how much influence review platforms still have in AI Overviews, especially for commercial queries where people are choosing software or services. The results look like a paradox:\n\nReview platforms show up in roughly every third AI Overview. Specifically, 34.5% of AI Overviews cited at least one review platform. \n\nThat means most AI answers still come from somewhere else. And yet, when review platforms do appear, Google often includes more than one in the same answer. In AI Overviews that include review sites, we saw an average of 2.28 review-platform links per response. It’s like the system prefers to present a comparison view instead of one single source.\n\n*Even more interesting:* the words people use in the query change everything. If the query clearly asks for reviews or ratings, review platforms appear far more often. If the query is more like best or top, review platforms show up much less. \n\nThat’s counterintuitive for anyone who assumed best tools queries would naturally lean on G2/Capterra-style sources.\n\nEven the platforms that dominate AI citations still lost most of their organic traffic between early 2024 and the end of 2025. The declines in our dataset ranged from 76.5% to 92.2%. In plain terms, being heavily cited by AI did not protect them from losing clicks:\n\n* Review platforms appear in 34.5% of AI Overviews\n* Query wording impact: review/rating queries 49%, software/tools queries 39.4%, best/top queries 17.1%\n* The top five platforms account for 88% of all review-platform links in AI Overviews (Gartner Peer Insights, G2, Capterra, Software Advice, TrustRadius)\n* Organic traffic declines for the most cited platforms ranged from 76.5% to 92.2% from early 2024 to end of 2025\n* When review platforms appear, AI Overviews often include multiple: 2.28 review links per response on average\n\nSo what are we supposed to optimize for now?\n\nIf AI can borrow your credibility and your structure to answer the query directly, traffic may drop even while influence stays high. That shifts the game from visits to visibility inside the answer layer.\n\nWe’d love your take: Is traffic still the goal, or is the new goal to be included and trusted inside AI answers, even if the click never happens? And if you agree, what metrics are you using to prove value to stakeholders?",

Google has a list. Everyone who's bought from them gets hit in the same wave.\n\n**Keyword stuffing in 2026** — Sounds obvious but I still see agencies doing it with synonyms. \"Our *email marketing platform* is the best *email marketing solution* for *email marketing campaigns*...\" Google reads that as spam because it IS spam.\n\nThe boring truth: create genuinely useful content, build real relationships for links, and be patient.

Or worse getting pulled into \"quick calls\" that turned into 45-minute therapy sessions about why their competitor is ranking higher.\n\nThe change: I started sending every client a short async update every Friday. Just 4-5 lines max.\n\n* What we did this week\n* What's in progress\n* Any blockers or things I need from them\n* What's coming next week\n\nThat's it. No fancy dashboard. No Loom video. Just a few lines in WhatsApp or email wherever they prefer.\n\nThe result? Monday inbox chaos dropped by like 70%. Clients stopped \"checking in\" because they already knew what was happening. And the ones who still wanted calls? At least now the calls had context.\n\nSounds basic, but I resisted this for years thinking \"I'll just update them when there's something big to share.\" Turns out clients don't want big updates. They want to feel like things are moving.\n\nAnyone else have a small process change that had an outsized impact on client relationships?",

Scheduling goes through a simple scheduler or even native platform scheduling. Analytics lives in a basic dashboard or spreadsheet tracking what performed.\n\nTotal cost went from $100+ per month down to about $20-30, and the workflow is actually faster because there is less UI to navigate between steps.\n\nThe real insight is that the all-in-one tools are optimized for teams of 10+ where handoffs between people matter.

If you spend more time exporting/importing than thinking, it’s not simplifying anything.\n* Defining “done” for each stage this was the game changer. When a topic hits ready for draft, what inputs are really required? When something goes live, what one metric actually matters? Once you define those, half the features in most clouds become noise.\n\nFor us, that looked like:\n\n* lighter planning in something simple calendar + shared doc\n* research either manual or scoped to what matters for that topic\n* writing in the simplest editor that gets version history\n* posting via scheduler\n* a quick post-mortem list what worked, what didn’t\n\nIn one project we also tested visibility layers like SyndrAI not because it replaced tools, but because it made clear what wasn’t being tracked. That clarity alone cut down how much we felt like we needed the next thing.\n\n",

All I really wanted was a defined pipeline, but everything was super messy, everything felt like bloat.\n\nAfter trying way too many stacks, I stopped looking for the perfect tool and just built a small system around ChatGPT instead.\n\nIt sounds very complicated, but it wasn’t some huge coding project. I basically built a lightweight script that orchestrates prompts: it takes a topic + keywords, generates an outline, runs structured research prompts, writes a draft section by section, and exports a clean article. Most of it was copy/paste + tweaking code with ChatGPT/Copilot. Took around 3 days total.\n\nNow my workflow is pretty tight:\n\n• I generate a 3-month content strategy in one sitting with ChatGPT/Perplexity (12–16 articles)  \n• Quick manual keyword research per article (5–10 min)  \n• Feed the topic + keywords into my script, which runs a prompt pipeline (outline → research → draft) in the background  \n• 4–6 minutes later I have a structured draft  \n• I spend \\~15 minutes editing and polishing\n\nThe biggest win isn’t just speed (though it cut my production time by around 70%). It’s control. I’ve standardized client profiles, brand voice prompts, and article configs, so every piece of content is consistent and easy to tweak. The best part: I’m not locked into a $100+/month platform I barely use!\n\nAt this point I honestly think a simple custom workflow + AI beats most all-in-one marketing suites unless you need heavy team features...\n\nCurious if anyone else ended up building their own lightweight system instead of stacking tools. If anyone’s curious about mine, I’m happy to break down how I structured the prompt pipeline, it’s surprisingly simple once you see it laid out.",

          "text": "Not a dumb question at all, most ecom brands completely ignore post purchase and leave stupid amounts of money on the table. It's one of the highest leverage things you can do because the hardest and most expensive part, getting someone to trust you enough to buy, is already done.\n\nThe math is pretty simple. Acquiring a new customer costs whatever your CAC is. Getting an existing buyer to purchase again costs almost nothing by comparison. Even small improvements in post purchase conversion rates have an outsized impact on overall profitability because there's virtually no additional acquisition cost eating into the margin.\n\nWhat actually works in practice from what we've seen with our clients. Post purchase upsell offers immediately after checkout convert anywhere from 5 to 15% depending on the offer relevance and discount. That's essentially free revenue on transactions that already happened. Retention email flows triggered by purchase behavior, not just generic \"thanks for buying\" sequences but actually intelligent flows based on what they bought, when they're likely to need a refill or complementary product, and their browsing behavior after purchase. Those consistently outperform broadcast campaigns by a wide margin.\n\nThe tools in this space have gotten way better. Cleverific is fine for Shopify focused post purchase offers but honestly the real gains come from building out the full retention system, not just slapping an upsell widget on the thank you page. The widget alone is a nice bump but it's like 20% of the actual opportunity.\n\nWhere most people screw this up is treating PRO as a one time setup and forgetting about it. The brands crushing it are testing different post purchase offers constantly, segmenting by first time vs repeat buyers, adjusting timing on follow up flows based on actual repurchase data, and tracking contribution margin on repeat purchases separately from new customer acquisition.\n\nThe biggest thing nobody talks about is that strong post purchase optimization actually makes your paid acquisition more aggressive because your LTV goes up. If you know a customer is worth $150 over 6 months instead of just their first $50 order, you can afford a higher CAC and outbid competitors who are only optimizing for first purchase ROAS. That's the real compounding effect.",

      "text": "**THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY LONG but it is worth your time**  \n  \nIf you run an agency and you're not treating Instagram as a lead generation system , you're behind.\n\nI spent some time pulling this apart. Here's everything I found.\n\n**First — the numbers that made me take this seriously**\n\n2 billion monthly users. 33 minutes of daily average scroll time. 61% of users actively research products and services on the platform — including enterprise buyers and B2B decision makers.\n\nFor agencies specifically: Reels get a **3.2% engagement rate** vs 1.1% for static posts. They drive **41% higher click-through rates** to your website. Your potential clients are scrolling right now. The question is whether your agency shows up when they do.\n\n**What's actually dead in 2026 (stop doing this)**\n\n* Single-message DM blasts with no follow-up\n* Generic \"thanks for following!\" auto-replies\n* Link-only messages with zero conversation\n* Bulk follow/unfollow tools (these will get you banned — more on this below)\n* Posting without any keyword or SEO strategy on the profile\n* Treating every lead the same regardless of intent signals\n\nInstagram's spam detection has gotten significantly smarter. Meta's API keeps tightening. The shortcuts that worked in 2022 are now account-suspension risks.\n\nWhat replaced them is more interesting.\n\n**Stage 1: AI Content at Scale (the table stakes layer)**\n\nAI tools have made content production genuinely fast now. Not \"decent for AI\" fast. Actually fast.\n\n**What AI handles:**\n\n* Caption and hashtag generation tailored to your niche and audience\n* Optimal posting time recommendations based on your audience's behavior patterns\n* Video editing for Reels — automated cuts, captions, transitions\n* Content variations for different audience segments\n\nTools that are actually good right now: **Zebracat** and **InVideo AI** for Reels, **Canva AI** and **Adobe Express** for carousels and graphics, **CapCut AI** for quick video editing, **Flick** and **SocialBee** for scheduling + caption strategy, **Planable** and **Ritetag** for caption and hashtag optimization.\n\n*The important caveat: AI handles execution. You still need to provide the strategic direction, the brand voice, the insight. Agencies that fully automate content sound robotic and lose trust fast. The ones winning use AI to execute faster while humans drive the narrative.*\n\n**Stage 2: Instagram SEO (the thing almost nobody does)**\n\nInstagram has a real search function now. People type in problems, services, and topics the same way they use Google. If your profile isn't optimized for this, you're invisible to an entire discovery channel.\n\n**What actually moves the needle:**\n\n**Keyword-optimized bio** — Don't write a clever bio. Write a clear one. \"Shopify web design agency for DTC brands\" will outperform \"we build digital dreams\" every single time. **Tools like Flick can audit and rewrite your bio for searchability.**\n\n**Descriptive captions** — Captions that naturally include terms your clients search for (\"email marketing for SaaS companies,\" \"web development agency for startups\") get surfaced in search. **Ritetag helps you build these without sounding forced.**\n\n**Hashtag strategy** — Not 30 random hashtags. A deliberate mix of trending, niche, and branded tags. You can use Ritetag \n\n**Alt text on every image** — This is skipped by 95% of accounts. Adding descriptive alt text improves both accessibility and Instagram's ability to categorize and surface your content. Takes 30 seconds per post.\n\n**Stage 3: DM Automation — the old way is dead**\n\nHere's where things get interesting.\n\nMost agencies doing DM automation are running the 2021 playbook:\n\n>\n\nThat's not automation. That's a vending machine. And it converts like one.\n\nWhat the better agencies figured out is that the DM is not a delivery mechanism — **it's a qualification conversation.**\n\nThe new approach looks like this:\n\n>\n\nNotice what just happened. Multiple touchpoints. The lead got qualified (experience level). Multiple pieces of value were delivered. An email was captured — naturally, inside the conversation, without a form.\n\n**Why this outperforms the old way:**\n\n* Multiple touchpoints = stronger relationship before any sales conversation\n* You know the lead's context before your team talks to them\n* Email captured inside the conversation feels helpful, not transactional\n* Relationship-driven sequences convert significantly higher than one-shot blasts\n\nThe tools running this: **ManyChat** (most powerful, most flexible), **CreatorFlow** (built specifically for conversation flows), **Jotform Instagram Agent** (great for combining DM automation with data capture).\n\n**Stage 4: AI Message Variation (why your bot sounds like a bot)**\n\nHere's a small thing with a big impact.\n\nIf everyone who triggers your DM automation gets the exact same message — word for word, every time — two things happen. Instagram's spam detection flags the pattern. And people can tell it's automated, which kills trust.\n\nThe fix is AI message variation. Instead of one static response, AI generates multiple versions that rotate automatically:\n\nRather than *\"Hey! Here's the link you requested: \\[URL\\]\"* — identical every time — the system rotates:\n\n* *\"Hey \\[Name\\]! Here's that link: \\[URL\\]\"*\n* *\"Here you go! \\[URL\\] — let me know if you have questions\"*\n* *\"Got you! Here's the link: \\[URL\\]\"*\n* *\"Link incoming! \\[URL\\]\"*\n\nSame message. Four different phrasings. Feels human. Avoids detection. Takes about 10 minutes to set up inside ManyChat's advanced settings.\n\n**Stage 5: Story Reply Automation — the most underused channel right now**\n\nEveryone is automating comment replies. Almost nobody is automating story replies.\n\nThat's your gap.\n\nStory replies convert better than comment triggers for three reasons:\n\n1. **Higher intent** — they actively chose to respond to your story, not just scroll past\n2. **More intimate** — stories feel personal, not broadcast\n3. **Almost zero competition** — barely any brands are automating this\n\nSetup is simple: keyword trigger on story replies → automated DM with relevant content.\n\n**Real example:**\n\n>\n\n**Story automation ideas that work:**\n\n* Product mention story → trigger \"INFO\" → auto-DM with product details and link\n* Behind-the-scenes story → trigger \"HOW\" → DM with process breakdown\n* Launch announcement → trigger \"NOTIFY\" → add to waitlist with confirmation\n* Tutorial teaser → trigger \"FULL\" → send the complete tutorial link\n\nHigh intent, personal channel, almost no competition. This is the easiest win most agencies aren't taking.\n\n**Stage 6: The Multi-Touch Nurture Sequence**\n\nThe most effective DM automation in 2026 isn't one message. It's a timed sequence.\n\nThe framework that works:\n\n* **Touch 1 (immediate):** Deliver the requested value. Link, guide, resource — whatever they asked for. Add one specific tip about what to look at first.\n* **Touch 2 (12–24 hours):** Check in. Surface the one thing inside the content they're most likely to miss. Keep it genuinely helpful.\n* **Touch 3 (48–72 hours):** Ask a genuine question about their situation. Soft pitch only if it's relevant. This is where intent signals start surfacing.\n* **Touch 4 (5–7 days):** Final touchpoint. Leave the door open. Don't pressure. Give them an easy way to re-engage if the timing wasn't right.\n\n**The principle behind all of it:** every message should either deliver new value or ask a real question. If you can't answer \"why would this person want this message?\" — don't send it.\n\nSequences that feel helpful get responses. Sequences that feel like sales funnels get blocked.\n\n**The compliance layer (non-negotiable)**\n\nThis whole thing falls apart if your account gets restricted.\n\nOnly use tools that operate within Meta's **official API**. This means:\n\n* ✅ ManyChat, Jotform Instagram Agent, CreatorFlow\n* ✅ Hootsuite, Sprout Social, SocialBee, Flick, Ritetag\n* ❌ Anything promising bulk follows, automated likes, or mass DM blasts\n\nThose \"growth tools\" that promise fast follower counts violate Instagram's Terms of Service. They lead to shadowbans or permanent account restrictions. You'll lose the entire pipeline you built.\n\nEvery tool I've mentioned operates within API-safe practices. When evaluating anything new ,  that's the first question to ask.\n\nI put together a two-edition breakdown in my newsletter ( mentioned in comments ) covering the complete funnel stack — stages 6 and 7 in full detail, the DM-to-email pipeline with ESP integration options, AI lead scoring tools and how to set them up, reputation monitoring AI, Meta's native AI ad tools (Advantage+, Opportunity Score, Advantage+ Creative), and a step-by-step build order so you know exactly what to set up first for **AGENCIES . The first edition will be released tomorrow**\n\nIf you have questions on anything in stages 1–5, drop them below. Happy to go deep on any of it.",

I also love old Euro cars and have 2K followers on a car IG where I feature my cars, do some film photography, and have weirdly specific knowledge/travel exp in the former Soviet Union. Studied abroad there.\n\n**The options I'm debating:**\n\n1. **Career services** (resume reviews, LinkedIn optimization) - feels like easiest money since people already ask me for this, but I do have a day job and don't want there to be any intersect (don't want my boss seeing me push career content on LinkedIn)\n2. **YouTube channel** on travel to strange places like Eastern Europe, former Soviet Union, etc. (like Bald and Bankrupt style)\n3. **Affiliate marketing/paid ads** for things I like such as tech and gadgets that I already spend A TON of research on before buying them\n4. **Food content** on social media (friends always come to me to find the best food)\n\n**My hesitation:** Career services feels too \"job-like.\" Travel content sounds fun but seems like a long game. Affiliate marketing feels spammy? Food content is oversaturated?\n\n**What would you pick if you were me and had at least 4 hours a week to dedicate to this?**\n\nThanks in advance!",

Life's too short for affiliate marketing, food is overcrowded (could be part of your travel stuff), and as you said, you don't want your boss to see you push career content on LinkedIn so that's not exactly an option. \n\nI give career advice too, although my resume doesn't look as good as yours. It's not easy to monetise it, imho.\n\nHave a discussion with your boss if it's OK to build something on the side for fun if you get along with him.

That’s a signal, not a theory. You don’t have to turn it into “thought leader on LinkedIn.” You could keep it low profile and productize it quietly, structured resume audits, mock interviews, maybe a small paid workshop off platform. No public posting required.\n\nTravel and food are both long games. They reward consistency and volume. Four hours a week is tough unless you genuinely love the process enough to do it for years with minimal return early on.\n\nAffiliate is viable, but only if you enjoy the media side, writing, SEO, or video. Otherwise, it becomes another research rabbit hole with no distribution engine.\n\nIf it were me, I’d run a 30 day validation sprint on career services. Cap it at 10 paid sessions. Track time spent, energy, and conversion rate. Worst case, you make some side cash and learn you hate it. Best case, you have proven demand without guessing.\n\nFun projects are great.

We follow a few simple rules now and have Pmax campaigns that can run on autopilot. I only have to check them once or twice a quarter.\n\nIf it doesn't have at least 100 conversions over a 30 day period, Pmax will have a lot of trouble. Not always, but most of the time it fails after 2-3 months. Have a campign with 300 conversions a month? You can only divide into 3 campaigns max before performance starts to suffer, and that's if conversions are spread evenly over all skus which is never the case.\n\nIf your product feeds are not completely automated yet, don't even bother with Pmax. Merchant center should be updated every few hours, minimum. Best practice is to send an update via Merchant Center API anytime your product data changes on your website. Even once a day isn't enough anymore, products flickering between approved/disapproved because your website updates before Merchant Center will kill performance.\n\nThere isn't much strategy to Pmax outside of dividing products into campigns that make sense. Products with similar margins should be grouped together in campaigns to take advantage of lower ROAS targets for high margin products while protecting run away spend for low margin items.\n\nOverall, good Google Ads performance has become less about marketing and more about plumbing. At least when it comes to product ads. Also, I've never found an off the shelf solution that actually works well. Our IT dept handles the automation, it's almost impossible to do without at least 1 programmer on staff. And no, vibe coders don't count lol.",

Most failed because they underestimated how much of marketing is relationship management, context-switching between client problems, and just knowing that this particular industry has weird compliance rules that no training data captures.\n\nWhere I’d actually worry is the junior positions.

But the mid-level and senior work - campaign architecture, attribution modeling, client communication - that actually gets more valuable because AI handles the grunt work and frees you up for the strategic layer.\n\nBest move right now is exactly what you said: get insanely good at using AI as a power tool. The gap between someone who can prompt well and someone who can’t is already bigger than the gap between junior and senior was 5 years ago.",

Nobody is trying to overcharge you, but it ironically takes about the same amount of time to optimize an ad spend of $1k/month as it does $100k a month. And sometimes the $1k/month is harder to manage because you have no room for testing, experimentation, or risks/error, and it takes a long time to go through the cycle of test-->deploy-->measure, since your ads are reaching so few people and it might take days to know if your change really did anything useful.\n\nAnd from an ad management perspective, it's really hard to add sufficient value while also making it worth your time to manage it at all. If the ad spend is $1k and my fee is $1k, I have to at least double the effectiveness of your ads to make it worthwhile (while also not spending so much time on it that the $1k isn't worthwile. That's hard. Or in other words, if you didn't actively manage it, you could afford for it to perform twice as bad and the ROI would be the same.\n\nThat said, outsourcing here might be perfect. $1k goes a lot further in other areas of the world, and may get you someone with a lot more skill who is willing to spend a lot more time to optimize it correctly . Vet them very carefully of course - they can cause you a lot of problems too - but overall it might fit better for the scale you need.",

Here's why.\n\nThe person running your ads still has to spend time on creative, testing audiences, managing the campaigns daily, and dealing with Meta's constant platform changes. That's real labor regardless of whether leads come in week one or week three. Good media buyers know their time has value and they've been burned by performance-only deals where the business owner ghosts them after a slow first month.\n\nThat said, $800-$1500/month for ad management alone isn't crazy for someone competent. The issue is what you're getting for that money. A lot of agencies charge those rates and then run cookie-cutter campaigns with zero strategy customization.\n\nWhat I've seen work well for local service businesses like lawn care is a hybrid model. Something like a smaller base retainer ($400-500/month) plus a per-lead bonus. That way the marketer has skin in the game but isn't working for free during the ramp-up period. It also filters out the agencies who don't actually believe in their own results because they'll refuse the bonus structure.\n\nFor lawn care specifically, your cost per lead on Meta should land somewhere around $15-35 depending on your market. If someone is quoting you management fees but can't tell you what CPL to expect in your area, that's a red flag. Ask them about their experience with service-area businesses and what kind of lead volume they've driven before. The good ones will have numbers ready.",

But the structure you’re proposing is why experienced operators won’t take the deal.\n\nIf you pay on percentage of closed jobs, the agency is carrying all the upfront labor while having no control over your response time, quoting process, close rate, or upsells. They control traffic and leads. You control revenue conversion. Tying their pay to your sales execution is a risk most seasoned agencies won’t accept.\n\nWhen you add required video production, you’re asking them to concept, shoot, edit, test, set up campaigns, configure tracking, and optimize before earning a dollar. That’s real labor and real cost. In effect, you’re asking another business to fund your growth with their time and expertise as an interest-free operational loan. Established operators don’t finance client businesses that way.\n\nAlso, “per lead” in lawn care is rarely clean. Some leads price shop. Some don’t answer. Some ghost after quotes. Who decides what counts? Those disputes are common in performance-only models.\n\nAs for the $800–$1,500 quotes, that’s not astronomical for Meta management. It covers strategy, creative testing, tracking setup, optimization, and reporting. The real money at risk isn’t the management fee. It’s your ad spend if campaigns are poorly structured\n\nHiring inexperienced people might feel cheaper, but if they haven’t managed real budgets over multiple months and corrected underperforming campaigns, you’re paying for their learning curve.\n\nIf you want serious talent, expect a monthly management fee plus ad budget and a defined testing window. If you insist on performance-only, you’ll mostly attract operators who have little leverage or little experience.",

                  "text": "So you'd like someone to not only manage your ads for you but to also film your ads for you as a videographer and you're balking at the price that other people are offering to do it for?\n\nThe problem isn't that you're looking for a unicorn it's that you don't want to pay for the work that you want done. But you've got two 18 year olds willing to do it without a track record and that's exactly the kind of money that you're offering up. I dont say this to be mean. Its just the facts for the situation. \n\nHere's the other dilemma that you're going to face how much is each one of those contracts worth to you and how much would you pay them? Is it a high amount is it the $100 to $500 per 1 lead they could get getting leads for somebody who does say solar installations or Roofing? Would the percentage of any gigs that you get from it is high as the 2000$ to $4000 they would get from other Home Services on deals you close?\n\nYou should expect to pay at least a third of your gross revenue on things like your leads and incoming clientele marketing.\n\nSo this is the other Dilemma. If somebody is experienced and understands how to do your social media and you want them to film which is an entirely different area of expertise they're going to do it for clients who can pay them a lot more money for the same amount of work.\n\nNot to mention that with local Home Services it's more of a holistic approach between your Instagram and Facebook accounts mixed with your Google reviews and Google lead generation and then mix that with Google search and YouTube. And then add in the sprinkle of Yelp. So it's really like a whole thing and it's basically the most important thing that your company is going to have besides providing good services so yes it's going to cost you.\n\nI wish I had better news but I hope I laid it out in a pretty straightforward way of the problem you're going to run into. But somebody who's good at running ads and creating ads can get paid $80 to $150 pwr lead just sending those leads Nationwide to one of the lead services that you would probably be buying leads from. And they can make 20 grand to $500,000 a month. And maybe that can give you some perspective of why one client for $2,000 a month doesn't make much sense.\n\nThere are agencies that take on accounts but they'll probably charge a flat fee of like $2,000 a month plus 15% of AD spend and you're going to be required to spend at least 10 to $20,000 a month in ad spend. And even then it's going to be one of their guys in Pakistan or the Philippines running your campaigns. And then you'll have to pay $100 to $300 per ugc ad or video ad that you want to make at a minimum.\n\nThis is what I do for a living from A to Z companies in digital marketing from the ads all the way up to the leads.\n\nAnd unfortunately smaller ticket home services really just need to get basic internet presence done and then buy leads from one of these marketplaces and try and do their best to close them all.",
