People who share these hacks often leave out the context, existing audience, budget, or prior traction.\n\nAnother one I’ve seen is *“build in public and customers will come.”* It can help with trust, but without a clear ICP and problem, it often just builds an audience of other marketers, not buyers.\n\nAs an intern, the biggest realization for me has been that real marketing isn’t about hacks, it’s about **doing unglamorous fundamentals well** (clear positioning, good copy, decent distribution) for a long time. The “hack” is usually just consistency + patience, which isn’t very sellable online.",

      "text": "I'm pretty obsessed with email marketing recently, so I decided to spend the last month digging through email data from newsletter tools, ESPs, and my own experiments, and analyzed what gets people to actually open their emails.\n\nSome of this will piss off the \"best practices\" crowd. But the data doesn't lie.\n\nHere's what I found, ranked by worst to best:\n\n(I put a lot of effort into this post, so hope you find it valuable)\n\n**10. \"Newsletter\" in the subject line** \\- Instant death. People are drowning in newsletters. Calling yours a newsletter is like wearing a sign that says \"delete me.\" The worst? \"Monthly Newsletter - \\[Month\\].\" Please, just stop.\n\n**9. All caps + excessive punctuation** \\- \"LAST CHANCE!!!\" Screams desperation. Your audience isn't deaf, they're just ignoring you. Also spam filters absolutely hate this.\n\n**8. Generic promotional language** \\- \"Special offer inside\" or \"Exclusive deal for you.\" Everyone says it's exclusive. Nobody believes you anymore. These worked in 2019. It's 2026. Move on.\n\n**7. Overly clever/cryptic lines** \\- \"You won't believe what happened...\" Clickbait works on Facebook. Email audiences are smarter and more annoyed. They want value, not mystery.\n\n**6. Emoji-heavy subject lines** \\- Controversial take: emojis work, but MAX one per subject line. More than that and you look like a 14-year-old's text message. One well-placed emoji? Chef's kiss. Three fire emojis? Trash.\n\n**5. Question-based subject lines** \\- \"Are you making this mistake?\" Better than clickbait but still pretty meh. Works better in B2B than B2C. Needs to be hyper-specific to actually work.\n\n**4. Personalization (first name)** \\- \"Hey \\[Name\\], check this out.\" Works, but it's baseline now. Everyone does it. You're not special for using merge tags. Better than nothing though.\n\n**3. Time-sensitive + specific** \\- \"48 hours left: \\[specific thing\\].\" Creates urgency without being scammy. Key word: SPECIFIC. \"48 hours left\" alone doesn't work. Tell them what they're actually missing.\n\n**2. Ultra-specific value proposition** \\- \"How \\[Company\\] grew to $10M with email\". Pure value. Tell them exactly what's inside and why they should care. Funny thing - long subject lines (10-15 words) actually performed better here. All that \"keep it short\" advice? Not always true.\n\n**1. Plain, conversational, from a person** \\- \"Question for \\[name\\]\" or \"great business advice\" Why? It doesn't look like marketing. It looks like an email from a human. The best performing emails in my analysis looked like they came from a coworker, not a brand. Wild, right?\n\n**The stuff that actually matters:**\n\n* Shorter is NOT always better - 6-10 word subject lines performed best overall, but context matters way more than length\n* Mobile preview text is criminally underused - 70% of emails are opened on mobile. USE THAT SPACE.\n* Industry matters more than you think - What works in SaaS dies in e-commerce. Test your own audience.\n\nThe biggest lesson? Stop trying to \"hack\" opens. Write subject lines like you're emailing a friend. \n\nWhat's working for you? Genuinely curious what I'm missing here.",

Creator recommendations that were obviously whoever was easiest to book. Reports that were templates with our numbers filled in. Campaign management that was basically forwarding emails.\n\nWhat we didnt get: actual strategic thinking. Creators matched to our audience. Any optimization. Transparency on margins.\n\nNot saying all agencies are bad but the structure is broken. They get paid regardless of results. Theyre spread across a dozen clients.\n\nWe dropped them. Brought it in house. Results improved. Costs dropped 60%.\n\nAnyone else have horror stories or am I just unlucky?",

Add UTM tags and a campaign ID to every link so the CRM can tie activity to the right campaign. Match on email plus a contact ID if you have one to avoid dupes. Do a one-time backfill, then switch to real time. We’ve done this for landscapers and turf shops and it’s smooth once naming and fields are set.

      "text": "Used to love making videos. Now I dread posting because I know it's probably going to fail. Posted daily for 6 months. Most videos died under 500 views. Few random ones hit 2k to 3k. No pattern I could see.\n\nStarted second guessing everything. Is my personality boring? Is my voice annoying? Am I just not entertaining enough? Stopped enjoying the process. Just felt anxious and defeated.\n\nHit my breaking point 2 weeks ago. Either figure out what's wrong or quit. Looked at my retention graphs for real this time. Not just glanced. Actually studied them.\n\nEvery video that died lost people at second 7 to 9. Every video that worked held people past second 10. Watched what I was doing between second 7 and 9 in my failed videos.\n\nPausing. Visual not changing. Still explaining instead of showing. Watched what I was doing in my successful videos. Moving fast. Visual changing. Delivering value immediately.\n\nFixed my failed videos' problems. Made everything like my successful ones. Next 5 videos all hit over 15k views. My confidence came back immediately.\n\nHere's what fixed it for me.\n\n**Lack of confidence comes from not knowing why you're failing.** When you don't know what's wrong you start thinking everything's wrong. You're not. Something specific is wrong and you just can't see it.\n\n**Success builds confidence faster than anything.** One video that works because you actually knew how to fix it matters more than ten motivational posts. Fix what's broken. Post something that works. Confidence returns.\n\n**You need to see your blind spots.** I couldn't see my pauses were too long. I couldn't see my visuals were too static. They felt normal to me. I needed external feedback that was specific not just \"make better content.\"\n\n**Get something that shows you the actual problem.** Started using TikAlyzser that tells you exactly what's wrong with your videos and what to change to get more views. Second 8 pause 1.5 seconds visual static 6 seconds. Then I knew exactly what to fix. Not guessing. Knowing.\n\n**Post with confidence because you already fixed what would have killed it.** Now I post knowing it's going to work because I caught the problems before they went live. That confidence shows in my content. People can tell.\n\nLast 12 videos all over 10k views. Confidence is completely back. Enjoying creating again.\n\nIf posting fills you with dread instead of excitement something's broken and you don't know what it is. Fix that first. Confidence comes back fast after that.",

There was a gross woman named Rebecca who was sunbathing all naked, and she was fat. Douglas walked up to her and said, \"I need to poop.\" \"Okay,\" Rebecca replied, \"I like poop.\" Douglas squatted down over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. The poop sat there on Rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener.\n\n**Chapter 2**\n\n\"Why are we here?\" Douglas cried as poop came out his wiener in a long, thin strip. It was wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all. The pee-pee got on the woman's leg and she screamed, pooping out her boobs. And so when the pee got mixed with the poop it smelled like a butt. And the poop and the pee lived happily ever after. \n\n**THE END**",

What you described is exactly how confidence erosion actually happens — not from “lack of discipline,” but from **lack of clarity**.\n\nWhen you don’t know *why* something fails, your brain fills in the gaps with self-blame. Personality, voice, intelligence, talent — everything becomes suspect. That’s brutal mentally, especially when you’re doing the “right” thing by showing up daily.\n\nWhat stood out most is the **specificity** of the fix. Second 7–9 drop-off, static visuals, pausing too long. That’s actionable. “Make better content” never helps anyone — knowing *what moment loses people* does.\n\nI also think your point about confidence being a **byproduct of competence** is underrated. Motivation doesn’t fix confidence. Seeing something work because you understood and corrected a real issue does.\n\nCurious question for you:  \nDo you think posting daily helped you gather enough data to spot the issue, or do you think daily posting actually masked the problem for too long?\n\nReally solid breakdown.

      "text": "I have seen many people ask Meta Ad or Google Ads, but they don’t pay attention to the fact that their medium isn’t as big of as a deal as their marketing agency. I am not personally attacking anyone but many are simply burning their money by not intervening and questioning their marketing agency enough. I have many clients whose trust has been eroded by scammy marketing agency and I tell them, why did you let this happen? Their answer is always the same. They were oblivious. So, here are a few of my tips that everyone should use if they think their marketing agency is not doing their job.  \n  \n1. The \"Platform Trap\"Google and Meta are designed to make you spend. Their \"Auto-Apply\" recommendations are often biased toward their revenue, not your ROI. A great agency acts as a filter, knowing when to lean into the machine and when to take back the wheel\n\n.2. Creative is the New Targeting-As privacy laws and \"cookie-less\" tracking have leveled the playing field, your creative is what does the heavy lifting. If your agency isn't using data-backed storytelling, they’re just guessing.\n\n3. The Shift to \"Agentic\" Execution-The best agencies have stopped doing manual, repetitive \"button-clicking.\" They are now leveraging autonomous AI tools to handle the grunt work. By integrating stacks like Blobr AI or Ryze AI, agencies can run 24/7 audits and creative swaps that a human simply can’t keep up with.\n\nNext time, ask the important questions. It pains me to see us marketing agencies get a horrible reputation just because of a few sour apples.",

      "text": "I'm pretty obsessed with email marketing so watching my emails go straight to spam was absolutely soul crushing. Open rates under 5%. Complaints through the roof. Gmail basically blacklisted me.\n\nSpent hundreds of hours and way too much money figuring this out (most of the \"expert advice\" online is completely useless). But I think I finally cracked it.\n\nHere's what I found, ranked from least to most impactful:\n\n**10. Removing spam trigger words** \\- Everyone says \"avoid FREE and URGENT.\" Did almost nothing. Removed every \"trigger word\" and still landed in spam. This advice is from 2015 and spam filters are way smarter now. Don't waste your time obsessing over this.\n\n**9. Adding a physical address** \\- Required by law, yes. Did it help deliverability? Barely. Maybe a 1-2% improvement. Still important for compliance, but it won't save you from spam hell.\n\n**8. Using a professional email signature** \\- Added my logo, social links, the works. Looked more legit but didn't really move the needle on deliverability. Nice to have, not a game changer.\n\n**7. Reducing image-to-text ratio** \\- The old advice is \"too many images = spam.\" Cut my images way down and saw a small improvement. Maybe 5-8% better inbox placement. Helps, but it's not the main issue.\n\n**6. Consistent sending schedule** \\- This one surprised me. Sending randomly (whenever I felt like it) killed my sender reputation. Once I went to a consistent Tuesday/Thursday schedule, things improved noticeably. \n\n**5. List hygiene (removing inactive subscribers)** \\- Huge. I was scared to lose subscribers, but keeping dead emails on my list was tanking my engagement metrics. Removed anyone who hadn't opened in 6 months. Painful but necessary.\n\n**4. Double opt-in** \\- I resisted this forever because \"it reduces signups.\" Yeah, by about 30%. But the people who confirm? They're REAL. Engagement went up, complaints went down. ISPs started trusting my emails more. Worth the trade-off.\n\n**3. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records** \\- This is where it gets technical. Set up proper email authentication. Sounds boring and complicated but it's absolutely critical. Gmail and Outlook basically require this now. \n\n**2. Warming up a new domain** \\- My old domain was burned. Started fresh with a new sending domain and warmed it up properly - started with 50 emails/day, slowly increased over 6 weeks. game changer. You can't just start blasting 10k emails from a new domain.\n\n**1. Actually getting engagement (replies, opens, clicks)** \\- This is the thing nobody wants to hear. All the technical fixes mean nothing if people don't engage with your emails. ISPs watch this like hawks. I had to completely rewrite my emails to be more conversational and actually valuable. Asked questions. Encouraged replies. Made it feel like a real conversation, not a broadcast. Once engagement went up, everything else fell into place.\n\n**The biggest lesson?**\n\nThere's no magic bullet. It's a combination of technical setup + list quality + actual good content people want to read. I wasted months looking for a hack. The \"hack\" is doing the boring work correctly and writing emails people actually care about.\n\nAlso, if you're in spam now, you probably need to start fresh. Your domain reputation might be too damaged to recover. Sucks, but it's reality.\n\nAnyone else been through spam hell? What worked for you? Genuinely curious if I missed anything.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m struggling with Instagram growth and honestly feeling a bit lost. I’ve been posting high quality content, using clean profile pictures, and interacting with other IG users, but my IG account is still growing very slowly. Because of that, I started looking into options to buy Instagram followers, but the more I read, the more confusing it becomes.\n\nThere are so many posts and ads about the best sites to buy Instagram followers, promising real, active followers, premium followers, and strong organic growth. Some say it helps increase follower count, popularity, and social proof, while others warn about fake followers, empty accounts, and damaged engagement rate. It’s hard to know what’s real.\n\nWhat I really care about is my overall Instagram presence. I don’t want to buy IG followers just to see numbers go up. I want genuine followers who don’t hurt organic engagement or confuse Instagram algorithms. I’m worried about services that offer instant delivery but later cause followers to drop, reach to fall, or engagement to disappear.\n\nI’m also curious about how these Instagram services actually work in real life. Do the followers look like real IG users or fake accounts? Does buying followers help bring more followers over time, or does it only inflate the follower count? And what about customer support is there a real customer support team, or do they disappear once you pay?\n\nI’m not trying to cheat or fake success. I just want my IG account to grow in a healthy way without ruining organic engagement. If anyone here has experience with buying Instagram followers, I’d really appreciate honest feedback, good or bad. Did it help your growth, or did it hurt your account in the long run?\n\nNot looking for promotions, just real experiences from people who’ve tried this.",

The established platforms are tied to official APIs, so they’re generally not doing anything risky by default.\n\nWhere problems pop up is with patterns… posting identical content everywhere, sudden volume changes, or letting scheduling turn into full autopilot. For teams managing multiple local brands, some kind of centralized tool is almost unavoidable, and native posting often creates more inconsistency than it solves.\n\nThe horror stories are real, but they tend to be edge cases. Day to day, reputable all-in-one tools are mostly uneventful, which is kind of what most teams are aiming for.",

They follow situations, people, or something that feels like it’s happening right now. When posts lean too much into updates or announcements, engagement usually drops, even if the mission itself matters.\n\nContent often works better when it starts small. A moment, a question, or a short explanation of something most people don’t realize about the issue. Real people help too. Volunteers, staff, or even voiceovers paired with simple footage usually land better than graphics or logos.\n\nX can be frustrating for this kind of goal. Discovery there is limited, especially for awareness. TikTok or Reels tend to give more room for reach, even with imperfect posts.\n\nConsistency usually matters more than polish. A few human-feeling posts each week often outperform something that sounds official but rarely shows up.\n\nWhat kind of posts have gone out so far?",

Thought I’d share what we learned since I couldn’t find much practical info when we started.  \n**What didn’t work for us:**\n\n* Tracked links in captions/comments - complete dead end since Instagram disables clickable links on mobile\n* Trying to query the Instagram API for new followers after posts - there’s no official endpoint for this (as of Jan 2026), and scraping workarounds are risky if you’re managing client accounts\n\n**What actually worked:**\n\n* Tracked links in Stories, with posts/reels directing people to the story\n* Link-in-bio attribution tied to specific posts\n\nThe frustrating thing is Instagram deliberately makes this hard because they want you using paid ads for proper attribution. And “brand traffic” metrics that agencies use require enterprise-scale resources most smaller teams don’t have.  \nI wrote up our full breakdown including the specific approaches we tested on our Hacking Growth Substack.  \n  \nFull disclosure: I’m the founder of Leo AI, and we ended up building some of this into our platform. But the methods themselves work regardless of what tools you use - happy to answer questions about the approach itself.  \nHas anyone found other reliable methods? Curious what’s worked for others.",

I've been seeing fraud-blocker come up a lot lately for PPC teams dealing with this exact issue.\n\nIt automatically filters out fake clicks and junk leads so you're not wasting time investigating drops that are just from bad traffic inflating your numbers. Might help you rule out that variable at least before you go down teh rabbit hole with product and data teams. For the system of record question, I'd recommend setting up a simple shared doc or notion page where any team logs changes that could impact metrics.\n\nDoesn't need to be fancy, just a timestamped log everyone agrees to update.",

I’ve found it helps to map examples by funnel stage first, then brief creative off those patterns instead of vibes.

Updating structure, tightening search intent, improving internal linking, and adding missing subtopics moved a few stuck pages way faster than publishing brand new posts. I also started looking more closely at what was winning the SERP now, not what used to rank a year ago. A lot of times the format, depth, or angle had quietly changed.\n\nI also learned how to spot those opportunities better after digging into some of the strategies in odd angles media’s free Reddit SEO blueprint. It pushed me to think more in terms of demand signals and real questions people are asking, instead of just chasing keyword tools all day. That mindset shift alone helped me prioritize what was actually worth updating or expanding.\n\nIf traffic is slipping even with solid execution, I’d double down on refreshing proven pages, tightening intent match, and making sure internal links are really pushing authority where you want it. Small compounding improvements there tend to move the needle faster than constantly starting from zero.\n\nHope that helps!",

If an LLM agent has to dig for your point, it’ll just cite a competitor who made it easier to scrape.\n\n2. Structure your content into modular blocks. Your H2s and H3s should work as standalone \"Knowledge Passages\" that don't need the rest of the page for context.\n\n3. Don't ignore schema. It’s basically the translation layer for AI crawlers. Use it to tell the agents exactly what your entities are so they don't have to guess.\n\n4. Focus on Entity Co-occurrence.

Our sales team was wasting so much time chasing ghosts that it was impacting morale. The real killer was trying to understand the connections between data points. Like okay this person is a VP of Marketing now but they used to work at a company thats a known competitor and theyve been posting about a specific technology on LinkedIn. We were manually trying to piece all of that together which was taking forever. We actually found a solution thats been a game-changer. They basically have this AI-powered platform that automatically maps all these hidden relationships in our data. It sounds like magic but it pulls data from all our different sources – Sales Navigator our CRM marketing automation platform even some internal databases – and figures out whos connected to whom and how. It scrubs the data highlights important changes like someone getting a new role and flags potential leads that actually align with our ideal customer profile. For instance we had a situation where someones title hadnt been updated in Sales Navigator but the tool picked up that they were actively involved in a project related to a technology we sell based on their LinkedIn activity and mentions in some industry publications. It was buried in the noise but the platform surfaced it. The biggest win honestly was freeing up our data team. Before they were constantly building ETL pipelines and cleaning up data but now the AI handles most of that automatically. They can finally focus on more strategic stuff. Plus its empowered our sales and marketing teams to build their own custom workflows using natural language to look for the types of leads that convert so its taken the pressure off the data team. Its made a huge difference in our lead quality and conversion rates. The company that made it has a referral program (full disclosure I'd get a kickback if you sign up through me). But honestly it solved a massive headache for us and I think it could really help you too. Happy to connect you if youre interested.",
