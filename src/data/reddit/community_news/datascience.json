      "text": "**Background**\n\nDuring my PhD in Data Science at Stanford, I got sick and tired of ghost jobs & 3rd party offshore agencies on LinkedIn & Indeed. So I wrote a script that fetches jobs from 30k+ company websites' career pages and uses GPT4o-mini to extract relevant information (ex salary, remote, etc.) from job descriptions. You can use it here: ([HiringCafe](http://hiring.cafe)). Here is a filter for Data science jobs (5,335 and counting). I scrape every company 3x/day, so the results stay fresh if you check back the next day.\n\nYou can follow my progress on r/hiringcafe\n\n**How I built the HiringCafe (from a DS perspective)**\n\n1. I identified company career pages with active job listings. I used the [Apollo.io](http://apollo.io/) to search for companies across various industries, and get their company URLs. To narrow these down, I wrote a web crawler (using Node.js, and a combination of Cheerio + Puppeteer depending on site complexity) to find the career page of the company. I discovered that I could dump the raw HTML and prompt ChatGPT o1-mini to classify (as a binary classification) whether each page contained a job description or not. I thus compiled a list of verified job page if it contains a job description or not. If it contains a job description, I add it to a list and proceed to step 2\n2. Verifying legit companies. This part I had to do manually, but it was crucial that I exclude any recruiting firms, 3rd party offshore agencies, etc. because I wanted only high-quality companies directly hiring for roles at their firm. I manually sorted through the 30,000 company career pages (this took several weeks) and picked the ones that looked legit. At Stanford, we call this technique \"occular regression\" :) It was doable because I only had to verify each company a single time and then I trust it moving forward.\n3. Removing ghost jobs. I discovered that a strong predictor of if a job is a ghost job is that if it keeps being reposted. I was able to identify reposting by doing a embedding text similarity search for jobs from the same company. If 2 job descriptions overlap too much, I only show the date posted for the *earliest* listing. This allowed me to weed out most ghost jobs simply by using a date filter (for example, excluding any jobs posted over a month ago). In my anecdotal, experience this means that I get a higher response rate for data science jobs compared to LinkedIn or Indeed.\n4. Scraping fresh jobs 3x/day. To ensure that my database is reflective of the company career page, I check each company career page 3x/day. Many career pages do not have rate limits because it is in their best interest to allow web scrapers, which is great. For the few that do, I was able to use a rotating proxy. I use Oxylabs for now, but I've heard good things about ScraperAPI, Crawlera.\n5. Building advanced NLP text filters. After playing with GPT4o-mini API, I realized I could can effectively dump raw job descriptions (in HTML) and ask it to give me back formatted information back in JSON (ex salary, yoe, etc). I used this technique to extract a variety of information, including technical keywords, job industry, required licenses & security clearance, if the company sponsors visa, etc.\n6. Powerful search. Once I had the structured JSON data (containing salary, years of experience, remote status, job title, company name, location, and other relevant fields) from ChatGPT's extraction process, I needed a robust search engine to allow users to query and filter jobs efficiently. I chose Elasticsearch due to its powerful full-text search capabilities, filtering, and aggregation features. My favorite feature with Elasticsearch is that it allows me to do Boolean queries. For instance, I can search for job descriptions with technical keywords of \"Pandas\" or \"R\" (example link [here](https://hiring.cafe/?searchState=%7B%22technologyKeywordsQuery%22%3A%22%5C%22Pandas%5C%22+or+%5C%22R%5C%22+%22%7D)).\n\n# Question for the DS community here\n\nBeyond job search, one thing I'm really excited about this 2.1 million job dataset is to be able to do a yearly or quarterly trend report. For instance, to look at what technical skills are growing in demand. What kinds of cool job trends analyses would you do if you had access to this data.",

From an educators perspective job market and job posting are our upstream requirement but their quality is what you said - very volatile, written by HR instead of the teams, il outdated. Somebody must be evaluating the job market efficiency throu search times vs job description clarity... Wonder if your parsing pipeline can work for job posting in other locations and industry domains - would be so nice to have a snapshot of global jobs data from direct employees websites, eg skilled labour shortages in the Gulf, remote vs onsite work, etc",

I would be careful about raw skill frequency and focus instead on transitions, like which skills appear together over time and which ones replace others within similar role titles. Another angle is lead time, how long after a new tool or framework becomes visible in research or open source, does it start showing up in job requirements. you could also look at variance, not just means, for things like years of experience or salary bands to see where roles are becoming more standardized versus more ambiguous. One thing to watch is survivorship and posting bias, since companies that overhire or churn roles can distort trends if you do not normalize by employer behavior. Done carefully, this kind of data can say a lot about how the market actually digests new ideas rather than just reacting to hype.",

I was on Oxylabs too but switched because the pay-as-you-go model made more sense for bursty scraping workloads where you don't need proxies running 24/7. Their resi pool has been solid for the sites that block datacenter IPs.\n\nFor the trend analysis question - I'd look at how skill co-occurrence patterns shift over time. Like tracking when \"LLM\" started appearing alongside \"data engineering\" roles vs purely ML ones. That'd be way more interesting than raw keyword counts.",

Like when i pass 'project manager' i get back a bar graph w/ 'project management' , 'budget planning', 'pmp' in this order with % mentioned against them signifying how many jobs does it ask for this skill along with how many actual jobs of 'project manager' were looked up to get this figure .   \nit tells me which skills should i prioritize if i intend to move to this role. \n\nhope this give some worthy ideas. i'm sure u'll improve upon this to make them better. \n\ni worked on an available dataset of 90K+ jobs but it was poor dataset. if possible for you, can u put up an old piece of dataset to kaggle or something where i can get and work on my analysis again. it can be like 6month data of 2025.

You need experience in recruiting, hiring, managing, and leading to understand that fact.\n\nIgnore the downvote noise. You are right.\n\n\nMost people here don't get it because they haven’t done the job. I have. I spent years in executive search, and I know for a fact that the best candidates are not refreshing job boards or checking their job alerts. They are busy kicking tail in their current roles. To find the talent that actually matters, you have to go get them. You don't wait for them to come to you. You only understand that distinction if you’ve actually been in the arena.\nOP, I love what you’ve done here and why you could do. Indeed and LinkedIn have turned into uncaring giants that treat humans like numbers. It is time to stop feeding them.\n\nI have been using my math background to work on this exact problem. I want to automate sourcing to find that hidden talent. If you are serious about disrupting the greedy headhunting firms and waking up the people who have been asleep at the wheel, we need to talk.\n\nLet’s build something real that solves the big problem.",

As u/Monolikma says, sourcing is a key challenge…but I’d go one step farther and say quality, viable sourcing.  \n\nFrom the company perspective that means finding good, ready-to-hire candidates (not just a ton of applicants).  From the candidate perspective that means finding a role you’d like and have a good chance of getting hired (not just decent keyword matching).\n\nTo my thinking there are a few directions you could go with this, depending on the problem you want to solve.  Some example include:\n\n(1) Writing better job recs (on multiple fronts)\n(2) Improved candidate matching and prescreening\n(3) Guiding built/buy/borrow talent decisions\n\nHR tech companies like SAP, Workday, Oracle and niche providers are trying to solve these but haven’t been able to crack the code.  I’ve done collaborations with them at a few large consulting firms where I’ve worked.  Happy to share those stories if you’d find that constructive.\n\nLove what you’re doing.  It’s similar to a concept I put on the shelf a year ago because I couldn’t figure out how to source and process some of this data.\n\nI’d love to connect directly and riff on ideas, if you’re open to it.",

So you simultaneously have to treat them like a 5yo child to not lose them, while keeping in mind that they're also sharp af and underestimating them is dangerous. And once they understand the insights, they can go very quickly from 0 to 100 and it can be exhausting to keep up if your business knowledge or understanding is lacking.\n\nThe worst that can happen is if you reached a conclusion that subtly/covertly clashes with business understanding (you're in for a thorough, lengthy, and annoying analysis on why this happened and what this means for the business, even if it's true), or God forbids, if some of the dumbing down created an inconsistency with an insight/number you put somewhere else (game over, that's a total loss of credibility, might as well pack it up and go back home...).",

A generalist, one might say. \n\nI am looking for new jobs but all I get calls are for Gen AI. But their JD mentions other stuff - Relational DBs, Cloud, Standard ML toolkit...you get it. So, I had assumed GenAI would not be the primary requirement, but something like good-to-have.\n\nBut upon facing the interview, it turns out, **these are GenAI developer roles** that require heavily technical and training of LLM models. Oh, these are all API calling companies, not R&D.\n\nClearly, I am not a good fit. But I am unable to get roles/calls in standard business facing data science roles. This kind of indicates the following things:\n\n1. Gen AI is wayyy too much in demand, inspite of all the AI Hype.\n2. The DS boom in last decade has an oversupply of generalists like me, thus standard roles are saturated.\n\n**I would like to know your opinions and definitely can use some advice.**\n\n**Note**: The experience is APAC-specific.

The first is technical – are you handling the data correctly, is your code organized enough that you can debug, that sort of thing. The second is the ability to think critically about what’s going on in the real situation that you are modeling, and how that line lines up against the model that you are using.\n\nIn the early days of data science, when it was kind of mysterious to a lot of people, they tended to hire PhD‘s and think they needed some kind of super genius to do the job. But that’s just not the case, and now people are catching on.

Banks aren't replacing their credit risk models with GPT-4. Supply chains still need actual predictions, not chatbots.\n\nBut here's what's happening - those \"standard business facing DS roles\" are getting automated differently. Not by GenAI, but by better tooling that makes feature engineering way faster. So companies need fewer generalists to ship the same fraud model that used to take a team 6 months.\n\nThe GenAI gold rush is real, but 90% of those roles are glorified API integration like you said. Give it 12-18 months and there'll be a correction when companies realize they hired 10 prompt engineers and still can't predict inventory shortage.\n\nMy 2¢: Don't chase GenAI just because it's hot. Double down on domain expertise (banking risk, supply chain optimization) + production ML fundamentals. When the hype settles, the people who can actually ship models that make money will be the ones left standing.\n\nAPAC market is weird rn though.

It is also really easy to create custom stuff and import/tweak it for other things.\n\nEdit: This is my first time hearing about Marimo notebooks though. Sounds like they copied Observable Notebooks idea but for Python. Very cool.\n\nEdit 2: Ope Marimo made a Quarto extension a while back.

So don’t just practice answering which model you’d use, but also think about how to communicate constraints, failure modes, trade-offs, etc.\n\nEssentially, don’t just rely on AI to generate answers. You still have to do the explaining and thinking yourself, and that requires deeper practice.\n\nI’m curious though how data science/analytics candidates are experiencing this. Has anything changed with your interview experience in light of AI? Have you adapted your interview prep to accommodate this shift (if any)?",

The number of people who come across fine on soft skills, but whose statistics are limited to sklearn, Airflow jobs, and mean/median/mode who then think that qualifies them to do cutting edge research in data linkage/entity resolution, editing and imputation, complex sample design and estimation, small area estimation, statistical disclosure control, index numbers, and Bayesian analysis is just weirdly high.

      "text": "I see multiple highly-upvoted comments per day saying things like “LLMs aren’t AI,” demonstrating a complete misunderstanding of the technical definitions of these terms. Or worse, comments that say “this stuff isn’t AI, AI is like \\*insert sci-fi reference\\*.” And this is just comments on very high-level topics. If these views are not just being expressed, but are widely upvoted, I can’t help but think this sub is being infiltrated by laypeople without any background in this field and watering down the views of the knowledgeable DS community. I’m wondering if others are feeling this way.\n\nEdits to address some common replies:\n\n* I misspoke about \"the technical definition\" of AI. As others have pointed out, there is no single accepted definition for artificial intelligence.\n* It  is widely accepted in the field that machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\n   * In the 4th Edition of Russell and Norvig's Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (one of the, if not the, most popular academic texts on the topic) states\n\n>In the public eye, there is sometimes confusion between the terms “artificial intelligence” and “machine learning.” Machine learning is a subfield of AI that studies the ability to improve performance based on experience. Some AI systems use machine learning methods to achieve competence, but some do not.\n\n* My point isn't that everyone who visits this community should know this information. Newcomers and outsiders should be welcome. Comments such as \"LLMs aren’t AI\" indicate that people are confidently posting views that directly contradict widely accepted views within the field. If such easily refutable claims are being confidently shared and upvoted, that indicates to me that more nuanced conversations in this community may be driven by confident yet uninformed opinions. None of us are experts in everything, and, when reading about a topic I don't know much about, I have to trust that others in that conversation are informed. If this community is the blind leading the blind, it is completely worthless.",

Or linear regression for that matter, which is basically primitive ML.\n\nNot sure it has always been the case that ML was considered AI though. At least during my time doing this stuff, I feel like that AI being an umbrella term encompassing ML was a defined post hoc; these categories, terms and definitions were trying to describe new conceptual evolutions of what has already existed but were thought of differently in a differently conceptualized landscape.\n\nCuz then and now, the fundamental tech behind ML and what we call AI is still statistical learning, optimizations of some statistical functions, just brought to extreme depth and complexity. But the branding — both how we talk and think of the field and its potential in the bigger picture — has evolved.\n\nSo my recollection was that the idea of what is AI concretized (to some extent) when it was sorta layered on top of ML once neural networks started to show real usefulness and captured wider public attention/lay practitioner interest. Both terms have been around for a long time but I feel like the definition of AI was very nebulous and defined on more of a philosophical basis (which sci-fi has a lot to do with) rather than in terms of actual technology that hadn't yet existed or yet been associated with AI, until neural networks — with their artificial brain connotations — brought the AI term into what was the ML landscape, which was already pretty clearly defined in technical/real terms.\n\nWhat we previously thought of as statistical machines, essentially just applied statistics, was rebranded as part of the AI field because it was rethought of as part of that bigger picture ever since we landed on a more concrete idea of what AI is (no longer magic but a big complex statistical learning-based machine, with epistemological questions put aside such as whether machines \"really\" understand like humans do).\n\nTbh, when I think about AI, I still feel cognitive dissonance sometimes between the philosophical idea of AI and the umbrella we currently call AI technology.",

Machine learning is a subsect of AI, any ML model is considered AI. Whether people say ML/AI/whatever is a separate thing that’s always been changing, but no one was ever arguing that it’s not AI, in fact professionals were actively taught that it is.\n\nAlso, it’s funny when you say “in the traditional sense” because it’s the opposite that’s the case. Traditionally, these things were all originally AI. Even the most simplistic statistical models were considered AI back in the past. As more advanced models come out, those models start being called AI, and we start referring to the older/simpler models as something else. In the traditional sense, all of these models were AI and it’s revisionist to act as if traditionally it was only reserved for whatever you consider to be AI. People might only refer to the newest models as AI, but no one was ever arguing that the older models weren’t AI.\n\nIt seems to me that since LLMs blew up, you’ve got a large mix of people becoming more interested in AI/ML/DL/DS. Most of which are mainly hobbyists or those aspiring to work in or study in this field, but crucially none of them have any actual formal education on the matter. They’re not experts, and they’re confusing having an interest in something as being an expert in it when they aren’t.",

It's a fairly well defined term, but it's not describing the same thing as what a lot of people want it to describe, which is some notion of an artificial mind. Additionally, digital minds are mostly the domain of fiction and philosophy, not data science. \n\nIt's also a large domain of crank science, which I suspect is why OP has a fairly strong reaction to seeing it.

In data science, the view that ML is a subset of AI is standard, and something that is taught very early in many courses touching the topic. If people are confidently stating such claims that directly contradict basic and uncontroversial views in the field without any additional reference or explanation, that indicates to me that more nuanced conversations in this community may be driven by confident yet uninformed opinions. None of us are experts in everything, and, when reading about a topic I don't know much about, I have to trust that others in that conversation are informed. If this community is the blind leading the blind, it is completely worthless to me.",

I also agree with another comment here that it’s very company-dependent. There are large, mature companies where experimentation is core to the business, Uber being a good example, and those roles can be very well compensated.\n\nThat said, I do enjoy the decision-making side of the work, and I’m getting the opportunity to move into this space now, even without deep hands-on experience yet.

EDA, bespoke models, etc. need the infrastructure, software engineering, and ops skills that MLEs bring to the table so that DS/applied researchers/whatever can focus on their strengths. I've had the MLE and related titles since the beginning of 2018 (before that was more traditional enterprise SWE and DE) and it's always been to support teams doing their own EDA and building their own models, a good chunk of it being in computer vision but also more traditional ML work.",

I don't have a strong opinion on whether one will change more drastically than the other, but I would hazard a guess they'll be impacted to similar degrees.\n\n2. Within the same company, ML roles will pay at least as well as product data science, and usually better. However, product data science at a top-paying company pays much better than ML at an average-paying company, so if you have a more differentiated advantage in experimentation and causal inference, that can still be the better-paying path in the long term.\n\n3. On-call is more likely if you're responsible for serving ML models in production, though that won't always be the case. Data science can have busier periods around big product releases and the like, but pages in the middle of the night are rare.\n\n4. Generally data science, though at many companies data teams aren't as influential as we might like them to be. Obviously there are still really important strategic elements to leading ML teams, but they tend to be distinct from the overall company strategy unless the ML models are core to the company's product.\n\nI think the main difference in practice is just how you spend your time on a day-to-day basis. Yes you're writing code and building models in both roles, but deploying and hardening a model at scale in production vs. developing an ad-hoc model and presenting the results to support a business decision are pretty different workflows.",

It is what I am doing these days as well, as I wanted to move away from all the hype. I just don’t deal with hype too well.\n\nI personally consider causal inference harder because, as others said, there is no ground truth. For example, in marketing, you run experiments, but they are often messy, so many things can happen alongside your experimental changes, and your synthetic counterfactuals may misbehave because some control units decided to go rogue. It’s much richer than “let me check if this model satisfies an accuracy of X”. It is as if you were playing with a dice and trying to determine its statistics, except that the dice is quite volatile and its faces change over time, so we don’t even know if the statistics are truly meaningful no matter how rigorous you try to be.\n\nI find any other type of ML, including GenAI, pretty tame compared to this. If anything, I wish more people realized that these image and language problems are in fact easy because the input-output relationship is relatively stable, and most/all of the signal you need is guaranteed to be in your data.

I’ve tried the following:\n\n\\- Being inquisitive and asking them to explain design decisions \n\n\\- walking them through our systems and discussing the good/bad/ugly\n\n\\- being vulnerable about past decisions that were suboptimal\n\n\\- offering to provide feedback before design review with cross functional partners\n\nNone of this has worked. I am mostly ignored. When I point out something obvious (e.g 12 second latency is unacceptable for live inference) they claim there is no time to fix it. They write dozens of pages of documents that do not have answers to simple questions (what ML algorithms are you using? What data do you need at inference time? What systems rely on your responses).  They then claim no one is knowledgeable enough to understand their approach. It seems like when something doesn’t go their way they just stonewall and gaslight.\n\nI personally have never dealt with this before. I’m curious if anyone has coached a team to unlearn these behaviors and heal cross functional relationships.\n\nMy advice right now is to break apart the team and either help them find non-ML roles internally or let them go.

Right now I have about 6 labels, but I don’t know how many will show up over time, and some labels appear inconsistently or disappear for long stretches. My initial labeled dataset is \\~6,000 rows and it’s extremely imbalanced: one class dominates and the smallest class has only a single example. New data keeps coming in, and my boss wants us to retrain using the model’s inferences plus the human corrections made afterward by someone with domain knowledge. I have concerns about retraining on inferences, but that's a different story.\n\nGiven this setup, should retraining typically use all accumulated labeled data, a sliding window of recent data, or something like a recent window plus a replay buffer for rare but important classes? Would incremental/online learning (e.g., partial\\_fit style updates or stream-learning libraries) help here, or is periodic full retraining generally safer with this kind of label churn and imbalance? I’d really appreciate any recommendations on a robust policy that won’t collapse into the dominant class, plus how you’d evaluate it (e.g., fixed “golden” test set vs rolling test, per-class metrics) when new labels can appear.",

Here’s the 2nd post on best practices how to make data cleaning less painful and tedious.\n\n# Data cleaning is a loop\n\nMost real projects follow the same cycle:\n\n**Discovery → Investigation → Resolution**\n\nExample (e-commerce): you see random revenue spikes and a model that predicts “too well.” You inspect spike days, find duplicate orders, talk to the payment team, learn they retry events on timeouts, and ingestion sometimes records both. You then dedupe using an event ID (or keep latest status) and add a flag like collapsed\\_from\\_retries for traceability.\n\nIt’s a loop because you rarely uncover all issues upfront.\n\n# When it becomes slow and painful\n\n* Late / incomplete discovery: you fix one issue, then hit another later, rerun everything, repeat.\n* Cross-team dependency: business and IT don’t prioritize “weird data” until you show impact.\n* Context loss: long cycles, team rotation, meetings, and you end up re-explaining the same story.\n\n# Best practices that actually help\n\n**1) Improve Discovery (find issues earlier)**\n\nTwo common misconceptions:\n\n* exploration isn’t just describe() and null rates, it’s “does this behave like the real system?”\n* discovery isn’t only the data team’s job, you need business/system owners to validate what’s plausible\n\nA simple repeatable approach:\n\n* quick first pass (formats, samples, basic stats)\n* write a small list of **project-critical assumptions** (e.g., “1 row = 1 order”, “timestamps are UTC”)\n* test assumptions with targeted checks\n* validate fast with the people who own the system\n\n**2) Make Investigation manageable**\n\nTreat anomalies like product work:\n\n* prioritize by **impact vs cost** (with the people who will help you).\n* frame issues as outcomes, not complaints (“if we fix this, the churn model improves”)\n* track a small backlog: observation → hypothesis → owner → expected impact → effort\n\n**3) Resolution without destroying signals**\n\n* keep **raw data immutable** (cleaned data is an interpretation layer)\n* implement transformations **by issue** (e.g., resolve\\_gateway\\_retries()), not generic “cleaning steps”, not by column.\n* preserve uncertainty with flags (was\\_imputed, rejection reasons, dedupe indicators)\n\n**Bonus**: documentation is leverage (especially with AI tools)\n\nDon’t just document code. Document **assumptions and decisions** (“negative amounts are refunds, not errors”). Keep a short living “cleaning report” so the loop gets cheaper over time.",

So this means build your classifier with your favorite algorithm, logistic, random-forest, xg-boost, whatever gives you a decent performance on a test set, recaliberate it - sklearn has isotonic regression and platt scaling, choose the one one that gives you the best result.\n\nPractically, in these kind of problems, you need to understand and determine the trade off between the false positive rate and the false negative rate. This is in relation to picking a threshold for classifying an example as a positive - 0.5 won't be optimal. In a marketing application, false positives may be one you control, in a health care setting (screening for a disease), a false negative is what you control. But to get back to your question, if you choose to work with the imbalance, then recalibration usually helps. Good luck",
