Not all of them are incredibly complex (quite often the opposite as they emphasize explainability), but the scientists who do well here are able to understand high value/complex business problems and apply the right solution. I like to think of it like the ship repair problem.\n\nA ship's engine failed, halting production, and no mechanic could fix it. An expert tapped a specific spot with a hammer, instantly repairing it. The $10,000 bill was questioned, prompting the expert to itemize: $1 for tapping, $9,999 for knowing where to tap, highlighting that expertise, not just education and effort, holds immense value.",

That’s not to say that I don’t get a lot of FAANG candidates that are terrible. Just last 1-2 weeks I interviewed a former Meta and Amazon DS that could barely pass a simple algorithms interview. But the only candidates that ever completely crush my theoretical stats or optimization interviews are FAANG or FAANG adjacent (AirBnB, Uber, Stitch Fix from 5 years ago, etc), particularly Netflix and Google.\n\nI don’t know what type of DS roles you had in mind, the picture could be different from more product analytics roles. But for roles with a high technical bar, that’s not my experience.\n\nAlso, I would say companies are like schools, the biggest difference isn’t at the average but the p80 or p90.",

At FAANG, the question/idea comes up Monday, there’s a team spun up Tuesday with 3 docs for alignment, then 1-2 people powering through deeper analyses than I saw elsewhere Wednesday, a pre-meeting with leads and a few $1B+ scoped org leaders Thursday (who’ve already asked twice that week when you’d be done), then VPs shift teams to focus the laser on your DS recs after an audience Friday, probably netting 5x the yearly salary for the group in the next quarter of execution, while the same cycle starts the next week. All while 2-5 mega projects are ongoing, and metrics reports and ad hoc analyses are being written at all times. TBH, the roles are vastly underpaid at $500k for the value they truly create by aiming the $10M/yr engineering team that drives 6-9x ROI year after year (literally, I calculated this as part of planning: 6x ROI on headcount was the bottom cutoff for “right sizing” the org last year, with mean Eng cost of $950k as the input).\n\nThat’s the lowest level DS. The rest crush more. No joke. It’s just not the same scale, and every DS is extraordinarily capable or we just get other ones.\n\nThere’s a lot of talk about hiring fresh PhDs by other companies in the comments here and tbh, the hard part is never technical (that’s the minimum cost of entry), it’s doing a job and making the company value and prioritizing work—that’s why companies pay big bucks.",

It does take a certain personality trait to grind through technical materials (and prep for grueling tech interviews) for a long time. Most people simply do not have the mental stamina or curiosity.\n\nAnother stark contrast is the ability to see what is important vs. what is not.

Not sure, really. I'm maybe not among the handful of people that can take most of the credit for success, but still, I'm happy to have maneuvered myself in the right place, at the right time, and out of intellectual interest pursuing some good career decisions early on. PhD, publications (only a handful that I'm proud of), tenure at a research uni, research interest in somewhat relevant things (although everything turns over every few years), and most importantly willing to be quite flexible and to take some risks. Also, working reasonably well with others.   Jensen Huang keeps pointing out the value of [thinking over coding](https://www.storyboard18.com/brand-makers/nvidias-jensen-huang-wants-engineers-to-think-not-code-in-the-age-of-ai-87864.htm). Similarly, you can run yet another PCA, ANOVA, or fit a nice GLMER. Many others can, too. But putting the results in business perspective, thinking about what is the \"right\" thing to do as opposed to merely optimizing shareholder value in the short term, and understanding decision-making under uncertainty from a bigger perspective, separates people, I think.",

It means being able to work in teams and across functions to deliver product OTIF and also communicate what is going on to stakeholders and end users alike.

          "text": "I have a different take for this thread...  \n  \nOnce upon a time, I too thought the pinnacle of a tech career was working for a FAANG. I applied a few times, got the standard rejections, and assumed that meant I wasn’t “elite” enough. I was just a government data scientist... useful, sure, but hardly the \"glamorous world of Silicon Valley.\"\n\nOver time, though, that illusion cracked. The more I learned about what many of those high‑paid engineers actually do: optimizing ad funnels, tuning engagement loops, building systems that nudge people into buying, scrolling, or arguing... and so, the less appealing it looked. Important in its own way, maybe, but not exactly the kind of work that feeds the soul.\n\nMeanwhile, I was quietly building something else.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, I started teaching myself machine learning.  “Deep learning” was considered fringe and even considered a joke by some in the data science community, but they then gave rise to LLMs and so much more. I was fascinated and given I understood some of the math of how vector embeddings work and how the models turned language problems into geometry problems, it was interesting to me.\n\nAbout 11 years ago, I met an NVIDIA engineer at a conference. He walked me through how their GPUs were architected: simple compute units, discrete memory blocks, all designed for massive parallelism. Perfect for linear algebra. Perfect for neural nets. And then he explained CUDA, and how it let you tap into all that power from high‑level languages like Python without wrestling with the hardware directly. That conversation stuck with me.\n\nAround the same time, I held some Amazon and Microsoft stock. But when my agency began moving into cloud, ethics rules kicked in: I couldn’t work on cloud initiatives while holding stock in the companies providing the services. So I sold it. And I reinvested the proceeds into… NVIDIA.\n\nThat five‑figure investment grew into seven figures. I added positions in companies like ASML and Lam Research, \"picks-and-shovels\" stocks that made far more sense to me than chasing the hype of OpenAI etc. Today, my investments earn me more than my government salary, and more than I’d likely be making at a FAANG. I’m financially independent. If I wanted to retire tomorrow, I could.\n\nBut I haven’t. Not yet. I want to see my kid through grad school - he's now a second-generation data scientist, delving into policy, AI ethics and a bunch of other things that will be important in coming years.  Along with having done some grounded work in wrangling data in areas as diverse as astrophysics and healthcare. And I still care deeply about my agency’s mission: real public‑interest work, not algorithms designed to maximize outrage, sell crap people don't need, or keep people glued to a screen.\n\nSo now, when I think about FAANG?  \nI don’t feel envy. I don’t feel regret.  \nI just feel… free.\n\nI built a path that made more sense for me - technically, financially, and ethically. And I wouldn’t trade it for anything.",

Then you have the option to do multiple rounds of coarse-to-fine random search from there.\n\nIf you're training larger or more expensive models, this may be where you stop due to budget or time constraints. I would say this is a concern if you're using more heavy duty neural nets for nlp, vision etc. but not typically for xgboost. More searching [gives better expected results](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03004) if you can fit it in your budget.\n\nThen once you have confidence you've narrowed down the neighborhood you're looking in, you can try Bayesian optimization using the validation metrics collected so far as a starting point. This part is just squeezing out the last little bits of performance.\n\nHyper parameter tuning with different frameworks usually let you pick the number of runs per round and the first round will usually do a random search for you before moving to Bayesian optimization. Just make sure the number of models in the initial round is not too small.\n\nEdit: hyperlinks properly working",

If you're doing an exhaustive grid search, I would recommend using the different optimizer/search methods.  \nIt will likely take a fraction of the time with other methods, and even if you don't get the best of the best hyper parameters it'll likely only differ from the absolute best by an insignificant amount in terms of the metric you're using.\n\nFor relatively simple and small models, I find [Halving Grid Search ](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV) is a fast and simple way that gets decent enough results.

If I did my part right, the value was there.\n\nNow as a team lead, the bottleneck feels very different. It’s much more about judgment than execution:\n\n* Is this problem even worth solving?\n* Does it matter for the business or the system as a whole?\n* Is it worth spending our limited time and people on it instead of something else?\n* How do I get results *through* other people and through the organization, rather than by doing everything myself?\n\nI find that being “technically right” is often not the hard part anymore. The harder part is deciding *what* to be right about, and *where* to apply effort.\n\nFor those of you who’ve made a similar transition:\n\n* How did you train your sense of value judgment?\n* How do you decide what *not* to work on?\n* What helped you move from “doing good work yourself” to “creating leverage through others”?\n* Any mental models, habits, or mistakes-you-learned-from that were particularly helpful?\n\nWould love to hear how people here think about this shift.

A good week was not shipping something myself, but unblocking someone else, killing a low value project early, or reframing a vague request into something the team could actually execute. That felt uncomfortable at first because it is less visible and less concrete.\n\nMy sense of judgment got better by sitting closer to stakeholders and paying attention to second order effects. You start noticing which projects quietly create leverage and which ones just generate slides. Saying no became easier once I saw how much opportunity cost there really is. the hardest habit to break was jumping into do the work because I could do it faster. Letting others struggle a bit, while still supporting them, ended up creating way more value long term.

And this position should come with more responsibility around what to do and why you do it. \n\nAlso, I would expect this position to have more cross-company visibility and influence.

          "text": "Lots of good wisdom in already in this thread but I'll add my two cents on how to get work done through other people rather than doing in yourself. I read once in a management book (I think it was \"the making of a manager\") that your job as a team lead is to 1) define a goal, 2) help your team understand if they are moving towards that goal, and 3) inspire them to care about that goal. In my experience, that second role - helping people understand if they're moving towards a goal - is the most important part but it's also easiest to overlook. It can be tough in data work to understand if you're making progress or if you're getting stuck in a rabbit hole. Your instincts on how to zig and zag through various small decisions are likely great, which is why you got promoted, and now your job is to imprint upon your intuitions and tastes on your team so that they can start to make those same micro-decisions. So its important to both checkin frequently to help make those decisions, as well as explain your reasoning (e.g. \"we want to display the data in this way because our stakeholders are particularly interested in understanding this dimension of the data\" versus \"use a bar chart because its cleaner\"). \n\n  \nRelatedly, the best tactical management advice I ever got was \"don't only taste the soup when it's done.\" The worst thing you can do as a team lead is assign a task that takes weeks and only review it when it's done. By contrast, great head chefs will check in along the way to see how their chefs are prepping the ingredients, they will take an early taste of the stock, give adjustments, etc. That can sometimes be hard for younger ICs since they might believe that they should only show you finished products or only checkin when they've made great progress. So you'll need to encourage checkins when they're stuck and help them feel comfortable being vulnerable when something is not going well.",

          "text": "From what I have seen, the strategy matters less than being honest about what problem you are actually trying to offload. A lot of teams jump straight to “generate code” and hit the validation wall you describe, because the review cost is real. The places where it seems to work better are narrow, well scoped tasks where correctness is easy to check, like draft documentation, test cases, or refactoring suggestions rather than greenfield logic. On the tooling side, flexibility usually comes from constraining the interface rather than the model. If the inputs and outputs are boring and well defined, the LLM can be sloppy internally without breaking anything. The harder question is whether the team is willing to invest in those interfaces, because that work often looks like overhead rather than leverage at first.",

Ask for one function or one idea, not a full script. Short answers are easier to read and trust. A quick explanation with the code helps catch mistakes fast. As another redditor pointed out, decide on a particular template format you want the LLM input and output to be based upon and it will help you to streamline the use case workflows much better..Lastly, LLM’s efficiency is entirely depended on the context, the inputs you are provided, the sources you are asking it to refer to before it spurts out the responses, hence having a proper data source, data cleaning, document chunking, embeddings , RAG models, evaluation metrics..pondering over all of these goes a long way in unleashing these machine bots in an effective manner",

          "text": "No questions myself but wanted to open myself to questions for folks who are looking to transition into the field or grow their DS career. I’m a staff-level data scientist at a hyperscaler in SF that you have heard of. I’ve been in the field for 6 years now. I come from a non-conventional background (before DS I worked in various roles across warehouse ops for an ecommerce startup, management consulting, and finance). \n\n[please don’t message me for a referral - I typically only refer folks I can vouch for personally 🙏]\n\n\n- EQ > IQ. DS is a field that attracts a lot of smart, quiet introverts. Working on sociability, networking, and “putting yourself out there” returns far higher dividends than polishing your resume or gaining more and more tech skills. It may surprise you but speaking to folks at conferences, parties, or worst case LinkedIn messaging your school alumni can open lots of unexpected doors. \n- The same is true on the job. Surprise: people like working with those they like to be around. Landing impact and doing well in your data science role is 75% stakeholder management and 25% actually coding. The most successful DSes aren’t those with the best code, they’re those who can run the business. \n- Data science isn’t an entry level job. An entry level data scientist typically has at least a few years work experience in an adjacent role. I see a lot of folks coming from economic consulting, analytics, product management, and academia. The reason for this is that domain knowledge and business acumen are necessary to translate your technical work into a business result.\n- Breaking into data science can be somewhat random. My best advice for those not in the industry is to look for opportunities to use data science methods to improve processes or change the business wherever you currently work. I landed my first data science role because I started applying data science methods to inventory management, then moved on to support our ads team, and eventually got a new “analytics” job title. That cracked the door open for me to enter data science.",

I have a few questions since I will finalize my higher education soon and I figured that this would be the best place to get good contructive opinions and advice. \n\nI am currently a student in migration studies (BA and currently writing the thesis for the MA). Throughout these studies I have been able to discover different statistical methods of analysis and I have tried to focused on that whenever I had the opportunity. Turns out I really like working with stats and big datasets from formulating a research question to providing clear and comprehensible results with good visualizations. During this MA I have also done an internship at the department of the university where I basically was the 'stats guy' and did a bunch of stuff with a fresh new database and helped every researchers who were working with it. I will also use stats for my thesis. I will do a second MA next year (if I get admitted 🤞) that is much more focused on economy and includes more stats focused courses, nottably econometrics.\n\nWith all of this background I would really like to find a job as a data analyst or anything related to data gathering/vizualization/ risk analysis, etc.. I was wondering if you think that my profile is something common in this job market? From what I have seen online and what information I got from my network, data analysts are needed but many job posts seem to search for profiles in computer science which is not really where I come from. (Btw I live in Scandinavia and can speak French, english and hopefully a nordic language soon)\n\nAnyway, thank you in advance for reading all of this! If you think you have anything interesting to say about this please do😁",

          "text": "I recommend thinking about whether you enjoy what you are doing. It is ok if you started off heading into data science, but found yourself loving something else. It sounds like you are getting value exposure to driving a business and you shouldn’t discount that just because it wasn’t a part of your original career plan. \n\nOne of my biggest mistakes in my career and holding on too tightly on my career paths. I always wanted to do public policy. I fought for years to remain in public policy even as it didn’t fit the direction life was taking me. Eventually I accepted that data science is what made the most sense for the experiences I was having, the opportunities that I was getting, and the constraints in my life. Once I became open to something other than my original plans, everything made sense and, funny enough, I found a way to contribute to public policy.\n\nSo my advice is to hold your career plans with an open hand. If you enjoy what you are doing now and are getting value experience, pour yourself into it. If data science is a deep and persistent passion, as your pour yourself into what you are doing now, you will naturally tackle it in a way that’s unique to someone with a passion in data science and your existing experiences will migrate closer to your career plans. But don’t let your career plans become a ball and chains that limit your ability to get experiences that you didn’t plan on getting or discover passion/talent that you didn’t plan on developing.",
