The cognitive switching cost point is especially real. Before AI tooling, I'd spend a full morning on a single analysis. Now there's this implicit pressure to have multiple workstreams going because the AI handles the grunt work. But the thinking work -- framing the right question, validating assumptions, communicating results to stakeholders -- that hasn't gotten faster at all. What I've found helpful is being very explicit with leadership about the difference between AI made step 3 faster and the entire project takes less time. Those are very different statements, and conflating them is exactly how workload creep sneaks in. Our team started doing weekly scope reviews specifically to catch scope creep disguised as efficiency gains and it's made a real difference.",

When we report data with all the complexity of the methods, limitations, confounds, and measurements of uncertainty, management tends to respond with a common refrain:\n\n**\"Keep it simple. The executives can't wrap their minds around all of this.\"**\n\nBut there's a simple, two-step method you can use to make sure your data reports are always understood by the people in charge:\n\n1. Fire the executives\n2. Celebrate getting rid of the dead weight\n\nYou'll find this makes every part of your work faster, better, and more enjoyable.",

So don’t just practice answering which model you’d use, but also think about how to communicate constraints, failure modes, trade-offs, etc.\n\nEssentially, don’t just rely on AI to generate answers. You still have to do the explaining and thinking yourself, and that requires deeper practice.\n\nI’m curious though how data science/analytics candidates are experiencing this. Has anything changed with your interview experience in light of AI? Have you adapted your interview prep to accommodate this shift (if any)?",

The number of people who come across fine on soft skills, but whose statistics are limited to sklearn, Airflow jobs, and mean/median/mode who then think that qualifies them to do cutting edge research in data linkage/entity resolution, editing and imputation, complex sample design and estimation, small area estimation, statistical disclosure control, index numbers, and Bayesian analysis is just weirdly high. Like I get the job market absolutely *sucks* right now, but we're not looking for bootcamp graduates or data engineers, we're looking for people who fit roughly halfway between industry DS/statisticians and academic DS/statisticians to develop real methods and methodologies, not just ship fitted models or make awesome clean datasets (although we do need them, not my team though).

      "text": "My startup was acquired by a legacy enterprise. We were primarily acquired for our technical talent and some high growth ML products they see as a strategic threat. \n\nTheir ML team is entirely entry-level and struggling badly. They have very poor fundamentals around labeling training data, build systems without strong business cases, and ignore reasonable feedback from engineering partners regarding latency and safe deployment patterns. \n\nI am staff level MLE and have been asked to up level this team. I’ve tried the following:\n\n\\- Being inquisitive and asking them to explain design decisions \n\n\\- walking them through our systems and discussing the good/bad/ugly\n\n\\- being vulnerable about past decisions that were suboptimal\n\n\\- offering to provide feedback before design review with cross functional partners\n\nNone of this has worked. I am mostly ignored. When I point out something obvious (e.g 12 second latency is unacceptable for live inference) they claim there is no time to fix it. They write dozens of pages of documents that do not have answers to simple questions (what ML algorithms are you using? What data do you need at inference time? What systems rely on your responses).  They then claim no one is knowledgeable enough to understand their approach. It seems like when something doesn’t go their way they just stonewall and gaslight.\n\nI personally have never dealt with this before. I’m curious if anyone has coached a team to unlearn these behaviors and heal cross functional relationships.\n\nMy advice right now is to break apart the team and either help them find non-ML roles internally or let them go.

In the end the org needs to be able to execute and this DS org sounds incompetent or ignorant or both. Go to the powers that be and point the problems out with documentation- use this to make the case for my previous (eg hire new head reporting to you) \n\n- in general adapt your approach to who you are dealing with. Some people are incompetent but they do not know this. Some lack even the humility to listen to others. Based on who you are dealing with, adapt. Identify people in the team that are open to feedback and learning. Speak to them. \n\n- Be careful not to over generalize- in my experience this type of issue mainly is due to management, which means you are probably best off hiring into your own org. \n\nGood luck!",

In the end, no matter what they do, if you get them to push their code into GIT nightly, the problem is largely mitigated. They will use personal computers and hide code everywhere.

This mentality and arrogance is burned into their psyche from college forward. Come down hard on them with policy and governance and don’t negotiate. This isn’t about teambuilding. It’s about the business owning the property they paid to develop. Fuck those scientists.",

          "text": "The labeling and training data fundamentals issue you mentioned is actually one of the most impactful places to start. In my experience, teams that struggle with deployment quality almost always have upstream data problems they never diagnosed.\n\nA practical approach: introduce a lightweight data quality review as a gate before any model training begins. This means documenting the labeling methodology, measuring inter-annotator agreement, tracking data provenance, and validating that the training distribution actually reflects production conditions. When teams are forced to answer basic questions like 'what is the label error rate in this dataset' or 'how was this training data sampled,' it naturally surfaces the gaps in their process without it feeling like a personal critique.\n\nThe documentation problem you describe often stems from teams building models in isolation from the data pipeline. Once you tie data quality metrics to deployment readiness criteria, the documentation becomes functional rather than performative. Teams start writing useful docs because they need them to pass their own gates, not because someone told them to.",

So this means build your classifier with your favorite algorithm, logistic, random-forest, xg-boost, whatever gives you a decent performance on a test set, recaliberate it - sklearn has isotonic regression and platt scaling, choose the one one that gives you the best result.\n\nPractically, in these kind of problems, you need to understand and determine the trade off between the false positive rate and the false negative rate. This is in relation to picking a threshold for classifying an example as a positive - 0.5 won't be optimal. In a marketing application, false positives may be one you control, in a health care setting (screening for a disease), a false negative is what you control.

When you undersample your majority class, you shift the base rate in your training data, so the raw predicted probabilities are no longer calibrated to the true population distribution. The standard correction is Platt scaling or the offset adjustment. For logistic regression: p\\_corrected = p\\_model / (p\\_model + (1 - p\\_model) \\* (beta\\_0 / beta\\_1)) where beta\\_0 is the negative class sampling rate and beta\\_1 is the positive class sampling rate. I'd also recommend calibration curves (sklearn.calibration.calibration\\_curve) before and after correction. Isotonic regression calibration works well if the relationship isn't cleanly monotonic. Watch out: if undersampling is aggressive (like 1:1 on a 99:1 problem), even the correction might not fully recover calibration at extremes. Consider SMOTE or a weighted loss function instead.",

As far as I see it, I don’t see a roadmap for automation of decisions as a result of AI, but there is a clear road to use DS and AI to recommend, facilitate, and create self serve data engines for HR leaders. I’m an IC though, not a manager.\n\nThe current path I see for 5 years is less human interaction needed to make data pulls/aggregations. More emphasis on creating generalizable tools that let HR leaders make all those decisions themselves without needed interaction from a DS. DS will likely focus on more complex experimentation and modeling.",

They can also do a lot more analysis and faster than before. However not everyone is qualified to interpret the data. 2) The workforce is changing at a rapid pace, and what skills used to matter (technical) don't matter as much with the help of AI but judgment and people skills are still in limited quantity. So HR has a critical role to play in rethinking how the workforce needs to evolve (hiring, training performance reviews....)",

I'm describing the whole task as it was described to me and then as I discovered it.\n\nUltimately, I'm here to ask you, **what do you do, and how long does it take you to do it?**\n\n\nI started a new role this month, I am new to advertising modeling methods like mmm, so I am reading a lot about how to apply the methods specific to mmm in R and python, I use VScode, I don't have a github copilot license, I get to use copilot through windows office license. Although this task did not involve modeling, I do want to ask about that kind of task another day if this goes over well.\n\n\n##### The task\n5, excel sheets are to be provided. You are told that this is a clients data that was given to another party for some other analysis and augmentation. This is a quality assurance task. The previous process was as follows;\n\n##### the data\n* the data structure: 1 workbook per industry for 5 industries\n* 4 workbooks had 1 tab, 1 workbook had 3 tabs\n* each tab had a table that had a date column in days, 2 categorical columns advertising_partner, line_of_business and at least 2 numeric columns per work book.\n* some times data is updated from our side and the partner has to redownload the data and reprocess and share again\n\n##### the process\n* this is done once per client, per quarter (but it's just this client for now)\n* open each workbook\n* navigate to each tab\n* the data is in a \"controllable\" table\n\n |   | | | | |\n---|---|---| ---|---|---|\nbing| bing | | |\nhome | home | | |\nimpressions | spend | | partner dropdown| line of business dropdown\n\n* where bing and home are controlled with drop down toggles, with a combination of 3-4 categories each.\n* compare with data that is to be downloaded from a tableau dashboard\n* end state: the comparison of the metrics in tableau to the excel tables to ensure that \"the numbers are the same\"\n* the categories presented map 1 to 1 with the data you have downloaded from tableau\n* aggregate the data in a pivot table, select the matching categories, make sure the values match\n\n\n\n#### additional info about the file\n*  the summary table is a complicated sumproduct look up table against an extremely wide table hidden to the left. the summary table can start as early as AK and as late as FE.\n* there are 2 broadly different formats of underlying data in the 5 notebooks, with small structure differences between the group of 3.\n\n###### in the group of 3\n* the structure of this wide table is similar to the summary table with categories in the column headers describing the metric below it. but with additional categories like region, which is the same value for every column header. 1 of these tables has 1 more header category than the other 2\n* the left most columns have 1 category each, there are 3 date columns for day, quarter.\n\n\n| | | | | | |\n|---|---|----|----| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| | | | \n| | REGION |  | USA | USA | USA\n| | PARTNER | | bing  | bing | google |\n| | LOB | | home | home | auto |\n|  |  |  | impressions | spend | ...etc|\n| date | quarter|  | impressions| spend | ...etc|\n| 2023-01-01 | q1|  | 1| 2 | ...etc |\n| 2023-01-02 | q1|  | 3| 4 | ...etc |\n\n\n###### in the group of 2\n\n* the left most categories are actually the categorical headers in the group of 3, and the metrics, the values in each category mach\n* the dates are now the headers of this very wide table\n* the header labels are separated from the start of the values by 1 column\n* there is an empty row immediately below the final row for column headers.\n\n\n| | | | | | | |\n|---|---|----|----| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| | | | date Label| | 2023-01-01 | 2023-01-02 |\n| | | | year| | 2023 | 2023 |\n| | | | quarter| | q1 | q1 | \n| blank row | | | | | | |\n| REGION | PARTNER | LOB | measure| | | |\n| blank row | | | | | | |\n| US | bing | home | impressions |  | 1 | 3| \n| US | bing | home | spend |  | 2 | 4 | \n| US | google | auto | ...etc | | ...etc | ... etc|\n\n\nThe question is, what do you do, and how long does it take you to do it?\n\nI am being honest here, I wrote out this explaination basically in the order in which I was introduced to the information and how I discovered it. *(Oh it's easy if it's all the same format even if it's weird, oh there are 2-ish different formatted files)*\n\nthe meeting of this task ended at 11:00AM. I saw this copy paste manual etl project and I simply didn't want to do it. So I outlined my task by identifying the elements of the table, column name ranges, value ranges, stacked / pivoted column ranges, etc... for an R script to extract that data. by passing the ranges of that content to an argument `make_clean_table(left_columns=\"B4:E4\", header_dims=c(..etc))` and functions that extract that convert that excel range into the correct position in the table to extract that element. Then the data was transformed to create a tidy long table.\n\nthe function gets passed once per notebook extracting the data from each worksheet, building a single table with the columns for the workbook industry, the category in the tab, partner, line of business, spend, impressions, etc...\n\nIMO; ideally (if I *have* to check their data in excel that is), I'd like the partner to redo their report so that I received a workbook with the underlying data in a traditionally tabular form and their reporting page to use power query and table references and not cell ranges and formula.",

The fact that they have two completely different formats mixed in there just screams \"someone cobbled this together over years without any standardization\"\n\n  \nFor time estimate, probably would've taken me a full day to write the R functions to handle both formats, especially with all those hidden columns and weird sumproduct lookups. The manual way they wanted? That's easily 2-3 days of mind-numbing work that you'd probably mess up anyway\n\n  \nYour suggestion about getting the partner to standardize their output is spot on - this whole setup feels like technical debt that everyone's just living with because \"that's how we've always done it\" 😂",

I would benefit most learning more data engineering or Tableau. Am also open to completely unrelated courses if you know any interesting ones.\n\nthanks :)",
