      "text": "**Background**\n\nDuring my PhD in Data Science at Stanford, I got sick and tired of ghost jobs & 3rd party offshore agencies on LinkedIn & Indeed. So I wrote a script that fetches jobs from 30k+ company websites' career pages and uses GPT4o-mini to extract relevant information (ex salary, remote, etc.) from job descriptions. You can use it here: ([HiringCafe](http://hiring.cafe)). Here is a filter for Data science jobs (5,335 and counting). I scrape every company 3x/day, so the results stay fresh if you check back the next day.\n\nYou can follow my progress on r/hiringcafe\n\n**How I built the HiringCafe (from a DS perspective)**\n\n1. I identified company career pages with active job listings. I used the [Apollo.io](http://apollo.io/) to search for companies across various industries, and get their company URLs. To narrow these down, I wrote a web crawler (using Node.js, and a combination of Cheerio + Puppeteer depending on site complexity) to find the career page of the company. I discovered that I could dump the raw HTML and prompt ChatGPT o1-mini to classify (as a binary classification) whether each page contained a job description or not. I thus compiled a list of verified job page if it contains a job description or not. If it contains a job description, I add it to a list and proceed to step 2\n2. Verifying legit companies. This part I had to do manually, but it was crucial that I exclude any recruiting firms, 3rd party offshore agencies, etc. because I wanted only high-quality companies directly hiring for roles at their firm. I manually sorted through the 30,000 company career pages (this took several weeks) and picked the ones that looked legit. At Stanford, we call this technique \"occular regression\" :) It was doable because I only had to verify each company a single time and then I trust it moving forward.\n3. Removing ghost jobs. I discovered that a strong predictor of if a job is a ghost job is that if it keeps being reposted. I was able to identify reposting by doing a embedding text similarity search for jobs from the same company. If 2 job descriptions overlap too much, I only show the date posted for the *earliest* listing. This allowed me to weed out most ghost jobs simply by using a date filter (for example, excluding any jobs posted over a month ago). In my anecdotal, experience this means that I get a higher response rate for data science jobs compared to LinkedIn or Indeed.\n4. Scraping fresh jobs 3x/day. To ensure that my database is reflective of the company career page, I check each company career page 3x/day. Many career pages do not have rate limits because it is in their best interest to allow web scrapers, which is great. For the few that do, I was able to use a rotating proxy. I use Oxylabs for now, but I've heard good things about ScraperAPI, Crawlera.\n5. Building advanced NLP text filters. After playing with GPT4o-mini API, I realized I could can effectively dump raw job descriptions (in HTML) and ask it to give me back formatted information back in JSON (ex salary, yoe, etc). I used this technique to extract a variety of information, including technical keywords, job industry, required licenses & security clearance, if the company sponsors visa, etc.\n6. Powerful search. Once I had the structured JSON data (containing salary, years of experience, remote status, job title, company name, location, and other relevant fields) from ChatGPT's extraction process, I needed a robust search engine to allow users to query and filter jobs efficiently. I chose Elasticsearch due to its powerful full-text search capabilities, filtering, and aggregation features. My favorite feature with Elasticsearch is that it allows me to do Boolean queries. For instance, I can search for job descriptions with technical keywords of \"Pandas\" or \"R\" (example link [here](https://hiring.cafe/?searchState=%7B%22technologyKeywordsQuery%22%3A%22%5C%22Pandas%5C%22+or+%5C%22R%5C%22+%22%7D)).\n\n# Question for the DS community here\n\nBeyond job search, one thing I'm really excited about this 2.1 million job dataset is to be able to do a yearly or quarterly trend report. For instance, to look at what technical skills are growing in demand. What kinds of cool job trends analyses would you do if you had access to this data.",

From an educators perspective job market and job posting are our upstream requirement but their quality is what you said - very volatile, written by HR instead of the teams, il outdated. Somebody must be evaluating the job market efficiency throu search times vs job description clarity... Wonder if your parsing pipeline can work for job posting in other locations and industry domains - would be so nice to have a snapshot of global jobs data from direct employees websites, eg skilled labour shortages in the Gulf, remote vs onsite work, etc",

I would be careful about raw skill frequency and focus instead on transitions, like which skills appear together over time and which ones replace others within similar role titles. Another angle is lead time, how long after a new tool or framework becomes visible in research or open source, does it start showing up in job requirements. you could also look at variance, not just means, for things like years of experience or salary bands to see where roles are becoming more standardized versus more ambiguous. One thing to watch is survivorship and posting bias, since companies that overhire or churn roles can distort trends if you do not normalize by employer behavior. Done carefully, this kind of data can say a lot about how the market actually digests new ideas rather than just reacting to hype.",

I was on Oxylabs too but switched because the pay-as-you-go model made more sense for bursty scraping workloads where you don't need proxies running 24/7. Their resi pool has been solid for the sites that block datacenter IPs.\n\nFor the trend analysis question - I'd look at how skill co-occurrence patterns shift over time. Like tracking when \"LLM\" started appearing alongside \"data engineering\" roles vs purely ML ones. That'd be way more interesting than raw keyword counts.",

Jobs will be posted for awards we anticipate, but those don’t always pan out. To solve for this, we have ‘greenfield’ job listings. You might be omitting these ‘greenfield’ jobs with your methodology to detect ‘ghost jobs.’ A greenfield job is an opening that is perpetually open. It represents a skill set we’re almost always hiring. And if we’re not hiring, we’re establishing relationships with candidates to hire in the future when we win work aligned to it.\n\nI know other consultancies use job templates for job postings. So even if they’re not posting ‘greenfield’ as we do (perpetually open), their postings all look the same because they’re built from the same template.\n\nMaybe these are the types of job postings you and others want excluded. But they do represent real job opportunities and sometimes people get hired ‘to the bench’ if they’re a great candidate even if a position isn’t immediately available.",

The $3-4k/month LLM cost for structuring alone shows how expensive cleaning messy data gets at scale.\n\n  \nFor those considering similar projects: worth evaluating compliant B2B data sources that already solve the normalization problem. Sometimes licensing pre-structured, validated datasets is more cost-effective than building the entire scraping → cleaning → structuring pipeline.\n\n  \nThe rotating proxy setup is smart for avoiding detection. Curious about your approach to data freshness validation - with 3x daily scrapes across 30k sites, how do you verify when job postings actually close vs. just go stale?\n\n  \nGreat documentation of the process.

When the goal is to accumulate profit, the work will always expand to fit the capacity of the working people. No \"labour-saving\" device will ever reduce work, it will only accelerate the exponential consumption of our planet's resources.",

Now there's this implicit pressure to have multiple workstreams going because the AI handles the grunt work. But the thinking work -- framing the right question, validating assumptions, communicating results to stakeholders -- that hasn't gotten faster at all. What I've found helpful is being very explicit with leadership about the difference between AI made step 3 faster and the entire project takes less time. Those are very different statements, and conflating them is exactly how workload creep sneaks in. Our team started doing weekly scope reviews specifically to catch scope creep disguised as efficiency gains and it's made a real difference.",

So you simultaneously have to treat them like a 5yo child to not lose them, while keeping in mind that they're also sharp af and underestimating them is dangerous.

So don’t just practice answering which model you’d use, but also think about how to communicate constraints, failure modes, trade-offs, etc.\n\nEssentially, don’t just rely on AI to generate answers. You still have to do the explaining and thinking yourself, and that requires deeper practice.\n\nI’m curious though how data science/analytics candidates are experiencing this. Has anything changed with your interview experience in light of AI? Have you adapted your interview prep to accommodate this shift (if any)?",

We were primarily acquired for our technical talent and some high growth ML products they see as a strategic threat. \n\nTheir ML team is entirely entry-level and struggling badly. They have very poor fundamentals around labeling training data, build systems without strong business cases, and ignore reasonable feedback from engineering partners regarding latency and safe deployment patterns. \n\nI am staff level MLE and have been asked to up level this team. I’ve tried the following:\n\n\\- Being inquisitive and asking them to explain design decisions \n\n\\- walking them through our systems and discussing the good/bad/ugly\n\n\\- being vulnerable about past decisions that were suboptimal\n\n\\- offering to provide feedback before design review with cross functional partners\n\nNone of this has worked. I am mostly ignored. When I point out something obvious (e.g 12 second latency is unacceptable for live inference) they claim there is no time to fix it. They write dozens of pages of documents that do not have answers to simple questions (what ML algorithms are you using? What data do you need at inference time? What systems rely on your responses).  They then claim no one is knowledgeable enough to understand their approach. It seems like when something doesn’t go their way they just stonewall and gaslight.\n\nI personally have never dealt with this before. I’m curious if anyone has coached a team to unlearn these behaviors and heal cross functional relationships.\n\nMy advice right now is to break apart the team and either help them find non-ML roles internally or let them go.

It can be easy to miss that a senior IC is actually in a quasi-management role, controls jobs, titles, etc. There's never an easy way to explain this to people, but if the quiet approach has failed, maybe meet with them as a group, explain that you've been empowered to fix some issues with the team, and that you need to see some specific changes.  \n\nPossible middle-ground to getting rid of them all is to set up some challenge projects. Clear goals that meet clear needs, with clear metrics. Assign to the local \"experts\". Give them support and time to execute. If they fail, they go. \n\nAll that said, if you're allowed to get rid of them all and can quickly replace the team, just do it. They're dumb enough to fail to realize that you're in control of their future and lazy/stupid enough to fail to listen to you and adapt.

Some people are incompetent but they do not know this. Some lack even the humility to listen to others. Based on who you are dealing with, adapt. Identify people in the team that are open to feedback and learning.

In my experience, teams that struggle with deployment quality almost always have upstream data problems they never diagnosed.\n\nA practical approach: introduce a lightweight data quality review as a gate before any model training begins. This means documenting the labeling methodology, measuring inter-annotator agreement, tracking data provenance, and validating that the training distribution actually reflects production conditions. When teams are forced to answer basic questions like 'what is the label error rate in this dataset' or 'how was this training data sampled,' it naturally surfaces the gaps in their process without it feeling like a personal critique.\n\nThe documentation problem you describe often stems from teams building models in isolation from the data pipeline. Once you tie data quality metrics to deployment readiness criteria, the documentation becomes functional rather than performative. Teams start writing useful docs because they need them to pass their own gates, not because someone told them to.",

(3) The behavioral round matters more than people think. Use STAR format and have 2-3 stories about cross-functional influence and handling ambiguity. (4) For experimentation, know interference effects, ratio vs. non-ratio metrics, and when you'd choose something other than a standard A/B test.

So this means build your classifier with your favorite algorithm, logistic, random-forest, xg-boost, whatever gives you a decent performance on a test set, recaliberate it - sklearn has isotonic regression and platt scaling, choose the one one that gives you the best result.\n\nPractically, in these kind of problems, you need to understand and determine the trade off between the false positive rate and the false negative rate. This is in relation to picking a threshold for classifying an example as a positive - 0.5 won't be optimal. In a marketing application, false positives may be one you control, in a health care setting (screening for a disease), a false negative is what you control.

When you undersample your majority class, you shift the base rate in your training data, so the raw predicted probabilities are no longer calibrated to the true population distribution.

For logistic regression: p\\_corrected = p\\_model / (p\\_model + (1 - p\\_model) \\* (beta\\_0 / beta\\_1)) where beta\\_0 is the negative class sampling rate and beta\\_1 is the positive class sampling rate. I'd also recommend calibration curves (sklearn.calibration.calibration\\_curve) before and after correction. Isotonic regression calibration works well if the relationship isn't cleanly monotonic. Watch out: if undersampling is aggressive (like 1:1 on a 99:1 problem), even the correction might not fully recover calibration at extremes. Consider SMOTE or a weighted loss function instead.",

      "text": "Hi all — I’m looking for advice on the best retraining strategy for a multi-class classifier in a setting where the label space can evolve. Right now I have about 6 labels, but I don’t know how many will show up over time, and some labels appear inconsistently or disappear for long stretches. My initial labeled dataset is \\~6,000 rows and it’s extremely imbalanced: one class dominates and the smallest class has only a single example. New data keeps coming in, and my boss wants us to retrain using the model’s inferences plus the human corrections made afterward by someone with domain knowledge. I have concerns about retraining on inferences, but that's a different story.\n\nGiven this setup, should retraining typically use all accumulated labeled data, a sliding window of recent data, or something like a recent window plus a replay buffer for rare but important classes? Would incremental/online learning (e.g., partial\\_fit style updates or stream-learning libraries) help here, or is periodic full retraining generally safer with this kind of label churn and imbalance? I’d really appreciate any recommendations on a robust policy that won’t collapse into the dominant class, plus how you’d evaluate it (e.g., fixed “golden” test set vs rolling test, per-class metrics) when new labels can appear.",

This creates a feedback loop where the model's existing biases get amplified with each cycle, especially for rare classes. The safest approach for your setup is periodic full retrains on all human-verified labeled data, with a replay buffer strategy for rare classes.\n\nFor the evolving label space specifically, maintain a curated data store where every label has a minimum representation threshold. When a new class appears with only a handful of examples, flag it for active human labeling rather than letting the model learn from its own uncertain predictions. Track data provenance so you always know which labels came from human annotators versus model inferences that were corrected.\n\nFor evaluation with shifting classes, keep a fixed golden test set but version it. When new classes emerge, create a new golden set version that includes them while preserving the old one for regression testing. Use per-class precision and recall alongside macro-F1 so you can catch when the model starts ignoring rare classes. The dominant class hiding failures in aggregate metrics is the most common silent failure mode in production ML systems with imbalanced data.",

The previous process was as follows;\n\n##### the data\n* the data structure: 1 workbook per industry for 5 industries\n* 4 workbooks had 1 tab, 1 workbook had 3 tabs\n* each tab had a table that had a date column in days, 2 categorical columns advertising_partner, line_of_business and at least 2 numeric columns per work book.\n* some times data is updated from our side and the partner has to redownload the data and reprocess and share again\n\n##### the process\n* this is done once per client, per quarter (but it's just this client for now)\n* open each workbook\n* navigate to each tab\n* the data is in a \"controllable\" table\n\n |   | | | | |\n---|---|---| ---|---|---|\nbing| bing | | |\nhome | home | | |\nimpressions | spend | | partner dropdown| line of business dropdown\n\n* where bing and home are controlled with drop down toggles, with a combination of 3-4 categories each.\n* compare with data that is to be downloaded from a tableau dashboard\n* end state: the comparison of the metrics in tableau to the excel tables to ensure that \"the numbers are the same\"\n* the categories presented map 1 to 1 with the data you have downloaded from tableau\n* aggregate the data in a pivot table, select the matching categories, make sure the values match\n\n\n\n#### additional info about the file\n*  the summary table is a complicated sumproduct look up table against an extremely wide table hidden to the left. the summary table can start as early as AK and as late as FE.\n* there are 2 broadly different formats of underlying data in the 5 notebooks, with small structure differences between the group of 3.\n\n###### in the group of 3\n* the structure of this wide table is similar to the summary table with categories in the column headers describing the metric below it. but with additional categories like region, which is the same value for every column header. 1 of these tables has 1 more header category than the other 2\n* the left most columns have 1 category each, there are 3 date columns for day, quarter.\n\n\n| | | | | | |\n|---|---|----|----| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| | | | \n| | REGION |  | USA | USA | USA\n| | PARTNER | | bing  | bing | google |\n| | LOB | | home | home | auto |\n|  |  |  | impressions | spend | ...etc|\n| date | quarter|  | impressions| spend | ...etc|\n| 2023-01-01 | q1|  | 1| 2 | ...etc |\n| 2023-01-02 | q1|  | 3| 4 | ...etc |\n\n\n###### in the group of 2\n\n* the left most categories are actually the categorical headers in the group of 3, and the metrics, the values in each category mach\n* the dates are now the headers of this very wide table\n* the header labels are separated from the start of the values by 1 column\n* there is an empty row immediately below the final row for column headers.\n\n\n| | | | | | | |\n|---|---|----|----| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| | | | date Label| | 2023-01-01 | 2023-01-02 |\n| | | | year| | 2023 | 2023 |\n| | | | quarter| | q1 | q1 | \n| blank row | | | | | | |\n| REGION | PARTNER | LOB | measure| | | |\n| blank row | | | | | | |\n| US | bing | home | impressions |  | 1 | 3| \n| US | bing | home | spend |  | 2 | 4 | \n| US | google | auto | ...etc | | ...etc | ... etc|\n\n\nThe question is, what do you do, and how long does it take you to do it?\n\nI am being honest here, I wrote out this explaination basically in the order in which I was introduced to the information and how I discovered it. *(Oh it's easy if it's all the same format even if it's weird, oh there are 2-ish different formatted files)*\n\nthe meeting of this task ended at 11:00AM. I saw this copy paste manual etl project and I simply didn't want to do it. So I outlined my task by identifying the elements of the table, column name ranges, value ranges, stacked / pivoted column ranges, etc... for an R script to extract that data. by passing the ranges of that content to an argument `make_clean_table(left_columns=\"B4:E4\", header_dims=c(..etc))` and functions that extract that convert that excel range into the correct position in the table to extract that element. Then the data was transformed to create a tidy long table.\n\nthe function gets passed once per notebook extracting the data from each worksheet, building a single table with the columns for the workbook industry, the category in the tab, partner, line of business, spend, impressions, etc...\n\nIMO; ideally (if I *have* to check their data in excel that is), I'd like the partner to redo their report so that I received a workbook with the underlying data in a traditionally tabular form and their reporting page to use power query and table references and not cell ranges and formula.",

The fact that they have two completely different formats mixed in there just screams \"someone cobbled this together over years without any standardization\"\n\n  \nFor time estimate, probably would've taken me a full day to write the R functions to handle both formats, especially with all those hidden columns and weird sumproduct lookups. The manual way they wanted? That's easily 2-3 days of mind-numbing work that you'd probably mess up anyway\n\n  \nYour suggestion about getting the partner to standardize their output is spot on - this whole setup feels like technical debt that everyone's just living with because \"that's how we've always done it\" 😂",
