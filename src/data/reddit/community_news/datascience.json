      "text": "**Background**\n\nDuring my PhD in Data Science at Stanford, I got sick and tired of ghost jobs & 3rd party offshore agencies on LinkedIn & Indeed. So I wrote a script that fetches jobs from 30k+ company websites' career pages and uses GPT4o-mini to extract relevant information (ex salary, remote, etc.) from job descriptions. You can use it here: ([HiringCafe](http://hiring.cafe)). Here is a filter for Data science jobs (5,335 and counting). I scrape every company 3x/day, so the results stay fresh if you check back the next day.\n\nYou can follow my progress on r/hiringcafe\n\n**How I built the HiringCafe (from a DS perspective)**\n\n1. I identified company career pages with active job listings. I used the [Apollo.io](http://apollo.io/) to search for companies across various industries, and get their company URLs. To narrow these down, I wrote a web crawler (using Node.js, and a combination of Cheerio + Puppeteer depending on site complexity) to find the career page of the company. I discovered that I could dump the raw HTML and prompt ChatGPT o1-mini to classify (as a binary classification) whether each page contained a job description or not. I thus compiled a list of verified job page if it contains a job description or not. If it contains a job description, I add it to a list and proceed to step 2\n2. Verifying legit companies. This part I had to do manually, but it was crucial that I exclude any recruiting firms, 3rd party offshore agencies, etc. because I wanted only high-quality companies directly hiring for roles at their firm. I manually sorted through the 30,000 company career pages (this took several weeks) and picked the ones that looked legit. At Stanford, we call this technique \"occular regression\" :) It was doable because I only had to verify each company a single time and then I trust it moving forward.\n3. Removing ghost jobs. I discovered that a strong predictor of if a job is a ghost job is that if it keeps being reposted. I was able to identify reposting by doing a embedding text similarity search for jobs from the same company. If 2 job descriptions overlap too much, I only show the date posted for the *earliest* listing. This allowed me to weed out most ghost jobs simply by using a date filter (for example, excluding any jobs posted over a month ago). In my anecdotal, experience this means that I get a higher response rate for data science jobs compared to LinkedIn or Indeed.\n4. Scraping fresh jobs 3x/day. To ensure that my database is reflective of the company career page, I check each company career page 3x/day. Many career pages do not have rate limits because it is in their best interest to allow web scrapers, which is great. For the few that do, I was able to use a rotating proxy. I use Oxylabs for now, but I've heard good things about ScraperAPI, Crawlera.\n5. Building advanced NLP text filters. After playing with GPT4o-mini API, I realized I could can effectively dump raw job descriptions (in HTML) and ask it to give me back formatted information back in JSON (ex salary, yoe, etc). I used this technique to extract a variety of information, including technical keywords, job industry, required licenses & security clearance, if the company sponsors visa, etc.\n6. Powerful search. Once I had the structured JSON data (containing salary, years of experience, remote status, job title, company name, location, and other relevant fields) from ChatGPT's extraction process, I needed a robust search engine to allow users to query and filter jobs efficiently. I chose Elasticsearch due to its powerful full-text search capabilities, filtering, and aggregation features. My favorite feature with Elasticsearch is that it allows me to do Boolean queries. For instance, I can search for job descriptions with technical keywords of \"Pandas\" or \"R\" (example link [here](https://hiring.cafe/?searchState=%7B%22technologyKeywordsQuery%22%3A%22%5C%22Pandas%5C%22+or+%5C%22R%5C%22+%22%7D)).\n\n# Question for the DS community here\n\nBeyond job search, one thing I'm really excited about this 2.1 million job dataset is to be able to do a yearly or quarterly trend report. For instance, to look at what technical skills are growing in demand. What kinds of cool job trends analyses would you do if you had access to this data.",

          "text": "The dataset is interesting less for counts and more for longitudinal signals. I would be careful about raw skill frequency and focus instead on transitions, like which skills appear together over time and which ones replace others within similar role titles. Another angle is lead time, how long after a new tool or framework becomes visible in research or open source, does it start showing up in job requirements. you could also look at variance, not just means, for things like years of experience or salary bands to see where roles are becoming more standardized versus more ambiguous. One thing to watch is survivorship and posting bias, since companies that overhire or churn roles can distort trends if you do not normalize by employer behavior. Done carefully, this kind of data can say a lot about how the market actually digests new ideas rather than just reacting to hype.",

As u/Monolikma says, sourcing is a key challenge…but I’d go one step farther and say quality, viable sourcing.  \n\nFrom the company perspective that means finding good, ready-to-hire candidates (not just a ton of applicants).  From the candidate perspective that means finding a role you’d like and have a good chance of getting hired (not just decent keyword matching).\n\nTo my thinking there are a few directions you could go with this, depending on the problem you want to solve.  Some example include:\n\n(1) Writing better job recs (on multiple fronts)\n(2) Improved candidate matching and prescreening\n(3) Guiding built/buy/borrow talent decisions\n\nHR tech companies like SAP, Workday, Oracle and niche providers are trying to solve these but haven’t been able to crack the code.  I’ve done collaborations with them at a few large consulting firms where I’ve worked.  Happy to share those stories if you’d find that constructive.\n\nLove what you’re doing.  It’s similar to a concept I put on the shelf a year ago because I couldn’t figure out how to source and process some of this data.\n\nI’d love to connect directly and riff on ideas, if you’re open to it.",

A generalist, one might say. \n\nI am looking for new jobs but all I get calls are for Gen AI. But their JD mentions other stuff - Relational DBs, Cloud, Standard ML toolkit...you get it. So, I had assumed GenAI would not be the primary requirement, but something like good-to-have.\n\nBut upon facing the interview, it turns out, **these are GenAI developer roles** that require heavily technical and training of LLM models. Oh, these are all API calling companies, not R&D.\n\nClearly, I am not a good fit. But I am unable to get roles/calls in standard business facing data science roles. This kind of indicates the following things:\n\n1. Gen AI is wayyy too much in demand, inspite of all the AI Hype.\n2. The DS boom in last decade has an oversupply of generalists like me, thus standard roles are saturated.\n\n**I would like to know your opinions and definitely can use some advice.**\n\n**Note**: The experience is APAC-specific.

All while hoping AI is the panacea for the problems they don’t want to understand.",

I haven't seen thus far how LLMs/LLM agentic frameworks have directly translated to increasing revenue in any significant capacity - meaning that it optimizes processes and saves time, but if your business model isn't putting an app out it's a lot of time invested for an unknown ROI.

Or worse, comments that say “this stuff isn’t AI, AI is like \\*insert sci-fi reference\\*.” And this is just comments on very high-level topics. If these views are not just being expressed, but are widely upvoted, I can’t help but think this sub is being infiltrated by laypeople without any background in this field and watering down the views of the knowledgeable DS community. I’m wondering if others are feeling this way.\n\nEdits to address some common replies:\n\n* I misspoke about \"the technical definition\" of AI. As others have pointed out, there is no single accepted definition for artificial intelligence.\n* It  is widely accepted in the field that machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\n   * In the 4th Edition of Russell and Norvig's Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (one of the, if not the, most popular academic texts on the topic) states\n\n>In the public eye, there is sometimes confusion between the terms “artificial intelligence” and “machine learning.” Machine learning is a subfield of AI that studies the ability to improve performance based on experience. Some AI systems use machine learning methods to achieve competence, but some do not.\n\n* My point isn't that everyone who visits this community should know this information. Newcomers and outsiders should be welcome. Comments such as \"LLMs aren’t AI\" indicate that people are confidently posting views that directly contradict widely accepted views within the field. If such easily refutable claims are being confidently shared and upvoted, that indicates to me that more nuanced conversations in this community may be driven by confident yet uninformed opinions. None of us are experts in everything, and, when reading about a topic I don't know much about, I have to trust that others in that conversation are informed. If this community is the blind leading the blind, it is completely worthless.",

Or linear regression for that matter, which is basically primitive ML.\n\nNot sure it has always been the case that ML was considered AI though. At least during my time doing this stuff, I feel like that AI being an umbrella term encompassing ML was a defined post hoc; these categories, terms and definitions were trying to describe new conceptual evolutions of what has already existed but were thought of differently in a differently conceptualized landscape.\n\nCuz then and now, the fundamental tech behind ML and what we call AI is still statistical learning, optimizations of some statistical functions, just brought to extreme depth and complexity. But the branding — both how we talk and think of the field and its potential in the bigger picture — has evolved.\n\nSo my recollection was that the idea of what is AI concretized (to some extent) when it was sorta layered on top of ML once neural networks started to show real usefulness and captured wider public attention/lay practitioner interest. Both terms have been around for a long time but I feel like the definition of AI was very nebulous and defined on more of a philosophical basis (which sci-fi has a lot to do with) rather than in terms of actual technology that hadn't yet existed or yet been associated with AI, until neural networks — with their artificial brain connotations — brought the AI term into what was the ML landscape, which was already pretty clearly defined in technical/real terms.\n\nWhat we previously thought of as statistical machines, essentially just applied statistics, was rebranded as part of the AI field because it was rethought of as part of that bigger picture ever since we landed on a more concrete idea of what AI is (no longer magic but a big complex statistical learning-based machine, with epistemological questions put aside such as whether machines \"really\" understand like humans do).\n\nTbh, when I think about AI, I still feel cognitive dissonance sometimes between the philosophical idea of AI and the umbrella we currently call AI technology.",

Machine learning is a subsect of AI, any ML model is considered AI. Whether people say ML/AI/whatever is a separate thing that’s always been changing, but no one was ever arguing that it’s not AI, in fact professionals were actively taught that it is.\n\nAlso, it’s funny when you say “in the traditional sense” because it’s the opposite that’s the case. Traditionally, these things were all originally AI. Even the most simplistic statistical models were considered AI back in the past. As more advanced models come out, those models start being called AI, and we start referring to the older/simpler models as something else. In the traditional sense, all of these models were AI and it’s revisionist to act as if traditionally it was only reserved for whatever you consider to be AI. People might only refer to the newest models as AI, but no one was ever arguing that the older models weren’t AI.\n\nIt seems to me that since LLMs blew up, you’ve got a large mix of people becoming more interested in AI/ML/DL/DS. Most of which are mainly hobbyists or those aspiring to work in or study in this field, but crucially none of them have any actual formal education on the matter.

It's a fairly well defined term, but it's not describing the same thing as what a lot of people want it to describe, which is some notion of an artificial mind. Additionally, digital minds are mostly the domain of fiction and philosophy, not data science. \n\nIt's also a large domain of crank science, which I suspect is why OP has a fairly strong reaction to seeing it. If your question of \"is this true AI\" is a form of \"is this some artificial being\" then it might as well be \"does this unit have a soul\".

None of us are experts in everything, and, when reading about a topic I don't know much about, I have to trust that others in that conversation are informed. If this community is the blind leading the blind, it is completely worthless to me.",

One theme across examples of models generating millions in revenue is they are all *predictive* algorithms: taking the output of a prediction and making decisions at scale with those results.\n\nBackwards variable selection has plenty of shortcomings as a *predictive* model selection method, but in the context of models generating revenue, the downsides are mainly opportunity costs of using that vs any other model specification where there might be diminishing returns to continuing to tinker.\n\nWhere criticisms of backwards variable selection really get loud is in its use for *inferential* modeling. That's where your p-values won't mean what you think they mean, your confidence intervals won't meet nominal coverage, and basically any kind of hypothesis testing or estimation isn't going to perform as intended. So, that is to say, if you were using backwards variable selection to do something like understand which customer attributes are most influential in predicting lifetime value and then storytell about those and design business strategies to do ~something~ with those attributes, you might have been pretty misled by this approach, both in which variables were selected and what those relative impacts were.",

This means the researcher begins with a belief that a specific relationship exists between a set of variables and an outcome of interest, and then uses a model to evaluate whether the data support that belief. For example, a researcher might hypothesize that a medication reduces the likelihood of a particular disease and fit a model to test this relationship. If the analysis shows no effect, the hypothesis is not supported. In this context, models are theory-driven and primarily used for inference, that is, understanding whether and how variables are related.\n\nIn industry, the primary goal is often different. Rather than focusing on causal relationships, practitioners are typically more concerned with maximizing predictive accuracy. From this perspective, a model created through backward elimination is data-driven rather than theory-driven: variables are retained or removed based on how well they improve prediction, not on whether they align with an existing theoretical framework. As a result, the final model may or may not be interpretable from a theoretical standpoint.",

Everything I said makes \"no sense\"?\n\n\nIf you really want to have good-faith conversation you do not need to be bombastic or obnoxious.\n\n\nHere ill help you out.\n\n\nYou are correct that in addition to what I said, a further consideration is model overfitting. This concern is directly relevant to my original post that differentiates academia vs industry.\n\n\nIn academia because your model is based on theory, and you put forward a hypothesis, you know the variables you will be testing ahead of time. This makes it possible to plan the study, sample size, and to even simulate results ahead of time. This does not make overfitting impossible but it makes it far less likely as you will know the hypothesis, and as a result, the model you will run a-priori to data collection, leaving you open to prepare the study accordingly.\n\n\nIn industry, it is exactly because models are often data-driven that overfitting is a bigger concern. You do not know what your model will look like before the data is collected, as, by definition techniques like backward elimination are data-driven. Because you cannot anticipate your model, you therefore are limited in your ability to prepare, and you run a greater risk of an overfit model coming up.\n\n\nNotice how in reconciling our posts to I did not need to imply that you obviously must know nothing and instead can skip that step in favor of discussing how the two different perspecrives we brought are both relevant. ",

I could certainly be wrong here, and an imperfect model that does its job well may still be very valuable.\n\nOn the otherhand, Harrel's work is all about causal inference in clinical trials and biostats. In that setting, you care much more about selecting covariates (features) that causally relevant for your design and not just those that are related at p < .05 to your outcome. See for example the literature on the dangers of controlling for post treatment variables.\n\nOn the otherhand, maybe you have a bunch of potential predictors for your model that you need to dwindle down to a manageable number in a data driven way. In that case, backward selection makes sense from an ease of use standpoint, although you could try LASSO or post double selection LASSO with the caveat that they dont always pick alot of variables. \n\nIn academia, I would never use backward selection unless there was a really specific and good reason for doing so. But most of my work doesnt involve prediction,  it involves more causal questions for which the acceptablity of that method for variable selection is low.\n\nAs an anecdote, in my policy masters I was taught all about forward and backward selection while it has not come up once in all the methods classes I took in my PhD.",

I also agree with another comment here that it’s very company-dependent. There are large, mature companies where experimentation is core to the business, Uber being a good example, and those roles can be very well compensated.\n\nThat said, I do enjoy the decision-making side of the work, and I’m getting the opportunity to move into this space now, even without deep hands-on experience yet.

EDA, bespoke models, etc. need the infrastructure, software engineering, and ops skills that MLEs bring to the table so that DS/applied researchers/whatever can focus on their strengths. I've had the MLE and related titles since the beginning of 2018 (before that was more traditional enterprise SWE and DE) and it's always been to support teams doing their own EDA and building their own models, a good chunk of it being in computer vision but also more traditional ML work.",

I don't have a strong opinion on whether one will change more drastically than the other, but I would hazard a guess they'll be impacted to similar degrees.\n\n2. Within the same company, ML roles will pay at least as well as product data science, and usually better. However, product data science at a top-paying company pays much better than ML at an average-paying company, so if you have a more differentiated advantage in experimentation and causal inference, that can still be the better-paying path in the long term.\n\n3. On-call is more likely if you're responsible for serving ML models in production, though that won't always be the case. Data science can have busier periods around big product releases and the like, but pages in the middle of the night are rare.\n\n4. Generally data science, though at many companies data teams aren't as influential as we might like them to be. Obviously there are still really important strategic elements to leading ML teams, but they tend to be distinct from the overall company strategy unless the ML models are core to the company's product.\n\nI think the main difference in practice is just how you spend your time on a day-to-day basis. Yes you're writing code and building models in both roles, but deploying and hardening a model at scale in production vs. developing an ad-hoc model and presenting the results to support a business decision are pretty different workflows.",

It is what I am doing these days as well, as I wanted to move away from all the hype. I just don’t deal with hype too well.\n\nI personally consider causal inference harder because, as others said, there is no ground truth. For example, in marketing, you run experiments, but they are often messy, so many things can happen alongside your experimental changes, and your synthetic counterfactuals may misbehave because some control units decided to go rogue. It’s much richer than “let me check if this model satisfies an accuracy of X”. It is as if you were playing with a dice and trying to determine its statistics, except that the dice is quite volatile and its faces change over time, so we don’t even know if the statistics are truly meaningful no matter how rigorous you try to be.\n\nI find any other type of ML, including GenAI, pretty tame compared to this. If anything, I wish more people realized that these image and language problems are in fact easy because the input-output relationship is relatively stable, and most/all of the signal you need is guaranteed to be in your data. This is just not true in causal inference problems.",

But that said, the inherent political and operational complexities make me think this area will generally have more staying power in the data science job market compared to more ML-oriented work as AI evolves and scales.

They often want to see clean data handling, reasonable feature choices, and the ability to explain trade offs as you go. In practice, people get tripped up on evaluation, like leaking data or picking a metric without thinking about what it implies. I’d also be ready to talk through decisions out loud, especially what you would change with more time or data. the signal is often whether this looks like something that could ship, not whether the model is fancy.",

          "text": "This kind of role can be a good learning experience, but the risk is less about demand forecasting itself and more about operating without technical cover. Being the only person defining scope, methods, and success criteria often means you end up doing ad hoc analytics under the banner of ML. That can be fine for a coop if expectations are clear, but it becomes stressful when accountability is high and guidance is low. I would try to understand how they define success for this project and who signs off on decisions informed by your work. If there is no one with enough depth to challenge assumptions, rigor tends to get traded for speed without anyone noticing. the title matters less than whether the work ships and whether you can point to concrete decisions your work influenced. If those pieces are fuzzy, your fear is pretty reasonable.",

      "text": "Hi all — I’m looking for advice on the best retraining strategy for a multi-class classifier in a setting where the label space can evolve. Right now I have about 6 labels, but I don’t know how many will show up over time, and some labels appear inconsistently or disappear for long stretches. My initial labeled dataset is \\~6,000 rows and it’s extremely imbalanced: one class dominates and the smallest class has only a single example. New data keeps coming in, and my boss wants us to retrain using the model’s inferences plus the human corrections made afterward by someone with domain knowledge. I have concerns about retraining on inferences, but that's a different story.\n\nGiven this setup, should retraining typically use all accumulated labeled data, a sliding window of recent data, or something like a recent window plus a replay buffer for rare but important classes? Would incremental/online learning (e.g., partial\\_fit style updates or stream-learning libraries) help here, or is periodic full retraining generally safer with this kind of label churn and imbalance? I’d really appreciate any recommendations on a robust policy that won’t collapse into the dominant class, plus how you’d evaluate it (e.g., fixed “golden” test set vs rolling test, per-class metrics) when new labels can appear.",

Here’s the 2nd post on best practices how to make data cleaning less painful and tedious.\n\n# Data cleaning is a loop\n\nMost real projects follow the same cycle:\n\n**Discovery → Investigation → Resolution**\n\nExample (e-commerce): you see random revenue spikes and a model that predicts “too well.” You inspect spike days, find duplicate orders, talk to the payment team, learn they retry events on timeouts, and ingestion sometimes records both. You then dedupe using an event ID (or keep latest status) and add a flag like collapsed\\_from\\_retries for traceability.\n\nIt’s a loop because you rarely uncover all issues upfront.\n\n# When it becomes slow and painful\n\n* Late / incomplete discovery: you fix one issue, then hit another later, rerun everything, repeat.\n* Cross-team dependency: business and IT don’t prioritize “weird data” until you show impact.\n* Context loss: long cycles, team rotation, meetings, and you end up re-explaining the same story.\n\n# Best practices that actually help\n\n**1) Improve Discovery (find issues earlier)**\n\nTwo common misconceptions:\n\n* exploration isn’t just describe() and null rates, it’s “does this behave like the real system?”\n* discovery isn’t only the data team’s job, you need business/system owners to validate what’s plausible\n\nA simple repeatable approach:\n\n* quick first pass (formats, samples, basic stats)\n* write a small list of **project-critical assumptions** (e.g., “1 row = 1 order”, “timestamps are UTC”)\n* test assumptions with targeted checks\n* validate fast with the people who own the system\n\n**2) Make Investigation manageable**\n\nTreat anomalies like product work:\n\n* prioritize by **impact vs cost** (with the people who will help you).\n* frame issues as outcomes, not complaints (“if we fix this, the churn model improves”)\n* track a small backlog: observation → hypothesis → owner → expected impact → effort\n\n**3) Resolution without destroying signals**\n\n* keep **raw data immutable** (cleaned data is an interpretation layer)\n* implement transformations **by issue** (e.g., resolve\\_gateway\\_retries()), not generic “cleaning steps”, not by column.\n* preserve uncertainty with flags (was\\_imputed, rejection reasons, dedupe indicators)\n\n**Bonus**: documentation is leverage (especially with AI tools)\n\nDon’t just document code. Document **assumptions and decisions** (“negative amounts are refunds, not errors”). Keep a short living “cleaning report” so the loop gets cheaper over time.",

It also manages endpoints and training jobs with composable, pipable commands following Unix philosophy.\n\n**Why it's useful:**\n\nTest your entire ML workflow locally before spending money on cloud resources. Commands are designed to be chained together, so you can automate common workflows like \"get latest training job → extract model → deploy endpoint\" in a single line.\n\nIt's experimental (APIs may change), requires Python 3.13+, and borrows heavily from [Sagify](https://github.com/Kenza-AI/sagify).
