I mainly work on SQL, Pandas, Power BI dashboards, credit risk modeling, MLOps, and a small part of GenAI architecture using Redis workers.\n\nI have been invited to my college, where I completed my Masters in Data Science, to give a guest lecture in the first week of March. I chose the topic “end to end ML building” where I plan to talk about:\n\n* Data validation using pandera\n* Feature store\n* Model training\n* Model serving using fastapi\n* Automation using airflow\n* Model monitoring\n* Containerization using docker\n\nI am comfortable teaching this because I use many of these tools at work and in personal projects.\n\nHowever, I am worried about one thing. Students may ask me about AI replacing jobs. They will graduate next year and they might ask:\n\n* Will there still be jobs?\n* Will our skills still be valuable?\n* Is AI removing entry level roles?\n\nEven I sometimes feel uncertain. Tools like claude and other AI systems are becoming very powerful. I am trying to learn advanced skills like production ML pipelines to stay relevant. hoping these harder skills will keep me relevant longer.\n\nBut I am not sure how to confidently answer students when they ask about job security. i don't want to scare them.\n\nI need guidance on what I should tell them about the future of AI and jobs.",

I think a lot of the work you might present is moving to MLE which, not only is not a first job, it requires SWE skills. \n\nI disagree with telling them to focus on \"advanced skills such as building an end-to-end system\". I think that: \n\n(1) There are many types of roles (DA, DS, MLE), areas out there (Product, Growth, Go to Market), industries (tech, finance, healthcare, etc.) They need to find what's the best fit for them. \n\n(2) Many of the \"advanced skills\" roles are being taken by SWE. Also, I've been interviewing a lot and companies that ask about anything for deploying models, etc., are start-ups. They also have take homes and if you move beyond that, like bigger companies, they call the role MLE. These roles are very difficult to get and they require a lot of prep for system design interviews. I wouldn't recommend this for people who are finishing a masters in DS unless they come from SWE. \n\nThat said, yes, having skills helps get you to the door, but even in full stack DS interviews they are going to ask you fro basic python/SQL coding interview, product sense, etc. in interviews. So spending hours and hours on a project and investing in the skills you mentioned is kind of a waste. They should be preparing for interviews first and if they have no business or product sense, they are not going to pass any interview screening.\n\nMy advice would (1), to find what they are a good fit for and have a coherent resume. Not sell themselves as someone who can do everything and anything. \n\n",

Legally only a human can be responsible for the output at the moment.\n\nI still see plenty of jobs for people who understands and can descibe what they want. Humans still needs to give context and have a vision of the output.\n\nSo less focus on coding but still relevant to have the right background/experiance.\n\nMy background is in Chemical engineering and now I work with a mix of data analysis/science and change management.

Education puts you on rails, but the market simply sends signals to solutions you give it.\n\nThe question is asking, is DS still a solution that's valued? The answer was always \"yes\" because we live in an online world and undertstanding data is the only way to navigate it. Data are difficult to interpret and so you will need people who can do that.\n\n10 years ago, if you could fit a model then that was enough to enter the field, that's still valued, but there are other skills like being able to select metrics, diagnose dashboard changes, set up experiments, influence roadmaps with recommendations over what to build next and so on.\n\nThere's a bunch of research that says that AI is having an impact, but there are other economic factors at play as well. It's never easy to start your career and it's definitely more challenging than ever but there's also more information and strategy to do so than ever as well.\n\nYes, it's worth being anxious about, but the solution to anxiety is being able to create a strategy strong enough to get you through the challenges ahead. If you're in a position where you're asking someone else \"will it be okay\" then the problem is that you're not thinking for yourself yet, which is what's most important in the first place.",

                  "text": "I was totally joking but thats is hilarious. It doesnt come across as AI slop at all and theres nothing wrong with usisng AI assisted communication. In the spirit of that, I asked two different LLMs the question in your post:\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.6:\n\n>This is a genuinely hard question, and the fact that you feel uncertain is actually a sign you're thinking about it honestly rather than just reciting talking points. Here's how I'd frame it.\n\n>**First, acknowledge the uncertainty openly.** Students will respect you more for saying \"I don't have a crystal ball\" than for being falsely reassuring. The honest answer is that nobody knows exactly how this plays out. But uncertainty isn't the same as doom.\n\n>**What you can say with confidence:**\n\n>The skills you're teaching them — data validation, feature stores, model serving, monitoring, pipelines — are precisely the skills that AI tools *cannot* replace easily right now, and likely won't for a while. Here's why: AI is very good at generating code snippets, answering questions, drafting dashboards. It is not good at understanding *why* a model is drifting in production, *why* your feature store is returning stale values, or *why* a credit risk model is behaving unexpectedly in a new market segment. Those require judgment built from real experience. That's what they're learning to develop.\n\n>**On entry-level roles specifically** — yes, some tasks that used to define entry-level jobs are being automated. This is real and worth acknowledging. But the historical pattern with technology is that it tends to shift what entry-level work *looks like* rather than eliminate the need for junior people entirely. Junior engineers in the 2000s spent a lot of time on tasks that are now trivial. Instead, they were pushed toward higher-leverage work earlier. The same shift is happening now. Entry-level data scientists will likely spend less time on boilerplate EDA and more time learning to evaluate model behavior, write good evals, and manage ML systems in production.\n\n>**The reframe you can offer them** — and that genuinely helped me think about this — is that AI is raising the floor of what a capable person can produce, but it's also raising the bar for what's expected. Someone who uses AI tools effectively and understands production ML systems is more valuable than someone who can only write clean notebooks. The students in that room, graduating with exposure to MLOps concepts, are already positioning themselves better than most.\n\n>**Your own story is the most powerful thing you can share.** You're two years in, you felt the uncertainty too, and your response was to go deeper into production skills that require real judgment. That's the right instinct, and you can tell them that directly. Not as a guarantee, but as a strategy: go toward the harder, more contextual, more production-oriented skills because those are the ones that require the kind of situated understanding that's harder to automate.\n\n>**One practical thing to tell them:** Learn to use AI tools fluently *as part of* building these pipelines. A data scientist who can use Claude or Copilot to accelerate their work while still understanding what's happening under the hood is significantly more productive than one who can't. That combination — tool fluency plus genuine systems understanding — is what you want to be.\n\n>The honest summary you could close with: *\"I can't promise you job security. Nobody can. What I can tell you is that the people I see thriving are the ones who go deeper on systems-level thinking and learn to work with AI rather than feel threatened by it. That's what I'm trying to do, and it's part of why I'm teaching you these topics today.\"*\n\n>That's more credible than false confidence, and it's also true.\n\nand ChatGPT (free version)\n\nFirst of all — congratulations. Getting invited back within \\~2 years of graduating means you’re already doing something right.\n\nNow let’s talk about the *real* concern.\n\nYou’re not worried about the technical content.  \nYou’re worried about standing in front of students and being asked:\n\n* “Will there still be jobs?”\n* “Is AI replacing us?”\n* “Are entry-level roles disappearing?”\n* “Are we learning things that will become irrelevant?”\n\nThat’s not a technical question.  \nThat’s a responsibility question.\n\nAnd the good news? You can answer it honestly **without being overly optimistic or pessimistic**.\n\n# 1️⃣ First — Separate Hype from Reality\n\nTools like Claude, GPT, Copilot, etc. feel disruptive.  \nBut remember something important:\n\nEvery major automation wave feels like this.\n\n* Spreadsheets were supposed to kill accountants.\n* AutoML was supposed to kill data scientists.\n* Cloud was supposed to kill infra jobs.\n* No-code tools were supposed to kill developers.\n\nInstead:  \nJobs changed. They didn’t vanish.\n\nThe role of a data professional is shifting from:\n\n>\n\nto:\n\n>\n\nThat is much harder to automate.\n\n# 2️⃣ Here’s the Honest Answer You Can Give\n\nIf a student asks: *“Will there still be jobs?”*\n\nYou can say something like:\n\n>\n\nThis is aligned with what you're already doing:\n\n* Data validation (pandera)\n* Feature stores\n* MLOps\n* Monitoring\n* Airflow pipelines\n* Docker\n\nThose are *not* easily automated skills.\n\nAI can help write a function.\n\nIt cannot:\n\n* Diagnose bad data distribution shifts.\n* Design a monitoring strategy.\n* Align models with business risk tolerance.\n* Own a failed deployment in production.\n* Communicate with stakeholders.\n\nThat’s the part that stays human.\n\n# 3️⃣ Are Entry Level Roles Being Affected?\n\nThis is where nuance matters.\n\nSome *traditional* entry-level tasks are shrinking:\n\n* Basic dashboard building\n* Simple SQL extraction\n* Writing boilerplate ML code\n* Minor ETL scripts\n\nYes — AI makes these faster.\n\nBut here's the shift:\n\nEntry-level expectations are rising.\n\nEarlier:\n\n>\n\nNow:\n\n>\n\nThe floor is rising.  \nThe ceiling is rising even faster.\n\nAnd that’s exactly why your lecture topic is powerful.\n\n# 4️⃣ The Frame You Should Use During the Lecture\n\nInstead of defending against AI fear, anchor the conversation like this:\n\n# “AI is automating tasks, not ownership.”\n\nThere’s a big difference between:\n\n* Executing instructions and\n* Owning systems\n\nCompanies don’t hire people to write `fit()`.\n\nThey hire people to:\n\n* Reduce credit risk\n* Improve fraud detection\n* Increase revenue\n* Reduce downtime\n* Manage compliance\n\nAI does not take accountability.\n\nHumans do.\n\nAnd accountability creates jobs.\n\n# 5️⃣ You Can Share Your Own Strategy (Without Fear)\n\nYou don’t need to act invincible.\n\nYou can say:\n\n>\n\nThat makes you relatable, not weak.\n\nStudents trust speakers who admit uncertainty but show strategy.\n\n# 6️⃣ The Most Important Point You Can Tell Them\n\nThe future will reward:\n\n# 1. Systems Thinkers\n\nNot just model builders — pipeline architects.\n\n# 2. Business Translators\n\nPeople who connect ML to ROI and risk.\n\n# 3. Engineers Who Can Ship\n\nProduction > notebooks.\n\n# 4. People Who Use AI as a Multiplier\n\nNot compete against it.\n\n# 7️⃣ A Strong Closing Line You Can Use\n\nIf you want something powerful to end with:\n\n>\n\nOr:\n\n>\n\n# 8️⃣ Reality Check (For You)\n\nYour anxiety is actually a good sign.\n\nIt means:\n\n* You’re thinking long term.\n* You’re not complacent.\n* You’re already upgrading your skillset.\n\nYou moved beyond:  \nSQL + Dashboards  \nto  \nEnd-to-End ML + Deployment + Monitoring.\n\nThat’s not replaceable-level work.\n\nYou’re not trying to survive the AI wave.  \nYou’re learning to surf it.\n\n\n\n  \nFunny enough there is some wisdom in both those responses. My personal view is kinda a hot take but even the best agentic models really aren't that great at writing code.",

Usually the Q&A part will be a lot of questions about the job market.\n\nI'm always honest with them, but I don't want to be all doom and gloom. I let them know that the job market is very competitive, but I pair that with advice - encourage them to spend time networking, to go to local industry events, do something other than go to class (lead a student group, do research with your prof, etc). They love my slide with all of the different job titles and search terms because all they really know is \"data scientist\" or \"data analyst\".\n\nI also stress that this field is always evolving. It's changed in the 10 years since I started working in data, it's changed in the past 3 years since the job market turned around, and it's changed in the past 2 years since AI started booming. And it's going to keep changing in ways that I probably won't expect. New jobs will pop up - in the past few years, we've gotten Analytics Engineer, DevOps, and Data Science is more specialized into inference/experimentation, ML research, ML Eng, ML Ops, etc. Heck Data Science didn't even exist when I started my career 20+ years ago. So who knows what jobs will become available.\n\nSo you have to expect for any career that things are going to change and you'll have to keep adapting. Analytics/DS is my second career, I spent the first 10 years in marketing, and even that went through a lot of changes - the people who were adaptable survived, and the people who wanted to keep \"doing things the way I've always done them\" didn't. This is an important lesson for everyone starting their career, no matter what they are doing.",

          "text": "These are just my opinion, but some of my answers to the questions.\n\n> Will there still be jobs?\n\nYes, because an important part about being a data scientist in the industry is ownership. When you pick up a model, or make a model, you are accountable for it's performance. A manager with no DS experience could ask it basic questions, but they wouldn't understand what to tell the AI to make. Coding by hand will probably happen less and less, but you should be driving your products yourself.\n\n> Will our skills still be valuable?\n\nAbsolutely. You should understand conceptually what each model does for you, is the data good enough, how to explain it, etc.. As they would understand, a neural network is built with all this information inside of it, but it can't pull the right information without being asked the right questions. There's a difference between asking an LLM \"Make me something that predicts house prices\" vs \"Design the base for a linear regression model to predict house prices given their location, num bedrooms, ... and run cross validation to optimize it's hyperparameters.\"\n\n> Is AI removing entry level roles?\n\nThis is probably more true for software engineering than data science. If you are being hired as a data scientist, you are off the bat already expected to know how to build features and make models on your own. You probably wouldn't have a bunch of pre-defined tasks handed to you. Data science jobs are more open ended, so I wouldn't say AI necessarily replaced them. Jobs replaced by AI I think are more grunt-work.",

An (internal) consulting service recently made a POC using LLM and achieved high score on test set. I'm tasked to refine and implement the solution into our current offering.\n\nUpon opening the notebook, I realized this so called LLM solution is actually extreme prompt engineering using chatgpt, with a huge essay containing excruciating details on what to look for and what not to look for.\n\nI was immediately turned off by it. A typical \"interesting\" solution in my mind would be something like looking at demographics, cormobidity conditions, other supporting data (such as lab, prescriptions...et.c). For text cleaning and extracting relevant information, it'd be something like training NER or even tweaking a BERT.\n\nThis consulting solution aimed to achieve the above simply by asking.\n\nWhen asked about the traditional approach, management specifically requires the use of LLM, particular the prompt type, so we can claim using AI in front of even higher up (who are of course not technical).\n\nAt the end of the day, a solution is a solution and I get the need to sell to higher up. However, I found myself extremely unmotivated working on prompt manipulation. Forcing a particular solution is also in direct contradiction to my training (you used to hear a lot about Occam's razor).\n\nIs this now what's required for that biweekly paycheck? That I'm to suppress intellectual curiosity and more rigorous approach to problem solving in favor of calming to be using AI? Is my career in data science finally coming to an end? I'm just having existential crisis here and perhaps in denial of the reality I'm facing.",

Nowadays, it feels like all of my pitches to clients are about answering a request for \"AI\", include a scoping phase where more often than not I try to get them to understand that gen ai isn't the solution (and bring down unrealistic expectations) but ML/stats modelling is better suited for the business case, and then flipping a coin on whether or not they accept while I'm clenching.\n\nThough truth is even on ml projects I've had to do much more software engineering and DevOps for some years now. Clients don't want PoC or pure models anymore, they want a full on prod-ready MVP they can deploy to pilots right from the get go so you can't afford to develop the model and pawn it off to data engineers anymore. My last two ml projects, i spent more time working on how to deploy, SE design patterns, ci/cd, env integration and deployment strategies, value tracking... than actual ml.

There just aren't that many that are anywhere near a decent fit for me. This includes local and remote. \n\nI finished up a job search late last year for senior data scientist position. While the search ended relatively quickly (about 20 applications) I could definitely see a scenario where I can apply to 100 or even 200 positions if I was \"flexible\" with regard to the role matching my skills, but I don't think there's any way I can find 1200 positions unless I was willing to move.\n\nAlso, did you require some kind of sponsorship? The only reason I ask this is because so many of the folks that I see that apply to thousands of jobs if needed sponsorship of some sort.",

I think the main caveat to this assumption are DS roles that require strong domain knowledge to begin with and are more so looking to add data science best practices and problem framing to a team (think fields like finance or life sciences). Honestly it's not hard to see why as someone with strong domain knowledge and basic statistics can now build reasonable predictive models and run an analysis by querying an LLM for the code, check their assumptions with it, run tests and evals, etc. \n\nHaving said that, I'm curious what the subs advice would be for new grads (or early career DS) who graduated around the time of the ChatGPT genesis to maximize their chance of breaking into data? Assume these new grads are bootcamp graduates or did a Bachelors/Masters in a generic data science program (analysis in a notebook, model development, feature engineering, etc) without much prior experience related to statistics or programming. Asking new DS to pivot and target these roles just doesn't seem feasible because a lot of the time the requirements are often a strong software engineering background as a bare minimum.\n\nGiven the field itself is rapidly shifting with the advances in AI we're seeing (increased LLM capabilities, multimodality, agents, etc), what would be your advice for new grads to break into data/AI? Did this cohort of new grads get rug-pulled? Or is there still a play here for them to upskill in other areas like data/analytics engineering to increase their chances of success?",

The writing was on the wall already for data analytics work.\n\nThe advice for new grads is still kind of the same as it was when the labor market got saturated around COVID, show people what you can build. No one cares about Titanic dataset tutorials or a portfolio of Jupyter notebooks with 30 pages of “report”. People want to see a unique insight on novel data, a project that conveys a sense of architecture, or some job experience that goes beyond homework.

To me, the projects that come to mind are jupyter books or data pipelines that feed into a web app but I'm curious if you have other suggestions that are accessible for new grads? \n\nAnd another challenge I think is how to market your work once you have a project going. Of course you can hype up your project on LinkedIn but I think part of the difficulty with this is that hiring managers aren't often looking through your GitHub or portfolio website (happy to be corrected in this as well).",

The goal was to grow customers via core features. On platform reporting was barebones so you needed a dedicated person or teams on the customer’s end to do analytical work and create dashboards.\n\nOnce most of the core features got built the lower priority things on the product roadmap like better dashboards and integrations got worked on. In previous years you’d want a data analyst to do some work on that csv data. That has increasingly been automated at the request of customers which means the need for analysts has shrunk over time. Those titles stayed around, but that was mostly because of responsibility creep. \n\nIt’s kind of similar to when Excel first came around. There just wasn’t the same need to have an entire team of people reconciling ledgers by hand. ",

If you’re seen as someone who can solve a problem with data you’re likely to be asked about math/modeling and other problems later. I work at a major manufacturing company. The grads we hired who dug in and tried to help build solutions with python/r did great, the ones who only wanted to build models struggled.

Pair that with either domain expertise in industries like finance or healthcare or practical LLM application skills such as building RAG systems, designing evaluations, and tracking cost and performance. Use platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, dbt, StrataScratch, and AWS to build data skills, and tools like OpenAI, Hugging Face, LangChain, and Pinecone to experiment with AI applications.

The PM-adjacent path in AI products will need people who are technically literate but also genuinely good with people. That will be a gap down the line. If you enjoy the algorithm development, then lean into AI engineering roles.\n\nThe ceiling in large DS orgs was always real.

For the rest, I created missing indicators to capture any predictive value in the missingness, and left the original missing values since I planned to use XGBoost which can handle them.\n\nI also said that if I used logistic regression, I’d normalize variables between the 1st and 99th percentile to reduce outlier impact and scale them to 0–1 so coefficients are comparable.\n\nI ended up getting rejected, so now I’m wondering if there was something wrong with my approach or if it was likely something else.\n\nEdit: As a measure of variable reduction, I also dropped a bunch of columns that had greater than 95% of same values (constant) stating that they may not have much variance, and if I have more time I’d revisit the 95% threshold and look into the columns that were being dropped.",

          "text": "I don't think you did anything egregious, but here are some thoughts that came to mind:\n\n1. Removing features based on EDA is risky imo. I would rather understand what do the features represent, could they potentially be predictive, etc. Even if a feature is missing in 99% of samples, there could be 1% of samples where it is extremely predictive.\n\n2. I don't understand why you added an indicator for missing values if you are using xgboost models that can natively handle missing values.\n\n3. I don't generally agree with the practice of \"capping outliers\" or filtering outliers, etc. Outliers are not necessarily bad and should not necessarily be treated any differently. The only exceptions in my opinion is if I understand the domain and I know the outliers are caused by a genuine measurement error. \n\n4. Overall, I feel like this type of exercise is fairly useless. It sounds like you went through a very basic generic EDA process, however it doesn't seem to take anything into account regarding the domain/problem/business value, etc.\n\nIf I am asking an interviewee about a problem like this, I am more interested in having them ask questions like:\n\n- What business problem are we solving?\n\n- Are we collecting the data properly for the problem we want to solve?\n\n- What loss functions / evaluation metrics should we use?\n\n- How will the model be used/deployed? Is it properly formulated?\n\n- How should we split the data in train/valid/test?\n\n\nTo me, those are the actual important skills and questions that should be addressed. But walking through some generic EDA process is kind of pointless in my opinion, but I don't really know much about the interview questions and process you went through.",

Extreme values may be rare, but they can reflect the true underlying population rather than errors. In the example you mention, heavy tails are expected. You shouldn't just delete data to make your model \"fit better\".

We bring domain expertise, intuition when you spend all day looking at data and an ability to translate business or product problems into answerable insights via the data to help decision makers.\n\nI also need an explanation why you jumped straight to XGBoost? Simple models often perform just as well. To me we always need a justified reason for jumping to more complicated less interpretable models. This is personally a red flag for me because more complicated does not mean better, and all models have trade offs and people who jump to the most complicated model often have a blind spot for trade offs in our models.\n\nI don’t think you did anything wrong, but you didn’t clear the bar IMO and it seems like they agreed.

      "text": "I’m feeling pretty discouraged about the data science job market in Toronto.\n\nI built a scraper and pulled active roles from SimplyHired + LinkedIn. I was logged into LinkedIn while scraping, so these are not just promoted posts.\n\nMy search keywords were mainly data scientist and data analyst, but a lot of other roles show up under those searches, so that’s why the results include other job families too.\n\nI capped scraping at 18 pages per site (LinkedIn + SimplyHired), because after that the titles get even less relevant.\n\nTotal unique active positions: **617**\n\nBreakdown of main relevant categories:\n\n* Data analyst related: **233**\n* Data scientist related: **124**\n* Machine learning engineer related: **58**\n* Business intelligence specialist: **41**\n* Data engineer: **37**\n* Data science / ML researcher: **33**\n* Analytics engineer: **11**\n* Data associate: **9**\n\nOther titles were hard to categorize: GenAI consultants, biostatistician, stats & analytics software engineer, software engineer (ML), pricing analytics architect, etc.\n\nMy scraper is obviously not perfect. Some roles were likely missed. Some might be on Indeed or Glassdoor and not show up on LinkedIn or SimplyHired, although in my experience most roles get cross-posted. So let's take the 600 and double it. That’s \\~1,200 active DS / ML / DA related roles in the GTA.\n\nShort-term contracts usually don’t get posted like this. Recruiters reach out directly. So let’s add another 500 active short-term contracts floating around. We still end up with less than 2K active positions.\n\nI assume there are thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people right now applying for DS / ML roles here. That ratio alone explains why even getting an interview feels hard.\n\nFor context, companies that had noticeably more active roles in my list included: Allstate, Amazon Development Centre Canada ULC, Atlantis IT Group, Aviva, Canadian Tire Corporation, Capital One, CPP Investments, Deloitte, EvenUp, Keystone Recruitment, Lyft, most banks - TD, RBC, BMO, Scotia, StackAdapt, Rakuten Kobo.\n\nThere are a lot of other companies in my list, but most have only one active DS related position.",

      "text": "Shameless promotion -- I have recently released a book, [Large Language Models for Mortals: A Practical Guide for Analysts](https://crimede-coder.com/blogposts/2026/LLMsForMortals).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7t71ql8ek9jg1.png?width=3980&format=png&auto=webp&s=1870a49ec6030cad49c364062c02cf5da166993f\n\nThe book is focused on using foundation model APIs, with examples from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and AWS in each chapter. The book is compiled via Quarto, so all the code examples are up to date with the latest API changes. The book includes:\n\n* Basics of LLMs (via creating a small predict the next word model), and some examples of calling local LLM models from huggingface (classification, embeddings, NER)\n* An entry chapter on understanding the inputs/outputs of the API. This includes discussing temperature, reasoning/thinking, multi-modal inputs, caching, web search, multi-turn conversations, and estimating costs\n* A chapter on structured outputs. This includes k-shot prompting, parsing JSON vs using pydantic, batch processing examples for all model providers, YAML/XML examples, evaluating accuracy for different prompts/models, and using log-probs to get a probability estimate for a classification\n* A chapter on RAG systems: Discusses semantic search vs keyword via plenty of examples. It also has actual vector database deployment patterns, with examples of in-memory FAISS, on-disk ChromaDB, OpenAI vector store, S3 Vectors, or using DB processing directly with BigQuery. It also has examples of chunking and summarizing PDF documents (OCR, chunking strategies). And discusses precision/recall in measuring a RAG retrieval system.\n* A chapter on tool-calling/MCP/Agents: Uses an example of writing tools to return data from a local database, MCP examples with Claude Desktop, and agent based designs with those tools with OpenAI, Anthropic (showing MCP fixing queries), and Google (showing more complicated directed flows using sequential/parallel agent patterns). This chapter I introduce LLM as a judge to evaluate different models.\n* A chapter with screenshots showing LLM coding tools -- GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Google's Antigravity. Copilot and Claude Code I show examples of adding docstrings and tests for a current repository. And in Claude Code show many of the current features -- MCP, Skills, Commands, Hooks, and how to run in headless mode. Google Antigravity I show building an example Flask app from scratch, and setting up the web-browser interaction and how it can use image models to create test data. I also talk pretty extensively\n* Final chapter is how to keep up in a fast paced changing environment.\n\nTo preview, the first 60+ pages [are available here](https://crimede-coder.com/blogposts/2026/LLMsForMortals). Can purchase worldwide in [paperback](https://crimede-coder.com/cdcstore/product/large-language-models-for-mortals/) or [epub](https://crimede-coder.com/cdcstore/product/large-language-models-for-mortals-a-practical-guide-for-analysts-with-python/). Folks can use the code LLMDEVS for 50% off of the epub price.\n\nI wrote this because the pace of change is so fast, and these are the skills I am looking for in devs to come work for me as AI engineers. It is not rocket science, but hopefully this entry level book is a one stop shop introduction for those looking to learn.",

The math works out about the same. \n\nThe other two tests… I don’t get why you’d do them. Run one test. Never run multiple. You need a bonferroni correction for family-wise error… but if it’s the same response you get no benefit, real or perceived, from testing the same thing multiple times with different tests. Also, they’re non-parametric. If your data are binomially distributed with sufficient N, then you don’t want to run those tests. \n\nInstead of learning how to run tests and saying “roast me,” learn all the theory around statistical testing.

We aren’t just “running a test” there are rules based on the fundamentals of the Z and T distributions.\n\nAnytime you run a test you increase the probability of an error. If you run multiple tests and don’t make a bonferroni correction, then you are making a mistake. The correction is for multiple comparisons. Every time you run a test, it’s an additional comparison. Tests should be pre-determined, otherwise you dive into this world where you’re hunting for an outcome that fits your narrative. There are mathematical proofs behind all of this - it’s not up for debate. \n\nFor you, I would start with the fundamentals of the Z and T tests. The assumptions, when to use one vs the other, and when we can’t use either. Then I’d learn ANOVA. If you can handle multivariate calc, you should understand the derivation of these tests. \n\nAfter that, running the test is really easy.

For a standard A/B test with binary outcomes and a reasonable sample size, a two-proportions z-test and a confidence interval are usually enough to make the decision. A permutation test can be a nice robustness check, but the sign test especially feels unnecessary unless you clearly justify what additional question it’s answering.\n\nYou mention alpha, power, and a 2% practical significance threshold, which is good, but the important part is whether those numbers actually drive your conclusions. Was the sample size calculated based on that 2% lift? Is that lift absolute or relative? And in your write-up, does the business decision hinge on exceeding that threshold, or does it default back to p-values?\n\nThe bigger issue is narrative clarity. If someone has to read through multiple test results to understand whether the treatment should ship, the analysis is doing too much and saying too little. Strong A/B analysis is less about stacking methods and more about clearly linking effect size, uncertainty, and business impact. Right now it doesn't feel like a decision-making framework.",

I am learning all of these methods from scratch so the tendency is to try out as many as possible; I can say it’s for robustness by the underlying reason is definitely more akin to overcompensation.\n\nWith regards to your questions:\n- the sample size was derived from a dummy dataset. I’ve done some practice calculating minimum required sample size, but it wasn’t necessary to include in this analysis.\n- 2% lift is absolute. Relative lift is around ~15%. The executive summary has a somewhat complex but informative gauge chart that shows how the data performed relative to what would be needed to pass the practical significance threshold.\n- from this, I actually have a question: why do we even do statistical tests if practical significance is the threshold for implementation? It seems that setting cohen’s d generally results in more stringent requirements. Why even test for statistical significance at all?\n- for narrative clarity, I would be curious what your thoughts would be after seeing the dashboard! If you haven’t already. I have an executive summary that details all four tests fairly clearly, four pages that go into each in depth, and then one page that delivers the final recommendation.\n\nAgain, thanks for your comment!

I find that interacting with the people I work with helps me work faster (get answers in person, nip bad ideas in the bud, get quick review instead of waiting all day for a Slack), provides me with a lot of 1-off encounters that end up being impactful, and when you literally rarely leave your house it becomes kind of a shitty place to be. My wife also works at home and we both end up being less efficient because it can be difficult not to make small talk in common spaces or shoot the shit since we actually like each other.\n\nAlso, they're paying me far more than I would be making remote. When I was recently interviewing the best remote job I could find paid 30% less before bonus with worse RSUs and a product that frankly was boring as all fucking and I would find it really hard to be interested in working on. Most other opportunities were for large, bloated insurance, healthcare, consulting, or banking companies that paid even worse and were somehow more soul-less.\n\nLastly myself and my friends/colleagues have mostly found that remote individuals rarely, if ever, get promoted and the ceiling is quite high. It's not just about how good you are at the technical parts of the job, but how present you can be elsewhere that make you an asset to an organization. For example, I was in office during a hack week and had a random data automation issue. Someone that sat on the other side of the office heard me talking about the problem and we ended up coming up with a project and re-writing some internal data pipeline automation tools, which actually were later scaled as a replacement for a product that we purchased that cost us a hell of a lot of money. The strong review I provided that individual helped him get promoted and the project allowed me to work directly with our Director, which gave me sway when I requested to join a different team.",

      "text": "See original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r1qo10/comment/o4tynuu/?context=3)\n\nI really appreciate the advice from the original thread. I discovered I was being too kind. The approaches I described were worth trying in good faith but it was enabling the negative behavior I was attempting to combat. I had to accept this was not a coaching problem. Thanks to the folks who responded and called this out.\n\nI scheduled system review meetings with VP/Director-level stakeholders from both the business and technical side. For each system I wrote a document enumerating my concerns alongside a log of  prior conversations I'd had with the team on the subject describing what was raised and what was ignored. Then I asked the team to walk through and defend their design decisions in that room. It was catastrophic. It became clear to others that the services were poorly built and the scientists fundamentally misunderstood the business problems they were trying to solve.  \n  \nThat made the path forward straightforward. The hardest personalities were let go. These were personalities who refused to acknowledge fault and decided to blame their engineering and business partners when the problems were laid bare.   \n  \nAnyone remaining from the previous org has been downleveled and needs to earn the right to lead projects again. The one service with genuine positive ROI survived. In the past, that team transitioned as software engineers under a new manager specifically to create distance from the existing dysfunction. Some of the scientists who left are now asking to return which is positive signal that this was the right move.",
