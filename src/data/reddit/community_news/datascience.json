What seems to matter more is whether DS is tied to a real decision loop or just reporting. Teams where models inform or automate something concrete tend to have better incentives around data quality, infra, and career growth. In contrast, roles that sit downstream of the product with vague impact tend to get squeezed when budgets tighten. For 2026 specifically, I would look less at sector labels and more at signals like ownership of metrics, iteration speed, and whether DS is involved before decisions are made. Those usually tell you more than the brand name.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\n  \nRecently had a common problem, where I had to improve the speed of my code 5x, to get to benchmark performance needed for production level code in my company.\n\nLong story short, OCR model scans a document and the goal is to identify which file from the folder with 100,000 files the scan is referring to.\n\n  \nI used a bag-of-words approach, where 100,000 files were encoded as a sparse matrix using scipy. To prepare the matrix, CountVectorizer from scikit-learn was used, so I ended up with a 100,000 x 60,000 sparse matrix. \n\nTo evaluate the number of shared words between the OCR results, and all files, there is a \"minimum\" method implemented, which performs element-wise minimum operation on matrices of the same shape. To use it, I had to convert the 1-dimensional vector encoding the word count in the new scan, to a huge matrix consisting of the same row 100,000 times.\n\nOne way to do it is to use the \"vstack\" from Scipy, but this turned out to be the bottleneck when I profiled the script. Got the feedback from the main engineer that it has to be below 100ms, and I was stuck at 250ms. \n\nLong story short, there is another way of creating a \"large\" sparse matrix with one row repeated, and that is to use the [kron](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.kron.html#scipy.sparse.kron) method (stands for \"Kronecker product\"). After implementing, inference time got cut to 80ms. \n\n  \nOf course, I left a lot of the details out because it would be too long, but the point is that a somewhat obscure fact from mathematics (I knew about the Kronecker product) got me the biggest performance boost.\n\nA.I. was pretty useful, but on its own wasn't enough to get me down below 100ms, had to do old style programming!!\n\n  \nAnyway, thanks for reading. I posted this because first I wanted to ask for help how to improve performance, but I saw that the rules don't allow for that. So instead, I'm writing about a neat solution that I found. ",

For example, if \"banana\" appears in the OCR 3 times, and in the original document 3 times, I thought the dot product would give 9.\n\nLooking at the documentation for \"CountVectorizer\", this is written for the \"binary\" parameter:  \n  \n\"**binary** bool, default=False\n\nIf True, all non zero counts are set to 1. This is useful for discrete probabilistic models that model binary events rather than integer counts.\"\n\nSo, I'm worried about the #1 case, but I'll explore in more detail",

              "text": "Thank you :)\n\nI use Github Copilot which makes me much faster at writing code. I never accept suggestions with more than 2 lines, because 2 lines is my limit for what I can check quickly for accuracy. Once I developed the initial method, AI helped me get the inference time from 2 seconds to roughly 0.5s, but then it started going into circles, either suggesting things that don't work or stuff that doesn't impact the execution time.\n\n  \nSince I had to get down to 100ms, I decided to drop my initial approach, which was basically a \"for\" loop (comparing the generated text with each record from DB individually), and to try vectorization/matrix operations.\n\n  \nI knew about scikit-learn, so I was reading the documentation until I stumbled upon [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#countvectorizer), which can encode all DB records into a single sparse matrix. Key calculation was finding the number of shared words between the scanned document and each record in the database, which can easily be done with the [minimum](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.16.2/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.minimum.html) function. The only thing missing was how to quickly run this function, because it requires two matrices of the same shape, but the OCR results is only a 1-dimensional sparse matrix. In order to generate a large matrix, AI suggested [vstack](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.vstack.html), which worked and got me down to roughly 250ms, without impacting accuracy. I ran the cProfile profiler on my script, and noticed that the vstack took the most time to execute, so I needed to cut it down. I was thinking about how to construct a large matrix where 1 row is repeated a number of times, reading scipy.sparse docs, looking for another option, and was very happy to see that the Kronecker product was implemented: [LINK](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.16.2/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.kron.html).\n\n  \nOverall, AI was pretty good, and it might have done more with better prompting, but I needed a significant change in approach, and I felt like I was just going in circles with AI, so had to rely on my own neural network",

What will set you apart if you want to be a DS *outside* the normal industries into which microbio PhDs tend to gravitate is your ability to link those skills to the business cases that your target industry cares about.\n\nI would **not care** if you finished some micro-certification on Data Camp or similar.

I've been working specifically as a DS since 2015 but was working as a \"biometrician\" at a boutique environmental stats firm before that.\n\nEverything beyond my MS was in research, field work, and writing technical papers for peer review in fish and wildlife. I was an R expert (and still am, kinda) and although was not \"officially\" a statistician, I had a *very* deep background in mathematical modeling and frequentist stats. When I made the conscious decision to jump to \"industry\" instead of doing environmental work, I had the basics of SQL in my back pocket, thanks to having done a ton of data management at my boutique environmental firm.\n\n**What got me hired first was not the skillz but more how I approached a problem.** Bringing a different skill set to an organization is often times EXACTLY what a hiring manager wants, particularly if they get the signal that you're smart and can learn quickly. This is really all that matters: be smart and learn quickly and be able to show that you are or can do both. \n\nBe able to talk about models you know and how you could apply them. (For example, I applied nesting site fidelity models from sage grouse populations to predicting whether or new patients would return to a specific hospital. Same problem, different data and biz questions.) Be able to talk about how you apply stats. Be able to show how you write functions and think about how a model you've built locally could be handled by DevOps (or yourself) and moved into prod in \\[insert cloud provider of choice\\].\n\nAlthough Python is pretty much the currency of DS these days, there are still some R shops around and there are some good hiring managers left who are toolset agnostic, so long as the work is good and can be productionized. Python is easier to productionize and if you're already an R person, is pretty easy to pick up. Syntax differences can be funky, but aren't insurmountable.\n\nFeel free to reach out via DM with specific questions if you think I can help!",

People like the idea of somebody who can understand the business ie: stakeholders and having the background enables you to do that. With quant skills, you’re already pretty much there but you still probably need a little bit of the “SWE” mindset in creating projects or workflows that are reproducible. Try to have something in your GitHub. It’s a tough job market out there so do keep in mind that if you’re trying to enter, it may take longer. But don’t try to pivot to something totally unrelated like fintech or what have you because with an unrelated degree, it won’t align. Also, it’s worth probably applying to a certain company in a different role and do an internal transfer if a position opens up.",

Full stack in a sense: ideation-to POC -to Production.\n\nMy experience (mid size US company \\~2000 employees) mostly has been talking with the product clients (internal and external), decide on models and approach, training and testing models and putting the tested version python scripts into git, data engineering/production team clones and implements it. \n\nWhat is your story and what do you suggest getting more exposure to the DATA ENG side to become a full stack data scientist?",

Startups can compress these roles, but rigor often gets traded for speed, so you end up learning workarounds more than good systems. the question I always ask is whether the model actually ships and stays alive six months later. If you want more data eng exposure, it usually helps to frame it as reliability and iteration, not career development. That tends to get buy-in faster.",

If you're already solid on DSA and ML system design, spending maybe 20-30% of your remaining prep time on basic OOP principles and common design patterns is reasonable insurance, but don't let it take priority over your core MLE prep.\n\nThe good news is that you don't need to go as deep as a backend engineer would - just understand the fundamentals like SOLID principles, a handful of common patterns (factory, strategy, observer), and how to write clean, maintainable code. Most interviewers care more about seeing that you can structure code reasonably than testing whether you've memorized every design pattern. If you want help figuring out how to answer these kinds of questions when they do come up, I built [interview AI copilot](http://interviews.chat) to handle unexpected interview questions across all topics, including the occasional curveball LLD question in an MLE interview.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,  \nI’m a radar signal processing engineer in automotive and started a small team six months ago. My work so far has been a mix of:  \n  \n1) Radar data analysis for bugs found in customers: performance issues, drop of detections, loss of tracking. I learnt about DSP and radar algorithms.  \n2) C++ coding: small implementations and bug fixes, embedded systems work (inter-core comms, debugging)  \nThe team is growing, so I need to choose one path to focus on. My manager suggested either continuing with:  \n  \n1) Customer support and data analysis, which is very complex and does require a decent understanding of algorithms and math but rarely involves making changes, at best only changing a few parameters. Tough deadlines here.   \nOR  \n2) Moving to C++ customer projects. I will have more scope, ownership and design but ranges from simple integration work to algorithm implementations. So i won't analyse super complex algorithms, and i could potentially work on boring integration topics for 6 months! Its very customer driven. Less deadlines.  \n  \nMy long-term goal is AI, ML, and general algorithm design. I want to build and design algorithms, not just tune parameters or implement specs.\n\n  \nWhich path would you choose to maximize growth toward AI and algorithm work, and how would you make it as useful as possible?  \nWhat kind of questions i could ask my manager?  \n  \nThank you.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m currently working on a project using utility asset data (GIS / SAP / AMI) and I’m exploring whether this is a solid use case for introducing ML into a **customer-to-transformer matching audit** problem. The goal is to ensure that meters (each associated with a customer) are connected to the correct transformer.\n\n# Important context\n\n* Current customer → transformer associations are driven by a **location ID** containing circuit, address/road, and company (opco).\n* After an initial analysis, some associations appear wrong, but **ground truth is partial** and validation is expensive (field work).\n* The goal is **NOT** to auto-assign transformers.\n* The goal is to **prioritize which existing matches are most likely wrong**.\n\nI’m leaning toward framing this as a **probabilistic risk scoring** problem rather than a hard classification task, with something like **logistic regression** as a first model due to interpretability and governance needs.\n\n# Initial checks / predictors under consideration\n\n**1) Distance**\n\n* Binary distance thresholds (e.g., >550 ft)\n* Whether the assigned transformer is the **nearest** transformer\n* Distance ratio: distance to assigned vs. nearest transformer (e.g., nearest is 10 ft away but assigned is 500 ft away)\n\n**2) Voltage consistency**\n\n* Identifying customers with similar service voltage\n* Using voltage consistency as a signal to flag unlikely associations (challenging due to very high customer volume)\n\nModel output to be: \n\nP(current customer → transformer match is wrong)\n\n\n\nThis probability would be used to define operational tiers (auto-safe, monitor, desktop review, field validation).\n\n# Questions\n\n1. Does **logistic regression** make sense as a first model for this type of probabilistic audit problem?\n2. Any pitfalls when relying heavily on **distance + voltage** as primary predictors?\n3. When people move beyond logistic regression here, is it usually **tree-based models + calibration**?\n4. Any advice on **threshold / tier design** when labels are noisy and incomplete?",

          "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m at a career crossroads and would appreciate some grounded advice. I have 5 years of experience in the insurance/reinsurance domain, working in catastrophe modeling, risk analytics, data cleaning, and geocoding using in house tools. My work has involved heavy data analysis, stakeholder interaction, and translating model outputs into business insights.\n\nI want to change domains and am evaluating two paths:\n\n1. MS abroad 2026 (Data Science / Analytics / related tech programs)\n2. MBA in India (to pivot into consulting / strategy / management roles)\n\nMy key questions: For someone at 5 years experience, which path offers a more realistic and sustainable domain switch? How do recruiters view prior domain experience in each case? Any regrets from people who chose MS vs MBA (or vice versa)? Are there risks of being “overqualified but underexperienced” in either path? My priority is long-term career satisfaction and growth, not just immediate compensation.\n\nThanks in advance...would really value insights from people who’ve faced a similar situation.",

Early on, it helps to focus on core stats, data wrangling, and being able to explain why a model should exist at all. Small end to end projects where you define the question, deal with messy data, and communicate trade-offs tend to be more valuable than stacking certificates. the transition is usually less about learning one more library and more about demonstrating how you think about data in context.",

So you are probably right that descriptively lots of data analysts don't do any causal inference at all, but I'd maintain that if a data analyst wants to improve their impact at their organization, taking a more complete approach to thinking about causal inference (what are the mechanisms driving the relationships they see) is the best way for them to increase their impact and unlock more career opportunities.\n\nIt doesn't need to even be super rigorous applications, but understanding why a diff-in-diff works the way it does is super helpful for unlocking bigger impacts as a data analyst.",
