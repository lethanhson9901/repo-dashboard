Then you have the option to do multiple rounds of coarse-to-fine random search from there.\n\nIf you're training larger or more expensive models, this may be where you stop due to budget or time constraints. I would say this is a concern if you're using more heavy duty neural nets for nlp, vision etc. but not typically for xgboost. More searching [gives better expected results](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03004) if you can fit it in your budget.\n\nThen once you have confidence you've narrowed down the neighborhood you're looking in, you can try Bayesian optimization using the validation metrics collected so far as a starting point. This part is just squeezing out the last little bits of performance.\n\nHyper parameter tuning with different frameworks usually let you pick the number of runs per round and the first round will usually do a random search for you before moving to Bayesian optimization. Just make sure the number of models in the initial round is not too small.\n\nEdit: hyperlinks properly working",

The harder part is deciding *what* to be right about, and *where* to apply effort.\n\nFor those of you who’ve made a similar transition:\n\n* How did you train your sense of value judgment?\n* How do you decide what *not* to work on?\n* What helped you move from “doing good work yourself” to “creating leverage through others”?\n* Any mental models, habits, or mistakes-you-learned-from that were particularly helpful?\n\nWould love to hear how people here think about this shift.

You start noticing which projects quietly create leverage and which ones just generate slides. Saying no became easier once I saw how much opportunity cost there really is. the hardest habit to break was jumping into do the work because I could do it faster.

          "text": "Lots of good wisdom in already in this thread but I'll add my two cents on how to get work done through other people rather than doing in yourself. I read once in a management book (I think it was \"the making of a manager\") that your job as a team lead is to 1) define a goal, 2) help your team understand if they are moving towards that goal, and 3) inspire them to care about that goal. In my experience, that second role - helping people understand if they're moving towards a goal - is the most important part but it's also easiest to overlook. It can be tough in data work to understand if you're making progress or if you're getting stuck in a rabbit hole. Your instincts on how to zig and zag through various small decisions are likely great, which is why you got promoted, and now your job is to imprint upon your intuitions and tastes on your team so that they can start to make those same micro-decisions. So its important to both checkin frequently to help make those decisions, as well as explain your reasoning (e.g. \"we want to display the data in this way because our stakeholders are particularly interested in understanding this dimension of the data\" versus \"use a bar chart because its cleaner\"). \n\n  \nRelatedly, the best tactical management advice I ever got was \"don't only taste the soup when it's done.\" The worst thing you can do as a team lead is assign a task that takes weeks and only review it when it's done. By contrast, great head chefs will check in along the way to see how their chefs are prepping the ingredients, they will take an early taste of the stock, give adjustments, etc. That can sometimes be hard for younger ICs since they might believe that they should only show you finished products or only checkin when they've made great progress. So you'll need to encourage checkins when they're stuck and help them feel comfortable being vulnerable when something is not going well.",

          "text": "No questions myself but wanted to open myself to questions for folks who are looking to transition into the field or grow their DS career. I’m a staff-level data scientist at a hyperscaler in SF that you have heard of. I’ve been in the field for 6 years now. I come from a non-conventional background (before DS I worked in various roles across warehouse ops for an ecommerce startup, management consulting, and finance). \n\n[please don’t message me for a referral - I typically only refer folks I can vouch for personally 🙏]\n\n\n- EQ > IQ. DS is a field that attracts a lot of smart, quiet introverts. Working on sociability, networking, and “putting yourself out there” returns far higher dividends than polishing your resume or gaining more and more tech skills. It may surprise you but speaking to folks at conferences, parties, or worst case LinkedIn messaging your school alumni can open lots of unexpected doors. \n- The same is true on the job. Surprise: people like working with those they like to be around. Landing impact and doing well in your data science role is 75% stakeholder management and 25% actually coding. The most successful DSes aren’t those with the best code, they’re those who can run the business. \n- Data science isn’t an entry level job. An entry level data scientist typically has at least a few years work experience in an adjacent role. I see a lot of folks coming from economic consulting, analytics, product management, and academia. The reason for this is that domain knowledge and business acumen are necessary to translate your technical work into a business result.\n- Breaking into data science can be somewhat random. My best advice for those not in the industry is to look for opportunities to use data science methods to improve processes or change the business wherever you currently work. I landed my first data science role because I started applying data science methods to inventory management, then moved on to support our ads team, and eventually got a new “analytics” job title. That cracked the door open for me to enter data science.",

I have a few questions since I will finalize my higher education soon and I figured that this would be the best place to get good contructive opinions and advice. \n\nI am currently a student in migration studies (BA and currently writing the thesis for the MA). Throughout these studies I have been able to discover different statistical methods of analysis and I have tried to focused on that whenever I had the opportunity. Turns out I really like working with stats and big datasets from formulating a research question to providing clear and comprehensible results with good visualizations. During this MA I have also done an internship at the department of the university where I basically was the 'stats guy' and did a bunch of stuff with a fresh new database and helped every researchers who were working with it. I will also use stats for my thesis. I will do a second MA next year (if I get admitted 🤞) that is much more focused on economy and includes more stats focused courses, nottably econometrics.\n\nWith all of this background I would really like to find a job as a data analyst or anything related to data gathering/vizualization/ risk analysis, etc.. I was wondering if you think that my profile is something common in this job market? From what I have seen online and what information I got from my network, data analysts are needed but many job posts seem to search for profiles in computer science which is not really where I come from. (Btw I live in Scandinavia and can speak French, english and hopefully a nordic language soon)\n\nAnyway, thank you in advance for reading all of this! If you think you have anything interesting to say about this please do😁",

          "text": "From what I have seen, the strategy matters less than being honest about what problem you are actually trying to offload. A lot of teams jump straight to “generate code” and hit the validation wall you describe, because the review cost is real. The places where it seems to work better are narrow, well scoped tasks where correctness is easy to check, like draft documentation, test cases, or refactoring suggestions rather than greenfield logic. On the tooling side, flexibility usually comes from constraining the interface rather than the model. If the inputs and outputs are boring and well defined, the LLM can be sloppy internally without breaking anything. The harder question is whether the team is willing to invest in those interfaces, because that work often looks like overhead rather than leverage at first.",
