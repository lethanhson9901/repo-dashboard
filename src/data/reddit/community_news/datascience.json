I was working with an HR rep, who didn't show up for our negotiation call and then I got an email saying my application had been withdrawn. The Hiring Manager had no idea.\n* AirBnB ghosted me twice for 2 different positions with 2 different teams. I had been told that I had passed the round and then the recruiter stopped replying.\n* I was ghosted by Pinterest in September. Same thing: passed the technical screen, never heard back. Recruiter reached back out Monday of this week to schedule the next round.\n* Completed the entire process with Block. Recruiter was supposed to schedule a call with me and the Hiring Manager to discuss offer terms. Never got a call, never got an email response.\n\nIt's hard to not blame myself in some of these cases, like the insurance example since I did counter-offer them, but ghosting is a shitty practice and becoming all too common. I highly doubt any company is using code from a case study for themselves if they actually have existing Data Scientists. What's really happening is that the market is flooded with good candidates and they don't give a fuck about burning a bridge with you because someone just as good or possibly better will come along.",

I have known a few former employees that all left due to rampant toxicity and poor WLB. I interviewed with them because my MO is to never turn anything down until the very end and see for myself. I had pretty bad vibes from the HM and a few others I interviewed with. I think my stats were:\n\n* 5 months total searching\n* 52 companies\n* 100% pass rate on technical screens\n* 100% pass rate on technical take home exams\n* I \"failed\" 5 HM screens, but quite frankly it would have never worked due to personality differences so that's fine.\n* A few ghostings randomly in the middle of rounds, so I will never know\n* 85% pass rate on presentations. I think the failures were my fault: I was either too verbose or too succinct for the given audience.\n* 14 offer rounds. 9 of those were \"we promoted someone from the inside\" or \"we had another candidate\". It was really upsetting to hear when it was due to another candidate and I have looked several of the companies up to see who they hired. In retrospect I am glad it didn't work out as they hired people who were more junior in experience, but prolific on spam posting on Medium and LinkedIn about their knowledge despite never having been in an actual role for longer than 2 years and never in a Senior or Staff role for more than 1.5. Their loss, not mine.\n* 5 quality offers. I passed on one due to insanely short relocation turnaround, another was too junior of a role and it did not align, and the other pass just a role that I honestly don't think I would have been happy in. The remaining 2 are the one I accepted and the one I mentioned above when I was ghosted.",

I am more comfortable when the scope is clearly time-boxed, discussed live, and obviously synthetic. If it looks like unpaid consulting or has unclear evaluation criteria, that is usually a signal about how the team treats candidates and, often, employees.\n\nThe market does amplify this behavior, but it is also a reflection of weak hiring discipline.

In contrast, roles that sit downstream of the product with vague impact tend to get squeezed when budgets tighten.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\n  \nRecently had a common problem, where I had to improve the speed of my code 5x, to get to benchmark performance needed for production level code in my company.\n\nLong story short, OCR model scans a document and the goal is to identify which file from the folder with 100,000 files the scan is referring to.\n\n  \nI used a bag-of-words approach, where 100,000 files were encoded as a sparse matrix using scipy. To prepare the matrix, CountVectorizer from scikit-learn was used, so I ended up with a 100,000 x 60,000 sparse matrix. \n\nTo evaluate the number of shared words between the OCR results, and all files, there is a \"minimum\" method implemented, which performs element-wise minimum operation on matrices of the same shape. To use it, I had to convert the 1-dimensional vector encoding the word count in the new scan, to a huge matrix consisting of the same row 100,000 times.\n\nOne way to do it is to use the \"vstack\" from Scipy, but this turned out to be the bottleneck when I profiled the script. Got the feedback from the main engineer that it has to be below 100ms, and I was stuck at 250ms. \n\nLong story short, there is another way of creating a \"large\" sparse matrix with one row repeated, and that is to use the [kron](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.kron.html#scipy.sparse.kron) method (stands for \"Kronecker product\"). After implementing, inference time got cut to 80ms. \n\n  \nOf course, I left a lot of the details out because it would be too long, but the point is that a somewhat obscure fact from mathematics (I knew about the Kronecker product) got me the biggest performance boost.\n\nA.I. was pretty useful, but on its own wasn't enough to get me down below 100ms, had to do old style programming!!\n\n  \nAnyway, thanks for reading. I posted this because first I wanted to ask for help how to improve performance, but I saw that the rules don't allow for that. So instead, I'm writing about a neat solution that I found. ",

I also like that this came out of profiling rather than guessing. In production settings, that mindset often matters more than any single trick.",

I have seen similar wins from avoiding explicit expansion and letting linear algebra do the work implicitly. It also highlights why profiling matters more than clever modeling once you are in production. Out of curiosity, did you consider alternatives like inverted indices or pruning before the comparison, or was the latency budget tight enough that you needed to stay fully vectorized?",

For example, if \"banana\" appears in the OCR 3 times, and in the original document 3 times, I thought the dot product would give 9.\n\nLooking at the documentation for \"CountVectorizer\", this is written for the \"binary\" parameter:  \n  \n\"**binary** bool, default=False\n\nIf True, all non zero counts are set to 1.

I never accept suggestions with more than 2 lines, because 2 lines is my limit for what I can check quickly for accuracy. Once I developed the initial method, AI helped me get the inference time from 2 seconds to roughly 0.5s, but then it started going into circles, either suggesting things that don't work or stuff that doesn't impact the execution time.\n\n  \nSince I had to get down to 100ms, I decided to drop my initial approach, which was basically a \"for\" loop (comparing the generated text with each record from DB individually), and to try vectorization/matrix operations.\n\n  \nI knew about scikit-learn, so I was reading the documentation until I stumbled upon [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#countvectorizer), which can encode all DB records into a single sparse matrix. Key calculation was finding the number of shared words between the scanned document and each record in the database, which can easily be done with the [minimum](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.16.2/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.minimum.html) function. The only thing missing was how to quickly run this function, because it requires two matrices of the same shape, but the OCR results is only a 1-dimensional sparse matrix. In order to generate a large matrix, AI suggested [vstack](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.vstack.html), which worked and got me down to roughly 250ms, without impacting accuracy. I ran the cProfile profiler on my script, and noticed that the vstack took the most time to execute, so I needed to cut it down. I was thinking about how to construct a large matrix where 1 row is repeated a number of times, reading scipy.sparse docs, looking for another option, and was very happy to see that the Kronecker product was implemented: [LINK](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.16.2/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.kron.html).\n\n  \nOverall, AI was pretty good, and it might have done more with better prompting, but I needed a significant change in approach, and I felt like I was just going in circles with AI, so had to rely on my own neural network",

This is really all that matters: be smart and learn quickly and be able to show that you are or can do both. \n\nBe able to talk about models you know and how you could apply them. (For example, I applied nesting site fidelity models from sage grouse populations to predicting whether or new patients would return to a specific hospital. Same problem, different data and biz questions.) Be able to talk about how you apply stats. Be able to show how you write functions and think about how a model you've built locally could be handled by DevOps (or yourself) and moved into prod in \\[insert cloud provider of choice\\].\n\nAlthough Python is pretty much the currency of DS these days, there are still some R shops around and there are some good hiring managers left who are toolset agnostic, so long as the work is good and can be productionized. Python is easier to productionize and if you're already an R person, is pretty easy to pick up.

A PhD already helps a lot there, especially if you can frame your research work in terms of data cleaning, assumptions, tradeoffs, and decision making. Structured tracks are fine to fill gaps, but nobody I know checks whether someone completed an entire ladder. One or two solid projects where you show end to end thinking, SQL pulls, Python analysis, and a clear takeaway matter way more. If you can talk through why you chose certain methods and what you would do differently with more time or data, that usually moves you from interesting to hireable.",

Integration work at least keeps you writing code and understanding system boundaries, which is easier to evolve into ownership of algorithms later.\n\nThat said, the ideal move is usually not choosing one extreme. I would push your manager for explicit time or scope around algorithm ownership, even small pieces, validation logic, prototypes, or improvements rather than just glue work.

Big tech companies might throw in some OOP and design patterns questions to assess your software engineering fundamentals, but they're usually not the main focus. Smaller companies or places where the MLE role is closer to a traditional SWE role might dig deeper into LLD. If you're already solid on DSA and ML system design, spending maybe 20-30% of your remaining prep time on basic OOP principles and common design patterns is reasonable insurance, but don't let it take priority over your core MLE prep.\n\nThe good news is that you don't need to go as deep as a backend engineer would - just understand the fundamentals like SOLID principles, a handful of common patterns (factory, strategy, observer), and how to write clean, maintainable code. Most interviewers care more about seeing that you can structure code reasonably than testing whether you've memorized every design pattern.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m currently working on a project using utility asset data (GIS / SAP / AMI) and I’m exploring whether this is a solid use case for introducing ML into a **customer-to-transformer matching audit** problem. The goal is to ensure that meters (each associated with a customer) are connected to the correct transformer.\n\n# Important context\n\n* Current customer → transformer associations are driven by a **location ID** containing circuit, address/road, and company (opco).\n* After an initial analysis, some associations appear wrong, but **ground truth is partial** and validation is expensive (field work).\n* The goal is **NOT** to auto-assign transformers.\n* The goal is to **prioritize which existing matches are most likely wrong**.\n\nI’m leaning toward framing this as a **probabilistic risk scoring** problem rather than a hard classification task, with something like **logistic regression** as a first model due to interpretability and governance needs.\n\n# Initial checks / predictors under consideration\n\n**1) Distance**\n\n* Binary distance thresholds (e.g., >550 ft)\n* Whether the assigned transformer is the **nearest** transformer\n* Distance ratio: distance to assigned vs. nearest transformer (e.g., nearest is 10 ft away but assigned is 500 ft away)\n\n**2) Voltage consistency**\n\n* Identifying customers with similar service voltage\n* Using voltage consistency as a signal to flag unlikely associations (challenging due to very high customer volume)\n\nModel output to be: \n\nP(current customer → transformer match is wrong)\n\n\n\nThis probability would be used to define operational tiers (auto-safe, monitor, desktop review, field validation).\n\n# Questions\n\n1. Does **logistic regression** make sense as a first model for this type of probabilistic audit problem?\n2. Any pitfalls when relying heavily on **distance + voltage** as primary predictors?\n3. When people move beyond logistic regression here, is it usually **tree-based models + calibration**?\n4. Any advice on **threshold / tier design** when labels are noisy and incomplete?",

Just watch out for geographic clustering effects messing with your distance assumptions (like rural vs urban transformer density)\n\n  \nFor thresholds with noisy labels, start conservative and let the field validation feedback tune your cutoffs over time rather than trying to optimize on incomplete ground truth upfront",

For most associations, correctness is  uncertain unless there’s been field validation (which is very costly). The way I’m thinking about it is to only train on a subset of high-confidence labels: confirmed field corrections where available, plus some very strong inferred cases (like extreme distance ratios with a clearly closer viable transformer). Everything in the gray area would stay unlabeled and only be scored. The intent is to rank/prioritize review, not to auto-correct matches. The new field validation would feed back as additional high-confidence labels, so the model and thresholds can be tuned iteratively",

Startups can compress these roles, but rigor often gets traded for speed, so you end up learning workarounds more than good systems. the question I always ask is whether the model actually ships and stays alive six months later.

If the goal is document identification rather than synthesis, you want something that does embeddings well, is stable, and can be deployed on prem without surprises. The LLM then mostly acts as a query interpreter on top of search.\n\nI would evaluate options based on how transparent the retrieval is, how much control you have over chunking and metadata filters, and how predictable the outputs are under edge cases. In practice, simpler models paired with a solid vector store and strict prompting often outperform larger models for legal or compliance constrained setups. The risk is less hallucination and more overconfidence, so strong guardrails and evaluation matter more than raw model capability.",
