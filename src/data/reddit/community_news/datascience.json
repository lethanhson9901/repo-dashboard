More than one of the models my team and I have built at Amazon have $100s of millions in annual impact, either via top line revenue, company spend, or loss avoidance. Not all of them are incredibly complex (quite often the opposite as they emphasize explainability), but the scientists who do well here are able to understand high value/complex business problems and apply the right solution. I like to think of it like the ship repair problem.\n\nA ship's engine failed, halting production, and no mechanic could fix it. An expert tapped a specific spot with a hammer, instantly repairing it. The $10,000 bill was questioned, prompting the expert to itemize: $1 for tapping, $9,999 for knowing where to tap, highlighting that expertise, not just education and effort, holds immense value.",

The reason is mainly that DS here are working on more valuable products and supporting teams of better paid engineers. I'm touching things that involve 10-50x more revenue than what I did at a F500 and I get paid 2.5x more because of it. I'm certainly not 2.5x smarter or harder working than I was back then.",

Working on projects that get CEO level visibility on both. When I interview, I have a practice of not looking at the resume to avoid biasing against candidates (I’m interviewing for staff+). The candidates that deeply impress me are far more likely to have FAANG or FAANG-adjacent experience.\n\nThere’s a depth and complete comfort with statistical theory, ability to tackle a new technical problem on the spot, analytical creativity, and product intuition that I’ve only observed in candidates from top tech companies. That’s not to say that I don’t get a lot of FAANG candidates that are terrible. Just last 1-2 weeks I interviewed a former Meta and Amazon DS that could barely pass a simple algorithms interview. But the only candidates that ever completely crush my theoretical stats or optimization interviews are FAANG or FAANG adjacent (AirBnB, Uber, Stitch Fix from 5 years ago, etc), particularly Netflix and Google.\n\nI don’t know what type of DS roles you had in mind, the picture could be different from more product analytics roles. But for roles with a high technical bar, that’s not my experience.\n\nAlso, I would say companies are like schools, the biggest difference isn’t at the average but the p80 or p90.",

Most people simply do not have the mental stamina or curiosity.\n\nAnother stark contrast is the ability to see what is important vs. what is not.

Like in my F10 role we’d take our time and have pretty specific scope and just keep on chugging and passing week by week while giving little updates. At FAANG, the question/idea comes up Monday, there’s a team spun up Tuesday with 3 docs for alignment, then 1-2 people powering through deeper analyses than I saw elsewhere Wednesday, a pre-meeting with leads and a few $1B+ scoped org leaders Thursday (who’ve already asked twice that week when you’d be done), then VPs shift teams to focus the laser on your DS recs after an audience Friday, probably netting 5x the yearly salary for the group in the next quarter of execution, while the same cycle starts the next week. All while 2-5 mega projects are ongoing, and metrics reports and ad hoc analyses are being written at all times. TBH, the roles are vastly underpaid at $500k for the value they truly create by aiming the $10M/yr engineering team that drives 6-9x ROI year after year (literally, I calculated this as part of planning: 6x ROI on headcount was the bottom cutoff for “right sizing” the org last year, with mean Eng cost of $950k as the input).\n\nThat’s the lowest level DS. The rest crush more. No joke. It’s just not the same scale, and every DS is extraordinarily capable or we just get other ones.\n\nThere’s a lot of talk about hiring fresh PhDs by other companies in the comments here and tbh, the hard part is never technical (that’s the minimum cost of entry), it’s doing a job and making the company value and prioritizing work—that’s why companies pay big bucks.",

I disagree with other commenters, the role only consumes your life if the tasks take you more time. That’s why often the most successful scientists are ones that work well and quickly. There’s a bell curve in any profession. These companies pay big bucks and they expect big productivity. Successful scientists often write production code, and working quickly with good instincts also sets you up to support during SEVs and on-call which makes you more valuable to a company. Experimentation can also be a big part of it: good instincts and mastery of broad tools, using them to form compelling arguments and inform high-impact decisions. Comfort effectively communicating with (often non-technical) leadership. It goes way beyond gradient descent, self-attention, and defining statistical power.\n\nE: overall, I think you can’t be truly successful in that context without good instincts. Root causes/phenomena need to occur to you, you can’t miss them. And where others might pontificate for hours before they make realizations, they should ideally be relatively obvious to you (or take minimal steps to formulate). As someone who has worked at both regular companies and big tech, the individual artifacts aren’t necessarily always that different, but the volume of artifacts is totally different.",

Then you have the option to do multiple rounds of coarse-to-fine random search from there.\n\nIf you're training larger or more expensive models, this may be where you stop due to budget or time constraints. I would say this is a concern if you're using more heavy duty neural nets for nlp, vision etc. but not typically for xgboost. More searching [gives better expected results](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03004) if you can fit it in your budget.\n\nThen once you have confidence you've narrowed down the neighborhood you're looking in, you can try Bayesian optimization using the validation metrics collected so far as a starting point. This part is just squeezing out the last little bits of performance.\n\nHyper parameter tuning with different frameworks usually let you pick the number of runs per round and the first round will usually do a random search for you before moving to Bayesian optimization. Just make sure the number of models in the initial round is not too small.\n\nEdit: hyperlinks properly working",

If you're doing an exhaustive grid search, I would recommend using the different optimizer/search methods.  \nIt will likely take a fraction of the time with other methods, and even if you don't get the best of the best hyper parameters it'll likely only differ from the absolute best by an insignificant amount in terms of the metric you're using.\n\nFor relatively simple and small models, I find [Halving Grid Search ](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV) is a fast and simple way that gets decent enough results.

It’s much more about judgment than execution:\n\n* Is this problem even worth solving?\n* Does it matter for the business or the system as a whole?\n* Is it worth spending our limited time and people on it instead of something else?\n* How do I get results *through* other people and through the organization, rather than by doing everything myself?\n\nI find that being “technically right” is often not the hard part anymore. The harder part is deciding *what* to be right about, and *where* to apply effort.\n\nFor those of you who’ve made a similar transition:\n\n* How did you train your sense of value judgment?\n* How do you decide what *not* to work on?\n* What helped you move from “doing good work yourself” to “creating leverage through others”?\n* Any mental models, habits, or mistakes-you-learned-from that were particularly helpful?\n\nWould love to hear how people here think about this shift.

That means the same as it does in any sales role, listen to your customers and deliver what makes them happy.  \n\nOh, another thing is that consistency of tools, techniques and approach across your team will make it easier for you to rearrange resources.",

A good week was not shipping something myself, but unblocking someone else, killing a low value project early, or reframing a vague request into something the team could actually execute. That felt uncomfortable at first because it is less visible and less concrete.\n\nMy sense of judgment got better by sitting closer to stakeholders and paying attention to second order effects. You start noticing which projects quietly create leverage and which ones just generate slides. Saying no became easier once I saw how much opportunity cost there really is. the hardest habit to break was jumping into do the work because I could do it faster. Letting others struggle a bit, while still supporting them, ended up creating way more value long term. It sounds like you are already asking the right questions, which is honestly most of the transition.",

And this position should come with more responsibility around what to do and why you do it. \n\nAlso, I would expect this position to have more cross-company visibility and influence.

          "text": "Lots of good wisdom in already in this thread but I'll add my two cents on how to get work done through other people rather than doing in yourself. I read once in a management book (I think it was \"the making of a manager\") that your job as a team lead is to 1) define a goal, 2) help your team understand if they are moving towards that goal, and 3) inspire them to care about that goal. In my experience, that second role - helping people understand if they're moving towards a goal - is the most important part but it's also easiest to overlook. It can be tough in data work to understand if you're making progress or if you're getting stuck in a rabbit hole. Your instincts on how to zig and zag through various small decisions are likely great, which is why you got promoted, and now your job is to imprint upon your intuitions and tastes on your team so that they can start to make those same micro-decisions. So its important to both checkin frequently to help make those decisions, as well as explain your reasoning (e.g. \"we want to display the data in this way because our stakeholders are particularly interested in understanding this dimension of the data\" versus \"use a bar chart because its cleaner\"). \n\n  \nRelatedly, the best tactical management advice I ever got was \"don't only taste the soup when it's done.\" The worst thing you can do as a team lead is assign a task that takes weeks and only review it when it's done. By contrast, great head chefs will check in along the way to see how their chefs are prepping the ingredients, they will take an early taste of the stock, give adjustments, etc. That can sometimes be hard for younger ICs since they might believe that they should only show you finished products or only checkin when they've made great progress. So you'll need to encourage checkins when they're stuck and help them feel comfortable being vulnerable when something is not going well.",

          "text": "No questions myself but wanted to open myself to questions for folks who are looking to transition into the field or grow their DS career. I’m a staff-level data scientist at a hyperscaler in SF that you have heard of. I’ve been in the field for 6 years now. I come from a non-conventional background (before DS I worked in various roles across warehouse ops for an ecommerce startup, management consulting, and finance). \n\n[please don’t message me for a referral - I typically only refer folks I can vouch for personally 🙏]\n\n\n- EQ > IQ. DS is a field that attracts a lot of smart, quiet introverts. Working on sociability, networking, and “putting yourself out there” returns far higher dividends than polishing your resume or gaining more and more tech skills. It may surprise you but speaking to folks at conferences, parties, or worst case LinkedIn messaging your school alumni can open lots of unexpected doors. \n- The same is true on the job. Surprise: people like working with those they like to be around. Landing impact and doing well in your data science role is 75% stakeholder management and 25% actually coding. The most successful DSes aren’t those with the best code, they’re those who can run the business. \n- Data science isn’t an entry level job. An entry level data scientist typically has at least a few years work experience in an adjacent role. I see a lot of folks coming from economic consulting, analytics, product management, and academia. The reason for this is that domain knowledge and business acumen are necessary to translate your technical work into a business result.\n- Breaking into data science can be somewhat random. My best advice for those not in the industry is to look for opportunities to use data science methods to improve processes or change the business wherever you currently work. I landed my first data science role because I started applying data science methods to inventory management, then moved on to support our ads team, and eventually got a new “analytics” job title. That cracked the door open for me to enter data science.",

I have a few questions since I will finalize my higher education soon and I figured that this would be the best place to get good contructive opinions and advice. \n\nI am currently a student in migration studies (BA and currently writing the thesis for the MA). Throughout these studies I have been able to discover different statistical methods of analysis and I have tried to focused on that whenever I had the opportunity. Turns out I really like working with stats and big datasets from formulating a research question to providing clear and comprehensible results with good visualizations. During this MA I have also done an internship at the department of the university where I basically was the 'stats guy' and did a bunch of stuff with a fresh new database and helped every researchers who were working with it. I will also use stats for my thesis. I will do a second MA next year (if I get admitted 🤞) that is much more focused on economy and includes more stats focused courses, nottably econometrics.\n\nWith all of this background I would really like to find a job as a data analyst or anything related to data gathering/vizualization/ risk analysis, etc.. I was wondering if you think that my profile is something common in this job market? From what I have seen online and what information I got from my network, data analysts are needed but many job posts seem to search for profiles in computer science which is not really where I come from. (Btw I live in Scandinavia and can speak French, english and hopefully a nordic language soon)\n\nAnyway, thank you in advance for reading all of this! If you think you have anything interesting to say about this please do😁",

          "text": "From what I have seen, the strategy matters less than being honest about what problem you are actually trying to offload. A lot of teams jump straight to “generate code” and hit the validation wall you describe, because the review cost is real. The places where it seems to work better are narrow, well scoped tasks where correctness is easy to check, like draft documentation, test cases, or refactoring suggestions rather than greenfield logic. On the tooling side, flexibility usually comes from constraining the interface rather than the model. If the inputs and outputs are boring and well defined, the LLM can be sloppy internally without breaking anything. The harder question is whether the team is willing to invest in those interfaces, because that work often looks like overhead rather than leverage at first.",

Ask for one function or one idea, not a full script. Short answers are easier to read and trust. A quick explanation with the code helps catch mistakes fast. As another redditor pointed out, decide on a particular template format you want the LLM input and output to be based upon and it will help you to streamline the use case workflows much better..Lastly, LLM’s efficiency is entirely depended on the context, the inputs you are provided, the sources you are asking it to refer to before it spurts out the responses, hence having a proper data source, data cleaning, document chunking, embeddings , RAG models, evaluation metrics..pondering over all of these goes a long way in unleashing these machine bots in an effective manner",

Make sure you set guardrails and adhere to strict TDD methods.\n\nIt's great at documentation but ironically generates too much of it to be useful for the team. It's useful for other agents I guess.\n\nBut wow, it's terrible at modeling exercises. Does not understand experiment design, data leakage, or business logic despite extensive prompting. Makes schoolboy DS errors.",
