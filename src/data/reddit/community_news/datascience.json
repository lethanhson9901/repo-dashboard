The Hiring Manager had no idea.\n* AirBnB ghosted me twice for 2 different positions with 2 different teams.

I have known a few former employees that all left due to rampant toxicity and poor WLB. I interviewed with them because my MO is to never turn anything down until the very end and see for myself. I had pretty bad vibes from the HM and a few others I interviewed with. I think my stats were:\n\n* 5 months total searching\n* 52 companies\n* 100% pass rate on technical screens\n* 100% pass rate on technical take home exams\n* I \"failed\" 5 HM screens, but quite frankly it would have never worked due to personality differences so that's fine.\n* A few ghostings randomly in the middle of rounds, so I will never know\n* 85% pass rate on presentations. I think the failures were my fault: I was either too verbose or too succinct for the given audience.\n* 14 offer rounds. 9 of those were \"we promoted someone from the inside\" or \"we had another candidate\". It was really upsetting to hear when it was due to another candidate and I have looked several of the companies up to see who they hired. In retrospect I am glad it didn't work out as they hired people who were more junior in experience, but prolific on spam posting on Medium and LinkedIn about their knowledge despite never having been in an actual role for longer than 2 years and never in a Senior or Staff role for more than 1.5. Their loss, not mine.\n* 5 quality offers. I passed on one due to insanely short relocation turnaround, another was too junior of a role and it did not align, and the other pass just a role that I honestly don't think I would have been happy in. The remaining 2 are the one I accepted and the one I mentioned above when I was ghosted.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\n  \nRecently had a common problem, where I had to improve the speed of my code 5x, to get to benchmark performance needed for production level code in my company.\n\nLong story short, OCR model scans a document and the goal is to identify which file from the folder with 100,000 files the scan is referring to.\n\n  \nI used a bag-of-words approach, where 100,000 files were encoded as a sparse matrix using scipy. To prepare the matrix, CountVectorizer from scikit-learn was used, so I ended up with a 100,000 x 60,000 sparse matrix. \n\nTo evaluate the number of shared words between the OCR results, and all files, there is a \"minimum\" method implemented, which performs element-wise minimum operation on matrices of the same shape. To use it, I had to convert the 1-dimensional vector encoding the word count in the new scan, to a huge matrix consisting of the same row 100,000 times.\n\nOne way to do it is to use the \"vstack\" from Scipy, but this turned out to be the bottleneck when I profiled the script. Got the feedback from the main engineer that it has to be below 100ms, and I was stuck at 250ms. \n\nLong story short, there is another way of creating a \"large\" sparse matrix with one row repeated, and that is to use the [kron](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.kron.html#scipy.sparse.kron) method (stands for \"Kronecker product\"). After implementing, inference time got cut to 80ms. \n\n  \nOf course, I left a lot of the details out because it would be too long, but the point is that a somewhat obscure fact from mathematics (I knew about the Kronecker product) got me the biggest performance boost.\n\nA.I. was pretty useful, but on its own wasn't enough to get me down below 100ms, had to do old style programming!!\n\n  \nAnyway, thanks for reading. I posted this because first I wanted to ask for help how to improve performance, but I saw that the rules don't allow for that. So instead, I'm writing about a neat solution that I found. ",

In practice, a lot of ML code misses benchmarks because of exactly this kind of hidden allocation or replication step. I have seen similar wins from avoiding explicit expansion and letting linear algebra do the work implicitly. It also highlights why profiling matters more than clever modeling once you are in production. Out of curiosity, did you consider alternatives like inverted indices or pruning before the comparison, or was the latency budget tight enough that you needed to stay fully vectorized?",

In other words, I was worried it would either:\n\n1. just count how many INDIVIDUAL words are shared (word either appears in both documents, or not), so 1 or 0 for each word,\n\n2. it would overcount how may times the word appears. For example, if \"banana\" appears in the OCR 3 times, and in the original document 3 times, I thought the dot product would give 9.\n\nLooking at the documentation for \"CountVectorizer\", this is written for the \"binary\" parameter:  \n  \n\"**binary** bool, default=False\n\nIf True, all non zero counts are set to 1. This is useful for discrete probabilistic models that model binary events rather than integer counts.\"\n\nSo, I'm worried about the #1 case, but I'll explore in more detail",

I never accept suggestions with more than 2 lines, because 2 lines is my limit for what I can check quickly for accuracy. Once I developed the initial method, AI helped me get the inference time from 2 seconds to roughly 0.5s, but then it started going into circles, either suggesting things that don't work or stuff that doesn't impact the execution time.\n\n  \nSince I had to get down to 100ms, I decided to drop my initial approach, which was basically a \"for\" loop (comparing the generated text with each record from DB individually), and to try vectorization/matrix operations.\n\n  \nI knew about scikit-learn, so I was reading the documentation until I stumbled upon [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#countvectorizer), which can encode all DB records into a single sparse matrix. Key calculation was finding the number of shared words between the scanned document and each record in the database, which can easily be done with the [minimum](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.16.2/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.minimum.html) function. The only thing missing was how to quickly run this function, because it requires two matrices of the same shape, but the OCR results is only a 1-dimensional sparse matrix. In order to generate a large matrix, AI suggested [vstack](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.vstack.html), which worked and got me down to roughly 250ms, without impacting accuracy. I ran the cProfile profiler on my script, and noticed that the vstack took the most time to execute, so I needed to cut it down. I was thinking about how to construct a large matrix where 1 row is repeated a number of times, reading scipy.sparse docs, looking for another option, and was very happy to see that the Kronecker product was implemented: [LINK](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.16.2/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.kron.html).\n\n  \nOverall, AI was pretty good, and it might have done more with better prompting, but I needed a significant change in approach, and I felt like I was just going in circles with AI, so had to rely on my own neural network",

The bar is legitimately high, and you'll need to be sharp on all fronts. That said, a month is actually plenty of time to prepare if you're strategic about it. Focus on practicing common [Google data science interview questions](https://www.interviews.chat/questions/google-data-scientist) that cover A/B testing scenarios, metric design, and how you'd approach ambiguous business problems. Get comfortable explaining your thought process out loud since they care as much about how you think as what you know.\n\nThe good news is that Google's interview structure is fairly predictable, and there's tons of information available from others who've been through it. You should be drilling SQL queries daily, revisiting probability and statistics fundamentals, and doing mock interviews where you talk through case studies. The product sense rounds can feel intimidating, but they're really just testing if you can think like a data scientist who partners with product teams - how would you measure success for a feature, what metrics matter, what could go wrong. If you put in focused preparation over the next few weeks, you'll walk in ready. This is absolutely doable for someone at the senior level - just treat the prep like a sprint, not a marathon.",

I’m actively upskilling and am currently working through DataCamp’s Associate Data Scientist with Python track, alongside building small projects. I intend on doing something similar for SQL and PowerBI. \n\nWhat I’m trying to understand from a hiring perspective is: What actually makes someone with a non-traditional background credible for an analytics role?\n\nIn particular, I’m unsure how much weight structured tracks like this really carry. Do you expect a career-switcher to “complete the whole ladder” (e.g. finish a full Python track, then a full SQL track, then Power BI, etc.) before you have confidence in them? Or is credibility driven more by something else entirely?\n\nI’m trying to avoid empty credential-collecting and focus only on what materially changes your hiring decision. From your perspective, what concrete signals move a candidate like me from “interesting background” to “this person can actually do the job”?",

Structured data-science programs are not necessarily superior (and in many ways can be *inferior*) to highly quantitative STEM fields in terms of DS skills. Often it's up to the student to steer their experience in the lab toward computational approaches, big-data analytics, etc. If you're on a microbiology PhD track, you'll likely find yourself doing data collection, statistical analyses, problem solving, project management, etc. at a high level as a threshold of satisfying your course requirements, publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and defending your dissertation. What will set you apart if you want to be a DS *outside* the normal industries into which microbio PhDs tend to gravitate is your ability to link those skills to the business cases that your target industry cares about.\n\nI would **not care** if you finished some micro-certification on Data Camp or similar. That's pure noise, IMHO. As a STEM PhD I would want to read your publications and discuss your methods in the context of my industry.",

I've been working specifically as a DS since 2015 but was working as a \"biometrician\" at a boutique environmental stats firm before that.\n\nEverything beyond my MS was in research, field work, and writing technical papers for peer review in fish and wildlife. I was an R expert (and still am, kinda) and although was not \"officially\" a statistician, I had a *very* deep background in mathematical modeling and frequentist stats. When I made the conscious decision to jump to \"industry\" instead of doing environmental work, I had the basics of SQL in my back pocket, thanks to having done a ton of data management at my boutique environmental firm.\n\n**What got me hired first was not the skillz but more how I approached a problem.** Bringing a different skill set to an organization is often times EXACTLY what a hiring manager wants, particularly if they get the signal that you're smart and can learn quickly. This is really all that matters: be smart and learn quickly and be able to show that you are or can do both. \n\nBe able to talk about models you know and how you could apply them. (For example, I applied nesting site fidelity models from sage grouse populations to predicting whether or new patients would return to a specific hospital. Same problem, different data and biz questions.) Be able to talk about how you apply stats. Be able to show how you write functions and think about how a model you've built locally could be handled by DevOps (or yourself) and moved into prod in \\[insert cloud provider of choice\\].\n\nAlthough Python is pretty much the currency of DS these days, there are still some R shops around and there are some good hiring managers left who are toolset agnostic, so long as the work is good and can be productionized. Python is easier to productionize and if you're already an R person, is pretty easy to pick up. Syntax differences can be funky, but aren't insurmountable.\n\nFeel free to reach out via DM with specific questions if you think I can help!",

Since then, my work has been split between two very different worlds:\n\n• Debugging nasty customer issues and weird edge cases in complex algorithms\n• C++ development on embedded systems (bug fixes, small features, integrations)\n\nNow my manager wants me to pick one path and specialize:\n\n1. Customer support and deep analysis\n   This is technically intense. I’m digging into edge cases, rare failures, and complex algorithm behavior. But most of the time I’m just tuning parameters, writing reports, and racing against brutal deadlines. Almost no real design or coding.\n\n2. Customer projects\n   More ownership and scope fewer fire drills. But a lot of it is integration work and following specs. Some algorithm implementation, but also the risk of spending months wiring things together.\n\nHere’s the problem:\nMy long-term goal is AI/ML and algorithm design. I want to build systems, not just debug them or glue components together.\n\nRight now, I’m worried about getting stuck in:\n\n\\* Support hell where I only troubleshoot\n\\* Or integration purgatory where I just implement specs\n\nIf you were in my shoes:\n\nWhich path actually helps you grow into AI/ML or algorithm roles?\nWhat would you push your manager for to avoid career stagnation?\n\nAny real-world advice would be hugely appreciated.\nThanks!\n\n",

Big tech companies might throw in some OOP and design patterns questions to assess your software engineering fundamentals, but they're usually not the main focus. Smaller companies or places where the MLE role is closer to a traditional SWE role might dig deeper into LLD. If you're already solid on DSA and ML system design, spending maybe 20-30% of your remaining prep time on basic OOP principles and common design patterns is reasonable insurance, but don't let it take priority over your core MLE prep.\n\nThe good news is that you don't need to go as deep as a backend engineer would - just understand the fundamentals like SOLID principles, a handful of common patterns (factory, strategy, observer), and how to write clean, maintainable code. Most interviewers care more about seeing that you can structure code reasonably than testing whether you've memorized every design pattern.

Less deadlines.  \n  \nMy long-term goal is AI, ML, and general algorithm design.

I have 5 years of experience in the insurance/reinsurance domain, working in catastrophe modeling, risk analytics, data cleaning, and geocoding using in house tools. My work has involved heavy data analysis, stakeholder interaction, and translating model outputs into business insights.\n\nI want to change domains and am evaluating two paths:\n\n1. MS abroad 2026 (Data Science / Analytics / related tech programs)\n2. MBA in India (to pivot into consulting / strategy / management roles)\n\nMy key questions: For someone at 5 years experience, which path offers a more realistic and sustainable domain switch? How do recruiters view prior domain experience in each case? Any regrets from people who chose MS vs MBA (or vice versa)? Are there risks of being “overqualified but underexperienced” in either path? My priority is long-term career satisfaction and growth, not just immediate compensation.\n\nThanks in advance...would really value insights from people who’ve faced a similar situation.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m currently working on a project using utility asset data (GIS / SAP / AMI) and I’m exploring whether this is a solid use case for introducing ML into a **customer-to-transformer matching audit** problem. The goal is to ensure that meters (each associated with a customer) are connected to the correct transformer.\n\n# Important context\n\n* Current customer → transformer associations are driven by a **location ID** containing circuit, address/road, and company (opco).\n* After an initial analysis, some associations appear wrong, but **ground truth is partial** and validation is expensive (field work).\n* The goal is **NOT** to auto-assign transformers.\n* The goal is to **prioritize which existing matches are most likely wrong**.\n\nI’m leaning toward framing this as a **probabilistic risk scoring** problem rather than a hard classification task, with something like **logistic regression** as a first model due to interpretability and governance needs.\n\n# Initial checks / predictors under consideration\n\n**1) Distance**\n\n* Binary distance thresholds (e.g., >550 ft)\n* Whether the assigned transformer is the **nearest** transformer\n* Distance ratio: distance to assigned vs. nearest transformer (e.g., nearest is 10 ft away but assigned is 500 ft away)\n\n**2) Voltage consistency**\n\n* Identifying customers with similar service voltage\n* Using voltage consistency as a signal to flag unlikely associations (challenging due to very high customer volume)\n\nModel output to be: \n\nP(current customer → transformer match is wrong)\n\n\n\nThis probability would be used to define operational tiers (auto-safe, monitor, desktop review, field validation).\n\n# Questions\n\n1. Does **logistic regression** make sense as a first model for this type of probabilistic audit problem?\n2. Any pitfalls when relying heavily on **distance + voltage** as primary predictors?\n3. When people move beyond logistic regression here, is it usually **tree-based models + calibration**?\n4. Any advice on **threshold / tier design** when labels are noisy and incomplete?",

Just watch out for geographic clustering effects messing with your distance assumptions (like rural vs urban transformer density)\n\n  \nFor thresholds with noisy labels, start conservative and let the field validation feedback tune your cutoffs over time rather than trying to optimize on incomplete ground truth upfront",

For most associations, correctness is  uncertain unless there’s been field validation (which is very costly). The way I’m thinking about it is to only train on a subset of high-confidence labels: confirmed field corrections where available, plus some very strong inferred cases (like extreme distance ratios with a clearly closer viable transformer). Everything in the gray area would stay unlabeled and only be scored. The intent is to rank/prioritize review, not to auto-correct matches. The new field validation would feed back as additional high-confidence labels, so the model and thresholds can be tuned iteratively",
