What seems to matter more is whether DS is tied to a real decision loop or just reporting. Teams where models inform or automate something concrete tend to have better incentives around data quality, infra, and career growth. In contrast, roles that sit downstream of the product with vague impact tend to get squeezed when budgets tighten. For 2026 specifically, I would look less at sector labels and more at signals like ownership of metrics, iteration speed, and whether DS is involved before decisions are made. Those usually tell you more than the brand name.",

You have three options\n\n1) accept that your notebook will no longer work, and eventually gets completely out of sync with the project to the point where it is unrecoverable.\n\n2) painstakingly refactor every notebook you wish to maintain every time you make a small to the codebase. It quickly becomes prohibitively long and annoying\n\n3) make all of your notebooks fully self-contained. Best solution, if the amount of local code required is not too big. Otherwise, some notebooks tend to grow so big you have to scroll for half an hour until you get to the actual line you want to run.\n\nCurrently, I believe that notebooks are strictly worse than anything one can do in basic python. Just have one switchboard file with a lot of imports, and comment some lines out as required before running, keeping all actual code in imported local function/class files\n\nA few more grievances: \n* Dynamic plots are completely unreliable. Yesterday I could do sliders with matplotlib with no issues, today you have to bend over backwards to get it to run on Jupyter. Yes, at the moment plotly works great, but what if that stops working too at some point in the future?\n* Files with large plots take ages to open, and can take a huge amount of space, preventing them from being checked into git. Yes, one can clear all content before checking it in, but that defeats the main selling point of a notebook, namely that one can just scroll though and understand what the notebook is about by looking at the plots. \n* Jupyter does not work with uv out of the box. One can run notebooks with local environments using VSCode, which is a godsend, but forces you into VSCode if you are normally using another ide.\n\nI would recommend newcomers bit to get too dependent on notebooks and use basic python instead",

Then you have the option to do multiple rounds of coarse-to-fine random search from there.\n\nIf you're training larger or more expensive models, this may be where you stop due to budget or time constraints. I would say this is a concern if you're using more heavy duty neural nets for nlp, vision etc. but not typically for xgboost. More searching [gives better expected results](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03004) if you can fit it in your budget.\n\nThen once you have confidence you've narrowed down the neighborhood you're looking in, you can try Bayesian optimization using the validation metrics collected so far as a starting point. This part is just squeezing out the last little bits of performance.\n\nHyper parameter tuning with different frameworks usually let you pick the number of runs per round and the first round will usually do a random search for you before moving to Bayesian optimization. Just make sure the number of models in the initial round is not too small.\n\nEdit: hyperlinks properly working",

If you're doing an exhaustive grid search, I would recommend using the different optimizer/search methods.  \nIt will likely take a fraction of the time with other methods, and even if you don't get the best of the best hyper parameters it'll likely only differ from the absolute best by an insignificant amount in terms of the metric you're using.\n\nFor relatively simple and small models, I find [Halving Grid Search ](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV) is a fast and simple way that gets decent enough results.

From the beginning, the hiring manager seemed a bit disinterested and it felt like he was chatting with someone else during the interview. At one point I even saw him smiling while I was talking, and I was not saying anything remotely amusing.\n\nThat really threw me off and I got distracted, which led to me not answering some questions as well as I should have. The questions were about my past experience, things I definitely knew, and I think that ultimately contributed to my rejection.\n\nI was really looking forward to interviewing there, and in hindsight I feel like I could have done much better, especially if I had prepared a bit more. Hindsight is always 20 20. How do you get over interviews like this?",

Try to extract one or two concrete lessons, like better prep for storytelling or strategies to stay grounded when the vibe feels off, and then consciously let the rest go. Replaying every moment usually just makes it heavier than it deserves to be.\n\nAlso, a single interview does not define your ability or your trajectory.

You can learn a lot by owning the last mile for a small system, even if it is unglamorous monitoring, data validation, or retraining logic. Startups can compress these roles, but rigor often gets traded for speed, so you end up learning workarounds more than good systems. the question I always ask is whether the model actually ships and stays alive six months later. If you want more data eng exposure, it usually helps to frame it as reliability and iteration, not career development. That tends to get buy-in faster.",

I live in the west so cost of living is not that high as in London. Is 70k a good salary for 5 YOE? I suspect I am still low for UK standards. How is the market for six figure DS jobs right now in the UK. I want to optimize for money from now on (single parent), so I'd like my next jump to be for 100k at least. Also how has your salary progression been for you UK folks?",

          "text": "No questions myself but wanted to open myself to questions for folks who are looking to transition into the field or grow their DS career. I’m a staff-level data scientist at a hyperscaler in SF that you have heard of. I’ve been in the field for 6 years now. I come from a non-conventional background (before DS I worked in various roles across warehouse ops for an ecommerce startup, management consulting, and finance). \n\n[please don’t message me for a referral - I typically only refer folks I can vouch for personally 🙏]\n\n\n- EQ > IQ. DS is a field that attracts a lot of smart, quiet introverts. Working on sociability, networking, and “putting yourself out there” returns far higher dividends than polishing your resume or gaining more and more tech skills. It may surprise you but speaking to folks at conferences, parties, or worst case LinkedIn messaging your school alumni can open lots of unexpected doors. \n- The same is true on the job. Surprise: people like working with those they like to be around. Landing impact and doing well in your data science role is 75% stakeholder management and 25% actually coding. The most successful DSes aren’t those with the best code, they’re those who can run the business. \n- Data science isn’t an entry level job. An entry level data scientist typically has at least a few years work experience in an adjacent role. I see a lot of folks coming from economic consulting, analytics, product management, and academia. The reason for this is that domain knowledge and business acumen are necessary to translate your technical work into a business result.\n- Breaking into data science can be somewhat random. My best advice for those not in the industry is to look for opportunities to use data science methods to improve processes or change the business wherever you currently work. I landed my first data science role because I started applying data science methods to inventory management, then moved on to support our ads team, and eventually got a new “analytics” job title. That cracked the door open for me to enter data science.",
