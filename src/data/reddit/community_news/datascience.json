You might have something similar for chairs, e.g., \"Chair\", \"Work chair\", \"Desk seating\", etc.  We have hundreds of product types, and they all have roughly similar descriptions but nothing standardized.\n\nI noodled on ways to group these for a while with various approaches - standardizing the text, looking for similarity between words and n-grams, using various algorithms for clustering  the text.  It turns out the easiest thing to do is to create a list of words that you expect like \"Chair\", \"Work surface\", \"Filing\", etc. and pass that with the description text to an LLM and have it return what word is closest to the description.  It can even give you a confidence, so you can find all the lowest confidence words, which usually means they aren't in your list, add those words to the list, and keep iterating until you more or less have a complete list of product types from the description.\n\nAfter it was all said and done, I grabbed a few hundred lines and manually checked them, and had about a 97% accuracy on product description to product group.  Which is pretty great vs the alternative of trying to manually classify these. \n\nThis saved me tons of time, and having standardized product descriptions has been a god send for all sorts of analyses with regards to pricing, vertical market, etc.",

          "text": "Communication. Technical knowledge or algo things are solveable parts. Collaboration is not, and on-point delivery is far more important than solving algo puzzles.\n\nFor example, if you think your chart is clear for outsider to read, trying to read r/dataisbeautiful and see if you can understand the basic/common charts, especially when you're not familiar with the terms/variables.\n\nThe same happened with non-technical stakeholders. Curse of expertise.\n\nThe other thing is to challenge stakeholders at first step. Always asking what's the reason for the ask. Often times, the question is not clear at the beginning. Many people don't know what they want, and frame the question as the wishlist 'Can you increase revenue...?', 'Can you analyze X for opportunities ...?, 'Can you improve X ...?'.... The question is far more important than the solutions.\n\nThe last important thing is to treat DS as a business product, not a scientific output. Product/business teams are not scientists. Scientists work to seek truth. Even then, the truths don't always stand the test of time. Newtons' laws of physics are true until centuries later. And it took almost 100 years before we could support Einstein 's relativity theory.\n\nDS teams in business are not creating new knowledge for truth. The ultimate goal is to create products to improve users/clients' lives.  It's important to be aware that our work are not truths. They are merely confirming or disconfirming evidence that either supports or refutes the viewpoint. The goal, also, is not seeking truth but to mitigate risks.",

There was a deeper dive into past projects, with interviewers probing why/how you chose certain models, handled ambiguity, demonstrated influence from end to end. LeetCode is still relevant, but generally more emphasis is placed on system design and cases (some companies have a separate round for this) to really zero in on your ability to articulate trade-offs. There's also advanced ML & stats knowledge typically not covered for more junior roles, iirc. Prep is definitely more different, and I can share some resources if you'd like.",

Can dive deep in one or two domains. \n\n  \nHow this manifests in the interview:\n\n\\* During an ML, Experimentation, or system design case study - needs little prompting to arrive at a good solution. Can articulate business constraints and methodology clearly. Is able to constructively react to feedback.   \n\\* Behavioral interviews - shows the ability to collaborate with other business functions. Can articulate several examples of leveraging ML expertise to deliver impact at a meaningful scale. \n\nWhen it comes to particulars - it should be fairly clear based on the interview description. It's worth asking the recruiter if there are any particular methodologies the company will focus on. But it's usually obvious from companies with experience hiring ML folks.\n\nI'd focus on really nailing the methodologies you articulate on your resume. And then review a handful of techniques from your education / personal reading. I'd also think about a few projects that demonstrate the above and type out a narrative.

I ultimately said I was a bit concerned that they lacked technical maturity and that they were facing some hype cycle issues along with them not forseeing some economic and contractual issues... and sure enough within the following weeks they lost a bunch of revenue due to Trump policies and canceled the position.    \n  \nMeanwhile I'm about burned out at my current position, particularly in this current administration - but given I got into machine learning and AI back in 2015 and started investing in 2017 and my previously modest portfolio blew up to multi-millions thanks to NVDA, I've frankly been de-risking and de-prioritizing everything, moving tranches of NVDA stock to safer investments before the AI bubble deflates.  I could leave the profession and live comfortably, and I frankly think I need a break from it.  Frankly it's a bit bizarre to me to be dealing with senior agency officials who get promotions and appointments and then when something AI-related comes up, I set them straight, and they dismissively say \"oh, you know something about this\" and I lay out 10 years of applied work in the field, edge cases and they start getting uncomfortable realizing they don't know anywhere near as much as I do about it.\n\nMeanwhile I have mixed feelings, my kid followed my path into data science, started doing ML in high school with astrophysics, got a degree in data science along with minors in political science and computer science and a geospatial concentration, but the market seems so saturated, skewed and screwed right now, my kid saw that as well, so went on to grad school and is currently pursuing, of all things, a law degree despite all the hype about how AI will take over the legal profession.  BUT, who will be the humans involved, who will be steering AI ethics and digital governance, privacy rights, legislation and so on?  Certainly all that doesn't just get left to random people asking LLMs their half-baked questions.  Who is asking the bigger questions and figuring out the answers that an LLM would first need to be trained on?",

          "text": "Most ML interviews don't actually ask you to write out formal mathematical proofs on a whiteboard - they want to see that you understand the intuition and can explain why certain things work the way they do. The examples you mentioned are more about showing conceptual understanding than rigorous proof-writing. Companies care more about whether you can explain why MSE with a sigmoid creates multiple local minima, or why minimizing within-cluster variance naturally leads to using the mean. If you can walk through the logic clearly and show you understand the underlying math, that's usually enough. Focus on being able to derive and explain gradient descent, the bias-variance tradeoff, why regularization works, how different loss functions behave, and the assumptions behind common algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, and SVMs.\n\nThat said, some research-heavy roles or quant positions might dig deeper into formal derivations, so it's worth practicing the classics: deriving the closed-form solution for linear regression, showing convexity of log loss, proving convergence properties of simple optimization algorithms, and understanding maximum likelihood estimation. The key is being able to explain your reasoning out loud as you work through it - interviewers want to see your thought process, not a memorized proof. If you're worried about handling these kinds of questions on the spot, I built [AI assistant for interviews](http://interviews.chat) with my team to help people respond to tough technical questions like these in real-time, so you can get comfortable explaining complex concepts under pressure.",

Or find DS roles that are about signal processing, like DS related to Hardware, or Bayer Crops has information from sensors.\n\nYes, research with a professor would strengthen your profile. And yes, it would be better to do that versus a \"self-directed project\". Work with a professor is better because it has a stamp of approval and also, professors have high standards and don't just take anyone. Having an RA is a lot of work for the professor because it's not like you can do everything on your own and you need supervision. So if they take it, it means you are already better than the average student. It's a strong signal on a resume. Anyone can make their own lame projects, but very few have research experience or even publications. Even a poster at a conference would be great.\n\nNo, masters in DS would not help. Probably one in ML or computer science would be better, but I would try to get a job before doing that.\n\nTry doing an official cloud certification and a project using that cloud platform first.\n\nMaybe a C++ official certification could be good for a SWE / MLE route. Some languages have official certifications from their 'institutes' and C++ is one of them. I would ask if that's helpful in one of the swe reddits.\n\nThe reason why I'm discouraging against DS is because the gap between MLE and DS is broadening, and many DS jobs are going into Analytics jobs. Your profile is closer to SWE / MLE. Also, for new grads, it's a lot 'easier' to get new grad jobs in SWE. It's hard but it's a LOT easier than getting one in DS which is nearly impossible and also, DS would put you further away from the type of jobs you'd want.

      "text": "Built this because I needed to extract text from enterprise SharePoint dumps for RAG pipelines, and the existing options were painful:\n\n* **LibreOffice-based**: 1GB+ container images, headless X11 setup\n* **Apache Tika**: Java runtime, 500MB+ footprint\n* **subprocess wrappers**: security concerns, platform issues\n\n`sharepoint-to-text` parses Office binary formats (OLE2) and OOXML directly in Python. Zero system dependencies.\n\n**What it handles:**\n\n* Legacy Office: `.doc`, `.xls`, `.ppt`\n* Modern Office: `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`\n* OpenDocument: `.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`\n* PDF, Email (`.eml`, `.msg`, `.mbox`), HTML, plain text formats\n\n**Basic usage:**\n\npython\n\n    import sharepoint2text\n    \n    result = next(sharepoint2text.read_file(\"document.docx\"))\n    text = result.get_full_text()\n    \n    # Or iterate by page/slide/sheet for RAG chunking\n    for unit in result.iterate_units():\n        chunk = unit.get_text()\n\nAlso extracts tables, images, and metadata. Has a CLI. JSON serialization built in.\n\n**Install:** `uv add sharepoint-to-text` or `pip install sharepoint-to-text`\n\n**Trade-offs to be aware of:**\n\n* No OCR - scanned PDFs return empty text\n* Password-protected files are rejected\n* Word docs don't have page boundaries (that's a format limitation, not ours)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/Horsmann/sharepoint-to-text](https://github.com/Horsmann/sharepoint-to-text)\n\nHappy to answer questions or take feedback.",

There are many text extraction libraries but many don't support the legacy file formats and putting sharepoint in the name I hoped to clarify why I think this is necessary and what the selling point is. \n\nI see the point though. I may add this in the future but it complicates the setup as you need a sharepoint and azure entra-id to test this properly and its also tricky to foresee cybersecurity measures in companies which limit or restrict api-access to sharepoints",

If two features are highly correlated but only one is interpretable or actionable for the use case, dropping the other may reduce complexity without changing what anyone would do differently.\nCurious how you think about that tradeoff when model performance and decision usefulness don’t perfectly align.",
