I mainly work on SQL, Pandas, Power BI dashboards, credit risk modeling, MLOps, and a small part of GenAI architecture using Redis workers.\n\nI have been invited to my college, where I completed my Masters in Data Science, to give a guest lecture in the first week of March. I chose the topic “end to end ML building” where I plan to talk about:\n\n* Data validation using pandera\n* Feature store\n* Model training\n* Model serving using fastapi\n* Automation using airflow\n* Model monitoring\n* Containerization using docker\n\nI am comfortable teaching this because I use many of these tools at work and in personal projects.\n\nHowever, I am worried about one thing. Students may ask me about AI replacing jobs. They will graduate next year and they might ask:\n\n* Will there still be jobs?\n* Will our skills still be valuable?\n* Is AI removing entry level roles?\n\nEven I sometimes feel uncertain. Tools like claude and other AI systems are becoming very powerful. I am trying to learn advanced skills like production ML pipelines to stay relevant. hoping these harder skills will keep me relevant longer.\n\nBut I am not sure how to confidently answer students when they ask about job security. i don't want to scare them.\n\nI need guidance on what I should tell them about the future of AI and jobs.",

I think it's more of an excuse being used because it looks cool for investors; in the meantime, hiring in India has been going up so many roles were replaced. \n\nI think your presentation might give them an incorrect understand of all of the roles there are. I think a lot of the work you might present is moving to MLE which, not only is not a first job, it requires SWE skills. \n\nI disagree with telling them to focus on \"advanced skills such as building an end-to-end system\". I think that: \n\n(1) There are many types of roles (DA, DS, MLE), areas out there (Product, Growth, Go to Market), industries (tech, finance, healthcare, etc.) They need to find what's the best fit for them. \n\n(2) Many of the \"advanced skills\" roles are being taken by SWE. Also, I've been interviewing a lot and companies that ask about anything for deploying models, etc., are start-ups. They also have take homes and if you move beyond that, like bigger companies, they call the role MLE. These roles are very difficult to get and they require a lot of prep for system design interviews. I wouldn't recommend this for people who are finishing a masters in DS unless they come from SWE. \n\nThat said, yes, having skills helps get you to the door, but even in full stack DS interviews they are going to ask you fro basic python/SQL coding interview, product sense, etc. in interviews. So spending hours and hours on a project and investing in the skills you mentioned is kind of a waste. They should be preparing for interviews first and if they have no business or product sense, they are not going to pass any interview screening.\n\nMy advice would (1), to find what they are a good fit for and have a coherent resume. Not sell themselves as someone who can do everything and anything. \n\n",

It gets smarter at creating code because it also understands math, statistics/ML better, but it is still a human that asks for a task that needs to be done and it still a human that will use the output. Legally only a human can be responsible for the output at the moment.\n\nI still see plenty of jobs for people who understands and can descibe what they want. Humans still needs to give context and have a vision of the output.\n\nSo less focus on coding but still relevant to have the right background/experiance.\n\nMy background is in Chemical engineering and now I work with a mix of data analysis/science and change management. That have really only been possible the last two years with AI where I moved more of my automation and analysis over to python.

The answer was always \"yes\" because we live in an online world and undertstanding data is the only way to navigate it. Data are difficult to interpret and so you will need people who can do that.\n\n10 years ago, if you could fit a model then that was enough to enter the field, that's still valued, but there are other skills like being able to select metrics, diagnose dashboard changes, set up experiments, influence roadmaps with recommendations over what to build next and so on.\n\nThere's a bunch of research that says that AI is having an impact, but there are other economic factors at play as well. It's never easy to start your career and it's definitely more challenging than ever but there's also more information and strategy to do so than ever as well.\n\nYes, it's worth being anxious about, but the solution to anxiety is being able to create a strategy strong enough to get you through the challenges ahead.

Usually the Q&A part will be a lot of questions about the job market.\n\nI'm always honest with them, but I don't want to be all doom and gloom. I let them know that the job market is very competitive, but I pair that with advice - encourage them to spend time networking, to go to local industry events, do something other than go to class (lead a student group, do research with your prof, etc). They love my slide with all of the different job titles and search terms because all they really know is \"data scientist\" or \"data analyst\".\n\nI also stress that this field is always evolving. It's changed in the 10 years since I started working in data, it's changed in the past 3 years since the job market turned around, and it's changed in the past 2 years since AI started booming. And it's going to keep changing in ways that I probably won't expect. New jobs will pop up - in the past few years, we've gotten Analytics Engineer, DevOps, and Data Science is more specialized into inference/experimentation, ML research, ML Eng, ML Ops, etc. Heck Data Science didn't even exist when I started my career 20+ years ago. So who knows what jobs will become available.\n\nSo you have to expect for any career that things are going to change and you'll have to keep adapting. Analytics/DS is my second career, I spent the first 10 years in marketing, and even that went through a lot of changes - the people who were adaptable survived, and the people who wanted to keep \"doing things the way I've always done them\" didn't.

                  "text": "I was totally joking but thats is hilarious. It doesnt come across as AI slop at all and theres nothing wrong with usisng AI assisted communication. In the spirit of that, I asked two different LLMs the question in your post:\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.6:\n\n>This is a genuinely hard question, and the fact that you feel uncertain is actually a sign you're thinking about it honestly rather than just reciting talking points. Here's how I'd frame it.\n\n>**First, acknowledge the uncertainty openly.** Students will respect you more for saying \"I don't have a crystal ball\" than for being falsely reassuring. The honest answer is that nobody knows exactly how this plays out. But uncertainty isn't the same as doom.\n\n>**What you can say with confidence:**\n\n>The skills you're teaching them — data validation, feature stores, model serving, monitoring, pipelines — are precisely the skills that AI tools *cannot* replace easily right now, and likely won't for a while. Here's why: AI is very good at generating code snippets, answering questions, drafting dashboards. It is not good at understanding *why* a model is drifting in production, *why* your feature store is returning stale values, or *why* a credit risk model is behaving unexpectedly in a new market segment. Those require judgment built from real experience. That's what they're learning to develop.\n\n>**On entry-level roles specifically** — yes, some tasks that used to define entry-level jobs are being automated. This is real and worth acknowledging. But the historical pattern with technology is that it tends to shift what entry-level work *looks like* rather than eliminate the need for junior people entirely. Junior engineers in the 2000s spent a lot of time on tasks that are now trivial. Instead, they were pushed toward higher-leverage work earlier. The same shift is happening now. Entry-level data scientists will likely spend less time on boilerplate EDA and more time learning to evaluate model behavior, write good evals, and manage ML systems in production.\n\n>**The reframe you can offer them** — and that genuinely helped me think about this — is that AI is raising the floor of what a capable person can produce, but it's also raising the bar for what's expected. Someone who uses AI tools effectively and understands production ML systems is more valuable than someone who can only write clean notebooks. The students in that room, graduating with exposure to MLOps concepts, are already positioning themselves better than most.\n\n>**Your own story is the most powerful thing you can share.** You're two years in, you felt the uncertainty too, and your response was to go deeper into production skills that require real judgment. That's the right instinct, and you can tell them that directly. Not as a guarantee, but as a strategy: go toward the harder, more contextual, more production-oriented skills because those are the ones that require the kind of situated understanding that's harder to automate.\n\n>**One practical thing to tell them:** Learn to use AI tools fluently *as part of* building these pipelines. A data scientist who can use Claude or Copilot to accelerate their work while still understanding what's happening under the hood is significantly more productive than one who can't. That combination — tool fluency plus genuine systems understanding — is what you want to be.\n\n>The honest summary you could close with: *\"I can't promise you job security. Nobody can. What I can tell you is that the people I see thriving are the ones who go deeper on systems-level thinking and learn to work with AI rather than feel threatened by it. That's what I'm trying to do, and it's part of why I'm teaching you these topics today.\"*\n\n>That's more credible than false confidence, and it's also true.\n\nand ChatGPT (free version)\n\nFirst of all — congratulations. Getting invited back within \\~2 years of graduating means you’re already doing something right.\n\nNow let’s talk about the *real* concern.\n\nYou’re not worried about the technical content.  \nYou’re worried about standing in front of students and being asked:\n\n* “Will there still be jobs?”\n* “Is AI replacing us?”\n* “Are entry-level roles disappearing?”\n* “Are we learning things that will become irrelevant?”\n\nThat’s not a technical question.  \nThat’s a responsibility question.\n\nAnd the good news? You can answer it honestly **without being overly optimistic or pessimistic**.\n\n# 1️⃣ First — Separate Hype from Reality\n\nTools like Claude, GPT, Copilot, etc. feel disruptive.  \nBut remember something important:\n\nEvery major automation wave feels like this.\n\n* Spreadsheets were supposed to kill accountants.\n* AutoML was supposed to kill data scientists.\n* Cloud was supposed to kill infra jobs.\n* No-code tools were supposed to kill developers.\n\nInstead:  \nJobs changed. They didn’t vanish.\n\nThe role of a data professional is shifting from:\n\n>\n\nto:\n\n>\n\nThat is much harder to automate.\n\n# 2️⃣ Here’s the Honest Answer You Can Give\n\nIf a student asks: *“Will there still be jobs?”*\n\nYou can say something like:\n\n>\n\nThis is aligned with what you're already doing:\n\n* Data validation (pandera)\n* Feature stores\n* MLOps\n* Monitoring\n* Airflow pipelines\n* Docker\n\nThose are *not* easily automated skills.\n\nAI can help write a function.\n\nIt cannot:\n\n* Diagnose bad data distribution shifts.\n* Design a monitoring strategy.\n* Align models with business risk tolerance.\n* Own a failed deployment in production.\n* Communicate with stakeholders.\n\nThat’s the part that stays human.\n\n# 3️⃣ Are Entry Level Roles Being Affected?\n\nThis is where nuance matters.\n\nSome *traditional* entry-level tasks are shrinking:\n\n* Basic dashboard building\n* Simple SQL extraction\n* Writing boilerplate ML code\n* Minor ETL scripts\n\nYes — AI makes these faster.\n\nBut here's the shift:\n\nEntry-level expectations are rising.\n\nEarlier:\n\n>\n\nNow:\n\n>\n\nThe floor is rising.  \nThe ceiling is rising even faster.\n\nAnd that’s exactly why your lecture topic is powerful.\n\n# 4️⃣ The Frame You Should Use During the Lecture\n\nInstead of defending against AI fear, anchor the conversation like this:\n\n# “AI is automating tasks, not ownership.”\n\nThere’s a big difference between:\n\n* Executing instructions and\n* Owning systems\n\nCompanies don’t hire people to write `fit()`.\n\nThey hire people to:\n\n* Reduce credit risk\n* Improve fraud detection\n* Increase revenue\n* Reduce downtime\n* Manage compliance\n\nAI does not take accountability.\n\nHumans do.\n\nAnd accountability creates jobs.\n\n# 5️⃣ You Can Share Your Own Strategy (Without Fear)\n\nYou don’t need to act invincible.\n\nYou can say:\n\n>\n\nThat makes you relatable, not weak.\n\nStudents trust speakers who admit uncertainty but show strategy.\n\n# 6️⃣ The Most Important Point You Can Tell Them\n\nThe future will reward:\n\n# 1. Systems Thinkers\n\nNot just model builders — pipeline architects.\n\n# 2. Business Translators\n\nPeople who connect ML to ROI and risk.\n\n# 3. Engineers Who Can Ship\n\nProduction > notebooks.\n\n# 4. People Who Use AI as a Multiplier\n\nNot compete against it.\n\n# 7️⃣ A Strong Closing Line You Can Use\n\nIf you want something powerful to end with:\n\n>\n\nOr:\n\n>\n\n# 8️⃣ Reality Check (For You)\n\nYour anxiety is actually a good sign.\n\nIt means:\n\n* You’re thinking long term.\n* You’re not complacent.\n* You’re already upgrading your skillset.\n\nYou moved beyond:  \nSQL + Dashboards  \nto  \nEnd-to-End ML + Deployment + Monitoring.\n\nThat’s not replaceable-level work.\n\nYou’re not trying to survive the AI wave.  \nYou’re learning to surf it.\n\n\n\n  \nFunny enough there is some wisdom in both those responses. My personal view is kinda a hot take but even the best agentic models really aren't that great at writing code.",

          "text": "These are just my opinion, but some of my answers to the questions.\n\n> Will there still be jobs?\n\nYes, because an important part about being a data scientist in the industry is ownership. When you pick up a model, or make a model, you are accountable for it's performance. A manager with no DS experience could ask it basic questions, but they wouldn't understand what to tell the AI to make. Coding by hand will probably happen less and less, but you should be driving your products yourself.\n\n> Will our skills still be valuable?\n\nAbsolutely. You should understand conceptually what each model does for you, is the data good enough, how to explain it, etc.. As they would understand, a neural network is built with all this information inside of it, but it can't pull the right information without being asked the right questions. There's a difference between asking an LLM \"Make me something that predicts house prices\" vs \"Design the base for a linear regression model to predict house prices given their location, num bedrooms, ... and run cross validation to optimize it's hyperparameters.\"\n\n> Is AI removing entry level roles?\n\nThis is probably more true for software engineering than data science. If you are being hired as a data scientist, you are off the bat already expected to know how to build features and make models on your own. You probably wouldn't have a bunch of pre-defined tasks handed to you. Data science jobs are more open ended, so I wouldn't say AI necessarily replaced them. Jobs replaced by AI I think are more grunt-work.",

      "text": "Hey folks, this is an update from my previous post ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1qt2hhe/my_thoughts_on_my_recent_interview_experiences_in/)). You might also remember me for my previous posts about how to pass product analytics interviews in tech, and how to pass AB testing/Experimentation interviews. For context, I was laid off last year, took \\~7 months off, and started applying for jobs on Jan 1 this year. I've since completed final round interviews at 3 tech companies and am waiting on offers. The types of roles I applied for were product analytics roles, so the titles are like: Data Scientist, Analytics or Product Data Scientist or Data Scientist, Product Analytics. These are not ML or research roles. I was targeting senior/staff level roles.\n\n  \nI'm just going to talk about the final round interviews here since my previous post covered what the tech screens were like.\n\n  \n**MAANG company:**\n\n4 rounds:\n\n* 1 in depth SQL round. The questions were a bit more ambiguous. For example, instead of asking you to calculate Revenue per year and YoY percent change in revenue, they would ask something like \"How would you determine if the business is doing well?\" Or instead of asking you to calculate the % of customers that made a repeat purchase in the last 30 days, they would ask \"How would you decide if customers are coming back or not?\"\n* 1 round focused more on stats and probability. This was a product case interview (e.g. This metric is going down, why do you think that is?)  with stats sprinkled in. If you asked them the right questions, they would give you some more data and information and ask you to calculate the probability of something happening\n* 1 round focused purely on product case study. E.g. We are thinking of launching this new feature, how would you figure out if it's a good idea? Or we launched this new product, how would you measure it's success?\n   * I didn't have to go super deep into technical measurement details. It was more about defining what success means and coming up with metrics to measure success\n* 1 round focused on behavioral. I was asked examples of projects where I influenced cross-functionally and about how I use AI.\n\nAll rounds were conducted by data scientists. I ended up getting an offer here but I just found out, so I don't have any hard numbers yet.\n\n  \n**Public SaaS company** (not MAANG):\n\n4 rounds:\n\n* 1 round where they gave me some charts and asked me to tell them any insights I saw. Then they gave me some data and I was asked to use that data to dig into why the original chart they showed me had some dips and spikes. I ended up creating some visualizations, cohorted by different segmentations (e.g. customer type, plan type, etc.)\n* 1 round where they asked me about a project that I drove end-to-end, and they asked me a bunch of questions about that one project. They also asked me to reflect on how I could have improved it or done better if I could do it again\n* 1 round focused on product case study. It was basically \"we are thinking of launching this new product, how would you measure success?\". This one got deeper into experimentation and causal inference\n* 1 round focused on behavioral. This one was surprising because they didn't ask me any \"tell me about a time\" questions. I was asked to walk through my resume, starting from the first job that I had listed on there. They did ask me why I was interested in the company and what I was looking for next. It seemed like they were mostly assessing whether I'd be a good fit from a behavioral standpoint, and whether I would be at risk of leaving soon after joining. This was the only interview conducted by someone other than a data scientist.\n\nHaven't heard back from this place yet.\n\n  \n**Private FinTech company:**\n\n4 rounds\n\n* 1 round focused on stats. It was a product case study about \"hey this metric is going down, how would you approach this\", but as the interview went on, they would reveal more information. I was shown output from linear and logistic regression and asked to interpret it, explain the caveats, how I would explain the results to non-technical stakeholders, and how I would improve the regression analyses. To be honest, since I hadn't worked for several months, I am a bit rusty on logistic regression so I didn't remember how to interpret log odds. I was also shown some charts and asked to extract any insights, as well as how would I improve the chart visually. I was also briefly asked about causal inference techniques. This interview took a lot of time because there were so many questions that they asked. They went super deep into the case study, usually my other case study interviews were at a more superficial level.\n* 1 round with a cross-functional partner. It was part case study (we are thinking of investing in building this new feature, how would you determine if it's worth the investment), part asking about my background.\n* 1 round with a hiring manager. I was asked about my resume, how I like to work, and a brief case study\n* 1 round with a cross-functional partner. This was more behavioral, typical \"tell me about a time\" question. \n\nHaven't heard back from this place yet.\n\n  \n**Overall thoughts**\n\nThe MAANG interview was the easiest, I think because there are just so many resources and anecdotes online that I knew pretty much what to expect. The other two companies had far fewer resources online so I didn't know what to expect. I also think general product case study questions are very \"crackable\". I am going to make another post on how I prepared for case study interview questions and provide a framework for the 5 most common types of case study questions. It's literally just a formula that you can follow. Companies are starting to ask about AI usage, which I was not prepared for. But after I was asked about AI usage once, I prepared a story and was much better prepared the next time I was asked about how I use AI. The hardest interview for me was definitely the interview where they went deep into linear/logistic regression and causal inference (fixed effects, instrumental variables), primarily because I've been out of work for so long and hadn't looked at any regression output in months. \n\n\n\nAnyways, just thought I'd share my experiences for those who having upcoming interviews in tech for product analytics roles in case it's helpful. If there's interest, I'll make another post with all the offers I get and the numbers (hopefully I get more than one). What I can say is that comp is down across the board. The recruiters shared rough ranges (see my previous post for the ranges), and they are less than what I made 2-3 years ago, despite targeting one level up from where I was before. \n\nWhenever I make these posts, I usually get a lot of questions about how I get interviews....I am sorry, but I really don't have much advice for how to get interviews. I am lucky enough to already have had a big name tech company on my resume, which I'm sure is how I get call backs from recruiters. Of the 3 final rounds that I had, 2 were from a recruiter reaching out on Linkedin and 1 was from a referral. I did have initial recruiter screens and tech screens from my cold applications, but I didn't end up getting final rounds from those. Good luck to everyone looking for jobs and I hope this helps. ",

There just aren't that many that are anywhere near a decent fit for me. This includes local and remote. \n\nI finished up a job search late last year for senior data scientist position. While the search ended relatively quickly (about 20 applications) I could definitely see a scenario where I can apply to 100 or even 200 positions if I was \"flexible\" with regard to the role matching my skills, but I don't think there's any way I can find 1200 positions unless I was willing to move.\n\nAlso, did you require some kind of sponsorship?

          "text": "Learn how performance reviews work at your company. Not just the regular 1-1 review meetings you have with your manager, but how often management comes together to discuss employees, and how they calibrate across people and teams. This matters a great deal for bonuses and awards, as well as how sought after you will be for internal advancement opportunities beyond your current immediate team. In previous organizations I've been at, performance calibrations sometimes were \"loudest voice led\" (managers who pushed hardest for their people would end up with them on top), and sometimes was \"popularity contest\" (employees who had good relationships with many managers or happened to do highly visible work were rewarded, employees whose work wasn't as visible and were unknowns to other managers not distinguished).\n\nKeep a running list of work accomplishments, and discuss them regularly with your manager. It will help you with those performance review and bonus processes as well as to keep your resume updated. \n\nGather as many advocates in your corner as possible beyond your own manager. If your manager is not very engaged, having others (especially department leaders and senior execs) who think highly of your work is critical for internal mobility and reducing the risk you'll be hit in a layoff.\n\nBeyond your accomplishments, time management, communication skills, and personality matter a lot for how you will be perceived. Learn what \"done\" actually means for your work and make sure you account for time for review and feedback, fixing issues, and handling unanticipated follow-ups. If you are working on something other people have dependencies on, make sure you are communicating status and why you might be delayed so you don't piss a lot of people off. Do not put yourself in a position where people can point to you as a scapegoat. Don't use technical jargon or get too in the weeds in front of an audience who doesn't care and will tune out. Use the same terminology as your business partners do. Aim for simplicity and brevity in your visualizations, presentations, emails, and reports, but don't be condescending, treat colleagues like dumb-dumbs, or mansplain. For meetings, show that you are respecting people's time and not tuning out, such as by being active in the chat with support and questions or keeping your camera on so that the meeting runners aren't seeing a bunch of lifeless muted black squares.",

However, for data scientists in particular, our personality and our ability to interact well with others, especially non-technical folks, is critical. \n\nFor some people this will sound pointless for others this will sound obvious, but it's really important that people actually enjoy working with you and being around you if you want to progress in your career.  You could be a technical master, but nobody wants to be around an asshole.  More importantly, they will only tolerate you for as long as they need to tolerate you and will drop you at the first opportunity if you have a poor personality. \n\nI saw this first hand in my first data science position. There was a senior guy who was extraordinarily technically competent, but he was a complete prick to EVERYONE except his boss. This guy had such a reputation as being a jerk that even Brown technical folks on the business side I thought he was a jerk, and they shouldn't have had that much contact with him. The problem was once his boss left people started maneuvering to get him canned too. \n\nIn contrast, if you got a good personality and maintain a positive attitude people will enjoy working with you and will look to you to help solve their problem, because they like you and trust you. This is especially true for the non-technical business folks when they interact with us. I've been called into meetings over seniors because the business leads knew me entrusted me and didn't know them.  This also leads to my second point. \n\nSometimes visibility is a literal thing. \n\nI love remote work, but I also got to see first hand at my last job how if there are two data scientists and one's remote and the other isn't the non remote data scientist is going to have a lot more opportunities to make a positive impression on leadership and business partners.  My previous team was remote but I was able to go into the office since I lived in the same city. Even though the other data scientists on the team work just as hard as me or harder she had nowhere near the visibility. \n\nThe results showed up in our performance reviews, particularly when leveling occurred where Managers from different parts of the business get together to standardize scores amongst employees.  She would tell me about how one of our directors seems to not like her and I would be perplexed because that director loved me. The problem was she was just a voice on teams and I was a face in the office. \n\nIf I was looking for career progression my ideal setup would be one to two days in the office where I could work closely with the non-technical business folks.  You really don't need more than that in the office to make an impression, certainly not 5 days. Folks just need to be able to SEE YOU as someone that they can work with and rely on.",

How do you manage dependencies?\n1. Do you use containers in place of environments?\n1. Do you do personal projects in a cloud/distributed environment?  \n  \nMy version of python got a little too stale and the conda solver froze to where I couldn't update/replace the solver, python, or the broken packages. This happened while I was doing a takehome project for an interview:,)  \nSo I have to uninstall anaconda and python anyway.  \n  \nI worked at a FAANG company for 5 years, so I'm used to production environment best practices, but a lot of what I used was in-house, heavily customized, or simply overkill for personal projects. I've deployed models in production, but my use cases have mostly been predictive analytics and business tooling.  \n  \nI have ADHD so I don't like having to worry about subscriptions, tokens, and server credits when I am just doing things to learn or experiment.

I don't use notebooks\n\nHow do I use it?\n\n1. I spend most of my time writing ML pipelines that feed our (SAAS) product. Scheduled tasks for training data ETL, training, monitoring and sometimes inference. Other times if it's something where we need inference in response to user action, either a lambda or a dedicated server depending on the usage patterns.\n2. I have kind of a love-hate relationship with vscode. Some of my projects are a mix of python and rust (PyO3), so it's nice having language support for both in the same editor, and the sqltools extension is great. The python debugger is pretty good. But the language servers randomly shit themselves like twice a week. And I wish copilot autocomplete was hooked into intellisense so that it would suggest functions and parameters that actually exist instead of just guessing.\n3. uv and pyproject.toml. almost all my stuff is containerized so it's pretty straightforward.\n4. In production yeah, but locally I always work in virtual environments. I always have at least one dependency group that's not used in production with ruff/pytest/pyright/stub packages.\n5. I don't really do personal projects. I'm lucky enough to be in an industry where my actual work is what my personal projects would be if I had a different job.\n\nIf you've been dealing with conda headaches and are looking for a new setup I *highly* recommend checking out uv. \n\n",

      "text": "Shameless promotion -- I have recently released a book, [Large Language Models for Mortals: A Practical Guide for Analysts](https://crimede-coder.com/blogposts/2026/LLMsForMortals).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7t71ql8ek9jg1.png?width=3980&format=png&auto=webp&s=1870a49ec6030cad49c364062c02cf5da166993f\n\nThe book is focused on using foundation model APIs, with examples from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and AWS in each chapter. The book is compiled via Quarto, so all the code examples are up to date with the latest API changes. The book includes:\n\n* Basics of LLMs (via creating a small predict the next word model), and some examples of calling local LLM models from huggingface (classification, embeddings, NER)\n* An entry chapter on understanding the inputs/outputs of the API. This includes discussing temperature, reasoning/thinking, multi-modal inputs, caching, web search, multi-turn conversations, and estimating costs\n* A chapter on structured outputs. This includes k-shot prompting, parsing JSON vs using pydantic, batch processing examples for all model providers, YAML/XML examples, evaluating accuracy for different prompts/models, and using log-probs to get a probability estimate for a classification\n* A chapter on RAG systems: Discusses semantic search vs keyword via plenty of examples. It also has actual vector database deployment patterns, with examples of in-memory FAISS, on-disk ChromaDB, OpenAI vector store, S3 Vectors, or using DB processing directly with BigQuery. It also has examples of chunking and summarizing PDF documents (OCR, chunking strategies). And discusses precision/recall in measuring a RAG retrieval system.\n* A chapter on tool-calling/MCP/Agents: Uses an example of writing tools to return data from a local database, MCP examples with Claude Desktop, and agent based designs with those tools with OpenAI, Anthropic (showing MCP fixing queries), and Google (showing more complicated directed flows using sequential/parallel agent patterns). This chapter I introduce LLM as a judge to evaluate different models.\n* A chapter with screenshots showing LLM coding tools -- GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Google's Antigravity. Copilot and Claude Code I show examples of adding docstrings and tests for a current repository. And in Claude Code show many of the current features -- MCP, Skills, Commands, Hooks, and how to run in headless mode. Google Antigravity I show building an example Flask app from scratch, and setting up the web-browser interaction and how it can use image models to create test data. I also talk pretty extensively\n* Final chapter is how to keep up in a fast paced changing environment.\n\nTo preview, the first 60+ pages [are available here](https://crimede-coder.com/blogposts/2026/LLMsForMortals). Can purchase worldwide in [paperback](https://crimede-coder.com/cdcstore/product/large-language-models-for-mortals/) or [epub](https://crimede-coder.com/cdcstore/product/large-language-models-for-mortals-a-practical-guide-for-analysts-with-python/). Folks can use the code LLMDEVS for 50% off of the epub price.\n\nI wrote this because the pace of change is so fast, and these are the skills I am looking for in devs to come work for me as AI engineers. It is not rocket science, but hopefully this entry level book is a one stop shop introduction for those looking to learn.",

Plain DS also has cloud.\n\nSo now i am in a dillema.\n\nwhether i should go with a course that will give me solid statistics foundation(as i dont have a stats bacground) but less DS related and AI stuff.\n\nOr i should take plain DS where the stats would still be at a very basic level, but they teach the modern stuff like ml,nlp, \"DL & genai\", cloud. I keep saying \"DL & GenAI\" because that is one subject in the plain msc.\n\n  \n**Goal**: I dont want to become a researcher, My current aim is to become a Data Scientist, and also get into AI\n\nIt would be really appreciated if someone can help me solve this dillema.\n\nSharing the curriculum\n\n[Msc Stats And DS pic 1](https://preview.redd.it/kyx5llb1uvlg1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd1b18f64c9faaf83ef2b52a0c60426c87e30deb)\n\n[Msc Stats And DS pic 2](https://preview.redd.it/20303b08uvlg1.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=3519e15b50956617c20196c84351db4936df9d9c)\n\n[Msc Data Science](https://preview.redd.it/o02j4jzbuvlg1.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=64c9dbb7ec012a4815caa74563498cfa78563c73)",

The stats coursework is not deep/ challenging, it adds in SQL which can easily be self taught, and then the deep learning genai courses are not that close to industry standards. \n\nOn the other hand a proper stats masters will put you in a competitive position (where you know more about something than them) to many MLEs and some data scientists. \n\nThe exception to this I would assume is if it truly is a top program where the lecturers actually have the industry experience to be teaching DL/ gen AI, and it is part of a larger series of courses.",

There are other angles so take this with a grain of salt.\n\nDS degree seems to focus on implementation rather than foundations. \n\nLlms are already pretty good at implementation, especially common patterns. And will likely continue to get better.\n\nMethods will change and be automated but statistics will always be the foundation. Gen ai class sounds cool but when the paradigm around how they are used changes, much of what you learned in that class may no longer be relevant. \n\nWhen you’re building a model, having an understanding of what’s going on under the hood will often be more useful especially when it comes to debugging, edge cases, concepts used in combination in a way they aren’t commonly.\n\nIf battery prices are magically cut in half tomorrow, electric cars will all of a sudden be a much more attractive option for a lot of people.

In some areas that may be okay, and I’m sure they could pick it up over time, but if you need someone who can immediately start providing value to a team, I find that stat majors in general need more time to do so.",

Definitely would recommend a masters of stats over a MS DS, especially if you have an undergrad DS degree. Two common problems I see:\n\n1) data science degrees vary considerably in quality. I think it's unfair to completely write off masters of DS degrees, so I spend a lot of time looking at curriculum of the degrees that candidates have. Some are rigorous and thorough, others are basically degree mills. Not all hiring managers do that though, a lot will just assume a DS MS is sub par quality \n\n2) your goal with a master's should be to develop specialization, become good at something that will be attractive to employers. You can't be good at everything. I look for candidates who are \"good enough\" across the board and are \"great\" in specific areas that will benefit my team. Optimization, computer vision, NLP, deep learning, recommendation systems, Bayesian modeling, etc. Lots of places to specialize, just depends on what you find most interesting. You have to be comfortable having very little expertise in some of these niche domains; it's okay because you should have deep experience in others. \n\nAll of that said, I typically recommend a masters of statistics or a masters of computer science depending on what you want to specialize in. Either one will address both of these problems and will make it easier to find a job when you graduate.",

I believe the programs should cover statistics well enough that you should at-least understand what a P value is and also cover hands on optimization. So id rather have a well rounded employee as ML blends with statistics a lot especially with applied causal inference. Data science is heavily interdisciplinary.\n\nThat said i worked with stats people and many “math” majors have abysmal coding skills. So people obsessing over linear algebra, statistics is just fixating on the bare minimum. You dont need to be an absolute genius in statistics you just need to be functional. Some math majors (the pure maths) from experience also have abysmal statistics & coding skills. Some are extremely late career and they dont remember the information as well. \n\nI guess what I am trying to say here is that a masters degree doesn’t really teach you the depth you need, so fixating on depth isnt going to be enough. As long as you have the interdisciplinary foundation like\n1) Good coding hygiene \n2) Understanding of statistics that makes you functional\n3) Understanding of optimization.\n\nIf the degree is having you do proofs run away.\n\nAgain personal opinion, applied work > theoretical people who yap and dont actually build production grade solutions.\n\nAgain 3 years industry & managing people. Worked with all types of interns from different degrees. Also degrees right now from my experience are probably not even an accurate indicator when everyone now cheats using AI. I had an interview with a compsci student + math and statistics that doesnt know what a variable is in python. I have seen masters students that dont understand what a probability is.\n\nMy experience isnt unique and I am sure there are a lot of managers who saw people who are great on paper but are absolutely terrible.\n\nAgain an absolute beast stats major most likely will be R only guy.

Each hiring season I'll see several contract roles at AirBnB posted at the same time with different recruiting firms. Job description is almost identical. After we get in touch, almost all will ghost me. About 2 will set up a call. Recruiter call goes well, they say theyll connect me to hiring manager and then disappear. The first couple times I followed up a few days later, then a week, another week, two weeks after that... Nothing. \n\nMeta and google are doing this a bit too, but AirBnB is just constant with this nonsense. I don't even click on their job postings or interact with recruiters for them anymore. Is this a scam? Are they having trouble with hiring freezes or posting ghost jobs? Can anyone shed some light on this or confirm having a similar experience?",

We aren’t just “running a test” there are rules based on the fundamentals of the Z and T distributions.\n\nAnytime you run a test you increase the probability of an error. If you run multiple tests and don’t make a bonferroni correction, then you are making a mistake. The correction is for multiple comparisons. Every time you run a test, it’s an additional comparison. Tests should be pre-determined, otherwise you dive into this world where you’re hunting for an outcome that fits your narrative. There are mathematical proofs behind all of this - it’s not up for debate. \n\nFor you, I would start with the fundamentals of the Z and T tests. The assumptions, when to use one vs the other, and when we can’t use either. Then I’d learn ANOVA. If you can handle multivariate calc, you should understand the derivation of these tests. \n\nAfter that, running the test is really easy.

For a standard A/B test with binary outcomes and a reasonable sample size, a two-proportions z-test and a confidence interval are usually enough to make the decision. A permutation test can be a nice robustness check, but the sign test especially feels unnecessary unless you clearly justify what additional question it’s answering.\n\nYou mention alpha, power, and a 2% practical significance threshold, which is good, but the important part is whether those numbers actually drive your conclusions. Was the sample size calculated based on that 2% lift? Is that lift absolute or relative? And in your write-up, does the business decision hinge on exceeding that threshold, or does it default back to p-values?\n\nThe bigger issue is narrative clarity. If someone has to read through multiple test results to understand whether the treatment should ship, the analysis is doing too much and saying too little. Strong A/B analysis is less about stacking methods and more about clearly linking effect size, uncertainty, and business impact. Right now it doesn't feel like a decision-making framework.",

I’ve done some practice calculating minimum required sample size, but it wasn’t necessary to include in this analysis.\n- 2% lift is absolute. Relative lift is around ~15%. The executive summary has a somewhat complex but informative gauge chart that shows how the data performed relative to what would be needed to pass the practical significance threshold.\n- from this, I actually have a question: why do we even do statistical tests if practical significance is the threshold for implementation? It seems that setting cohen’s d generally results in more stringent requirements. Why even test for statistical significance at all?\n- for narrative clarity, I would be curious what your thoughts would be after seeing the dashboard! If you haven’t already. I have an executive summary that details all four tests fairly clearly, four pages that go into each in depth, and then one page that delivers the final recommendation.\n\nAgain, thanks for your comment!

In **less than 10 minutes** of active engagement and only a few quick revision suggestions, I'm left with:\n\n* A shockingly faithful recreation of the NYTimes visualization, both static \\*and\\* interactive versions\n* An in-depth research memo describing the analytic process, its limitations, key learnings, and important interpretation caveats\n* A fully auditable and reproducible code pipeline for every step of the data processing and visualization work\n* And, most exciting to me: A modular, self-improving data documentation reference \"package\" (a Skill folder) that allows anyone else using DAAF to analyze this dataset as if they've been working with it for years\n\nThis is what DAAF's extensible architecture was built to do -- facilitate the rapid but rigorous ingestion, analysis, and interpretation of \\*any\\* data from \\*any\\* field when guided by a skilled researcher. This is the community flywheel I’m hoping to cultivate: the more people using DAAF to ingest and analyze public datasets, the more multi-faceted and expansive DAAF's analytic capabilities become. We've got over 130 unique installs of DAAF as of this morning -- join the ecosystem and help build this inclusive community for rigorous, AI-empowered research!\n\nIf you haven't heard of DAAF, learn more about my vision for DAAF, what makes DAAF different from other attempts to create LLM research assistants, what DAAF currently can and cannot do as of today, how you can get involved, and how you can get started with DAAF yourself at the GitHub page:\n\n[https://github.com/DAAF-Contribution-Community/daaf](https://github.com/DAAF-Contribution-Community/daaf)\n\n**Bonus**: The Election data Skill is now part of the core DAAF repository. Go use it and play around with it yourself!!!",
