Pretty low standards.\n\nBeing \"[employed](https://www.bls.gov/cps/definitions.htm#employed)\" also has a low standard -- having been paid for **1 hour** as an employee or as a self-employed person during the BLS's reference week, and it's become much easier to technically meet that threshold with gig work and freelancing. That's why the unemployment rate(s) are usually so low in the first place. And the BLS's metrics for underemployment don't include a wage/income variable; they're just tied to time worked.",

          "text": "There's an easy fix to this. Require any posted position to post up a bond that is a percentage of the mean total compensation (including stock award and fringe benefits) of the company.  It doesn't need to be disruptive or be a lot, just something that adds a cost to wasting people's time. You could make it 0.1% of that total comp. Or maybe that's not enough and it needs to be more. I have no idea the exact number, but a study can figure out at what point it's adding friction with no benefit and where it's got the most utility to discourage bad actors enough for them to stop. Continuing my analogy, basically make them post up the equivalent of what they'd pay for something like 2 hours of compensation of their average employee. They're going to occupy the attention and time of literally hundreds of hours of other people's unpaid time that will be applying for that job anyway, so as a fraction of the real cost this has on society it's peanuts.\n\nIf they fill the position, great, when they submit their new employee's first IRS withholding, they are allowed to submit that payment minus the bond they posted for the employee's position. The company gets their money back in full, effectively making it cost nothing in monetary terms to search for and hire the person.\n\nIf they don't fill the position, that sucks, but Dept of Labor keeps the bond. Company pays a financial cost, which makes them think next time about how they market the position and who they're targeting to apply for it, and hopefully they'll be better next time and not create a time-waster for otherwise qualified individuals that are being baited by a company that is using AI to post and repost the same position every day so that at any given time they'll have 50 qualified candidates that they can hire and onboard at a moment' notice. This kind of thing generates value for some companies by converting other people's wasted time into a way to quickly have a pool of candidates ready to go at any moment, instead of spending real resources into doing a search for a real position that will be filled. For companies that are generating, posting, and then taking the job postings down automatically with software tools that don't cost any of their own human time, they are wasting the human time and energy of people in society that aren't being compensated. The value of convenience they're getting for (essentially) free is paid for by wasting other people's time, so a forfeited job posting bond is the relatively tiny cost that is borne on them for having the right to waste this much human capital and human energy.\n\nThe money is only deducted from the first IRS withholding payment. This forces a compliance with actually hiring someone, since they're creating a transfer payment from the company to a taxpayer and therefore generating federal income taxes and payroll taxes.\n\nIf they want to keep paying the fee to have this convenience, that's fine, but every time it incurs a new fee. I don't care what fund the fee gets added to since it's a disincentive from participating in this anti-social manipulative and time-wasting behavior for people chasing an invisible carrot. But maybe you could use the money to fund career development services for the public.\n\nI'm sure you can figure out some loopholes in that basic concept, as I came up with this plan in 1 minute. But I'm confident you can run something like this without making it onerous on the company that is hiring and give them an economic incentive for only using applicants time when they are actually serious about hiring. Could possibly use median total comp instead of mean, but I chose mean because it captures the weight of the salaries of senior leadership to prevent a possible loophole where chief officers are payed 100 million a year compensation while the median employee makes $10 an hour where their entire shell company's job is farming applicants for positions that pay $150 an hour. We get rid of all loopholes like this to make companies pay a real tangible cost for wasting time and things would be much better for everyone.",

There are a lot of different things I've found being on this market\n\n1. Most places would rather hire a perfect candidate rather than hire at all. Meaning if you aren't perfect in jumping through whatever hoops they've laid in front of you they won't take a chance. You can't be 90 percent perfect, you have to jump through their specific hoops.\n2. Many places started moving only months after the jobs were posted. I think there is a lot of wait and see in the job market.\n3. I found that there was really large burst of activity at teh end of last year where people were trying to fill existing open positions. I am curently in final rounds with a few places and waiting to hear back from a few that are signaling offers. So for me this confirms a wait and see approach.\n4. I've found the places that are interviewing for real are two places. Its either places that had a recent turn over or if this is some new initiative team. I don't think there is a lot of actual posting where companies are expanding head count on 'existing' teams.  Most every interview that I had multiple stages with were places where there was a clear mandate i.e. new team that is going to be working on building out X or to resolve some existing major issues. I don't think any manager on established is growing their head counts.",

              "text": "No. Always sources of money where money congregates. Taxing people who do not have money just discourages it from happening when the time investment has zero chance of return on investment. In this relationship, the monied interest is the hiring company. If they make a legitimate post, they're investing money in filling the position because whatever salary they're willing to pay will be less than the return that employee will make for the company. It's in the company's interest to fill a position that needs to be filled.\n\nMeanwhile, the vast majority of applicants will not be considered, and even if they are there's no guarantee they'll be picked over the others. Their return on investment in terms of their time has a positive expected value obviously or no one would apply to jobs, but their likelihood of landing a job is close to zero. Also in the vast majority of cases, the applicant has far fewer financial resources than the hiring firm. And as stated before, hires only happen when the company makes money by reselling the product of the employee's work as a product or service to someone else, profiting off it. It's also much more likely that the applicant is not in a position to pay a filing fee that they'll lose in nearly 100% of their applications over months of applying, whereas most companies can find a hire within the first 2 or 3 postings for the same position even when the labor market is tight.\n\nThe financial interest of the company should be in line with the financial interest of the regulatory body that imposes a filing fee if you make the company liable for it when they're making unproductive postings (i.e., posts that waste peoples time for no reason). You want to either incentivize or not disincentive companies for behaving like good citizens. Ideally when the companies are not abusing job postings, they will pay no financial penalty or even possibly receive a financial incentive for closing the loop, hiring a worker and generating new tax revenue and a new salary for the employment rolls.\n\nThe point of the fee on the listing is not as a general revenue generator though, so it's important to reduce friction it would cause. Free is too cheap of a price to pay for wasting people's time for bad faith engagement. So make that cost more than zero, but make it small enough that a company won't go bankrupt if they genuinely have to do multiple job searches until the proper applicant comes along when they are operating in good faith. I describe (in a reply I made to this thread) how I would set it up in my conception of the financial disincentive for wasting applicants' time.",

The Hiring Manager had no idea.\n* AirBnB ghosted me twice for 2 different positions with 2 different teams.

Recruiter reached back out Monday of this week to schedule the next round.\n* Completed the entire process with Block. Recruiter was supposed to schedule a call with me and the Hiring Manager to discuss offer terms.

I had pretty bad vibes from the HM and a few others I interviewed with. I think my stats were:\n\n* 5 months total searching\n* 52 companies\n* 100% pass rate on technical screens\n* 100% pass rate on technical take home exams\n* I \"failed\" 5 HM screens, but quite frankly it would have never worked due to personality differences so that's fine.\n* A few ghostings randomly in the middle of rounds, so I will never know\n* 85% pass rate on presentations. I think the failures were my fault: I was either too verbose or too succinct for the given audience.\n* 14 offer rounds. 9 of those were \"we promoted someone from the inside\" or \"we had another candidate\". It was really upsetting to hear when it was due to another candidate and I have looked several of the companies up to see who they hired. In retrospect I am glad it didn't work out as they hired people who were more junior in experience, but prolific on spam posting on Medium and LinkedIn about their knowledge despite never having been in an actual role for longer than 2 years and never in a Senior or Staff role for more than 1.5. Their loss, not mine.\n* 5 quality offers. I passed on one due to insanely short relocation turnaround, another was too junior of a role and it did not align, and the other pass just a role that I honestly don't think I would have been happy in.

A lot of teams use case studies as a lazy filter and then fail at basic follow up. Saying no is reasonable, or at least setting boundaries like time boxing it or asking for a live walkthrough instead. The market is rough, but that does not mean you have to accept disrespect as the price of entry.",

Internships are great for exposure, but you already have a solid one plus projects. A junior role forces you to own problems end to end and that accelerates learning more than padding a CV. Grad schemes can be fine too, but they are often slower and more structured.\n\nIf a company has good seniors and a clear path for growth, that matters more than the title.

      "text": "Hello everyone, I am currently a data scientist with 4.5 yoe and work in aerospace/defense in the DC area. I am about to finish the Georgia tech OMSCS program and am going to start looking for new positions relatively soon. I would like to find something outside of defense. However, given how often I see domain and industry knowledge heralded as this all important thing in posts here, I am under the impression that switching to a different industry or domain in DS is quite difficult. This is likely especially true in my case as going from government/contracting to the private sector is likely harder than the other way around.\n\n\nAs far as technical skills, I feel pretty confident in the standard python DS stack (numpy/pandas/matplotlib) as well as some of the ML/DL libraries (XGBoost/PyTorch) as I use them at work regularly. I also use SQL and other certain other things that come up on job ads such as git, Linux, and Apache Airflow. The main technical gap I feel that I have is that I don’t use cloud at all for my job but I am currently studying for one of the AWS certification exams so that should hopefully help at least a little bit. There are a couple other things here and there I should probably brush up on such as Spark and Docker/kubernetes but I do have basic knowledge of those things.\n\nI would be grateful if anyone here had any tips on what I can do to improve my chances at positions in different industries. The only thing I could think of off the bat is to think of an industry or domain I am interested in and try to do a project related to that industry so I could put it on my resume. I would probably prefer something in banking/finance or economics but am open to other areas.",

It could also be a business domain like marketing or operations\n\n- Do one project (not more than one) that tackles a common problem in your target domain. Build a good GitHub repo for this project and use the readme section to explain this project in detail using the STAR format. Your hiring managers may not read your GitHub before the interview, but doing this will give you sufficient knowledge to explain this project in the interview when assessed for science depth\n\n- Decide whether you want to be DS or MLE/AS. If you want to be MLE/AS, do Leetcode and be comfortable with it. Also, practice ML design",

For data science and applied ML roles, arrays, hashing, and basic patterns cover a surprising amount of what actually comes up. Trees and graphs show up less often, but when they do, interviewers usually expect conceptual comfort rather than deep algorithmic tricks. I would prioritize being fluent at explaining your thinking and trade-offs over expanding into every topic. In practice, weak communication around simple problems hurts more than not knowing an obscure structure. If you do branch out, stacks and queues are usually the highest return before going much deeper.",

Focus on practicing common [Google data science interview questions](https://www.interviews.chat/questions/google-data-scientist) that cover A/B testing scenarios, metric design, and how you'd approach ambiguous business problems. Get comfortable explaining your thought process out loud since they care as much about how you think as what you know.\n\nThe good news is that Google's interview structure is fairly predictable, and there's tons of information available from others who've been through it. You should be drilling SQL queries daily, revisiting probability and statistics fundamentals, and doing mock interviews where you talk through case studies. The product sense rounds can feel intimidating, but they're really just testing if you can think like a data scientist who partners with product teams - how would you measure success for a feature, what metrics matter, what could go wrong. If you put in focused preparation over the next few weeks, you'll walk in ready. This is absolutely doable for someone at the senior level - just treat the prep like a sprint, not a marathon.",

I’m currently transitioning into Data Science and I’m eager to apply my analytical skills to both geological and broader business challenges.\n\nI'm looking for community insights on a few points:\n\n* **Model Focus:** Given my background in O&G, which models or techniques should I master first? (e.g., Time-Series, Spatial Data, or Predictive Maintenance?)\n* **Career Path:** Is it realistic to jump into freelance work, or should I secure a corporate role first to build a solid foundation?\n* **Community:** Any recommendations for groups or forums for STEM professionals pivoting to DS? \n\nLooking forward to your advice! :)",

      "text": "We’ve spent the last few months working on **PerpetualBooster**, an open-source gradient boosting algorithm designed to handle tabular data more efficiently than standard GBDT frameworks: [https://github.com/perpetual-ml/perpetual](https://github.com/perpetual-ml/perpetual)\n\nThe main focus was solving the retraining bottleneck. By optimizing for **continual learning**, we’ve reduced training complexity from the typical O(n\\^2) to O(n). In our current benchmarks, it’s outperforming AutoGluon on several standard tabular datasets: [https://github.com/perpetual-ml/perpetual?tab=readme-ov-file#perpetualbooster-vs-autogluon](https://github.com/perpetual-ml/perpetual?tab=readme-ov-file#perpetualbooster-vs-autogluon)\n\nWe recently launched a managed environment to make this easier to operationalize:\n\n* **Serverless Inference:** Endpoints that scale to zero (pay-per-execution).\n* **Integrated Monitoring:** Automated data and concept drift detection that can natively trigger continual learning tasks.\n* **Marimo Integration:** We use Marimo as the IDE for a more reproducible, reactive notebook experience compared to standard Jupyter.\n* **Data Ops:** Built-in quality checks and 14+ native connectors to external sources.\n\nWhat’s next:\n\nWe are currently working on expanding the platform to support LLM workloads. We’re in the process of adding NVIDIA Blackwell GPU support to the infrastructure for those needing high-compute training and inference for larger models.\n\nIf you’re working with tabular data and want to test the O(n) training or the serverless deployment, you can check it out here:[https://app.perpetual-ml.com/signup](https://app.perpetual-ml.com/signup)\n\nI'm happy to discuss the architecture of PerpetualBooster or the drift detection logic if anyone has questions.",
