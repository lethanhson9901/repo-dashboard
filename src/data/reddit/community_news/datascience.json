What seems to matter more is whether DS is tied to a real decision loop or just reporting. Teams where models inform or automate something concrete tend to have better incentives around data quality, infra, and career growth. In contrast, roles that sit downstream of the product with vague impact tend to get squeezed when budgets tighten. For 2026 specifically, I would look less at sector labels and more at signals like ownership of metrics, iteration speed, and whether DS is involved before decisions are made. Those usually tell you more than the brand name.",

You have three options\n\n1) accept that your notebook will no longer work, and eventually gets completely out of sync with the project to the point where it is unrecoverable.\n\n2) painstakingly refactor every notebook you wish to maintain every time you make a small to the codebase. It quickly becomes prohibitively long and annoying\n\n3) make all of your notebooks fully self-contained. Best solution, if the amount of local code required is not too big. Otherwise, some notebooks tend to grow so big you have to scroll for half an hour until you get to the actual line you want to run.\n\nCurrently, I believe that notebooks are strictly worse than anything one can do in basic python. Just have one switchboard file with a lot of imports, and comment some lines out as required before running, keeping all actual code in imported local function/class files\n\nA few more grievances: \n* Dynamic plots are completely unreliable. Yesterday I could do sliders with matplotlib with no issues, today you have to bend over backwards to get it to run on Jupyter. Yes, at the moment plotly works great, but what if that stops working too at some point in the future?\n* Files with large plots take ages to open, and can take a huge amount of space, preventing them from being checked into git. Yes, one can clear all content before checking it in, but that defeats the main selling point of a notebook, namely that one can just scroll though and understand what the notebook is about by looking at the plots. \n* Jupyter does not work with uv out of the box. One can run notebooks with local environments using VSCode, which is a godsend, but forces you into VSCode if you are normally using another ide.\n\nI would recommend newcomers bit to get too dependent on notebooks and use basic python instead",

From the beginning, the hiring manager seemed a bit disinterested and it felt like he was chatting with someone else during the interview. At one point I even saw him smiling while I was talking, and I was not saying anything remotely amusing.\n\nThat really threw me off and I got distracted, which led to me not answering some questions as well as I should have. The questions were about my past experience, things I definitely knew, and I think that ultimately contributed to my rejection.\n\nI was really looking forward to interviewing there, and in hindsight I feel like I could have done much better, especially if I had prepared a bit more.

Try to extract one or two concrete lessons, like better prep for storytelling or strategies to stay grounded when the vibe feels off, and then consciously let the rest go. Replaying every moment usually just makes it heavier than it deserves to be.\n\nAlso, a single interview does not define your ability or your trajectory.

I was an R expert (and still am, kinda) and although was not \"officially\" a statistician, I had a *very* deep background in mathematical modeling and frequentist stats. When I made the conscious decision to jump to \"industry\" instead of doing environmental work, I had the basics of SQL in my back pocket, thanks to having done a ton of data management at my boutique environmental firm.\n\n**What got me hired first was not the skillz but more how I approached a problem.** Bringing a different skill set to an organization is often times EXACTLY what a hiring manager wants, particularly if they get the signal that you're smart and can learn quickly. This is really all that matters: be smart and learn quickly and be able to show that you are or can do both. \n\nBe able to talk about models you know and how you could apply them. (For example, I applied nesting site fidelity models from sage grouse populations to predicting whether or new patients would return to a specific hospital. Same problem, different data and biz questions.) Be able to talk about how you apply stats. Be able to show how you write functions and think about how a model you've built locally could be handled by DevOps (or yourself) and moved into prod in \\[insert cloud provider of choice\\].\n\nAlthough Python is pretty much the currency of DS these days, there are still some R shops around and there are some good hiring managers left who are toolset agnostic, so long as the work is good and can be productionized. Python is easier to productionize and if you're already an R person, is pretty easy to pick up. Syntax differences can be funky, but aren't insurmountable.\n\nFeel free to reach out via DM with specific questions if you think I can help!",

I would push your manager for explicit time or scope around algorithm ownership, even small pieces, validation logic, prototypes, or improvements rather than just glue work. Career stagnation tends to happen when your role stops producing artifacts that look like design or code. Debugging builds intuition, but building things is what usually gets you labeled as an algorithm engineer.",

Deep support work teaches you how and why algorithms fail in the wild, which is valuable, but it can stall if you never get to change the design that caused the failure. Pure integration has the opposite risk, you ship a lot but rarely make core decisions.\n\nIn practice, the people I see move into stronger ML or algorithm roles are the ones who combine failure analysis with proposing and implementing fixes. I would push your manager for a hybrid scope where you debug edge cases and then actually redesign or prototype changes, not just tune knobs or write reports. Titles matter less than whether you can point to concrete algorithmic decisions you made and systems you improved because of real-world behavior.",

I live in the west so cost of living is not that high as in London. Is 70k a good salary for 5 YOE? I suspect I am still low for UK standards.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m currently working on a project using utility asset data (GIS / SAP / AMI) and I’m exploring whether this is a solid use case for introducing ML into a **customer-to-transformer matching audit** problem. The goal is to ensure that meters (each associated with a customer) are connected to the correct transformer.\n\n# Important context\n\n* Current customer → transformer associations are driven by a **location ID** containing circuit, address/road, and company (opco).\n* After an initial analysis, some associations appear wrong, but **ground truth is partial** and validation is expensive (field work).\n* The goal is **NOT** to auto-assign transformers.\n* The goal is to **prioritize which existing matches are most likely wrong**.\n\nI’m leaning toward framing this as a **probabilistic risk scoring** problem rather than a hard classification task, with something like **logistic regression** as a first model due to interpretability and governance needs.\n\n# Initial checks / predictors under consideration\n\n**1) Distance**\n\n* Binary distance thresholds (e.g., >550 ft)\n* Whether the assigned transformer is the **nearest** transformer\n* Distance ratio: distance to assigned vs. nearest transformer (e.g., nearest is 10 ft away but assigned is 500 ft away)\n\n**2) Voltage consistency**\n\n* Identifying customers with similar service voltage\n* Using voltage consistency as a signal to flag unlikely associations (challenging due to very high customer volume)\n\nModel output to be: \n\nP(current customer → transformer match is wrong)\n\n\n\nThis probability would be used to define operational tiers (auto-safe, monitor, desktop review, field validation).\n\n# Questions\n\n1. Does **logistic regression** make sense as a first model for this type of probabilistic audit problem?\n2. Any pitfalls when relying heavily on **distance + voltage** as primary predictors?\n3. When people move beyond logistic regression here, is it usually **tree-based models + calibration**?\n4. Any advice on **threshold / tier design** when labels are noisy and incomplete?",

Just watch out for geographic clustering effects messing with your distance assumptions (like rural vs urban transformer density)\n\n  \nFor thresholds with noisy labels, start conservative and let the field validation feedback tune your cutoffs over time rather than trying to optimize on incomplete ground truth upfront",

In practice people often move to tree models later for interactions, but good calibration and tiering around review capacity usually matter more than model complexity.",

For most associations, correctness is  uncertain unless there’s been field validation (which is very costly). The way I’m thinking about it is to only train on a subset of high-confidence labels: confirmed field corrections where available, plus some very strong inferred cases (like extreme distance ratios with a clearly closer viable transformer). Everything in the gray area would stay unlabeled and only be scored. The intent is to rank/prioritize review, not to auto-correct matches. The new field validation would feed back as additional high-confidence labels, so the model and thresholds can be tuned iteratively",

I have 5 years of experience in the insurance/reinsurance domain, working in catastrophe modeling, risk analytics, data cleaning, and geocoding using in house tools. My work has involved heavy data analysis, stakeholder interaction, and translating model outputs into business insights.\n\nI want to change domains and am evaluating two paths:\n\n1. MS abroad 2026 (Data Science / Analytics / related tech programs)\n2. MBA in India (to pivot into consulting / strategy / management roles)\n\nMy key questions: For someone at 5 years experience, which path offers a more realistic and sustainable domain switch? How do recruiters view prior domain experience in each case? Any regrets from people who chose MS vs MBA (or vice versa)? Are there risks of being “overqualified but underexperienced” in either path? My priority is long-term career satisfaction and growth, not just immediate compensation.\n\nThanks in advance...would really value insights from people who’ve faced a similar situation.",

Early on, it helps to focus on core stats, data wrangling, and being able to explain why a model should exist at all. Small end to end projects where you define the question, deal with messy data, and communicate trade-offs tend to be more valuable than stacking certificates. the transition is usually less about learning one more library and more about demonstrating how you think about data in context.",

I got my undergraduate degree in Computer Science in 2023 but could not find a job in the field due to small state university, lack of internships and just general job market. I returned to school to get my MS because I really enjoyed the intro data science courses I took in undergrad. I also hoped the market would reset by the time I graduated.\n\n  \nMy current master's program is an in-person program at a big university, and I have really learned a lot, but I can't seem to land an interview. I created a portfolio website from scratch using my web development skills from undergrad and put all of data science projects on there. Although some of them are somewhat small and there are only 6 or so on the website.\n\nIs there any advice out there other than just shotgun approach more applications? Any secret keywords when job searching or specific job search engines to use?\n\n  \nThanks for any advice anyone has got!",

So you are probably right that descriptively lots of data analysts don't do any causal inference at all, but I'd maintain that if a data analyst wants to improve their impact at their organization, taking a more complete approach to thinking about causal inference (what are the mechanisms driving the relationships they see) is the best way for them to increase their impact and unlock more career opportunities.\n\nIt doesn't need to even be super rigorous applications, but understanding why a diff-in-diff works the way it does is super helpful for unlocking bigger impacts as a data analyst.",
