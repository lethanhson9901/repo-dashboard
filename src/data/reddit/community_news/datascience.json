I was working with an HR rep, who didn't show up for our negotiation call and then I got an email saying my application had been withdrawn. The Hiring Manager had no idea.\n* AirBnB ghosted me twice for 2 different positions with 2 different teams. I had been told that I had passed the round and then the recruiter stopped replying.\n* I was ghosted by Pinterest in September. Same thing: passed the technical screen, never heard back. Recruiter reached back out Monday of this week to schedule the next round.\n* Completed the entire process with Block. Recruiter was supposed to schedule a call with me and the Hiring Manager to discuss offer terms. Never got a call, never got an email response.\n\nIt's hard to not blame myself in some of these cases, like the insurance example since I did counter-offer them, but ghosting is a shitty practice and becoming all too common. I highly doubt any company is using code from a case study for themselves if they actually have existing Data Scientists. What's really happening is that the market is flooded with good candidates and they don't give a fuck about burning a bridge with you because someone just as good or possibly better will come along.",

I have known a few former employees that all left due to rampant toxicity and poor WLB. I interviewed with them because my MO is to never turn anything down until the very end and see for myself. I had pretty bad vibes from the HM and a few others I interviewed with. I think my stats were:\n\n* 5 months total searching\n* 52 companies\n* 100% pass rate on technical screens\n* 100% pass rate on technical take home exams\n* I \"failed\" 5 HM screens, but quite frankly it would have never worked due to personality differences so that's fine.\n* A few ghostings randomly in the middle of rounds, so I will never know\n* 85% pass rate on presentations. I think the failures were my fault: I was either too verbose or too succinct for the given audience.\n* 14 offer rounds. 9 of those were \"we promoted someone from the inside\" or \"we had another candidate\". It was really upsetting to hear when it was due to another candidate and I have looked several of the companies up to see who they hired. In retrospect I am glad it didn't work out as they hired people who were more junior in experience, but prolific on spam posting on Medium and LinkedIn about their knowledge despite never having been in an actual role for longer than 2 years and never in a Senior or Staff role for more than 1.5. Their loss, not mine.\n* 5 quality offers. I passed on one due to insanely short relocation turnaround, another was too junior of a role and it did not align, and the other pass just a role that I honestly don't think I would have been happy in. The remaining 2 are the one I accepted and the one I mentioned above when I was ghosted.",

If it looks like unpaid consulting or has unclear evaluation criteria, that is usually a signal about how the team treats candidates and, often, employees.\n\nThe market does amplify this behavior, but it is also a reflection of weak hiring discipline.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\n  \nRecently had a common problem, where I had to improve the speed of my code 5x, to get to benchmark performance needed for production level code in my company.\n\nLong story short, OCR model scans a document and the goal is to identify which file from the folder with 100,000 files the scan is referring to.\n\n  \nI used a bag-of-words approach, where 100,000 files were encoded as a sparse matrix using scipy. To prepare the matrix, CountVectorizer from scikit-learn was used, so I ended up with a 100,000 x 60,000 sparse matrix. \n\nTo evaluate the number of shared words between the OCR results, and all files, there is a \"minimum\" method implemented, which performs element-wise minimum operation on matrices of the same shape. To use it, I had to convert the 1-dimensional vector encoding the word count in the new scan, to a huge matrix consisting of the same row 100,000 times.\n\nOne way to do it is to use the \"vstack\" from Scipy, but this turned out to be the bottleneck when I profiled the script. Got the feedback from the main engineer that it has to be below 100ms, and I was stuck at 250ms. \n\nLong story short, there is another way of creating a \"large\" sparse matrix with one row repeated, and that is to use the [kron](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.kron.html#scipy.sparse.kron) method (stands for \"Kronecker product\"). After implementing, inference time got cut to 80ms. \n\n  \nOf course, I left a lot of the details out because it would be too long, but the point is that a somewhat obscure fact from mathematics (I knew about the Kronecker product) got me the biggest performance boost.\n\nA.I. was pretty useful, but on its own wasn't enough to get me down below 100ms, had to do old style programming!!\n\n  \nAnyway, thanks for reading. I posted this because first I wanted to ask for help how to improve performance, but I saw that the rules don't allow for that. So instead, I'm writing about a neat solution that I found. ",

For example, if \"banana\" appears in the OCR 3 times, and in the original document 3 times, I thought the dot product would give 9.\n\nLooking at the documentation for \"CountVectorizer\", this is written for the \"binary\" parameter:  \n  \n\"**binary** bool, default=False\n\nIf True, all non zero counts are set to 1. This is useful for discrete probabilistic models that model binary events rather than integer counts.\"\n\nSo, I'm worried about the #1 case, but I'll explore in more detail",

I never accept suggestions with more than 2 lines, because 2 lines is my limit for what I can check quickly for accuracy. Once I developed the initial method, AI helped me get the inference time from 2 seconds to roughly 0.5s, but then it started going into circles, either suggesting things that don't work or stuff that doesn't impact the execution time.\n\n  \nSince I had to get down to 100ms, I decided to drop my initial approach, which was basically a \"for\" loop (comparing the generated text with each record from DB individually), and to try vectorization/matrix operations.\n\n  \nI knew about scikit-learn, so I was reading the documentation until I stumbled upon [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#countvectorizer), which can encode all DB records into a single sparse matrix. Key calculation was finding the number of shared words between the scanned document and each record in the database, which can easily be done with the [minimum](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.16.2/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.minimum.html) function. The only thing missing was how to quickly run this function, because it requires two matrices of the same shape, but the OCR results is only a 1-dimensional sparse matrix. In order to generate a large matrix, AI suggested [vstack](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.vstack.html), which worked and got me down to roughly 250ms, without impacting accuracy. I ran the cProfile profiler on my script, and noticed that the vstack took the most time to execute, so I needed to cut it down. I was thinking about how to construct a large matrix where 1 row is repeated a number of times, reading scipy.sparse docs, looking for another option, and was very happy to see that the Kronecker product was implemented: [LINK](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.16.2/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.kron.html).\n\n  \nOverall, AI was pretty good, and it might have done more with better prompting, but I needed a significant change in approach, and I felt like I was just going in circles with AI, so had to rely on my own neural network",

I am about to finish the Georgia tech OMSCS program and am going to start looking for new positions relatively soon. I would like to find something outside of defense. However, given how often I see domain and industry knowledge heralded as this all important thing in posts here, I am under the impression that switching to a different industry or domain in DS is quite difficult. This is likely especially true in my case as going from government/contracting to the private sector is likely harder than the other way around.\n\n\nAs far as technical skills, I feel pretty confident in the standard python DS stack (numpy/pandas/matplotlib) as well as some of the ML/DL libraries (XGBoost/PyTorch) as I use them at work regularly. I also use SQL and other certain other things that come up on job ads such as git, Linux, and Apache Airflow. The main technical gap I feel that I have is that I don’t use cloud at all for my job but I am currently studying for one of the AWS certification exams so that should hopefully help at least a little bit. There are a couple other things here and there I should probably brush up on such as Spark and Docker/kubernetes but I do have basic knowledge of those things.\n\nI would be grateful if anyone here had any tips on what I can do to improve my chances at positions in different industries. The only thing I could think of off the bat is to think of an industry or domain I am interested in and try to do a project related to that industry so I could put it on my resume. I would probably prefer something in banking/finance or economics but am open to other areas.",

It could also be a business domain like marketing or operations\n\n- Do one project (not more than one) that tackles a common problem in your target domain. Build a good GitHub repo for this project and use the readme section to explain this project in detail using the STAR format. Your hiring managers may not read your GitHub before the interview, but doing this will give you sufficient knowledge to explain this project in the interview when assessed for science depth\n\n- Decide whether you want to be DS or MLE/AS. If you want to be MLE/AS, do Leetcode and be comfortable with it. Also, practice ML design",

Focus on practicing common [Google data science interview questions](https://www.interviews.chat/questions/google-data-scientist) that cover A/B testing scenarios, metric design, and how you'd approach ambiguous business problems. Get comfortable explaining your thought process out loud since they care as much about how you think as what you know.\n\nThe good news is that Google's interview structure is fairly predictable, and there's tons of information available from others who've been through it. You should be drilling SQL queries daily, revisiting probability and statistics fundamentals, and doing mock interviews where you talk through case studies. The product sense rounds can feel intimidating, but they're really just testing if you can think like a data scientist who partners with product teams - how would you measure success for a feature, what metrics matter, what could go wrong.

Smaller companies or places where the MLE role is closer to a traditional SWE role might dig deeper into LLD. If you're already solid on DSA and ML system design, spending maybe 20-30% of your remaining prep time on basic OOP principles and common design patterns is reasonable insurance, but don't let it take priority over your core MLE prep.\n\nThe good news is that you don't need to go as deep as a backend engineer would - just understand the fundamentals like SOLID principles, a handful of common patterns (factory, strategy, observer), and how to write clean, maintainable code. Most interviewers care more about seeing that you can structure code reasonably than testing whether you've memorized every design pattern.

Tuning parameters under deadline pressure builds intuition, but it rarely lets you define assumptions or failure modes, Which is what carries over to ML work. On the C++ side, the risk is getting stuck in integration, so the key question is whether you can own parts of the algorithmic design and not just implement specs. I would ask your manager how often each path involves proposing changes versus executing predefined solutions, and who is accountable when performance degrades. the skill that transfers best to AI work is not a specific tool, but the habit of reasoning about trade-offs and system behavior end to end.",

I have 5 years of experience in the insurance/reinsurance domain, working in catastrophe modeling, risk analytics, data cleaning, and geocoding using in house tools. My work has involved heavy data analysis, stakeholder interaction, and translating model outputs into business insights.\n\nI want to change domains and am evaluating two paths:\n\n1. MS abroad 2026 (Data Science / Analytics / related tech programs)\n2. MBA in India (to pivot into consulting / strategy / management roles)\n\nMy key questions: For someone at 5 years experience, which path offers a more realistic and sustainable domain switch? How do recruiters view prior domain experience in each case? Any regrets from people who chose MS vs MBA (or vice versa)? Are there risks of being “overqualified but underexperienced” in either path? My priority is long-term career satisfaction and growth, not just immediate compensation.\n\nThanks in advance...would really value insights from people who’ve faced a similar situation.",

Copilot should only be interpreting the human aspect of what they're asking for, then activating whatever hardcoded search function you have for the appropriate documentation with the relevant information. I would only use it as a wrapper for a robust search function that looks pretty and makes it easy to interact with. Lots of people in the comments have good ideas on how to actually implement the search feature. But installing the AI wrapper will make you look like an AI god and make it dummy proof for leadership to interact with.",

Air-gapped hosting plus legal concerns means the vendor should be judged on deployment model, security posture, and how well they do citation-grounded retrieval over your PDFs. A good system should default to returning filenames, dates, and relevant passages with page references, and it should be comfortable saying no relevant documents found instead of guessing. Your example query is basically metadata filtering plus semantic search, so chunking, embeddings, and indexing quality will matter more than model size. People who've used products like Spellbook, AI Lawyer, CoCounsel often end up caring less about the model and more about the workflow: can you verify in one click and audit what happened. If you keep it retrieval-only and enforce always show sources, you're already avoiding the most common disaster mode.",
