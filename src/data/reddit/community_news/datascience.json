More than one of the models my team and I have built at Amazon have $100s of millions in annual impact, either via top line revenue, company spend, or loss avoidance.

I like to think of it like the ship repair problem.\n\nA ship's engine failed, halting production, and no mechanic could fix it. An expert tapped a specific spot with a hammer, instantly repairing it. The $10,000 bill was questioned, prompting the expert to itemize: $1 for tapping, $9,999 for knowing where to tap, highlighting that expertise, not just education and effort, holds immense value.",

If I were to take a stab at an early indicator for my specific success, as well as the success of many others in similar roles, it's a well-roundedness coupled with an ability to distill a business problem into a solution which non-technical/semi-technical product owners couldn't autonomously conceptualize and deploy. Applying this at the right time opened the right doors, which led to more opportunities as I progressed.\n\nMy background is in statistics and computer information systems, and when I was recruited to Amazon, it was for a business intelligence engineer position. My early success was based on understanding the technical difficulties which were blocking my predecessors from solving business problems, and simplifying/clarifying access to data and insights which the business needed. As an example, the group was in the midst of a migration, and had two live system sources which couldn't be reconciled (<2% delta which derailed many business reviews). I removed the legacy source, and when asked by the head of business if I had root caused the delta, I instead replied that I acknowledged that the delta didn't need to be resolved as the decisions they would be making would be the same. They stopped arguing about the data fidelity and focused on taking actions to grow the business. \n\nWhile this was a small issue which I solved in a relatively low-earning role, it earned trust with people who invested in my development and set me up for larger impact roles. This, in turn, put me in a position to apply similar skills to bigger and deeper scientific problems.",

The candidates that deeply impress me are far more likely to have FAANG or FAANG-adjacent experience.\n\nThere’s a depth and complete comfort with statistical theory, ability to tackle a new technical problem on the spot, analytical creativity, and product intuition that I’ve only observed in candidates from top tech companies. That’s not to say that I don’t get a lot of FAANG candidates that are terrible. Just last 1-2 weeks I interviewed a former Meta and Amazon DS that could barely pass a simple algorithms interview. But the only candidates that ever completely crush my theoretical stats or optimization interviews are FAANG or FAANG adjacent (AirBnB, Uber, Stitch Fix from 5 years ago, etc), particularly Netflix and Google.\n\nI don’t know what type of DS roles you had in mind, the picture could be different from more product analytics roles. But for roles with a high technical bar, that’s not my experience.\n\nAlso, I would say companies are like schools, the biggest difference isn’t at the average but the p80 or p90.",

At FAANG, the question/idea comes up Monday, there’s a team spun up Tuesday with 3 docs for alignment, then 1-2 people powering through deeper analyses than I saw elsewhere Wednesday, a pre-meeting with leads and a few $1B+ scoped org leaders Thursday (who’ve already asked twice that week when you’d be done), then VPs shift teams to focus the laser on your DS recs after an audience Friday, probably netting 5x the yearly salary for the group in the next quarter of execution, while the same cycle starts the next week. All while 2-5 mega projects are ongoing, and metrics reports and ad hoc analyses are being written at all times. TBH, the roles are vastly underpaid at $500k for the value they truly create by aiming the $10M/yr engineering team that drives 6-9x ROI year after year (literally, I calculated this as part of planning: 6x ROI on headcount was the bottom cutoff for “right sizing” the org last year, with mean Eng cost of $950k as the input).\n\nThat’s the lowest level DS. The rest crush more. No joke. It’s just not the same scale, and every DS is extraordinarily capable or we just get other ones.\n\nThere’s a lot of talk about hiring fresh PhDs by other companies in the comments here and tbh, the hard part is never technical (that’s the minimum cost of entry), it’s doing a job and making the company value and prioritizing work—that’s why companies pay big bucks.",

Most people simply do not have the mental stamina or curiosity.\n\nAnother stark contrast is the ability to see what is important vs. what is not. Many non-tech DS would focus on the completely wrong problem and choose to spend time on low-ROI endeavors. You can argue this can be overcome with experience but at least based on my experience, many DS folks at FAANG can distill things much more naturally - again, absolutely nothing related to particular pieces of knowledge of technical expertise. \n\nBTW, what I wrote above would apply to almost any field.

          "text": "I have a different take for this thread...  \n  \nOnce upon a time, I too thought the pinnacle of a tech career was working for a FAANG. I applied a few times, got the standard rejections, and assumed that meant I wasn’t “elite” enough. I was just a government data scientist... useful, sure, but hardly the \"glamorous world of Silicon Valley.\"\n\nOver time, though, that illusion cracked. The more I learned about what many of those high‑paid engineers actually do: optimizing ad funnels, tuning engagement loops, building systems that nudge people into buying, scrolling, or arguing... and so, the less appealing it looked. Important in its own way, maybe, but not exactly the kind of work that feeds the soul.\n\nMeanwhile, I was quietly building something else.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, I started teaching myself machine learning.  “Deep learning” was considered fringe and even considered a joke by some in the data science community, but they then gave rise to LLMs and so much more. I was fascinated and given I understood some of the math of how vector embeddings work and how the models turned language problems into geometry problems, it was interesting to me.\n\nAbout 11 years ago, I met an NVIDIA engineer at a conference. He walked me through how their GPUs were architected: simple compute units, discrete memory blocks, all designed for massive parallelism. Perfect for linear algebra. Perfect for neural nets. And then he explained CUDA, and how it let you tap into all that power from high‑level languages like Python without wrestling with the hardware directly. That conversation stuck with me.\n\nAround the same time, I held some Amazon and Microsoft stock. But when my agency began moving into cloud, ethics rules kicked in: I couldn’t work on cloud initiatives while holding stock in the companies providing the services. So I sold it. And I reinvested the proceeds into… NVIDIA.\n\nThat five‑figure investment grew into seven figures. I added positions in companies like ASML and Lam Research, \"picks-and-shovels\" stocks that made far more sense to me than chasing the hype of OpenAI etc. Today, my investments earn me more than my government salary, and more than I’d likely be making at a FAANG. I’m financially independent. If I wanted to retire tomorrow, I could.\n\nBut I haven’t. Not yet. I want to see my kid through grad school - he's now a second-generation data scientist, delving into policy, AI ethics and a bunch of other things that will be important in coming years.  Along with having done some grounded work in wrangling data in areas as diverse as astrophysics and healthcare. And I still care deeply about my agency’s mission: real public‑interest work, not algorithms designed to maximize outrage, sell crap people don't need, or keep people glued to a screen.\n\nSo now, when I think about FAANG?  \nI don’t feel envy. I don’t feel regret.  \nI just feel… free.\n\nI built a path that made more sense for me - technically, financially, and ethically. And I wouldn’t trade it for anything.",

Not sure, really. I'm maybe not among the handful of people that can take most of the credit for success, but still, I'm happy to have maneuvered myself in the right place, at the right time, and out of intellectual interest pursuing some good career decisions early on. PhD, publications (only a handful that I'm proud of), tenure at a research uni, research interest in somewhat relevant things (although everything turns over every few years), and most importantly willing to be quite flexible and to take some risks. Also, working reasonably well with others.   Jensen Huang keeps pointing out the value of [thinking over coding](https://www.storyboard18.com/brand-makers/nvidias-jensen-huang-wants-engineers-to-think-not-code-in-the-age-of-ai-87864.htm). Similarly, you can run yet another PCA, ANOVA, or fit a nice GLMER. Many others can, too. But putting the results in business perspective, thinking about what is the \"right\" thing to do as opposed to merely optimizing shareholder value in the short term, and understanding decision-making under uncertainty from a bigger perspective, separates people, I think.",

It means being able to work in teams and across functions to deliver product OTIF and also communicate what is going on to stakeholders and end users alike. There is a downside: because the role is more mission critical, the stress level is likely to be higher. But if you have the psychological equipment to deal with that, you will be fine.",

One theme across examples of models generating millions in revenue is they are all *predictive* algorithms: taking the output of a prediction and making decisions at scale with those results.\n\nBackwards variable selection has plenty of shortcomings as a *predictive* model selection method, but in the context of models generating revenue, the downsides are mainly opportunity costs of using that vs any other model specification where there might be diminishing returns to continuing to tinker.\n\nWhere criticisms of backwards variable selection really get loud is in its use for *inferential* modeling. That's where your p-values won't mean what you think they mean, your confidence intervals won't meet nominal coverage, and basically any kind of hypothesis testing or estimation isn't going to perform as intended. So, that is to say, if you were using backwards variable selection to do something like understand which customer attributes are most influential in predicting lifetime value and then storytell about those and design business strategies to do ~something~ with those attributes, you might have been pretty misled by this approach, both in which variables were selected and what those relative impacts were.",

This means the researcher begins with a belief that a specific relationship exists between a set of variables and an outcome of interest, and then uses a model to evaluate whether the data support that belief. For example, a researcher might hypothesize that a medication reduces the likelihood of a particular disease and fit a model to test this relationship. If the analysis shows no effect, the hypothesis is not supported. In this context, models are theory-driven and primarily used for inference, that is, understanding whether and how variables are related.\n\nIn industry, the primary goal is often different. Rather than focusing on causal relationships, practitioners are typically more concerned with maximizing predictive accuracy. From this perspective, a model created through backward elimination is data-driven rather than theory-driven: variables are retained or removed based on how well they improve prediction, not on whether they align with an existing theoretical framework. As a result, the final model may or may not be interpretable from a theoretical standpoint.",

This concern is directly relevant to my original post that differentiates academia vs industry.\n\n\nIn academia because your model is based on theory, and you put forward a hypothesis, you know the variables you will be testing ahead of time. This makes it possible to plan the study, sample size, and to even simulate results ahead of time. This does not make overfitting impossible but it makes it far less likely as you will know the hypothesis, and as a result, the model you will run a-priori to data collection, leaving you open to prepare the study accordingly.\n\n\nIn industry, it is exactly because models are often data-driven that overfitting is a bigger concern. You do not know what your model will look like before the data is collected, as, by definition techniques like backward elimination are data-driven. Because you cannot anticipate your model, you therefore are limited in your ability to prepare, and you run a greater risk of an overfit model coming up.\n\n\nNotice how in reconciling our posts to I did not need to imply that you obviously must know nothing and instead can skip that step in favor of discussing how the two different perspecrives we brought are both relevant. ",

I could certainly be wrong here, and an imperfect model that does its job well may still be very valuable.\n\nOn the otherhand, Harrel's work is all about causal inference in clinical trials and biostats. In that setting, you care much more about selecting covariates (features) that causally relevant for your design and not just those that are related at p < .05 to your outcome. See for example the literature on the dangers of controlling for post treatment variables.\n\nOn the otherhand, maybe you have a bunch of potential predictors for your model that you need to dwindle down to a manageable number in a data driven way. In that case, backward selection makes sense from an ease of use standpoint, although you could try LASSO or post double selection LASSO with the caveat that they dont always pick alot of variables. \n\nIn academia, I would never use backward selection unless there was a really specific and good reason for doing so. But most of my work doesnt involve prediction,  it involves more causal questions for which the acceptablity of that method for variable selection is low.\n\nAs an anecdote, in my policy masters I was taught all about forward and backward selection while it has not come up once in all the methods classes I took in my PhD.",

For those who haven't seen it, it's a gradient boosting machine (GBM) written in Rust that eliminates the need for hyperparameter optimization by using a generalization algorithm controlled by a single \"budget\" parameter.\n\nThis update focuses on performance, stability, and ecosystem integration.\n\nKey Technical Updates:\n- Performance: up to 2x faster training.\n- Ecosystem: Full R release, ONNX support, and native \"Save as XGBoost\" for interoperability.\n- Python Support: Added Python 3.14, dropped 3.9.\n- Data Handling: Zero-copy Polars support (no memory overhead).\n- API Stability: v1.0.0 is now the baseline, with guaranteed backward compatibility for all 1.x.x releases (compatible back to v0.10.0).\n\nBenchmarking against LightGBM + Optuna typically shows a 100x wall-time speedup to reach the same accuracy since it hits the result in a single run.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/perpetual-ml/perpetual\n\nWould love to hear any feedback or answer questions about the algorithm!\n",

In practice, hyperparameters often encode inductive bias for specific data regimes, so I am curious where this breaks down. The LightGBM plus Optuna comparison is compelling on wall time, but I would want to understand how sensitive the results are across very different feature distributions and dataset sizes. Interop via ONNX and XGBoost export is a smart move if the goal is real deployment rather than just benchmarks. the question for me is less about raw speed and more about whether the learned structure stays robust once this is dropped into messy production pipelines.",

It’s much more about judgment than execution:\n\n* Is this problem even worth solving?\n* Does it matter for the business or the system as a whole?\n* Is it worth spending our limited time and people on it instead of something else?\n* How do I get results *through* other people and through the organization, rather than by doing everything myself?\n\nI find that being “technically right” is often not the hard part anymore. The harder part is deciding *what* to be right about, and *where* to apply effort.\n\nFor those of you who’ve made a similar transition:\n\n* How did you train your sense of value judgment?\n* How do you decide what *not* to work on?\n* What helped you move from “doing good work yourself” to “creating leverage through others”?\n* Any mental models, habits, or mistakes-you-learned-from that were particularly helpful?\n\nWould love to hear how people here think about this shift.

A good week was not shipping something myself, but unblocking someone else, killing a low value project early, or reframing a vague request into something the team could actually execute. That felt uncomfortable at first because it is less visible and less concrete.\n\nMy sense of judgment got better by sitting closer to stakeholders and paying attention to second order effects. You start noticing which projects quietly create leverage and which ones just generate slides. Saying no became easier once I saw how much opportunity cost there really is. the hardest habit to break was jumping into do the work because I could do it faster. Letting others struggle a bit, while still supporting them, ended up creating way more value long term. It sounds like you are already asking the right questions, which is honestly most of the transition.",

          "text": "Lots of good wisdom in already in this thread but I'll add my two cents on how to get work done through other people rather than doing in yourself. I read once in a management book (I think it was \"the making of a manager\") that your job as a team lead is to 1) define a goal, 2) help your team understand if they are moving towards that goal, and 3) inspire them to care about that goal. In my experience, that second role - helping people understand if they're moving towards a goal - is the most important part but it's also easiest to overlook. It can be tough in data work to understand if you're making progress or if you're getting stuck in a rabbit hole. Your instincts on how to zig and zag through various small decisions are likely great, which is why you got promoted, and now your job is to imprint upon your intuitions and tastes on your team so that they can start to make those same micro-decisions. So its important to both checkin frequently to help make those decisions, as well as explain your reasoning (e.g. \"we want to display the data in this way because our stakeholders are particularly interested in understanding this dimension of the data\" versus \"use a bar chart because its cleaner\"). \n\n  \nRelatedly, the best tactical management advice I ever got was \"don't only taste the soup when it's done.\" The worst thing you can do as a team lead is assign a task that takes weeks and only review it when it's done. By contrast, great head chefs will check in along the way to see how their chefs are prepping the ingredients, they will take an early taste of the stock, give adjustments, etc. That can sometimes be hard for younger ICs since they might believe that they should only show you finished products or only checkin when they've made great progress. So you'll need to encourage checkins when they're stuck and help them feel comfortable being vulnerable when something is not going well.",

I also have some freedom to implement some of my ideas to improve or set new systems in the company and see it work eg. using m365 tools like sharepoint power automate power apps etc to create portals, apps and automation flows which collect data and I present that in meetings.

It sounds like you are getting value exposure to driving a business and you shouldn’t discount that just because it wasn’t a part of your original career plan. \n\nOne of my biggest mistakes in my career and holding on too tightly on my career paths. I always wanted to do public policy. I fought for years to remain in public policy even as it didn’t fit the direction life was taking me. Eventually I accepted that data science is what made the most sense for the experiences I was having, the opportunities that I was getting, and the constraints in my life. Once I became open to something other than my original plans, everything made sense and, funny enough, I found a way to contribute to public policy.\n\nSo my advice is to hold your career plans with an open hand. If you enjoy what you are doing now and are getting value experience, pour yourself into it. If data science is a deep and persistent passion, as your pour yourself into what you are doing now, you will naturally tackle it in a way that’s unique to someone with a passion in data science and your existing experiences will migrate closer to your career plans. But don’t let your career plans become a ball and chains that limit your ability to get experiences that you didn’t plan on getting or discover passion/talent that you didn’t plan on developing.",

A lot of teams jump straight to “generate code” and hit the validation wall you describe, because the review cost is real. The places where it seems to work better are narrow, well scoped tasks where correctness is easy to check, like draft documentation, test cases, or refactoring suggestions rather than greenfield logic. On the tooling side, flexibility usually comes from constraining the interface rather than the model. If the inputs and outputs are boring and well defined, the LLM can be sloppy internally without breaking anything. The harder question is whether the team is willing to invest in those interfaces, because that work often looks like overhead rather than leverage at first.",

They are good at turning rough notes into short docs and explaining code in simple words or if I put in a more simpler manner just helps you to get started..You want to build a DAG to orchestrate something, want to built agentic frameworks or just to make sense of the data, whatever it is LLM does helps with the cold start problem because context builds little by little\n\nFor the validation thing that you pointed it, I think its more the game of prompt engineering in that case…\nI have seen multiple cases where validation gets easier when you keep requests small concise and to the point. Ask for one function or one idea, not a full script. Short answers are easier to read and trust. A quick explanation with the code helps catch mistakes fast. As another redditor pointed out, decide on a particular template format you want the LLM input and output to be based upon and it will help you to streamline the use case workflows much better..Lastly, LLM’s efficiency is entirely depended on the context, the inputs you are provided, the sources you are asking it to refer to before it spurts out the responses, hence having a proper data source, data cleaning, document chunking, embeddings , RAG models, evaluation metrics..pondering over all of these goes a long way in unleashing these machine bots in an effective manner",
