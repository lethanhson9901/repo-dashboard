      "text": "Hey folks, this is an update from my previous post ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1qt2hhe/my_thoughts_on_my_recent_interview_experiences_in/)). You might also remember me for my previous posts about how to pass product analytics interviews in tech, and how to pass AB testing/Experimentation interviews. For context, I was laid off last year, took \\~7 months off, and started applying for jobs on Jan 1 this year. I've since completed final round interviews at 3 tech companies and am waiting on offers. The types of roles I applied for were product analytics roles, so the titles are like: Data Scientist, Analytics or Product Data Scientist or Data Scientist, Product Analytics. These are not ML or research roles. I was targeting senior/staff level roles.\n\n  \nI'm just going to talk about the final round interviews here since my previous post covered what the tech screens were like.\n\n  \n**MAANG company:**\n\n4 rounds:\n\n* 1 in depth SQL round. The questions were a bit more ambiguous. For example, instead of asking you to calculate Revenue per year and YoY percent change in revenue, they would ask something like \"How would you determine if the business is doing well?\" Or instead of asking you to calculate the % of customers that made a repeat purchase in the last 30 days, they would ask \"How would you decide if customers are coming back or not?\"\n* 1 round focused more on stats and probability. This was a product case interview (e.g. This metric is going down, why do you think that is?)  with stats sprinkled in. If you asked them the right questions, they would give you some more data and information and ask you to calculate the probability of something happening\n* 1 round focused purely on product case study. E.g. We are thinking of launching this new feature, how would you figure out if it's a good idea? Or we launched this new product, how would you measure it's success?\n   * I didn't have to go super deep into technical measurement details. It was more about defining what success means and coming up with metrics to measure success\n* 1 round focused on behavioral. I was asked examples of projects where I influenced cross-functionally and about how I use AI.\n\nAll rounds were conducted by data scientists. I ended up getting an offer here but I just found out, so I don't have any hard numbers yet.\n\n  \n**Public SaaS company** (not MAANG):\n\n4 rounds:\n\n* 1 round where they gave me some charts and asked me to tell them any insights I saw. Then they gave me some data and I was asked to use that data to dig into why the original chart they showed me had some dips and spikes. I ended up creating some visualizations, cohorted by different segmentations (e.g. customer type, plan type, etc.)\n* 1 round where they asked me about a project that I drove end-to-end, and they asked me a bunch of questions about that one project. They also asked me to reflect on how I could have improved it or done better if I could do it again\n* 1 round focused on product case study. It was basically \"we are thinking of launching this new product, how would you measure success?\". This one got deeper into experimentation and causal inference\n* 1 round focused on behavioral. This one was surprising because they didn't ask me any \"tell me about a time\" questions. I was asked to walk through my resume, starting from the first job that I had listed on there. They did ask me why I was interested in the company and what I was looking for next. It seemed like they were mostly assessing whether I'd be a good fit from a behavioral standpoint, and whether I would be at risk of leaving soon after joining. This was the only interview conducted by someone other than a data scientist.\n\nHaven't heard back from this place yet.\n\n  \n**Private FinTech company:**\n\n4 rounds\n\n* 1 round focused on stats. It was a product case study about \"hey this metric is going down, how would you approach this\", but as the interview went on, they would reveal more information. I was shown output from linear and logistic regression and asked to interpret it, explain the caveats, how I would explain the results to non-technical stakeholders, and how I would improve the regression analyses. To be honest, since I hadn't worked for several months, I am a bit rusty on logistic regression so I didn't remember how to interpret log odds. I was also shown some charts and asked to extract any insights, as well as how would I improve the chart visually. I was also briefly asked about causal inference techniques. This interview took a lot of time because there were so many questions that they asked. They went super deep into the case study, usually my other case study interviews were at a more superficial level.\n* 1 round with a cross-functional partner. It was part case study (we are thinking of investing in building this new feature, how would you determine if it's worth the investment), part asking about my background.\n* 1 round with a hiring manager. I was asked about my resume, how I like to work, and a brief case study\n* 1 round with a cross-functional partner. This was more behavioral, typical \"tell me about a time\" question. \n\nHaven't heard back from this place yet.\n\n  \n**Overall thoughts**\n\nThe MAANG interview was the easiest, I think because there are just so many resources and anecdotes online that I knew pretty much what to expect. The other two companies had far fewer resources online so I didn't know what to expect. I also think general product case study questions are very \"crackable\". I am going to make another post on how I prepared for case study interview questions and provide a framework for the 5 most common types of case study questions. It's literally just a formula that you can follow. Companies are starting to ask about AI usage, which I was not prepared for. But after I was asked about AI usage once, I prepared a story and was much better prepared the next time I was asked about how I use AI. The hardest interview for me was definitely the interview where they went deep into linear/logistic regression and causal inference (fixed effects, instrumental variables), primarily because I've been out of work for so long and hadn't looked at any regression output in months. \n\n\n\nAnyways, just thought I'd share my experiences for those who having upcoming interviews in tech for product analytics roles in case it's helpful. If there's interest, I'll make another post with all the offers I get and the numbers (hopefully I get more than one). What I can say is that comp is down across the board. The recruiters shared rough ranges (see my previous post for the ranges), and they are less than what I made 2-3 years ago, despite targeting one level up from where I was before. \n\nWhenever I make these posts, I usually get a lot of questions about how I get interviews....I am sorry, but I really don't have much advice for how to get interviews. I am lucky enough to already have had a big name tech company on my resume, which I'm sure is how I get call backs from recruiters. Of the 3 final rounds that I had, 2 were from a recruiter reaching out on Linkedin and 1 was from a referral. I did have initial recruiter screens and tech screens from my cold applications, but I didn't end up getting final rounds from those. Good luck to everyone looking for jobs and I hope this helps. ",

I think they're looking for signals that you can think in a structured way.\n\nFor example, you might be asked \"Churn has increased in the last 2 months. What do you do?\" This is not yet a causal inference problem. First step would be to rule out seasonality and instrumentation/logging changes. Second step would be to clarify whether this is customer/lgo churn, revenue churn, or both. Third step would be to decompose the metric: Did we have the same number of customers acquired and now they're churning at a higher rate? Or did the # of customers we acquired increase, and perhaps we are acquiring customer with lower intent so they churn more quickly? Fourth step would be to do some segmentation such as: New users vs. existing, power users vs. casual, segment by geography, platform, etc. This can give you clues into where the churn is coming from.\n\n  \nFor the companies that I interviewed at, it would not be a good answer to say that you'd run a logistic regression to predict churn and throw a bunch of variables in there and see which variables have the largest coefficients and lowest p-values. This is not structured thinking.",

The final round rejection stings the most because you invested the most time and emotional energy but it often comes down to factors completely outside your control like internal candidates, team chemistry, budget freezes, or another candidate having slightly more domain-specific experience. The biggest takeaway from these experiences should be what questions caught you off guard and what areas you felt least confident in because those are your highest leverage areas for improvement. Keep going because making it to final rounds consistently means an offer is just a matter of time.",

A few meta-observations:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On the interviews themselves:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nYour observation about MAANG being the \"easiest\" tracks an important trend: they've systematized their interview process SO much that it's almost plug-and-play. Fewer curve balls = higher predictability = more competition.\n\n\n\nThe public SaaS and FinTech companies? They're still figuring it out. That's actually a good sign they're growing fast. Bad sign for candidates preparing, though.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The real insight here:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\"Product case > behavioral > stats\" is becoming a universal trend. Companies realized pure stats/coding tests don't predict job performance as well as \"can you think like someone who actually works here?\"\n\n\n\nYour stats regression interview feedback was brutal but honest. That's the kind of company that will actually train you well because they know what gaps exist.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On the salary comment:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nYou're right that comp is down YoY. But here's what nobody mentions: the \\*quality of roles\\* changed. Senior/Staff level roles are thinner. Companies are hiring more mid-level roles. That's why the numbers look worse.\n\n\n\nTwo-year delta: if you get Senior title at 2026 rates, you're actually in a BETTER position than someone who got Senior title at 2022 rates (lower bar to clear).\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One thing you might add to your next post:\\*\\*\n\nWhich of these interviews felt like they'd genuinely let you grow? That's often MORE important than comp, especially if you're 0-3 YOE.\n\n\n\nGreat effort documenting this. Honestly, your detailed interview breakdown is more valuable than most \"blind\" posts.",

Definitely validated some of my struggles (mostly as a self-learner, LOL) like getting caught up with the Leetcode mindset with SQL and focusing too much on getting the query right, so I panic when it comes to follow-ups. Same with product questions, I’ve previously gotten tips on which frameworks/structure to use, but I’ll also try to apply your advice here.\n\nI think what’s been helping me lately get out of that more ‘technical’ mindset is practicing more realistic prompts instead. I still do SQL drills on LC and StrataScratch since they have lots of practice questions, but I also look for product prompts/case studies on sites like Interview Query since they’re more detailed and have breakdowns. Still no offer yet on my end, but posts like this really encourage me and remind me I know enough, just need to keep practicing to improve how I think and communicate.",

If so, what did you plan on doing if a job in another state gave you an offer? \n\nAt least from my end, and I live in a major city, there's no way I can apply for 1200 data scientist positions in any reasonable amount of time. There just aren't that many that are anywhere near a decent fit for me. This includes local and remote. \n\nI finished up a job search late last year for senior data scientist position. While the search ended relatively quickly (about 20 applications) I could definitely see a scenario where I can apply to 100 or even 200 positions if I was \"flexible\" with regard to the role matching my skills, but I don't think there's any way I can find 1200 positions unless I was willing to move.\n\nAlso, did you require some kind of sponsorship?

Now was looking for MSC options.\n\nI came across a good college and they have 2 course for MSc:\n\n1: MSc Statistics and Data Science\n\n2: Msc Data Science\n\nI went thorugh the coursework. Stats and DS is very Stats heavy course, and they have Deep learning as an elective in 3rd Sem. Where as for the DS course the ML,NLP, and \"DL & GEN ai\" are core subjects. Plain DS also has cloud.\n\nSo now i am in a dillema.\n\nwhether i should go with a course that will give me solid statistics foundation(as i dont have a stats bacground) but less DS related and AI stuff.\n\nOr i should take plain DS where the stats would still be at a very basic level, but they teach the modern stuff like ml,nlp, \"DL & genai\", cloud. I keep saying \"DL & GenAI\" because that is one subject in the plain msc.\n\n  \n**Goal**: I dont want to become a researcher, My current aim is to become a Data Scientist, and also get into AI\n\nIt would be really appreciated if someone can help me solve this dillema.\n\nSharing the curriculum\n\n[Msc Stats And DS pic 1](https://preview.redd.it/kyx5llb1uvlg1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd1b18f64c9faaf83ef2b52a0c60426c87e30deb)\n\n[Msc Stats And DS pic 2](https://preview.redd.it/20303b08uvlg1.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=3519e15b50956617c20196c84351db4936df9d9c)\n\n[Msc Data Science](https://preview.redd.it/o02j4jzbuvlg1.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=64c9dbb7ec012a4815caa74563498cfa78563c73)",

I have had hiring managers tell me this in interviews. \n\nI think this is because most data science masters present a dumbed down mediocre soup of courses. The stats coursework is not deep/ challenging, it adds in SQL which can easily be self taught, and then the deep learning genai courses are not that close to industry standards. \n\nOn the other hand a proper stats masters will put you in a competitive position (where you know more about something than them) to many MLEs and some data scientists. \n\nThe exception to this I would assume is if it truly is a top program where the lecturers actually have the industry experience to be teaching DL/ gen AI, and it is part of a larger series of courses.",

Gen ai class sounds cool but when the paradigm around how they are used changes, much of what you learned in that class may no longer be relevant. \n\nWhen you’re building a model, having an understanding of what’s going on under the hood will often be more useful especially when it comes to debugging, edge cases, concepts used in combination in a way they aren’t commonly.\n\nIf battery prices are magically cut in half tomorrow, electric cars will all of a sudden be a much more attractive option for a lot of people.

I’ve seen that the biggest barrier to stats degrees trying to get a job on my team and the main DS part of our organization is that they aren’t able to write good code in general, use distributed systems, often don’t understand the general workflow pipeline for developing and choosing models, and tend to lack depth with the various areas of DS outside of stats. In some areas that may be okay, and I’m sure they could pick it up over time, but if you need someone who can immediately start providing value to a team, I find that stat majors in general need more time to do so.",

          "text": "I manage a data science org at a fortune 500 company. I do a lot of hiring. Definitely would recommend a masters of stats over a MS DS, especially if you have an undergrad DS degree. Two common problems I see:\n\n1) data science degrees vary considerably in quality. I think it's unfair to completely write off masters of DS degrees, so I spend a lot of time looking at curriculum of the degrees that candidates have. Some are rigorous and thorough, others are basically degree mills. Not all hiring managers do that though, a lot will just assume a DS MS is sub par quality \n\n2) your goal with a master's should be to develop specialization, become good at something that will be attractive to employers. You can't be good at everything. I look for candidates who are \"good enough\" across the board and are \"great\" in specific areas that will benefit my team. Optimization, computer vision, NLP, deep learning, recommendation systems, Bayesian modeling, etc. Lots of places to specialize, just depends on what you find most interesting. You have to be comfortable having very little expertise in some of these niche domains; it's okay because you should have deep experience in others. \n\nAll of that said, I typically recommend a masters of statistics or a masters of computer science depending on what you want to specialize in. Either one will address both of these problems and will make it easier to find a job when you graduate.",

I believe the programs should cover statistics well enough that you should at-least understand what a P value is and also cover hands on optimization. So id rather have a well rounded employee as ML blends with statistics a lot especially with applied causal inference. Data science is heavily interdisciplinary.\n\nThat said i worked with stats people and many “math” majors have abysmal coding skills. So people obsessing over linear algebra, statistics is just fixating on the bare minimum. You dont need to be an absolute genius in statistics you just need to be functional. Some math majors (the pure maths) from experience also have abysmal statistics & coding skills. Some are extremely late career and they dont remember the information as well. \n\nI guess what I am trying to say here is that a masters degree doesn’t really teach you the depth you need, so fixating on depth isnt going to be enough. As long as you have the interdisciplinary foundation like\n1) Good coding hygiene \n2) Understanding of statistics that makes you functional\n3) Understanding of optimization.\n\nIf the degree is having you do proofs run away.\n\nAgain personal opinion, applied work > theoretical people who yap and dont actually build production grade solutions.\n\nAgain 3 years industry & managing people. Worked with all types of interns from different degrees. Also degrees right now from my experience are probably not even an accurate indicator when everyone now cheats using AI. I had an interview with a compsci student + math and statistics that doesnt know what a variable is in python. I have seen masters students that dont understand what a probability is.\n\nMy experience isnt unique and I am sure there are a lot of managers who saw people who are great on paper but are absolutely terrible.\n\nAgain an absolute beast stats major most likely will be R only guy. However most production grade stuff have python. I think you need to be flexible and not a 1 trick pony.",

          "text": "Learn how performance reviews work at your company. Not just the regular 1-1 review meetings you have with your manager, but how often management comes together to discuss employees, and how they calibrate across people and teams. This matters a great deal for bonuses and awards, as well as how sought after you will be for internal advancement opportunities beyond your current immediate team. In previous organizations I've been at, performance calibrations sometimes were \"loudest voice led\" (managers who pushed hardest for their people would end up with them on top), and sometimes was \"popularity contest\" (employees who had good relationships with many managers or happened to do highly visible work were rewarded, employees whose work wasn't as visible and were unknowns to other managers not distinguished).\n\nKeep a running list of work accomplishments, and discuss them regularly with your manager. It will help you with those performance review and bonus processes as well as to keep your resume updated. \n\nGather as many advocates in your corner as possible beyond your own manager. If your manager is not very engaged, having others (especially department leaders and senior execs) who think highly of your work is critical for internal mobility and reducing the risk you'll be hit in a layoff.\n\nBeyond your accomplishments, time management, communication skills, and personality matter a lot for how you will be perceived. Learn what \"done\" actually means for your work and make sure you account for time for review and feedback, fixing issues, and handling unanticipated follow-ups. If you are working on something other people have dependencies on, make sure you are communicating status and why you might be delayed so you don't piss a lot of people off. Do not put yourself in a position where people can point to you as a scapegoat. Don't use technical jargon or get too in the weeds in front of an audience who doesn't care and will tune out. Use the same terminology as your business partners do. Aim for simplicity and brevity in your visualizations, presentations, emails, and reports, but don't be condescending, treat colleagues like dumb-dumbs, or mansplain. For meetings, show that you are respecting people's time and not tuning out, such as by being active in the chat with support and questions or keeping your camera on so that the meeting runners aren't seeing a bunch of lifeless muted black squares.",

However, for data scientists in particular, our personality and our ability to interact well with others, especially non-technical folks, is critical. \n\nFor some people this will sound pointless for others this will sound obvious, but it's really important that people actually enjoy working with you and being around you if you want to progress in your career.  You could be a technical master, but nobody wants to be around an asshole.  More importantly, they will only tolerate you for as long as they need to tolerate you and will drop you at the first opportunity if you have a poor personality. \n\nI saw this first hand in my first data science position. There was a senior guy who was extraordinarily technically competent, but he was a complete prick to EVERYONE except his boss. This guy had such a reputation as being a jerk that even Brown technical folks on the business side I thought he was a jerk, and they shouldn't have had that much contact with him. The problem was once his boss left people started maneuvering to get him canned too. \n\nIn contrast, if you got a good personality and maintain a positive attitude people will enjoy working with you and will look to you to help solve their problem, because they like you and trust you. This is especially true for the non-technical business folks when they interact with us. I've been called into meetings over seniors because the business leads knew me entrusted me and didn't know them.  This also leads to my second point. \n\nSometimes visibility is a literal thing. \n\nI love remote work, but I also got to see first hand at my last job how if there are two data scientists and one's remote and the other isn't the non remote data scientist is going to have a lot more opportunities to make a positive impression on leadership and business partners.  My previous team was remote but I was able to go into the office since I lived in the same city. Even though the other data scientists on the team work just as hard as me or harder she had nowhere near the visibility. \n\nThe results showed up in our performance reviews, particularly when leveling occurred where Managers from different parts of the business get together to standardize scores amongst employees.  She would tell me about how one of our directors seems to not like her and I would be perplexed because that director loved me. The problem was she was just a voice on teams and I was a face in the office. \n\nIf I was looking for career progression my ideal setup would be one to two days in the office where I could work closely with the non-technical business folks.  You really don't need more than that in the office to make an impression, certainly not 5 days. Folks just need to be able to SEE YOU as someone that they can work with and rely on.",

Server Orchestration/Automation (if used)\n1. IDE or text editor\n1. Version/Source control\n1. Notebook tools  \n  \n\n## How do you use it?\n1. What are your primary use cases (e.g. analytics, MLE/MLOps, app development, contributing to repos, intelligence gathering)?\n1. How does your setup help with other tech you have to support? (database system, sysadmin, dashboarding tools /renderers, other programming/scripting languages, web or agentic frameworks, specific cloud platforms or APIs you need...)\n1. How do you manage dependencies?\n1. Do you use containers in place of environments?\n1. Do you do personal projects in a cloud/distributed environment?  \n  \nMy version of python got a little too stale and the conda solver froze to where I couldn't update/replace the solver, python, or the broken packages. This happened while I was doing a takehome project for an interview:,)  \nSo I have to uninstall anaconda and python anyway.  \n  \nI worked at a FAANG company for 5 years, so I'm used to production environment best practices, but a lot of what I used was in-house, heavily customized, or simply overkill for personal projects. I've deployed models in production, but my use cases have mostly been predictive analytics and business tooling.  \n  \nI have ADHD so I don't like having to worry about subscriptions, tokens, and server credits when I am just doing things to learn or experiment. But I'm hoping there are best practices I can implement with the right (FOSS) tools to keep my skills sharp for industry standard production environments.

I don't use notebooks\n\nHow do I use it?\n\n1. I spend most of my time writing ML pipelines that feed our (SAAS) product. Scheduled tasks for training data ETL, training, monitoring and sometimes inference. Other times if it's something where we need inference in response to user action, either a lambda or a dedicated server depending on the usage patterns.\n2. I have kind of a love-hate relationship with vscode. Some of my projects are a mix of python and rust (PyO3), so it's nice having language support for both in the same editor, and the sqltools extension is great. The python debugger is pretty good. But the language servers randomly shit themselves like twice a week. And I wish copilot autocomplete was hooked into intellisense so that it would suggest functions and parameters that actually exist instead of just guessing.\n3. uv and pyproject.toml. almost all my stuff is containerized so it's pretty straightforward.\n4. In production yeah, but locally I always work in virtual environments. I always have at least one dependency group that's not used in production with ruff/pytest/pyright/stub packages.\n5. I don't really do personal projects. I'm lucky enough to be in an industry where my actual work is what my personal projects would be if I had a different job.\n\nIf you've been dealing with conda headaches and are looking for a new setup I *highly* recommend checking out uv. \n\n",

Do you use containers instead?\nI use UV virtual environments if the dependencies are simply specific versions of python packages. This is enough 95% of the time. For the rest, I use docker ontainers if it is anything newer. If my colleagues use conda environments, I might  either use conda/mamba if we collaborate on the project, else I will use pixi if it is just myself looking at it.\n\nDo you do personal projects in a cloud/distributed environment?\nIf it is work related I use SLURM.

      "text": "Shameless promotion -- I have recently released a book, [Large Language Models for Mortals: A Practical Guide for Analysts](https://crimede-coder.com/blogposts/2026/LLMsForMortals).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7t71ql8ek9jg1.png?width=3980&format=png&auto=webp&s=1870a49ec6030cad49c364062c02cf5da166993f\n\nThe book is focused on using foundation model APIs, with examples from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and AWS in each chapter. The book is compiled via Quarto, so all the code examples are up to date with the latest API changes. The book includes:\n\n* Basics of LLMs (via creating a small predict the next word model), and some examples of calling local LLM models from huggingface (classification, embeddings, NER)\n* An entry chapter on understanding the inputs/outputs of the API. This includes discussing temperature, reasoning/thinking, multi-modal inputs, caching, web search, multi-turn conversations, and estimating costs\n* A chapter on structured outputs. This includes k-shot prompting, parsing JSON vs using pydantic, batch processing examples for all model providers, YAML/XML examples, evaluating accuracy for different prompts/models, and using log-probs to get a probability estimate for a classification\n* A chapter on RAG systems: Discusses semantic search vs keyword via plenty of examples. It also has actual vector database deployment patterns, with examples of in-memory FAISS, on-disk ChromaDB, OpenAI vector store, S3 Vectors, or using DB processing directly with BigQuery. It also has examples of chunking and summarizing PDF documents (OCR, chunking strategies). And discusses precision/recall in measuring a RAG retrieval system.\n* A chapter on tool-calling/MCP/Agents: Uses an example of writing tools to return data from a local database, MCP examples with Claude Desktop, and agent based designs with those tools with OpenAI, Anthropic (showing MCP fixing queries), and Google (showing more complicated directed flows using sequential/parallel agent patterns). This chapter I introduce LLM as a judge to evaluate different models.\n* A chapter with screenshots showing LLM coding tools -- GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Google's Antigravity. Copilot and Claude Code I show examples of adding docstrings and tests for a current repository. And in Claude Code show many of the current features -- MCP, Skills, Commands, Hooks, and how to run in headless mode. Google Antigravity I show building an example Flask app from scratch, and setting up the web-browser interaction and how it can use image models to create test data. I also talk pretty extensively\n* Final chapter is how to keep up in a fast paced changing environment.\n\nTo preview, the first 60+ pages [are available here](https://crimede-coder.com/blogposts/2026/LLMsForMortals). Can purchase worldwide in [paperback](https://crimede-coder.com/cdcstore/product/large-language-models-for-mortals/) or [epub](https://crimede-coder.com/cdcstore/product/large-language-models-for-mortals-a-practical-guide-for-analysts-with-python/). Folks can use the code LLMDEVS for 50% off of the epub price.\n\nI wrote this because the pace of change is so fast, and these are the skills I am looking for in devs to come work for me as AI engineers. It is not rocket science, but hopefully this entry level book is a one stop shop introduction for those looking to learn.",

Each hiring season I'll see several contract roles at AirBnB posted at the same time with different recruiting firms. Job description is almost identical. After we get in touch, almost all will ghost me. About 2 will set up a call. Recruiter call goes well, they say theyll connect me to hiring manager and then disappear. The first couple times I followed up a few days later, then a week, another week, two weeks after that... Nothing. \n\nMeta and google are doing this a bit too, but AirBnB is just constant with this nonsense. I don't even click on their job postings or interact with recruiters for them anymore. Is this a scam? Are they having trouble with hiring freezes or posting ghost jobs? Can anyone shed some light on this or confirm having a similar experience?",

In **less than 10 minutes** of active engagement and only a few quick revision suggestions, I'm left with:\n\n* A shockingly faithful recreation of the NYTimes visualization, both static \\*and\\* interactive versions\n* An in-depth research memo describing the analytic process, its limitations, key learnings, and important interpretation caveats\n* A fully auditable and reproducible code pipeline for every step of the data processing and visualization work\n* And, most exciting to me: A modular, self-improving data documentation reference \"package\" (a Skill folder) that allows anyone else using DAAF to analyze this dataset as if they've been working with it for years\n\nThis is what DAAF's extensible architecture was built to do -- facilitate the rapid but rigorous ingestion, analysis, and interpretation of \\*any\\* data from \\*any\\* field when guided by a skilled researcher. This is the community flywheel I’m hoping to cultivate: the more people using DAAF to ingest and analyze public datasets, the more multi-faceted and expansive DAAF's analytic capabilities become. We've got over 130 unique installs of DAAF as of this morning -- join the ecosystem and help build this inclusive community for rigorous, AI-empowered research!\n\nIf you haven't heard of DAAF, learn more about my vision for DAAF, what makes DAAF different from other attempts to create LLM research assistants, what DAAF currently can and cannot do as of today, how you can get involved, and how you can get started with DAAF yourself at the GitHub page:\n\n[https://github.com/DAAF-Contribution-Community/daaf](https://github.com/DAAF-Contribution-Community/daaf)\n\n**Bonus**: The Election data Skill is now part of the core DAAF repository. Go use it and play around with it yourself!!!",
