      "text": "Hello all, I got my Data Science Masters in May 2024, I went to school part time while working in cybersecurity. I tried getting a job in data science after graduation but couldn't even get an interview I continued on with my cybersecurity job which I absolutely hate. DS was supposed to be my way out but I feel my degree did little to prepare me for the career field especially after all the layoffs, recruiters seem to hate career changers and cant look past my previous experience in a different field. I want to work in DS but my skills have atrophied badly and I already feel out of date.\n\n I am not sure what to do I hate my current field, cybersecurity is awful, and feel I just wasted my life getting my DS masters, should I take a boot camp would that make me look better to recruiters should I get a second DS masters or an AI specific masters so I can get internships I am at a complete loss how to proceed could use some constructive advice.",

You need to do relevant projects that you can speak to, and maybe apply to some analytics jobs instead of just data science to try to get your foot in the door. Additionally, there’s a chance your resume could use some work. Try to cater your cyber experience in a way that makes it more relevant to DS, and post your resume here or elsewhere to get some advice!

Recent projects are a way to demonstrate that those skills are still being used. \n  \nNot all projects carry the same weight. If you list a Titanic survival predictor, a Boston housing price predictor, or an Iris classifier as projects it's going to do nothing for you. What you need to do is pick a problem you want to solve, then take that project from start to finish. Don't start with a dataset, start with a problem then find appropriate datasets. That's how it works in the real world. You're probably going to have to do some work to get your data in a format that will be useful for solving your problem. That's a good thing. That's what 80%+ of the work is as a DS. \n  \nGo ahead and build your model, but don't stop there. Take the project to its conclusion. When you defined your problem, you should have defined a format for your solution. It might be a writeup detailing the results. It might be a dashboard that updates as new data comes in. It might be an app or API endpoint you can hit with new data to get a result. It should not just be a model or a Jupyter notebook. That's where homework assignments end. It's not where production ML solutions end. \n  \nDoing projects like that is hard. It will differentiate you from your peers though and it will prepare you for working in the field. There's going to be a lot of shit you don't know how to do. Good. There's a lot of shit that you won't know how to do as you transition from a DS masters to working as a DS.",

The ETA of the various cyber security data sets that you have access to with your employer may give you an idea for an additional project that uses ML.\n\nNow imagine applying for a security analytics position with experience in cybersecurity and performing analytics for cyber security (which you will have from your projects).

He has been pursuing the idea of the perfect DS job for years now (taking the extra time to get degrees/certifications). It’s the wrong way to look at the job market (he is still looking BTW).\n\nMultiple Master’s degrees in the same field are not going to help you here (if anything, it signals that you’re devaluing the first Master’s degree) and most bootcamps (not all) are worthless. A degree does not earn you the right to a job or to be seen by a recruiter.\n\nBootcamps are useful resources for on-the-job training, not to get the job.\n\nI don’t know where you’ve applied but the job market in general is VERY saturated at the moment for tech people. You’re competing with a lot more people who have more experience, so you likely should temper your expectations and cast your net more broadly. Look for DS job postings across multiple sectors (insurance, banking, retail, etc) that some would not initially think of as offering DS jobs. Also look for “data analyst” roles as well as data engineering roles.\n\nNot all jobs that do DS are labeled as such. It’s more important that you just get a job that is DS-related first to break into the DS job market. Stay in that position for a while to build up experience and then move on. Otherwise you’ll enter this cycle of analysis paralysis and pursuing degrees when the real problem is you need to be more creative in how you find jobs.",

The other alternative is to do the same but use it to network.  Applying to DS jobs blindly has a 10-15 percent chance of getting a job. Creating a network and advocating yourself gives you a better chance at obtaining DS opportunities.  I am in the same position… earned a MS in Cybersecurity but never really obtained a job in this field so went to earn a MS in DS and found my niche there.  But most of it was through wird if mouth and networking.  I am hoping to combine both and create my own business incorporating AI.  Both career fields are saturated but it is what you bring to the table that holds the most weight.",

Truth is that for most DS roles, you’ll need to be proficient with how to apply and use the current models, start thinking about the whole DS process as a system, be proficient on the data engineering side of things, and probaly most importantly, be really good at story telling, and selling your analyses to key stakeholders. DS is no longer just about coding and tuning model parameters. You’ll need to really be able to run the full process.  \n\nId suggest doing a simple personal project but impactful findings, upload to a git repo, make that git repo well documented, and add that to your resume.\n\nAdditionally, networking + luck has a lot to do with how people land roles nowadays. Also expand role search into smaller areas of the market to get some experience. Not sure where you’re applying to.",

The market shifted fast and DS roles tightened right as a lot of people were graduating, which makes it feel personal even when it isn’t. From what I’ve seen, another degree or bootcamp rarely fixes the core issue, it just delays it and adds more cost. Recruiters aren’t rejecting you because you lack credentials, they’re struggling to map your past experience to the roles they’re hiring for.\n\nOne thing that might help is reframing rather than restarting. Cybersecurity plus data skills can be a strong combo if you lean into applied problems like detection, monitoring, fraud, or analytics tied to security outcomes. That gives you a narrative that feels coherent instead of “career changer.” Skill atrophy is real, but it’s usually reversible with a focused project that mirrors an actual job problem rather than generic notebooks.\n\nI’d be cautious about chasing internships or more schooling unless you have a very specific target role that requires it. Try to get as close as possible to the work you want while still employed, even if it’s internal projects or side work that looks unglamorous. The emotional weight here is heavy, but this doesn’t read like wasted time to me. It reads like bad timing plus unclear positioning, which is fixable even if it takes longer than you hoped.",

A master’s teaches concepts, not how hiring actually works, and a lot of people find that out the hard way.\n\nI was a career changer too, and recruiters definitely latch onto your last job like it defines you forever. What helped me wasn’t another degree or bootcamp, it was building a few small, real projects and sharing them like they were actual work. That shifted the focus away from my past role.\n\nThink of skills like muscle. They don’t vanish, they just get rusty. You don’t fix that by signing up for more school, you fix it by using them again.\n\nBootcamps or a second master’s usually don’t help much if you already have a DS degree. Recruiters care way more about what you’ve actually built than what certificates you collect.\n\nOne thing that helped was having everything in one simple portfolio so I could point people to my DS work instead of explaining myself over and over. I used something like this: [https://saramitchell.professionalsite.me/](https://saramitchell.professionalsite.me/)\n\nSmall funny note: I thought my first project was embarrassingly basic. Turns out recruiters liked it because it looked like real work, not a textbook exercise.\n\nIf you want a next step, I’d say keep your current job for now, build 2–3 practical projects, and make your online presence clearly say “data scientist.” That’s usually enough to get traction.",

But what we look for is obviously basic knowledge, so you need to know what model to use when, AB testing basics, online offline testing how to do it etc. but this is all standard, and with AI u don’t need too much detail or should I say as an interviewer I’m not too bothered if u are not great in coding or have holes in this stuff. AI has made it very easy to code per se, coding is basically dead. \n\nBut what a lot of junior DS don’t have is experience productionising, for obvious reasons. Well if you can learn this and convince the interviewer you have hands on AWS skills. Just create some mock project and run it end to end in the cloud with MLflow and some tracking and an API endpoint to serve. And if you understand basic productionisation and explain that’s why you want the entry position to be able to tackle this…\n\nI can see how you can’t find a job, because I am working at a huge company and we struggling to find good seniors and even juniors that are not just regurgitating the same old thing. \n\nThis is what is valuable and gpt cannot solidly do yet. \n\nAlso no matter what you do, don’t lie, just stick the key words in your CV and be passionate and interested to learn. If a question is asked and you don’t know, don’t bluff express something sensible you think you would try and then don’t bluff. This doesn’t apply for basic questions.

                  "text": "Yes honestly, the space is completely different from pre llms. You for junior, it is not enough to do the theory. Everyone knows the theory plus llms will help you on the job. You need to know how to make money for the company. And that involves productionisation. Getting more and more senior in most DS position is all about knowing how to optimise and shmoozing/convincing stakeholders why ur teams projects are the best. That is all. I can’t speak for FANG, may be different but for all other companies, especially DS in retail banking etc. That’s what it’s all about. Some of my most praised work/highest earning work doesn’t even use ML. Just counts of impressions and then simple rules based recommendations. Only in mature teams, which trust me, isn’t so common, do you apply real ML for real world results. Also in my experience, and this is probably too advanced for junior but good to know, the real blockers/hurdles/challenges are the integration with other teams. You need to be flexible, very proactive, DS is the brains of the company. Problem solving/thinking outside the box is really the most important thing. Not coding or anything else really. This is a rare skill in all domains. \n\nFor junior if I had to pick the key thing I look for when hiring it’s this, in this order of importance high to low: \n\n- 1. Willingness to learn/proactiveness\n- 2. Working well with a team and problem solving\n- 3. Basic ML understanding and keeping up with tech \n\nThese are hard to test in an interview because it requires time with the person (apart from 3) but showing you have productionisation experience or valuable certs are all forms of the first 2 points and will distinguish you from others because they are certainly not easy. I think for junior just the foundational certs would be enough. The ML professional or specialist, I forget, is a little tricky without Aws experience but still doable. \n\nTrust me the info I am giving you here is gold people pay for this :p \n\nBut I just want to say, don’t get disheartened, learn to love the work, I think DS is a wonderful field you can never get bored and there is usually an element of prestige in the company around your team and don’t be worried to go for jobs that are paid less than what you expect, especially if u are just out of uni no dependants and young, money isn’t the most important thing. I am in 6 figures and I started 8 years ago on a 1 month internship with no pay (only my train travel) in a data analytics position but the guy who hired me liked my enthusiasm and said he would like to teach me ML and modelling in the team then the rest is history. I have been offered a job at Facebook last year almost double my salary but I refused it because of relocation issues and really the main reason, I really enjoyed where I was. Your career is YOUR career, for junior positions it’s very important to genuinely show interest. Then 70% of your work becomes enjoyable (we always have 30%) that we usually don’t enjoy. \n\nI think you can apply what I said above for all work really. If you have specific questions feel free to DM me and maybe I’ll find the time to answer but I’ll repeat, don’t get disheartened, search for a job but sign up to free conferences. For example in the UK we have weekly python ones in DS, I forget the name. Go to events, often AWS has events where they hand out vouchers for discounts on their certs and it gives you exposure to what is going on. Ask your thesis supervisor for any positions/people he may know. Be Proactive!!\n\nSending loads of CVs and hoping for the best may work but probably not the best use of your time.\n\nIf you do all of the above, I genuinely, genuinely can’t see how you won’t find an entry level position. Also if you do all of the above and don’t get a job say over a year, then you can give up knowing you did your best. But honestly, this would be very very unlikely. In DS it gets tough when you want the more advanced jobs that pay big big bucks. Because often you need to be a unicorn and know everything, the positions can be rare, and networking/exposure to the correct people is needed as usually you are hired by word of mouth. These jobs are not openly posted. But honestly, most people wouldn’t hack those positions, including myself, as it requires a tremendous amount of work. In my whole career I have only met one person that I genuinely thought was in this category and he basically had no like outside of DS. I think he is not working for Nvidea or databricks as a researcher. \n\nAnyway I’ll stop rambling but my final point is. Yes the market is saturated, because the entry level has reduced, but trust me when I say that the quality of people has also tumbled compared to 8 ish years ago. Which means it is actually easy to get a job if you do the above once you get an interview. If you are interviewing lots in DS and not getting a job then that is a biiiig issue as all companies are looking for technical people they just don’t want to settle for crap.",

You might have something similar for chairs, e.g., \"Chair\", \"Work chair\", \"Desk seating\", etc.  We have hundreds of product types, and they all have roughly similar descriptions but nothing standardized.\n\nI noodled on ways to group these for a while with various approaches - standardizing the text, looking for similarity between words and n-grams, using various algorithms for clustering  the text.  It turns out the easiest thing to do is to create a list of words that you expect like \"Chair\", \"Work surface\", \"Filing\", etc. and pass that with the description text to an LLM and have it return what word is closest to the description.  It can even give you a confidence, so you can find all the lowest confidence words, which usually means they aren't in your list, add those words to the list, and keep iterating until you more or less have a complete list of product types from the description.\n\nAfter it was all said and done, I grabbed a few hundred lines and manually checked them, and had about a 97% accuracy on product description to product group.  Which is pretty great vs the alternative of trying to manually classify these. \n\nThis saved me tons of time, and having standardized product descriptions has been a god send for all sorts of analyses with regards to pricing, vertical market, etc.",

          "text": "Communication. Technical knowledge or algo things are solveable parts. Collaboration is not, and on-point delivery is far more important than solving algo puzzles.\n\nFor example, if you think your chart is clear for outsider to read, trying to read r/dataisbeautiful and see if you can understand the basic/common charts, especially when you're not familiar with the terms/variables.\n\nThe same happened with non-technical stakeholders. Curse of expertise.\n\nThe other thing is to challenge stakeholders at first step. Always asking what's the reason for the ask. Often times, the question is not clear at the beginning. Many people don't know what they want, and frame the question as the wishlist 'Can you increase revenue...?', 'Can you analyze X for opportunities ...?, 'Can you improve X ...?'.... The question is far more important than the solutions.\n\nThe last important thing is to treat DS as a business product, not a scientific output. Product/business teams are not scientists. Scientists work to seek truth. Even then, the truths don't always stand the test of time. Newtons' laws of physics are true until centuries later. And it took almost 100 years before we could support Einstein 's relativity theory.\n\nDS teams in business are not creating new knowledge for truth. The ultimate goal is to create products to improve users/clients' lives.  It's important to be aware that our work are not truths. They are merely confirming or disconfirming evidence that either supports or refutes the viewpoint. The goal, also, is not seeking truth but to mitigate risks.",

However, since then, Opus 4.5 was launched, and I have almost exclusively been using Cursor in combination with Claude Code.\n\n* I've been focusing a lot on prompts, skills, subagents, MCP, and slash commands to speed up and improve workflows [similar to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ciJedw2vU).\n\n* Recently, I have been experimenting with [Claudish](https://github.com/MadAppGang/claudish), which allows for plugging any model into Claude Code. Also, I have been transitioning to use [Marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) instead of Jupyter Notebooks.\n\nI've roughly tripled my productivity since October, maybe even 5x in some workflows.\n\nI'm curious to know what has changed for you since last year.",

Now it takes half a day at most. \n\nThe tools have also just gotten way better. I remember before I had a lot of issues with hallucinations with Cursor + Sonnet 3.5 and doing weird things with my PyTorch models but I rarely get that now with Claude Code + Sonnet 4.5\n\nI do check everything often. Sometimes I'll have a script to test things or create a plot and check that everything looks sensible. Sometimes I will review the code directly. ",

That's probably a relatively safe area for a data scientist to continue to provide value. \n\nBeyond that, your guess is as good as mine. I'm trying to think about how things were 10 years ago: data scientists were called statisticians back then. And I couldn't have predicted the growth of machine learning and AI. \n\nFor what it's worth I think there is still a pretty key difference between me using Claude code versus one of my non-technical colleagues. I definitely have much more computing and data science knowledge that helps me approach certain problems much better. ",

I even started answering Stack Overflow questions for a few years. I cared about the little details to make charts client- or publication-ready, e.g., code patterns to match legend entries, choosing line continuation style.\n\nA bit later, I absorbed the pandas API through again countless hours of real world usage, sifting docs, and grinding through error messages and Stack Overflow. I found joy in becoming fluent in taking some starting data and reshaping it almost in realtime to whatever my task required. In my relatively narrow analytics style types of problems asked of me, I fell into the role of go-to pandas helper when colleagues got stuck or didn't know how to do something, and I'd work with them in their Jupyter notebook to chain the right methods, massively improve run time, or resolve confusing error messages seemingly through magic (looking at you, SettingWithCopyWarning).\n\nI'm in the same line of work as before, and my employer pays for various AI coding tools, including Cursor and Claude Code. I have directly written _maybe_ a dozen lines of python code in the last 4 months. Experimenting with models and prompting and reviewing their outputs has given me enough confidence that it is more time-efficient for me to tell a chat window what I need compared to using my keyboard to type the code like it's 2023.\n\nI don't really know where I'm going with this, or what the implications are for data science, software dev, and knowledge work in general. I've accepted that my particular sector / industry / flavor of \"data science\" is just not actually novel or innovative in any way, and as a result, AI (via sufficiently powerful products, used by someone with _some_ background in their use and the task at hand) has already rendered hands-on coding largely obsolete. Data science is continually evolving, we signed up for lifelong adaptation and learning, etc etc, but it feels very weird to realize that the workplace conditions that gave me years of experience no longer exist, and that experience is now best used in a tech manager / specification / review role rather than individual contributor.",

Client decrease in funding basically ended that company making us scramble for a new solution.  My DS team and I had experience developing software and we were asked to rebuilt what they had done.  You can call it a light-ish version.  We scaled back a few things and rewrote the code in Python (because AWS Lambda likes that language).  We deployed a web UI frontend and an AWS API backend on S3.  Using just ChatGPT alone we were able to fly through the frontend like it was nothing.  We put together alternate protypes in a matter of minutes.  Cleaned up the code and deployed within days.  The backend required more human knowledge on systems and integration with clients and ChatGPT/Claude didn't really help there.  But we were able to build the API endpoints that were written in Python within a day or two and it helped us identify a few bugs we introduced.  Most of the time was spent just figuring out how the clients would interact with the API and trying to make it backward compatible and similar to what they previously had.  Since we already had a good baseline of software development practices the 2-3 (2 actual developers) of us were able to build everything a team of about 20 used to do.  Anything we didn't know we put our heads down and learned.  We just sped things along and were able to iterate at an incredible speed.\n\nTesting and cleaning up code of course still takes time.  But we had a usable system up and running within days, started our internal testing right after that, and deployed a minimal viable product to clients within about a month.  What we did we estimated it would have taken the other company about 6 months to do (I don't want to be dismissive because they were an amazing company, they were just on the short end of major budget cuts).  Granted, we were given permission to run fast and break things.  We're still developing on it but we're now just iterating within our internal teams and with clients on the extent of the new features we're going to add.\n\n  \nThe massive time saver was in the web UI development.  Frankly, it's unreal.  Create 5 different completely working prototypes?  Done in minutes.  Having an annoying bug that's been plaguing you for the last month and you're just not sure how to handle it?  Fixed in minutes.  Javascript not doing what you thought it should do?  Fixed.  Building the API endpoints was a bit more nuanced but boy did that save a massive amount of time writing Python code and referring to Python library documentation for specific functions.  And now I don't have to search through long forgotten StackOverflow discussions.",

Since then I've built a webserver for model inference with fastapi+uvicorn, made data validation with pydantic and pandera a standard part of my workflow, switched to uv+pyproject instead of just pip+requirements, and am nearing the finish line on an internal-use python library with actual proper testing, an mkdocs site and proper CI/CD with GitHub actions. I've learned all sorts of level 2 python stuff like generics and discriminated unions with pydantic, custom decorators, registries, meta classes, dynamic attribute resolution with my own stub files, JIT compilation with numba and full use of static typing (goddamn life saver that is). Also I switched to Linux.",

It’s not uncommon for data to show up in a wonky format that requires you to write something a bit custom to process it. It’s also a good idea to know how Python classes work, because all the DS libraries you’ll use are really just collections of classes and functions that contain for loops, if-else, methods (functions attached to classes), etc. \n\nUnderstanding how base Python works will make it a lot easier to use the DS libraries, because you go from “I just memorized the letters that make this thing happen” to “Ahh, so this is regression model and its results are stored in a class, and this method produces this type of object, which means I can access this information in this part of the object, iterate over this other thing if I need to,” and so on. \n\nNow, if they start teaching you how to create APIs and front ends, mayyyyybe that’s a bit far for now.

Can dive deep in one or two domains. \n\n  \nHow this manifests in the interview:\n\n\\* During an ML, Experimentation, or system design case study - needs little prompting to arrive at a good solution. Can articulate business constraints and methodology clearly. Is able to constructively react to feedback.   \n\\* Behavioral interviews - shows the ability to collaborate with other business functions.

I ultimately said I was a bit concerned that they lacked technical maturity and that they were facing some hype cycle issues along with them not forseeing some economic and contractual issues... and sure enough within the following weeks they lost a bunch of revenue due to Trump policies and canceled the position.    \n  \nMeanwhile I'm about burned out at my current position, particularly in this current administration - but given I got into machine learning and AI back in 2015 and started investing in 2017 and my previously modest portfolio blew up to multi-millions thanks to NVDA, I've frankly been de-risking and de-prioritizing everything, moving tranches of NVDA stock to safer investments before the AI bubble deflates.

You need to be able to ask questions and tease out what's important to the client then come up with ways to deliver on that. \n\nThere are also many more questions about how to scope out large projects and work across teams. You're going to get several questions on how to mentor Junior data scientists.\n\nOne thing I did notice from both my own interviews and when I was interviewing senior managers at my old job was that there's a greater emphasis on industry specific knowledge. \n\nWhen you just get out of school and are taking that first job, no one really expects you to understand their industry. They can plug your standard data scientist into a healthcare organization, a marketing organization, banking, etc. \n\nAs you go to the senior level and beyond you going to start getting questions that are much more industry specific.  The closer your existing experience is to the industry you're applying for the easier your interview will go. \n\nI saw this when I was interviewing senior managers. We had some technically proficient folks who just didn't understand our industry (marketing analytics) and you could definitely see the gap between them and someone who worked in our industry before.  The same held true for my recent interviews.",

If you can derive gradients at a high level and explain convex vs non convex behavior qualitatively, that usually satisfies interviewers. I would spend more time practicing explaining concepts clearly than memorizing niche proofs that may never come up.",

The examples you mentioned are more about showing conceptual understanding than rigorous proof-writing. Companies care more about whether you can explain why MSE with a sigmoid creates multiple local minima, or why minimizing within-cluster variance naturally leads to using the mean. If you can walk through the logic clearly and show you understand the underlying math, that's usually enough. Focus on being able to derive and explain gradient descent, the bias-variance tradeoff, why regularization works, how different loss functions behave, and the assumptions behind common algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, and SVMs.\n\nThat said, some research-heavy roles or quant positions might dig deeper into formal derivations, so it's worth practicing the classics: deriving the closed-form solution for linear regression, showing convexity of log loss, proving convergence properties of simple optimization algorithms, and understanding maximum likelihood estimation. The key is being able to explain your reasoning out loud as you work through it - interviewers want to see your thought process, not a memorized proof. If you're worried about handling these kinds of questions on the spot, I built [AI assistant for interviews](http://interviews.chat) with my team to help people respond to tough technical questions like these in real-time, so you can get comfortable explaining complex concepts under pressure.",

And I managed through trial and error on my own to learn the ins and outs of the client platform, teach myself Python, learn the lingo, state the problem I wanted to solve, find and access the public database, test, assess, make mistakes, scream at my laptop, be grateful for GitHub, and build a solution over many steps, trying this, trying that, reaching my conclusion (destination). When all the kinks were smoothed, I then got filmed walking through the whole analysis. The client was very happy, and I looked like I knew what I was doing. \n\nIf you have a nice, thorny problem you are looking to solve, and have robust and even messy data you can access and might even know another language to double check whether you are getting things right, you can pick up the basics of Python, which is pretty straightforward to master.

My spouse and I took turns watching her and caring for her while the other was at work.  This was getting difficult as back-forth texting on her \"current status\" of feeding/pooping/diapering were inefficient.  So I create a simple google form that my spouse and I used to log her feeding and pooping/peeing/diapering data on.  This google form fed to a Streamlit page. Voila!  Not only did we have visual metrics for us, we even had it for her pediatric doctor! \n\n  \nCat feeding tracker  \n\\----\n\nMy cat, baby, who has now passed had health issues.  She would be \"ok\" for several days and then in \"poor shape\" for suddenly.  The thing with cats is they don't express gradually increasing pain or discomfort as well as dogs do.  However, I Found that my cat's eating habits (mainly how many times she was at the food bowl and how many grams of dry food she consumed) were an early warning to upcoming health events.  Same idea as the baby tracker, but this time it was a food tracker.  Yes, I was able to identify her demise 3-4 days in advance. No, I could not do anything about it. \n\n  \nCat habit tracker.  \n\\----\n\nI hated leaving my cat by herself when I traveled.  So I installed Raspberry Pi cameras in most of my houses to track what she was upto when I am away.  Additionally, I could log into these Pis remotely, upload audio clips, and play them if necessary.  Anyway, I used MotionOS/MotionDetect on all the cams, with appropriately tuned motion sensitivity, to track my cat's whereabouts and upload time stamps, room locations, and pictures to a dropbox folder.

You can probably find code used to solve very similar problems but you’ll need to edit it or slightly alter the logic to fit your situation, which will require some thinking and will lead to understanding",

At some point, AI will complexify your code beyond your level of understanding. Start with something you want to do or a problem you want to solve, today there is data about pretty much everything, so you will certainly find a topic you take interest in.\n\nBefore coding, make sure the library or external tools you're going to use are suited for your problem.

Salaries seem to be much lower for market research roles needing the same years of experience compared to data science roles, at least until you get to more senior management levels. But, hot take, I actually think market research can be a better training ground for senior leadership roles down the road than data science, if that might be of interest for your career. You get much better at presenting findings and influencing senior leaders than most data scientists ever will. I've learned much more from mentors with MR backgrounds about navigating politics and exec presence than I have from those with DS or BI backgrounds. I've sometimes reported into VP+ who were MR and not DS, and the MR leaders were so much better to work with than the DS leaders, who were weaker strategically and politically.\n\nI'll also say there is so much opportunity for market researchers to bring over better tooling and methodologies from data scientists. You could have potential for faster promotion within the market research sphere with above-average analytical acumen and technical skills. I consistently saw that my MR colleagues were limited in their study design choices because they couldn't self-serve data from SQL warehouses and data lakes to do things like evaluate different segmentations and stratification strategies. They could only pull super basic things themselves and otherwise were bumbling around in SPSS and Excel to analyze results from research vendors. I had to frequently troubleshoot odd findings by helping them understand that, for example, the overly coarse frequency bins they used to create survey segments and differential response rates were masking what was actually going on. They treated my data science team like we were wizards when we collaborated because that kind of thing was easy for us.",

Bonus points if the project has real usage or an active community.\n3. **Personal or academic projects:** Here I’m trying to gauge creativity and intellectual rigor—how the candidate thinks, frames problems, and explores ideas.\n\nWhat I generally don’t care about is “Kaggle-style” optimization for its own sake. Increasing accuracy from 85% to 88% doesn’t matter to me unless it led to meaningful real-world impact. In my experience, most data-science problems are constrained less by modeling sophistication and more by how well the data scientist understands the stakeholder’s problem.\n\nA common blind spot I see—especially among early-career data scientists, including a younger version of myself—is over-indexing on model tuning and technical rabbit holes, when the bigger opportunity is often to spend more time talking with stakeholders and clarifying what actually matters.",

My work involves implementing C++ signal processing algorithms, leveraging multi-core and hardware acceleration, analyzing radar datasets, and some exposure to ML algorithms.\n\nI’m trying to figure out the best path to break into data science roles. I’m debating between:\n\nLeveraging my current skills to transition directly into data science, emphasizing my experience with signal analysis, ML exposure, and dataset handling.\n\nDoing research with a professor to strengthen my ML/data experience and possibly get publications.\n\nPursuing a dedicated Master’s in Data Science to formally gain data engineering, Python, and ML skills.\n\nMy questions are:\n\nHow much does experience with embedded/real-time signal processing matter for typical data science roles?\n\nCan I realistically position myself for data science jobs by building projects with Python/PyTorch and data analysis, without a second degree?\n\nWould research experience (e.g., with a professor) make a stronger impact than self-directed projects?\n\nI’d love advice on what recruiters look for in candidates with technical backgrounds like mine, and the most efficient path to data science.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Or find DS roles that are about signal processing, like DS related to Hardware, or Bayer Crops has information from sensors.\n\nYes, research with a professor would strengthen your profile. And yes, it would be better to do that versus a \"self-directed project\". Work with a professor is better because it has a stamp of approval and also, professors have high standards and don't just take anyone. Having an RA is a lot of work for the professor because it's not like you can do everything on your own and you need supervision. So if they take it, it means you are already better than the average student. It's a strong signal on a resume. Anyone can make their own lame projects, but very few have research experience or even publications. Even a poster at a conference would be great.\n\nNo, masters in DS would not help. Probably one in ML or computer science would be better, but I would try to get a job before doing that.\n\nTry doing an official cloud certification and a project using that cloud platform first.\n\nMaybe a C++ official certification could be good for a SWE / MLE route. Some languages have official certifications from their 'institutes' and C++ is one of them. I would ask if that's helpful in one of the swe reddits.\n\nThe reason why I'm discouraging against DS is because the gap between MLE and DS is broadening, and many DS jobs are going into Analytics jobs. Your profile is closer to SWE / MLE. Also, for new grads, it's a lot 'easier' to get new grad jobs in SWE. It's hard but it's a LOT easier than getting one in DS which is nearly impossible and also, DS would put you further away from the type of jobs you'd want. Interviews for MLE are almost SWE interviews. \n\nAlso, start looking for internships.",

      "text": "For the last few years my job has centered around making humans like the output of LLMs. The main problem is that, in the applications I work on, the humans tend to know a lot more than I do. Sometimes the AI model outputs great stuff, sometimes it outputs horrible stuff. I can't tell the difference, but the users (who are subject matter experts) can.\n\nI have a lot of opinions about testing and how it should be done, which I've written about extensively (mostly in a RAG context) if you're curious.\n\n\\- [Vector Database Accuracy at Scale](https://www.eyelevel.ai/post/do-vector-databases-lose-accuracy-at-scale?utm_source=x&utm_medium=social&utm_id=santiago-rag2)  \n\\- [Testing Document Contextualized AI](https://iaee.substack.com/p/testing-document-contextualized-ai)  \n\\- [RAG evaluation](https://www.eyelevel.ai/post/how-to-test-rag-and-agents-in-the-real-world)\n\nFor the sake of this discussion, let's take for granted that you know what the actual problem is in your AI app (which is not trivial). There's another problem which we'll concern ourselves in this particular post. If you know what's wrong with your AI system, how do you make it better? That's the point, to discuss making maintainable AI systems.\n\nI've been [bullish about AI agents for a while now](https://iaee.substack.com/p/the-future-is-agentic-5c644f6b8f5b), and it seems like the industry has come around to the idea. they can break down problems into sub-problems, ponder those sub-problems, and use external tooling to help them come up with answers. Most developers are familiar with the approach and understand its power, but I think many are under-appreciative of their drawbacks from a maintainability prospective.\n\nWhen people discuss \"AI Agents\", I find they're typically referring to what I like to call an \"Unconstrained Agent\". When working with an unconstrained agent, you give it a query and some tools, and let it have at it. The agent thinks about your query, uses a tool, makes an observation on that tools output, thinks about the query some more, uses another tool, etc. This happens on repeat until the agent is done answering your question, at which point it outputs an answer. This was proposed in the landmark paper \"ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models\" which I discuss at length in [this article](https://iaee.substack.com/p/llm-agents-intuitively-and-exhaustively-explained-8905858e18e2?utm_source=publication-search). This is great, especially for open ended systems that answer open ended questions like ChatGPT or Google (I think this is more-or-less what's happening when ChatGPT \"thinks\" about your question, though It also probably does some reasoning model trickery, [a-la deepseek](https://iaee.substack.com/p/deepseek-r1-intuitively-and-exhaustively?utm_source=publication-search)). \n\nThis unconstrained approach isn't so great, I've found, when you build an AI agent to do something specific and complicated. If you have some logical process that requires a list of steps and the agent messes up on step 7, it's hard to change the agent so it will be right on step 7, without messing up its performance on steps 1-6. It's hard because, the way you define these agents, you tell it how to behave, then it's up to the agent to progress through the steps on its own. Any time you modify the logic, you modify all steps, not just the one you want to improve. I've heard people use \"whack-a-mole\" when referring to the process of improving agents. This is a big reason why.\n\nI call graph based agents \"constrained agents\", in contrast to the \"unconstrained agents\" we discussed previously. Constrained agents allow you to control the logical flow of the agent and its decision making process. You control each step and each decision independently, meaning you can add steps to the process as necessary.\n\n[Imagine you developed a graph which used an LLM to introduce itself to the user, then progress to general questions around qualification \\(1\\). You might decide this is too simple, and opt to check the user's response to ensure that it does contain a name before progressing \\(2\\). Unexpectedly, maybe some of your users don’t provide their full name after you deploy this system to production. To solve this problem you might add a variety of checks around if the name is a full name, or if the user insists that the name they provided is their full name \\(3\\).](https://preview.redd.it/3ini75u95tbg1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f7960052ed2df34afec0ee969d337b45e9a0a97)\n\n[image source](https://iaee.substack.com/p/langgraph-intuitively-and-exhaustively?utm_source=publication-search)\n\nThis allows you to much more granularly control the agent at each individual step, adding additional granularity, specificity, edge cases, etc. This system is much, much more maintainable than unconstrained agents. I [talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N59Z7uJ8DDA&t=444s) with some folks at [arize](https://arize.com/) a while back, a company focused on AI observability. Based on their experience at the time of the conversation, the vast amount of actually functional agentic implementations in real products tend to be of the constrained, rather than the unconstrained variety.\n\nI think it's worth noting, these approaches aren't mutually exclusive. You can run a ReAct style agent within a node within a graph based agent, allowing you to allow the agent to function organically within the bounds of a subset of the larger problem. That's why, in my workflow, graph based agents are the first step in building any agentic AI system. They're more modular, more controllable, more flexible, and more explicit.",

Once the logic gets even mildly complex, unconstrained agents feel brittle and hard to debug because everything is entangled. The graph based framing makes it much easier to reason about failure modes and to fix one step without breaking five others. I also like the idea of letting a more freeform agent live inside a bounded node when you actually want exploration. Curious how you handle versioning and testing of the graph itself as it grows, since that seems like the next maintainability cliff.",

If two features are highly correlated but only one is interpretable or actionable for the use case, dropping the other may reduce complexity without changing what anyone would do differently.\nCurious how you think about that tradeoff when model performance and decision usefulness don’t perfectly align.",

Zero system dependencies.\n\n**What it handles:**\n\n* Legacy Office: `.doc`, `.xls`, `.ppt`\n* Modern Office: `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`\n* OpenDocument: `.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`\n* PDF, Email (`.eml`, `.msg`, `.mbox`), HTML, plain text formats\n\n**Basic usage:**\n\npython\n\n    import sharepoint2text\n    \n    result = next(sharepoint2text.read_file(\"document.docx\"))\n    text = result.get_full_text()\n    \n    # Or iterate by page/slide/sheet for RAG chunking\n    for unit in result.iterate_units():\n        chunk = unit.get_text()\n\nAlso extracts tables, images, and metadata. Has a CLI. JSON serialization built in.\n\n**Install:** `uv add sharepoint-to-text` or `pip install sharepoint-to-text`\n\n**Trade-offs to be aware of:**\n\n* No OCR - scanned PDFs return empty text\n* Password-protected files are rejected\n* Word docs don't have page boundaries (that's a format limitation, not ours)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/Horsmann/sharepoint-to-text](https://github.com/Horsmann/sharepoint-to-text)\n\nHappy to answer questions or take feedback.",

          "text": "**TL;DR:**\n\n  \nI’m a 37-year-old female Data Scientist based in Shanghai (US-educated, ML/finance background) earning \\~750k RMB/year. I hold Canadian PR (FSW), but I’ll lose it if I don’t meet the residency obligation by late April 2026. With a one-month notice period, I realistically need to decide by end of March 2026. I’m weighing whether it makes sense—career-wise—to step away from an established role to preserve PR, versus letting the PR lapse and accepting that trade-off.\n\n**What I’m hoping to learn (especially from this community)**\n\nI’m looking for **data-driven, experience-based input**, not general encouragement.\n\nIn particular, I’d value perspectives from:\n\n* **Data Scientists / ML Engineers currently working in Canada** (Toronto/GTA or Vancouver preferred):\n   * How is the market *actually* behaving right now for senior-ish profiles?\n   * What comp ranges (base + bonus/equity) are realistic for someone with US degrees, fintech/finance experience, and 10+ YOE?\n* **People who relocated mid-career to Canada to satisfy PR requirements:**\n   * Did the career reset end up being temporary or structural?\n   * Any surprises you wish you’d factored in earlier?\n* **Anyone with hindsight-driven regret**, regardless of which choice you made—and why.\n\nI’m trying to evaluate this as a **career optimization problem under immigration constraints**, not a lifestyle or ideological decision. Clear trade-offs, market realities, and second-order effects are especially welcome.\n\nThanks for reading, and I appreciate any candid insights you’re willing to share.",
