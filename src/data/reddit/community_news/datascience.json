Then you have the option to do multiple rounds of coarse-to-fine random search from there.\n\nIf you're training larger or more expensive models, this may be where you stop due to budget or time constraints. I would say this is a concern if you're using more heavy duty neural nets for nlp, vision etc. but not typically for xgboost. More searching [gives better expected results](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03004) if you can fit it in your budget.\n\nThen once you have confidence you've narrowed down the neighborhood you're looking in, you can try Bayesian optimization using the validation metrics collected so far as a starting point. This part is just squeezing out the last little bits of performance.\n\nHyper parameter tuning with different frameworks usually let you pick the number of runs per round and the first round will usually do a random search for you before moving to Bayesian optimization. Just make sure the number of models in the initial round is not too small.\n\nEdit: hyperlinks properly working",

If you're doing an exhaustive grid search, I would recommend using the different optimizer/search methods.  \nIt will likely take a fraction of the time with other methods, and even if you don't get the best of the best hyper parameters it'll likely only differ from the absolute best by an insignificant amount in terms of the metric you're using.\n\nFor relatively simple and small models, I find [Halving Grid Search ](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV) is a fast and simple way that gets decent enough results.

From the beginning, the hiring manager seemed a bit disinterested and it felt like he was chatting with someone else during the interview. At one point I even saw him smiling while I was talking, and I was not saying anything remotely amusing.\n\nThat really threw me off and I got distracted, which led to me not answering some questions as well as I should have. The questions were about my past experience, things I definitely knew, and I think that ultimately contributed to my rejection.\n\nI was really looking forward to interviewing there, and in hindsight I feel like I could have done much better, especially if I had prepared a bit more.

Try to extract one or two concrete lessons, like better prep for storytelling or strategies to stay grounded when the vibe feels off, and then consciously let the rest go. Replaying every moment usually just makes it heavier than it deserves to be.\n\nAlso, a single interview does not define your ability or your trajectory.

          "text": "No questions myself but wanted to open myself to questions for folks who are looking to transition into the field or grow their DS career. I’m a staff-level data scientist at a hyperscaler in SF that you have heard of. I’ve been in the field for 6 years now. I come from a non-conventional background (before DS I worked in various roles across warehouse ops for an ecommerce startup, management consulting, and finance). \n\n[please don’t message me for a referral - I typically only refer folks I can vouch for personally 🙏]\n\n\n- EQ > IQ. DS is a field that attracts a lot of smart, quiet introverts. Working on sociability, networking, and “putting yourself out there” returns far higher dividends than polishing your resume or gaining more and more tech skills. It may surprise you but speaking to folks at conferences, parties, or worst case LinkedIn messaging your school alumni can open lots of unexpected doors. \n- The same is true on the job. Surprise: people like working with those they like to be around. Landing impact and doing well in your data science role is 75% stakeholder management and 25% actually coding. The most successful DSes aren’t those with the best code, they’re those who can run the business. \n- Data science isn’t an entry level job. An entry level data scientist typically has at least a few years work experience in an adjacent role. I see a lot of folks coming from economic consulting, analytics, product management, and academia. The reason for this is that domain knowledge and business acumen are necessary to translate your technical work into a business result.\n- Breaking into data science can be somewhat random. My best advice for those not in the industry is to look for opportunities to use data science methods to improve processes or change the business wherever you currently work. I landed my first data science role because I started applying data science methods to inventory management, then moved on to support our ads team, and eventually got a new “analytics” job title. That cracked the door open for me to enter data science.",

I have a few questions since I will finalize my higher education soon and I figured that this would be the best place to get good contructive opinions and advice. \n\nI am currently a student in migration studies (BA and currently writing the thesis for the MA). Throughout these studies I have been able to discover different statistical methods of analysis and I have tried to focused on that whenever I had the opportunity. Turns out I really like working with stats and big datasets from formulating a research question to providing clear and comprehensible results with good visualizations. During this MA I have also done an internship at the department of the university where I basically was the 'stats guy' and did a bunch of stuff with a fresh new database and helped every researchers who were working with it. I will also use stats for my thesis. I will do a second MA next year (if I get admitted 🤞) that is much more focused on economy and includes more stats focused courses, nottably econometrics.\n\nWith all of this background I would really like to find a job as a data analyst or anything related to data gathering/vizualization/ risk analysis, etc.. I was wondering if you think that my profile is something common in this job market? From what I have seen online and what information I got from my network, data analysts are needed but many job posts seem to search for profiles in computer science which is not really where I come from. (Btw I live in Scandinavia and can speak French, english and hopefully a nordic language soon)\n\nAnyway, thank you in advance for reading all of this! If you think you have anything interesting to say about this please do😁",

Put another way, our marketing is \"outbound\" in that we are selecting the sample ahead of time that we will be marketing to and than the treatment is applied on them (like a special offer is created for them etc). In these situations there is no \"generating sample over time\", we just cut the treated and control groups, send our marketing communication and monitor both response and $ generated per customer. An offer could have a lower response rate but much higher $ per customer so deciding a winner requires balancing multiple things. \n\nRunning a test longer or shorter isn't as much of a consideration as is size of control group because controlling opportunity cost is much more important, especially if the offer is very rich.",
