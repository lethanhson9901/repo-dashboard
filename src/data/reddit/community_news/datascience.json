I think i'm lucky in the sense that I'm not modeling business stuff and generating reccomendations, I'm building ML models that are user-facing parts of our (SAAS) product. Most of the persuasion I have to do is related to the front-end design and how my model outputs will be shown to users, or downstream logic that uses my models. Sometimes talking down overly ambitious/optimistic-about-the-data project ideas. But overall our company is pretty cohesive when it comes to project priorities. When I do have to pitch something it's generally data infrastructure or tooling (\"if you want a model for that then we're going to need a pipeline to get the relevant unstructured user data in a structured form we can query\"). I recently successfully pitched a project to build an internal python library to contain all the I/O, logging and credential management boilerplate that's currently repeated across various scheduled tasks and inference servers. That was a very easy sell because the benefits to maintainability and dev efficiency are obvious. We recently had to adapt to a change in an upstream API that broke like, a ton of different things that had to be updated individually. Would have been much easier if it was just an update to the shared client library.\n\nMost of the time, project ideas come from the product team and my role is to scope out what's realistic and what's needed for the components that rely on ML.",

I've seen stakeholders' individual priorities were in tension with overall company goals, where their performance was going to be evaluated on launching something, so they pushed forward regardless of data showing this would be detrimental to overall KPIs, and they would do everything they can to take control over analytical narratives by cherry-picking favorable data points. I've seen new functional leaders brought on to be change agents, wanting to be briefed on everything we knew about their function analytically, but then being unwilling to accept that their preconceived notions of what needed to be addressed were off. Quite a few times my team found genuinely big business opportunities, but couldn't sell those in until we had leadership turnover, as the exec over the relevant area and their finance counterpart would swat down discussion because it would highlight bad decisions they had made before. I've had new data science leaders come in wanting to prioritize initiatives already attempted under previous leaders that flopped, and then they stubbornly refused to listen to any of the lessons learned about what led to high effort and limited potential ROI.",

You would think it's them but nah they're revenue generating so the cost center is the one who takes the hit. \n\n  \nVery few employers have data scientists in roles where they impact revenue directly, so what I learned was essentially I want to be in a role that directly impacts revenue or else work somewhere with a huge data culture.",

You might have something similar for chairs, e.g., \"Chair\", \"Work chair\", \"Desk seating\", etc.  We have hundreds of product types, and they all have roughly similar descriptions but nothing standardized.\n\nI noodled on ways to group these for a while with various approaches - standardizing the text, looking for similarity between words and n-grams, using various algorithms for clustering  the text.  It turns out the easiest thing to do is to create a list of words that you expect like \"Chair\", \"Work surface\", \"Filing\", etc. and pass that with the description text to an LLM and have it return what word is closest to the description.  It can even give you a confidence, so you can find all the lowest confidence words, which usually means they aren't in your list, add those words to the list, and keep iterating until you more or less have a complete list of product types from the description.\n\nAfter it was all said and done, I grabbed a few hundred lines and manually checked them, and had about a 97% accuracy on product description to product group.  Which is pretty great vs the alternative of trying to manually classify these. \n\nThis saved me tons of time, and having standardized product descriptions has been a god send for all sorts of analyses with regards to pricing, vertical market, etc.",

Curse of expertise.\n\nThe other thing is to challenge stakeholders at first step. Always asking what's the reason for the ask. Often times, the question is not clear at the beginning. Many people don't know what they want, and frame the question as the wishlist 'Can you increase revenue...?', 'Can you analyze X for opportunities ...?, 'Can you improve X ...?'....

Scientists work to seek truth. Even then, the truths don't always stand the test of time. Newtons' laws of physics are true until centuries later. And it took almost 100 years before we could support Einstein 's relativity theory.\n\nDS teams in business are not creating new knowledge for truth. The ultimate goal is to create products to improve users/clients' lives.  It's important to be aware that our work are not truths.

He says stuff like \"I'm focused\", \"Don't be distractive\" bla bla. He also said that \"You are not working at all\" because I'm managing my time in a more flexible way.

How that communication works is not fully under your control as it depends on company culture and the expectations of others. So you end up having a lot of meeting throughout the day. \n\nSome of these meetings need to be prepared, others need follow-up, and besides that, you might still have some tasks that need focused work.\n\nThis leaves only a couple of time slots per day for that work. Many people cannot switch context every few minutes while staying productive. For more complex stuff, I need a good half hour of focus to ramp up and really get into it, if that’s interrupted, I’m not getting anything done.\n\nSo it makes sense that your colleague asks you to do tasks another time even if they would cost you only a couple of minutes (the might cost him the short focus time slot that he has).\n\nOf course there’s always a tradeoff: if I insist on my focus time, someone else like you has to wait.

Of course I don’t want to be that guy, so most of the time I stop my work and see if I can help them out in a few minutes.

This is the result of bad management that creates chaos and overworks people. Often the PMs are the ones who have to fix this by being extremely fast with everything and maintain a good flow of information between the departments.

It sounds like OP keeps trying to just drop by the PM's office and talk things over, and as a result of OP just always stopping by, it seems like OP isn't as busy since OP is always finding time to show up at PM's office, despite PM repeatedly asking OP to book time to talk. \n\nOP keeps thinking that his time is the most important, and he wants to solve things now, and there is also the possibility that because OP wants to solve things now, and can't because PM is booked, its coming across in OP's status reports, whether or not OP means it to, that OP is putting delays on deliverables at the feet of delays in communication",

This PM is working hard, but he's also being an out-of-touch asshole for casting this on you.\n\nThe kind of work that this PM does is different. It's the kind where it's easy to look like you're constantly working, but doesn't require the intense problem-solving and attention to detail that data science needs. It's easier to do, and so the volume is higher, but that also means you need to be constantly turned on and you don't get a lot of chance to actually think deeply about anything.\n\nI also used to do a very low volume of work before I got better at time management and was put on ADHD meds. With my improved skills and abilities, I am definitely as busy as I look, but I don't feel much more impactful. A lot of the work that I have done goes unrecognised because it's not what the company really cares about, which is my bad, and I'll be changing my focus next year.\n\nThe point is that just because you can do more doesn't mean you can do work he business cares about. In this way, working less can be better because when you have less time  you spend less time on bullshit.\n\nThe point is that the value of DS work tends to be very 80-20, where what looks like a small amount of work ends up driving a large amount of value. But that 20% of work is *hard* and intellectually taxing because it requires you to actually to think in concrete tems and to actually find the right questions to ask and deal with the inconvienient reality of things in a way that sitting in meetings all day just doesn't require.\n\nI'm happy to give the PM his due because all jobs are hard, but to say \"youre not working at all\" is so fucking out of line by that logic. There's a reason he's a PM and not a DS, because it's the kind of work he may actually struggle with if he had to do it, and a lot of us actually *do* struggle becauses it *is* hard.",

All those meetings are very necessary in large companies, if you want to get anything done. \n\nIt's very noticeable when you have a good PM, and it's amazing. But it can be hard to tell without being closely involved when a PM is manufacturing worthless work for themselves without achieving much. Over simplifying, but projects with bad PMs tend to stagnate and churn. Projects with good PMs just run smoothly. In both cases the PMs might appear to be doing very similar things.  \n\nAll that said, he also sounds like he's kind of an asshole. And/or your problem is not important to him.

Most “prove this” questions are really testing whether you understand the intuition and can walk through the reasoning, not whether you can do a formal textbook proof on a whiteboard.\n\nThe ones worth being comfortable with are bias variance intuition, why least squares leads to the mean, why cross entropy pairs with logistic regression, and how regularization changes the objective. If you can derive gradients at a high level and explain convex vs non convex behavior qualitatively, that usually satisfies interviewers. I would spend more time practicing explaining concepts clearly than memorizing niche proofs that may never come up.",

          "text": "Most ML interviews don't actually ask you to write out formal mathematical proofs on a whiteboard - they want to see that you understand the intuition and can explain why certain things work the way they do. The examples you mentioned are more about showing conceptual understanding than rigorous proof-writing. Companies care more about whether you can explain why MSE with a sigmoid creates multiple local minima, or why minimizing within-cluster variance naturally leads to using the mean. If you can walk through the logic clearly and show you understand the underlying math, that's usually enough. Focus on being able to derive and explain gradient descent, the bias-variance tradeoff, why regularization works, how different loss functions behave, and the assumptions behind common algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, and SVMs.\n\nThat said, some research-heavy roles or quant positions might dig deeper into formal derivations, so it's worth practicing the classics: deriving the closed-form solution for linear regression, showing convexity of log loss, proving convergence properties of simple optimization algorithms, and understanding maximum likelihood estimation. The key is being able to explain your reasoning out loud as you work through it - interviewers want to see your thought process, not a memorized proof. If you're worried about handling these kinds of questions on the spot, I built [AI assistant for interviews](http://interviews.chat) with my team to help people respond to tough technical questions like these in real-time, so you can get comfortable explaining complex concepts under pressure.",

I ultimately said I was a bit concerned that they lacked technical maturity and that they were facing some hype cycle issues along with them not forseeing some economic and contractual issues... and sure enough within the following weeks they lost a bunch of revenue due to Trump policies and canceled the position.    \n  \nMeanwhile I'm about burned out at my current position, particularly in this current administration - but given I got into machine learning and AI back in 2015 and started investing in 2017 and my previously modest portfolio blew up to multi-millions thanks to NVDA, I've frankly been de-risking and de-prioritizing everything, moving tranches of NVDA stock to safer investments before the AI bubble deflates.  I could leave the profession and live comfortably, and I frankly think I need a break from it.  Frankly it's a bit bizarre to me to be dealing with senior agency officials who get promotions and appointments and then when something AI-related comes up, I set them straight, and they dismissively say \"oh, you know something about this\" and I lay out 10 years of applied work in the field, edge cases and they start getting uncomfortable realizing they don't know anywhere near as much as I do about it.\n\nMeanwhile I have mixed feelings, my kid followed my path into data science, started doing ML in high school with astrophysics, got a degree in data science along with minors in political science and computer science and a geospatial concentration, but the market seems so saturated, skewed and screwed right now, my kid saw that as well, so went on to grad school and is currently pursuing, of all things, a law degree despite all the hype about how AI will take over the legal profession.  BUT, who will be the humans involved, who will be steering AI ethics and digital governance, privacy rights, legislation and so on?  Certainly all that doesn't just get left to random people asking LLMs their half-baked questions.  Who is asking the bigger questions and figuring out the answers that an LLM would first need to be trained on?",

Certifications tend to be valued more than in pure data science environments (at least in Germany).\n\n- my data science work is often basic - ML has only come up once in three years (in a very minor capacity)\n\n\n**Areas I'm considering for development:**\n\n- Numeric problem-solving\n\n- Operations Research (I've started to learn but no certification yet) \n\n- Business intelligence / Analytical Operation (e.g. building better data pipelines to enable my coworkers; Snowflake want necessary yet, plus silos are a real challenge) \n\n- as a new area: possibly Supply Chain, as it seems relevant to my experience in manufacturing, chemical processes and quality support. \n\n\n**Questions for you:**\n\n1) What certifications or skills would you recommend for someone in a chemistry + data hybrid role?\n\n2) are there other areas in chemical or pharmaceutical companies where such a hybrid profile could add value?\n\n3) how can I best identify roads or projects with strong overlap between chemistry and data science? \n\n4) from a management perspective, what qualities or experiences should I build now to prepare for leadership in this space?\n\n5) any general advice on networking or positioning myself for the next step? \n\n\nI already hold a PhD, so I'm not looking for another degree - but I'm open to targeted certifications or practical learning paths.\n\nThanks in advance for your insights!\n\n(Also posted in r/chempros for additional perspectives)",

I can say it is growing however as more people realise there is a tonne of gaps in these more conservative fields, and claimed \"data scientists\", good or bad, are rushing in. \n\nWe had a self-claimed data science present at a conference this year about the marvel of Power BI. Audience lapped it up. Yes, some fields are still this far behind. The time to get in is now.\n\nIt's a good thing you're doing process optimisation / numeric problems. These are hot and will be in-demand for a while.\n\nChemistry as a whole, especially academia, will be resistant to the more fun ML projects. We like white-box solutions. \n\nI wouldn't worry about certification. If anything, learn to \"properly\" code. Try to do a simple project in another language / framework that puts you out of your comfort zone. This will easily set you apart technically from other people in the field. \n\nAs a chemist, you're probably aware of a tonne of work we do that could be done by a guy off the street with at least a weeks worth of training. These are the projects you want to look out for. Portable spectrometers and miniaturised instrument are advancing rapidly. I had a project where we got to train a chemometric model to allow in-field analysis, rather than await 3 weeks for lab results. It was a heap of fun. If you want fun work, analytical chemistry where there is a time and cost saving will be where a lot of fun work will be.\n\nAs for the best soft skill to learn, it will be communication to upper management and your target audience. You'll need to be able to \"sell\" your analysis/models so to speak. Most people don't understand basic statistics, let alone chemistry. Learn to simplify and explain the cost/benefits to the layperson. This will take you far. It took me a while to break out of the rigor that academia makes you speak.",

A couple of years back Chem+DS was really sparsely populated. I'm happy that has changed. Being in a niche had a lot of advantages. It does make it difficult to find people in similar situations. So, thanks for engaging!\n\n> people realise there is a tonne of gaps in these more conservative fields\n\nI'm happy that more non-techies are realising the need for closing these gaps. Also, good to see that the in not alone with my judgement on the conservative nature.\n\n> present at a conference this year about the marvel of Power BI. Audience lapped it up.\n\nYes, that's the level. I mean, at the end of the day I want to create value with data. If it's PowerBI, then it's PowerBI. SharePoint, lists and Power automate are another one. I'll aim at implementing a methodology and data culture - a bigger picture rather than just a solution to a problem. In the end, it's where the value lies for my colleagues. So, I'll be tool-agnostic.\n\n> It's a good thing you're doing process optimisation / numeric problems. These are hot and will be in-demand for a while.\n\nCheers, this makes me feel validated.\n\n> Chemistry as a whole, especially academia, will be resistant to the more fun ML projects. \n\nThe issues I see are:\n\n- implementation (too many silos)\n- oftentimes relatively small datasets compared to the number of variables \n\nML didn't make a lot of sense in many of the cases I've seen. So, it's a specialised tool unless and until the data maturity will have increased.\n\n> We like white-box solutions.\n\nI've never heard that term before. Is that like a ready-made solution - or is it about transparent solutions?\n\n> If you want fun work, analytical chemistry where there is a time and cost saving will be where a lot of fun work will be.\n\nI didn't have this on my list.

You'll need to be able to \"sell\" your analysis/models so to speak. \n\nValuable advice, thanks! I've had more exposure to higher management. They operate on a different level altogether and tend to trust their people about the technical minutia. 😄\n\nAnd yes. Story telling is so so important. I pride myself in being able to make presentations that are accessible to everyone. That's something I've got on my to-do list for the next year actually.",

There’s Citrine Informatics, Alchemy Cloud, Albert Invent, NobleAI, alcemy, Uncountable, Potion AI, Turing Labs, FutureHouse/Edison Scientific and others. You could consider solutions engineering roles which require a mix of technical and interpersonal work. \n\nThere are certainly roles across the industry that value a hybrid Chem/DS skill sets. You might find them within teams labeled as “data science”, “cheminfomatics”, “digitalization”, or elsewhere. Some such roles will exist in supply chain and OR teams as well, though you likely won’t dive as deep into your chemistry domain knowledge there. Some teams work with a lot of siloed and non-interoperable data and don’t even know they need a “data person” yet. \n\nOverall, the industry is adopting AI/ML relatively slowly due to its conservatism. Chemical and materials manufacturers will adopt AI/ML more broadly, but it will take time. This means that the sort of opportunities you’re looking for are available and will grow over time, but they’ll grow slowly (like most things in the industry).\n\nAs for what to focus on, I’d recommend prioritizing projects that you can connect to your company’s bottom line. If it saves cost that’s good; if it increases revenue that’s even better.",

Understand the main principle. Only then go to the medium tasks. Do not even touch the hard ones - you do not need it. The interviewera mostly check the way of your thinking - it is good if you can explain not only why the solution is working but it is optimal. Knowing O(n) notation is must have",

Explain your approach clearly even if you need to look something up.\n\nFor the generic coding round, I would bias toward clarity over cleverness. Simple data structures, clean logic, and talking through tradeoffs tends to matter more than squeezing out optimal complexity in 30 minutes. Interviewers often care less about finishing than about how you reason.\n\nThe uncertainty is annoying, but most companies reuse pretty standard problems.

The market is incredibly bad for juniors, and I had the benefit of making the switch from academia during the Obama administration (and have switched once again to more writing libraries for other data scientists in an SWE capacity). IME recruiters are mostly... *doing their own thing* so there is a separate conversation about tailoring your resume and skills to their tastes. So take the following with a grain of salt.\n\nIn terms of what I personally like to see, I'd recommend picking up Python, SQL and if you want to be extra spicy the basics of git.\n\nI've interviewed tons of people for junior DS roles and I have a strong preference for people coming out of hard/social sciences (or frankly, 12th century French Literature) than dedicated DS master's programs. My hot take is that the \"Data Science\" degree appears to prepare people for working as a data scientist about as much as a compsci undergraduate degree prepares people to be software engineers.\n\nIn general, without prior industry experience neither researchers from other disciplines nor the people with data science degrees tend to walk in the door with the skills they need to do the day to day job. But, while the data science degrees apparently focus on the mechanical techniques of the job (which then have to be discarded), science background folks tend to at least be taught the fundamentals underpinning methodologies and good data hygiene which are relevant in a roundabout way and make it easier to succeed. I don't feel like it's the level (PhD vs MA) inasmuch as the point of the data scientist's job is to have good critical thinking skills (i.e. to figure out the real question being asked and how to pick from the big toolbox of tools to answer it best). So, that DS masters, to me anyway, is just signalling. And maybe that's fine, and maybe that is what gets you the job. But I have to actively fight against my own internal biases when a resume is given to me to evaluate with a data science master's on it.\n\nIt's worth noting that my opinion *does* actually matter, but I only screen resumes *after* the recruiter gets to look at them and so I'm more of a veto-ing member of the process.",

Since you’ve interviewed a lot of junior candidates, I'd love to pick your brain on this.\n\nWhen you say “pick up SQL”, what level do you expect from applicants at the interview stage? For example, is it enough to write SELECT/JOIN/WHERE queries, or do you expect comfort with window functions, CTEs, performance issues, etc.?\n\nIt would help to know what good enough looks like for you when hiring juniors, and what mistakes make you reject people immediately. Would you say syntax fluency is essential or do you prioritize understanding and reasoning. Of course both are necessary I get that.",

                  "text": "For a data scientist \"good enough\" re SQL would probably be everything in the W3School tutorial (though they appear to be missing CTE/with, so yeah chuck that in). Performance and SQL is not like Big O (or doing performance optimization in the real world, if you want to see what that looks like I'd recommend sticking through as much of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCY7p6dVAGE) as you can given it's about Rust but that's pretty much what it's like) so I wouldn't care beyond I guess if I saw something off perf wise I might ask for you to speculate about why it might be a problem (and I'd care more about your logicing through it than being right). But I should be clear, these days I work as a pure SWE and I generally test DS in roles that only require basic SQL and look for an imperative language alongside them (this will be Python by far in terms of popularity).\n\nI have low expectations for juniors in terms of programming skill, frankly. After all, most computer science graduates suck at doing \"real world\" programming so why should I expect a biology PhD to be good at it? I select for thoughtfulness, an indication that the candidate actually cares about writing high quality, readable stuff (even if they're not there yet), has a level of comfort with their chosen tools. It's not impressive to me if you can do every trick in the DS&A bag in Python perfectly if when I ask you to make a small change you clearly memorized the trick rather than made an effort to understand.\n\n> Would you say syntax fluency is essential or do you prioritize understanding and reasoning\n\nThe first comes from the latter, if genuine \"fluency\" is the measure. If the person interviewing you has a clue how to proctor a technical properly, the initial question is only for checking you can mechanically do a relevant task. The value is in the questions we get to ask you about your understanding, and one of the ways I poke at that is I will ask you to change it.\n\nAs a concrete example, let's say I ask you to do a task where the order of names is important, so the trick is you need to know to sort. Let's say your data is `Last name, First name, M.`. I might ask you to change which name you're sorting by, which would likely require you to do some manipulation of the data. You need to understand and reason about sorting and figure out how you get from `sorted(list_of_names)` to the same thing but by first name (to which end there are several reasonable paths).\n\nSomeone with drive and the basics can be taught any programming they need. I have taught social science graduates production level C++, the good ones turn into good programmers way faster than they thought they would (I've heard more than once \"that's too hard for me\" which is always wrong. I have heard a couple of \"that's trivial\" and they ended up a bit differently lmao).\n\n> what mistakes make you reject people immediately\n\nAutomatic rejections? That's a high bar. Mostly indications you're going to be a bad teammate. If you use slurs (or frankly other suspicious language that makes me think you're an HR risk) or are dismissive of non-technical people, if you think you're too good for dirty work like data munging, if when I try and help you through the questions you are resistant to guidance (I write questions with the goal of the first part being gentle and the second being at what I'd expect someone at the next level to be able to do without assistance so I can effectively judge pairing with the person [yes this comes with a statement in the interview the next part will be challenging and I'm there to help]). So, basically, arrogance and nastiness.\n\nThings that will count against you are considerably more numerous and range from totally innocuous (e.g. I will need to teach you how to name variables) to not dealbreakers but you better have something else working for you (bad statistics fundamentals, \"I'd solve it with ChatGPT\", talking uncritically about delivering shareholder value or \"business impact\", etc).\n\nNothing gets more positive marks from me than a general demonstration that you're a thoughtful, empathetic human being who is enthusiastic about improving their craft and ready to be a teammate working towards a common team goal. Oh, and your team is your fellow ICs, not the whims of management or as they love to call themselves \"leadership\". This is the stuff that all genuinely great DS and SWE are made of (and yes I am taking a shot at all the grumpy SWE in very high positions who are good programmers but miserable to work with). If I see that, and your technical skills clear the bar, I will advocate for you even against nominally slightly more \"qualified\" people who seem like they have too many sharp edges. Which may be slightly hypocritical (I am the king of the yappers and very opinionated so some [maybe even many?] people find me taxing). Oh, and if you're going to not bring one of those (empathy, self improvement mindset), I suggest it be the second. If you are happy where you are skillwise, I can still find a use for you. If you give me the vibe I'm going to regret letting you through because I might get stuck with you... well that isn't going to work in your favor. Though I have been overruled before :shrug:",

Unless you have experience on the business side, it's going to be your weakest area and your PhD is not going to transfer well. I would focus on anything related to microbiology. You could work on some type of \"operations research\" for biological materials that wet labs use, for instance. Anything that involves microbiology, even if tangentially, is going to be better. You need to figure out what type of technical skills those positions need to prepare for interviews or anything 'extra' you need to learn.

          "text": "I got into data science without a degree at all (not even an undergrad).\n\nMost companies want someone that knows SQL and Tableau/Power Bi really well for analytics and you can pick both up on udemy or coursera. This will get you into data analysis which is much more important to a company than ai/ml. After I did that, I picked up python and got exceptional at it (again available on udemy). \n\nNow however, I realized I hit a wall and eventually got my undergrad in data sceince (computer science might even be slightly better) and a masters in data science from uc berkeley. Not having these significantly limits your ability to do machine learning because you wont be exposed to graduate level statistics. Learning stats at this level gives you thr language and concepts needed to know whats going on under the hood of algorithms and when it comes time to deploy ai/ml youll have a lot better time fine tuning your models. Infact thr word model comes from stats.\n\nAlso I would occasionally get interviews with my undergrad degree, but once I had berkeley on my resume then the call backs I recieved went up exponentially. Not sure if its because its berkeley and their reputation or if its simply just the fact I have a masters but either way it was worth it for me.\n\nGiven that youre already in a strong stem degree though, you likely have the stats background. You need to focus on sql/Tableau and then python. R is great for running tests and creating stats models but in industry this is not what you will be doing and python will give you the power to solve all the other problems that R struggles with, but youll have both at your disposal.",
