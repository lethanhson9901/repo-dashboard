An (internal) consulting service recently made a POC using LLM and achieved high score on test set. I'm tasked to refine and implement the solution into our current offering.\n\nUpon opening the notebook, I realized this so called LLM solution is actually extreme prompt engineering using chatgpt, with a huge essay containing excruciating details on what to look for and what not to look for.\n\nI was immediately turned off by it. A typical \"interesting\" solution in my mind would be something like looking at demographics, cormobidity conditions, other supporting data (such as lab, prescriptions...et.c). For text cleaning and extracting relevant information, it'd be something like training NER or even tweaking a BERT.\n\nThis consulting solution aimed to achieve the above simply by asking.\n\nWhen asked about the traditional approach, management specifically requires the use of LLM, particular the prompt type, so we can claim using AI in front of even higher up (who are of course not technical).\n\nAt the end of the day, a solution is a solution and I get the need to sell to higher up. However, I found myself extremely unmotivated working on prompt manipulation. Forcing a particular solution is also in direct contradiction to my training (you used to hear a lot about Occam's razor).\n\nIs this now what's required for that biweekly paycheck? That I'm to suppress intellectual curiosity and more rigorous approach to problem solving in favor of calming to be using AI? Is my career in data science finally coming to an end? I'm just having existential crisis here and perhaps in denial of the reality I'm facing.",

Nowadays, it feels like all of my pitches to clients are about answering a request for \"AI\", include a scoping phase where more often than not I try to get them to understand that gen ai isn't the solution (and bring down unrealistic expectations) but ML/stats modelling is better suited for the business case, and then flipping a coin on whether or not they accept while I'm clenching.\n\nThough truth is even on ml projects I've had to do much more software engineering and DevOps for some years now. Clients don't want PoC or pure models anymore, they want a full on prod-ready MVP they can deploy to pilots right from the get go so you can't afford to develop the model and pawn it off to data engineers anymore. My last two ml projects, i spent more time working on how to deploy, SE design patterns, ci/cd, env integration and deployment strategies, value tracking... than actual ml. The only place nowadays where you get to avoid this are r&d ml engineers jobs, but from what I saw those tend to lack the use cases rotations and contact with business I like.",

Interviewers are always looking for different things, so it's hard to predict, but a few points on things some people, or most people, tend to screw up on.\n\nFirst, do the most basic level of research on the company you are interviewing for.  Know their products, understand their strengths and weaknesses, their various business models, who their main competitors are, and their philosophy if they talk about it on their website, etc.  Almost no one we interview does this, and it shows.\n\nSecond, a Senior DS should be able to walk me through any project, no matter how old, that you say you've worked on in your resume.  All the standard STAR tactics for every project, but also senior levels should be able to walk me through why for each step, plus think of good answers for \"why didn't you do it this way\", plus in what ways your senior level experience has changed how you would approach each project today.  Lastly, if you can't remember a step or decision you made 5+ years ago on a project, just make a reasonable one up and have it ready to go.  Never say \"I don't know, I can't remember.\"\n\nThird, this can be tricky, but while you should of course be serious during the interview, also kind of try to match their personality/vibe.  Getting people to think, \"this is the kind of person I would want to sit next to everyday while I work\" has a lot more power than you would think.\n\nLastly, LEARN FROM YOUR FAILED INTERVIEWS.  Every question you were a little weak on or got wrong, do a deep dive into that topic (plus related topics) after your interview, so you'll never get tripped up on the same topic twice.",

      "text": "From what I'm starting to see in the job market, it seems to me that the demand for \"traditional\" data science or machine learning roles seem be decreasing and shifting towards these new LLM-adjacent roles like AI/ML engineers. I think the main caveat to this assumption are DS roles that require strong domain knowledge to begin with and are more so looking to add data science best practices and problem framing to a team (think fields like finance or life sciences). Honestly it's not hard to see why as someone with strong domain knowledge and basic statistics can now build reasonable predictive models and run an analysis by querying an LLM for the code, check their assumptions with it, run tests and evals, etc. \n\nHaving said that, I'm curious what the subs advice would be for new grads (or early career DS) who graduated around the time of the ChatGPT genesis to maximize their chance of breaking into data? Assume these new grads are bootcamp graduates or did a Bachelors/Masters in a generic data science program (analysis in a notebook, model development, feature engineering, etc) without much prior experience related to statistics or programming. Asking new DS to pivot and target these roles just doesn't seem feasible because a lot of the time the requirements are often a strong software engineering background as a bare minimum.\n\nGiven the field itself is rapidly shifting with the advances in AI we're seeing (increased LLM capabilities, multimodality, agents, etc), what would be your advice for new grads to break into data/AI? Did this cohort of new grads get rug-pulled? Or is there still a play here for them to upskill in other areas like data/analytics engineering to increase their chances of success?",

This was happening before LLMs took off and the current AI cycle just accelerated it. The writing was on the wall already for data analytics work.\n\nThe advice for new grads is still kind of the same as it was when the labor market got saturated around COVID, show people what you can build. No one cares about Titanic dataset tutorials or a portfolio of Jupyter notebooks with 30 pages of “report”. People want to see a unique insight on novel data, a project that conveys a sense of architecture, or some job experience that goes beyond homework. New grads and soon to be grads should be hammering every internship possible and working on projects that aren’t just resume padding. ",

Although part of the reason why I mentioned that ML engineering is inaccessible to new grads is that (and correct me if I'm wrong) it's still rather difficult to say deploy an ML model within a app. So I'm curious what you would advise junior folks to build in order to stand out more in the job market and showcase it in their applications? To me, the projects that come to mind are jupyter books or data pipelines that feed into a web app but I'm curious if you have other suggestions that are accessible for new grads? \n\nAnd another challenge I think is how to market your work once you have a project going. Of course you can hype up your project on LinkedIn but I think part of the difficulty with this is that hiring managers aren't often looking through your GitHub or portfolio website (happy to be corrected in this as well).",

The goal was to grow customers via core features. On platform reporting was barebones so you needed a dedicated person or teams on the customer’s end to do analytical work and create dashboards.\n\nOnce most of the core features got built the lower priority things on the product roadmap like better dashboards and integrations got worked on. In previous years you’d want a data analyst to do some work on that csv data. That has increasingly been automated at the request of customers which means the need for analysts has shrunk over time. Those titles stayed around, but that was mostly because of responsibility creep. \n\nIt’s kind of similar to when Excel first came around.

Instead of targeting the old notebook focused data scientist role, focus on strong SQL, data modeling, basic software engineering practices, cloud fundamentals, and the ability to deploy and monitor simple pipelines. Pair that with either domain expertise in industries like finance or healthcare or practical LLM application skills such as building RAG systems, designing evaluations, and tracking cost and performance. Use platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, dbt, StrataScratch, and AWS to build data skills, and tools like OpenAI, Hugging Face, LangChain, and Pinecone to experiment with AI applications. If you position yourself as someone who can turn messy data into reliable assets and deliver AI enabled features end to end, you can stay competitive even without a deep ML engineering background.",

The LLM wave has accelerated something that was already quietly happening. DS has always sat in an awkward middle ground, technical but we're not engineers, business-facing but without the visibility of other functions to go up the chain.\n\nMy honest advice for new grads: if hardcore engineering isn't your thing, lean into what LLMs can't easily replicate: stakeholder management, problem framing, translating ambiguous business questions into something tractable. The PM-adjacent path in AI products will need people who are technically literate but also genuinely good with people. That will be a gap down the line. If you enjoy the algorithm development, then lean into AI engineering roles.\n\nThe ceiling in large DS orgs was always real. The difference now is the timeline has compressed: so being intentional about which direction you grow early matters more than it used to.",

I think it's more of an excuse being used because it looks cool for investors; in the meantime, hiring in India has been going up so many roles were replaced. \n\nI think your presentation might give them an incorrect understand of all of the roles there are. I think a lot of the work you might present is moving to MLE which, not only is not a first job, it requires SWE skills. \n\nI disagree with telling them to focus on \"advanced skills such as building an end-to-end system\". I think that: \n\n(1) There are many types of roles (DA, DS, MLE), areas out there (Product, Growth, Go to Market), industries (tech, finance, healthcare, etc.) They need to find what's the best fit for them. \n\n(2) Many of the \"advanced skills\" roles are being taken by SWE. Also, I've been interviewing a lot and companies that ask about anything for deploying models, etc., are start-ups. They also have take homes and if you move beyond that, like bigger companies, they call the role MLE. These roles are very difficult to get and they require a lot of prep for system design interviews. I wouldn't recommend this for people who are finishing a masters in DS unless they come from SWE. \n\nThat said, yes, having skills helps get you to the door, but even in full stack DS interviews they are going to ask you fro basic python/SQL coding interview, product sense, etc. in interviews. So spending hours and hours on a project and investing in the skills you mentioned is kind of a waste. They should be preparing for interviews first and if they have no business or product sense, they are not going to pass any interview screening.\n\nMy advice would (1), to find what they are a good fit for and have a coherent resume. Not sell themselves as someone who can do everything and anything. \n\n",

Legally only a human can be responsible for the output at the moment.\n\nI still see plenty of jobs for people who understands and can descibe what they want. Humans still needs to give context and have a vision of the output.\n\nSo less focus on coding but still relevant to have the right background/experiance.\n\nMy background is in Chemical engineering and now I work with a mix of data analysis/science and change management.

You could talk about how feature stores help keep data consistent between training and real time inference. That is a huge pain point in the industry that students rarely see in class. Explaining the architectural side of things will give them a massive leg up when they start interviewing for junior roles.\n\nI actually write about these engineering and architectural challenges in my newsletter at machinelearningatscale.substack.com.

The answer was always \"yes\" because we live in an online world and undertstanding data is the only way to navigate it. Data are difficult to interpret and so you will need people who can do that.\n\n10 years ago, if you could fit a model then that was enough to enter the field, that's still valued, but there are other skills like being able to select metrics, diagnose dashboard changes, set up experiments, influence roadmaps with recommendations over what to build next and so on.\n\nThere's a bunch of research that says that AI is having an impact, but there are other economic factors at play as well. It's never easy to start your career and it's definitely more challenging than ever but there's also more information and strategy to do so than ever as well.\n\nYes, it's worth being anxious about, but the solution to anxiety is being able to create a strategy strong enough to get you through the challenges ahead. If you're in a position where you're asking someone else \"will it be okay\" then the problem is that you're not thinking for yourself yet, which is what's most important in the first place.",

Usually the Q&A part will be a lot of questions about the job market.\n\nI'm always honest with them, but I don't want to be all doom and gloom. I let them know that the job market is very competitive, but I pair that with advice - encourage them to spend time networking, to go to local industry events, do something other than go to class (lead a student group, do research with your prof, etc). They love my slide with all of the different job titles and search terms because all they really know is \"data scientist\" or \"data analyst\".\n\nI also stress that this field is always evolving. It's changed in the 10 years since I started working in data, it's changed in the past 3 years since the job market turned around, and it's changed in the past 2 years since AI started booming. And it's going to keep changing in ways that I probably won't expect. New jobs will pop up - in the past few years, we've gotten Analytics Engineer, DevOps, and Data Science is more specialized into inference/experimentation, ML research, ML Eng, ML Ops, etc. Heck Data Science didn't even exist when I started my career 20+ years ago. So who knows what jobs will become available.\n\nSo you have to expect for any career that things are going to change and you'll have to keep adapting. Analytics/DS is my second career, I spent the first 10 years in marketing, and even that went through a lot of changes - the people who were adaptable survived, and the people who wanted to keep \"doing things the way I've always done them\" didn't.

I would rather understand what do the features represent, could they potentially be predictive, etc. Even if a feature is missing in 99% of samples, there could be 1% of samples where it is extremely predictive.\n\n2. I don't understand why you added an indicator for missing values if you are using xgboost models that can natively handle missing values.\n\n3. I don't generally agree with the practice of \"capping outliers\" or filtering outliers, etc. Outliers are not necessarily bad and should not necessarily be treated any differently. The only exceptions in my opinion is if I understand the domain and I know the outliers are caused by a genuine measurement error. \n\n4. Overall, I feel like this type of exercise is fairly useless. It sounds like you went through a very basic generic EDA process, however it doesn't seem to take anything into account regarding the domain/problem/business value, etc.\n\nIf I am asking an interviewee about a problem like this, I am more interested in having them ask questions like:\n\n- What business problem are we solving?\n\n- Are we collecting the data properly for the problem we want to solve?\n\n- What loss functions / evaluation metrics should we use?\n\n- How will the model be used/deployed? Is it properly formulated?\n\n- How should we split the data in train/valid/test?\n\n\nTo me, those are the actual important skills and questions that should be addressed. But walking through some generic EDA process is kind of pointless in my opinion, but I don't really know much about the interview questions and process you went through.",

Extreme values may be rare, but they can reflect the true underlying population rather than errors. In the example you mention, heavy tails are expected. You shouldn't just delete data to make your model \"fit better\".

Simple models often perform just as well. To me we always need a justified reason for jumping to more complicated less interpretable models.

Subsample the entire dataset (not just one class)\n\n2. Use a model that can support training from disk. For example neural networks are very easy to train any dataset size due to batch loading. I think there are also some implementations for other models to support similar as well.\n\n\nOne other possible option is to undersample one class, but weight it higher in the loss to counter the undersampling. But I would treat this as a hyperparameter and see if it even performs any better than just subsampling the entire dataset.",

I was logged into LinkedIn while scraping, so these are not just promoted posts.\n\nMy search keywords were mainly data scientist and data analyst, but a lot of other roles show up under those searches, so that’s why the results include other job families too.\n\nI capped scraping at 18 pages per site (LinkedIn + SimplyHired), because after that the titles get even less relevant.\n\nTotal unique active positions: **617**\n\nBreakdown of main relevant categories:\n\n* Data analyst related: **233**\n* Data scientist related: **124**\n* Machine learning engineer related: **58**\n* Business intelligence specialist: **41**\n* Data engineer: **37**\n* Data science / ML researcher: **33**\n* Analytics engineer: **11**\n* Data associate: **9**\n\nOther titles were hard to categorize: GenAI consultants, biostatistician, stats & analytics software engineer, software engineer (ML), pricing analytics architect, etc.\n\nMy scraper is obviously not perfect. Some roles were likely missed. Some might be on Indeed or Glassdoor and not show up on LinkedIn or SimplyHired, although in my experience most roles get cross-posted. So let's take the 600 and double it. That’s \\~1,200 active DS / ML / DA related roles in the GTA.\n\nShort-term contracts usually don’t get posted like this. Recruiters reach out directly. So let’s add another 500 active short-term contracts floating around. We still end up with less than 2K active positions.\n\nI assume there are thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people right now applying for DS / ML roles here. That ratio alone explains why even getting an interview feels hard.\n\nFor context, companies that had noticeably more active roles in my list included: Allstate, Amazon Development Centre Canada ULC, Atlantis IT Group, Aviva, Canadian Tire Corporation, Capital One, CPP Investments, Deloitte, EvenUp, Keystone Recruitment, Lyft, most banks - TD, RBC, BMO, Scotia, StackAdapt, Rakuten Kobo.\n\nThere are a lot of other companies in my list, but most have only one active DS related position.",

Many people over index on advanced models when most real work is messy data and decision support.\n\nA good progression is:\n\n* statistics + SQL + Python fundamentals\n* exploratory analysis and visualization\n* classical ML (regression, trees, validation)\n* one or two end to end portfolio projects with clear business questions\n\nHiring tends to reward evidence that you can take ambiguous data and produce actionable insight more than knowledge of specific algorithms.",

You can use AI to ask why everything was done the way it is.

While average housing cost might seem higher in the major Canadian cities, what you have to understand is that Canadians have much higher standards of living than European.\n\nIn Europe, it is very common to live in a 300 sqft studio when you are living alone, in Canada people consider this as precarious living. And let's not forget about the amenities, gym, swiming pool, sauna, theater ? That's very common in canadian condos, that's unheard of in Europe.\n\nI (6 YoE data scientist) used to make top 10% DS salary in Paris (85k€), I now make barely top 50% DS salary in Toronto (140k CAD), but I save so much more here in Toronto than in Paris. Taxes on wages and investment are lower.\n\nSeriously, for relatively **high paying job**, Canada is far better than Europe. Of course if you make minimum wage, it's better to be in Western Europe than Canada.\n\nAlso, Canadians love house ownership. Every late-20, early-30 are all about that. Those who are owner have bragging rights, the others complain about not being able to afford a family house on a single salary before even reaching 30 years old. They see renting as a shameful thing to pay for.",

Honestly, salaries outside the US for early level roles are gonna vary a lot by country and city, but for Canada, UK, and Germany, you're probably looking at a range that converts roughly to $70k $110k USD for 2 3 years of experience, though top tier companies might push a bit higher. Definitely worth checking local job boards for more precise figures; sometimes, keeping track of application statuses can get a bit messy with different systems, so having a centralized dashboard is super handy.

      "text": "See original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r1qo10/comment/o4tynuu/?context=3)\n\nI really appreciate the advice from the original thread. I discovered I was being too kind. The approaches I described were worth trying in good faith but it was enabling the negative behavior I was attempting to combat. I had to accept this was not a coaching problem. Thanks to the folks who responded and called this out.\n\nI scheduled system review meetings with VP/Director-level stakeholders from both the business and technical side. For each system I wrote a document enumerating my concerns alongside a log of  prior conversations I'd had with the team on the subject describing what was raised and what was ignored. Then I asked the team to walk through and defend their design decisions in that room. It was catastrophic. It became clear to others that the services were poorly built and the scientists fundamentally misunderstood the business problems they were trying to solve.  \n  \nThat made the path forward straightforward. The hardest personalities were let go. These were personalities who refused to acknowledge fault and decided to blame their engineering and business partners when the problems were laid bare.   \n  \nAnyone remaining from the previous org has been downleveled and needs to earn the right to lead projects again. The one service with genuine positive ROI survived. In the past, that team transitioned as software engineers under a new manager specifically to create distance from the existing dysfunction. Some of the scientists who left are now asking to return which is positive signal that this was the right move.",

I can handle that pretty easily, and at that point it would be a function of probably getting more money and a more intersting job, but not a huge hurdle.\n\nIf you need me there from 8-5pm even one day a week, then you're going to need to pay me a lot more money. Like, enough money that my wife doesn't give a shit about the fact that on those days she's going to need to do pretty much everything other than baby dropoff and pickup. ",

Every role before the pandemic was 100% in office, and every role since has been hybrid 2-3x per week in office. Some companies have been more flexible on hybrid and I was mostly remote but would go in maybe once a quarter.\n\nI live in a major city, close to the business district, so commuting to an office is pretty easy for me. I also like having a separation of work and home, although I like the option to WFH when I need to.\n\nBased on my last job search, remote roles are way more competitive. I don't live in a tech hub, so when I do find a role that I qualify for, I have less competition. Versus for a remote role, they can find who knows how many candidates as qualified or more than I am.",

It tracks data on two landing page variations, treatment and control, with mean conversion rate as the defining metric.\n\nIn my analysis, I used an alpha of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and a practical significance level of 2%, meaning the conversion rate must see at least a 2% lift to justify the costs of implementation. The statistical methods I used were as follows:\n\n1. Two-proportions z-test\n2. Confidence interval\n3. Sign test\n4. Permutation test\n\nSee the results [here](https://oineaoifnaeofineqpinafasfaefeafefaefqw.com/). Thanks for any thoughts on inference and clarity.",

The math works out about the same. \n\nThe other two tests… I don’t get why you’d do them. Run one test. Never run multiple. You need a bonferroni correction for experiment-wise error… but if it’s the same response you get no benefit, real or perceived, from testing the same thing multiple times with different tests. Also, they’re non-parametric. If your data are binomially distributed with sufficient N, then you don’t want to run those tests. \n\nInstead of learning how to run tests and saying “roast me,” learn all the theory around statistical testing. If you can understand those concepts you’ll pass more interviews and be a better data scientist.",

Any recommendations to learn AB testing fundamentals?\n\nNoted on CI and two proportions z test. That’s coming up in the text book.\n\nRe: running multiple tests — I hear what you’re saying about redundant tests. However, in dummy datasets, I have come across situations where multiple tests are useful; specifically, the sign test with a CI, in a situation where the CI points to an increase (though not statistically significant) and the sign test points to a decrease (though not statistically significant). \n\nRe: bonferroni correction, isn’t that primarily was for multiple variants? Do I need to correct when running multiple tests as well?",

We aren’t just “running a test” there are rules based on the fundamentals of the Z and T distributions.\n\nAnytime you run a test you increase the probability of an error. If you run multiple tests and don’t make a bonferroni correction, then you are making a mistake. The correction is for multiple comparisons. Every time you run a test, it’s an additional comparison. Tests should be pre-determined, otherwise you dive into this world where you’re hunting for an outcome that fits your narrative. There are mathematical proofs behind all of this - it’s not up for debate. \n\nFor you, I would start with the fundamentals of the Z and T tests. The assumptions, when to use one vs the other, and when we can’t use either. Then I’d learn ANOVA. If you can handle multivariate calc, you should understand the derivation of these tests. \n\nAfter that, running the test is really easy. It becomes understanding the business or academic problem to successfully A/B test.",
