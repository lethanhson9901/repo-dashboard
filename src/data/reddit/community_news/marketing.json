Every change needs buy-in, every experiment needs alignment, every idea needs to survive a meeting where nobody wants to be responsible if it fails. So nothing ships unless it already feels safe, which usually means it’s late or obvious. Then leadership asks why marketing isn’t “proactive,” while the system is designed to punish anyone who tries to be.",

Small mistakes happened over time which lead them to adding more and more people to the approval workflow without ever sitting back and thinking “is this really necessary?” \n\nIn my humble opinion, they SHOULD reflect on the amount of time they’re wasting on approvals. Or, if you’re not already, use a collaborative tool that makes reviewing the documents a smoother process. A specific one that comes to mind is Figma. People can leave comments in specific spots, reply to each other, tag people, etc. That functionality exists in other programs too such as the Google suite and Acrobat. \n\nThe other problem I see with this level of absurdity is not having a clear scope of the work. Now this is really quite general because things can change. People have one off conversations that they later come to believe as fact. Really the most important thing is to have a paper trail of your conversations and feedback. If it becomes such a problem that you cannot meet a deadline then it needs to be addressed. But if they’ve baked this amount of approval rounds into the timeline, well, then at least they had some sense.",

AI can help with some things - but y’all I don’t want to post the cheesy captions it makes. I don’t want to post videos where the entire thing was made by AI. It sounds so bad and I am annoyed I spent so much time for AI to do it in 3 minutes lol.

People fall in love with an instrument (emails, social media, AI, etc) and think that instrument is the solution for all problems.\n\nAI isn't the problem to me, like email wasn't the problem. I think it's been very important to find people who really know marketing. They should see that AI can't really do marketing. \n\nI've been involved with AI for almost ten years, and people on this sub were talking about things like Jasper before ChatGPT.

Orgs are forcing employees to use AI tools without training or guidance on essential things like best practices, security and compliance, contributing to a rollout of genAI tools that been a shitshow and comedy of errors. \n\nBottomline is that AI assistants (ChatGPT, Copilot) are not useful with the standard \"enter prompt, publish response\" method. How could a language processing tool know your company's (or clients') brand voice, IP, or messaging requirements? How could a freelancer deliver quality work without the same context? You need to treat it like a consultant who knows nothing about the project,  providing it the right source content, providing feedback and your expert guidance along the way with multiple interactions to refine the response. \n\nAt the very minimum, one should ground prompts on brand and legal guidelines and structured source materials. It's an easy one click document upload along with clear directions on what you need, how you expect it to be delivered, and what requirements to follow for it's delivery. If every business user did this, 99% of AI content would be more aligned to brand voice/tone/unique value. \n\nBut you shouldn't stop there - continue providing feedback, strategic guidance, share your edits and corrections to refine the output. Challenge it to cite its sources, confirm all the key benefits in the source documents are covered, fine-tune the output for specific niches, audience segments, approaches. it's just a multi-function tool that you can use as much or little as needed.",

          "text": "Job demand and opportunity has been good for me. I have a lot of generalist experience (growth management, demand generation) but focused into paid media in the last 7 years specifically.\n\nWhat I find is that companies want to hire marketers who are good at managing money in vs. money out. While all marketers may be good at this, paid search and paid display are quite literally functions of this. When set up correctly, you can generally scale any good business model up with clear, repeatable ROAS to show for it. I have held senior leadership roles during this time where my only true responsibility is managing an ad account, but one that is effectively doubling revenue for the company as a whole.\n\nHaving a generalist background is great because it allows you to collaborate more effectively across departments, work more closely with agency partners to scale out capacity, and identify areas to grow internal head count. But it’s not really a good role to be in later into you career unless you plan on freelancing. Being a jack of all trades is good, but not always desirable over specialists.\n\nThat being said, fast growth startups may want to hire generalists as their first marketing hire to test the waters. I’ve seen that a lot.\n\nMy advice to marketers is generally: take whatever first role you are offered, excel at it, and then wear as many hats as you can. Learn from others, build a broad understanding of tactics and roles, and evntually pivot to a generalist position at the midway point of your career. Use this time to identify where the money is at — not just returns, but where are businesses investing most of their capital. That’s likely paid media, but can be other areas too. That’s where you should pivot to.\n\nMarketers aren’t going away because of AI, but we are expected to do more with less. That’s not necessarily new: big data and machine learning have been a part of the job for as long as I can remember. So companies want to hire people who can effectively manage money in vs. money out to scale demand. Teams are smaller, responsibilities outsourced, but the work is definitely there for people willing to adapt. The key is to demonstrate the value of work constantly. (It is worth pointing out that AI is generally driving up costs on traditional channels, and likely will, but this is not a new trend)\n\nMy biggest concern at the moment is that marketing is demand during times of growth. Traditionally, I have been hired onto companies that need to grow sales fast and are looking to maximize output from new investments. But that period never lasts, and it can be hard to show value when leadership wants to cut costs and scale down. Marketing is an easy expenditure because it’s often viewed as a flat cost. I’ve had success testing cost effective strategies when I notice demand tapers, or operations/production begins to falter from growth in demand, so that I have an easy pivot in strategy when I’m eventually told to stop growing business and instead grow bottom line profits.\n\nA major recession would be an industry-wide challenge. That’s my longterm concern, which is why I’m currently working in a leadership role for a company that is largely recession proof. I could make more in tech or SaaS doing the same work, but I’m happy having a stable job that isn’t *as exposed* to another market downturn.",

I’m equally concerned that failing to honor the original prize could be seen as a 'scam' and cause irreversible damage to our brand's reputation in the community. Currently, my leadership remains hesitant to fulfill the $1,000 prize pool due to the low turnout and is pushing to swap the rewards for brand merchandise instead. Given this, I’d love to know: if the company insists on this 'prize downgrade,' what is the best way to handle 'damage control' with these 3 participants? Furthermore, for a growing niche brand, what are some modern, value-driven engagement tactics you'd recommend for 2026 that move beyond outdated hashtag giveaways?",

The danger is that those 3 participants are also perfectly capable of creating content to harm your brand if you execute the bait-and-switch your boss demands.\n\nMaybe you can find a compromise by deleting the contest, contact privately the 3 participants, tell them they won but kindly ask them to remove their posts because you were informed of some unfortunate legal issue and had to pull the contest. And then offer them the lowest prizes from your prize pool. That's not quite ethical but your boss gets something and your brand promoters feel valued.",

And also, people have curated feeds and may not want that kind of content to be shared coming from ‘them’. \n\nCurrently I find ‘tag a friend’ to win / share this post to enter the giveaway etc DO do really really well. People go bonkers for them even with really mundane products 😂 and everyone who’s tagged sees the post too which is more exposure. \n\n\nCan you ‘extend’ the giveaway?? Or change the formatting for it? Dependent on what’s in your T&C’s of course … \n\nIf not, you can always do a big thing about the winner? So it’s not a total flop? 😊",

Even with a strong customer base on social, people are lazy - even to share a hashtag.\n2. The prize. $1000 seems like a lot BUT it's not attention grabbing. People are bombarded with cash prizes and offers all the time.  Find a prize that will cut through the clutter and get noticed.  In a city with a hot sports team - trip to see them in another. city or some cool fan experience too. Get creative. That will stand out more than $$$ on social. \n3. We had a lot of success in daily smaller giveaways.  The prizes were smaller, but we revealed a new one every day.  The key was promoting the winners every day.  People think no one wins the big prizes. So showing them the winners helps PLUS the winners spread the word when they win. \n\nJust learn from this one and try it again but make adjustments and improve. That's the key to all marketing.

That story spreads faster than any successful campaign would have.\n\n\n\nReal talk on why it flopped:\n\n\\- Hashtag campaigns are dead. Nobody wants to post branded content for a 1-in-8 chance at money\n\n\\- $125 per winner isn't life-changing enough to overcome the \"I look like a shill\" cost\n\n\\- You probably had zero paid amplification pushing it\n\n\n\nFor the future: Instead of giveaways, run paid ads with the same $1000 budget and drive people to an email opt-in or demo. You'll get 10x better ROI and actual leads, not people who bounce after they don't win.\n\n\n\nBut right now? Honor the prizes for the 3 people.

In industry roles, I’m confident, I know I’m good at my job, and I deliver strong results. But the moment I imagine taking on a client independently, the fear kicks in hard.\n\nI have pretty intense imposter syndrome, and the thought of charging someone money and potentially disappointing them is so overwhelming that I’ve actually turned down work because of it. It feels irrational, logically I know I’m capable, but emotionally it’s kind of paralyzing.\n\nHave any of you been in this position before?\nHow did you push past the fear and self-doubt?\n\nDid you ease into freelancing, or did you just bite the bullet and jump in the deep end?\nWould really appreciate hearing your experiences or advice.",

It's hard in the beginning, the imposter syndrome is really powerful and you find it almost unbelievable someone is willing to pay you just to do some work.  \n\n\nBut then you will realise that you can deliver a better service (because you control the quality) and have better clients than when you worked for someone else and there were many decisions that weren't in your control.\n\nSo I would say to ease into it. Start small if that scares you, there's no need to jump into it. I didn't had the opportunity to ease into freelancing but actually had to rely on it. And it was rough.\n\nIf you can have a support system while making the transition, that will help you focus on quality work and client relationship. I don't think there's a need to create a tough situation for you just to motivate yourself. Especially in these volatile times. \n\nYour brain is overwhelmed because you're thinking too much ahead. Start slowly, just one extra project, one client. Don't overthink it. \n\nThere are people struggling to find work nowadays, freelance or not. If you have the privilege to have both kinds, it should be taken as a gift. You are blessed, no reason to be scared.",

But honestly, now in an era full of AI tools I think that limitation just doesn’t hold true anymore.\n\nThese days I’m working in house again, but even though I have many amazing colleagues, I spend the majority of my time collaborating with AI rather than human beings. The human contact is precious and valuable, and I would not want to see that go away.  But LLMs are available 24 seven and you can have multiple tools working on different tasks at the same time.\n\nSo being a freelance consultant in 2026 is probably the time with the least amount of friction and barriers  to doing great work.",

I think the essence should be the same, and that's one of the reasons to have a good mission statement and keep it in mind. \n\nThat's true even for my personal marketing. I'm still myself regardless of the country I go, my essence is still the same.\n\nHowever, I can't ignore the market as a marketer. I don't think I'm less \"pure\" because I switched to English when I went to the US. I don't think I'm less \"pure\" because I got Winter clothes when I moved from Texas to New York. I don't think I'm less \"pure\" because I hired a local influencer who knows the local audience better. \n\nIt's the same for brands. I remember Walmart going to Brazil and trying to sell equipment for American football, for example. \n\nMaybe the most important part of marketing strategy to me is matching the company with the target audience. \n\nEven for companies like Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola is still Coca-Cola regardless of the country, the essence is still the same. But the specifics can vary depending on the country. \n\nPart of my \"dna\" as a marketer is thinking about the market, which is not the same across the globe.",

YES\n\nWhere to draw the line - this gets to the heart of the challenge and the reason why many struggle to strike the balance.\n\nIn an oversimplified pay per click world, the answer would be simple. 100% localise even if it means it looks nothing like the global brand. \n\nIn reality, a few things are at play:\n1. The global approach and the playbook has succeeded in many geographies (I hope- else, why are we even discussing this). The brand has a clear growth algorithm. The job now is to scale that algorithm across the world. The chances of success are much higher if you look at it this way, rather than starting afresh.\n\n2. Trust - global brands have trust and credibility that has been built over time. If you use the existing brand ownables (which have memory structures created), your chances of being able to benefit from the global trust and credibility are higher.\n\n3. Efficiencies of scale- with consistency, there is a lot more efficiency in product, content, campaigns, PR and a lot more.\n\nNow- while these are the reasons to leverage the global toolkit, if the toolkit isn’t adapted (cooked) for local culture, nothing moves.\n\nSo, when you ask where to draw the line - i say 2 things:\n1. The objective should be to “scale the global algorithm in your geography” and not to recreate it ground up\n2. Localise, but keep checking if the brand is starting to look / feel completely different (enough for people to not relate to the brands big equity)? If yes, you just crossed the line\n\nCheers",

However, end of 2025 in dec, I finally got one.\n\nA digital marketer for a retail store selling combat sports equipment. The business moved on from marketing agencies to an in-house role. Boxing gloves, hand wraps, muay thai shorts, shinguards etc. Last year the store made \\~$9-10 million in sales. The goal is $30 million in sales by 2030. \n\nThis being my first proper 9-5 marketing gig, I just realised im taking on the work of an entire agency all by myself (im the only hired marketer). I do everything from shopify, klaviyo, google workspace, meta ads, reporting, optimisation, strategies, and its getting overwhelming.\n\nSo I wanted to get some insight of other people who may be in a similar role to me within a similar niche/industry. Do you do the same things? How do you manage your time? What kind of strategies or content do you do for your role, and what would you suggest for mine?\n\nThanks in advance",

Even at seven almost eight figures annually in spend across all marketing efforts we've gotten it to the point where the half million in salaries can go towards more paid media, tech stack or content.\n\nOverall, I'd never have all of those tasks under one role, its doable technically but you'll be half assing lots of things, I'd ask you to game out a few scenarios outside of doing it all yourself. Whoever hired you may think it's doable but it's going to be rough to do it all yourself",

When I was coming up with the brief tho I came across a useful methodology called \"if then\" charting it's like you map every action and what currently happens and what you hope can eventually happen eg: if a dm comes into the companies insta then a slack message is triggered, someone responds... \n\nOnce you map everything out you will soon see if you have a workflow issue where things are not communicating or connected or a function issue where things actually arent happening :) good luck - you got this!",

Have you done focus group testing to back your claim why new slogan is better than old? Receives more engagement? My guess is no. So it’s just your word against the school. The school will always win out. If you aren’t prepared to show data, then get out of the way. These are educators. If anyone can appreciate data it’s them. Do the work. Get some focus groups going. Orrrrrrr….. take your ideas to the social media side for A/B testing. It’s lower risk for failure and may strengthen your argument for change on future campaigns by showing engagement/follow-through. You will at least have some preliminary data sets to review and pitch. Some slogans are evergreen. They always work. Black Friday Sales as an example. You don’t have to be unique…. People already anticipate and expect it. Put your creative talents elsewhere and save your fight for another topic. This may not be the answer you want to hear, but one you should heed. Your career will be filled with battles to plant your flag in and make a stand. Make sure it’s one you want to do this with, or if you should regroup and lose the battle to win the larger war.",

It seems most companies or agencies have a huge blind spot when it comes to picking influencers. They keep picking creators based on a premium look or a wealthy lifestyle that has literally zero overlap with the brand’s real demographic. It’s frustrating to see mass market brands being promoted by influencers whose content screams fitness and healthy lifestyle.  \n  \nLike come on, why is your cheap greasy cookie filled with chocolate being promoted by a 20 year old from beverly hills who would literally never eat it? Or why do you choose a influencer who has a healthy lifestyle like a religion to promote your liquor brands? \n\nThe thing is, i'd actually be ok with these choices if it came with spectacular results but oh boy, at best you see some mild improvements in metrics. Like, it's almost never worth it. Again, not all campaigns are like that and not all brands but this seems to happens enough for me to talk about it.",

One of the first projects I’ve been asked to work on is to develop personas for our entire marketing funnel. Can we talk about how tricky this is to do right? \n\nThere are a thousand data points (both qualitative and quantitative) that could greatly effect the outcome of the targeted persona and it almost seems like there is no really way to quantify their individual  impact beyond an educated guess. There are just too many variables to account for with a nationwide audience. I’ve done this before on a smaller scale as a marketing manager at a previous role but I think the scope of the project is making this rough. It doesn’t help that my boss got promoted out of marketing so now the only time I get with my current boss is once every 1-2 weeks since he has so many direct reports (which I totally get). \n\nAnyway, I’m ranting now. Has anyone else done this at scale and found a way to do it following a scientific method without the outcome being totally useless to creative and the rest of the marketing team? ",

I have used recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) features for the purchasing behavior with you and then demographics as all marketers love demos like age gender income and maybe something like the type of location they live in. Then I put this through a simple clustering algorithm and worked with the marketers to come up with fun names and summary reports to describe each persona and find images and products that these personas purchase for a deck. Then we tracked these cohorts over time and reported on how these personas grew or shrank or changed and also targeted each persona for retargeting and emails differently as we have the user lists in our CRM.

For a long time, we blamed low engagement on content, emails, or timing.\n\nAfter a few events, it became clear the real problem wasn’t messaging at all. It was friction. Slow check-in, confusing apps, inconsistent data, and too many tools stitched together. Attendees started the day annoyed, and no campaign could really recover from that.\n\nOnce we focused on reducing friction at the operational level, engagement numbers improved without changing our marketing strategy much.\n\nCurious if others have seen this.  \nHave you ever discovered that an engagement or ROI issue was caused by tooling or operations rather than marketing itself?",

So sponsor friendly topics are oftentimes not audience friendly topics. It's an interesting dynamic.",

I've heard good things about Community Mentions for tracking this kind of stuff across different platforms, could be worth checking out to see if your viral moments are reaching people who'd actually buy. The other piece is having systems ready before you go viral.\n\nCapture emails, have a clear CTA, make sure your site doesn't crash. The window is usualy pretty short.",
