We now have entire threads where every single commenter is a bot or a shill.\n\nLet me give an example. \n\nA user called milli_xoxxy creates the thread \"Looking for Livestorm alternatives\" in r/Marketing.\n\nThere are 13 comments from 10 different accounts. The entire thread (all 13 comments) are spam accounts faking engagement and pushing the conversation towards a service called \"Contrast\". Basically Contrast are scamming people with fake accounts and fake positive reviews.\n\nWe now have to remove the majority of posts and comments from r/Marketing as they're either spam accounts or bot accounts.\n\nWe have probably the most active moderation on Reddit, yet the subreddit is being completely overrun by fake posts and comments. If you look at other subreddits, you'll see there isn't even an attempt to remove this scam content.\n\nMost of the users on Reddit are now spammers or bots, and the Reddit admins don't care. 🤷",

If there is a substantial number of marketers and salesmen falling for this slop, then the industry has a bigger problem than a random subreddit being flooded by bots.\n\nLLMs, on the other hand? Well, they soak up these reddit threads like a paper towel. And the people behind these spam accounts know that. Their only goal is to manufacture fake conversations about their tools or services, and because most of the time \"real\" people will just skip past these fake threads at the moment they realize they're filled with bots, all that remains are these bots. And all that a LLM then sees are these \"conversations\" that remain, which to a crawler seem just as genuine as a normal, real conversation.\n\nThis is a \"hack\" that some try to use to slip their way into LLM recommendations. I don't know how effective it is, though, but judging by the sheer amount of these hacks, I'd say it's pretty effective.",

AI can help with some things - but y’all I don’t want to post the cheesy captions it makes. I don’t want to post videos where the entire thing was made by AI. It sounds so bad and I am annoyed I spent so much time for AI to do it in 3 minutes lol.

People fall in love with an instrument (emails, social media, AI, etc) and think that instrument is the solution for all problems.\n\nAI isn't the problem to me, like email wasn't the problem.

Orgs are forcing employees to use AI tools without training or guidance on essential things like best practices, security and compliance, contributing to a rollout of genAI tools that been a shitshow and comedy of errors. \n\nBottomline is that AI assistants (ChatGPT, Copilot) are not useful with the standard \"enter prompt, publish response\" method. How could a language processing tool know your company's (or clients') brand voice, IP, or messaging requirements? How could a freelancer deliver quality work without the same context? You need to treat it like a consultant who knows nothing about the project,  providing it the right source content, providing feedback and your expert guidance along the way with multiple interactions to refine the response. \n\nAt the very minimum, one should ground prompts on brand and legal guidelines and structured source materials. It's an easy one click document upload along with clear directions on what you need, how you expect it to be delivered, and what requirements to follow for it's delivery. If every business user did this, 99% of AI content would be more aligned to brand voice/tone/unique value. \n\nBut you shouldn't stop there - continue providing feedback, strategic guidance, share your edits and corrections to refine the output. Challenge it to cite its sources, confirm all the key benefits in the source documents are covered, fine-tune the output for specific niches, audience segments, approaches. it's just a multi-function tool that you can use as much or little as needed.",

We planned for 8 winners. However, the campaign flopped. Only 3 people participated. Now, my boss doesn't want to fulfill the prizes because the \"ROI isn't there\" and the participation was so low. Has anyone dealt with this?",

I’m equally concerned that failing to honor the original prize could be seen as a 'scam' and cause irreversible damage to our brand's reputation in the community. Currently, my leadership remains hesitant to fulfill the $1,000 prize pool due to the low turnout and is pushing to swap the rewards for brand merchandise instead. Given this, I’d love to know: if the company insists on this 'prize downgrade,' what is the best way to handle 'damage control' with these 3 participants? Furthermore, for a growing niche brand, what are some modern, value-driven engagement tactics you'd recommend for 2026 that move beyond outdated hashtag giveaways?",

The danger is that those 3 participants are also perfectly capable of creating content to harm your brand if you execute the bait-and-switch your boss demands.\n\nMaybe you can find a compromise by deleting the contest, contact privately the 3 participants, tell them they won but kindly ask them to remove their posts because you were informed of some unfortunate legal issue and had to pull the contest. And then offer them the lowest prizes from your prize pool. That's not quite ethical but your boss gets something and your brand promoters feel valued.",

Even if I can stop then once, it doesn't mean I'll be able to alwayss stop them, or that I want that for my career. \n\nYeah, some companies damaged their reputation and may not exist anymore. One companies almost went bankrupt and was sold. But I don't keep checking to know the details of what happened.\n\nI focus on my reputation. If the company decides to do things that risk their reputation and survival, it's their choice. But I start to think more about my reputation. Networking is very important to me. And I develop a reputation of working for shady companies, I can really damage my reputation. \n\nBrand crises are part of what I've done. But crises that are unintentional, not something almost planned like this. Damage control doesn't make much sense to me when my company is the one doing something that can cause the damage, and aware of what it's doing. \n\nYour situation feels like doing something wrong and trying to get away with it. In that case, it can be even worse next time because they've learned how to do that type of thing.",

That story spreads faster than any successful campaign would have.\n\n\n\nReal talk on why it flopped:\n\n\\- Hashtag campaigns are dead. Nobody wants to post branded content for a 1-in-8 chance at money\n\n\\- $125 per winner isn't life-changing enough to overcome the \"I look like a shill\" cost\n\n\\- You probably had zero paid amplification pushing it\n\n\n\nFor the future: Instead of giveaways, run paid ads with the same $1000 budget and drive people to an email opt-in or demo. You'll get 10x better ROI and actual leads, not people who bounce after they don't win.\n\n\n\nBut right now? Honor the prizes for the 3 people.

And also, people have curated feeds and may not want that kind of content to be shared coming from ‘them’. \n\nCurrently I find ‘tag a friend’ to win / share this post to enter the giveaway etc DO do really really well. People go bonkers for them even with really mundane products 😂 and everyone who’s tagged sees the post too which is more exposure. \n\n\nCan you ‘extend’ the giveaway?? Or change the formatting for it? Dependent on what’s in your T&C’s of course … \n\nIf not, you can always do a big thing about the winner? So it’s not a total flop? 😊",

Even with a strong customer base on social, people are lazy - even to share a hashtag.\n2. The prize. $1000 seems like a lot BUT it's not attention grabbing. People are bombarded with cash prizes and offers all the time.  Find a prize that will cut through the clutter and get noticed.  In a city with a hot sports team - trip to see them in another. city or some cool fan experience too. Get creative. That will stand out more than $$$ on social. \n3. We had a lot of success in daily smaller giveaways.  The prizes were smaller, but we revealed a new one every day.  The key was promoting the winners every day.  People think no one wins the big prizes. So showing them the winners helps PLUS the winners spread the word when they win. \n\nJust learn from this one and try it again but make adjustments and improve. That's the key to all marketing. Learn and improve.",

In industry roles, I’m confident, I know I’m good at my job, and I deliver strong results. But the moment I imagine taking on a client independently, the fear kicks in hard.\n\nI have pretty intense imposter syndrome, and the thought of charging someone money and potentially disappointing them is so overwhelming that I’ve actually turned down work because of it. It feels irrational, logically I know I’m capable, but emotionally it’s kind of paralyzing.\n\nHave any of you been in this position before?\nHow did you push past the fear and self-doubt?\n\nDid you ease into freelancing, or did you just bite the bullet and jump in the deep end?\nWould really appreciate hearing your experiences or advice.",

It's hard in the beginning, the imposter syndrome is really powerful and you find it almost unbelievable someone is willing to pay you just to do some work.  \n\n\nBut then you will realise that you can deliver a better service (because you control the quality) and have better clients than when you worked for someone else and there were many decisions that weren't in your control.\n\nSo I would say to ease into it. Start small if that scares you, there's no need to jump into it. I didn't had the opportunity to ease into freelancing but actually had to rely on it. And it was rough.\n\nIf you can have a support system while making the transition, that will help you focus on quality work and client relationship. I don't think there's a need to create a tough situation for you just to motivate yourself. Especially in these volatile times. \n\nYour brain is overwhelmed because you're thinking too much ahead. Start slowly, just one extra project, one client. Don't overthink it. \n\nThere are people struggling to find work nowadays, freelance or not. If you have the privilege to have both kinds, it should be taken as a gift. You are blessed, no reason to be scared.",

I'm not going to sugar coat it, in the beginning I would get anything that said \"yes\" and I had many crappy clients (low pay, high demand). I had a random portfolio from before but that was mostly to demonstrate I can write (this was before AI). \n\nAfter doing cheap labour and random things, at some point I realised what I liked more and started focusing on that. As I gathered more experience by being proactive and pursuing clients in those specific niches, I managed to gather the experience and portfolio to open doors. But anyone asks for a portfolio, even if you are a total beginner. So I would recommend to create a portfolio yourself, at least 4 pieces in a specific niche, if you want to get any kind of traction. \n\nWhat I can tell you 100% is that you have to create momentum for you. Portfolio website, social media, outreach... things move when you move. Never depend on only one platform.\n\nlet me know if you have any other questions!",

But honestly, now in an era full of AI tools I think that limitation just doesn’t hold true anymore.\n\nThese days I’m working in house again, but even though I have many amazing colleagues, I spend the majority of my time collaborating with AI rather than human beings. The human contact is precious and valuable, and I would not want to see that go away.  But LLMs are available 24 seven and you can have multiple tools working on different tasks at the same time.\n\nSo being a freelance consultant in 2026 is probably the time with the least amount of friction and barriers  to doing great work.",

It took a while of putting myself out there and asking for work (about a year) for consistent work to come through. 2 years later, I have a waiting list of clients and upcoming projects. \n\nPros: \n- the flexibility is nice. it’s easier if you are self motivated. It’s 11am and I haven’t started my work day yet. \n- I am respected more than I was at any of my in-house roles\n- I love not having to answer to anyone\n\n\nCons: \n- My health insurance premium in the US is $475/mo. for mediocre coverage and a high deductible.\n- My tax bill is higher. \n- no PTO. if you take time off, you don’t get paid. \n- the work waxes and wanes. When you’re busy, save money for when you’re slow. I have 1-2 consistent clients and fill the rest of my availability with contracts of 3-6 months. \n\nYou have to be smarter about managing your money. pay your quarterly taxes if in the US",

She is senior to me so I don’t feel comfortable confronting her about using AI or asking her to use it less.\n\nShould I just do what she says and put it on the website as is?\n\nThis has happened multiple times recently, with senior colleagues sending me generic AI content and expecting me to share it or put it on the site.\n\nAny tips on how to deal with this in the least awkward way possible?",

I suppose you could have a boss that gets defensive of their work, but if AI did it all, they might appreciate the extra effort.\n\nAlso, you can prompt ChatGPT to customize stuff to not come off so AI-ish. I usually get a first draft, then give detailed guidance to help shape it to be more natural or fitting the tone of the company or a natural voice.\n\nOne cool thing I do (at least I think it’s cool), is to have ChatGPT write a longer article, go back and forth to get things more natural or conversational, then ask it to break it up into 4-6 smaller, independent “segments”. That way you can get more content out of it, and can do something like a themed content week or slow drip of content that’s all related.",

If you submit that copy as is what are the long term ramifications to you and the company?\n\nIf little to none - submit it and move on. \n\nIf the impact is measurable and you deem it significant, have a genuine convo with them but make sure you choose your words very carefully. You are not trying to preach to them about chat gpt, and you want to have actual numbers to back yourself up just in case. Maybe a few case studies/data sets on AI slop vs human created copy and how it performs. Tell them you are happy to do whatever they decide is best, but you have some concerns about sending the copy as is. \n\nIt’s all important to keep it on “I” statements and not on “you” statements. Say something like “I was previously at “X company doing Y task and I was using chatGPT for all of my company because it freed up so much time for me to handle more urgent tasks, but I noticed that the performance of my campaigns dropped off significantly. What I started doing was using chatGPT to generate the content but then manually went through and revised it, not only for accuracy but also to make it feel more human. Once I did that the performance picked back up. Would you mind if I made some revisions to your copy? When I was reading through it I immediately thought of my past experience - I think if I even just sat with it for an hour I could get it to perform substantially better.” And let them speak. \nStay away from “you used ChatGPT on this whole thing and it —--“ etc\n*Note* replace experience at X with research you’ve been doing and just show them the findings, or anything else relatable. I think you catch my drift. \n\nIf they push back, how important is this to you?\n\nIf a portion of your job switched primarily to signing off on AI slop, could you live with that? My advice would be take a step back, think of what the worst possible + the most probable outcomes might be if you decide to take action or let it go. Then, balance those between the status quo and act accordingly.",

I don't think I'm less \"pure\" because I switched to English when I went to the US. I don't think I'm less \"pure\" because I got Winter clothes when I moved from Texas to New York. I don't think I'm less \"pure\" because I hired a local influencer who knows the local audience better. \n\nIt's the same for brands. I remember Walmart going to Brazil and trying to sell equipment for American football, for example. \n\nMaybe the most important part of marketing strategy to me is matching the company with the target audience. \n\nEven for companies like Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola is still Coca-Cola regardless of the country, the essence is still the same. But the specifics can vary depending on the country. \n\nPart of my \"dna\" as a marketer is thinking about the market, which is not the same across the globe.",

YES\n\nWhere to draw the line - this gets to the heart of the challenge and the reason why many struggle to strike the balance.\n\nIn an oversimplified pay per click world, the answer would be simple. 100% localise even if it means it looks nothing like the global brand. \n\nIn reality, a few things are at play:\n1. The global approach and the playbook has succeeded in many geographies (I hope- else, why are we even discussing this). The brand has a clear growth algorithm. The job now is to scale that algorithm across the world. The chances of success are much higher if you look at it this way, rather than starting afresh.\n\n2. Trust - global brands have trust and credibility that has been built over time. If you use the existing brand ownables (which have memory structures created), your chances of being able to benefit from the global trust and credibility are higher.\n\n3. Efficiencies of scale- with consistency, there is a lot more efficiency in product, content, campaigns, PR and a lot more.\n\nNow- while these are the reasons to leverage the global toolkit, if the toolkit isn’t adapted (cooked) for local culture, nothing moves.\n\nSo, when you ask where to draw the line - i say 2 things:\n1. The objective should be to “scale the global algorithm in your geography” and not to recreate it ground up\n2. Localise, but keep checking if the brand is starting to look / feel completely different (enough for people to not relate to the brands big equity)? If yes, you just crossed the line\n\nCheers",

How do you know it’s working?\n\n**2) What are you measuring instead of leads?**  \nSome ideas I’ve been circling (but haven’t seen formalised well):\n\n* Quality of first sales conversations (e.g. “I don’t know what I’m looking for” vs “I know what you do, please help me solve *this* problem”)\n* Less wastage upstream (fewer junk enquiries rather than more MQLs)\n* Shorter time to meaningful conversations\n* Better alignment between sales narrative and buyer expectations\n\n**3) How are you explaining this to leadership?**  \nNot dashboards for the sake of it — but *what evidence* convinces people that demand is being built even if attribution is messy or incomplete?\n\nThis feels like a fundamentals problem, not a tooling one.  \nWe’re changing where and how demand is created, but still trying to measure it with the same old instruments.\n\nIf you’ve found signals that actually work (or you’re still wrestling with it...)

      "text": "So I was hired as a marketing manger for a higher ed group in a fast growing private university. One of the first projects I’ve been asked to work on is to develop personas for our entire marketing funnel. Can we talk about how tricky this is to do right? \n\nThere are a thousand data points (both qualitative and quantitative) that could greatly effect the outcome of the targeted persona and it almost seems like there is no really way to quantify their individual  impact beyond an educated guess. There are just too many variables to account for with a nationwide audience. I’ve done this before on a smaller scale as a marketing manager at a previous role but I think the scope of the project is making this rough. It doesn’t help that my boss got promoted out of marketing so now the only time I get with my current boss is once every 1-2 weeks since he has so many direct reports (which I totally get). \n\nAnyway, I’m ranting now. Has anyone else done this at scale and found a way to do it following a scientific method without the outcome being totally useless to creative and the rest of the marketing team? ",

I have used recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) features for the purchasing behavior with you and then demographics as all marketers love demos like age gender income and maybe something like the type of location they live in. Then I put this through a simple clustering algorithm and worked with the marketers to come up with fun names and summary reports to describe each persona and find images and products that these personas purchase for a deck. Then we tracked these cohorts over time and reported on how these personas grew or shrank or changed and also targeted each persona for retargeting and emails differently as we have the user lists in our CRM.

          "text": "First, pivoting out of marketing would be very different from pivoting out of demand generation to me.\n\nMy opinion about the current situation of demand generation is quite negative, so that's not something for me, and I'd see much more reason to pivot out of it. Not because of lack of stability, but because too many people in demand generation don't seem to know what they are doing. \n\nIn your case, if you position yourself well, if you network properly, it seems project management would be a possibility. But it's more about using your experience and developing relationshios than relying on certifications.\n\nNow, for marketing instead of demand generation, I never saw any reason to pivot out of marketing. I could change a lot but still in marketing. Work with the finance-marketing interface. Work with marketing consulting. Work with entertainment marketing. Work with international marketing. Work with data analytics in marketing. Work in academia. Work with new product development. Marketing is so big that can include almost anything, I've seen people from tons of fields in marketing. I've had been in events related to cyber security, for example, and I probably could do something like that in marketing if I wanted to.\n\nAbout stable fields. If I wanted something more stable, probably I'd go back to Finance. But I see no reason to move back to that. Finance tends to be more stable, but it doesn't give the wide range of opportunities that I found in marketing. I'm from the time when marketers were expected to be trendsetters and game changers, so I often don't want stability, I want change. \n\nAnd, although marketing as a field is not stable, humans are still humans, markets are still markets. So, that part is very stable to me. \n\nLots of things that I do in marketing have been basically the same for decades in marketing strategy and marketing analytics, just with some eventual updates like learning new tools. I may do my marketing analytics using R now, but old stuff like descriptive statistics, experiments, regression, statistical biases, sampling, correlation not implying in causation, and Garbage In Garbage Out are still basically the same.",

Even with a 1.1x roi on ads you're still making more than you're spending, and you probably need cash flow for more than one reason, so the #1 advice here should be to actually lobby for budget. If your company is that utterly broke, and with that heavy competition, you're betting on a dead horse.\n\n\nAs a final note, just saying \"we're SaaS\" gives absolutely zero.zero insight in what you are doing, so asking what marketing strategy works is pretty useless.

      "text": "This might be a naive question but I work for a startup. I’m the only marketing person. I hav a freelance designer who helps out 15 hrs a week and if I do have support, its freelancer. Currently I’m organizing a huge event in Vegas including all the 25 people going there, their teams for their external demonstrations, hotel, flights, all admin including dinners, team events. I am preparing the stand messaging, design, and build. I’m preparing press. Social media. All the content around that and needed assets. Ads. But at the same time time I need to work on the rest of the marketing goals for the year and have random admin tasks that have little to do with marketing. Each of these is a huge undertaking, because none of these are straightforward and simple, and everyone I work with has a shit ton of feedback and like to change things up to literally the day of. Think this attitude: it’s fine if we don’t print the vinyl for the stand even if it’s the day of it’s an easy go to quickly adjust design, print it, and slap it over x area. OR: for this press release, let’s ignore reaching out to the people who provided quotes until literally after we’ve sent the press release off because „we can always add it later“and „if they say they need it by x, they don’t really mean it“- not taking into account that maybe it’s also because I hav 1000 things I need to do at once and it would be nice to follow a timeline that makes me not want to off myself. Maybe it’s cause I’ve been at startups only. It’s cool on one hand when things are going good. But lately I just hate it. I’m just here for my portfolio. This event I need to share a room for 2 -3 weeks. I have a chronic condition but I can hardly mention I’m in debilitating pain every night because everyone is in th same boat an they’ll look down on me like I’m not pulling my weight when everyone else is. Since I’m organisieng everything I tried to get rooms for everyone, it wasn’t approved. I tried to get a card for everyone, or at least a stipend they get paid before (I just assume most people don’t want to pay 3 meals per day in an expensive US city for 2 weeks out of their own pocket), and this was also shot down. I feel like I’m the weid one for pushing back on things like: organise a party for after the event. Or during at like 9pm. I just think absolutely not. People will be dead. We need to clean up and pack. Then fly back 18 hrs the next day. And I’m supposed to also organise that? Like I’m going to be DEAD. At the end of each day. Like… is this normal??? Or am I just complaining too much.",

That is an extremely heavy workload for one person, and a lot of what you described is not even marketing work, it is ops and event logistics layered on top of strategy and execution.

The fact that you are also dealing with a chronic condition makes the lack of consideration even more concerning.

You’re not just doing marketing, you’re acting as event manager, project manager, ops, admin, and emotional buffer for everyone else’s bad planning.\n\nWhat you’re describing is classic startup chaos where everything is treated as flexible except the one person actually responsible for execution. People saying we can change it last minute or we can add it later are usually not the ones staying up late fixing it or dealing with vendors, press, or logistics when things go wrong.\n\nThe room sharing and lack of stipend is honestly a red flag, especially given you have a chronic condition. That’s not you being difficult, that’s basic duty of care. The fact you even tried to advocate for reasonable stuff and got shut down says a lot about the culture.\n\nYou’re also not wrong about the exhaustion. Events like this are brutal even with a full team. Doing it solo while still expected to hit yearly marketing goals is not sustainable, and it’s normal that you’re burnt out and angry.\n\nIf you stay, you probably need to set firmer boundaries and force prioritisation in writing. If you’re mainly there for portfolio, I’d quietly get this event done, document the hell out of it for your CV, and start planning your exit. You’re not complaining too much.

It also helps to productize the offer a bit so the sales conversation is tighter and easier to explain. The goal is fewer, higher intent conversations instead of more hours on the phone.",

My best performing campaigns right now have literally zero interests or lookalikes and just rely on the creative to find the buyer.

It's different from the time when we had more control over how the algorithm works. Now, it \"decides\" itself without showing what it does. \n\nAnd that decision can include messing things up so the company will make much more money with people testing things endlessly. And, when people start to get a conclusion, they can update the algorithm and the cycle repeats.\n\nI think targeting is far from being dead. I think targeting is very important. But targeting is more about the target audience, so I tend to focus on people for that. \n\nAlgorithms are very alive, but not necessarily your friends.",

Broad tends to outperform once you get past the learning phase, but it also shifts more responsibility onto creative and offer quality.

For EU i would also consider the whole cookie banner issue with website data, that always changes A LOT because hardly anyone accepts them anymore.\nFor the rest, it sound like you getting either a lot of bots or a lot of confused clicks. Did you check how your creatives look on mobile? Does your target audience fit the people you want to get to your website? Is your pacing maybe to high e.g. Too much budget and reddit is just randomly showing your ads to clicky people so they can spend the money?\nIn general, i would not start out on a new platform with traffic ads. Go brand awareness first and test audienced, keep it at a low test budget, then bring in the clicky buy ads.",

Most of the \"engagement\" I get these days is from bots, even as LinkedIn are actively throttling organic reach. In the meantime, they've given us zero innovation in the past decade other than some weird games. It's sad to see how far a once great platform has fallen.",
