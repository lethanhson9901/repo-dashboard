Even then it was pretty obvious that niche marketing roles were going away in favor of Jack of all trades type positions. That became even more obvious when I moved into being a marketing consultant at a digital marketing SaaS company. It felt like every year my clients were telling me about their marketing teams getting laid off or shrinking. People wonder why most marketing is shit these days. That's a big part of why.",

I’m getting really good vibes about the new company and I already have the offer letter, offering me a lot more financially and responsibility wise than my current role. I’ve made a list of the pros and cons and I’m heavily leaning towards taking the new role. There are no obvious red flags in my view. \n\nMy main hesitation is that this is a startup (higher risk) and I’m at a stage where I’m looking for stability due to where I’m at in my life.\n\nI’m also feeling intimated about stepping into such a senior position after a short period of time in this career, despite my broader professional experience. \n\nI’m not usually a risk taker but if I didn’t take this opportunity, I think I’d regret it. Has anyone made a similar leap? I know it’ll be a lot of work, but can you give me realistic advice about making this step?",

How experienced are your team?\n\nI made the mistake of going from junior marketing to head of marketing for a small company and it's caused me so much stress. I entered a company who had no processes in place, no room for any kind of marketing budget and a fucked up CRM that is taking months to properly clean. I was told I'd have \"marketing support\" which essentially meant a dirt cheap agency in India who have no marketing knowledge whatsoever and unpaid interns. \n\nMy first ever job was a startup. The pay was awful but I loved it. The difference is that there were people there who knew what the fuck they were doing. The CEO wasn't afraid to bring in external support. There was clear communication",

At early stage companies, head of marketing often means builder, operator, and firefighter all at once, not strategist with a team. The risk question is real, so I would get very clear on runway, expectations for the first 6 to 12 months, and what success looks like if things do not go perfectly. Feeling intimidated is normal, especially when the role jumps faster than the years suggest, but your prior career experience still counts a lot in leadership and decision making. If the company understands what they are hiring you for and you understand the tradeoffs, it can be a great learning curve. Regret usually comes more from unclear scope than from taking the risk itself.",

(Huge red flag in hindsight). \n\nWhether or not I was really “ready” for manager level 2 years ago was arguable, sure. Now? I most certainly am after the extensive skill and knowledge gain ive accrued after being at this 2nd company for years and the marketing industry for 4. My knowledge and skill are vastly beyond the other associate level employees currently on the team. They’ve had me working the same workload as the other managers mind you because theyve said they want to promote me (another huge red flag, I know).\n\nThen comes last week, company wide review time where promotions are given out. My boss let me know she put me forward for promotion consideration last November. I know the timeline of 2 years at the company works at associate level to get to manager level because that’s exactly the timeline for one of my coworkers.\n\nThen, not only do I find out this shit company added in an extra step before manager level (senior associate) and that’s what I was under consideration for, its not up to my boss - it’s up to the executives. This is a huge company and I never interact with them. I do like and trust my boss shes great but the executives are shit. And my boss let me know this week that the executives decided to not promote me to senior associate at this time as they want to see more of how I work at this manager level workload.\n\nMind you I was handed the manager level workload 3 months after I was initially hired 2 years ago. \n\nSo anyways yeah I know they’re blatantly taking advantage of me, they’re blatantly taking advantage of a lot of people at this company. And every time I doubt myself whether or not I’m really qualified to be at manager or senior manager or higher level, I look at some of my peers in marketing who are my same age and have my same years of experience and they are higher than me, and I remember that I have legitimately been working at manager level for 2 years now, just haven’t had the title. Oh and this company was about to hire me at manager level 2 years ago too.\n\nI’m hot on the job search, I have a very strong lead for manager level and I’m trying to get the fuck out of this shit place asap. I really, really want to leave this company high and dry with the conference I’m managing and not even give them my 2 weeks after this slap in the face - and for so many other reasons, a laundry list of grievances against this company and how they don’t treat me or any of us working there right. I hope this strong manager lead goes somewhere and then I’m gone in just a few weeks.\n\nMy point is: don’t be worried about whether or not you can handle it. If you like marketing, take this position. Being a head of a marketing team will be amazing for your resume and experience, and if you find you don’t like it and want a more low-stress option, you can do that later. With this under your belt, you’ll be able to pretty much do whatever level role you want in marketing forever after. That’s my advice since you’re at this early stage.",

      "text": "Every startup I join somehow feels more extreme than the last. I now work at a tech startup. I’m juggling an absurd amount of work, constantly context-switching, owning way too many things at once, and I’ve been overwhelmed for… honestly, about a year now. I’m exhausted and unhappy, and I’m tired of feeling like I’m always complaining about my job but I genuinely don’t know how much longer I can do this.\n\nThe thing is: I know I’m good at what I do. I work in marketing, but I’m not a deep specialist in one narrow area. Instead, I’ve done pretty much everything over the years: strategy, content, brand, PR, events, social, working with agencies and freelancers, project managing, firefighting, all of it. Mostly because I had to. I understand how long things actually take, what resources are needed, how things should be structured, and what breaks when they’re not.\n\nBut I’m so tired of doing the jobs of 10 people in environments with constant ambiguity, changing priorities, and zero follow-through from others. The “everything is urgent, everything keeps changing” culture is completely frying my brain.\n\nYesterday was kind of a breaking point. I had a meeting where I suddenly just… blanked. I was supposed to explain something fairly basic — the goal of a press release and the story behind it. But after weeks of constant story changes, lack of decisions, people not doing what we agreed on, and me juggling a million things at once, I genuinely didn’t know what to say anymore. I realized I don’t even know what our story is right now. My brain just shut down.\n\nThat scared me, because I’ve always been high-functioning and resilient. But now it feels like my brain is overloaded and I can’t structure things properly anymore.\n\nSo my question is: if I start looking for another job in marketing, what kinds of roles should I be looking for? Ones where broad experience is actually valued but where I don’t have to live in constant chaos or sacrifice my health. I don’t want to grind myself into the ground anymore. I just want a normal, sustainable workload with clearer structure.\n\nIf you’ve been through something similar or made a move out of this kind of environment, I’d really appreciate hearing what worked for you.",

Now that I’ve got more experience it feels more useful.\n\nMade to stick isn’t technically about marketing but is great for understanding the storytelling aspect. Same with Donald Miller’s Building a Storybrand. Outliers by Gladwell is even further from marketing but it’s tangentially related and very interesting.\n\nI really liked Hey Whipple, Squeeze This and Ogilvy on Advertising. A bit older and more of a focus on copywriting, but good foundational knowledge IMO. \n\nThe 22 immutable laws of marketing is also solid, have to take some of it with a grain of salt since the industry has changed so much since the first pub, but a lot of “learn the rules before you break them” in there.",

I don't like to waste money. \n\nI think more like a sniper. I don't want to use a machine gun, shooting a lot of bullets. I prefer to use only a few bullets, but be very effetive when doing that. As much as I can, I want every shot to count. \n\nSo, I want to analyze the situation very well before shooting. That's basically marketing research and marketing anaytics.\n\nI want to get to the right position before shooting. That's positioning in marketing.\n\nI want to aim well before shooting. That's targeting in marketing. \n\nAfter I analyze the situation, have my positioning strategy, have my targeting strategy, then I shoot. That's when ads, content, and SEO may happen. However, I don't want to shoot everywhere. Actions should follow strategy to me. I don't like when people shoot first and ask later. \n\nYou basically mentioned Promotion. But there are times when my analysis showed that the problem was elsewhere. Maybe the product portfolio is wrong. Maybe it's too expensive. Maybe there are problems with distribution and delivery. Even with promotion, maybe my communication is targeting the wrong audience. \n\nUsually, ads are the lasts step in the process for me because ads cost a lot of money, and I don't like spending money without being more sure about what I'm doing. That was true when investing in stocks in Finance, that's still true when investing in marketing actions. \n\nAds often come after I have a working strategy with good results and understanding with organic promotion, for example. That shows I'm probably ready to move to ads. \n\nAnd it's important to remember there are tons of forms of media. When I ask people why they are using a specific media, like happened a lot with TikTok in the last years, the answer often was \"because everyone\" is doing that. Not because that matched their strategies well. \n\nTheer are tons of people investing a lot of money in ads to get vanity metrics and bots, and that's the opposite of ROI to me.",

Even simple Canva templates with interchangeable copy and images let you rotate creatives quickly. A VA can help a lot with tracking results, pulling reports, and swapping assets, especially if you give clear instructions and a simple workflow. AI tools can assist with copy variations, but you still want someone to review for local tone and relevance. The key is building a system that scales without you doing everything manually.",

          "text": "the biggest time-saver I've found for local Facebook ads isn't producing more creatives, it's knowing exactly when your current ones start dying so you're not refreshing prematurely or too late. What I'd do at $200/day-ish local spend: run 3-4 ad variations at a time and watch the CTR trend line at the ad level, not the ad set level. When an individual ad's CTR drops below your account average by 20%+ over a 3-day window, that's your signal to swap it out. Most people don't refresh enough or refresh way too often because they're guessing. For the actual creative production: batch it. Spend one afternoon per month shooting 15-20 short clips at the studio (students dancing, class energy, instructor moments) and screenshot 8-10 testimonials or reviews. That gives you enough raw material to remix into new ads weekly with just a Canva template swap. The \"fresh\" part that Meta's algorithm cares about isn't radical redesigns, it's new creative IDs with slightly different hooks and visuals. The benefit of lots of creatives is only tangible if the messaging, ad type, and demo representation in the assets are diverse, which meta auction rewards by unlocking unique reach. On the VA question: a VA for optimization is risky unless they deeply understand Meta's auction dynamics. What works better at your scale is having a clear system, a simple spreadsheet tracking CPL by ad by week and letting that data tell you what to change rather than relying on someone's gut.",

One great way to see if an agency knows their staff is to have them draw their approach/process for solving marketing problems on a white board. if they can’t, move on.\n\nLook for companies that have been in business more than ten years. Look up the people who run the agency. What did they do before they started the agency? was it unrelated to marketing? That’s a red flag. what is their education and in what field? It should be marketing or closely related. \n\nA good agency won’t be eager. They will be asking business questions to understand in detail if they can meet your objections. They won’t make promises or guarantees. \n\nMost agencies fail because of the client. Clients that don’t know what they want, have nobody in-house who understands marketing, doesn’t want to pay for planning, wants results immediately, have unrealistic budgets, don’t deliver approvals and input in a timely manner, don’t follow recommendations or picks and chooses parts of the strategy - if the agency is legit, it is usually the client who creates the failure state. \n\nIf the company is focused on tactics (for example a company that sells advertising will recommend advertising. A branding firm will tell you branding is the answer. a web dev company sells websites. when they only own a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\n\nFirst hire a consultant who really knows the marketing and business world on a temporary assignment to put together criteria and help you interview potential partners.

So I don't think you know enough about marketing, less how hiring a marketing firm works, to be demanding a partner be held to arbitrarily-set standards. \n\nThe proper process is:\n\nFirst you issue an RFP with a clearly stated *business problem.* You should include goals and desired outcomes, but those are not KPIs - those are to be agreed to later, once the plan is in place. Set a budget for discovery and strategic planning, and ensure a range for execution depending on the final scope so the firms know what they're dealing with. Give them three to six weeks to complete the pitch, depending on the size of the RFP. \n\nOnce you've got the RFP responses in, you select. At that point, you'll give them the actual campaign or project brief. If you are using the same one as the pitch, you let them go back to the board and do a proper Discovery, because everything they did in the pitch was hypothetical and based mostly on deskside research; once hired you are able to give them more access to the research and data they need to be more precise. \n\nThen, once you've gotten into the rounds of review in the strategic planning process, you'll agree to the right KPIs that support the business goals as stated in the brief. They may not be the ones you listed at all. But the plan is something everyone agrees to, and is the roadmap for performance of duties therein. That's what holds everyone, including you, accountable for all of the roles and responsibilities required to get you there.\n\nAnd also, before you do any of this, you need a real marketer on staff, because you don't appear to have any grasp of the most basic of facts: that Marketing has no control over what happens once they deliver you a lead, so if your site sucks, your value prop isn't clear, your checkout or sales process is shit, or your product is vaporware, you have no business demanding any KPI be met. Particularly KPIs you appear to have set in a vacuum.\n\nAlso, it's inappropriate to ask a marketing vendor to set up your sales funnel. That's something your Sales team is responsible for setting up in whatever CRM engine they've selected. Marketing can integrate with a number of CRM types, but you need to set the tone, because Sales will set that process and they'll be dicking around in it more. \n\nMarketing is a team sport, not a pyre upon which you place your marketing partner, douse it in your failure to deliver, and strike the clause that burns everything, including your money.",

A shitty story is a shitty story regardless of format.\n\nBut that's exactly what you're doing now. Your marketer wrote a shitty book and it crashed and burned on Meta. Now he's trying it on Google.\n\nGo back to the fundamentals. Create a killer offer. Figure out the best way to present it. Decide how to get eyeballs on it.

If it was the latter, that should still have a lead (or custom) signal set up for a conversion campaign. My guess would be something was off there. Short of something completely wrong with the audience targeting (not impossible with Advantage+), Meta usually casts a wide net and reels it in as it learns.\n\nAlso, I should clarify there's nothing wrong with a PPC campaign for upper funnel if you're looking at a longer sales cycle, but it would usually be complimented by a retargeting campaign to follow those people around until you get a purchase.\n\nNot sure what your average purchase is, but I would think a regular sales campaign should at least be generating view thru purchases, which is where we circle back to my first hunch.\n\nI hope this helps a little.

If a leader suggests a publication, I try to walk through audience fit, measurable outcomes, and opportunity cost compared to what’s already working. Sometimes that naturally cools the idea down without a hard no.\n\nWhen measurement is weak, I also like to position it as a test with clear expectations upfront. Budget, timeframe, and what success would realistically look like, even if it’s directional. If leadership still wants it after that, at least it’s a conscious tradeoff rather than a default yes.
