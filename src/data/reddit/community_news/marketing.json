I don't see how that could possibly be outdated because it's not about what to do as much as it is about why things work.\n\n$100M Offers is entirely about offer creation, as the name suggests. It's a fine book. I thought it was largely overhyped, but then it makes sense because there's a whole crowd of entrepreneurs / marketers who don't even know that DR marketing is something that exists.",

You will stumble on some useful info. You don't want to get distracted and drown in that mountain of info. Jot town YOUR key problem, the title of the book, author, and make a comment as to \"why?\" you need to get back to this info.\n\nNow that you're equipped with the \"right\" tools, spend at most 20 minutes per session surfing for YOUR answers. \n\nAnd yes, there are many more ways to tame info noise and see through the mist. \n\nHappy prospecting!",

I like to narrow it down to be specific about some things that already interest me. For instance, how did Reddit scale, how did AirBnB scale, how did Yelp scale, how did Instagram scale. \n\nThey each did it differently and they are each unique to their niche so its interesting to see what worked and what didnt work. Harvard Business Review Case Studies usually go in depth with what worked and didint work. All of this has helped me think about what to do, what not to do - or even how to think about things differently. \n\nThe only book for marketing I would recommend is Positioning: The Battle for your mind . Everyone needs to the know the basics and then you develop a unique strategy from there for whatever it is that you are marketing. I learned from someone a few years ago that \"Marketing is just creative problem solving\". If you know the basics of marketing, have a few examples of success and failures, then you have the tools to be creative with your problem solving to develop a marketing strategy. ",

In actuality, I’m not spending all day building my business because I love my family, which he doesn’t have other than his wife and would rather have less money but more time.\n\nThe best marketing principles come from personal development and human behavior, which is all marketing and sales is.\n\nI will vouch for the secrets series by Russell Brunson because there’s a lot of great information but mostly for info marketing. It applies and he speaks directly to product marketing as well but the reality is that products have way more financial requirements like stock, inventory, seasons, etc., and aren’t as easy to pivot so this won’t be as useful.",

At a lot of big tech co's they call everyone who works on marketing a product a PMM.

I learned this the hard way when I was Head of Growth at a fintech and realized I was spending 70% of my time in status meetings instead of building campaigns or analyzing data. The trick that saved my sanity was implementing \"deep work blocks\" where I literally blocked my calendar from 9-11am every day for actual marketing work, and I made it non-negotiable. I also started pushing back on any meeting that didnt have a clear agenda or decision to be made, which cut my meeting load by about 40%.",

          "text": "At least you get that far.  I've been places where the job is just trying to get into meetings.  As in, try to join, but for some reason you need to be on the vpn to access teams--so try to connect to the vpn, get out your authenticator app on your phone, wait for the next set of numbers because this set will be done by the time you type it, try to open teams, it crashes, so then try to open a private window or different browser, type your name, wait for someone let to you in.\n\nThe key is:  at places like that, don't worry about getting work done.  It's the effort that counts.  If companies wanted you to get work done, they'd make it easy to do so and they'd give you time to do so.  Instead, they add overhead to try to micromanage and force you to be present for a set amount of time--and they want you to invest 100% of the cost of the overhead and get the work done on your own time.\n\nSync ups are managers' way of knowing what you're doing so they can get credit (and compensation) for coordinating it.  If this communication takes as long as it takes to do the work, the manager is really bad at their job.  Their job is to build a process to minimize distraction (including themselves) and maximize your productivity--the quality / quantity of what you produce.\n\nBut nah.  The quality of your work should reflect (at least in part) the amount of effort that actually went into it.  If you've got 5 minutes in-between meetings to make graphics, you should be commended for drawing a stick figure in paint and typing some words below it.  Make sure to spend an extra 5 minutes explaining why it is so shitty.\n\nThey're going to attempt to replace you with AI anyway, citing efficiency.  Efficiency being the very thing that they made worse in their micromanagement efforts.\n\n(BTW, I'm actually on the executive management side of things, and I hate when this sort of thing happens--unfortunately all too commonly.  It tends to happen more at larger corporations and much less at smaller startups).",

I think there are two skills or groups of skills that changed the game for me:\n\n\\- Networking if you include social skills. Social skills often get much more important for higher jobs related to leadership, management, teams, and corporate politics. And that can lead to a much higher income.\n\n\\- Marketing analytics with data analytics, statistics, coding. Analytics can be very helpful to see what others are not seeing, develop better strategies, get stronger evidence to make better decisions, and get better results. Then, higher income is expected.\n\nI remember what someone told me once. If I want more more, I shold be closer to the money. If I'm far from the money, just following orders instead of making decisions, then it's hard to expect others to decide to give me more money. \n\nBut there are some important details. \n\nThis isn't a straight line. I did make less money for a time until I started to make much more money. I had to invest first to have return later.\n\nSome factors were extremely helpful in unexpected ways. Since I'm more of a generalist, I was criticized for spreading myself too thin or doing too many things that were irrelevant. A big example to me is AI. About 10 years ago, almost nobody in marketing cared about AI. And I was talking about AI because of my interest in games with the AlphaGo project. Now, my skills related to AI are very important, and people in marketing don't think they are irrelevant anymore. ",

Fortune 500 brands, global agencies, I have seen many fail here.  If you can't define what \"is\" is, then improvement is impossible. If you don't fully understand or are working off of erred info, your actions will be misdirected. Becoming extremely curious about data, finding where the dots connect and identifying when metrics and data are not making sense (not taking it at face value) is a skillet I see rarely. I was a math major before I flipped to marketing so I had a leg up. You do not have to be a math major to question findings and pursue real understanding. And, you can always hire analytics people who think more like business people and can help in the pursuit of truth vs justification of efforts.",

This is a high-leverage skill because you aren't just an 'editor'—you are a performance marketer who understands retention psychology.\n\n**Why it pays more than general marketing:**\n\n* **Efficiency through AI:** While most marketers spend hours on one video, I use a tool called **Keyvello** to automate the script-to-visual workflow. I can produce 5x the volume of a traditional agency with 90% less manual effort.\n* **Direct ROI:** High-retention videos (especially in ASMR or 'Product Trivia' niches) drive measurable sales and lower customer acquisition costs (CAC).\n* **Mastery Timeline:** It took me about 3 months to dial in the 'hook-to-CTA' logic, but once you have the templates ready (like the ASMR ones in Keyvello), you can scale your income by managing multiple accounts simultaneously.\n\nIf you want to increase your rates, stop offering 'posts' and start offering 'retention-optimized systems'.",

I can tell you that it’s not for everyone, especially when you’re deposed and then need to testify at trial. For income, I can charge whatever I want. Marketing related expert witness charge $300-1200 per hour, with most cases being 10-50 hours of work. \n\nFor skills, it’s not necessarily one or the other skill. It’s the fact that you’re someone who specializes in that skill. For example, I know a guy who specializes in analytics.

I do not know how to parse this type of ask to be honest. We are not a unique industry, we aren't going to create some insane distinguished value prop.

I am rethinking if I want to be at this level in my career at all.\n\nMaybe I'm just venting about having to make decks haha, but curious as to how others took the leap in their career at this point.

That is sausage-making, as they say. You have your team to discuss those particulars with. Instead, focus on the *why* you need to execute. What are we looking to accomplish? Why is that important? Dumb it down, but root it in facts and figures. Anchor these whys in core business objectives.\n\nIf you're working on a UX project, for example, frame it as \"Improving onsite/in app efficiency/usablility to increase ROI with no change in marketing spend\" rather than a specific explaining what the actual improvement is.\n\nFocus on the destination, not the journey.",

What’s your category? What’s happening to it - risks, challenges, headwinds, tailwinds. What’s the opportunity? Then craft a statement, an articulation that provides a strategic north star (e.g. “Let our users do the talking”). Then you can hone in on how your department/team can help achieve that tactically (e.g put users at the center of our creative). \n\nThere are tons of frameworks to visualize strategy, like flywheels, positioning maps, anything on a x/y axis format, today/tomorrow, “from: X to Z; Y to W” etc. pick the one you think best illustrates the direction you have in mind.\n\nAlso ask why several times against your tactics. We need to improve X metric. Why? X5. This is a nice way of getting closer to big picture thinking. \n\nIn my experience, execs prefer strategy over tactics because strategy is usually something they can grasp even if they don’t have in depth know how of a particular channel (e.g social media), so you can get their buy in at the strategic level, and they leave the tactics to you/specialists.

Lots of people can do the day to day grunt work of your job, but what problems have you solved and what big moves have you made?\n\n3. What are the next problems you're going to solve beyond day to day stuff and what's the forecasted impact? At the Director level they want you to call your shot and deliver reliable forecasts.\n\n4.

I've had total visibility of how the start-up is run, being really close to management. But my job? Making content, writing pitch decks, some targeted campaigns, designing brand kit, some CRM implementation, ...\n\nAs I've never had someone senior to me or a department, I never even learned how marketing systems work. Just mindlessly doing actions based on the sales strategy of the management.\n\nJust come across the other post in this sub earlier today asking \"how would you rate your marketing skills\" and someone else answering about his skills across: \n\nMarketing Strategy-  Data analytics - Finance-Marketing interface - International Marketing Entertainment Marketing - Networking - Pricing -  Trade Marketing - Product Marketing-  Promotion. \n\nCouldn't place myself above bottom 10% in any of these. To be totally fair, I haven't even done anything related to most of those. \n\nHere's the catch: my start-up used to be in B2B marketing, with a 3 year sales cycle and a few sales per year (X.X M€ per sale), which are basically impossible to track with systems. It's all business development and sales. \n\nNow I'm moving on from that position (still into a sole-marketeer B2B position, but with a better potential of building a marketing department and with a fresh mindset) , I feel kind of ashamed of my strategic skillset after 5 years and would like to fast track the development. \n\nWhat would you recommend? Without peers to learn from, what's the best way to become a kick-ass marketeer?\n\n",

You’ve been running campaigns, managing content, implementing CRM, and touching brand, that’s experience most people don’t get until much later. If you want to fast-track strategic skills, I’d focus on two things: documenting what works and why, and studying frameworks for B2B marketing at scale. Case studies, post-mortems, and even reverse-engineering campaigns from companies in similar spaces can help you see the bigger picture. Pair that with tools and analytics practice, and you’ll start bridging the gap between tactical execution and strategic thinking Honestly, the fact that you’re reflecting on this now is already a step ahead of most people in similar roles.",

I spent 5 years as a trade marketing manager for a small business — but I did B2B, B2C, trade, sales promotion planning, HUGE data analytics learning experience from analysis to strategy or product development that I just realized is likely the most notable thing about me. I learned how to support a sales team, and worked directly with the sales director planning strategies. I developed my creative direction getting ads over the line for print, digital, OOH, in-store etc, overall brand management. Owning A&P budgets for suppliers ranging from 50-100k to upwards of 1.5M. Oh, can’t forget procurement and vendor management/relationships, strong sales and marketing decks specific/changed for certain audiences, client relations, and I am sure I’m missing a lot. \n\nIt was a very busy job, and at the time I didn’t realize how much I was learning, and how useful the smorgasbord of tasks would be for my future career. \n\nSince I left that job, I’ve had 2 other jobs in brand marketing/management, significantly raised my salary on the route, have full teams under me, and landed a fractional VP role in commercial, and all remote, all start-ups. I also pick up contracts for data, brand design, marketing strategies.  And I used EVERY SINGLE one of these skills to get here. \n\nSOAK IT ALL UP — put it to paper, and you’ll see the growth and experience you really do have!!!",

          "text": "You mentioned my case, but context matters a lot. \n\nI also sucked in the beginning. But I'm not a beginner anymore. \n\nI'm 52 years old. With a career of decades. In industry and academia. Living in 3 countries and knowing much more than that. A BS, MS, MBA, and PhD. Working with social media when people didn't call that social media yet. Being involved with AI years before it became popular. Being involved with arts and entertainment my whole life. \n\nAlso, differentiation is very important to me. It's nearly impossible to be similar to me, and that shouldn't be the goal. \n\nI remember a former boss who told me I'd never be successful in marketing. \n\nMy recommendation is to think about your own strategy. What is your targeting strategy, like the type of job and company you have as goals? What is your positioning strategy, like the type of reputation you want to develop?\n\nAnd then, network and try to find someone who is following a similar path and is ahead of you. I didn't get here alone. But I had to find the right people and engage with them, it's not something that just happened. \n\nWaiting for the company or others to help me would be a terrible idea. I had to take responsibility for my future.\n\nMy path is far from being a straight line.\n\nTo be good at the finance-marketing interface now, I worked a lot with finance and accounting, I worked for investors to analyze startups, and I did my master's in corporate finance.\n\nTo be good at entertainment marketing now, I worked as a comic book writer and I worked for a tv company. I traveled to Broadway lots of times. I develop my games as a hobby.\n\nTo be good at international marketing, I used the fact that I was \"invisible\" to most marketers because of my background. Then, instead of seeing people and countries that others usually know, I saw the invisible like me. \n\nEventually, those different paths merged to make me what I am today. But I wasn't even planning to be in marketing. I didn't apply to my first official job in marketing, it's the company that found me. \n\nSucking in the beginning is natural, expected. Startups are, by definition, starting. They shouldn't act as if they are mature companies, although many do.\n\nI told a mentee some time ago: don't be better, be different, be yourself. \n\nThere will always be someone better than me if we're talking about marketing skills. But there won't be someone better than me if we're talking about being myself. \n\nFor example, I always say that marketing literally starts with market, which is basically consumers. But, when I interview job applicants, I see many people who know about media and computers but don't know about customers and people. \n\nNow, even knowing the basics is enough to make a job applicant stand out to me.\n\nWith the finance-marketing interface, not many marketers can talk about the differences between sales, revenue, profit, cash generation, and value.\n\nWith marketing analytics, not many marketers can discuss correlation not being causation in marketing practice, garbage in garbage out, and statistical biases. Even if that's statistics 101.",

Blatantly \n\nAlso a lot of time they gave you BS by quoting some paper or the other without context. And the nail in the coffin- zero respect for CI . Like who gave a fuck \n\nComing to you. My question is over 5 years why did you not look for another job elsewhere? \n\nMarketing isn’t a trade yiu understand by learning in the job. Things like CI And brand and architecture and sub brands and strategy and originality etc , and ideas don’t just come from a place where ur ceo tells you what to do . So why?",

I was hired with only college (in canada we have college/hands on vocational level, hands on experience — and university’s for “professional” designations).

Eclectic backgrounds has always given me the best workers. Uni graduates have given me the least useful. \n\nBut that’s the beauty of anecdotes.",

I feel like my skillset is more in how to work at my particular company than anything marketing relevant at this point. \n\nThe company founder recently retired, and we got acquired. I'm seeing the writing on the wall that they're trying to shut our office down, about half of the team has quit and no one is being replaced. I'm starting to look at what jobs are out there.\n\nThe issue is.... I think I'm just burned out with marketing. AI does not interest me in the least, I'm actually a little bit disgusted by it, but it seems to be the future of marketing (and unfortunately everything at this point)\n\n  \nLooking for any hopeful stories for people whom successfully pivoted to a different career after being in marketing.

Linked a simple form. Sent $25 food credits to 500 devs.\n\nTotal cost: $12.5k.  \nNo hard pitch. No demo link.  \nJust goodwill.\n\nResult: multi-million dollar pipeline generated from conversations that followed.\n\nIt made me rethink how we approach lead gen in B2B SaaS.\n\nWhat’s one unconventional marketing experiment you’ve tried that brought high-quality leads?\n\nWould love specifics — cost, channel, and whether you’d do it again.",

Not just work he assigned to me, but work that our mutual corporate overlords have included in the overall corp marketing plan and devote staff, budget and time towards executing. \n\nI did in the moment and will continue to counter his objections, which amount to “our audience is only on LinkedIn”. That’s demonstrably false. He just doesn’t understand marketing outside of endemic channels. He also has the very boomer belief that “the kids are using fb and instagram and adults are using LinkedIn”. \n\nI guess I’m just expressing the frustration of being a marketing professional working for a non-marketing professional and having to educate them on things that are understood by anyone else as inherently valuable or at least required.

Until a company decided to hire me for a marketing job.\n\nIf something has an impact, show that with strong evidence. Research and Analytics often show how wrong marketers are in their opinions. Vanity metrics are very common, for example.\n\nToo many marketers think that the time for debate has passed, and jump to execution without strategy, analytics, and research.

      "text": "So the thing is i have spent the last few years working with companies ranging from scrappy startups to mid-sized SaaS platforms, and I keep seeing the same pattern: teams are burning budget on broad campaigns that generate \"leads\" but rarely convert the accounts that actually matter.\n\nHere's what changed my perspective on ABM:\n\nThe math just makes sense**.** If 20% of your prospects represent 80% of your potential revenue, why are we spending 80% of our budget trying to reach the other 80%? I watched one company cut their MQL target in half, focus on 50 key accounts, and double their pipeline value in a quarter.\n\nAlignment actually happens**.** every marketing team talks about sales-marketing alignment, but ABM forces it. When you're targeting specific accounts, sales and marketing HAVE to agree on who matters. I've seen this eliminate so much of the tension that usually exists between teams.\n\nThe content is actually useful**.** Instead of generic \"10 Tips for Better \\[Industry Thing\\]\" content, you're creating materials that speak to specific pain points of real companies. One client I worked with created a custom ROI calculator for their top 10 prospects. Three of them booked demos within two weeks.\n\nMeasurement becomes meaningful**.** Forget vanity metrics. With ABM, you're tracking account engagement, buying committee involvement, and actual pipeline from target accounts. The attribution is cleaner because you know exactly who you're trying to reach.\n\nThe biggest pushback I hear is \"we don't have the resources for that level of personalization.\" But you don't need to start with 100 accounts. Start with 10. Even 5. The insights you gain from deeply understanding those accounts will change how you think about your entire GTM strategy.\n\nAnyone else seeing ABM finally get the attention it deserves? Or still fighting the \"we need more leads!\" battle?",

Asset that speak to ultra specific pain points to the level of detail where it could almost name names. You need to be really in the know about the account, almost to the point where you know who’s having affairs. Detailed intel is used to create bespoke offering. Your typical marketing assets like whitepapers and ads don’t matter anywhere near as much as typical B2B, the assets that matter are held points of view, talk tracks, battle cry’s, specific high value strategic pitches on hyper specific business problems that usually cant be solved with something off the shelf. What I describe is pretty much only doable with large scale enterprise partnerships where a full time team is dedicated to that account working within the client  environment. Anything short of that can borrow some ABM tactics but watering it down can result in something more like “sparkling B2B”.\n\nYou might look at this laundry list and think isn’t this just sales? If a CEO wants this from their marketing team, it’s probably a sign that sales leadership is weak. If sales can be orchestrated properly, they’ll fill their own gaps assuming the quality of marketing enables them well enough. Sadly haven’t seen it and a big theme in my career has been picking up slack for others lack of skill.",

Many companies just rely on the options that platforms offer without thinking what is a good targeting strategy for them.\n\nIt's similar to marketing analytics, with marketers often not knowing much more than what platforms tell them like the so-called A/B tests and vanity metrics. \n\nWith or without Account-Based Marketing, I think targeting is very important, and analytics are then very useful to improve the process.",

That is the game now.\n\nWhat I am seeing actually work in 2026 is not some secret channel. It is depth over hacks.\n\nOwned audience is winning. Email lists, niche communities, newsletters, private groups. Not generic broadcast content, but tight positioning. The more specific the niche, the cheaper the growth. Broad content is expensive. Specific content compounds.\n\nFounder led content is also still working. Not polished brand posts. Real opinions, real breakdowns, behind the scenes, receipts. People trust people more than logos now. Boring corporate tone is dead.\n\nPartnership distribution is underrated too. Cross promos with adjacent creators, newsletter swaps, co hosted webinars, bundled offers. Borrowed trust converts better than cold traffic most of the time.\n\nSEO still works but only if you go deep on intent. Not generic blog spam. Actual problem solving pages that are better than the top 3 results. Fewer articles, more quality.\n\nPaid ads are not dead, but they only work if the offer is tight and the funnel is simple. Most people try to fix traffic when the real problem is positioning.\n\nEverything feels harder because lazy growth is gone. You need a clear niche, clear transformation and consistent distribution.\n\nIf you care about this stuff, building audience, monetising content, growing something real, I write weekly about what is working for me and what is not in my newsletter Wealth Rewired. No theory, just practical breakdowns. Might help if you are in the trenches right now.",

It’s a constant game of trying to get in front of the user. \n\nIt has also never been easier to market a business. We have access to the exact people we need to reach, either via paid ads or organic posting. Tools like Canva and CapCut put professional asset production within reach for millions (no Adobe license required), we have world-class automation tools, and AI can write (mediocre) ad creatives and help optimize paid campaigns if you upload a campaign export.",

I want something that is probably differentiated, that I believe to be related to my competencies to stand out, and that helps me with other parts of my career and life. I won't take somehing more related to execution like creating ads.\n\nSecond, my services are not standardized. I want to understand my audience first, their needs, their problems, and then think of something that is a better match. \n\nWhat I provide depends a lot on knowing the market. Networking is a very important part of that. \n\nOften, people from agencies have experience with a lot of different things but within promotion. If a potential clients wants someone for promotion, I recommend looking for an agency that does that.\n\nLately, the combination between the technological side and the human side seems to be getting more attention in my case. I've been involved with AI and data analytics for a long time. I've also been involved with storytelling, psychology, and arts for a long time. \n\nBut bridging different things is usually part of what I do. That can be bridging tech and humans, finance and marketing, west and east, strategy and tactics, or virtual and real, for example.",

I'm probably not for those who want advertising, social media marketing, digital marketing, SEO, PPC, PR, email marketing, etc. \n\nI don't think that I position myself as an expert, but more like the one-eyed king in the land of the blind. \n\nFor international marketing, for example,  it's just very rare to find someone with experience in multiple countries like me. \n\nFor marketing analytics, it's very hard to find someone who uses things like clustering and panel vector autoregressive models.\n\nWhen I network, people often remember me as the guy who used to work in comics.\n\nNow with the rise of AI, people think of me as the guy with the longest experience with AI, not the best. AI has been part of my life and career for about ten years, and that surprises people. \n\nMy positioning is more like being the only person they'll ever meet like me. If they can find someone else who can do the things that I do, they can go ahead and hire them. \n\nBut usually they can't find someone else who can do what I do. They can't find people who see what I see.\n\nWhen I got my first official job in marketing, I didn't apply for the job. It was the company that found me instead. They had hired many marketers, and were still unable to find what they wanted. \n\nThe situation probably got worse for them over time, and better for me. So many marketers jump to tactics and execution without strategy, especially jumping to Promotion. Analytics are often limited to to the so-called A/B tests by people who don't understand the basics like correlation is not causation or statistical biases. Marketers often know more about technology than about humans like customers. There are users here that consider any plan as strategy. Users who think that trying something makes that an experiment. Users that try to convince me that sales, revenue, profit, and value are all the same thing. \n\nI helped someone recently. That was more advice than consultancy, especially because it's not an industry for me. The person said it might be the smartest idea they had seen. But I don't think the idea was that smart. \n\nThe idea started with Segmentation, and everything else was a consequence. But, in a world where most marketers don't know about Segmentation anymore, that makes me the one-eyed king in the land of the blind. Even for AI, when we ask about Segmentation, the answer often is about Targeting instead of Segmentation.",

Not because you can’t do more, but because selling “everything” is a nightmare.\n\nSomething tied to revenue and easy to scope tends to land best. Paid acquisition for a specific channel, lifecycle email for ecommerce, conversion rate optimization for SaaS. Clear problem, clear KPI, clear pricing. It also makes case studies and referrals way simpler.\n\nThe other big thing I’d think about is operational load. When you’re solo, fulfillment, reporting, client comms, and compliance all sit with you. So I’d pick a service where you can build repeatable processes quickly and not reinvent the wheel for every client.\n\nCurious what you actually enjoy doing day to day. That usually ends up being the more sustainable niche than whatever’s “hot” at the moment.",

But that doesn't mean I recommend that to everyone. It's a big pivot, not easy to do.\n\nI'm also an international marketer. That means I'm more involved with different parts of the world. At the very least, capitalism can work in different ways in different places. The US is often ranked first in the rank of individualism, but other countries are much more collectivist or balanced, for example. Then, I often find marketing more meaningful in other countries. \n\nAnd, more than anything, I remember that marketing literally starts with market. And that basically means customers, people. Real, not digital. Social in a way that I don't think social media is anymore, as social media is often antisocial now. I want to deal with people and society, not with computers and technology although I do use computers and technology. I like to talk to people face to face, be there in the middle of the crowd, understand feelings and needs.",

That really clarified things for me and I knew I couldn't spend another 20-30 years doing this. I spent some time considering what I wanted to do with my life, what my non-negotiables were, etc. It has not been an easy or quick decision for me. I feel like I've considered every passing whim I've had in my life to decide haha. For me, I'll be going back to school in the fall to pursue social work. I'd suggest for you to go through a similar process and see if there's something still under the marketing umbrella you can pivot to, or if there's something outside of marketing entirely that you can do. As much as I'm disillusioned by it, there's still a lot I've learned from my marketing career that I feel can set me up for my next step, and the same is true for anyone.",

Even if you have high quality content, it might ignore you for a variety of inane reasons. Sometimes it's just delayed. Some LLM's do the search for you, but again, the results are highly personalized. \n\n5k organic visits per month is pretty low, honestly. What's your existing conversion rate? Are you focusing on paid opportunities through social media? \n\nIf you're a big enough brand, have you reached out to AI companies to do a proper partnership?
