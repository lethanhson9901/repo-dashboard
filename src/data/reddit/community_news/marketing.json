      "text": "New consumer trust report came out. 78% of Gen Z can identify AI generated images and will scroll past them.\n\nBeen running ads for an apparel brand targeting 18 to 25 year olds. Our CTR dropped 40% after we switched to AI generated lifestyle shots.\n\nThe images looked fine to me. Models wearing the clothes, decent lighting, no obvious errors. But apparently Gen Z can tell.\n\nWent back to real product photos and performance recovered. Not fully but better than the AI stuff.\n\nThe report mentioned things like lighting inconsistencies and unnatural shadows. Stuff that's not obvious unless you're looking for it.\n\nAI images probably work for some audiences but not others. Older demographics might not notice or care as much.\n\nEdit: for graphics and layouts i use X-Design since you control the inputs. But for photography targeting younger audiences, real still wins.\n\n",

You don't lower your standard for quality just because the AI made it in under 10 seconds. And you don't lower your bar for quality because it's not AI.\n\nAlso, there are too many variables at play to blindly attribute a drop in CTR directly to the use of ai-generated images. You could have just as easily had the same drop with a stock image. It could have been the wrong audience, it could be bad copywriting, bad offer, etc. Unless you are running surveys to get user feedback on your ads it's hard in general to determine exactly what could be causing a dip in performance.",

He's one of those high verbal IQ genius types, we were both former anthro majors with an interest in linguistics. He had literally been #1 of everyone a few times.\n\nOne of the languages he was doing was French. I actually happen to speak French. (I was fluent like 15 years ago, lol. Oral comprehension is rusty rn, but I can read fluently still. Ime, they say \"use it or you lose it,\" but it actually seems to come back if you start using it again.) \n\nI was noticing he'd been doing French on Duolingo for like, probably 2 years, at least 1 year, yet hadn't really progressed in what it was teaching him. I was like \"Wait, why aren't they moving you to like, other verb tenses or something?\"\n\nI don't use the app myself (tho I've played w it a bit in the past), so this is secondhand, but it kind of struck me as some kind of infinite French 101 loop that never really seemed to change or advance much.",

Basically, they try to be as weird as possible so that people post about them on their social media. They don't need to post about it, they can just do something weird and other people will post about it. I would argue that they know what they are doing, they are a big company and they've got many talented marketers so who we are who never knew their plans to say if this is good or trash? We don't even know their marketing goals at all.",

It’s not like people normally buy any of those on a daily basis (as opposed to practicing Duolingo daily). This is next level annoying marketing that should be illegal for the love of god!",

When I started to stop using it I’d get spammed on several fronts (email, text, app notifications, etc.). When I was tired of the spam I went to unsubscribe and the UI was a very typical annoying process. It left just enough a bad taste in my mouth to not like the brand. I say this while being an understanding digital marketer who can respect our industry’s work.\n\nI’m an adult with a busy life paying to use my own free time to learn a language, I don’t need duolingo bombarding me like a micromanager would. I didn’t appreciate the forced paywalls after already paying for their premium because I’m not paying double for a certain lesson type.",

In my experience, this just means they brought in some new marketing agency or specialist, and it's a quick and dirty way to show effort.\n\nDuolingo is particularly topical for me as I received an email from them just yesterday about the account we set up for one of my kids. I went into the app to check her status, her consecutive streak was a zero and she hadn't done anything in weeks or months.

I got let go in the spring of 2024 along with one more person and have been able to get a few interviews, but no offers yet. I’ve peeked in on them on LinkedIn every now and then and it looks like the company has contracted by about one-third since then due to people leaving and not being replaced.\n\nIt’s been an immensely frustrating job market. I was laid off in 2013 from a fairly visible role in the community, and quickly got a lot of offers for freelance or contracting work before going back to full-time five months later. I also managed to find a new role (at the agency) within three weeks of a layoff in 2022.\n\nBy contrast, this market just seems so much more competitive, with plenty of roles getting hundreds of applications. I know of two more people in my network who have also been struggling to find a role despite extensive experience and impressive resumes.\n\nMy wife works in health care and makes decent money, so thankfully we’re doing OK financially. I’ve been able to focus a bit more on child care while bringing in some money from freelancing and contract work, but am still plugging away at full-time roles that fit well. Currently in consideration for one that’s a great fit, so I’m really hopeful that will work out.",

Indeed, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, they’re all oversaturated and bloated with WAY too many irrelevant and unrelated job postings where the hiring manager has tagged “marketing” when the role is for customer support, or finance, or whatever other department that isn’t marketing. \n\nThey’re trying to cast as wide a net as possible in hopes that they can catch the eyes of top candidates but in reality we’re all just ships passing each-other in the dead of night. I finally found my current position by applying directly to companies through their careers pages after researching relevant employers in the industries I wanted to work in.",

Probably some **middle-management position lower than VP**.\n\nOr as an entrepreneur/consultant you can set your own schedule and how you work.",

My last job which I was at for 3 years, gave me a really bad burnout that I took a a year off just being unemployed to recover mentally. That job I was at, the company refused to hire more people, so I was doing every single task including admin and operations work, execution and strategy thinking - I was basically a one-man show.\n\nEver since that burn out, I knew I did not want to go back to the same role. I’m someone who enjoys creative marketing and in all honesty I don’t enjoy working with numbers, which I know is important to climb the Marketing career ladder. To be frank I also don’t enjoy strategy thinking but I’m excellent at executing plans or directions provided. Strategy thinking takes a toll on me mentally, as I always have this fear like I don’t know what I’m doing or what I’m doing isn’t good enough.\n\nI have been wanting to scale down to more junior Marketing roles like Marketing Coordinator where I do not need to be the one who comes up with strategy or be the decision-maker. Am I crazy for wanting this? Most people would feel like it’s such a waste for me to build up my career to this point only to go back to a junior position.\n\nDoes anyone have tips on how I can get interviews for junior Marketing roles when I’m already a Brand Manager?\n\nUpdate (adding some additional info):\n\nAfter my one year unemployment break, I did start working again in the same role (Brand Manager) at company A which basically the whole Marketing team left (I only found out during my first day) so I was a one-man show again so I left after 2 months. Then I joined company B as the same role again and realised I really do not enjoy coming up with strategies so I left after 3 months. I realised I did not solve the root cause which is that I do not want to do this role anymore which requires a lot of strategy-thinking and ownership. I’m someone who takes direction well but if you ask me to come up with the direction, I fall apart.",

They are using their linkedin pages as channels for distributing content and ideas.\n\nPersonally, I work as a freelance content marketer, and I'm working with a client who has asked me specifically to come up with a linkedin strategy like this for their founder.\n\nBut the more I work on it and do research, the more I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle in a sea of noise. \n\nSo many companies are trying this approach, and it has led to an absolute deluge of thinly veiled \"vulnerability porn-type\" content (i.e. mistakes i made doing X) and shallow advice.\n\nI feel this effort to make content more \"human\" often feels gimmicky and fails. Can content even be considered human if there is a team of marketers and a 10-page strategy doc behind it?\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of logging onto linkedin and hearing everyone's life stories, mistakes, lessons learned, and opinions. It's human, sure. But 95% of the time, it's not interesting.\n\nIs \"human\" content really the next big thing? Or is it passing? Is human content actually what people want to see from companies (and their founders), or does that just feel gimmicky and fake?",

It seems most companies or agencies have a huge blind spot when it comes to picking influencers. They keep picking creators based on a premium look or a wealthy lifestyle that has literally zero overlap with the brand’s real demographic. It’s frustrating to see mass market brands being promoted by influencers whose content screams fitness and healthy lifestyle.  \n  \nLike come on, why is your cheap greasy cookie filled with chocolate being promoted by a 20 year old from beverly hills who would literally never eat it? Or why do you choose a influencer who has a healthy lifestyle like a religion to promote your liquor brands? \n\nThe thing is, i'd actually be ok with these choices if it came with spectacular results but oh boy, at best you see some mild improvements in metrics. Like, it's almost never worth it. Again, not all campaigns are like that and not all brands but this seems to happens enough for me to talk about it.",

They turned out to be informed prospects, didn't need as much education, eager to chat, cared what the product feature set was vs others. Ended up changing the nature of the conversations completely. Early adopters stand in line, they don't need education or as much onboarding. They pay higher margins but also demand more features. It's like selling a different product.\n\nStill takes conversion optimization and has a learning curve, but that increased revenue because it shrank days to close. We could talk to more people and close more deals just getting to an informed decision much faster...\n\nPersonality cues worked too, they just mattered more for later adopters...",

You hadn’t convinced how a new slogan can work for them, just that the old one is tired in your eyes. That’s not enough of a reason with millions and hundreds of millions at stake. Have you done focus group testing to back your claim why new slogan is better than old? Receives more engagement? My guess is no. So it’s just your word against the school. The school will always win out. If you aren’t prepared to show data, then get out of the way. These are educators. If anyone can appreciate data it’s them. Do the work. Get some focus groups going. Orrrrrrr….. take your ideas to the social media side for A/B testing. It’s lower risk for failure and may strengthen your argument for change on future campaigns by showing engagement/follow-through. You will at least have some preliminary data sets to review and pitch. Some slogans are evergreen. They always work. Black Friday Sales as an example. You don’t have to be unique…. People already anticipate and expect it. Put your creative talents elsewhere and save your fight for another topic. This may not be the answer you want to hear, but one you should heed. Your career will be filled with battles to plant your flag in and make a stand. Make sure it’s one you want to do this with, or if you should regroup and lose the battle to win the larger war.",

Slow check-in, confusing apps, inconsistent data, and too many tools stitched together. Attendees started the day annoyed, and no campaign could really recover from that.\n\nOnce we focused on reducing friction at the operational level, engagement numbers improved without changing our marketing strategy much.\n\nCurious if others have seen this.  \nHave you ever discovered that an engagement or ROI issue was caused by tooling or operations rather than marketing itself?",

One thing that can help is tracking where your mentions are actually happening and what context people are talking about you in.\n\nIf you go viral but it's all in communities that don't align with your customer profile, you're just collecting vanity metrics. I've heard good things about Community Mentions for tracking this kind of stuff across different platforms, could be worth checking out to see if your viral moments are reaching people who'd actually buy. The other piece is having systems ready before you go viral.\n\nCapture emails, have a clear CTA, make sure your site doesn't crash. The window is usualy pretty short.",

I’ve heard both ways that you always should and that you should not (since the job market is horrible). The position is an entry level role and I check all of the requirements, I’ve not incredibly overqualified but I would like to think I’m very qualified for the job. The range they gave me was a $10K difference. If they offer me the lowest possible number should I try to negotiate or just be grateful for the offer? Any insight would be appreciated. TIA",

But it's rare to find someone who seems to know what they are doing. \n\nMarketing analytics use a lot of data, but that doesn't make it scientiifc to me. \n\nMarketing research used to be closer to research and closer to science, even when that research was more qualitative than quantitative.
