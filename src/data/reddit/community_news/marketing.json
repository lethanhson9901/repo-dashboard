It’s part of how bud light screwed themselves so hard - there was nothing irreplaceable about the product itself to keep people buying it.\n\nSame for GLP-1s; it’s a wonderful drug for companies right now. Hundreds of dollars a month per customer, likely lifetime need, get them in on your brand today and watch that recurrent revenue flow. \n\n(Said as someone who doesn’t mind the occasional beer and is taking a glp-1)",

Then, meet with clients and tell them that you are starting a new guide to help both teams ensure all details are captured or put it in your submission guidelines - \n\n“Here’s a guide to utilizing this brief and AI together to debate [insert sentence about making it simplest for both of us (clearly needs better wording)]. Using this document to then copy and paste details provides and expedited process to turnaround with less work for all those involved.\n\nWith organizations busier than ever, this is a time and money saving method.”\n\nProvide what they should input for a prompt, what key information should be provided to AI to ensure it outputs, and any other key details needed. \n\n**Why do this?** Minimize waste environmentally for your org and the clowns.

      "text": "Every startup I join somehow feels more extreme than the last. I now work at a tech startup. I’m juggling an absurd amount of work, constantly context-switching, owning way too many things at once, and I’ve been overwhelmed for… honestly, about a year now. I’m exhausted and unhappy, and I’m tired of feeling like I’m always complaining about my job but I genuinely don’t know how much longer I can do this.\n\nThe thing is: I know I’m good at what I do. I work in marketing, but I’m not a deep specialist in one narrow area. Instead, I’ve done pretty much everything over the years: strategy, content, brand, PR, events, social, working with agencies and freelancers, project managing, firefighting, all of it. Mostly because I had to. I understand how long things actually take, what resources are needed, how things should be structured, and what breaks when they’re not.\n\nBut I’m so tired of doing the jobs of 10 people in environments with constant ambiguity, changing priorities, and zero follow-through from others. The “everything is urgent, everything keeps changing” culture is completely frying my brain.\n\nYesterday was kind of a breaking point. I had a meeting where I suddenly just… blanked. I was supposed to explain something fairly basic — the goal of a press release and the story behind it. But after weeks of constant story changes, lack of decisions, people not doing what we agreed on, and me juggling a million things at once, I genuinely didn’t know what to say anymore. I realized I don’t even know what our story is right now. My brain just shut down.\n\nThat scared me, because I’ve always been high-functioning and resilient. But now it feels like my brain is overloaded and I can’t structure things properly anymore.\n\nSo my question is: if I start looking for another job in marketing, what kinds of roles should I be looking for? Ones where broad experience is actually valued but where I don’t have to live in constant chaos or sacrifice my health. I don’t want to grind myself into the ground anymore. I just want a normal, sustainable workload with clearer structure.\n\nIf you’ve been through something similar or made a move out of this kind of environment, I’d really appreciate hearing what worked for you.",

We pulled the plug on the ads. I realize ads take time to really dial in, but we were far, far off the mark they promised at this point to continue.\n\nNow Ive been sent a large final bill from them.

And I want to be clear about what the promise is, how me measure performance, and how we pay for the services. \n\nFor example, sales are affected by many factors, not only advertising. If the product is bad, the price is too high, or the distribution system is not working well,  then sales can be low even with amazing ads. \n\nBasically, I expect companies to follow the brief. That's the promise, that's what they should deliver. Not sales. \n\nMaybe the company didn't sell because my creative brief is bad. But then I should improve my work. If the agency still delivered according to the brief, the agency should be paid, regardless of the sales.",

It’s also very likely the “agency” is some rinkey dink outfit because a real agency wouldn’t touch such a small account.\n\nExpecting measurable results at 20 days is nuts and naive. 30 days? Bananas. Not honoring your agreement because you didn’t read it? Typical small ball client.\n\nIt is standard practice to include a termination clause in contracts so when a client, who made a commitment, backs out without cause, they have to pay 2-3 months retainer to offset the agencies loss. If the agency is negligent, then the client pays nothing. \n\nThis is not a penalty. It is to cover the costs of disengaging and transitioning - including cancelling contracts with vendors, organizing, checking and delivering files, offsetting the loss of income from the breach, and the many additional hours put in during the first three months that are generally tracked but not billed.\n\nMany here will discount this reality because they don’t know any better but it is standard practice among established agencies. The online “get rich starting a SMMA” frauds don’t teach it so many young agencies don’t even know about the practice.\n\nWe have never had a client terminate without cause after 37 years in business until post-Covid. Amd both of them are being sued in federal court - because we honor our contracts. (both clients publicly and privately conveyed how pleased they were with our performance but just didn’t want to pay once they knew the plan worked. Ne thought they could do it in-house with a team of high school grads and drop outs and another thought they could just cancel the contract and renegotiate our fee…)\n\nWe ask one thing from clients: pay according to the terms  In return we will bend over backwards for them.\n\nBut we stay far away from people who don’t read agreements, have no ethics, are ignorant about the basics of marketing and/or don’t have the money to go to market.\n\nYou didn’t get scammed. For a couple grand you learned a bunch of valuable lessons.\n\n",

So a lot of income and room to grow and marketing opportunities.  But the job description said $65k for marketing director which seemed too low. Red flag 1. They have no linkedin profile as company. Red flag 2? No glassdoor profile so no reviews there red flag 3. So used ai to find any and found they have 2.7/5 in indeed 300+ reviews from staff.  \nThe person that interviewed me was the CMO.\n\nIdk if am walking into a trap. \n",

If a leader suggests a publication, I try to walk through audience fit, measurable outcomes, and opportunity cost compared to what’s already working. Sometimes that naturally cools the idea down without a hard no.\n\nWhen measurement is weak, I also like to position it as a test with clear expectations upfront. Budget, timeframe, and what success would realistically look like, even if it’s directional. If leadership still wants it after that, at least it’s a conscious tradeoff rather than a default yes.

Trust me I've spent SO very many hours working to convince a 60 yr old white guy client that the actual buyer they are targeting spends a lot more time with TikTok than the WSJ print edition, or that no, I don't think college football games are the best placement to reach moms buying household items.   \nYou have to make a choice, which requests are so egregious that you push back, and where can you toss them an inexpensive \"vanity buy\" (like the billboard near the CEO's house, or the inexpensive print ad they can have on their coffee table and feels so \"tangible\"), without sacrificing the actual effectiveness of your media buys overall.",

What’s worked best for me is reframing those suggestions as hypotheses instead of directives.\n\nWhen a leader brings up a channel, I’ll usually ask what problem they believe it solves and what signal we’d expect to see if it’s actually working. If we can’t define even a proxy metric, that’s usually a sign it’s more about reassurance than results.\n\nIn practice, I’ll often run small, time boxed tests or compare the suggested channel against where we’re already seeing real audience pull. Looking at where customers are already talking, asking questions, or expressing intent tends to ground those conversations. Pulling patterns from organic discussions using tools like Syndr AI has helped me show leadership where attention is actually concentrated, which makes it easier to push back on it feels visible arguments without making it personal.\n\nThat way you’re not rejecting ideas outright, you’re anchoring decisions to observable signals instead of gut feel or anecdotal exposure.",

Neither is Google ads.\n\nThe problem is your marketing -- and the fact that your marketer (and most marketers in general) don't understand the difference between buying traffic and a marketing strategy. Which leads to situations like this.... bouncing from media to media thinking none of them work.\n\nThink of it like this: Let's say you wrote a book that wasn't very good. The plot boring, characters uninteresting, and the story a jumbled mess. Barely anyone read it. And the ones who did hated it. So, how much sense would it make for you to publish the same book in a different format? Maybe an E-book? Perhaps a graphic novel or podcast series?\n\nOf course it would make no sense. A shitty story is a shitty story regardless of format.\n\nBut that's exactly what you're doing now. Your marketer wrote a shitty book and it crashed and burned on Meta. Now he's trying it on Google.\n\nGo back to the fundamentals. Create a killer offer. Figure out the best way to present it. Decide how to get eyeballs on it. Then learn how to maximize each new client's value. Get these 4 steps right (i.e. write a solid story), and you can use any traffic channel you want.",

If it was the latter, that should still have a lead (or custom) signal set up for a conversion campaign. My guess would be something was off there. Short of something completely wrong with the audience targeting (not impossible with Advantage+), Meta usually casts a wide net and reels it in as it learns.\n\nAlso, I should clarify there's nothing wrong with a PPC campaign for upper funnel if you're looking at a longer sales cycle, but it would usually be complimented by a retargeting campaign to follow those people around until you get a purchase.\n\nNot sure what your average purchase is, but I would think a regular sales campaign should at least be generating view thru purchases, which is where we circle back to my first hunch.\n\nI hope this helps a little.

      "text": "Hi everyone. I’m doing field & channel marketing for a cybersecurity vendor that sells via MSPs, and I feel like I’m a bit too deep in my own bubble right now. I joined the company a few months ago and I feel like I get too operational and I don't enjoy having 90% process-based activities.\nWould love to chat with someone who’s into B2B/ SaaS/channel or partner marketing and just… bounce ideas. No pitch, no agenda;  just a casual chat to spark some fresh, usable ideas I can try out.\nIf you’ve worked with MSPs, cybersecurity, or partner-led marketing, I would love chatting with you. \nIf you’re up for it, comment or DM.\nAppreciate it. Thanks! ",

It feels like a lot of marketers still treat display as a one size fits all channel when it probably should be approached more experimentally.\n\n For those working with content driven or publisher style projects, how are you setting expectations internally today when it comes to display performance and consistency?",

There are many more ways in which you can give an additional channel to your content. All good, but is it really just about trust over production quality? People love seeing real, unpolished content from fellow consumers. It feels more authentic, right? But what happens when the quality of the video, photo, or review is low? Does it still drive customers’ trust, or does it hurt the brand’s reputation in any way? \n\nAs a brand, should someone care about the quality of their UGC content? Before the content goes public, should they make that content presentable? I want to hear your thoughts. What’s been your experience? Does UGC succeed because of the trust it builds, or is production quality still a factor?",

The quality of the production of a movie doesn't necessarily translate into movie quality from the perspective of the audience. Something may look great for movie critics but the target audience may have different opinions about what quality means. \n\nWhen the production understands the audience, then production quality can increase quality for the audience. And that helps to increase trust. \n\nBut if production quality makes the content feel fake or disconnected from the audience, then I don't think it's good.\n\nFor example, if I'm a customer and I usually follow someone I like, and that person doesn't usually show high production quality. Then, if the production quality suddenly increases when the person talks about a brand, I probably will find that suspicious. And that can harm trust, not only for the brand but for the person I follow. \n\nThe customer should be at the center for me. And then develop good ways to communicate with the audience, including developing trust and thinking about production quality. \n\nAlso, initial trust doesn't mean long-term trust. Like other types of relationships, initial impressions matter but you probably need more to keep trust and loyalty over time.",
