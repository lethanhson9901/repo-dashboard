I've closed multiple five figure deals through cold outreach, but it requires genuine research about the company's actual pain points and a clear value proposition in the first sentence. Most people skip the research part and wonder why their open rates are trash.\n\nThis kind of approach gives all cold emailers a bad name when done properly its one of the highest ROI growth channels for B2B companies.",

It’s part of how bud light screwed themselves so hard - there was nothing irreplaceable about the product itself to keep people buying it.\n\nSame for GLP-1s; it’s a wonderful drug for companies right now. Hundreds of dollars a month per customer, likely lifetime need, get them in on your brand today and watch that recurrent revenue flow. \n\n(Said as someone who doesn’t mind the occasional beer and is taking a glp-1)",

I can’t even explain exactly why AI upsets me so much, I guess I just appreciate effort and I don’t want to see my friends and family get replaced by robots.\n\nI used to have an entire niche business writing copy for indie musicians. After AI came out, that unfortunately dried up, and I had to pursue opportunities I was far less passionate about to keep making money.\n\nNow, just this past week, I handed my boss a ten page report that I wrote myself and he told me “I don’t like it when people use ChatGPT to write such long reports. I’m not gonna read it. Next time ask it to summarize it into 150 words instead.”\n\nEvery brief I get from management is obviously written by AI. People from other departments keep forwarding me articles about how marketers who aren’t leveraging Claude Cowork are leaving money on the table.\n\nI have been sad and directionless for a long time. I used to feel like I had a purpose. Now i just feel like a vector through which AI slop is moved from point A to point B. It is soul crushing.\n\nAnyway here’s a couple em dashes for you and cheers from Vancouver — — —",

There’s little discernment or concern over reputation, it’s all about getting as much content out as possible. Quality doesn’t matter anymore and nor does strategy. I don’t even think people care about what they’re selling anymore. It feels like a casino more and more every day. ",

Management is using this as their reason for reducing staff and overhead, and tell their teams to \"use AI\" to replace the function of workers, but rarely do I hear from fellow marketers that they are getting the training and resources needed to actually use it properly.

In December, Coca-Cola release an ad made entirely by AI and were proudly telling everyone. \n\nPorsche released an animated ad that was made by humans and they were proudly telling everyone about it. \n\n  \nThe opinion was that AI ads are for poor people, and human art is for the rich. \n\n  \nMy slightly adapted opinion is that low value products and brands will create low value marketing. While high value brands will create high value marketing. Which has always been the case. \n\nThink about the days of print advertising. A full page ad in a glossy magazine was for big brands. A small ad in a tabloid newspaper was for smaller brands. \n\nI suspect the same will happen now, except nobody was claiming the tabloid ad was better then the glossy ad in the past. \n\n  \nMy other fear is that we've become so obsessed with the shortest route to profit, that we forget to provide value.

BoDs and VCs enthusiastically demand its widespread use and push it downstream and everyone has to accept the impacts. As long as something gets produced quickly, cheaply and without any human friction, what’s produced doesn’t even matter. Only output matters. There’s a strange nonchalance or even eagerness for a future where hundreds of thousands of people can’t find work, as if the social impacts are someone else’s problem. Above all, it unmasked how much people don’t care. The sloppiness of AI gives them permission to be the sloppiest version of themselves because they can just hide in the noise……..and they just don’t care.",

At first I thought it was a mistake or people not understanding how digital works, but it's happening way too often to be random.\n\nI'm trying to understand the reasoning here. If someone's scrolling Instagram on their phone, why would they screenshot your post, save it to photos, open the image, and then scan the QR code instead of just tapping a link in your bio or swiping up on a story?\n\nAnd I've seen QR codes in LinkedIn carousel posts where the caption literally has a clickable link right there. What's the logic?\n\nI run a small marketing agency and a client recently asked me to add QR codes to their social graphics. I pushed back because the workflow seems clunky, but now I'm seeing bigger brands doing it too. So either I'm missing something or everyone's collectively lost their minds.\n\nFor those of you actually using QR codes on social media and seeing results, I'd love to understand the channels you're putting them on and why those specific ones. I want to know if you're tracking scans vs regular link clicks and whether people are actually using them or just following a trend.",

The conversation went along the lines of:\n\n* \"Oh, are we printing these on a poster and/or handing them out?\"\n* \"No, we're just going to post them on LinkedIn, emailing them out, and our website.\"\n* \"Then why do we need a QR code...?  A QR code is for giving people a link when they're out in the physical world.  In the digital world--like online--they just click a link.\"\n* \"But we should have a QR code so they can scan it with their phones.\"\n* \"On their phones, they also click a link.  Do you think someone would be on their computer on LinkedIn, and then they see this, and then they pull out their phone and point it to their laptop screen to go to the website that they can just click...?  Or if they were on LinkedIn on their phone, they wouldn't just click the link right next to it, in order to get to the event site...?\n* (silence)....\"But everyone does QR codes.\"\n* \"When is the last time ***you*** scanned a QR code on your computer screen when you also had a link right next to it...?\"\n* \"Like at a restaurant to get the menu.  I just did this at lunch yesterday!\"\n* \"...because you were physically there, in the real world.  And you didn't have a hyperlink you could just click.  How else would the restaurant give you a link to an online menu?  If you googled the restaurant menu on your phone, google wouldn't give you search results in the form of a QR code.  They'd give you a link to click.  A QR code is for when you see something in real life and want to go to the associated website on your phone.\"\n* (silence)....\"But you did the QR codes for that other event.\"\n* \"Because we had physically printed banners, displays on kiosks, and little postcards.  We didn't use QR codes for the online stuff.\"\n* \"I just think we'll get a lot of people scanning the QR code.  We need to let them be able to get to the site with the info.\"\n* (facepalm)\n\nYou asked about the \"reasoning.\"  There it is.\n\nOccasionally, the QR codes for online stuff comes from reusing assets that were originally designed for print (like at a trade show, you might give them some swag and a postcard...or a banner at a booth).  But even in these cases, you typically can just turn off that layer--and I think it's usually cleaner to do so.",

The average buyer also buys more than one more brand, and for any given brand, the bulk of their buyers are light buyers (i.e most people that buy coke buy it occasionally but will also drink pepsi occasionally). \n\nResearch shows that brands grow through market penetration. Brands that have higher market penetration (i.e more buyers) also tend to have more loyal buyers. You can’t grow a brand by differentiating yourself and focusing on a narrow segment to try and form a loyal base of heavy users. Yet that is the common advice of the last 10–15 years: hyper personalization and differentiation. \n\nWhat works is creating memory structures through distinctive assets that make it easy to recall the brand in buying moments. UVPs and differentiation only work in so far as you need to have some kind of messaging. If it’s distinctive (in tone, language, etc.), people will remember it more easily.",

And the example he gaves are a bit odd. Biscuit market in a Nigeria? Or banking market in another African country.

It’s just that this is not a lever of brand growth.

          "text": "I think there are different issues here. \n\nFirst, yeah, there are brands without differentation. There are many companies that neglect different parts of marketing strategy like differentiation and positioning, and jump to promotion. \n\nBut that's far from being something to generalize. \n\nSecond, too many marketers don't see differentiation even if that's right in front of them. Maketing myopia is back in force. Too many marketers see things from a marketer's perspective but don't understand the customers' perspective. And positining is in the mind of the target audience, not in the mind of maketers. Different companies may look the same superficially if marketers take a superficial look at them. But that's not that common when we analyze them deeply, especially when we get to the customers. \n\nThird, context matters. For example, depending on the country, financial services are strongly regulated, limiting many aspects of marketing like differentiation. Commodities are undifferentiated by definition. \n\nFourth, it may be important to remember that relationships are expcted to be an important part of maketing. It's not about the product or the brand by themselves, but the relationship we develop. Retailers may sel the same product from the same brand and supplier, for example, but develop relationships in very different ways. \n\nFifth, emotions are very subjective by nature. What is a small emotional differentiation for you may mean a major differentation for the right target audience. In marketing, often small is big. We can do a lot with small emotions, we can do a lot with seconds of attention, we can do a lot without much money, we can do a lot without much people. Leveraging those small emotions can be very important for brands. \n\nUsing what we learn from books, I think it's important to understand the different levels of differentiation and not kee the analysis superficial. There are tons of sources of differentiation. Even for products, we have levels like core, actual, and augmented product. Another user mentioned some time ago about risk reduction. \n\nI recommend using marketing analytics like positioning maps. They often can reveal differentiation even when we don't see them at first.",

So literally brand differentiation as opposed to product/service differentiation.\n\nThis gets at the heart of what’s really wrong with new businesses. They don’t have a differentiation problem.

This is why brand power is becoming more important - your view/perspective. Within your category, everyone is broadly solving a similar set of problems, but how you solve them is a way to stand out. \n\nUltimately, it's about the combination of factors that you offer that will create a compelling value prop in the mind of your buyer - not just one thing.",

Differentiation should be sustainable and I think nature of differentiation is being sustainable. If you are able to sustain this upperhand like if you are able to innovate new ground breaking feature every 6 month before everyone copy from you, than this can be a differentiation. I am not familiar with B2b SaaS but what come to my mind as examples of differentiation point, it can be you be the innovator like I mentioned earlier, or you can be the cheapest like outsourcing work to third world countries but lack of some features or have low quality softwares, another differentiation can be you may not be innovator or cheapest but when you copy, you did it perfectly so it work seamless and intuitive like apple did with apple vision pro. All these have their unique value propositions and unique customers. If you argue that this is not possible or will not work I would like to hear",

Bananas. Not honoring your agreement because you didn’t read it? Typical small ball client.\n\nIt is standard practice to include a termination clause in contracts so when a client, who made a commitment, backs out without cause, they have to pay 2-3 months retainer to offset the agencies loss. If the agency is negligent, then the client pays nothing. \n\nThis is not a penalty. It is to cover the costs of disengaging and transitioning - including cancelling contracts with vendors, organizing, checking and delivering files, offsetting the loss of income from the breach, and the many additional hours put in during the first three months that are generally tracked but not billed.\n\nMany here will discount this reality because they don’t know any better but it is standard practice among established agencies. The online “get rich starting a SMMA” frauds don’t teach it so many young agencies don’t even know about the practice.\n\nWe have never had a client terminate without cause after 37 years in business until post-Covid. Amd both of them are being sued in federal court - because we honor our contracts. (both clients publicly and privately conveyed how pleased they were with our performance but just didn’t want to pay once they knew the plan worked. Ne thought they could do it in-house with a team of high school grads and drop outs and another thought they could just cancel the contract and renegotiate our fee…)\n\nWe ask one thing from clients: pay according to the terms  In return we will bend over backwards for them.\n\nBut we stay far away from people who don’t read agreements, have no ethics, are ignorant about the basics of marketing and/or don’t have the money to go to market.\n\nYou didn’t get scammed.

Note these are the minimum average numbers as they exclude suspicious traffic and only include bots we can 100% objectively prove:\n\n* Meta (Audience): 67%\n\n* Google (Display): 27%\n\n* Linked In (Audience): 24%\n\n* Microsoft (Audience): 24%\n\n* TikTok (Audience): 79%\n\nIn case you don't understand what the numbers mean, at least 79 out of 100 of the clicks on your TikTok ads (audience network) will be from bots.\n\nAs you can see, it's awful.\n\nThe ad networks are choosing to ignore this bot traffic as they earn 10s of billions from it every year.",

Not just work he assigned to me, but work that our mutual corporate overlords have included in the overall corp marketing plan and devote staff, budget and time towards executing. \n\nI did in the moment and will continue to counter his objections, which amount to “our audience is only on LinkedIn”. That’s demonstrably false. He just doesn’t understand marketing outside of endemic channels. He also has the very boomer belief that “the kids are using fb and instagram and adults are using LinkedIn”. \n\nI guess I’m just expressing the frustration of being a marketing professional working for a non-marketing professional and having to educate them on things that are understood by anyone else as inherently valuable or at least required.

Just follow what has been discussed and execute it, if execution is your thing.\n\nBut I'm from a different part of marketing. Strategy. Communication. Value. Analytics.

          "text": "This approach actually works really well but youre missing a huge opportunity if you only retarget Google clickers on LinkedIn. The real power move is running both simultaneously and using LinkedIn to target job titles that convert best from your Google data.\n\nI ran this exact strategy at my last company and found that Google searchers who also saw our LinkedIn ads had 40% higher conversion rates than Google-only traffic. The key insight was that B2B buyers research on Google but need social proof on LinkedIn to actually pull the trigger.\n\nStart both campaigns now but keep budgets low initially. Use Google to identify which companies and job titles convert, then create LinkedIn audiences based on those patterns. Way more effective than just retargeting the handful of people who clicked your Google ads.",

Sure, we had endless variations testing different colors and CTAs, but our click-through rates actually dropped 30% over 3 months. The ads looked generic and our brand voice completely disappeared.\n\nThe sweet spot Ive found is using AI for the grunt work (resizing, A/B test variations, data analysis) while keeping humans in charge of the core message and creative direction.

I'm still working through it, but since it was published in 2010, the landscape has shifted considerably. Social media, influencers, SEO, paid advertising, and channel diversification may have changed the way to think about his take.\n\nHas anyone written a well-regarded book that addresses these developments and challenges Sharp's paradigm? I'm curious whether there's a consensus work among marketing professionals that updates his theories in light of these changes.\n\nThanks !",

          "text": "I don't have a book to recommend.\n\nBut I'm now a professor after working for a long time in the industry, and my research is related to brand equity, marketing mix modeling, and double jeopardy, for example.\n\nResarch is very slow. It may take me years to publish my current research. I will take more years if someone wants to include that as part of a book. So, I don't think books are the best for that.\n\nPeople who are challenging this are usually researchers writng research papers, not books. Analyzing the edge of knowledge. Not only how the landscape changed in the past, but how the landscape may change in the future.\n\nSo, my main recommendation would be checking research papers instead of books. Especially from top journals. Journal of Marketing is more friendly to professionals. Journal of Marketing Research is better, but often more difficult. Marketing Science is excellent, but often very hard to understand. Journal of Consumer Research is good for the theoretical contributions.\n\nThere are marketing conferences, and you can network in other ways.\n\nEspecially for marketing strategy, there are many things we do that are strategic, private, confidential, and even with NDAs. So, we often don't talk about them, we don't share about them, we don't write about them. There are many things I've learned behind closed doors, as people don't want to be public about those things.\n\nSomething that I can tell you. The brands changed a lot too.\n\nCompanies like YouTube showed a very different perspective compared to before. YouTube started as a dating website, but people usually don't know that. The way YouTube and other brands grew challenged many of the concepts from before.\n\nUnderstanding the context is very important to know how brands grow. Although many fundamentals are still critical to me, the context matters and made  things like targeting and positioning even more important in my opinion.\n\nAnd be careful of things like marketing myopia and streetlight effect. Yeah, TikTok is new. But the way it works relies a lot on knowing how to deal with old customer behavior.\n\nI talked with the owner of a marketing agency recently about that. For example. Music used to be big in marketing decades ago because of jingles. Then, marketers mostly forgot about music. But TikTok's algorithm uses a lot of music. So, there are older marketers who understands more about that part of TikTok because of the fundamentals. TikTok is new, but using music in promotion is old.",

I can't remember if his book **Business Market Management** spells this out but he definitely has content that does.\n\nThere's also the research of Dr. Chernev from Kellogg showing the contexts where highlighting a specific attribute can be beneficial and differentiating. He also lays out how brands create value instead of reducing it to simply the functional value of identification. This is in his book **Strategic Brand Management**. This gives a very structured, comprehensive overview of brand management.\n\nThis research has been coming out before How Brands Grow, so it's nothing new or designed intentionally to challenge Sharp. But it shows that Sharp's \"laws\" are really quite context-dependent. They give a more nuanced picture where Sharp generalizes/simplifies.\n\nThe whole argument around penetration and light buyers will be ripped to shreds in the enterprise marketing context: e.g., look at the book from the CMO of PwC **Transforming the B2B Buyer Journey**. Or **Innovative B2B Marketing** which again does a better job laying out context than Sharp's content: e.g., differentiating between small business marketing and enterprise marketing. One is a numbers game; the other isn't. \n\n**Advertising Strategy** gives a nice look at the context behind different creative and media choices. Not sure it explicitly contradicts Sharp's work but I do recall at least one instance where it seems to.",

          "text": "Peter Fader kinda indirectly challenges some of Sharp's work in Customer Centricity. His argument is that you should focus on CLV metrics because your best customers drive a disproportionate value, while acquiring low CLV customers ends up wasting money. He uses a very similar mathematical model (NBD-Pareto vs. NBD-Dirichlet) to draw the opposite conclusion as Sharp/EB.\n\nI'm not super familiar with any works that challenge the math behind Sharp and the EB's work, but here are my personal criticisms of the NBD-Dirichlet model they base their research on.\n\n1. It assumes market stationarity. EB's work assumes long run market stability, which results in a static probability of choice between brandsNew competitors, new technology, changing tastes, new products, etc. basically anything that changes a customer's purchase propensity for a given set of brands causes the model to break down as it violates this static choice principle.\n\n2. It models customer choice as an independent process. This means that a customer's previous purchase has no bearing on their next purchase. This is a really, really, really, strong assumption when you consider things like switching costs and inter-industry preferences. If I buy an iPhone, I'm probably going to continue buying Apple devices into the future due to high switching costs. If you have subcategories within a modeled category that are differentiated, you also get problems. Take the QSR industry as an example. Under the typical assumptions of Sharp, this industry would be modeled together. However, within this industry, you have distinct subcategories that have meaningful differentiation. If I like pasta more than burgers, I may choose the noodle place more frequently because that's my taste preference, which leads to a non-independent selection process. Same idea in luxury segments of the automotive industry, private label vs brand goods in CPG etc. There's all sorts of violations of this assumption that can cause problems with the model.",

His mental availability concept still holds but the execution mechanisms have completely changed.\n\nI went through the same journey after reading Sharp and found that \"The Culture Map\" by Erin Meyer actually fills the gap better than any marketing book. Sounds weird but hear me out - Sharp assumes universal buyer behavior but modern brands succeed by understanding micro-cultures and communities. Instagram changed everything because now you can build mental availability within specific tribes rather than just broad reach.\n\nThe real evolution isnt in another marketing book though, its in understanding that brand building now happens at community level first, then scales up. Sharp was right about the science but wrong about the application layer. Most successful DTC brands I know ignore his reach obsession and focus on depth within specific communities first.",

They just meed to remind light users that they exist and keep a positive image. This can also be done badly, like when Pepsi did their Kendal Jenner protest ad.\n\nIf you want to know what’d happen if companies just stop advertising altogether, you only need to look at the tobacco history.

How much are you paying for each kind of promotion you are using, and how many eyeballs is that money getting you?\n\nPeople get so hyped up about social media and programmatic that they leave a lot of good value on the table. I presume it's not just \"spending money on billboards\" - it's spending a specific amount of money on *this* billboard - which is worth it.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is it might not be Coca Cola paying for the billboard itself - there might be a market or gas station that sells Coca Cola on the road that wants to prompt you to stop your car to get a drink, and they might partner with Coca Cola on the billboard, which gives them the benefit of brand recognition and also design resources, plus they might shoulder some of the cost.",

I can tell you from first-hand experience that the people who work in Coke marketing not only aren’t dummies, but they are some of the smartest people you may meet. They graduated from the best universities in America and were at the top of their classes. Really smart, really hard working and really knowledgeable. They could have taken a position in any consumer product company in America. Best of the best. But they chose Coke. Because they wanted to work for the best and be paid that way. Among Coke brands, they handle billions (with a b) of dollars between advertising, promotion, marketing and product development. \n\nMaybe it’s “fun” for people to pretend highly professional people are some kind of “dolts” that don’t get “what is real.” But it’s wrong and false. Those people earn six figures at Coke and, if they decided to, they could get another six-figure job in any of a hundred companies in the US. There is nobody at Coke “wasting money” on unproductive ventures. If it happened, they would be fired. No company is paying six-figures to employees to bumble around with millions of dollars on a “hunch.” Money comes in, money goes out. If that balance is in the wrong direction, heads will roll!\n\nSo, yes, they are putting up billboards to make money. They absolutely know what they are doing.",
