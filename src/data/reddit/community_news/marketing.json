It was my destiny to be in this.\n\nYet I feel my time has come for me to transition to something new, something more meaningful to me personally and to the contribution I can do to this world.\n\nStill brainstorming what that is, but I would like to ask all of you who was previously a marketer and to what industry/job have you transitioned to?\n\nWas it scary & risky?\n\nAre you happier?\n\nLet me hear your experiences or of people you know with this story.\n\nBest,",

I actually wasn't planning to move to marketing, it was the company that found me.\n\nI don't think I'll ever leave marketing again, but the reason is that marketing is so big. It always made more sense to move to different parts of marketing. \n\nI've been avoiding things like digital marketing, social media marketing or anything related to promotion for a long time, although I do have some experience with that. \n\nWhen I wanted to do something more strategic, I started doing more marketing strategy.\n\nWhen I wanted to do something more related to data, I started going more marketing analytics.\n\nLater, I wanted to do something that is closer (and more meaning) to who I am as a person, not only professionally.\n\nI got closer to entertainment marketing, like often going to Broadway when I was in New York.\n\nI expanded my international profile, getting closer to international marketing, moving to different countries and states.\n\nAnd I've been involved with other things I didn't expect, like sports marketing. I see people doing so many things in marketing. A different industry can also change the work a lot. \n\nAfter a long career, I started to think it's better to use my knowledge and experience to help the new generation. And I moved to academia. I'm still very connected to people in the industry, I'll never be a theoretical professor, but now I can help others start their careers (focused on marketing but not limited to that). \n\nSo, there are so many possibilities in marketing that I've been moving from one part of marketing to another part, but never quitting marketing. Sometimes I do get people inviting me to do something else, but I saw no reason to do that. I'd have to get an extremely good offer now to make me quit marketing, not only financially but matching my value and goals in life. \n\nWhen I choose to do something on social media or with digital marketing, it's because I have my own reasons to do it. Not because others told me to do that. They are like hobbies and side projects.",

I call bullshit, but regardless, most CEOs don't give a shit about any number that isn't revenue generating.\n\nThe farther down attribution goes the more lost the CEO is on impact you generated in that revenue. If the MQL is event stage 3 but sale is after event stage 30, you will have a hard time selling the CEO that you had impact in that sale. Get used to fighting for your value.\n\nWe talk about cost for acquisition, cost for MQL vs SQL, cost for this cost for that because CFOs run modern marketing and sales teams, not CEOs. And that's why so many companies fail.\n\nAdvertising days were simple. Spend $50,000 on a billboard and generate $150,000 in new revenue. You just made a $100,000 profit from the advertising department. That's easy for a CEO to ignore the CFO when he says \"well you don't know if they would have come in without the billboard. Maybe if we cut billboards they'll come in anyway\".\n\nAttribution has become so convoluted for most companies and everyone fights for who \"sold\" the lead that the CEO cant extrapolate on if marketing had any impact in generating that revenue from the CFO. So you get cut and nobody respects you thinking you provide tiktok dances.",

          "text": "There is not enough information in your post to provide specific advice, so I’ll explain how I see it.\n\nThere is no “sales vs marketing.” You have to sit under one function, one team. Whether you call it a go-to-market function or something else, sales and marketing are just different aspects of the same job, and everyone needs to be focused on the same goal; closed deals. Honestly, that’s the only way the fighting stops.\n\nYour goal shouldn’t be MQLs. Most likely sales are correct, a lot of your leads are shite. But also, I’ve found sales teams are incredibly bad at doing what they say they’re going to do in terms of follow-up. So there are two fixes.\n\nFirst: change the KPI you focus on.\nI barely report on MQLs. The only thing I look at is high-intent revenue opportunities — basically any lead that makes it past the first deal stage in the sales process. Once they’ve actually had a meeting with sales and sales has said, “yeah, this person could be a good fit,” that’s when I count it.\n\nAnd I don’t report that as # of leads. I report it as the dollar value of potential opportunities I’ve created for sales to close. \n\nThat’s also the easiest way to get management on side. You can apply an average contract value to those opportunities — even though you don’t know the exact deal size yet — and suddenly you have a real estimate of the pipeline marketing has generated for sales to close. At that point, it’s on sales to close it. You’ve already qualified that it’s relevant. Whether the deal falls apart or not, sales themselves have confirmed it’s a legitimate opportunity. Using the average close rate you can also estimate how much should have been closed won.\n\nThis is the only metric that really matters because it also improves your marketing effectiveness. It tells you whether the channels you’re using are producing garbage or producing quality. Right now, MQLs don’t give you any quality signal, so you either end up spending money in the wrong places or you just don’t know.\n\nSecond: alignment.\n\nYou need to be on more sales calls and more sales meetings. If they have a weekly deal review, be there. Learn what they know about the deals. Marketing’s job is not just to bring leads into the top of the funnel. It’s to help sales get deals across the line. Be methodical with follow-up. If you spend the time tracking this correctly then you can actually hold sales reps accountable for not doing their tasks. Bring it up to the Sales Manager or on weekly review meetings. It’s the team’s responsibility to keep everyone accountable.\n\nLook at sales enablement. What do they actually need? Where are deals breaking? What do they feel they’re missing? Can you create content to help — product explanations, specific demos, competitive info, whatever it is. When you do that, sales starts to feel like you’re working with them, not against them, and everyone starts pushing in the same direction.\n\nYou also need to shift your thinking from leads to accounts. Think of marketing in terms of TAM > ICP > Accounts > Contacts > Deals.\n\nHow many accounts are in your ICP?\nHow are you reaching those accounts?\nHow many contacts exist inside each account?\nHow are you reaching each of those people?\nHow many are currently engaged with by marketing?\n\nTrack engaged accounts, not just random leads popping their head up. Track contact-level engagement with campaigns. Track how many contacts are engaged per account. Then you can go to Sales and say here are x number of accounts in our ICP that we’ve engaged with in the last x days. Narrow the team’s focus on those accounts. It shows Sales leadership that marketing is working the right accounts pre any deal being created.\n\nReal attribution comes from working directly with sales. Ask “where did you hear about us?” on lead forms for sure, but what I personally do is go through every deal created and ask the sales rep where it actually came from. If they don’t know, I have them ask that question in the first meeting.",

              "text": "There is already a lot of good advice above, so I’ll just add a two key points.\n\nFirst, it sounds like there’s a significant misalignment between marketing and sales. You need a clear, shared definition of what counts as a marketing-qualified lead versus a sales-qualified lead. Once both sides agree and buy into that definition, it becomes much harder to argue over lead quality and it reduces ambiguity substantially.\n\nSecond, I’m consistently surprised by how many marketers have little real understanding of sales. A strong marketer spends time with the sales team, observes the full sales cycle, listens to customer objections, and understands the emotional impact the product or service has on the customer. You will not learn that by staying in the office. You have to be in the field with sales.\n\nThis is actually something I have used as a screening criterion when hiring for marketing roles. I ask how they interact with customers and how closely they work with the sales team. I want the marketer who stands with the sales team at the point of display if it’s a product, or sits in on pitches and listens to real conversations if its services. \n\nThat is how you learn how to market effectively to those customers. If a marketer is not doing that, then they are essentially marketing in the blind.",

The only time I’ve seen this calm down is when both sides agree in plain English what a real SQL actually is (not just a HubSpot score), then look at actual closed-won vs dead deals together and spot patterns. We also stopped reporting just “leads delivered” and started tracking the full chain, MQL to SQL, SQL to opportunity, opportunity to closed won, so you can see exactly where things fall apart instead of arguing in the abstract. The other big unlock was forcing sales to tag why leads were rejected or lost so marketing could adjust targeting instead of guessing. Most of the time the fight isn’t that leads are garbage, it’s that nobody agreed on what good looks like or where the drop-off is actually happening.",

The fix I have seen work is building a lead scoring matrix together where both sides define what makes a prospect worth pursuing, score inbound leads consistently, and review mismatches monthly. The monthly review is the key part - when sales says this lead was garbage you have data to discuss rather than finger-pointing. Takes about 3-4 months to calibrate but once it is running the blame game mostly stops because everyone agreed to the criteria upfront.",

Be willing to watch sales calls, or even talk to prospects/customers yourself. Do whatever it takes.\n\nIf you're in a B2B company, sales is king, it doesn't matter if they're shit at closing, or if it's Marketing's fault the leads don't work - at the end of the day if the company is not making money nobody has a good time.

Once you have that, introduce a lead SLA where marketing commits to volume and quality, and sales commits to logging what happened to every single lead within 48 hours because an unworked lead isn't a garbage lead, and that distinction kills the argument. Add a mandatory rejection reason field in Salesforce so you actually know why leads die rather than just that they do, ditch the separate dashboards in favour of one shared weekly view both teams look at together, and put someone in charge of the MQL-to-SQL gap specifically, because right now nobody owns that stretch of the funnel and that's exactly why everyone argues across it instead of fixing it. I hope this helps\n\n  \n\\- Harry ",

If people don’t know about the brand, it’s the smallest nudge for them to think “huh wonder what [brand] is?” And then they forget about it the moment they pass by. But eventually an ad will come up on Instagram or TikTok and they’ll think “oh I remember seeing this brand somewhere, let’s check it out” instead of ignoring it and scrolling by. If people do know about the brand, it’s a small reminder that you exist. Billboards are used to keep big brands top of mind all the time. No matter where you look, you can’t ever forget [Big Brand Here], so when you go shopping, your brain’s first thought isn’t “I need pants” it’s “I need [Big Brand].

It works when you have an acquisition tactic executed in either that same area or where the commuters passing the billboard are coming from. If digital is not the way to go, then try direct mail, or do a test between direct mail and digital.    \n    \n2. The billboard creative is too busy. When I used to manage offer and creative for billboards as part of our media buy, I asked for an approach shot for each billboard. This is a shot taken from where a driver would likely see the billboard. It enabled me to determine the right creative for where that billboard is located.    \n    \n3. For creative, you might need to stick with an outcome based tagline, picture of your most popular type of install as the background image, your logo, and company name in legible format or URL if you can't make out the logo easily.",

They create visible wins. Case studies, quick recap emails after big projects, sharing results internally so their champion looks smart. That’s what triggers “you should talk to them.”\n2. They ask at the right moment. Not randomly, but right after a measurable win or positive feedback. A simple “Is there anyone else in your network dealing with X?” goes a long way.\n\nFor us it’s been 60–70% referrals, 30–40% active marketing. The active side isn’t to replace referrals, it’s to smooth out the gaps between them.\n\nGood work compounds, but distribution still matters.

BUT, there are a few things it does well, but those things tend to cost money. \n\nYou have to just understand that LLMs will always spit out the most average based on the model and inputs. The mroe specified examples and training data you can give it, the better the output. So for all the things it does well, I have spent HOURS feeding it examples. \n\nThings it does well:   \n\\- tedious emails and responses. Especially going between languages   \n\\- script writing bot   \n\\- copy writing bot for ads and organic (always do a human edit though)   \n\\- repurposing of image assets that are based on real life - just generating stuff from nothing givces shit results   \n\\- thought organizer when I just want to word vomit and have something useful pop out\n\nThinkgs it doesn't do well:   \n\\- any data analysis. The risk of hallucinations is too great  \n\\- actual strategic thinking on any level  \n\\- fully autonmous anything   \n\\- graphic design with specifications (might not have cracked it yet)  \n\n\n\n\nHonestly, it does pretty decent work. And I have built some solid \"bots\" that help me create schemas, SEO optimizzations, parsing Google Docs into my godawful piece of shit CMS for blog posts, grammar checks, script writers, and variation builders. Main thing that you need to be able to do is break down complex tasks into step by step modules. Onyl then do these bots kinda work \n\nBut like everyone will say, without human supervision, it's hot garbage. You need to have  a brain to know how to teach it. It's basically a golden retriever with the brain of a 18 year old intern. You need to spend time training it for optimal results. ",

          "text": "More. AI to content is what the calculator is to the abacus. It just makes you faster and more efficient (especially for repetitive tasks). \n\nI'd argue that \"quality\" elements are also present - I always mistype the same words and make the same random typos, but the AI doesn't make those mistakes, so I'm actually less \"stressed\" when reviewing the copy since I know those basic mistakes won't be there. More of my attention is directed towards the storytelling bit. \n\nI'm not sure how you can produce \"better\" marketing with AI, given that the output is essentially the median of what it learned; there's no \"creativity\" per se, and I rarely see outputs that make me pause to appreciate them (they can be OK and, occasionally, good). Sure, there are exceptions, and everyone has their own definition of \"good\". \n\nAlso, if you're in B2B, there are certain ways to write certain things at all times. It's just the way it is. Many things, like success stories in specialized (and litigious) industries, have to be written a certain way (at least that's the ask from the stakeholders). AI is perfect for that type of formulaic storytelling. \n\nBut, there's the other side - AI is good at producing a lot of pure crap, and that can ALSO be good. For example, I'm writing ads - format is set, word count is set. Not that much room for creativity when each symbol counts. I have a few ideas, but I'm stuck. I ask AI to produce something, and it immediately spits out a TON of crappy options. That gives me the idea of where NOT to go with the copy. That's where creativity begins for me in these specific cases. ",

And they don't apply technology spend in AI to marketing bottlenecks to increase throughput, they just assume it's going to be a cost save and no more budget is warranted so the bottlenecks stay bottlenecks.\n\nThe actual use I get out of it is almost entirely in technology - like writing bits of code or scrubbing and summarizing documentation or offering small but noticeable improvements to specific functions. It's helpful for working with data in various ways, but only partially helpful - like it saves a *portion* of work and time, and you have to be careful not to overuse it.",

You can download all of your Facebook posts and data and it’s actually nice because it turns it into a giant scrollable file similar to the way it looks online.\n\nBottom line: you don’t have to be attached to socials personally to be good at them professionally, and if you want to offload them completely, hire someone else to take care of them and enjoy “overseeing” socials rather than participating. \n\nEdit: spelling",

In my current office the culture is amazing, everyone is incredibly flexible and there is no blame culture. I really want to try and avoid a toxic workplace if I can, but the interviews are now done and I can’t ask any more questions. \n\nThe marketing director final words to me were that she promised I would leave that job, whenever that may be, better than when I started, both as a person and as a marketer. \n\nWhat would you do?

We can talk about Maslow's Theory of Needs. Which is usually an oversimplification without context of the paper wrote.\n\nBut tapping on that doesn't happen because of any book I read. I'm basically a living example of Maslow's Needs. I was born in poverty, my father used to be homeless, I know what being hungry is, I was running away from bullets when I was a teenager. I doubt someone can learn about Needs related to physiological  or safety needs by reading a book. \n\nThere is a lot of things I've learned by traveling, meeting people, talking to them, looking them into their eyes. \n\nEven for something like System 1 and 2, I read many books, I knew a lot able theory, but I didn't really know how to tap into my own mind before learning from an experienced psychologist. We should be very careful when triggering people.\n\nHumans are not like machines with a clear way to turn them on or off. More than books, I recommend dealing with people. \n\nTo give another simple example. I did an activity with people being asked to look at each other while I played a song. At the end, I asked: do you need any data to tell me how that music triggered different people in different ways? The answer was a clear no. The look in the eyes, the smiles, the gestures, or the lack of those reactions taught them a lot. \n\nBooks often help me to understand the \"why.\" But if I want to understand \"how,\" then I prefer experience. I love being in the crowd seeing people's reactions.",

I believe it's a major accomplishment in terms of technology, engineering, and development, for example. \n\nIs it a major achievement for things that are more human and creative? I don't think so, but it may look amazing for those who never did type of work before.\n\nThe \"exponential\" improvement I've been seeing is much more technical like the size of the model and the speed of the software. It certainly looks much better for engineers. But usually still ignoring what we actually want and try to do. \n\nThe improvement may be a little late for Meta given the decline of Facebook. But, if this improvement of AI had happened years ago as you mentioned, I believe it would have improved the ability of Meta to make money from us a lot. But still don't believe it would have improved results for us that much. \n\nI think things like Advantage+ are getting worse even for those with more knowledge and experience.

When it first came out I thought it was just broad targeting repackaged, and broad targeting was something I rarely saw work unless the ad account already had thousands of conversions in it. I tested it a few times against interest targeting, didn't see much difference, and moved on.\n\n\n\nEventually I gave it another shot in some of my more active client accounts and it started outperforming everything else in certain accounts. What actually surprised me is that more recently I've seen it work in nearly brand new ad accounts too, which broad targeting almost never did. Even on very niche products where you'd think you need specific interest targeting to get results.\n\n\n\nThat said, I still don't think it's the blanket answer that Meta wants you to believe. In some ad accounts I manage, interest targeting still outperforms Advantage+ by a clear margin. Especially when the product appeals to a very specific buyer rather than a broad market.\n\n\n\nWhat I do now with every new client is launch both at the same time. One interest targeting campaign, one Advantage+, same ads in both, and let the data tell me which one that particular ad account responds to better. And even after you find a winner, that can flip. I've had accounts where Advantage+ crushed it for months and then stopped, and interest targeting came back and started pulling a 7x ROAS on day one of relaunching it.\n\n\n\nThe real answer is don't marry one approach. Test both and stay flexible because what works in an ad account shifts constantly.",

What’s worked for us is hiding discounts from high-intent traffic (fast PDP → add to cart users and branded search visitors don’t get an offer), and triggering based on behavior instead of timers. Things like deep scroll + 60s on PDP, reopening the same product twice, or checking the size guide without adding to cart are way stronger hesitation signals than basic exit intent. We also gate by cart value lower carts might get a bundle push, higher carts get free shipping instead of % off to protect margin.

Otherwise you train repeat buyers to wait.\n\nBig shift for us was this: optimize for incremental revenue, not popup CVR. High-intent users need reassurance. Fence-sitters need incentive. Treating them the same is what kills performance.",

Now I've learned to take advantage of the deals often offered by companies via email, but I don't open any newsletters regularly (despite being an avid reader and subscribing to high quality content).\n\nThe few people I know that use their email interface often beyond logistics, are 50+ years old.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\nIs it just a coincidence that I'm consistently only meeting non-email people? I do meet an unusually high number of people, but obviously it's still not a huge sample size. \n\nIs email marketing in general just for a niche type of person? Which in a world of 8 billion people, is more than enough. \n\nIs it a generational trend that will dwindle as the older population passes on or transitions to social media?\n\nWhat difference do you see in engagement for newsletters vs just basic promotional emails offering a deal? \n\nWhat trends do you expect to see in email marketing over the next 10 years?",

Most people ignore cold email.\n\n2) engagement is highly dependent on who sent it, what they sent, when they sent it, why they sent it. People engage, but differently and at different times. And it’s partly psychological. In the market for new platform X? Maybe keeping an eye even if just passively. Just signed up for platform Y? Quite likely to engage with some onboarding, activation, expansion stuff.\n\n3) We can *mostly* separate human vs machine opens at this point, so you can tell who is actually engaging and how often. But how this looks on your end really depends on how good your lists are and how good your program is.\n\n\nI could go on, but in general I both agree and disagree with your sentiment for different reasons, but based on the engagement and revenue I’ve seen from the email channel in my career, and continue to see to this day… the channel works.

We start where we know better and grow from there.\n\nEven when I work for big companies, I don't start spending money on advertising. I'm not a big fan of wasting money even when we have the money. I want to see good reasons and some evidence that the investment is worth it. That's true in general, like advertising, research, machinery, new employees, stocks, etc.\n\nIf the company can't get good results organically, for example, paying may just multiply the mistakes the company is doing organically.\n\nDifferent forms of promotion have different advantages and disadvantages. Companies often don't trust word of mouth because they can't control it. But customers often trust word of mouth better because companies can't control it.\n\nInstead of thinking of each alternative separately, it's better to me to think about the promotion mix in this case. In a way that matches my strategy and context, including your budget. Even if something is good, if that makes the company bite more than it can chew, it's not really a recommendation. I'd probably go back to improving strategy like targeting better.",

With the algorithms getting better at finding the audience based on how people engage with the ad, your creative actually IS your targeting. If your hook resonates with a specific persona, the platform is going to find more of those people.\n\nHigh volume creative testing usually beats \"perfect\" targeting settings every time. If you can test 20 different hook angles, you're basically letting the audience tell you who they are. Targeting still matters for the \"rails\" of the campaign, but the multiplier is definitely in the creative assets. ",

Most of the ecom teams I know now have almost zero targeting when it comes to media buying on Meta and about as simple as they can get it on Google / YouTube as well.\n\nThere is typically a test and a scale campaign, that's it, everything on broad. \n\nCreative does 100% of the targeting. So you still need to think about targeting but all within creative.\n\nMaybe if you're spending under 10K/day, then some media buying strategy might make you more profitable. But typically, the reason they all seem to end up with this simple approach is that it gives creative the cleanest data and that's by far the biggest lever\n\n(I'm bundling offer and funnel in with creative just because they are tested in the same way; using the creative to find the right audience for it)",

The structure and positioning take longer.\n\nWhat slowed me down in the past was defining who it was actually for. “Social media marketing” is too broad. Once you narrow it to a specific use case or maturity level, outlining gets much faster.\n\nMarketing it is a different challenge. Distribution tends to matter more than the curriculum. If you do not already have an audience or client base, expect that to take as much effort as building the course itself. I would validate demand early with a small beta before investing months into recording and polishing.",

What I thought of:\n\n* Music apps / streaming platforms\n* TV channels / content production teams\n\nBut I’m open to other creative, out-of-the-box. Any suggestions of fields that I can apply to that I might not have thought of?",

Portfolio school can really help with this, if you want to get off the build / send / post / analyse side need to show creativity in your skillset (your input on activations, video, ads etc). Another creative path in house is content/ux writing, don't need portfolio but need to show you can research, write and convert.",

As a comic book writer, as the marketing planning supervisor for a tv company, providing consultancy to artists, or doing research related to Broadway. Even as a hobby, as I have a SoundCloud channel with AI music. \n\nHowever, I'm not on the creative side. I'm on the strategic side and analytical side.\n\nFor example, artists may be very creative but don't know much about show business asa business. I like going to a concert and be together with the crowd evaluating their reactions during the show, talking to them, trying to see what we could do better.\n\nAnother example is an artist that gave me access to his Spotify channel so I could get some data there and run some marketing analytics. \n\nI've watched musicians performing to give my opinion not as artist, but simulating situations when brands might be looking to hire musicians for advertising.",
