      "text": "I’m really torn and am looking for thoughts and input! Mostly around a central question around: is my career better off staying as a generalist or getting that product marketing experience?\n\nAnd to frame it, I don't really have an end goal per se (like, I'm not set on one day becoming a CMO... I enjoy the work I do and don't necessarily want to move away from being an IC)... but I do want to move up eventually in terms of making more money.\n\n**Current role:**\n\n* Marketing Director at a \\~50-person B2B startup (marketing team of one)\n* Own everything without a marketing boss really (I report to the CEO)\n* I'm working with and experimenting with AI a TON\n* Downside: very little structure, limited mentorship, and leadership can be scattered (And I don't really agree with the direction they are taking the company and it doesn't feel very mission driven) - so really I feel like I'm losing an edge on strategic thinking. I also don't see myself moving in to anything more than director here; they are resistant to even have me hire someone under me. \n\n**New opportunity:**\n\n* Product Marketing Director at a \\~5K-person, well-established company in the same industry (like a *this will look good on my resume* company)\n* Clearly defined role within a real PMM function\n* Strong, experienced manager and department\n* More structure, clearer expectations, and the chance to specialize and sharpen PMM skills - haven't held a PMM role before and I like the idea of having that in my toolkit for future roles; I feel like they pay more and are more impactful to the organization\n* Downside: wayyy less autonomy, probably less exposure to what's latest in AI, more crossfunctional work, more meetings\n\n**Other context:**\n\n* Same salary\n* Both remote\n* Similar expected work/life balance\n\n\n\nI’ve never formally been in product marketing, and part of me thinks learning how a strong PMM org operates could be really valuable long-term. But I also worry about giving up a “Head of Marketing” path too early (I've been here for \\~1.5 years)\n\n  \nSo, this was great to write out. I have some more thoughts now that I have. But any thoughts from this group are appreciated.",

Just say that you love the team and role, and you are looking for a boost from your current compensation. And that's worth 3 years of raises anyways, and compounds if you have percentage-based bonuses. And also consider bonuses/equity/insurance costs in your calculation as well.

But at the same time, I've seen PMMs get fired before folks who run infrastructure/support basic marketing functions. Because re-hiring a PMM in the future is possible, but stopping large marketing campaigns because the \"email person\" is gone is not an option. \n\nAt the same time, the PMM toolkit is very valuable, as there's not a lot of really good, free learning on the topic. Last time I checked, about a year ago, or so, it seemed like most available courses were either too basic or too expensive. \n\nThe downside for PMMs that I've seen in larger companies is that much of their work \"dies in committees\" ... there are too many people involved in things like messaging sign-offs. A lot of it depends on the caliber of the teams PMMs interact with. Like, whether Product Managers are actually involved appropriately in collaboration and whatnot. \n\nSkillset-wise, PMM is probably the way to go for long-term career growth. \n\nBut it also depends on other factors. I used to go to a lot of interviews. Mostly as a way to gauge candidates' expectations and benchmark salary expectations. In many cases, I started to actually consider the move just because of the \"vibes\". Like, the people seemed nice, intelligent, had their shit together, etc. Some of that is intuitive. \n\nSort of unrelated, but the only career moves that worked for me were those that I made to companies with former colleagues (they'd refer me, or I'd reach out to learn about their current work and get interested). It's a solid way of learning how things really work inside the team, the dynamics, the workload, etc. \n",

Over time I moved more into an operational role across growth, performance, marketing, product, sales touchpoints, and fixing bottlenecks end-to-end. Less “marketing as a function,” more “where is revenue leaking and why.”\n\nA few thoughts based on that shift:\n\n* **Titles matter less than the surface area you own.** Being Head of Marketing / Marketing Director at a small startup *can* be a fast track, but only if you’re actually shaping the system. If you’re a team of one, firefighting channels, and leadership is resistant to leverage (hiring, tooling, process), you’ll plateau fast even if the title looks good.\n* **PMM at scale is a real skill, not a sidestep.** A strong PMM org teaches you things most early-stage roles never will: narrative discipline, launch rigor, stakeholder alignment, positioning under constraints. Those skills compound and translate well into CMO or GM roles later.\n* **The “Head of Marketing path” isn’t linear anyway.** The best growth leaders I know didn’t climb clean ladders. They zig-zagged through PMM, growth ops, revenue, lifecycle, even product. What mattered was learning how systems actually work, not protecting a title.\n* **Autonomy vs. learning is the real trade-off here.** Early-stage = autonomy, speed, chaos, shallow feedback loops. Larger org = structure, mentorship, deeper craft, slower execution. Neither is better by default. The question is: *where are you currently underdeveloped?*\n\nFrom what you wrote, it sounds like:\n\n* You already know how to operate independently\n* You’re starting to feel the ceiling of “team of one”\n* You value trajectory more than ego titles\n\nIf that’s true, a **PMM Director role at a strong company is not a step back**. It’s a sharpening move. You can always come back to a Head/VP role later with far more leverage and credibility.\n\nOne last thing: staying too long in an underpowered startup role can quietly stall you. I’ve seen that more often than people admit.",

You’re busy, but you’re not compounding. The question I’d ask myself isn’t “which title is better,” but “which role gives me better reps over the next 2–3 years?” If the PMM role gives you exposure to strong product thinking, real positioning decisions, and a functioning org to learn from, that’s usually a net win even if it looks like a lateral move on paper.",

You can also target the same region as the billboard so the two tactics are complimentary. \n\nOne recommendation if you end up going with Meta, make sure you add short answer questions to your lead gen form. Facebook loves to send you people who accidentally filled out the form. \n\nIn any case, I wouldn’t expect to see immediate returns from a billboard. Maybe after a a few weeks.",

I can promise you that Brenda from HR uses Instagram and Facebook. And that Stacy from Brand Marketing uses TikTok. \n\nBillboards for small brands are, imo, about brand awareness. If people don’t know about the brand, it’s the smallest nudge for them to think “huh wonder what [brand] is?” And then they forget about it the moment they pass by. But eventually an ad will come up on Instagram or TikTok and they’ll think “oh I remember seeing this brand somewhere, let’s check it out” instead of ignoring it and scrolling by. If people do know about the brand, it’s a small reminder that you exist. Billboards are used to keep big brands top of mind all the time. No matter where you look, you can’t ever forget [Big Brand Here], so when you go shopping, your brain’s first thought isn’t “I need pants” it’s “I need [Big Brand]. Can’t get them out of my head.”\n\nSo you can see why your billboard is clearly not working and also not going to work. Buy ads online.",

It works when you have an acquisition tactic executed in either that same area or where the commuters passing the billboard are coming from. If digital is not the way to go, then try direct mail, or do a test between direct mail and digital.    \n    \n2. The billboard creative is too busy. When I used to manage offer and creative for billboards as part of our media buy, I asked for an approach shot for each billboard. This is a shot taken from where a driver would likely see the billboard. It enabled me to determine the right creative for where that billboard is located.    \n    \n3. For creative, you might need to stick with an outcome based tagline, picture of your most popular type of install as the background image, your logo, and company name in legible format or URL if you can't make out the logo easily.",

After all the research on the current state of the app, it appears that followers don't matter and every post starts essentially from scratch, no matter your following. \n\nWhy have followers if my posts won't be shown to them? I've had multiple people DM or comment to say \"Hey! I haven't seen your posts in forever!\" Despite me posting every single day.\n\nI've tried new types of content (skits, story times, narrated process videos). I've tried 7 second long videos to two and a half minute long videos. I've tried short captions, long captions. Posting in the morning. Posting in the afternoon. Posting at 2 am. I've tried reels and carousels. One carousel got a random 50,000 views and the latest one I posted got 1,000 views.\n\nNone of it is helping and I feel like such a failure. My content has consistently held a similar vibe, no major changes but I also try to keep it fresh with new fun facts.\n\nI have no violations against my account. \n\nI solely rely on social media to market my books. I'm on YouTube, Pinterest, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram, with Insta being my biggest platform and Facebook being my best converter. (Don't even get me started on my low views on Facebook despite having 19k followers there)\n\nI've been marketing with social media so long that I don't even know how to market my novels without it, but I've been so stressed lately. It's embarrassing to have so many followers and get 20 likes on a post. \n\nI don't know what to do and the stress isn't helping.\n\nWhat I'm asking:\n\nIs Instagram working for your business? Are you generating sales and/or leads from it?\n\nAre your views similar to what they were 3 years ago? 2 years ago? Even last year?\n\nWhat platforms or strategies would you suggest for a business used to creating short form video content? \n\nThank you so much for any input. I'm at my wit's end.",

If you’re using Meta for marketing but without paying Meta, that’s always going to be more challenging. But it can still be done. \n\nI checked out your account. Your account is very niche. Basically almost all your recent posts are you doing a two person dialogue skit where you play both characters and you film with tight framing (close up of your face). And the topic is always cannibalism. Are all of your books about cannibalism? \n\nI’m not the target audience for this social media content and probably not for your books either, so I’m not sure what to suggest. I would just point out that your account is far toward the narrow-niche end of the spectrum on social media, so in other words it is polarizing. People who are very interested in cannibalism and who like watching and hearing you talk will enjoy your account, and everyone else will probably not be interested. I don’t think your account will have much general appeal outside of this niche, because you are so focused on it. This type of narrow niche can be both a good and a bad thing. If there is strong overlap between this content and the subject of your books then that is probably a good thing. \n\nThe question is, I guess, how big is this niche audience, are they finding you, do you have competitors in this niche that people currently prefer? Have google searches for your keywords (eg “cannibalism”) trended up or down over the past year? Do you have a creator account and have you noticed any trends in your metrics, for example shifting demographics? \n\nI hope this helps a little! I don’t really have advice but maybe this helps with perspective or ways to think about the issue.",

Being that I have 80k followers across my platforms, I guess I didn't really think about hitting a \"ceiling.\" I'm honestly really depressed right now (health related) and having a hard time getting in front of the camera, so the recent posts are reposts. I've had cannibalism videos get 1 million views in the past with no problem, but those type of videos don't bring in sales. My 10k - 30k view videos are most likely to bring in my target audience and potential readers it seems.   \nI'm VERY niche and that's for a reason. A romance or contemporary reader would NOT be interested in even my most popular title. My most popular title is called MUKBANG and it involves maggots, cannibalism, and slasher vibes. Hence why I create the skits I do. The idea is to draw people in with my sense of humor and the creepy facts and sell the books which have the same sense of humor and horror.   \nSo, I know you're not the target audience but I still appreciate your input, with you knowing only what you've seen: how could I broaden my niche and reach people on the fence about my content and books?  \nI've tried horror book reviews which always do awful in comparison to my skits. I've tried creepy facts that aren't necessarily cannibalism related. I've tried deep diving true crime cases.   \nThe skits and the videos where I'm speaking directly to the camera in a creepy/offputting tone generally do best. But if I could create something that maybe attracts those in the less extreme horror community, maybe I could increase my reach? ",

I understand not wanting to be in front of the camera right now. \n\nOne thing you could consider, when you’re feeling up to it, is collabing with others in the horror space? Similar creepy skit content but with another creator and you do collab posts to reach each other’s followers? This could keep things fresh and expose you to new audiences, but still stay on theme and on brand. There’s always a risk when trying new content but it’s not that big a risk if it’s another horror writer or horror actor or something. You have a big enough following and good content. You’ll be able to find good collabs. That was one thought I had. You could meet in person to film or if there is no-one in your area you could maybe do the top/bottom Zoom split screen thing. Or just get creative and film your dialogue parts separately and edit them together like you do now when you play both roles. \n\nThe other thought I mentioned in a comment below - the Threads app. Maybe you are already on Threads but I didn’t see it in your IG bio. Because you are a writer, Threads could be a good platform for you, if you have the energy for another platform. It’s linked to IG so you would likely be able to bring some of your followers over and not be starting from scratch. With your numbers, it is likely that thousands of your IG followers are already “pre-following” you on Threads. You can link between IG and Threads in the profiles so you can build your following in one place with the other.",

Instagram isn’t playing favorites if they like to they’ll see it. People keep trying to game it and hack it but it’s all interest and engagement based. You have to create content people want to share and engage with. That’s the biggest mover in the algo right now. I just had a video hit 1.5 mil views talking about how I met your mother in a video essay type way. I only have 14k followers. I constantly try different subjects and I heavily use trial reels for most reels before making them public to everyone. You might really need to stick with the one thing you’re really really good at and find different ways of making that type of content. People might like your work but they might want more expert insights and value out of you as well. Think of yourself as offering a service almost rather than just being entertainment even though the content can be entertaining. Think, does this this content teach something? Make them laugh? Is it insightful? Is it rage inducing? Try the video essay style for a while and really get used to making trial reels.",

For me, events can also be big opportunities to learn. Watch what people are doing at our booth, how they are interacting with our employees, maybe even pretent I'm a customer even people at the booth don't know me. Do something similar to learn about what other companies are doing. Walk, talk to other people at the event who don't know who I am, listen to what people are saying about us or about others. ",

Figured I’d give Google Ads a shot.\n\nStarted with performance max because AI is supposed to do the heavy lifting, right? But it just burned through cash trying to figure out what worked, spraying broad matches everywhere. Not great when you’re bootstrapped and need results immediately. Switched to search-only and things got way better, cheaper clicks, way more control. I’m sticking to exact and phrase matches for now, just to keep things tight.\n\n  \nDo you prefer Performance Max or Search-only?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c58ur06j1rlg1.png?width=1763&format=png&auto=webp&s=266de8fb4ef06c2d55e348fdd9217c45d08d1a0e\n\n",

          "text": "Don't use performance max. It guarantees you'll get fake traffic, fake leads, fake add to carts, low performing retargeting campaigns, and break data privacy laws. That's because performance max was created to sell Google's shitty inventory. I like to describe it like this:\n\n> Imagine there was a billboard company. They have billboards all over the city. Many are in abandoned industrial estates, or obscured by trees. The only \"people\" seeing these poorly-located billboards are security cameras and the occasional drunkard, lost on his way home.\n\n> The billboard company notices no one wants to advertise in the industrial estates or behind trees. That's a problem for their bottom line.\n\n> After pondering this for a few days, the billboard company's sales manager has a eureka moment:\n\n> “Let’s create a product called Billboard Max. We’ll tell our customers they don’t need to do any work and we’ll take care of the placements for them. It’ll enable us to fill all our unwanted inventory.”\n\n> Rolex comes along and signs up to the Billboard Max package, thinking the billboard company knows best, has their interests at heart, and will show their ads in prime locations.\n\n> During the campaign, some of Rolex’s ads appear in great billboard locations, but they also appear in industrial estates and behind trees, mostly seen by robotic cameras and worthless passer-by's. They get lots of leads but no one seems to answer...\n\n> That’s Performance Max.\n\nWhen you use Google Ads you should do the following:\n\n* Search only (no display or search partners)\n\n* Exact match\n\n* Loads of negative search terms (be psychotic about this)\n\n* Tight location settings (located in)\n\n* No unknown demographics\n\nIf you must use performance max then it can only be safely used with competent bot protection. That stops the bots generating fake conversions so Google will be trained to send you human traffic instead of bots.",

But the problem is the Meta Ads network is full of click fraud bots (see the average rates below), and Advantage+ exists to sell Meta's garbage inventory, so you have very little control over the signals compared to manual campaigns. In fact it guarantees lots of low quality traffic.\n\nAverage click fraud rates on the Meta Ads network for Q4 2025:\n\n* Meta (Facebook): 6%\n\n* Meta (Instagram): 38%\n\n* Meta (Audience): 67%",

Did it stop having issues from its foundation in statistics (e.g., focused on standards and averages instead of results that are the positive outliers we would like to have) and being like a black box? \n\nAI has been part of my life and work for almost ten years. I believe it's a major accomplishment in terms of technology, engineering, and development, for example. \n\nIs it a major achievement for things that are more human and creative? I don't think so, but it may look amazing for those who never did type of work before.\n\nThe \"exponential\" improvement I've been seeing is much more technical like the size of the model and the speed of the software. It certainly looks much better for engineers. But usually still ignoring what we actually want and try to do. \n\nThe improvement may be a little late for Meta given the decline of Facebook. But, if this improvement of AI had happened years ago as you mentioned, I believe it would have improved the ability of Meta to make money from us a lot. But still don't believe it would have improved results for us that much. \n\nI think things like Advantage+ are getting worse even for those with more knowledge and experience.

When it first came out I thought it was just broad targeting repackaged, and broad targeting was something I rarely saw work unless the ad account already had thousands of conversions in it. I tested it a few times against interest targeting, didn't see much difference, and moved on.\n\n\n\nEventually I gave it another shot in some of my more active client accounts and it started outperforming everything else in certain accounts. What actually surprised me is that more recently I've seen it work in nearly brand new ad accounts too, which broad targeting almost never did. Even on very niche products where you'd think you need specific interest targeting to get results.\n\n\n\nThat said, I still don't think it's the blanket answer that Meta wants you to believe. In some ad accounts I manage, interest targeting still outperforms Advantage+ by a clear margin. Especially when the product appeals to a very specific buyer rather than a broad market.\n\n\n\nWhat I do now with every new client is launch both at the same time. One interest targeting campaign, one Advantage+, same ads in both, and let the data tell me which one that particular ad account responds to better. And even after you find a winner, that can flip. I've had accounts where Advantage+ crushed it for months and then stopped, and interest targeting came back and started pulling a 7x ROAS on day one of relaunching it.\n\n\n\nThe real answer is don't marry one approach. Test both and stay flexible because what works in an ad account shifts constantly.",

The sales teams prioritize speed and revenue, creative teams prioritize ideation and R&D which takes time to do well. The more time creatives have, the better output, but the longer things take, potential revenue is reduced on the sales end. \n\nWhat I’ve found is: creatives need to outline their timelines specifically to make things, understand and respect those lead times and your creatives will be happy. Don’t talk about “can’t you make this faster? Why don’t you just have AI do that?” That’s considered disrespectful - respect the craft. The creatives know that you want things as fast as possible, and respect your grind.",

As a person who manages creative folks, there's always a stakeholder internally who drags their feet with reviews and sign offs. There's also the type of person who pushes their vision without having the knowledge or the skills. They're there to sign off, so they'll provide opinions. Are those inputs valuable? No, most of the time. But they have to be considered, deliberated, and rejected or implemented.\n\nBut it all adds up to timelines, delivery expectations, and so on.\n\nThat's why I always set extremely conservative delivery expectations to give people more time. Everyone thinks their project is a priority. But when everything is urgent, nothing is urgent. And you have 4-5 teams pecking at creatives with stuff like this all the time.\n\nLike, I'm sorry, Jeff, we slipped with your rollup for the event because designers were busy polishing a slew of decks for the whole ELT, in time for the investor meeting. A task the team wasn't aware of until two days before the meeting. In a line of urgent things, we prioritize stuff that's coming down directly from the CEO.",

Well defined goals and social skills of managers and directors can make a big difference.\n\nOtherwise, we may have all departments wanting other departments to be like them or to follow their ways, instead of working well together despite the differences. \n\nI'm not part of the creative team, but I think lots of people don't know much about their process. If I ask about things like the timeline in a way that is unrealistic or doesn't show understanding, then people certainly may feel attacked or at least misunderstood. That's not only for the creative team. \n\nIf you've worked for both, you probably should know that the urgency of one team usually is not the urgency of another team, and each team typically has enough urgent things to do without the external pressure. And yeah, urgency includes pressure.\n\nAgain, it's similar with other departments. Financial managers managing the financial teams making sense. But financial managers trying to manage the creative team like its timeline probably isn't a good idea. Similarly, why would a sales manager be the one to question the timeline of the creative team? That can easily get out of control.",

Most of our clients are B2B or tech. I feel like I'm drowning, like I'm always behind, never moving fast enough, like I'm not organized enough no matter how much I organize.\n\nMy team is good, but the personalities of our clients can be unpredictable, and there's always more demands no matter how much I reinforce agreed-upon scope, or even if we're ahead of schedule. The clients are always bottlenecking us, and then I'm in the hot seat because we're behind on projects even though I've been reminding and reminding the clients for approvals and access and whatever else we need to execute.\n\nI had this vision of working at an agency and doing all sorts of creative work (rose-colored glasses, I know), but now, by the time I actually get an opportunity to be creative, I'm too burnt out to put any passion into it. Are all agencies like this, is this agency particularly bad, or am I just not cut out for this position? It's made me start to think maybe I hate marketing altogether.",

Once you narrow it to a specific use case or maturity level, outlining gets much faster.\n\nMarketing it is a different challenge. Distribution tends to matter more than the curriculum. If you do not already have an audience or client base, expect that to take as much effort as building the course itself.

      "text": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\nMy company is changing the way they’re structuring the marketing department and adding quite a few new roles due to it. I work in paid media (think Google ads, dv360, meta) (\\~2mil/yr) and I do a lot of web work as a specialist. I have 4 years of experience (1.8 years in this role) a BS in Marketing and a MBA along with a couple of certifications (one big one in UX; that’ll come up later).\n\nOne of the roles the VP of Marketing is creating is a CRO & UX specialist role and a couple marketing high-ups have asked me if I’d be interested in that role as I kinda touch on it already. Below is a bit of the JD:\n\n\\* ﻿﻿Evaluate user journeys across key web experiences to identify usability and conversion barriers\n\n\\* ﻿﻿Develop and execute CRO testing plans in partnership with Analytics\n\n\\* ﻿﻿Define hypotheses, success metrics, and test prioritization\n\n\\* ﻿﻿Support A/B and multivariate testing of layouts, CTAs, forms, and flows\n\n\\* ﻿﻿Analyze test results and translate findings into actionable recommendations\n\nMy question is, should I stay or transition given where I’m at in my career? The CRO role will have more visibility into the work an even though I’m moving away from revenue, a lot of the initial stages of the position is building frameworks which looks better on a resume than “ran ads.” I don’t think compensation would be much different knowing my company (sitting at ab 66k rn). My end goal is definitely some marketing director/vp/cmo but I know that’s a couple decades off. Just want to make sure I’m setting myself up to not be pigeon held \n\nTLDR; what has better long term growth/earnings: Digital Marketing Specialist (programatic) or a CRO Specialist?",

But if you have to choose a starting point, CRO usually builds a deeper understanding of user psychology and data analysis that carries over into any other channel.\n\nPaid Ads teaches you how to buy attention, which is a vital skill, but CRO teaches you how to keep it. Logically, if you can fix a broken funnel, you're a hero in any agency or company because you're making every existing dollar work harder. Ad platforms change their algorithms every six months, but human psychology stays pretty consistent, so CRO is arguably the more future-proof skill set.",

In the conversation was we were talking about direct mail cold prospecting.\n\n\nThe Vendor I was speaking to said that it’s a 1 to 1 ratio Meta CPM to direct mail cpm. \n\nHe does retargeting. He’s convinced there is no sense in cold prospecting with catalogs… says Meta is more efficient.\n\nI’ve spent $12 million on a single brand the last five years on Meta. I do not agree. No I wouldn’t blast the entire nation with a catalogue. But there are certain zips in the country and certain localities that obviously are going to lend themselves to certain products. \n\n\nI started dabbling with cold catalog prospecting and I’ve had a ton of success recently. So I was looking to increase that budget and I contacted a vendor in direct mail. He unfortunately has set up his system that it’s not able to do the prospecting I want to do… so he was telling me basically that there’s no sense in it because you’re already advertising on Meta.\n\n\n\nI think in this case he’s more of a sales person than a marketer. Because that’s a huge leap in my opinion.\n\nAfter he told me he was I was wrong he then pivoted to now can I have your business in retargeting. Lol. My answer of course no because I don’t have a problem with my current re- targeting set up",

The end goal is building trust + getting reach + getting real leads + getting business. \n\nOn social media, if you are getting healthy CPMs but audiences don’t act / bother because they are too skeptical of everything they see (with all the AI slop), that COM doesn’t matter. If posts cards or a direct mail drives some trust and gets you business- then even at a higher CPM, it’s still more efficient and effective.",
