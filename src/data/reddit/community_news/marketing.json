It’s part of how bud light screwed themselves so hard - there was nothing irreplaceable about the product itself to keep people buying it.\n\nSame for GLP-1s; it’s a wonderful drug for companies right now. Hundreds of dollars a month per customer, likely lifetime need, get them in on your brand today and watch that recurrent revenue flow. \n\n(Said as someone who doesn’t mind the occasional beer and is taking a glp-1)",

Then, meet with clients and tell them that you are starting a new guide to help both teams ensure all details are captured or put it in your submission guidelines - \n\n“Here’s a guide to utilizing this brief and AI together to debate [insert sentence about making it simplest for both of us (clearly needs better wording)]. Using this document to then copy and paste details provides and expedited process to turnaround with less work for all those involved.\n\nWith organizations busier than ever, this is a time and money saving method.”\n\nProvide what they should input for a prompt, what key information should be provided to AI to ensure it outputs, and any other key details needed. \n\n**Why do this?** Minimize waste environmentally for your org and the clowns.

The average buyer also buys more than one more brand, and for any given brand, the bulk of their buyers are light buyers (i.e most people that buy coke buy it occasionally but will also drink pepsi occasionally). \n\nResearch shows that brands grow through market penetration. Brands that have higher market penetration (i.e more buyers) also tend to have more loyal buyers. You can’t grow a brand by differentiating yourself and focusing on a narrow segment to try and form a loyal base of heavy users. Yet that is the common advice of the last 10–15 years: hyper personalization and differentiation. \n\nWhat works is creating memory structures through distinctive assets that make it easy to recall the brand in buying moments. UVPs and differentiation only work in so far as you need to have some kind of messaging. If it’s distinctive (in tone, language, etc.), people will remember it more easily.",

And the example he gaves are a bit odd. Biscuit market in a Nigeria? Or banking market in another African country.

It’s just that this is not a lever of brand growth. It is useful in so far as it makes you memorable. \n\nObviously differentiation has useful applications in strategy, but at the end of the day, brands grow through market penetration and to do that you need to reach more light buyers of the category.",

          "text": "I think there are different issues here. \n\nFirst, yeah, there are brands without differentation. There are many companies that neglect different parts of marketing strategy like differentiation and positioning, and jump to promotion. \n\nBut that's far from being something to generalize. \n\nSecond, too many marketers don't see differentiation even if that's right in front of them. Maketing myopia is back in force. Too many marketers see things from a marketer's perspective but don't understand the customers' perspective. And positining is in the mind of the target audience, not in the mind of maketers. Different companies may look the same superficially if marketers take a superficial look at them. But that's not that common when we analyze them deeply, especially when we get to the customers. \n\nThird, context matters. For example, depending on the country, financial services are strongly regulated, limiting many aspects of marketing like differentiation. Commodities are undifferentiated by definition. \n\nFourth, it may be important to remember that relationships are expcted to be an important part of maketing. It's not about the product or the brand by themselves, but the relationship we develop. Retailers may sel the same product from the same brand and supplier, for example, but develop relationships in very different ways. \n\nFifth, emotions are very subjective by nature. What is a small emotional differentiation for you may mean a major differentation for the right target audience. In marketing, often small is big. We can do a lot with small emotions, we can do a lot with seconds of attention, we can do a lot without much money, we can do a lot without much people. Leveraging those small emotions can be very important for brands. \n\nUsing what we learn from books, I think it's important to understand the different levels of differentiation and not kee the analysis superficial. There are tons of sources of differentiation. Even for products, we have levels like core, actual, and augmented product. Another user mentioned some time ago about risk reduction. \n\nI recommend using marketing analytics like positioning maps. They often can reveal differentiation even when we don't see them at first.",

So literally brand differentiation as opposed to product/service differentiation.\n\nThis gets at the heart of what’s really wrong with new businesses. They don’t have a differentiation problem.

Differentiation should be sustainable and I think nature of differentiation is being sustainable. If you are able to sustain this upperhand like if you are able to innovate new ground breaking feature every 6 month before everyone copy from you, than this can be a differentiation. I am not familiar with B2b SaaS but what come to my mind as examples of differentiation point, it can be you be the innovator like I mentioned earlier, or you can be the cheapest like outsourcing work to third world countries but lack of some features or have low quality softwares, another differentiation can be you may not be innovator or cheapest but when you copy, you did it perfectly so it work seamless and intuitive like apple did with apple vision pro. All these have their unique value propositions and unique customers. If you argue that this is not possible or will not work I would like to hear",

      "text": "Every startup I join somehow feels more extreme than the last. I now work at a tech startup. I’m juggling an absurd amount of work, constantly context-switching, owning way too many things at once, and I’ve been overwhelmed for… honestly, about a year now. I’m exhausted and unhappy, and I’m tired of feeling like I’m always complaining about my job but I genuinely don’t know how much longer I can do this.\n\nThe thing is: I know I’m good at what I do. I work in marketing, but I’m not a deep specialist in one narrow area. Instead, I’ve done pretty much everything over the years: strategy, content, brand, PR, events, social, working with agencies and freelancers, project managing, firefighting, all of it. Mostly because I had to. I understand how long things actually take, what resources are needed, how things should be structured, and what breaks when they’re not.\n\nBut I’m so tired of doing the jobs of 10 people in environments with constant ambiguity, changing priorities, and zero follow-through from others. The “everything is urgent, everything keeps changing” culture is completely frying my brain.\n\nYesterday was kind of a breaking point. I had a meeting where I suddenly just… blanked. I was supposed to explain something fairly basic — the goal of a press release and the story behind it. But after weeks of constant story changes, lack of decisions, people not doing what we agreed on, and me juggling a million things at once, I genuinely didn’t know what to say anymore. I realized I don’t even know what our story is right now. My brain just shut down.\n\nThat scared me, because I’ve always been high-functioning and resilient. But now it feels like my brain is overloaded and I can’t structure things properly anymore.\n\nSo my question is: if I start looking for another job in marketing, what kinds of roles should I be looking for? Ones where broad experience is actually valued but where I don’t have to live in constant chaos or sacrifice my health. I don’t want to grind myself into the ground anymore. I just want a normal, sustainable workload with clearer structure.\n\nIf you’ve been through something similar or made a move out of this kind of environment, I’d really appreciate hearing what worked for you.",

There are a lot of variables in play, but it's entirely possible that after 1 month they are just getting enough data on Meta, or wherever you're running the ads, to really start the process of dialing in a campaign. In my experience, it is not unreasonable for it to take longer than 1 month for a campaign to become cost effective, and by pulling the plug so quickly like you did you just incinerated money. ",

Bananas. Not honoring your agreement because you didn’t read it? Typical small ball client.\n\nIt is standard practice to include a termination clause in contracts so when a client, who made a commitment, backs out without cause, they have to pay 2-3 months retainer to offset the agencies loss. If the agency is negligent, then the client pays nothing. \n\nThis is not a penalty. It is to cover the costs of disengaging and transitioning - including cancelling contracts with vendors, organizing, checking and delivering files, offsetting the loss of income from the breach, and the many additional hours put in during the first three months that are generally tracked but not billed.\n\nMany here will discount this reality because they don’t know any better but it is standard practice among established agencies. The online “get rich starting a SMMA” frauds don’t teach it so many young agencies don’t even know about the practice.\n\nWe have never had a client terminate without cause after 37 years in business until post-Covid. Amd both of them are being sued in federal court - because we honor our contracts. (both clients publicly and privately conveyed how pleased they were with our performance but just didn’t want to pay once they knew the plan worked. Ne thought they could do it in-house with a team of high school grads and drop outs and another thought they could just cancel the contract and renegotiate our fee…)\n\nWe ask one thing from clients: pay according to the terms  In return we will bend over backwards for them.\n\nBut we stay far away from people who don’t read agreements, have no ethics, are ignorant about the basics of marketing and/or don’t have the money to go to market.\n\nYou didn’t get scammed.

It feels like a lot of marketers still treat display as a one size fits all channel when it probably should be approached more experimentally.\n\n For those working with content driven or publisher style projects, how are you setting expectations internally today when it comes to display performance and consistency?",

Which leads to situations like this.... bouncing from media to media thinking none of them work.\n\nThink of it like this: Let's say you wrote a book that wasn't very good. The plot boring, characters uninteresting, and the story a jumbled mess. Barely anyone read it. And the ones who did hated it. So, how much sense would it make for you to publish the same book in a different format? Maybe an E-book? Perhaps a graphic novel or podcast series?\n\nOf course it would make no sense. A shitty story is a shitty story regardless of format.\n\nBut that's exactly what you're doing now. Your marketer wrote a shitty book and it crashed and burned on Meta. Now he's trying it on Google.\n\nGo back to the fundamentals. Create a killer offer. Figure out the best way to present it. Decide how to get eyeballs on it. Then learn how to maximize each new client's value. Get these 4 steps right (i.e. write a solid story), and you can use any traffic channel you want.",

Short of something completely wrong with the audience targeting (not impossible with Advantage+), Meta usually casts a wide net and reels it in as it learns.\n\nAlso, I should clarify there's nothing wrong with a PPC campaign for upper funnel if you're looking at a longer sales cycle, but it would usually be complimented by a retargeting campaign to follow those people around until you get a purchase.\n\nNot sure what your average purchase is, but I would think a regular sales campaign should at least be generating view thru purchases, which is where we circle back to my first hunch.\n\nI hope this helps a little.

If a leader suggests a publication, I try to walk through audience fit, measurable outcomes, and opportunity cost compared to what’s already working. Sometimes that naturally cools the idea down without a hard no.\n\nWhen measurement is weak, I also like to position it as a test with clear expectations upfront. Budget, timeframe, and what success would realistically look like, even if it’s directional. If leadership still wants it after that, at least it’s a conscious tradeoff rather than a default yes.

Trust me I've spent SO very many hours working to convince a 60 yr old white guy client that the actual buyer they are targeting spends a lot more time with TikTok than the WSJ print edition, or that no, I don't think college football games are the best placement to reach moms buying household items.   \nYou have to make a choice, which requests are so egregious that you push back, and where can you toss them an inexpensive \"vanity buy\" (like the billboard near the CEO's house, or the inexpensive print ad they can have on their coffee table and feels so \"tangible\"), without sacrificing the actual effectiveness of your media buys overall.",

If we can’t define even a proxy metric, that’s usually a sign it’s more about reassurance than results.\n\nIn practice, I’ll often run small, time boxed tests or compare the suggested channel against where we’re already seeing real audience pull. Looking at where customers are already talking, asking questions, or expressing intent tends to ground those conversations. Pulling patterns from organic discussions using tools like Syndr AI has helped me show leadership where attention is actually concentrated, which makes it easier to push back on it feels visible arguments without making it personal.\n\nThat way you’re not rejecting ideas outright, you’re anchoring decisions to observable signals instead of gut feel or anecdotal exposure.",

We literally run our own scrapes on their follower lists to flag bot patterns (generic usernames, weird geo-locations) instead of trusting their media kits.\n\nIf you aren't validating their audience data yourself (using scraping tools or 3rd party auditors), you're likely paying for 'reach' that doesn't exist.",

People love seeing real, unpolished content from fellow consumers. It feels more authentic, right? But what happens when the quality of the video, photo, or review is low? Does it still drive customers’ trust, or does it hurt the brand’s reputation in any way? \n\nAs a brand, should someone care about the quality of their UGC content? Before the content goes public, should they make that content presentable? I want to hear your thoughts. What’s been your experience?

The quality of the production of a movie doesn't necessarily translate into movie quality from the perspective of the audience. Something may look great for movie critics but the target audience may have different opinions about what quality means. \n\nWhen the production understands the audience, then production quality can increase quality for the audience. And that helps to increase trust. \n\nBut if production quality makes the content feel fake or disconnected from the audience, then I don't think it's good.\n\nFor example, if I'm a customer and I usually follow someone I like, and that person doesn't usually show high production quality. Then, if the production quality suddenly increases when the person talks about a brand, I probably will find that suspicious. And that can harm trust, not only for the brand but for the person I follow. \n\nThe customer should be at the center for me. And then develop good ways to communicate with the audience, including developing trust and thinking about production quality. \n\nAlso, initial trust doesn't mean long-term trust. Like other types of relationships, initial impressions matter but you probably need more to keep trust and loyalty over time.",
