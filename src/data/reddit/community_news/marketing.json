Our CTR dropped 40% after we switched to AI generated lifestyle shots.\n\nThe images looked fine to me. Models wearing the clothes, decent lighting, no obvious errors. But apparently Gen Z can tell.\n\nWent back to real product photos and performance recovered. Not fully but better than the AI stuff.\n\nThe report mentioned things like lighting inconsistencies and unnatural shadows. Stuff that's not obvious unless you're looking for it.\n\nAI images probably work for some audiences but not others. Older demographics might not notice or care as much.",

You don't lower your standard for quality just because the AI made it in under 10 seconds. And you don't lower your bar for quality because it's not AI.\n\nAlso, there are too many variables at play to blindly attribute a drop in CTR directly to the use of ai-generated images. You could have just as easily had the same drop with a stock image. It could have been the wrong audience, it could be bad copywriting, bad offer, etc. Unless you are running surveys to get user feedback on your ads it's hard in general to determine exactly what could be causing a dip in performance.",

Outside of that, the idea of using repetition to highlight a part that’s changed, in this case the logo, is pretty consistently a good strategy.

I think it uses this gamification approach that's well-designed to ensure that you *feel* like you're making some kind of progress or w/e, but I've never really seen anyone gain legit competency thru Duolingo alone.\n\nMy ex was Diamond level. He's one of those high verbal IQ genius types, we were both former anthro majors with an interest in linguistics. He had literally been #1 of everyone a few times.\n\nOne of the languages he was doing was French. I actually happen to speak French. (I was fluent like 15 years ago, lol. Oral comprehension is rusty rn, but I can read fluently still. Ime, they say \"use it or you lose it,\" but it actually seems to come back if you start using it again.) \n\nI was noticing he'd been doing French on Duolingo for like, probably 2 years, at least 1 year, yet hadn't really progressed in what it was teaching him. I was like \"Wait, why aren't they moving you to like, other verb tenses or something?\"\n\nI don't use the app myself (tho I've played w it a bit in the past), so this is secondhand, but it kind of struck me as some kind of infinite French 101 loop that never really seemed to change or advance much.",

Basically, they try to be as weird as possible so that people post about them on their social media. They don't need to post about it, they can just do something weird and other people will post about it. I would argue that they know what they are doing, they are a big company and they've got many talented marketers so who we are who never knew their plans to say if this is good or trash? We don't even know their marketing goals at all.",

I got let go in the spring of 2024 along with one more person and have been able to get a few interviews, but no offers yet. I’ve peeked in on them on LinkedIn every now and then and it looks like the company has contracted by about one-third since then due to people leaving and not being replaced.\n\nIt’s been an immensely frustrating job market. I was laid off in 2013 from a fairly visible role in the community, and quickly got a lot of offers for freelance or contracting work before going back to full-time five months later. I also managed to find a new role (at the agency) within three weeks of a layoff in 2022.\n\nBy contrast, this market just seems so much more competitive, with plenty of roles getting hundreds of applications. I know of two more people in my network who have also been struggling to find a role despite extensive experience and impressive resumes.\n\nMy wife works in health care and makes decent money, so thankfully we’re doing OK financially. I’ve been able to focus a bit more on child care while bringing in some money from freelancing and contract work, but am still plugging away at full-time roles that fit well. Currently in consideration for one that’s a great fit, so I’m really hopeful that will work out.",

My last job which I was at for 3 years, gave me a really bad burnout that I took a a year off just being unemployed to recover mentally. That job I was at, the company refused to hire more people, so I was doing every single task including admin and operations work, execution and strategy thinking - I was basically a one-man show.\n\nEver since that burn out, I knew I did not want to go back to the same role. I’m someone who enjoys creative marketing and in all honesty I don’t enjoy working with numbers, which I know is important to climb the Marketing career ladder. To be frank I also don’t enjoy strategy thinking but I’m excellent at executing plans or directions provided. Strategy thinking takes a toll on me mentally, as I always have this fear like I don’t know what I’m doing or what I’m doing isn’t good enough.\n\nI have been wanting to scale down to more junior Marketing roles like Marketing Coordinator where I do not need to be the one who comes up with strategy or be the decision-maker. Am I crazy for wanting this? Most people would feel like it’s such a waste for me to build up my career to this point only to go back to a junior position.\n\nDoes anyone have tips on how I can get interviews for junior Marketing roles when I’m already a Brand Manager?\n\nUpdate (adding some additional info):\n\nAfter my one year unemployment break, I did start working again in the same role (Brand Manager) at company A which basically the whole Marketing team left (I only found out during my first day) so I was a one-man show again so I left after 2 months. Then I joined company B as the same role again and realised I really do not enjoy coming up with strategies so I left after 3 months. I realised I did not solve the root cause which is that I do not want to do this role anymore which requires a lot of strategy-thinking and ownership. I’m someone who takes direction well but if you ask me to come up with the direction, I fall apart.",

      "text": "I work in B2B SaaS content marketing, and I keep seeing a big trend towards producing authentic, human, and relatable content. \n\nMany SaaS companies are trying to leverage that human touch by positioning the founder as the face of the brand. They are using their linkedin pages as channels for distributing content and ideas.\n\nPersonally, I work as a freelance content marketer, and I'm working with a client who has asked me specifically to come up with a linkedin strategy like this for their founder.\n\nBut the more I work on it and do research, the more I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle in a sea of noise. \n\nSo many companies are trying this approach, and it has led to an absolute deluge of thinly veiled \"vulnerability porn-type\" content (i.e. mistakes i made doing X) and shallow advice.\n\nI feel this effort to make content more \"human\" often feels gimmicky and fails. Can content even be considered human if there is a team of marketers and a 10-page strategy doc behind it?\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of logging onto linkedin and hearing everyone's life stories, mistakes, lessons learned, and opinions. It's human, sure. But 95% of the time, it's not interesting.\n\nIs \"human\" content really the next big thing? Or is it passing? Is human content actually what people want to see from companies (and their founders), or does that just feel gimmicky and fake?",

      "text": "I have been working in the digital marketing space for about 6-7 years now, have worked my way up to a middle management (TL) role where I still lead some projects myself, but also work on improving the team, bettering client retention and team profitability, and I just started to feel that its taking a toll on me. I keep thinking about so many different things and they are all interconnected constantly, most are reliant on other people doing their job and also some waiting, therefore I always have like 10 things in my head constantly floating until they are resolved, which brings no relief because by then something replaces them. \n\n  \nMy struggle with this is that I dont really have any anxiety about being fired or fucking up massively, I have good relationships with higher ups and I dont face the usual complaints that I hear from fellow marketers in large agencies, I honestly think that the people are alright. Its the god damn work itself, I feel like Im expected to make sure everything runs smoothly on every single project thats not even mine, and it kind of is like that because every time someone fucks up Im the one cleaning it up, trying to prevent them from getting fired but also making sure they own up and fix as much as they can etc. etc. Juggling so many work thoughts constantly, that I cant shut it off. I have to kick myself into doing most tasks because so often I have so little affect on the outcome, even on my own clients - and this is a function of being a marketer as well I think - that at the end of the day its incredibly easy and predictable marketing a good product and incredibly difficult marketing a bad product and its completely out of my hands. And trust me, I have lots of hobbies where I shut everything off in my brain, but when Im just chilling at home, all of it creeps back inside, because there is so much. I tried writing it down to have some sense of control and structure, but I just became even more anxious when I saw all the individual tasks and issues that have to get resolved.\n\nThe pay is good, the people are alright, the work conditions are amazing and I dont see leaving the company as a solution to this, but I started considering it, specifically moving to the client side to just focus on one thing and stop being so overwhelmed constantly.\n\n  \nAny of you here have a similar story? How did you resolve this? \n\n  \n",

If they start producing bad work they can be trained.\n\nBe confident and stern with yourself.",

          "text": "Not similar, but maybe the different perspective can help to think about how to resolve this.\n\nI'm a marketer, not a digital marketer. \n\nMy first official job in marketing happened because the company wanted someone to have a big impact on the outcome. The company was tired of not getting results from marketing, not understanding what was happening, and even afraid of launching new products (that could be bigger failures). \n\nSo, my main job as a marketer was to improve the outcomes. I'm mainly a marketing strategist with marketing analytics, and I had to check all parts of marketing to see what we should do. Yeah, digital marketing was included. But m work included much more than that, like product marketing, trade marketing, customer service, endomarketing, marketing research, etc. \n\nIf I saw a situation like yours, my first though would be that digital marketing is not well integrated with marketing in general. \n\nIf the company was marketing a bad product, for example, it was part of my job to find ways to fix that. Product is one of te 4Ps of the marketing mix, and a big part of the work we did. We made lots of changes in the product portfolio, and I had frequent meetings with the Product Marketers about that. However, from what you wrote, you're more operational without that strategic power. \n\nThen, you may fight against fires when they happen, but you can't do much to prevent fires from happening. And that's almost a recipe for anxiety since you see the problems but can't solve them before they happen. And marketers to me are expected to be problem solvers. If I see problems but I can't solve problems, I think there is something very wrong as a marketer. I'm not someone in promotion, I'm not someone in digital marketing, I'm a marketer. I'm expected to help solve those problems.",

I run a real estate operation, and I recently went through a period where I was dealing with team failures, and a fulfillment bottleneck where I was cleaning up everyone else's messes while my own projects stalled. I tried the write it down method, and like you, I just stared at the list and felt more anxious. You said you wrote it down to get control, but it made you anxious. That’s because you treated the list as a to do list instead of a cache clear. When you keep those \"10 interconnected things\" in your RAM, you are burning energy just trying to remember them. When you write them down and still feel anxiety, it’s because you are evaluating the list (\"Look how much I have to do\") instead of executing one item. I do something called a daily dump. You dump every single thought, fear, task, and dependency into a doc or AI. You don't look at it to judge your workload. You look at it to evict the noise from your head so you can pick one execution path. I have hundreds of pages, it's a bit emberrasing but it works for me. Being in marketing right now is a huge roller coaster, not that it wasn't before. But NOW it's like WOW. The storm is real. There really isn't so much of an answer to the anxiety, it's there to push us to think about what to do. My advice: Just keep going. Remember no matter what you chose, ask yourself... Am I being an asshole by doing this to someone? If not then do whatever you think. Good luck!",

They turned out to be informed prospects, didn't need as much education, eager to chat, cared what the product feature set was vs others. Ended up changing the nature of the conversations completely. Early adopters stand in line, they don't need education or as much onboarding. They pay higher margins but also demand more features.

They offered, I countered in an email with a 13% increase (this was way more than I would actually be worth to them, but the higher you anchor without being completely unreasonable, the higher they will likely get back to you) and stated why I was worth it. They got back with a 5% higher offer and a 3% of salary sign on bonus. \n\nI was super nervous to do it because it’s a job that I really think is a perfect fit and didn’t want to mess it up. What made me ultimately do it was I saw someone that had said “if the company cannot negotiate with you and treat you well in good faith now, they aren’t going to later either.” Which makes a lot of sense and is true in most scenarios… if they did rescind an offer over simple negotiations, they wouldn’t have treated me well later on either.",

      "text": "My specialty is content creation - photo, video, podcasts, the works. I had a lot of fun and learned a lot of skills making stuff for all sorts of clients at my previous role at a small local agency! I'd still be there if the work hadn't dried up thanks to a poor salesman/co-owner... I've been making ends meet since then doing the odd freelance job, and also working for a trading card shop.\n\nRight before the holiday, I got hired as a Social Media Manager for a high-end local hotel and restaurant group. On paper this was everything I've been trying for - great salary, good location, and a heck of a resumé builder. I was so excited to start and I'm really trying to like it, but as I see it, there's more than a few problems:\n\n- Social Media Management itself? I despise it. I like making content for the platforms and seeing their reach, but I don't use most social media myself at all. I have no interest in monitoring every post to respond to every reaction, and I don't like analyzing current best practices and optimizing strategies; I'm capable of doing it, I just find it both dull and stressful at the same time, somehow. Doesn't help that this monitoring is supposed to be done at all hours...\n\n- Getting the content made is like pulling teeth; the restaurants don't want to \"waste money\" making food I can showcase, the employees don't like being on camera, shooting (and potentially irritating) clientele is out of the question, and planning out any exceptions to these rules takes entirely too long.\n\n- The hours requirements... I might not *love* being stuck there for eight hours a day, but I could handle it if that were all. However, I've already mentioned how much waiting around there is, and on the other hand, taking any kind of true break means staying later to make up for it. So I both have no time to let my brain cells properly recharge by goofing off, and am frequently stuck just sitting around killing time (which drives my still agency-programmed brain mad).\n\n- The small things are really adding up. I've got an uncomfortable little desk four feet away from my boss in a basement two doors down from a smelly kitchen... The luxury brands I'm representing are conflicting with my own distaste for opulence... The stuffy, much older marketing team is one I can't establish any kind of rapport with... And there's been essentially no support throughout this whole thing, they just dropped a computer on the desk and said go ahead, make stuff!\n\nThe only pros of this job are that I do make good money (the main reason any friends or family I mention the problems to just dismiss them all), and I still get to make content on occasion... Everything else about it ranges from disappointing, to outright irritating and stressful; I'm dreading every moment of this job more than any single moment of any other job I've ever had.\n\n**Am I being too harsh on this experience? Will I get used to these issues in time? Or am I better off following my gut and getting out of here now, even if that means going back to the card shop and freelancing for a while until I find a role and company that's a better fit?**",

The reality of the situation not hitting the fantasy, it suckks. \n\nThere are couple of points about the actual job I'd highlight\n\n* Agency work tends to be measured, actionable and fast paced/ in house you're working on a much slower pace because it might be a question of working in a busy season vs working January - a notoriously dead period for the hospitality industry - I'd ask what the actual expections of the job is - and go from there \n*  Automate what you can in terms of monitoring, even freelance social media management and content creation - client is going to need this info  - we've all got to report \n* Make yourself a list of things to do in the morning or wider project builders - even if it's a question of brainstorming next christmas - it'll help with your brain goofing off\n* Getting content from a reluctant workforce - it's a skill - same with building rapport with an oldheaded marketing team especially if you've only recently come into the job. \n\nOverall it does sound like it's quite normal for an inhouse job, it sounds like you've only really been there for less than a month? The sensible advice would be too stick it out and see where it goes - but trust your gut it might be just be you needed this experience to realise it's not the sort of job you want but you will face similiar issues imo if you're seeking out a similiar role.",

Companies do tend to throw \"marketing\" into situations without any strategy or long-term goal. \n\nFor your next job, ask questions during the interview process or on day one like, \"What's your goal with this? If they don't have a click-through-rate goal or a something that sounds like, \"in six months we want to increase sales by 15% by sharing two posts per week targeting demographics that are in the late 20's, male, and live in a 0.8 mile radious of our location.\" then there should be a pause on the campain or stratagy to iron that out. And that might take weeks or months to figure out. Otherwise, you're just busy doing busy shit. You always shave to market to someone. Efforts need to be measured.",

It was noticeable how this type of content drove higher engagement and trust from her audience.\n\nThat experience made me think more deeply about testimonials as a core marketing asset. From what I’ve seen working in marketing, social proof plays a major role in influencing decisions, but I’m curious about your perspective.\n\nDo you think the *way* testimonials are presented (format, storytelling, authenticity, context) is just as important as the testimonial itself?  \nAnd at what point do testimonials stop being persuasive and start feeling forced or repetitive?\n\nWould love to hear real-world experiences or examples that worked (or didn’t).",

I’ve been noticing lately since the old guard of performance marketers have slowly left the company the newer performance marketers are slowly pushing the work their predecessors used to do on to the content team. \n\nAt first I was livid, because our content team has exactly 2 people and we’re already up to our necks in content related projects (SMM, Seo blog writing, email marketing, creative briefs for ads, ad copy etc), but now we’re also expected to do the ad strategies, provide insights for ours and competitor’s top performing ads (of which we have no access to stats or insights on?), as well as suggesting promos for online retail clients, and I feel like it’s crossed the line. \n\nI’m ok with contributing insights from a content perspective, or even suggesting messaging/hooks for ads content strategy, but the way the performance marketers are moving now is to just… dump everything on us? Currently they’re not providing any strategy, keywords or input on the ads (not even feedback on creatives or ad copies) they just publish, monitor and report data without including any insights, and I feel like content is being kind of shanked in the process. It’s even worse because there are 5-7 performance marketers at any given time, and yet somehow not a single one of them is free to do any kind of strategy, just execution? \n\nIt’s getting to the point where a lot of resentment is building up from the content team (admittedly just two of us) towards the performance team, and I don’t think it’s making for a very conducive work environment.\n\nTLDR; is this normal? were we just spoiled by our previous performance marketers? or are they really just taking advantage of us because our boss hadn’t said anything?",
