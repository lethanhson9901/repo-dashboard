It diminishes the work he put in and, worst case scenario, could have lost him future work with the channel if they believed it. \n\nIf a style of art isn’t your cup of tea or if you think it could be done better, that’s one thing - it doesn’t necessarily make it AI slop.

But apparently Gen Z can tell.\n\nWent back to real product photos and performance recovered. Not fully but better than the AI stuff.\n\nThe report mentioned things like lighting inconsistencies and unnatural shadows. Stuff that's not obvious unless you're looking for it.\n\nAI images probably work for some audiences but not others. Older demographics might not notice or care as much.",

The best most top level companies have just lowered themselves to what a person can do in 10 minutes. The floor has collapsed and nothing seems professional or trustworthy anymore. Input to output is horrible for AI anyways and as an animator, motion artist, tech director, the workflow BLOWS for most ads. Like 99% of it feels like tbh. It’s all so sloppy and unprofessional and I cringe at these ads now, hell I even save some for examples of what to never do and a few that make me laugh from how INSANELY obvious they are as a scam.

Outside of that, the idea of using repetition to highlight a part that’s changed, in this case the logo, is pretty consistently a good strategy.

      "text": "I’m currently a brand manager, and have been in brand management for about 6 years. My last job which I was at for 3 years, gave me a really bad burnout that I took a a year off just being unemployed to recover mentally. That job I was at, the company refused to hire more people, so I was doing every single task including admin and operations work, execution and strategy thinking - I was basically a one-man show.\n\nEver since that burn out, I knew I did not want to go back to the same role. I’m someone who enjoys creative marketing and in all honesty I don’t enjoy working with numbers, which I know is important to climb the Marketing career ladder. To be frank I also don’t enjoy strategy thinking but I’m excellent at executing plans or directions provided. Strategy thinking takes a toll on me mentally, as I always have this fear like I don’t know what I’m doing or what I’m doing isn’t good enough.\n\nI have been wanting to scale down to more junior Marketing roles like Marketing Coordinator where I do not need to be the one who comes up with strategy or be the decision-maker. Am I crazy for wanting this? Most people would feel like it’s such a waste for me to build up my career to this point only to go back to a junior position.\n\nDoes anyone have tips on how I can get interviews for junior Marketing roles when I’m already a Brand Manager?\n\nUpdate (adding some additional info):\n\nAfter my one year unemployment break, I did start working again in the same role (Brand Manager) at company A which basically the whole Marketing team left (I only found out during my first day) so I was a one-man show again so I left after 2 months. Then I joined company B as the same role again and realised I really do not enjoy coming up with strategies so I left after 3 months. I realised I did not solve the root cause which is that I do not want to do this role anymore which requires a lot of strategy-thinking and ownership. I’m someone who takes direction well but if you ask me to come up with the direction, I fall apart.",

          "text": "From what I saw, sales orientation and product orientation were back in force in the last ten years or so. With aggressive approaches back, with marketing myopia back, law of the instrument back, streetlight effect back, etc. Tons of things that I expected to be in the past became the norm now. Social media became antisocial. Email marketing became spam. \n\nSo, marketing moved backwards. Marketing now often looks like the marketing from before I started my career more than 30 years ago in term of philosophy even if the technology is modern. \n\nIt became harder to find companies that are marketing orientated. It became harder to find marketers who actually know the market. Marketers often know about product, design, or media more than they know about the market (customers and competitors). \n\nWhen I hire marketers, I see that very few job applicants can tell me about segmentation, even thought segmentation is the beginning of the principles of marketing, even before the 4Ps. Basics of the basics. But, when I ask about segmentation, they give me a target. They talk about targeting, not segmentation. It's so common that AI does the same thing, gives a target. Job applicants often can't tell me the difference between segmentation and targeting.\n\nPositioning and value are also part of the basics that have been mostly forgotten. Positioning is about the customers' minds. But, since current marketers don't know much about customers, they tell me what in the companies minds instead of the customers'. About value, even here there are users insisting that value, sales, revenue, profit and cash generation are all the same thing.\n\nBut the reasons to move to marketing orientation are still valid. So, marketing orientation will return. Being an old marketer with the marketing orientation mindset has been helping me to have a competitive advantage actually since other job seekers are closer to sales orientation and product orientation. \n\nOther parts of marketing are also returning. \n\nIMC was very important when I started my career. Then, it seems people forgot about that. Now, I see people worried again about having one voice in the sea of noise.\n\nMusic is another example. Music used to be something big in the old days with things like jingles. Later, music became a smaller detail. Now, marketers who know about music can make a difference, especially with platforms like TikTok. And I see things on TikTok that reminds me of decades ago.",

There's a reason in-person marketing has been such a bit the past few years, IMO.\n\nHow do you define/separate segmentation and targeting? What's IMC?",

                  "text": "Segmentation is about defining the way to divide the market. For example, does it help if I break the market down by gender or not? Does it help if I break the market down by country or not? Does it help if I break the market down by lifestyle or not? Does it help if I break the market down by musical taste or not? So on and so forth. Finding unexpected ways to break the market down instead of just using age, gender, country of other typical segmentation variables can allow us to understand the market in a way that others don't. And that is the foundation to target better, develop better marketing actions. \n\nAFTER we define segmentation, we do targeting. We select our targets based on the segmentation strategy.\n\nIf, during segmentation, we defined that breaking the market down by age helps us, we may need to think of ways to target based on that. Maybe target Gen X or Millennials? Maybe target those btween 18 and 30? Maybe target those born after 2000? Something related to age since we found out that age is relevant.\n\nBut, if our segmentation strategy concluded that age is not important for our business, then we shoudn't be thinking of Gen X, Millenials, 18-30, after 2000 or things related to age. We should target based on segmentation. \n\nSo, when I ask about Segmentation and the job applicant says they would target Millennials, target females, target Americans, target social media users, target keywords related to the product or something like that, that's targeting. They already selected the target. They are not talking about whether we should segment by that. \n\nIt's very common for job applicants to target social media users without being able to explain whether breaking the market down based on social media is the right segmentation strategy. \n\nThere is a lot to talk about segmentation and targeting. For example, use of clustering from data analytics to develop the segmentation strategy with marketing analytics. Or the different types of targeting strategies (I often recommend concentrated targeting strategies as the starting point). But those things are more advanced, I think it's still ok if marketers don't know them. But, when they don't even know what segmention is, there is no point teaching them about using clustering for segmentation.\n\nIMC is Integrated Marketing Communication. \n\nAround the 80s, marketers noticed that different parts of marketing communication were saying different things. If you checked advertising, PR, and salespeople, they could say very different things, often against each other. So, the company's marketing communication added to the noise, it was very confusing. Customers might see and, then go to the store to talk to a salesperson and get a very different story. Or they could check the news and get something different. \n\nThat's basically how IMC started. To have all the different parts of the Promotion Mix (advertising, public relations, sales promotion, personal selling) working together, integrating them. \n\nNow, companies are struggling to integrate marketing communication through their multiple social media accounts, their websites, their stores, their press releases, etc. For example, we may see cases when the brand looks modern on one social media account, oudated on another social media account, and prehistoric in the real world. \n\nSo I see some people taking about IMC again to make them all work together.",

      "text": "Recently laid off 40 yr old here, with about 12 years of experience in B2B content marketing and business dev. I feel like my skillset can easily be matched by any driven 23-year-old, or even AI. I feel so generic and replaceable.\n\nSo I'm rethinking my next move. One option I’m considering is adding more hard or adjacent skills, like PPC / paid search, and going further into data-driven marketing by learning tools like Power BI. The idea is to stop being a generic content marketer and bring something more concrete to the table.\n\nAnother path I’m considering is specialization. I’ve worked across very different industries: events, real estate, retail, printing, and SaaS. But now I think I can contribute a lot in the medical field? Possibly pharma, but medical device feel like an especially strong fit.\n\nI’ve been deeply involved in managing my aging parents’ healthcare, to the point where I’m very fluent in medical terms. During consultations, doctors often assume I have a medical background. I genuinely understand the pulmonology space, and I can see clear gaps in how certain products like BiPAP machines are explained and marketed to end users. I feel like I’d actually be good at this.\n\nWhat do you think? Will targeting and eventually specializing in an industry like medical devices/pharma increase my value in the job market? I know it would take a lot of work and networking to get into such a regulated industry. Or would I see more ROI by strengthening my technical skills and staying flexible about the industry I apply them in?",

That brings immediately marketable value if you're looking to pay the bills. \n\nBest of luck.",

That's why they go to influencers and content creators. \n\nIf you were to build an YouTube channel, grab emails, or write articles on a topic you are interested in that would be good.

There aren't many jobs, and the jobs that exist often are not out there in the open.\n\nI mentioned here that, for my first official job in marketing (a marketing planning supervisor), I didn't apply for the job. The company found me instead. \n\nWhen I became a director, it wasn't because I applied to a job ad either. I was helping someone as a consultant, he started to trust my work over time, until he told me of an opportunity he knew.\n\nNetworking has been very important to me to get jobs.\n\nAlso, I don't think about finding many generalist roles. I think about getting the one right role, not only as a generalist but in terms of values and goals. \n\nFor example, I'm not someone digital. Yeah, I worked with social media even before people called that social media. AI has been part of my life for about ten years. I do a lot of marketing analytics. However, as a generalist, I'm more general than digital, I'm real too. I've been avoiding specializing on digital, technology or something like that for many years, although I received offers for that type of role. I want the real world too.  \n\nSpecialized roles tend to be more operational, and easier to check in terms of more technical skills. However, for my jobs, things like soft skills, trust, commitment, and working with teams weree very important and hard to evaluate through traditional hiring processes. So, we relied a lot on recommendations from people we trust.",

This started before AI keep in mind. When you have ‘dumbed down’ creative software tools, websites, everything is plug and play, barely any print production anymorre, copy and releases are spit out in 30 sec. and I needed final art or something in vector maybe 3 times all of last year. I outsourced to a videographer once last summer.  🤷🏽 \nHate to say it but I don’t expect to need a specialist FTE for at least 12 mos. Maybe more. I don’t have enough work to fill up a week’s hours for a developer or designer or writer.  It’s very different. If I do have a need I’ll pay contractors.",

                  "text": "Good questions. We do a steady mix of consulting and content creation for a niche market. The actual marketing work is just that. Work. But I enjoy the discovery phase of working with a new customer, seeing how they approach things, understanding their pain points, trying to work out ways we can help. It's is enjoyable and rewarding to do work that you know moves the needle for someone else. A lot of times we end up solving problems for customers that they didn't even know they had. I also enjoy running my own business and working on our own strategy, though it can be quite stressful at times.\n\nI don't think agencies or agency owners are any more trustworthy/untrustworthy than any other kind of business or business person. There are bad apples, sure, but most people want to do good work and build their reputation to grow their business.  The issue that a lot of agencies have is capacity. In order to be profitable, you need to maximize your capacity. That's obvious. But what if a contract demands a little bit more capacity than you have but is not quite valuable enough to add headcount (thus increasing capacity)? Deliveries might suffer, or you get burnt out. Or both.\n\nThis capacity problem is true of every business, by the way. But I think it's probably more acute for small agencies, where every new hire represents a huge investment compared to their overall revenue.\n\nUnfortunately, once you solve this challenge, the other big challenge is not far away:  finding more customers.\n\n\\*\\*Edited to add first line for more context.",

They are using their linkedin pages as channels for distributing content and ideas.\n\nPersonally, I work as a freelance content marketer, and I'm working with a client who has asked me specifically to come up with a linkedin strategy like this for their founder.\n\nBut the more I work on it and do research, the more I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle in a sea of noise. \n\nSo many companies are trying this approach, and it has led to an absolute deluge of thinly veiled \"vulnerability porn-type\" content (i.e. mistakes i made doing X) and shallow advice.\n\nI feel this effort to make content more \"human\" often feels gimmicky and fails. Can content even be considered human if there is a team of marketers and a 10-page strategy doc behind it?\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of logging onto linkedin and hearing everyone's life stories, mistakes, lessons learned, and opinions. It's human, sure. But 95% of the time, it's not interesting.\n\nIs \"human\" content really the next big thing? Or is it passing? Is human content actually what people want to see from companies (and their founders), or does that just feel gimmicky and fake?",

I keep thinking about so many different things and they are all interconnected constantly, most are reliant on other people doing their job and also some waiting, therefore I always have like 10 things in my head constantly floating until they are resolved, which brings no relief because by then something replaces them. \n\n  \nMy struggle with this is that I dont really have any anxiety about being fired or fucking up massively, I have good relationships with higher ups and I dont face the usual complaints that I hear from fellow marketers in large agencies, I honestly think that the people are alright. Its the god damn work itself, I feel like Im expected to make sure everything runs smoothly on every single project thats not even mine, and it kind of is like that because every time someone fucks up Im the one cleaning it up, trying to prevent them from getting fired but also making sure they own up and fix as much as they can etc. etc. Juggling so many work thoughts constantly, that I cant shut it off. I have to kick myself into doing most tasks because so often I have so little affect on the outcome, even on my own clients - and this is a function of being a marketer as well I think - that at the end of the day its incredibly easy and predictable marketing a good product and incredibly difficult marketing a bad product and its completely out of my hands. And trust me, I have lots of hobbies where I shut everything off in my brain, but when Im just chilling at home, all of it creeps back inside, because there is so much. I tried writing it down to have some sense of control and structure, but I just became even more anxious when I saw all the individual tasks and issues that have to get resolved.\n\nThe pay is good, the people are alright, the work conditions are amazing and I dont see leaving the company as a solution to this, but I started considering it, specifically moving to the client side to just focus on one thing and stop being so overwhelmed constantly.\n\n  \nAny of you here have a similar story? How did you resolve this? \n\n  \n",

If they start producing bad work they can be trained.\n\nBe confident and stern with yourself.",

          "text": "Not similar, but maybe the different perspective can help to think about how to resolve this.\n\nI'm a marketer, not a digital marketer. \n\nMy first official job in marketing happened because the company wanted someone to have a big impact on the outcome. The company was tired of not getting results from marketing, not understanding what was happening, and even afraid of launching new products (that could be bigger failures). \n\nSo, my main job as a marketer was to improve the outcomes. I'm mainly a marketing strategist with marketing analytics, and I had to check all parts of marketing to see what we should do. Yeah, digital marketing was included. But m work included much more than that, like product marketing, trade marketing, customer service, endomarketing, marketing research, etc. \n\nIf I saw a situation like yours, my first though would be that digital marketing is not well integrated with marketing in general. \n\nIf the company was marketing a bad product, for example, it was part of my job to find ways to fix that. Product is one of te 4Ps of the marketing mix, and a big part of the work we did. We made lots of changes in the product portfolio, and I had frequent meetings with the Product Marketers about that. However, from what you wrote, you're more operational without that strategic power. \n\nThen, you may fight against fires when they happen, but you can't do much to prevent fires from happening. And that's almost a recipe for anxiety since you see the problems but can't solve them before they happen. And marketers to me are expected to be problem solvers. If I see problems but I can't solve problems, I think there is something very wrong as a marketer. I'm not someone in promotion, I'm not someone in digital marketing, I'm a marketer. I'm expected to help solve those problems.",

I run a real estate operation, and I recently went through a period where I was dealing with team failures, and a fulfillment bottleneck where I was cleaning up everyone else's messes while my own projects stalled. I tried the write it down method, and like you, I just stared at the list and felt more anxious. You said you wrote it down to get control, but it made you anxious. That’s because you treated the list as a to do list instead of a cache clear. When you keep those \"10 interconnected things\" in your RAM, you are burning energy just trying to remember them. When you write them down and still feel anxiety, it’s because you are evaluating the list (\"Look how much I have to do\") instead of executing one item. I do something called a daily dump. You dump every single thought, fear, task, and dependency into a doc or AI. You don't look at it to judge your workload. You look at it to evict the noise from your head so you can pick one execution path. I have hundreds of pages, it's a bit emberrasing but it works for me. Being in marketing right now is a huge roller coaster, not that it wasn't before. But NOW it's like WOW. The storm is real. There really isn't so much of an answer to the anxiety, it's there to push us to think about what to do. My advice: Just keep going. Remember no matter what you chose, ask yourself... Am I being an asshole by doing this to someone? If not then do whatever you think. Good luck!",

It was noticeable how this type of content drove higher engagement and trust from her audience.\n\nThat experience made me think more deeply about testimonials as a core marketing asset. From what I’ve seen working in marketing, social proof plays a major role in influencing decisions, but I’m curious about your perspective.\n\nDo you think the *way* testimonials are presented (format, storytelling, authenticity, context) is just as important as the testimonial itself?  \nAnd at what point do testimonials stop being persuasive and start feeling forced or repetitive?\n\nWould love to hear real-world experiences or examples that worked (or didn’t).",

I’ve been noticing lately since the old guard of performance marketers have slowly left the company the newer performance marketers are slowly pushing the work their predecessors used to do on to the content team. \n\nAt first I was livid, because our content team has exactly 2 people and we’re already up to our necks in content related projects (SMM, Seo blog writing, email marketing, creative briefs for ads, ad copy etc), but now we’re also expected to do the ad strategies, provide insights for ours and competitor’s top performing ads (of which we have no access to stats or insights on?), as well as suggesting promos for online retail clients, and I feel like it’s crossed the line. \n\nI’m ok with contributing insights from a content perspective, or even suggesting messaging/hooks for ads content strategy, but the way the performance marketers are moving now is to just… dump everything on us? Currently they’re not providing any strategy, keywords or input on the ads (not even feedback on creatives or ad copies) they just publish, monitor and report data without including any insights, and I feel like content is being kind of shanked in the process. It’s even worse because there are 5-7 performance marketers at any given time, and yet somehow not a single one of them is free to do any kind of strategy, just execution? \n\nIt’s getting to the point where a lot of resentment is building up from the content team (admittedly just two of us) towards the performance team, and I don’t think it’s making for a very conducive work environment.\n\nTLDR; is this normal? were we just spoiled by our previous performance marketers? or are they really just taking advantage of us because our boss hadn’t said anything?",

      "text": "My specialty is content creation - photo, video, podcasts, the works. I had a lot of fun and learned a lot of skills making stuff for all sorts of clients at my previous role at a small local agency! I'd still be there if the work hadn't dried up thanks to a poor salesman/co-owner... I've been making ends meet since then doing the odd freelance job, and also working for a trading card shop.\n\nRight before the holiday, I got hired as a Social Media Manager for a high-end local hotel and restaurant group. On paper this was everything I've been trying for - great salary, good location, and a heck of a resumé builder. I was so excited to start and I'm really trying to like it, but as I see it, there's more than a few problems:\n\n- Social Media Management itself? I despise it. I like making content for the platforms and seeing their reach, but I don't use most social media myself at all. I have no interest in monitoring every post to respond to every reaction, and I don't like analyzing current best practices and optimizing strategies; I'm capable of doing it, I just find it both dull and stressful at the same time, somehow. Doesn't help that this monitoring is supposed to be done at all hours...\n\n- Getting the content made is like pulling teeth; the restaurants don't want to \"waste money\" making food I can showcase, the employees don't like being on camera, shooting (and potentially irritating) clientele is out of the question, and planning out any exceptions to these rules takes entirely too long.\n\n- The hours requirements... I might not *love* being stuck there for eight hours a day, but I could handle it if that were all. However, I've already mentioned how much waiting around there is, and on the other hand, taking any kind of true break means staying later to make up for it. So I both have no time to let my brain cells properly recharge by goofing off, and am frequently stuck just sitting around killing time (which drives my still agency-programmed brain mad).\n\n- The small things are really adding up. I've got an uncomfortable little desk four feet away from my boss in a basement two doors down from a smelly kitchen... The luxury brands I'm representing are conflicting with my own distaste for opulence... The stuffy, much older marketing team is one I can't establish any kind of rapport with... And there's been essentially no support throughout this whole thing, they just dropped a computer on the desk and said go ahead, make stuff!\n\nThe only pros of this job are that I do make good money (the main reason any friends or family I mention the problems to just dismiss them all), and I still get to make content on occasion... Everything else about it ranges from disappointing, to outright irritating and stressful; I'm dreading every moment of this job more than any single moment of any other job I've ever had.\n\n**Am I being too harsh on this experience? Will I get used to these issues in time? Or am I better off following my gut and getting out of here now, even if that means going back to the card shop and freelancing for a while until I find a role and company that's a better fit?**",

The reality of the situation not hitting the fantasy, it suckks. \n\nThere are couple of points about the actual job I'd highlight\n\n* Agency work tends to be measured, actionable and fast paced/ in house you're working on a much slower pace because it might be a question of working in a busy season vs working January - a notoriously dead period for the hospitality industry - I'd ask what the actual expections of the job is - and go from there \n*  Automate what you can in terms of monitoring, even freelance social media management and content creation - client is going to need this info  - we've all got to report \n* Make yourself a list of things to do in the morning or wider project builders - even if it's a question of brainstorming next christmas - it'll help with your brain goofing off\n* Getting content from a reluctant workforce - it's a skill - same with building rapport with an oldheaded marketing team especially if you've only recently come into the job. \n\nOverall it does sound like it's quite normal for an inhouse job, it sounds like you've only really been there for less than a month? The sensible advice would be too stick it out and see where it goes - but trust your gut it might be just be you needed this experience to realise it's not the sort of job you want but you will face similiar issues imo if you're seeking out a similiar role.",

If there's proof that it's only to say 10% of your annual revenue, then IG should get around 10% of your effort. Do this down the line. If there isn't a way to measure the proof for these social channels, then someone above you needs to put that in place ASAP.

Looking good matters there. \n\nTikTok was basically created for amateurs, people who have something to say but don't have a nice camera, don't have the proper equipment, etc. But, with TikTok, they can use whatever they have and post whatever they can, even if it doesn't look professional. \n\nReddit is one of the oldest social media platforms still alive, and still has the vibe of the old online forums, that don't like something very commercial and are more about developing relationships and contributing.\n\nAgain, if those things match my brand and purpose, and my audience is there, that makes sense.\n\nIf I have data, I can use marketing analytics to look for my evidence to justify my starting strategy. If not, I may conduct some marketing research.",
