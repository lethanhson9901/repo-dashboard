And that can lead to a much higher income.\n\n\\- Marketing analytics with data analytics, statistics, coding. Analytics can be very helpful to see what others are not seeing, develop better strategies, get stronger evidence to make better decisions, and get better results. Then, higher income is expected.\n\nI remember what someone told me once. If I want more more, I shold be closer to the money. If I'm far from the money, just following orders instead of making decisions, then it's hard to expect others to decide to give me more money. \n\nBut there are some important details. \n\nThis isn't a straight line. I did make less money for a time until I started to make much more money. I had to invest first to have return later.\n\nSome factors were extremely helpful in unexpected ways. Since I'm more of a generalist, I was criticized for spreading myself too thin or doing too many things that were irrelevant. A big example to me is AI. About 10 years ago, almost nobody in marketing cared about AI. And I was talking about AI because of my interest in games with the AlphaGo project. Now, my skills related to AI are very important, and people in marketing don't think they are irrelevant anymore. ",

Fortune 500 brands, global agencies, I have seen many fail here.  If you can't define what \"is\" is, then improvement is impossible. If you don't fully understand or are working off of erred info, your actions will be misdirected. Becoming extremely curious about data, finding where the dots connect and identifying when metrics and data are not making sense (not taking it at face value) is a skillet I see rarely. I was a math major before I flipped to marketing so I had a leg up. You do not have to be a math major to question findings and pursue real understanding. And, you can always hire analytics people who think more like business people and can help in the pursuit of truth vs justification of efforts.",

There are legal cases (people suing others) where one side needs an expert witness in the case that has marketing experience. \n\nIt’s not necessarily a marketing skill, it’s the marketing experience, as well as the ability to write great expert witness reports. I can tell you that it’s not for everyone, especially when you’re deposed and then need to testify at trial. For income, I can charge whatever I want. Marketing related expert witness charge $300-1200 per hour, with most cases being 10-50 hours of work. \n\nFor skills, it’s not necessarily one or the other skill. It’s the fact that you’re someone who specializes in that skill. For example, I know a guy who specializes in analytics. He’s the absolute best one out there, and gets plenty of work as he’s known as someone who is the best out there at analytics. \n\nThe skill doesn’t matter, it’s the passion you have for that skill.

I soon built up great relationship with our sales team and then later with our product development team.  \n\n  \nOne time we lost a deal to a small competitor.  I was able to find a picture of their headquarters which was literally in a strip mall above a pizza shop.  We were able to get the deal back mainly because Cigna thought they were dealing with a bigger company.     I am in my CEOs office about 6 months later and he had my picture of the pizza shop framed and put on his mantle.    I was gold after that.",

I do not know how to parse this type of ask to be honest. We are not a unique industry, we aren't going to create some insane distinguished value prop. But what we do have is an enormous gap and opportunity to do things correctly on the website and enjoy the results of that, and against competition that is middle of the road.  \n  \nAll the meetings I am in, anytime an idea comes up, the c-suite marketers just say \"I need you to zoom out.\" \n\nI'm trying to put together a deck of the base reasons my task items need to happen, but it's so bizarre to me that they need to be explained from such a high level. I am rethinking if I want to be at this level in my career at all.\n\nMaybe I'm just venting about having to make decks haha, but curious as to how others took the leap in their career at this point.

Start there. \n\nThis post itself provides a clear roadmap of where and how you should reframe your thinking if you want to accomplish. Don't think of it as \"what we need to execute\". That is sausage-making, as they say. You have your team to discuss those particulars with. Instead, focus on the *why* you need to execute. What are we looking to accomplish? Why is that important? Dumb it down, but root it in facts and figures. Anchor these whys in core business objectives.\n\nIf you're working on a UX project, for example, frame it as \"Improving onsite/in app efficiency/usablility to increase ROI with no change in marketing spend\" rather than a specific explaining what the actual improvement is.\n\nFocus on the destination, not the journey.",

What’s your category? What’s happening to it - risks, challenges, headwinds, tailwinds. What’s the opportunity? Then craft a statement, an articulation that provides a strategic north star (e.g. “Let our users do the talking”). Then you can hone in on how your department/team can help achieve that tactically (e.g put users at the center of our creative). \n\nThere are tons of frameworks to visualize strategy, like flywheels, positioning maps, anything on a x/y axis format, today/tomorrow, “from: X to Z; Y to W” etc. pick the one you think best illustrates the direction you have in mind.\n\nAlso ask why several times against your tactics. We need to improve X metric. Why? X5. This is a nice way of getting closer to big picture thinking. \n\nIn my experience, execs prefer strategy over tactics because strategy is usually something they can grasp even if they don’t have in depth know how of a particular channel (e.g social media), so you can get their buy in at the strategic level, and they leave the tactics to you/specialists.

I've had total visibility of how the start-up is run, being really close to management. But my job? Making content, writing pitch decks, some targeted campaigns, designing brand kit, some CRM implementation, ...\n\nAs I've never had someone senior to me or a department, I never even learned how marketing systems work. Just mindlessly doing actions based on the sales strategy of the management.\n\nJust come across the other post in this sub earlier today asking \"how would you rate your marketing skills\" and someone else answering about his skills across: \n\nMarketing Strategy-  Data analytics - Finance-Marketing interface - International Marketing Entertainment Marketing - Networking - Pricing -  Trade Marketing - Product Marketing-  Promotion. \n\nCouldn't place myself above bottom 10% in any of these. To be totally fair, I haven't even done anything related to most of those. \n\nHere's the catch: my start-up used to be in B2B marketing, with a 3 year sales cycle and a few sales per year (X.X M€ per sale), which are basically impossible to track with systems. It's all business development and sales. \n\nNow I'm moving on from that position (still into a sole-marketeer B2B position, but with a better potential of building a marketing department and with a fresh mindset) , I feel kind of ashamed of my strategic skillset after 5 years and would like to fast track the development. \n\nWhat would you recommend? Without peers to learn from, what's the best way to become a kick-ass marketeer?\n\n",

You’ve been running campaigns, managing content, implementing CRM, and touching brand, that’s experience most people don’t get until much later. If you want to fast-track strategic skills, I’d focus on two things: documenting what works and why, and studying frameworks for B2B marketing at scale. Case studies, post-mortems, and even reverse-engineering campaigns from companies in similar spaces can help you see the bigger picture. Pair that with tools and analytics practice, and you’ll start bridging the gap between tactical execution and strategic thinking Honestly, the fact that you’re reflecting on this now is already a step ahead of most people in similar roles.",

I developed my creative direction getting ads over the line for print, digital, OOH, in-store etc, overall brand management. Owning A&P budgets for suppliers ranging from 50-100k to upwards of 1.5M. Oh, can’t forget procurement and vendor management/relationships, strong sales and marketing decks specific/changed for certain audiences, client relations, and I am sure I’m missing a lot. \n\nIt was a very busy job, and at the time I didn’t realize how much I was learning, and how useful the smorgasbord of tasks would be for my future career. \n\nSince I left that job, I’ve had 2 other jobs in brand marketing/management, significantly raised my salary on the route, have full teams under me, and landed a fractional VP role in commercial, and all remote, all start-ups. I also pick up contracts for data, brand design, marketing strategies.

          "text": "You mentioned my case, but context matters a lot. \n\nI also sucked in the beginning. But I'm not a beginner anymore. \n\nI'm 52 years old. With a career of decades. In industry and academia. Living in 3 countries and knowing much more than that. A BS, MS, MBA, and PhD. Working with social media when people didn't call that social media yet. Being involved with AI years before it became popular. Being involved with arts and entertainment my whole life. \n\nAlso, differentiation is very important to me. It's nearly impossible to be similar to me, and that shouldn't be the goal. \n\nI remember a former boss who told me I'd never be successful in marketing. \n\nMy recommendation is to think about your own strategy. What is your targeting strategy, like the type of job and company you have as goals? What is your positioning strategy, like the type of reputation you want to develop?\n\nAnd then, network and try to find someone who is following a similar path and is ahead of you. I didn't get here alone. But I had to find the right people and engage with them, it's not something that just happened. \n\nWaiting for the company or others to help me would be a terrible idea. I had to take responsibility for my future.\n\nMy path is far from being a straight line.\n\nTo be good at the finance-marketing interface now, I worked a lot with finance and accounting, I worked for investors to analyze startups, and I did my master's in corporate finance.\n\nTo be good at entertainment marketing now, I worked as a comic book writer and I worked for a tv company. I traveled to Broadway lots of times. I develop my games as a hobby.\n\nTo be good at international marketing, I used the fact that I was \"invisible\" to most marketers because of my background. Then, instead of seeing people and countries that others usually know, I saw the invisible like me. \n\nEventually, those different paths merged to make me what I am today. But I wasn't even planning to be in marketing. I didn't apply to my first official job in marketing, it's the company that found me. \n\nSucking in the beginning is natural, expected. Startups are, by definition, starting. They shouldn't act as if they are mature companies, although many do.\n\nI told a mentee some time ago: don't be better, be different, be yourself. \n\nThere will always be someone better than me if we're talking about marketing skills. But there won't be someone better than me if we're talking about being myself. \n\nFor example, I always say that marketing literally starts with market, which is basically consumers. But, when I interview job applicants, I see many people who know about media and computers but don't know about customers and people. \n\nNow, even knowing the basics is enough to make a job applicant stand out to me.\n\nWith the finance-marketing interface, not many marketers can talk about the differences between sales, revenue, profit, cash generation, and value.\n\nWith marketing analytics, not many marketers can discuss correlation not being causation in marketing practice, garbage in garbage out, and statistical biases. Even if that's statistics 101.",

So don't be too hard on yourself. Here's how most big companies do \"marketing\" and because they must have a lot of money, you see smaller companies trying to replicate and suffering for because they don't have patient capital or patient investors:\n\n1. make your board happy  \n2. make your investors happy  \n3. look good for wall street  \n4. look good on social media  \n5. build brand authority  \n6. win recognition from peers  \n7. finally getting around to MAYBE selling something\n\nI was sitting in the c-suite making purchasing decisions on years long sales cycles like you mentioned. I never needed another pitch deck or slide show and I could care less what colors your logo had. I needed consistent communication and telling me how to solve a specific problem if you wanted me to speed the process through all the channels. \n\nTake a more direct marketing approach (even if you aren't a direct marketing biz) and see how it goes. But the key thing is, don't beat yourself up because you're not the odd one out in this situation.\n\n",

Blatantly \n\nAlso a lot of time they gave you BS by quoting some paper or the other without context. And the nail in the coffin- zero respect for CI . Like who gave a fuck \n\nComing to you. My question is over 5 years why did you not look for another job elsewhere? \n\nMarketing isn’t a trade yiu understand by learning in the job. Things like CI And brand and architecture and sub brands and strategy and originality etc , and ideas don’t just come from a place where ur ceo tells you what to do . So why?",

We have access to the exact people we need to reach, either via paid ads or organic posting.

But it lets us test the entire GTM with events/automation/campaigns with two ppl working together. Then we share the results across the teams. \n\nWe use LinkedIn a lot but we just put in the hard work of actually talking to people, trying to add value and be friendly. So far it’s works. But it’s slow and steady. \n\nWe also direct mailed Christmas baskets to 10 key leads in Dec. We’ve closed 3 of those and have another 3 in a trial very likely to close. So yeah, old school thoughtful gifts, who knew? That’s less marketing and sales though, despite it being Marketing’s idea. \n\nWe have no ad budget beyond 1 or 2 boosted LinkedIn post. We’re done a couple of influencer partnerships which I thought would work but didn’t really get us anywhere. \n\nHTH",

In 2026, the only thing that still works for me is building real relationships through a daily manual loop. I stopped chasing the general feed and started focusing on a small list of fifty people who actually fit my target profile.\n\nHere is the simple system I use now:\n\n\n\n1. Build a list of fifty prospects and only engage with their posts.\n\n2. Leave three thoughtful comments a day to get noticed.\n\n3. Send a connection note only after they see my name a few times.\n\n4. Track every DM so nobody slips through the cracks.\n\nI use Depost AI to manage this workflow. It helps me create a targeted feed of just those fifty people and drafts my first comments and DMs so I stay consistent. It also reminds me when to follow up. Happy to share my daily checklist if you want it.",

If the MQL is event stage 3 but sale is after event stage 30, you will have a hard time selling the CEO that you had impact in that sale. Get used to fighting for your value.\n\nWe talk about cost for acquisition, cost for MQL vs SQL, cost for this cost for that because CFOs run modern marketing and sales teams, not CEOs. And that's why so many companies fail.\n\nAdvertising days were simple. Spend $50,000 on a billboard and generate $150,000 in new revenue. You just made a $100,000 profit from the advertising department. That's easy for a CEO to ignore the CFO when he says \"well you don't know if they would have come in without the billboard. Maybe if we cut billboards they'll come in anyway\".\n\nAttribution has become so convoluted for most companies and everyone fights for who \"sold\" the lead that the CEO cant extrapolate on if marketing had any impact in generating that revenue from the CFO. So you get cut and nobody respects you thinking you provide tiktok dances.",

          "text": "There is not enough information in your post to provide specific advice, so I’ll explain how I see it.\n\nThere is no “sales vs marketing.” You have to sit under one function, one team. Whether you call it a go-to-market function or something else, sales and marketing are just different aspects of the same job, and everyone needs to be focused on the same goal; closed deals. Honestly, that’s the only way the fighting stops.\n\nYour goal shouldn’t be MQLs. Most likely sales are correct, a lot of your leads are shite. But also, I’ve found sales teams are incredibly bad at doing what they say they’re going to do in terms of follow-up. So there are two fixes.\n\nFirst: change the KPI you focus on.\nI barely report on MQLs. The only thing I look at is high-intent revenue opportunities — basically any lead that makes it past the first deal stage in the sales process. Once they’ve actually had a meeting with sales and sales has said, “yeah, this person could be a good fit,” that’s when I count it.\n\nAnd I don’t report that as # of leads. I report it as the dollar value of potential opportunities I’ve created for sales to close. \n\nThat’s also the easiest way to get management on side. You can apply an average contract value to those opportunities — even though you don’t know the exact deal size yet — and suddenly you have a real estimate of the pipeline marketing has generated for sales to close. At that point, it’s on sales to close it. You’ve already qualified that it’s relevant. Whether the deal falls apart or not, sales themselves have confirmed it’s a legitimate opportunity. Using the average close rate you can also estimate how much should have been closed won.\n\nThis is the only metric that really matters because it also improves your marketing effectiveness. It tells you whether the channels you’re using are producing garbage or producing quality. Right now, MQLs don’t give you any quality signal, so you either end up spending money in the wrong places or you just don’t know.\n\nSecond: alignment.\n\nYou need to be on more sales calls and more sales meetings. If they have a weekly deal review, be there. Learn what they know about the deals. Marketing’s job is not just to bring leads into the top of the funnel. It’s to help sales get deals across the line. Be methodical with follow-up. If you spend the time tracking this correctly then you can actually hold sales reps accountable for not doing their tasks. Bring it up to the Sales Manager or on weekly review meetings. It’s the team’s responsibility to keep everyone accountable.\n\nLook at sales enablement. What do they actually need? Where are deals breaking? What do they feel they’re missing? Can you create content to help — product explanations, specific demos, competitive info, whatever it is. When you do that, sales starts to feel like you’re working with them, not against them, and everyone starts pushing in the same direction.\n\nYou also need to shift your thinking from leads to accounts. Think of marketing in terms of TAM > ICP > Accounts > Contacts > Deals.\n\nHow many accounts are in your ICP?\nHow are you reaching those accounts?\nHow many contacts exist inside each account?\nHow are you reaching each of those people?\nHow many are currently engaged with by marketing?\n\nTrack engaged accounts, not just random leads popping their head up. Track contact-level engagement with campaigns. Track how many contacts are engaged per account. Then you can go to Sales and say here are x number of accounts in our ICP that we’ve engaged with in the last x days. Narrow the team’s focus on those accounts. It shows Sales leadership that marketing is working the right accounts pre any deal being created.\n\nReal attribution comes from working directly with sales. Ask “where did you hear about us?” on lead forms for sure, but what I personally do is go through every deal created and ask the sales rep where it actually came from. If they don’t know, I have them ask that question in the first meeting.",

              "text": "There is already a lot of good advice above, so I’ll just add a two key points.\n\nFirst, it sounds like there’s a significant misalignment between marketing and sales. You need a clear, shared definition of what counts as a marketing-qualified lead versus a sales-qualified lead. Once both sides agree and buy into that definition, it becomes much harder to argue over lead quality and it reduces ambiguity substantially.\n\nSecond, I’m consistently surprised by how many marketers have little real understanding of sales. A strong marketer spends time with the sales team, observes the full sales cycle, listens to customer objections, and understands the emotional impact the product or service has on the customer. You will not learn that by staying in the office. You have to be in the field with sales.\n\nThis is actually something I have used as a screening criterion when hiring for marketing roles. I ask how they interact with customers and how closely they work with the sales team. I want the marketer who stands with the sales team at the point of display if it’s a product, or sits in on pitches and listens to real conversations if its services. \n\nThat is how you learn how to market effectively to those customers. If a marketer is not doing that, then they are essentially marketing in the blind.",

The fix I have seen work is building a lead scoring matrix together where both sides define what makes a prospect worth pursuing, score inbound leads consistently, and review mismatches monthly. The monthly review is the key part - when sales says this lead was garbage you have data to discuss rather than finger-pointing. Takes about 3-4 months to calibrate but once it is running the blame game mostly stops because everyone agreed to the criteria upfront.",

Be willing to watch sales calls, or even talk to prospects/customers yourself. Do whatever it takes.\n\nIf you're in a B2B company, sales is king, it doesn't matter if they're shit at closing, or if it's Marketing's fault the leads don't work - at the end of the day if the company is not making money nobody has a good time.

The only time I’ve seen this calm down is when both sides agree in plain English what a real SQL actually is (not just a HubSpot score), then look at actual closed-won vs dead deals together and spot patterns. We also stopped reporting just “leads delivered” and started tracking the full chain, MQL to SQL, SQL to opportunity, opportunity to closed won, so you can see exactly where things fall apart instead of arguing in the abstract. The other big unlock was forcing sales to tag why leads were rejected or lost so marketing could adjust targeting instead of guessing. Most of the time the fight isn’t that leads are garbage, it’s that nobody agreed on what good looks like or where the drop-off is actually happening.",

Once you have that, introduce a lead SLA where marketing commits to volume and quality, and sales commits to logging what happened to every single lead within 48 hours because an unworked lead isn't a garbage lead, and that distinction kills the argument. Add a mandatory rejection reason field in Salesforce so you actually know why leads die rather than just that they do, ditch the separate dashboards in favour of one shared weekly view both teams look at together, and put someone in charge of the MQL-to-SQL gap specifically, because right now nobody owns that stretch of the funnel and that's exactly why everyone argues across it instead of fixing it.

It just makes you faster and more efficient (especially for repetitive tasks). \n\nI'd argue that \"quality\" elements are also present - I always mistype the same words and make the same random typos, but the AI doesn't make those mistakes, so I'm actually less \"stressed\" when reviewing the copy since I know those basic mistakes won't be there. More of my attention is directed towards the storytelling bit. \n\nI'm not sure how you can produce \"better\" marketing with AI, given that the output is essentially the median of what it learned; there's no \"creativity\" per se, and I rarely see outputs that make me pause to appreciate them (they can be OK and, occasionally, good). Sure, there are exceptions, and everyone has their own definition of \"good\". \n\nAlso, if you're in B2B, there are certain ways to write certain things at all times. It's just the way it is. Many things, like success stories in specialized (and litigious) industries, have to be written a certain way (at least that's the ask from the stakeholders). AI is perfect for that type of formulaic storytelling. \n\nBut, there's the other side - AI is good at producing a lot of pure crap, and that can ALSO be good. For example, I'm writing ads - format is set, word count is set. Not that much room for creativity when each symbol counts. I have a few ideas, but I'm stuck. I ask AI to produce something, and it immediately spits out a TON of crappy options. That gives me the idea of where NOT to go with the copy. That's where creativity begins for me in these specific cases. ",

We can talk about Maslow's Theory of Needs. Which is usually an oversimplification without context of the paper wrote.\n\nBut tapping on that doesn't happen because of any book I read. I'm basically a living example of Maslow's Needs. I was born in poverty, my father used to be homeless, I know what being hungry is, I was running away from bullets when I was a teenager. I doubt someone can learn about Needs related to physiological  or safety needs by reading a book. \n\nThere is a lot of things I've learned by traveling, meeting people, talking to them, looking them into their eyes. \n\nEven for something like System 1 and 2, I read many books, I knew a lot able theory, but I didn't really know how to tap into my own mind before learning from an experienced psychologist. We should be very careful when triggering people.\n\nHumans are not like machines with a clear way to turn them on or off. More than books, I recommend dealing with people. \n\nTo give another simple example. I did an activity with people being asked to look at each other while I played a song. At the end, I asked: do you need any data to tell me how that music triggered different people in different ways? The answer was a clear no. The look in the eyes, the smiles, the gestures, or the lack of those reactions taught them a lot. \n\nBooks often help me to understand the \"why.\" But if I want to understand \"how,\" then I prefer experience. I love being in the crowd seeing people's reactions.",

And I'm not a digital marketer.\n\nBut, for something “that shouldn’t have worked… but did” like the title says, I remember someone intentionally creating and spreading fake news. The goal was basically to show that what shouldn't work, actually worked very well. Major news channels should know better than just spreading the nonsense that they created. \n\nThey documented the process, and later they revealed what they did. They exposed the news channels, and showed knowldge and skills to deal with information online. ",

But that doesn't mean I recommend that to everyone. It's a big pivot, not easy to do.\n\nI'm also an international marketer. That means I'm more involved with different parts of the world. At the very least, capitalism can work in different ways in different places. The US is often ranked first in the rank of individualism, but other countries are much more collectivist or balanced, for example. Then, I often find marketing more meaningful in other countries. \n\nAnd, more than anything, I remember that marketing literally starts with market. And that basically means customers, people. Real, not digital. Social in a way that I don't think social media is anymore, as social media is often antisocial now. I want to deal with people and society, not with computers and technology although I do use computers and technology. I like to talk to people face to face, be there in the middle of the crowd, understand feelings and needs.",

That really clarified things for me and I knew I couldn't spend another 20-30 years doing this. I spent some time considering what I wanted to do with my life, what my non-negotiables were, etc. It has not been an easy or quick decision for me. I feel like I've considered every passing whim I've had in my life to decide haha. For me, I'll be going back to school in the fall to pursue social work. I'd suggest for you to go through a similar process and see if there's something still under the marketing umbrella you can pivot to, or if there's something outside of marketing entirely that you can do. As much as I'm disillusioned by it, there's still a lot I've learned from my marketing career that I feel can set me up for my next step, and the same is true for anyone.",

The marketing director was great, so were the Marketing Assistant and the CTO. \n\nThe interviews felt more like a chat than an interview, I was put at ease both time, I honestly left feeling really positive.\n\nHowever, when I went home while I was double checking whether it was a hybrid working model or not (my deal breaker) I stumbled across their glassdoor reviews… and most of them were pretty bad. \n\nOverall score of 3.2, about 50% of those have in their cons toxic senior management, long working hours weekend included at no pay, and high turnover, blame culture. These all from people either in sales, asset management, or similar. Nothing from Marketing, as the department itself is new. \n\nI never worked in a big company, so I’m wondering if I should be worried about these reviews, or don’t give them too much weight as they’re all from other departments? In my current office the culture is amazing, everyone is incredibly flexible and there is no blame culture. I really want to try and avoid a toxic workplace if I can, but the interviews are now done and I can’t ask any more questions. \n\nThe marketing director final words to me were that she promised I would leave that job, whenever that may be, better than when I started, both as a person and as a marketer. \n\nWhat would you do? What’s your experience with this, and do you have any advice? ",

See if that's the case and weigh that however you want to. If they are consistently poor over the course of the last year, it's a bigger red flag than a concentrated set of bad reviews over the span of a month or two. \n\nI took a contract job last year and had great interviews, pay was good, job seemed relatively easy, was a no brainer. Should have checked Glassdoor, they had a sub 2 star rating and as soon as I started, it showed. Could have saved myself a lot of stress. \n\nThen again -- companies show very little loyalty to employees, and if you really need a job, just take it, do the work, take their money, and know you'll be moving on as soon as you feel is necessary.",

If they’re really great that can be the result of campaigning by the employer and if they’re terrible that can be disgruntled or underperforming employees lashing out. There’s good and bad in just about any workplace and that’s hugely dependent on your specific team and also your attitude.\n\nIf your current job is so great, why are you leaving? That isn’t a rhetorical question. Something is prompting you to leave a known situation where you’re seemingly happy. Glassdoor reviews or no, any new job carries a ton of risk that you won’t be as happy. Do the benefits of that jump outweigh the risks?",

Even if you have high quality content, it might ignore you for a variety of inane reasons. Sometimes it's just delayed. Some LLM's do the search for you, but again, the results are highly personalized. \n\n5k organic visits per month is pretty low, honestly. What's your existing conversion rate? Are you focusing on paid opportunities through social media? \n\nIf you're a big enough brand, have you reached out to AI companies to do a proper partnership?

LLMs love pulling from FAQ-style content because it maps directly to how people ask questions\n\n- third party mentions matter way more than backlinks for AI. reddit threads, quora answers, industry reports that mention your brand by name -- those get picked up. backlinks from authority sites help Google but LLMs weight \"being talked about\" differently\n\n- schema markup helps but its not magic. what really moved the needle for the brands scoring 80+ in our data was having consistent entity information across multiple sources -- same descriptions, same feature lists, same positioning language everywhere\n\n- one weird finding: competitors who rank lower on Google but have more detailed comparison pages (\"us vs them\" style) actually get recommended MORE by ChatGPT and Perplexity. the models seem to love structured comparison content\n\nthe frustrating part is theres no rank tracker equivalent for this yet (working on one actually). so most people are flying blind, testing random queries manually. if you want a quick sanity check, try asking ChatGPT \"what are the best [your category] tools\" and see if you show up -- then try 10 variations of that query. the inconsistency will probably shock you",

Referrals are undefeated if you’re delivering real results.\n\nWhere I see people get stuck though is assuming referrals will just “happen.” The teams that make them consistent usually systemize two things:\n\n1. They create visible wins. Case studies, quick recap emails after big projects, sharing results internally so their champion looks smart. That’s what triggers “you should talk to them.”\n2. They ask at the right moment. Not randomly, but right after a measurable win or positive feedback. A simple “Is there anyone else in your network dealing with X?” goes a long way.\n\nFor us it’s been 60–70% referrals, 30–40% active marketing. The active side isn’t to replace referrals, it’s to smooth out the gaps between them.\n\nGood work compounds, but distribution still matters. The sweet spot is doing great work and making sure the right people actually see it.",

What specific targeting rules have actually improved your net revenue (not just signups)? Also I need some side opinions on some matters:\n\nPaid traffic: Do you hide popups for traffic coming from ads? I feel like I'm paying twice (click + discount) if I don't.\n\nReturning visitors: When do you stop showing the discount? After 2 visits? Or do you switch to a different offer like VIP access?\n\nHesitation signals: Besides standard exit-intent, are there better triggers to catch people who are stuck on the price?\n\nI need real targeting ideas, not change the button color advice.

What’s worked for us is hiding discounts from high-intent traffic (fast PDP → add to cart users and branded search visitors don’t get an offer), and triggering based on behavior instead of timers. Things like deep scroll + 60s on PDP, reopening the same product twice, or checking the size guide without adding to cart are way stronger hesitation signals than basic exit intent. We also gate by cart value lower carts might get a bundle push, higher carts get free shipping instead of % off to protect margin. And for returning visitors, we stop repeating discounts after first use and switch to urgency or social proof.

If someone views 2+ PDPs and adds to cart within a short window, no offer. Same for branded search traffic. Those users don’t need a coupon — they need frictionless checkout.\n\nSecond, we trigger based on hesitation behavior, not time. 60–90 seconds on PDP, multiple image zooms, size guide clicks without add-to-cart, or repeat visits to the same SKU within 7 days. That’s where a nudge works.\n\nThird, we segment by cart value. Lower cart gets bundle/threshold messaging (“$12 away from free shipping”), higher cart gets free shipping instead of % off. Protects AOV and margin.\n\nFor returning visitors, we stop showing discounts after first redemption and switch to social proof or urgency. Otherwise you train repeat buyers to wait.\n\nBig shift for us was this: optimize for incremental revenue, not popup CVR. High-intent users need reassurance. Fence-sitters need incentive.

I want to see good reasons and some evidence that the investment is worth it. That's true in general, like advertising, research, machinery, new employees, stocks, etc.\n\nIf the company can't get good results organically, for example, paying may just multiply the mistakes the company is doing organically.\n\nDifferent forms of promotion have different advantages and disadvantages. Companies often don't trust word of mouth because they can't control it. But customers often trust word of mouth better because companies can't control it.\n\nInstead of thinking of each alternative separately, it's better to me to think about the promotion mix in this case. In a way that matches my strategy and context, including your budget. Even if something is good, if that makes the company bite more than it can chew, it's not really a recommendation. I'd probably go back to improving strategy like targeting better.",
