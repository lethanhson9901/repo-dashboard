Every change needs buy-in, every experiment needs alignment, every idea needs to survive a meeting where nobody wants to be responsible if it fails. So nothing ships unless it already feels safe, which usually means it’s late or obvious. Then leadership asks why marketing isn’t “proactive,” while the system is designed to punish anyone who tries to be.",

Small mistakes happened over time which lead them to adding more and more people to the approval workflow without ever sitting back and thinking “is this really necessary?” \n\nIn my humble opinion, they SHOULD reflect on the amount of time they’re wasting on approvals. Or, if you’re not already, use a collaborative tool that makes reviewing the documents a smoother process. A specific one that comes to mind is Figma. People can leave comments in specific spots, reply to each other, tag people, etc. That functionality exists in other programs too such as the Google suite and Acrobat. \n\nThe other problem I see with this level of absurdity is not having a clear scope of the work. Now this is really quite general because things can change. People have one off conversations that they later come to believe as fact. Really the most important thing is to have a paper trail of your conversations and feedback. If it becomes such a problem that you cannot meet a deadline then it needs to be addressed. But if they’ve baked this amount of approval rounds into the timeline, well, then at least they had some sense.",

He's one of those high verbal IQ genius types, we were both former anthro majors with an interest in linguistics. He had literally been #1 of everyone a few times.\n\nOne of the languages he was doing was French. I actually happen to speak French. (I was fluent like 15 years ago, lol. Oral comprehension is rusty rn, but I can read fluently still. Ime, they say \"use it or you lose it,\" but it actually seems to come back if you start using it again.) \n\nI was noticing he'd been doing French on Duolingo for like, probably 2 years, at least 1 year, yet hadn't really progressed in what it was teaching him. I was like \"Wait, why aren't they moving you to like, other verb tenses or something?\"\n\nI don't use the app myself (tho I've played w it a bit in the past), so this is secondhand, but it kind of struck me as some kind of infinite French 101 loop that never really seemed to change or advance much.",

I have NOT done so, but I guess they still recorded the email opening event as a \"yes\" and started blasting. \n\n\nBecause I always use strong passwords with 2FA and since when does Duolingo run security scans for other platforms lol.

Think of it like a pyramid where only the most senior aka oldest folks get to stick around. That means the rest of that pyramid is filled with younger people. \n\nAdditionally a job like being the head of social media for a big company is now an outdated concept since it's ubiquitous so he didn't really chase a career path of getting into other disciplines or becoming a CMO. \n\nIn short, he's too old for young jobs and his background doesn't really align with the type of work he was getting before. Startups who are looking to challenge the companies he's worked for are looking for someone willing to grind 80 hours a week or more, not go with a seasoned executive who would probably save them a lot of time and money but not appease a startup founders demands for a fast pace and long hours.\n\nTo be honest when I walked into the advertising department at an in-house marketing job that I had 20 plus years ago I knew the writing was on the wall; there was one gray/white haired man running it, a few women in their 40s as VPs and everyone else was under 30.\n\nIt was at that time that I either needed to become part of the 1% as an executive internally or startup and not have to worry about getting fired due to ageism.

          "text": "Job demand and opportunity has been good for me. I have a lot of generalist experience (growth management, demand generation) but focused into paid media in the last 7 years specifically.\n\nWhat I find is that companies want to hire marketers who are good at managing money in vs. money out. While all marketers may be good at this, paid search and paid display are quite literally functions of this. When set up correctly, you can generally scale any good business model up with clear, repeatable ROAS to show for it. I have held senior leadership roles during this time where my only true responsibility is managing an ad account, but one that is effectively doubling revenue for the company as a whole.\n\nHaving a generalist background is great because it allows you to collaborate more effectively across departments, work more closely with agency partners to scale out capacity, and identify areas to grow internal head count. But it’s not really a good role to be in later into you career unless you plan on freelancing. Being a jack of all trades is good, but not always desirable over specialists.\n\nThat being said, fast growth startups may want to hire generalists as their first marketing hire to test the waters. I’ve seen that a lot.\n\nMy advice to marketers is generally: take whatever first role you are offered, excel at it, and then wear as many hats as you can. Learn from others, build a broad understanding of tactics and roles, and evntually pivot to a generalist position at the midway point of your career. Use this time to identify where the money is at — not just returns, but where are businesses investing most of their capital. That’s likely paid media, but can be other areas too. That’s where you should pivot to.\n\nMarketers aren’t going away because of AI, but we are expected to do more with less. That’s not necessarily new: big data and machine learning have been a part of the job for as long as I can remember. So companies want to hire people who can effectively manage money in vs. money out to scale demand. Teams are smaller, responsibilities outsourced, but the work is definitely there for people willing to adapt. The key is to demonstrate the value of work constantly. (It is worth pointing out that AI is generally driving up costs on traditional channels, and likely will, but this is not a new trend)\n\nMy biggest concern at the moment is that marketing is demand during times of growth. Traditionally, I have been hired onto companies that need to grow sales fast and are looking to maximize output from new investments. But that period never lasts, and it can be hard to show value when leadership wants to cut costs and scale down. Marketing is an easy expenditure because it’s often viewed as a flat cost. I’ve had success testing cost effective strategies when I notice demand tapers, or operations/production begins to falter from growth in demand, so that I have an easy pivot in strategy when I’m eventually told to stop growing business and instead grow bottom line profits.\n\nA major recession would be an industry-wide challenge. That’s my longterm concern, which is why I’m currently working in a leadership role for a company that is largely recession proof. I could make more in tech or SaaS doing the same work, but I’m happy having a stable job that isn’t *as exposed* to another market downturn.",

I’ve peeked in on them on LinkedIn every now and then and it looks like the company has contracted by about one-third since then due to people leaving and not being replaced.\n\nIt’s been an immensely frustrating job market. I was laid off in 2013 from a fairly visible role in the community, and quickly got a lot of offers for freelance or contracting work before going back to full-time five months later. I also managed to find a new role (at the agency) within three weeks of a layoff in 2022.\n\nBy contrast, this market just seems so much more competitive, with plenty of roles getting hundreds of applications. I know of two more people in my network who have also been struggling to find a role despite extensive experience and impressive resumes.\n\nMy wife works in health care and makes decent money, so thankfully we’re doing OK financially. I’ve been able to focus a bit more on child care while bringing in some money from freelancing and contract work, but am still plugging away at full-time roles that fit well. Currently in consideration for one that’s a great fit, so I’m really hopeful that will work out.",

Indeed, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, they’re all oversaturated and bloated with WAY too many irrelevant and unrelated job postings where the hiring manager has tagged “marketing” when the role is for customer support, or finance, or whatever other department that isn’t marketing. \n\nThey’re trying to cast as wide a net as possible in hopes that they can catch the eyes of top candidates but in reality we’re all just ships passing each-other in the dead of night. I finally found my current position by applying directly to companies through their careers pages after researching relevant employers in the industries I wanted to work in.",

It was definitely quite hectic during product launches.\n\nMaybe what you want is a **classic corporate job where the focus is on relationships/politics** rather than driving fast results through computers instead of people. Probably some **middle-management position lower than VP**.\n\nOr as an entrepreneur/consultant you can set your own schedule and how you work.",

I’m equally concerned that failing to honor the original prize could be seen as a 'scam' and cause irreversible damage to our brand's reputation in the community. Currently, my leadership remains hesitant to fulfill the $1,000 prize pool due to the low turnout and is pushing to swap the rewards for brand merchandise instead. Given this, I’d love to know: if the company insists on this 'prize downgrade,' what is the best way to handle 'damage control' with these 3 participants? Furthermore, for a growing niche brand, what are some modern, value-driven engagement tactics you'd recommend for 2026 that move beyond outdated hashtag giveaways?",

The danger is that those 3 participants are also perfectly capable of creating content to harm your brand if you execute the bait-and-switch your boss demands.\n\nMaybe you can find a compromise by deleting the contest, contact privately the 3 participants, tell them they won but kindly ask them to remove their posts because you were informed of some unfortunate legal issue and had to pull the contest. And then offer them the lowest prizes from your prize pool. That's not quite ethical but your boss gets something and your brand promoters feel valued.",

If the company decides to do things that risk their reputation and survival, it's their choice. But I start to think more about my reputation. Networking is very important to me. And I develop a reputation of working for shady companies, I can really damage my reputation. \n\nBrand crises are part of what I've done. But crises that are unintentional, not something almost planned like this. Damage control doesn't make much sense to me when my company is the one doing something that can cause the damage, and aware of what it's doing. \n\nYour situation feels like doing something wrong and trying to get away with it.

However, end of 2025 in dec, I finally got one.\n\nA digital marketer for a retail store selling combat sports equipment. The business moved on from marketing agencies to an in-house role. Boxing gloves, hand wraps, muay thai shorts, shinguards etc. Last year the store made \\~$9-10 million in sales. The goal is $30 million in sales by 2030. \n\nThis being my first proper 9-5 marketing gig, I just realised im taking on the work of an entire agency all by myself (im the only hired marketer). I do everything from shopify, klaviyo, google workspace, meta ads, reporting, optimisation, strategies, and its getting overwhelming.\n\nSo I wanted to get some insight of other people who may be in a similar role to me within a similar niche/industry. Do you do the same things? How do you manage your time? What kind of strategies or content do you do for your role, and what would you suggest for mine?\n\nThanks in advance",

Even at seven almost eight figures annually in spend across all marketing efforts we've gotten it to the point where the half million in salaries can go towards more paid media, tech stack or content.\n\nOverall, I'd never have all of those tasks under one role, its doable technically but you'll be half assing lots of things, I'd ask you to game out a few scenarios outside of doing it all yourself. Whoever hired you may think it's doable but it's going to be rough to do it all yourself",

It seems most companies or agencies have a huge blind spot when it comes to picking influencers. They keep picking creators based on a premium look or a wealthy lifestyle that has literally zero overlap with the brand’s real demographic. It’s frustrating to see mass market brands being promoted by influencers whose content screams fitness and healthy lifestyle.  \n  \nLike come on, why is your cheap greasy cookie filled with chocolate being promoted by a 20 year old from beverly hills who would literally never eat it? Or why do you choose a influencer who has a healthy lifestyle like a religion to promote your liquor brands? \n\nThe thing is, i'd actually be ok with these choices if it came with spectacular results but oh boy, at best you see some mild improvements in metrics. Like, it's almost never worth it. Again, not all campaigns are like that and not all brands but this seems to happens enough for me to talk about it.",

You hadn’t convinced how a new slogan can work for them, just that the old one is tired in your eyes. That’s not enough of a reason with millions and hundreds of millions at stake. Have you done focus group testing to back your claim why new slogan is better than old? Receives more engagement? My guess is no. So it’s just your word against the school. The school will always win out. If you aren’t prepared to show data, then get out of the way. These are educators. If anyone can appreciate data it’s them. Do the work. Get some focus groups going. Orrrrrrr….. take your ideas to the social media side for A/B testing. It’s lower risk for failure and may strengthen your argument for change on future campaigns by showing engagement/follow-through. You will at least have some preliminary data sets to review and pitch. Some slogans are evergreen. They always work. Black Friday Sales as an example. You don’t have to be unique…. People already anticipate and expect it. Put your creative talents elsewhere and save your fight for another topic. This may not be the answer you want to hear, but one you should heed. Your career will be filled with battles to plant your flag in and make a stand. Make sure it’s one you want to do this with, or if you should regroup and lose the battle to win the larger war.",

For a long time, we blamed low engagement on content, emails, or timing.\n\nAfter a few events, it became clear the real problem wasn’t messaging at all. It was friction. Slow check-in, confusing apps, inconsistent data, and too many tools stitched together. Attendees started the day annoyed, and no campaign could really recover from that.\n\nOnce we focused on reducing friction at the operational level, engagement numbers improved without changing our marketing strategy much.\n\nCurious if others have seen this.  \nHave you ever discovered that an engagement or ROI issue was caused by tooling or operations rather than marketing itself?",

Our events are highly regarded as very high quality and so it's not an on-site issue for us, but much of the time the topics that sponsors want to push, their choosing to sponsor events around because those topic areas are heavily saturated already and they need to differentiate. So sponsor friendly topics are oftentimes not audience friendly topics. It's an interesting dynamic.",
