It was my destiny to be in this.\n\nYet I feel my time has come for me to transition to something new, something more meaningful to me personally and to the contribution I can do to this world.\n\nStill brainstorming what that is, but I would like to ask all of you who was previously a marketer and to what industry/job have you transitioned to?\n\nWas it scary & risky?\n\nAre you happier?\n\nLet me hear your experiences or of people you know with this story.\n\nBest,",

I actually wasn't planning to move to marketing, it was the company that found me.\n\nI don't think I'll ever leave marketing again, but the reason is that marketing is so big. It always made more sense to move to different parts of marketing. \n\nI've been avoiding things like digital marketing, social media marketing or anything related to promotion for a long time, although I do have some experience with that. \n\nWhen I wanted to do something more strategic, I started doing more marketing strategy.\n\nWhen I wanted to do something more related to data, I started going more marketing analytics.\n\nLater, I wanted to do something that is closer (and more meaning) to who I am as a person, not only professionally.\n\nI got closer to entertainment marketing, like often going to Broadway when I was in New York.\n\nI expanded my international profile, getting closer to international marketing, moving to different countries and states.\n\nAnd I've been involved with other things I didn't expect, like sports marketing. I see people doing so many things in marketing. A different industry can also change the work a lot. \n\nAfter a long career, I started to think it's better to use my knowledge and experience to help the new generation. And I moved to academia. I'm still very connected to people in the industry, I'll never be a theoretical professor, but now I can help others start their careers (focused on marketing but not limited to that). \n\nSo, there are so many possibilities in marketing that I've been moving from one part of marketing to another part, but never quitting marketing. Sometimes I do get people inviting me to do something else, but I saw no reason to do that. I'd have to get an extremely good offer now to make me quit marketing, not only financially but matching my value and goals in life. \n\nWhen I choose to do something on social media or with digital marketing, it's because I have my own reasons to do it. Not because others told me to do that. They are like hobbies and side projects.",

Mostly around a central question around: is my career better off staying as a generalist or getting that product marketing experience?\n\nAnd to frame it, I don't really have an end goal per se (like, I'm not set on one day becoming a CMO... I enjoy the work I do and don't necessarily want to move away from being an IC)... but I do want to move up eventually in terms of making more money.\n\n**Current role:**\n\n* Marketing Director at a \\~50-person B2B startup (marketing team of one)\n* Own everything without a marketing boss really (I report to the CEO)\n* I'm working with and experimenting with AI a TON\n* Downside: very little structure, limited mentorship, and leadership can be scattered (And I don't really agree with the direction they are taking the company and it doesn't feel very mission driven) - so really I feel like I'm losing an edge on strategic thinking. I also don't see myself moving in to anything more than director here; they are resistant to even have me hire someone under me. \n\n**New opportunity:**\n\n* Product Marketing Director at a \\~5K-person, well-established company in the same industry (like a *this will look good on my resume* company)\n* Clearly defined role within a real PMM function\n* Strong, experienced manager and department\n* More structure, clearer expectations, and the chance to specialize and sharpen PMM skills - haven't held a PMM role before and I like the idea of having that in my toolkit for future roles; I feel like they pay more and are more impactful to the organization\n* Downside: wayyy less autonomy, probably less exposure to what's latest in AI, more crossfunctional work, more meetings\n\n**Other context:**\n\n* Same salary\n* Both remote\n* Similar expected work/life balance\n\n\n\nI’ve never formally been in product marketing, and part of me thinks learning how a strong PMM org operates could be really valuable long-term. But I also worry about giving up a “Head of Marketing” path too early (I've been here for \\~1.5 years)\n\n  \nSo, this was great to write out. I have some more thoughts now that I have. But any thoughts from this group are appreciated.",

Just say that you love the team and role, and you are looking for a boost from your current compensation. And that's worth 3 years of raises anyways, and compounds if you have percentage-based bonuses. And also consider bonuses/equity/insurance costs in your calculation as well.

I currently report into an exec who has navigated that for two decades while being the get shit done person, so it is working out well. That’s not always going to be the case. Personally I love being able to connect all the broken systems though because it does give a voice to your users that they may otherwise feel doesn’t exist. \n\nThat and I had a kid, which there was no way in hell I could deal with unicorn pace which was topping out at 80 hour weeks.",

          "text": "Tbh, Product Marketing is a weird space (subjectively). It's more pivotal than many other marketing roles. But at the same time, I've seen PMMs get fired before folks who run infrastructure/support basic marketing functions. Because re-hiring a PMM in the future is possible, but stopping large marketing campaigns because the \"email person\" is gone is not an option. \n\nAt the same time, the PMM toolkit is very valuable, as there's not a lot of really good, free learning on the topic. Last time I checked, about a year ago, or so, it seemed like most available courses were either too basic or too expensive. \n\nThe downside for PMMs that I've seen in larger companies is that much of their work \"dies in committees\" ... there are too many people involved in things like messaging sign-offs. A lot of it depends on the caliber of the teams PMMs interact with. Like, whether Product Managers are actually involved appropriately in collaboration and whatnot. \n\nSkillset-wise, PMM is probably the way to go for long-term career growth. \n\nBut it also depends on other factors. I used to go to a lot of interviews. Mostly as a way to gauge candidates' expectations and benchmark salary expectations. In many cases, I started to actually consider the move just because of the \"vibes\". Like, the people seemed nice, intelligent, had their shit together, etc. Some of that is intuitive. \n\nSort of unrelated, but the only career moves that worked for me were those that I made to companies with former colleagues (they'd refer me, or I'd reach out to learn about their current work and get interested). It's a solid way of learning how things really work inside the team, the dynamics, the workload, etc. \n",

Over time I moved more into an operational role across growth, performance, marketing, product, sales touchpoints, and fixing bottlenecks end-to-end. Less “marketing as a function,” more “where is revenue leaking and why.”\n\nA few thoughts based on that shift:\n\n* **Titles matter less than the surface area you own.** Being Head of Marketing / Marketing Director at a small startup *can* be a fast track, but only if you’re actually shaping the system. If you’re a team of one, firefighting channels, and leadership is resistant to leverage (hiring, tooling, process), you’ll plateau fast even if the title looks good.\n* **PMM at scale is a real skill, not a sidestep.** A strong PMM org teaches you things most early-stage roles never will: narrative discipline, launch rigor, stakeholder alignment, positioning under constraints. Those skills compound and translate well into CMO or GM roles later.\n* **The “Head of Marketing path” isn’t linear anyway.** The best growth leaders I know didn’t climb clean ladders. They zig-zagged through PMM, growth ops, revenue, lifecycle, even product. What mattered was learning how systems actually work, not protecting a title.\n* **Autonomy vs. learning is the real trade-off here.** Early-stage = autonomy, speed, chaos, shallow feedback loops. Larger org = structure, mentorship, deeper craft, slower execution. Neither is better by default. The question is: *where are you currently underdeveloped?*\n\nFrom what you wrote, it sounds like:\n\n* You already know how to operate independently\n* You’re starting to feel the ceiling of “team of one”\n* You value trajectory more than ego titles\n\nIf that’s true, a **PMM Director role at a strong company is not a step back**. It’s a sharpening move. You can always come back to a Head/VP role later with far more leverage and credibility.\n\nOne last thing: staying too long in an underpowered startup role can quietly stall you. I’ve seen that more often than people admit.",

You’re busy, but you’re not compounding. The question I’d ask myself isn’t “which title is better,” but “which role gives me better reps over the next 2–3 years?” If the PMM role gives you exposure to strong product thinking, real positioning decisions, and a functioning org to learn from, that’s usually a net win even if it looks like a lateral move on paper.",

I can promise you that Brenda from HR uses Instagram and Facebook. And that Stacy from Brand Marketing uses TikTok. \n\nBillboards for small brands are, imo, about brand awareness. If people don’t know about the brand, it’s the smallest nudge for them to think “huh wonder what [brand] is?” And then they forget about it the moment they pass by. But eventually an ad will come up on Instagram or TikTok and they’ll think “oh I remember seeing this brand somewhere, let’s check it out” instead of ignoring it and scrolling by. If people do know about the brand, it’s a small reminder that you exist. Billboards are used to keep big brands top of mind all the time. No matter where you look, you can’t ever forget [Big Brand Here], so when you go shopping, your brain’s first thought isn’t “I need pants” it’s “I need [Big Brand]. Can’t get them out of my head.”\n\nSo you can see why your billboard is clearly not working and also not going to work. Buy ads online.",

It works when you have an acquisition tactic executed in either that same area or where the commuters passing the billboard are coming from. If digital is not the way to go, then try direct mail, or do a test between direct mail and digital.    \n    \n2. The billboard creative is too busy. When I used to manage offer and creative for billboards as part of our media buy, I asked for an approach shot for each billboard. This is a shot taken from where a driver would likely see the billboard. It enabled me to determine the right creative for where that billboard is located.    \n    \n3. For creative, you might need to stick with an outcome based tagline, picture of your most popular type of install as the background image, your logo, and company name in legible format or URL if you can't make out the logo easily.",

I’m still admin, but my meta accounts are anonymized. I deleted twitter after knucklehead took it over and was a *very* late adopter to TT so that one was easy to delete a few months ago before the new T&Cs dropped. Our YouTube/google account is a company account with a company email, so not attached to me whatsoever. I still have a LinkedIn account, and my profile is still filled out, but I don’t post. It’s there to lurk every now and then. \n\nRealistically, you don’t have to have personal social media at all to be “relevant” in the grand scheme of marketing. I really only frequent Reddit, Pinterest, and occasionally I’ll spin up a reel or two on Instagram, but compared to the heyday of social media in my youth - I’m absolutely bare bones now. \n\nIt’s nice. Rather freeing actually. \n\nMaybe deactivate rather than delete and see how it goes? You can download all of your Facebook posts and data and it’s actually nice because it turns it into a giant scrollable file similar to the way it looks online.\n\nBottom line: you don’t have to be attached to socials personally to be good at them professionally, and if you want to offload them completely, hire someone else to take care of them and enjoy “overseeing” socials rather than participating. \n\nEdit: spelling",

The marketing director was great, so were the Marketing Assistant and the CTO. \n\nThe interviews felt more like a chat than an interview, I was put at ease both time, I honestly left feeling really positive.\n\nHowever, when I went home while I was double checking whether it was a hybrid working model or not (my deal breaker) I stumbled across their glassdoor reviews… and most of them were pretty bad. \n\nOverall score of 3.2, about 50% of those have in their cons toxic senior management, long working hours weekend included at no pay, and high turnover, blame culture. These all from people either in sales, asset management, or similar. Nothing from Marketing, as the department itself is new. \n\nI never worked in a big company, so I’m wondering if I should be worried about these reviews, or don’t give them too much weight as they’re all from other departments? In my current office the culture is amazing, everyone is incredibly flexible and there is no blame culture. I really want to try and avoid a toxic workplace if I can, but the interviews are now done and I can’t ask any more questions. \n\nThe marketing director final words to me were that she promised I would leave that job, whenever that may be, better than when I started, both as a person and as a marketer. \n\nWhat would you do? What’s your experience with this, and do you have any advice? ",

See if that's the case and weigh that however you want to. If they are consistently poor over the course of the last year, it's a bigger red flag than a concentrated set of bad reviews over the span of a month or two. \n\nI took a contract job last year and had great interviews, pay was good, job seemed relatively easy, was a no brainer. Should have checked Glassdoor, they had a sub 2 star rating and as soon as I started, it showed. Could have saved myself a lot of stress. \n\nThen again -- companies show very little loyalty to employees, and if you really need a job, just take it, do the work, take their money, and know you'll be moving on as soon as you feel is necessary.",

If they’re really great that can be the result of campaigning by the employer and if they’re terrible that can be disgruntled or underperforming employees lashing out.

That isn’t a rhetorical question. Something is prompting you to leave a known situation where you’re seemingly happy. Glassdoor reviews or no, any new job carries a ton of risk that you won’t be as happy. Do the benefits of that jump outweigh the risks?",

After all the research on the current state of the app, it appears that followers don't matter and every post starts essentially from scratch, no matter your following. \n\nWhy have followers if my posts won't be shown to them? I've had multiple people DM or comment to say \"Hey! I haven't seen your posts in forever!\" Despite me posting every single day.\n\nI've tried new types of content (skits, story times, narrated process videos). I've tried 7 second long videos to two and a half minute long videos. I've tried short captions, long captions. Posting in the morning. Posting in the afternoon. Posting at 2 am. I've tried reels and carousels. One carousel got a random 50,000 views and the latest one I posted got 1,000 views.\n\nNone of it is helping and I feel like such a failure. My content has consistently held a similar vibe, no major changes but I also try to keep it fresh with new fun facts.\n\nI have no violations against my account. \n\nI solely rely on social media to market my books. I'm on YouTube, Pinterest, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram, with Insta being my biggest platform and Facebook being my best converter. (Don't even get me started on my low views on Facebook despite having 19k followers there)\n\nI've been marketing with social media so long that I don't even know how to market my novels without it, but I've been so stressed lately. It's embarrassing to have so many followers and get 20 likes on a post. \n\nI don't know what to do and the stress isn't helping.\n\nWhat I'm asking:\n\nIs Instagram working for your business? Are you generating sales and/or leads from it?\n\nAre your views similar to what they were 3 years ago? 2 years ago? Even last year?\n\nWhat platforms or strategies would you suggest for a business used to creating short form video content? \n\nThank you so much for any input. I'm at my wit's end.",

          "text": "Hey to answer your question, yes Meta is working for me. But I pay for advertising. Based on your post, I’m assuming you are not running ads? If you’re using Meta for marketing but without paying Meta, that’s always going to be more challenging. But it can still be done. \n\nI checked out your account. Your account is very niche. Basically almost all your recent posts are you doing a two person dialogue skit where you play both characters and you film with tight framing (close up of your face). And the topic is always cannibalism. Are all of your books about cannibalism? \n\nI’m not the target audience for this social media content and probably not for your books either, so I’m not sure what to suggest. I would just point out that your account is far toward the narrow-niche end of the spectrum on social media, so in other words it is polarizing. People who are very interested in cannibalism and who like watching and hearing you talk will enjoy your account, and everyone else will probably not be interested. I don’t think your account will have much general appeal outside of this niche, because you are so focused on it. This type of narrow niche can be both a good and a bad thing. If there is strong overlap between this content and the subject of your books then that is probably a good thing. \n\nThe question is, I guess, how big is this niche audience, are they finding you, do you have competitors in this niche that people currently prefer? Have google searches for your keywords (eg “cannibalism”) trended up or down over the past year? Do you have a creator account and have you noticed any trends in your metrics, for example shifting demographics? \n\nI hope this helps a little! I don’t really have advice but maybe this helps with perspective or ways to think about the issue.",

Instagram isn’t playing favorites if they like to they’ll see it. People keep trying to game it and hack it but it’s all interest and engagement based. You have to create content people want to share and engage with. That’s the biggest mover in the algo right now. I just had a video hit 1.5 mil views talking about how I met your mother in a video essay type way. I only have 14k followers. I constantly try different subjects and I heavily use trial reels for most reels before making them public to everyone. You might really need to stick with the one thing you’re really really good at and find different ways of making that type of content. People might like your work but they might want more expert insights and value out of you as well. Think of yourself as offering a service almost rather than just being entertainment even though the content can be entertaining. Think, does this this content teach something? Make them laugh? Is it insightful? Is it rage inducing? Try the video essay style for a while and really get used to making trial reels.",

For me, events can also be big opportunities to learn. Watch what people are doing at our booth, how they are interacting with our employees, maybe even pretent I'm a customer even people at the booth don't know me. Do something similar to learn about what other companies are doing. Walk, talk to other people at the event who don't know who I am, listen to what people are saying about us or about others. ",

Figured I’d give Google Ads a shot.\n\nStarted with performance max because AI is supposed to do the heavy lifting, right? But it just burned through cash trying to figure out what worked, spraying broad matches everywhere. Not great when you’re bootstrapped and need results immediately. Switched to search-only and things got way better, cheaper clicks, way more control. I’m sticking to exact and phrase matches for now, just to keep things tight.\n\n  \nDo you prefer Performance Max or Search-only?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c58ur06j1rlg1.png?width=1763&format=png&auto=webp&s=266de8fb4ef06c2d55e348fdd9217c45d08d1a0e\n\n",

That's because performance max was created to sell Google's shitty inventory. I like to describe it like this:\n\n> Imagine there was a billboard company. They have billboards all over the city. Many are in abandoned industrial estates, or obscured by trees. The only \"people\" seeing these poorly-located billboards are security cameras and the occasional drunkard, lost on his way home.\n\n> The billboard company notices no one wants to advertise in the industrial estates or behind trees. That's a problem for their bottom line.\n\n> After pondering this for a few days, the billboard company's sales manager has a eureka moment:\n\n> “Let’s create a product called Billboard Max. We’ll tell our customers they don’t need to do any work and we’ll take care of the placements for them. It’ll enable us to fill all our unwanted inventory.”\n\n> Rolex comes along and signs up to the Billboard Max package, thinking the billboard company knows best, has their interests at heart, and will show their ads in prime locations.\n\n> During the campaign, some of Rolex’s ads appear in great billboard locations, but they also appear in industrial estates and behind trees, mostly seen by robotic cameras and worthless passer-by's. They get lots of leads but no one seems to answer...\n\n> That’s Performance Max.\n\nWhen you use Google Ads you should do the following:\n\n* Search only (no display or search partners)\n\n* Exact match\n\n* Loads of negative search terms (be psychotic about this)\n\n* Tight location settings (located in)\n\n* No unknown demographics\n\nIf you must use performance max then it can only be safely used with competent bot protection. That stops the bots generating fake conversions so Google will be trained to send you human traffic instead of bots.",

I don't think so, but it may look amazing for those who never did type of work before.\n\nThe \"exponential\" improvement I've been seeing is much more technical like the size of the model and the speed of the software. It certainly looks much better for engineers. But usually still ignoring what we actually want and try to do. \n\nThe improvement may be a little late for Meta given the decline of Facebook.

Since AI is like a black box, and it's being more and more integrated into the platforms, I see a trend with marketers having less and less control over what is happening.",

When it first came out I thought it was just broad targeting repackaged, and broad targeting was something I rarely saw work unless the ad account already had thousands of conversions in it. I tested it a few times against interest targeting, didn't see much difference, and moved on.\n\n\n\nEventually I gave it another shot in some of my more active client accounts and it started outperforming everything else in certain accounts. What actually surprised me is that more recently I've seen it work in nearly brand new ad accounts too, which broad targeting almost never did. Even on very niche products where you'd think you need specific interest targeting to get results.\n\n\n\nThat said, I still don't think it's the blanket answer that Meta wants you to believe. In some ad accounts I manage, interest targeting still outperforms Advantage+ by a clear margin. Especially when the product appeals to a very specific buyer rather than a broad market.\n\n\n\nWhat I do now with every new client is launch both at the same time. One interest targeting campaign, one Advantage+, same ads in both, and let the data tell me which one that particular ad account responds to better. And even after you find a winner, that can flip. I've had accounts where Advantage+ crushed it for months and then stopped, and interest targeting came back and started pulling a 7x ROAS on day one of relaunching it.\n\n\n\nThe real answer is don't marry one approach. Test both and stay flexible because what works in an ad account shifts constantly.",

Now I've learned to take advantage of the deals often offered by companies via email, but I don't open any newsletters regularly (despite being an avid reader and subscribing to high quality content).\n\nThe few people I know that use their email interface often beyond logistics, are 50+ years old.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\nIs it just a coincidence that I'm consistently only meeting non-email people? I do meet an unusually high number of people, but obviously it's still not a huge sample size. \n\nIs email marketing in general just for a niche type of person? Which in a world of 8 billion people, is more than enough. \n\nIs it a generational trend that will dwindle as the older population passes on or transitions to social media?\n\nWhat difference do you see in engagement for newsletters vs just basic promotional emails offering a deal? \n\nWhat trends do you expect to see in email marketing over the next 10 years?",

Most people ignore cold email.\n\n2) engagement is highly dependent on who sent it, what they sent, when they sent it, why they sent it. People engage, but differently and at different times. And it’s partly psychological. In the market for new platform X? Maybe keeping an eye even if just passively. Just signed up for platform Y? Quite likely to engage with some onboarding, activation, expansion stuff.\n\n3) We can *mostly* separate human vs machine opens at this point, so you can tell who is actually engaging and how often. But how this looks on your end really depends on how good your lists are and how good your program is.\n\n\nI could go on, but in general I both agree and disagree with your sentiment for different reasons, but based on the engagement and revenue I’ve seen from the email channel in my career, and continue to see to this day… the channel works.

With about maybe $800, I have been able to land our name in over 5 states (5 being where we had public push to formally register, and the \"over\" being where there's more demand to do but that's pending). And most of those 800 were registration fees with respective Sec of states. Rest of it is little things like print, mailing some things, maybe an order here and there. As a 100% volunteer nonprofit, there's an expectation some of the cost is offloaded because nobody is salaried. And despite turnover which ofc is a real thing with all nonprofit's, it's been working well enough it seems.\n\nNow, we don't really get donations, but that hasn't been a big push (no fundraising talent to strategize, and personally, not enough time overseeing everything to sit down and talk fundraising).\n\nSo, growth has been organic, and nearly \"free\". By free I mean, we don't spend money, but we ofc spent time.\n\nMarketing, and why I post here: things like email campaigns (we have over 1k emails), social media posts (we have maybe 5k combined followers/subs), and professional network (emails/phones of colleagues in Congress, state government, and other small to big names nonprofits and businesses) tend to be more conversational, and less like everything we announce is viral, if that makes sense. I see something more traditional like a billboard or tv commercial as \"viral\" in that people actually see and talk about it, in a sustained way. Even if one person only really talks about it once, the layers of people talking about it goes on for months, in some cases, years. Those dumb Kars4Kids radio commercials? People still meme on them today. From a branding and messaging POV, clearly successful.\n\nBut like per cost, as well as connection/medium, I guess I'm still learning that.\n\nThe $50k is currently outside of our budget. Though, the IRS just gave us 501c3 a month ago, and we will be beginning grant applications soon, and could easily hit 50k pretty fast in the next 1-2 years though those dollars would be a bit more conditional in use. So, as we start accruing spending capital, the businesswoman in me is thinking about using it in a ROI manner, and not being wasteful or inefficient about it. And for other readers no, my mind isn't going into investing it into 100% fundraising campaign as ROI, as data shows doing something compelling yields more donations than just asking for it nicely. Also the two don't have to be distinct, ie looking to spend money but in a manner that is being strategized really well to also land more reach and donors.\n\n(First consultant, ie \"overspending\": I gave a hypothetical budget with some marketing costs originating from real world quotes I got when emailing out, from contractors I won't nameshame, but who my 1st consult said seemed to be marking up where we could get by just as well at like 15-30% the cost. And that 70-85% savings is like, come on. You have to at least really consider it)",

I want to see good reasons and some evidence that the investment is worth it. That's true in general, like advertising, research, machinery, new employees, stocks, etc.\n\nIf the company can't get good results organically, for example, paying may just multiply the mistakes the company is doing organically.\n\nDifferent forms of promotion have different advantages and disadvantages. Companies often don't trust word of mouth because they can't control it. But customers often trust word of mouth better because companies can't control it.\n\nInstead of thinking of each alternative separately, it's better to me to think about the promotion mix in this case. In a way that matches my strategy and context, including your budget. Even if something is good, if that makes the company bite more than it can chew, it's not really a recommendation. I'd probably go back to improving strategy like targeting better.",

The structure and positioning take longer.\n\nWhat slowed me down in the past was defining who it was actually for. “Social media marketing” is too broad. Once you narrow it to a specific use case or maturity level, outlining gets much faster.\n\nMarketing it is a different challenge. Distribution tends to matter more than the curriculum. If you do not already have an audience or client base, expect that to take as much effort as building the course itself. I would validate demand early with a small beta before investing months into recording and polishing.",

Instead of trying to cover every platform, you could focus on something like LinkedIn growth for B2B brands or TikTok strategies for small creators. That makes it way clearer who the course is for and what problem it actually solves.\n\n\n\nAnd your 5,000 engaged LinkedIn followers are definitely a help. You don’t need millions, having an audience that actually interacts with your content gives you credibility and a first group to test the course with. People trust results they can see, not just big numbers.",
