We now have entire threads where every single commenter is a bot or a shill.\n\nLet me give an example. \n\nA user called milli_xoxxy creates the thread \"Looking for Livestorm alternatives\" in r/Marketing.\n\nThere are 13 comments from 10 different accounts. The entire thread (all 13 comments) are spam accounts faking engagement and pushing the conversation towards a service called \"Contrast\". Basically Contrast are scamming people with fake accounts and fake positive reviews.\n\nWe now have to remove the majority of posts and comments from r/Marketing as they're either spam accounts or bot accounts.\n\nWe have probably the most active moderation on Reddit, yet the subreddit is being completely overrun by fake posts and comments. If you look at other subreddits, you'll see there isn't even an attempt to remove this scam content.\n\nMost of the users on Reddit are now spammers or bots, and the Reddit admins don't care. 🤷",

If there is a substantial number of marketers and salesmen falling for this slop, then the industry has a bigger problem than a random subreddit being flooded by bots.\n\nLLMs, on the other hand? Well, they soak up these reddit threads like a paper towel. And the people behind these spam accounts know that. Their only goal is to manufacture fake conversations about their tools or services, and because most of the time \"real\" people will just skip past these fake threads at the moment they realize they're filled with bots, all that remains are these bots. And all that a LLM then sees are these \"conversations\" that remain, which to a crawler seem just as genuine as a normal, real conversation.\n\nThis is a \"hack\" that some try to use to slip their way into LLM recommendations. I don't know how effective it is, though, but judging by the sheer amount of these hacks, I'd say it's pretty effective.",

I don’t judge anyone, especially in my industry, for using AI occasionally to save valuable time and energy.\n\nThe problem I am running into is senior colleagues using it to generate all of their copy for major campaigns and initiatives.\n\nFor example, our Chief Advancement Officer just sent me 3 pages of copy she wants me to put on the website for our major capital campaign, but it is all obviously chat GPT generated, generic, uninteresting, and even got a few key details wrong.\n\nMy title is Comms/Marketing Manager - do I have grounds to rewrite what she sent me? She is senior to me so I don’t feel comfortable confronting her about using AI or asking her to use it less.\n\nShould I just do what she says and put it on the website as is?\n\nThis has happened multiple times recently, with senior colleagues sending me generic AI content and expecting me to share it or put it on the site.\n\nAny tips on how to deal with this in the least awkward way possible?",

I suppose you could have a boss that gets defensive of their work, but if AI did it all, they might appreciate the extra effort.\n\nAlso, you can prompt ChatGPT to customize stuff to not come off so AI-ish. I usually get a first draft, then give detailed guidance to help shape it to be more natural or fitting the tone of the company or a natural voice.\n\nOne cool thing I do (at least I think it’s cool), is to have ChatGPT write a longer article, go back and forth to get things more natural or conversational, then ask it to break it up into 4-6 smaller, independent “segments”. That way you can get more content out of it, and can do something like a themed content week or slow drip of content that’s all related.",

If you submit that copy as is what are the long term ramifications to you and the company?\n\nIf little to none - submit it and move on. \n\nIf the impact is measurable and you deem it significant, have a genuine convo with them but make sure you choose your words very carefully. You are not trying to preach to them about chat gpt, and you want to have actual numbers to back yourself up just in case. Maybe a few case studies/data sets on AI slop vs human created copy and how it performs. Tell them you are happy to do whatever they decide is best, but you have some concerns about sending the copy as is. \n\nIt’s all important to keep it on “I” statements and not on “you” statements. Say something like “I was previously at “X company doing Y task and I was using chatGPT for all of my company because it freed up so much time for me to handle more urgent tasks, but I noticed that the performance of my campaigns dropped off significantly. What I started doing was using chatGPT to generate the content but then manually went through and revised it, not only for accuracy but also to make it feel more human. Once I did that the performance picked back up. Would you mind if I made some revisions to your copy? When I was reading through it I immediately thought of my past experience - I think if I even just sat with it for an hour I could get it to perform substantially better.” And let them speak. \nStay away from “you used ChatGPT on this whole thing and it —--“ etc\n*Note* replace experience at X with research you’ve been doing and just show them the findings, or anything else relatable. I think you catch my drift. \n\nIf they push back, how important is this to you?\n\nIf a portion of your job switched primarily to signing off on AI slop, could you live with that? My advice would be take a step back, think of what the worst possible + the most probable outcomes might be if you decide to take action or let it go. Then, balance those between the status quo and act accordingly.",

Not because of lack of stability, but because too many people in demand generation don't seem to know what they are doing. \n\nIn your case, if you position yourself well, if you network properly, it seems project management would be a possibility. But it's more about using your experience and developing relationshios than relying on certifications.\n\nNow, for marketing instead of demand generation, I never saw any reason to pivot out of marketing. I could change a lot but still in marketing. Work with the finance-marketing interface. Work with marketing consulting. Work with entertainment marketing. Work with international marketing. Work with data analytics in marketing. Work in academia. Work with new product development. Marketing is so big that can include almost anything, I've seen people from tons of fields in marketing. I've had been in events related to cyber security, for example, and I probably could do something like that in marketing if I wanted to.\n\nAbout stable fields. If I wanted something more stable, probably I'd go back to Finance. But I see no reason to move back to that. Finance tends to be more stable, but it doesn't give the wide range of opportunities that I found in marketing. I'm from the time when marketers were expected to be trendsetters and game changers, so I often don't want stability, I want change. \n\nAnd, although marketing as a field is not stable, humans are still humans, markets are still markets. So, that part is very stable to me. \n\nLots of things that I do in marketing have been basically the same for decades in marketing strategy and marketing analytics, just with some eventual updates like learning new tools. I may do my marketing analytics using R now, but old stuff like descriptive statistics, experiments, regression, statistical biases, sampling, correlation not implying in causation, and Garbage In Garbage Out are still basically the same.",

Not “content → form fill → MQL”.  \nActual demand creation... especially in a zero-click world.\n\nA couple of angles I’m curious about, and would love real examples on:\n\n**1) What does demand gen** ***look like*** **when buyers don’t visit your site?**  \nIf influence is happening in communities, peer conversations, marketplaces, AI search, review sites... what outcomes are you aiming for? How do you know it’s working?\n\n**2) What are you measuring instead of leads?**  \nSome ideas I’ve been circling (but haven’t seen formalised well):\n\n* Quality of first sales conversations (e.g. “I don’t know what I’m looking for” vs “I know what you do, please help me solve *this* problem”)\n* Less wastage upstream (fewer junk enquiries rather than more MQLs)\n* Shorter time to meaningful conversations\n* Better alignment between sales narrative and buyer expectations\n\n**3) How are you explaining this to leadership?**  \nNot dashboards for the sake of it — but *what evidence* convinces people that demand is being built even if attribution is messy or incomplete?\n\nThis feels like a fundamentals problem, not a tooling one.  \nWe’re changing where and how demand is created, but still trying to measure it with the same old instruments.\n\nIf you’ve found signals that actually work (or you’re still wrestling with it...)

As long as we all keep playing the game of showing our mqls against lead source every month, etc, that's never gonna change. \n\nthere's still a separate dynamic that does need measurement - a/b testing of specific content types, channels, messaging etc. But I guess that's in-platform, and lot more heavily lifting to effectively match it to outcomes.",

Currently I’m organizing a huge event in Vegas including all the 25 people going there, their teams for their external demonstrations, hotel, flights, all admin including dinners, team events. I am preparing the stand messaging, design, and build. I’m preparing press. Social media. All the content around that and needed assets. Ads. But at the same time time I need to work on the rest of the marketing goals for the year and have random admin tasks that have little to do with marketing. Each of these is a huge undertaking, because none of these are straightforward and simple, and everyone I work with has a shit ton of feedback and like to change things up to literally the day of. Think this attitude: it’s fine if we don’t print the vinyl for the stand even if it’s the day of it’s an easy go to quickly adjust design, print it, and slap it over x area. OR: for this press release, let’s ignore reaching out to the people who provided quotes until literally after we’ve sent the press release off because „we can always add it later“and „if they say they need it by x, they don’t really mean it“- not taking into account that maybe it’s also because I hav 1000 things I need to do at once and it would be nice to follow a timeline that makes me not want to off myself. Maybe it’s cause I’ve been at startups only. It’s cool on one hand when things are going good. But lately I just hate it. I’m just here for my portfolio. This event I need to share a room for 2 -3 weeks. I have a chronic condition but I can hardly mention I’m in debilitating pain every night because everyone is in th same boat an they’ll look down on me like I’m not pulling my weight when everyone else is. Since I’m organisieng everything I tried to get rooms for everyone, it wasn’t approved. I tried to get a card for everyone, or at least a stipend they get paid before (I just assume most people don’t want to pay 3 meals per day in an expensive US city for 2 weeks out of their own pocket), and this was also shot down. I feel like I’m the weid one for pushing back on things like: organise a party for after the event. Or during at like 9pm. I just think absolutely not. People will be dead. We need to clean up and pack. Then fly back 18 hrs the next day. And I’m supposed to also organise that? Like I’m going to be DEAD. At the end of each day. Like… is this normal??? Or am I just complaining too much.",

You’re not just doing marketing, you’re acting as event manager, project manager, ops, admin, and emotional buffer for everyone else’s bad planning.\n\nWhat you’re describing is classic startup chaos where everything is treated as flexible except the one person actually responsible for execution. People saying we can change it last minute or we can add it later are usually not the ones staying up late fixing it or dealing with vendors, press, or logistics when things go wrong.\n\nThe room sharing and lack of stipend is honestly a red flag, especially given you have a chronic condition. That’s not you being difficult, that’s basic duty of care. The fact you even tried to advocate for reasonable stuff and got shut down says a lot about the culture.\n\nYou’re also not wrong about the exhaustion. Events like this are brutal even with a full team. Doing it solo while still expected to hit yearly marketing goals is not sustainable, and it’s normal that you’re burnt out and angry.\n\nIf you stay, you probably need to set firmer boundaries and force prioritisation in writing. If you’re mainly there for portfolio, I’d quietly get this event done, document the hell out of it for your CV, and start planning your exit. You’re not complaining too much.

It feels like the more I try to help the algorithm the more I actually mess it up. I was spending hours refining audiences just to get a lower return than when we just let the machine do the work. My best performing campaigns right now have literally zero interests or lookalikes and just rely on the creative to find the buyer. Are we finally at the point where manual targeting is just a waste of time for everyone or am I just getting lucky with the recent updates?",

          "text": "I'm a marketnig strategist with marketing analytics who moved from finance to marketing. Maybe because I was in finance before, ROI is very important to me. I don't like to waste money. \n\nI think more like a sniper. I don't want to use a machine gun, shooting a lot of bullets. I prefer to use only a few bullets, but be very effetive when doing that. As much as I can, I want every shot to count. \n\nSo, I want to analyze the situation very well before shooting. That's basically marketing research and marketing anaytics.\n\nI want to get to the right position before shooting. That's positioning in marketing.\n\nI want to aim well before shooting. That's targeting in marketing. \n\nAfter I analyze the situation, have my positioning strategy, have my targeting strategy, then I shoot. That's when ads, content, and SEO may happen. However, I don't want to shoot everywhere. Actions should follow strategy to me. I don't like when people shoot first and ask later. \n\nYou basically mentioned Promotion. But there are times when my analysis showed that the problem was elsewhere. Maybe the product portfolio is wrong. Maybe it's too expensive. Maybe there are problems with distribution and delivery. Even with promotion, maybe my communication is targeting the wrong audience. \n\nUsually, ads are the lasts step in the process for me because ads cost a lot of money, and I don't like spending money without being more sure about what I'm doing. That was true when investing in stocks in Finance, that's still true when investing in marketing actions. \n\nAds often come after I have a working strategy with good results and understanding with organic promotion, for example. That shows I'm probably ready to move to ads. \n\nAnd it's important to remember there are tons of forms of media. When I ask people why they are using a specific media, like happened a lot with TikTok in the last years, the answer often was \"because everyone\" is doing that. Not because that matched their strategies well. \n\nTheer are tons of people investing a lot of money in ads to get vanity metrics and bots, and that's the opposite of ROI to me.",

At least for me, it's a good starting point. \n\nI'm a professor now after working many years in the industry. \n\nOne of the challenges is that a lot of nonsense that we study during undergrad can make much more sense much later in our careers, if we reach that point.\n\nAlso, it's very important to remember that theory often simplifies things to make it easier to understand. Like problems of physics without attrition that don't apply to reality. So, being able to connect the dots and make the necessary jumps make a big difference. \n\nBut I don't recommend relying too much on books. Getting strong fundamentals is important to me to not be like an amateur, but experience and networking are very important.",
