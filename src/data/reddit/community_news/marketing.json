I don’t judge anyone, especially in my industry, for using AI occasionally to save valuable time and energy.\n\nThe problem I am running into is senior colleagues using it to generate all of their copy for major campaigns and initiatives.\n\nFor example, our Chief Advancement Officer just sent me 3 pages of copy she wants me to put on the website for our major capital campaign, but it is all obviously chat GPT generated, generic, uninteresting, and even got a few key details wrong.\n\nMy title is Comms/Marketing Manager - do I have grounds to rewrite what she sent me? She is senior to me so I don’t feel comfortable confronting her about using AI or asking her to use it less.\n\nShould I just do what she says and put it on the website as is?\n\nThis has happened multiple times recently, with senior colleagues sending me generic AI content and expecting me to share it or put it on the site.\n\nAny tips on how to deal with this in the least awkward way possible?",

I suppose you could have a boss that gets defensive of their work, but if AI did it all, they might appreciate the extra effort.\n\nAlso, you can prompt ChatGPT to customize stuff to not come off so AI-ish. I usually get a first draft, then give detailed guidance to help shape it to be more natural or fitting the tone of the company or a natural voice.\n\nOne cool thing I do (at least I think it’s cool), is to have ChatGPT write a longer article, go back and forth to get things more natural or conversational, then ask it to break it up into 4-6 smaller, independent “segments”. That way you can get more content out of it, and can do something like a themed content week or slow drip of content that’s all related.",

If you don't think it will reach your target audience, then your role is to make that happen and rewrite it.  \n\nIt's a good practice for a comms/marketing manager to have written personas for your target audience and to know the tone/voice of your brand/company.  If that is written well enough, your co-workers could upload that as part of the prompt.\n\nSo do you have a target persona and tone/voice as a company?",

If you submit that copy as is what are the long term ramifications to you and the company?\n\nIf little to none - submit it and move on. \n\nIf the impact is measurable and you deem it significant, have a genuine convo with them but make sure you choose your words very carefully. You are not trying to preach to them about chat gpt, and you want to have actual numbers to back yourself up just in case. Maybe a few case studies/data sets on AI slop vs human created copy and how it performs. Tell them you are happy to do whatever they decide is best, but you have some concerns about sending the copy as is. \n\nIt’s all important to keep it on “I” statements and not on “you” statements. Say something like “I was previously at “X company doing Y task and I was using chatGPT for all of my company because it freed up so much time for me to handle more urgent tasks, but I noticed that the performance of my campaigns dropped off significantly. What I started doing was using chatGPT to generate the content but then manually went through and revised it, not only for accuracy but also to make it feel more human. Once I did that the performance picked back up. Would you mind if I made some revisions to your copy? When I was reading through it I immediately thought of my past experience - I think if I even just sat with it for an hour I could get it to perform substantially better.” And let them speak. \nStay away from “you used ChatGPT on this whole thing and it —--“ etc\n*Note* replace experience at X with research you’ve been doing and just show them the findings, or anything else relatable. I think you catch my drift. \n\nIf they push back, how important is this to you?\n\nIf a portion of your job switched primarily to signing off on AI slop, could you live with that? My advice would be take a step back, think of what the worst possible + the most probable outcomes might be if you decide to take action or let it go. Then, balance those between the status quo and act accordingly.",

I’m getting really good vibes about the new company and I already have the offer letter, offering me a lot more financially and responsibility wise than my current role. I’ve made a list of the pros and cons and I’m heavily leaning towards taking the new role. There are no obvious red flags in my view. \n\nMy main hesitation is that this is a startup (higher risk) and I’m at a stage where I’m looking for stability due to where I’m at in my life.\n\nI’m also feeling intimated about stepping into such a senior position after a short period of time in this career, despite my broader professional experience. \n\nI’m not usually a risk taker but if I didn’t take this opportunity, I think I’d regret it. Has anyone made a similar leap? I know it’ll be a lot of work, but can you give me realistic advice about making this step?",

At early stage companies, head of marketing often means builder, operator, and firefighter all at once, not strategist with a team. The risk question is real, so I would get very clear on runway, expectations for the first 6 to 12 months, and what success looks like if things do not go perfectly. Feeling intimidated is normal, especially when the role jumps faster than the years suggest, but your prior career experience still counts a lot in leadership and decision making. If the company understands what they are hiring you for and you understand the tradeoffs, it can be a great learning curve. Regret usually comes more from unclear scope than from taking the risk itself.",

(Huge red flag in hindsight). \n\nWhether or not I was really “ready” for manager level 2 years ago was arguable, sure. Now? I most certainly am after the extensive skill and knowledge gain ive accrued after being at this 2nd company for years and the marketing industry for 4. My knowledge and skill are vastly beyond the other associate level employees currently on the team. They’ve had me working the same workload as the other managers mind you because theyve said they want to promote me (another huge red flag, I know).\n\nThen comes last week, company wide review time where promotions are given out. My boss let me know she put me forward for promotion consideration last November. I know the timeline of 2 years at the company works at associate level to get to manager level because that’s exactly the timeline for one of my coworkers.\n\nThen, not only do I find out this shit company added in an extra step before manager level (senior associate) and that’s what I was under consideration for, its not up to my boss - it’s up to the executives. This is a huge company and I never interact with them. I do like and trust my boss shes great but the executives are shit. And my boss let me know this week that the executives decided to not promote me to senior associate at this time as they want to see more of how I work at this manager level workload.\n\nMind you I was handed the manager level workload 3 months after I was initially hired 2 years ago. \n\nSo anyways yeah I know they’re blatantly taking advantage of me, they’re blatantly taking advantage of a lot of people at this company. And every time I doubt myself whether or not I’m really qualified to be at manager or senior manager or higher level, I look at some of my peers in marketing who are my same age and have my same years of experience and they are higher than me, and I remember that I have legitimately been working at manager level for 2 years now, just haven’t had the title. Oh and this company was about to hire me at manager level 2 years ago too.\n\nI’m hot on the job search, I have a very strong lead for manager level and I’m trying to get the fuck out of this shit place asap. I really, really want to leave this company high and dry with the conference I’m managing and not even give them my 2 weeks after this slap in the face - and for so many other reasons, a laundry list of grievances against this company and how they don’t treat me or any of us working there right. I hope this strong manager lead goes somewhere and then I’m gone in just a few weeks.\n\nMy point is: don’t be worried about whether or not you can handle it. If you like marketing, take this position. Being a head of a marketing team will be amazing for your resume and experience, and if you find you don’t like it and want a more low-stress option, you can do that later. With this under your belt, you’ll be able to pretty much do whatever level role you want in marketing forever after. That’s my advice since you’re at this early stage.",

Not because of lack of stability, but because too many people in demand generation don't seem to know what they are doing. \n\nIn your case, if you position yourself well, if you network properly, it seems project management would be a possibility. But it's more about using your experience and developing relationshios than relying on certifications.\n\nNow, for marketing instead of demand generation, I never saw any reason to pivot out of marketing. I could change a lot but still in marketing. Work with the finance-marketing interface. Work with marketing consulting. Work with entertainment marketing. Work with international marketing. Work with data analytics in marketing. Work in academia. Work with new product development. Marketing is so big that can include almost anything, I've seen people from tons of fields in marketing. I've had been in events related to cyber security, for example, and I probably could do something like that in marketing if I wanted to.\n\nAbout stable fields. If I wanted something more stable, probably I'd go back to Finance. But I see no reason to move back to that. Finance tends to be more stable, but it doesn't give the wide range of opportunities that I found in marketing. I'm from the time when marketers were expected to be trendsetters and game changers, so I often don't want stability, I want change. \n\nAnd, although marketing as a field is not stable, humans are still humans, markets are still markets. So, that part is very stable to me. \n\nLots of things that I do in marketing have been basically the same for decades in marketing strategy and marketing analytics, just with some eventual updates like learning new tools. I may do my marketing analytics using R now, but old stuff like descriptive statistics, experiments, regression, statistical biases, sampling, correlation not implying in causation, and Garbage In Garbage Out are still basically the same.",

At least for me, it's a good starting point. \n\nI'm a professor now after working many years in the industry. \n\nOne of the challenges is that a lot of nonsense that we study during undergrad can make much more sense much later in our careers, if we reach that point.\n\nAlso, it's very important to remember that theory often simplifies things to make it easier to understand. Like problems of physics without attrition that don't apply to reality. So, being able to connect the dots and make the necessary jumps make a big difference. \n\nBut I don't recommend relying too much on books. Getting strong fundamentals is important to me to not be like an amateur, but experience and networking are very important.",

Too many people spend hours trying to game an algo in the pursuit of more organic reach.\n\nThat’s why so much crap exists on the platform. The algo is not for gaming, and more reach is only worth it anyway if it’s relevant. \n\nCreate organic content as people - authentic, helpful, interesting etc\n\nPay for relevant reach to boost that organic directly into the newsfeeds that matter to you.\n\nIt’s like having your own private version of the algo.\n\nEngagement will still be low, but that’s because most people are in lurker mode most of the time.\n\nAnyway, you don’t need engagement - you need people to read and understand, and LinkedIn is still amazing for that.",

          "text": "I'm a marketnig strategist with marketing analytics who moved from finance to marketing. Maybe because I was in finance before, ROI is very important to me. I don't like to waste money. \n\nI think more like a sniper. I don't want to use a machine gun, shooting a lot of bullets. I prefer to use only a few bullets, but be very effetive when doing that. As much as I can, I want every shot to count. \n\nSo, I want to analyze the situation very well before shooting. That's basically marketing research and marketing anaytics.\n\nI want to get to the right position before shooting. That's positioning in marketing.\n\nI want to aim well before shooting. That's targeting in marketing. \n\nAfter I analyze the situation, have my positioning strategy, have my targeting strategy, then I shoot. That's when ads, content, and SEO may happen. However, I don't want to shoot everywhere. Actions should follow strategy to me. I don't like when people shoot first and ask later. \n\nYou basically mentioned Promotion. But there are times when my analysis showed that the problem was elsewhere. Maybe the product portfolio is wrong. Maybe it's too expensive. Maybe there are problems with distribution and delivery. Even with promotion, maybe my communication is targeting the wrong audience. \n\nUsually, ads are the lasts step in the process for me because ads cost a lot of money, and I don't like spending money without being more sure about what I'm doing. That was true when investing in stocks in Finance, that's still true when investing in marketing actions. \n\nAds often come after I have a working strategy with good results and understanding with organic promotion, for example. That shows I'm probably ready to move to ads. \n\nAnd it's important to remember there are tons of forms of media. When I ask people why they are using a specific media, like happened a lot with TikTok in the last years, the answer often was \"because everyone\" is doing that. Not because that matched their strategies well. \n\nTheer are tons of people investing a lot of money in ads to get vanity metrics and bots, and that's the opposite of ROI to me.",

I just moved a client from a massive list of interest stacks to zero targeting and our cost per lead dropped 30% overnight. It feels like the more I try to help the algorithm the more I actually mess it up. I was spending hours refining audiences just to get a lower return than when we just let the machine do the work. My best performing campaigns right now have literally zero interests or lookalikes and just rely on the creative to find the buyer. Are we finally at the point where manual targeting is just a waste of time for everyone or am I just getting lucky with the recent updates?",

Broad targeting leaves the door open for the algorithm to leverage the conversion data to its fullest. The problem is if you get the wrong audience to convert, it creates a death spiral of unqualified conversions (like the old ladies wanting the horse product lol). If that happens, you have to build a whole new campaign so it can retrain itself on better conversion data. \n\nThats just my experience.",

      "text": "This might be a naive question but I work for a startup. I’m the only marketing person. I hav a freelance designer who helps out 15 hrs a week and if I do have support, its freelancer. Currently I’m organizing a huge event in Vegas including all the 25 people going there, their teams for their external demonstrations, hotel, flights, all admin including dinners, team events. I am preparing the stand messaging, design, and build. I’m preparing press. Social media. All the content around that and needed assets. Ads. But at the same time time I need to work on the rest of the marketing goals for the year and have random admin tasks that have little to do with marketing. Each of these is a huge undertaking, because none of these are straightforward and simple, and everyone I work with has a shit ton of feedback and like to change things up to literally the day of. Think this attitude: it’s fine if we don’t print the vinyl for the stand even if it’s the day of it’s an easy go to quickly adjust design, print it, and slap it over x area. OR: for this press release, let’s ignore reaching out to the people who provided quotes until literally after we’ve sent the press release off because „we can always add it later“and „if they say they need it by x, they don’t really mean it“- not taking into account that maybe it’s also because I hav 1000 things I need to do at once and it would be nice to follow a timeline that makes me not want to off myself. Maybe it’s cause I’ve been at startups only. It’s cool on one hand when things are going good. But lately I just hate it. I’m just here for my portfolio. This event I need to share a room for 2 -3 weeks. I have a chronic condition but I can hardly mention I’m in debilitating pain every night because everyone is in th same boat an they’ll look down on me like I’m not pulling my weight when everyone else is. Since I’m organisieng everything I tried to get rooms for everyone, it wasn’t approved. I tried to get a card for everyone, or at least a stipend they get paid before (I just assume most people don’t want to pay 3 meals per day in an expensive US city for 2 weeks out of their own pocket), and this was also shot down. I feel like I’m the weid one for pushing back on things like: organise a party for after the event. Or during at like 9pm. I just think absolutely not. People will be dead. We need to clean up and pack. Then fly back 18 hrs the next day. And I’m supposed to also organise that? Like I’m going to be DEAD. At the end of each day. Like… is this normal??? Or am I just complaining too much.",

That is an extremely heavy workload for one person, and a lot of what you described is not even marketing work, it is ops and event logistics layered on top of strategy and execution. Startups do move fast and get messy, but constant last minute changes, ignoring timelines, and dismissing basic planning is a leadership problem, not a normal expectation. The fact that you are also dealing with a chronic condition makes the lack of consideration even more concerning. It is okay to acknowledge that this is not sustainable, even if startups often normalize burnout.

You’re not just doing marketing, you’re acting as event manager, project manager, ops, admin, and emotional buffer for everyone else’s bad planning.\n\nWhat you’re describing is classic startup chaos where everything is treated as flexible except the one person actually responsible for execution. People saying we can change it last minute or we can add it later are usually not the ones staying up late fixing it or dealing with vendors, press, or logistics when things go wrong.\n\nThe room sharing and lack of stipend is honestly a red flag, especially given you have a chronic condition. That’s not you being difficult, that’s basic duty of care. The fact you even tried to advocate for reasonable stuff and got shut down says a lot about the culture.\n\nYou’re also not wrong about the exhaustion. Events like this are brutal even with a full team. Doing it solo while still expected to hit yearly marketing goals is not sustainable, and it’s normal that you’re burnt out and angry.\n\nIf you stay, you probably need to set firmer boundaries and force prioritisation in writing. If you’re mainly there for portfolio, I’d quietly get this event done, document the hell out of it for your CV, and start planning your exit. You’re not complaining too much. You’re being asked to do an unreasonable amount and your body is telling you that clearly.",

          "text": "the biggest time-saver I've found for local Facebook ads isn't producing more creatives, it's knowing exactly when your current ones start dying so you're not refreshing prematurely or too late. What I'd do at $200/day-ish local spend: run 3-4 ad variations at a time and watch the CTR trend line at the ad level, not the ad set level. When an individual ad's CTR drops below your account average by 20%+ over a 3-day window, that's your signal to swap it out. Most people don't refresh enough or refresh way too often because they're guessing. For the actual creative production: batch it. Spend one afternoon per month shooting 15-20 short clips at the studio (students dancing, class energy, instructor moments) and screenshot 8-10 testimonials or reviews. That gives you enough raw material to remix into new ads weekly with just a Canva template swap. The \"fresh\" part that Meta's algorithm cares about isn't radical redesigns, it's new creative IDs with slightly different hooks and visuals. The benefit of lots of creatives is only tangible if the messaging, ad type, and demo representation in the assets are diverse, which meta auction rewards by unlocking unique reach. On the VA question: a VA for optimization is risky unless they deeply understand Meta's auction dynamics. What works better at your scale is having a clear system, a simple spreadsheet tracking CPL by ad by week and letting that data tell you what to change rather than relying on someone's gut.",

One great way to see if an agency knows their staff is to have them draw their approach/process for solving marketing problems on a white board. if they can’t, move on.\n\nLook for companies that have been in business more than ten years. Look up the people who run the agency. What did they do before they started the agency? was it unrelated to marketing? That’s a red flag. what is their education and in what field? It should be marketing or closely related. \n\nA good agency won’t be eager. They will be asking business questions to understand in detail if they can meet your objections. They won’t make promises or guarantees. \n\nMost agencies fail because of the client. Clients that don’t know what they want, have nobody in-house who understands marketing, doesn’t want to pay for planning, wants results immediately, have unrealistic budgets, don’t deliver approvals and input in a timely manner, don’t follow recommendations or picks and chooses parts of the strategy - if the agency is legit, it is usually the client who creates the failure state. \n\nIf the company is focused on tactics (for example a company that sells advertising will recommend advertising. A branding firm will tell you branding is the answer. a web dev company sells websites. when they only own a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\n\nFirst hire a consultant who really knows the marketing and business world on a temporary assignment to put together criteria and help you interview potential partners.

So I don't think you know enough about marketing, less how hiring a marketing firm works, to be demanding a partner be held to arbitrarily-set standards. \n\nThe proper process is:\n\nFirst you issue an RFP with a clearly stated *business problem.* You should include goals and desired outcomes, but those are not KPIs - those are to be agreed to later, once the plan is in place. Set a budget for discovery and strategic planning, and ensure a range for execution depending on the final scope so the firms know what they're dealing with. Give them three to six weeks to complete the pitch, depending on the size of the RFP. \n\nOnce you've got the RFP responses in, you select. At that point, you'll give them the actual campaign or project brief. If you are using the same one as the pitch, you let them go back to the board and do a proper Discovery, because everything they did in the pitch was hypothetical and based mostly on deskside research; once hired you are able to give them more access to the research and data they need to be more precise. \n\nThen, once you've gotten into the rounds of review in the strategic planning process, you'll agree to the right KPIs that support the business goals as stated in the brief. They may not be the ones you listed at all. But the plan is something everyone agrees to, and is the roadmap for performance of duties therein. That's what holds everyone, including you, accountable for all of the roles and responsibilities required to get you there.\n\nAnd also, before you do any of this, you need a real marketer on staff, because you don't appear to have any grasp of the most basic of facts: that Marketing has no control over what happens once they deliver you a lead, so if your site sucks, your value prop isn't clear, your checkout or sales process is shit, or your product is vaporware, you have no business demanding any KPI be met. Particularly KPIs you appear to have set in a vacuum.\n\nAlso, it's inappropriate to ask a marketing vendor to set up your sales funnel. That's something your Sales team is responsible for setting up in whatever CRM engine they've selected. Marketing can integrate with a number of CRM types, but you need to set the tone, because Sales will set that process and they'll be dicking around in it more. \n\nMarketing is a team sport, not a pyre upon which you place your marketing partner, douse it in your failure to deliver, and strike the clause that burns everything, including your money.",

You got some good comments here, but i wanted to add on top of what has been said.   \n  \nPlaylists: It's important that you make your own playlist and you treat is as an asset. I've seen people using \"this is: x\" or artist radio playlist. This is not ideal if you are getting the ball rolling. Very few people know you to keep listening to \"This is\", and a radio playlist is not ideal either, as it normally has one song from your catalog, and the rest are related songs but likely from different artists. \n\nMake a playlist that you like as a theme, eg workout music, travel playlist, etc and mix your music with known/popular tracks. This keeps the listener engaged, and exposed to your music/vibe at the same time. \n\nAds: UGC video creatives work. Dont need to overthink it, but it's important to test and keep in mind a caption that connects with the audience. eg \"new release out\" won't move the needle. With that said, setting up your own meta ads can imply big learning curve.\n\nOrganic: the challenge here is to post consistently. i am working on a new free tool that can help mostly with the creative making part. But it definitely helps and doesn't compete with ads at all. They work together very well. Also it doesn't have to be always branded content. Many artists believe they have to film themselves making music, sometimes yes but it is not mandatory to do it.\n\nHope this helps.",

      "text": "Howdy! I’m a founder of an education company with considerable marketing background, but I had never run google ads. I’m utterly stumped on what to include for images. Since we don’t have a physical product, there’s no real need for an image, and I positively despise the stock images of people around a whiteboard.\n\nI’m AI fluent, but AI returns a lot of cliched and creepy ideas. How do people go about deciding on images? Where do you look for inspiration? Thanks!",
