Sad.\n\nI’ve never seen a brand self sabotage this badly, until Ms. “Young Professional” over here thought it’d be a good idea to use “saw your name in the Epstein Files” as a clickbait headline for her email marketing her Valentine’s Day sale for her shitty influencer brand “FYPM.vip” / “f*ck you pay me”.\n\nInstead of apologizing or realizing you shouldn’t run a brand that’s “anti exploitation” using actual exploitation for marketing emails, she’s now claiming she’s “being cancelled”, “#babysfirstcancellation”, and instead of hiring a crisis PR firm, she is having a generational crashout on Instagram, claiming she’s just going to log off and come back when people have forgotten.",

It's a fine book.

A client sent me Traffic Secrets to read a couple years ago, and I don't remember learning anything from it. They all have a couple moments that you might want to write down for later, but none of them are the \"playbook\" they promise to be. They are usually a collection of personal examples used to pad out the word count on what could have been a blog post.",

I like to narrow it down to be specific about some things that already interest me. For instance, how did Reddit scale, how did AirBnB scale, how did Yelp scale, how did Instagram scale. \n\nThey each did it differently and they are each unique to their niche so its interesting to see what worked and what didnt work. Harvard Business Review Case Studies usually go in depth with what worked and didint work. All of this has helped me think about what to do, what not to do - or even how to think about things differently. \n\nThe only book for marketing I would recommend is Positioning: The Battle for your mind . Everyone needs to the know the basics and then you develop a unique strategy from there for whatever it is that you are marketing. I learned from someone a few years ago that \"Marketing is just creative problem solving\". If you know the basics of marketing, have a few examples of success and failures, then you have the tools to be creative with your problem solving to develop a marketing strategy. ",

In actuality, I’m not spending all day building my business because I love my family, which he doesn’t have other than his wife and would rather have less money but more time.\n\nThe best marketing principles come from personal development and human behavior, which is all marketing and sales is.\n\nI will vouch for the secrets series by Russell Brunson because there’s a lot of great information but mostly for info marketing. It applies and he speaks directly to product marketing as well but the reality is that products have way more financial requirements like stock, inventory, seasons, etc., and aren’t as easy to pivot so this won’t be as useful.",

I've closed multiple five figure deals through cold outreach, but it requires genuine research about the company's actual pain points and a clear value proposition in the first sentence. Most people skip the research part and wonder why their open rates are trash.\n\nThis kind of approach gives all cold emailers a bad name when done properly its one of the highest ROI growth channels for B2B companies.",

And it reeks of low effort, contempt for your audience, and inauthentic delivery. \n\nI’ve always been an ethical marketer through my career. I’ve used trust, authenticity and belief in the products or services I market to offer something genuinely helpful and of meaningful substance to my customers. \n\nThoughts from my fellow marketers?

I can’t even explain exactly why AI upsets me so much, I guess I just appreciate effort and I don’t want to see my friends and family get replaced by robots.\n\nI used to have an entire niche business writing copy for indie musicians. After AI came out, that unfortunately dried up, and I had to pursue opportunities I was far less passionate about to keep making money.\n\nNow, just this past week, I handed my boss a ten page report that I wrote myself and he told me “I don’t like it when people use ChatGPT to write such long reports. I’m not gonna read it. Next time ask it to summarize it into 150 words instead.”\n\nEvery brief I get from management is obviously written by AI. People from other departments keep forwarding me articles about how marketers who aren’t leveraging Claude Cowork are leaving money on the table.\n\nI have been sad and directionless for a long time. I used to feel like I had a purpose. Now i just feel like a vector through which AI slop is moved from point A to point B. It is soul crushing.\n\nAnyway here’s a couple em dashes for you and cheers from Vancouver — — —",

Opus 4.6 and GPT 5.2 are plenty capable if you give them enough context and direction. Sure if you just say hey write an article or copy about XYZ and that’s it, you can’t expect it to be great. But if you give it enough context and tell it exactly what to do with writing guidelines, it’s going to come out near perfect. Nano Banana 2 creates near perfect images in seconds. Sora 2 and Veo 3 make ok videos but that will continue to improve. All of this is continuing to improve every month. Human creativity is still valued, but now anyone with creativity can have AI work for them super quickly to make their ideas come to life. ",

And even in that short space of time, the impact social media and constant churning out shite to please an algorithm didn’t sit well with me. I kept up with it and learned how to edit videos when that became popular too. \n\nThe turning point for me was on a random Wednesday in early 2022 when Meta went down. I was getting calls from clients screaming telling me their ad spend is being wasted and that our scheduled posts weren’t going live. I remember being on the phone til 11pm dealing with panicked clients. That was the day I decided to pivot. \n\nStupidly, I pivoted into copywriting. And six months later ChatGPT went live. The irony isn’t lost on me but I have been able to carve out a decent career for myself. In saying that, crappy bosses will always want to maximise output so AI will be continuously pushed, it’s just about staying slightly ahead and being alert.",

A small ad in a tabloid newspaper was for smaller brands. \n\nI suspect the same will happen now, except nobody was claiming the tabloid ad was better then the glossy ad in the past. \n\n  \nMy other fear is that we've become so obsessed with the shortest route to profit, that we forget to provide value.

All borrow someone else’s craft to improve another person’s product. It’s a tool. What bothers me is all the uncomfortable truths it’s revealing. BoDs and VCs enthusiastically demand its widespread use and push it downstream and everyone has to accept the impacts. As long as something gets produced quickly, cheaply and without any human friction, what’s produced doesn’t even matter. Only output matters. There’s a strange nonchalance or even eagerness for a future where hundreds of thousands of people can’t find work, as if the social impacts are someone else’s problem. Above all, it unmasked how much people don’t care. The sloppiness of AI gives them permission to be the sloppiest version of themselves because they can just hide in the noise……..and they just don’t care.",

At first I thought it was a mistake or people not understanding how digital works, but it's happening way too often to be random.\n\nI'm trying to understand the reasoning here. If someone's scrolling Instagram on their phone, why would they screenshot your post, save it to photos, open the image, and then scan the QR code instead of just tapping a link in your bio or swiping up on a story?\n\nAnd I've seen QR codes in LinkedIn carousel posts where the caption literally has a clickable link right there. What's the logic?\n\nI run a small marketing agency and a client recently asked me to add QR codes to their social graphics. I pushed back because the workflow seems clunky, but now I'm seeing bigger brands doing it too. So either I'm missing something or everyone's collectively lost their minds.\n\nFor those of you actually using QR codes on social media and seeing results, I'd love to understand the channels you're putting them on and why those specific ones. I want to know if you're tracking scans vs regular link clicks and whether people are actually using them or just following a trend.",

The conversation went along the lines of:\n\n* \"Oh, are we printing these on a poster and/or handing them out?\"\n* \"No, we're just going to post them on LinkedIn, emailing them out, and our website.\"\n* \"Then why do we need a QR code...?  A QR code is for giving people a link when they're out in the physical world.  In the digital world--like online--they just click a link.\"\n* \"But we should have a QR code so they can scan it with their phones.\"\n* \"On their phones, they also click a link.  Do you think someone would be on their computer on LinkedIn, and then they see this, and then they pull out their phone and point it to their laptop screen to go to the website that they can just click...?  Or if they were on LinkedIn on their phone, they wouldn't just click the link right next to it, in order to get to the event site...?\n* (silence)....\"But everyone does QR codes.\"\n* \"When is the last time ***you*** scanned a QR code on your computer screen when you also had a link right next to it...?\"\n* \"Like at a restaurant to get the menu.  I just did this at lunch yesterday!\"\n* \"...because you were physically there, in the real world.  And you didn't have a hyperlink you could just click.  How else would the restaurant give you a link to an online menu?  If you googled the restaurant menu on your phone, google wouldn't give you search results in the form of a QR code.  They'd give you a link to click.  A QR code is for when you see something in real life and want to go to the associated website on your phone.\"\n* (silence)....\"But you did the QR codes for that other event.\"\n* \"Because we had physically printed banners, displays on kiosks, and little postcards.  We didn't use QR codes for the online stuff.\"\n* \"I just think we'll get a lot of people scanning the QR code.  We need to let them be able to get to the site with the info.\"\n* (facepalm)\n\nYou asked about the \"reasoning.\"  There it is.\n\nOccasionally, the QR codes for online stuff comes from reusing assets that were originally designed for print (like at a trade show, you might give them some swag and a postcard...or a banner at a booth).  But even in these cases, you typically can just turn off that layer--and I think it's usually cleaner to do so.",

          "text": "At least you get that far.  I've been places where the job is just trying to get into meetings.  As in, try to join, but for some reason you need to be on the vpn to access teams--so try to connect to the vpn, get out your authenticator app on your phone, wait for the next set of numbers because this set will be done by the time you type it, try to open teams, it crashes, so then try to open a private window or different browser, type your name, wait for someone let to you in.\n\nThe key is:  at places like that, don't worry about getting work done.  It's the effort that counts.  If companies wanted you to get work done, they'd make it easy to do so and they'd give you time to do so.  Instead, they add overhead to try to micromanage and force you to be present for a set amount of time--and they want you to invest 100% of the cost of the overhead and get the work done on your own time.\n\nSync ups are managers' way of knowing what you're doing so they can get credit (and compensation) for coordinating it.  If this communication takes as long as it takes to do the work, the manager is really bad at their job.  Their job is to build a process to minimize distraction (including themselves) and maximize your productivity--the quality / quantity of what you produce.\n\nBut nah.  The quality of your work should reflect (at least in part) the amount of effort that actually went into it.  If you've got 5 minutes in-between meetings to make graphics, you should be commended for drawing a stick figure in paint and typing some words below it.  Make sure to spend an extra 5 minutes explaining why it is so shitty.\n\nThey're going to attempt to replace you with AI anyway, citing efficiency.  Efficiency being the very thing that they made worse in their micromanagement efforts.\n\n(BTW, I'm actually on the executive management side of things, and I hate when this sort of thing happens--unfortunately all too commonly.  It tends to happen more at larger corporations and much less at smaller startups).",

The average buyer also buys more than one more brand, and for any given brand, the bulk of their buyers are light buyers (i.e most people that buy coke buy it occasionally but will also drink pepsi occasionally). \n\nResearch shows that brands grow through market penetration. Brands that have higher market penetration (i.e more buyers) also tend to have more loyal buyers. You can’t grow a brand by differentiating yourself and focusing on a narrow segment to try and form a loyal base of heavy users. Yet that is the common advice of the last 10–15 years: hyper personalization and differentiation. \n\nWhat works is creating memory structures through distinctive assets that make it easy to recall the brand in buying moments. UVPs and differentiation only work in so far as you need to have some kind of messaging. If it’s distinctive (in tone, language, etc.), people will remember it more easily.",

          "text": "I think there are different issues here. \n\nFirst, yeah, there are brands without differentation. There are many companies that neglect different parts of marketing strategy like differentiation and positioning, and jump to promotion. \n\nBut that's far from being something to generalize. \n\nSecond, too many marketers don't see differentiation even if that's right in front of them. Maketing myopia is back in force. Too many marketers see things from a marketer's perspective but don't understand the customers' perspective. And positining is in the mind of the target audience, not in the mind of maketers. Different companies may look the same superficially if marketers take a superficial look at them. But that's not that common when we analyze them deeply, especially when we get to the customers. \n\nThird, context matters. For example, depending on the country, financial services are strongly regulated, limiting many aspects of marketing like differentiation. Commodities are undifferentiated by definition. \n\nFourth, it may be important to remember that relationships are expcted to be an important part of maketing. It's not about the product or the brand by themselves, but the relationship we develop. Retailers may sel the same product from the same brand and supplier, for example, but develop relationships in very different ways. \n\nFifth, emotions are very subjective by nature. What is a small emotional differentiation for you may mean a major differentation for the right target audience. In marketing, often small is big. We can do a lot with small emotions, we can do a lot with seconds of attention, we can do a lot without much money, we can do a lot without much people. Leveraging those small emotions can be very important for brands. \n\nUsing what we learn from books, I think it's important to understand the different levels of differentiation and not kee the analysis superficial. There are tons of sources of differentiation. Even for products, we have levels like core, actual, and augmented product. Another user mentioned some time ago about risk reduction. \n\nI recommend using marketing analytics like positioning maps. They often can reveal differentiation even when we don't see them at first.",

So instead of committing, companies retreat back into what everyone else is doing.\n\nAnother big issue is trying to sell to everyone.\n\nReal differentiation means being clear about who you’re for and who you’re not for. And that’s not easy. It means saying no, making trade-offs, and trusting your judgment. Most teams don’t want that responsibility.\n\nSo what happens?\nYou get surface-level differentiation. Different logos, slightly different messaging, same products, same promises. Everyone chasing the next shiny thing because it feels safer than committing to a point of view.\n\nSo I don’t think what we’re taught is wrong.\nI think most companies just don’t have the courage to do it.",

This is one of the most common misunderstandings marketers have. \n\nOnly in a minority of cases does it really matter: e.g., strategic B2B purchases where differentiation can be defined in concrete monetary terms and in the creation of new product categories.\n\nBut superficial differentiation does matter. And that’s where brand assets like mascots and other icons play an important role. So literally brand differentiation as opposed to product/service differentiation.\n\nThis gets at the heart of what’s really wrong with new businesses. They don’t have a differentiation problem. They have an efficiency/focus problem.\n\nMarkets have a very high tolerance for clones and redundancy.\n\nMarketers would be better off modeling after successful firms than trying to be different.

This is why brand power is becoming more important - your view/perspective.

Differentiation should be sustainable and I think nature of differentiation is being sustainable. If you are able to sustain this upperhand like if you are able to innovate new ground breaking feature every 6 month before everyone copy from you, than this can be a differentiation. I am not familiar with B2b SaaS but what come to my mind as examples of differentiation point, it can be you be the innovator like I mentioned earlier, or you can be the cheapest like outsourcing work to third world countries but lack of some features or have low quality softwares, another differentiation can be you may not be innovator or cheapest but when you copy, you did it perfectly so it work seamless and intuitive like apple did with apple vision pro. All these have their unique value propositions and unique customers. If you argue that this is not possible or will not work I would like to hear",

Companies spent their research dollars creating better CD players.  Apple changed that. They got rid of the CDs and created a device that played mp3 files directly. Sales of the iPod skyrocketed.\n\nWhy?  Because people wanted music, not a better CD player.  The iPod was a huge hit because it satisfied all three of the criteria above; the ease of playing music was important, the lack of CDs was unique enough that it could be promoted easily, and the portability and song-quantity of the iPod made a big difference in their lives.\n\nThat’s true differentiation.  \n.  \n",

This is a concept from Interbrand - “Role of Brand Index” . The takeaway for me is, what we learn in school and through books needs to be adjusted by, among other things, the category we’re looking at. \n\nI would also look into Kantar’s MDS framework - meaningful, different, salient. Kantar’s research ties brand equity to market performance. Strong brands enjoy a series of benefits others don’t. Download their brand blueprint, check out their Top 100 brands. \n\nAfter this, you’d have the right context and nuanced understanding to look at something like How brands grow. \n\nLastly, in my experience, a lot of people work in marketing that did not necessarily go to school for it. FWIW, my undergrad is in Advertising, and I have a MS in Marketing. I notice that most of them lack the nuanced understanding of the fundamentals. In other words, there is a lot of bad marketing all around us. Even when they have agencies that “do everything” client still needs to approve and guide the right kind of work. “Great work is only for great clients”",

I'm seeing the writing on the wall that they're trying to shut our office down, about half of the team has quit and no one is being replaced.

Not just work he assigned to me, but work that our mutual corporate overlords have included in the overall corp marketing plan and devote staff, budget and time towards executing. \n\nI did in the moment and will continue to counter his objections, which amount to “our audience is only on LinkedIn”. That’s demonstrably false. He just doesn’t understand marketing outside of endemic channels. He also has the very boomer belief that “the kids are using fb and instagram and adults are using LinkedIn”. \n\nI guess I’m just expressing the frustration of being a marketing professional working for a non-marketing professional and having to educate them on things that are understood by anyone else as inherently valuable or at least required.

But if you haven't demonstrated how he's wrong and you're just upset he's brushing you off, that's a different story.

Otherwise you're mostly capped at what you can do as an individual. Outside the corporate world you can get leverage through other means like making big, bold bets with huge payoff potential.",

I think there are two skills or groups of skills that changed the game for me:\n\n\\- Networking if you include social skills. Social skills often get much more important for higher jobs related to leadership, management, teams, and corporate politics. And that can lead to a much higher income.\n\n\\- Marketing analytics with data analytics, statistics, coding. Analytics can be very helpful to see what others are not seeing, develop better strategies, get stronger evidence to make better decisions, and get better results. Then, higher income is expected.\n\nI remember what someone told me once. If I want more more, I shold be closer to the money. If I'm far from the money, just following orders instead of making decisions, then it's hard to expect others to decide to give me more money. \n\nBut there are some important details. \n\nThis isn't a straight line. I did make less money for a time until I started to make much more money. I had to invest first to have return later.\n\nSome factors were extremely helpful in unexpected ways. Since I'm more of a generalist, I was criticized for spreading myself too thin or doing too many things that were irrelevant. A big example to me is AI. About 10 years ago, almost nobody in marketing cared about AI. And I was talking about AI because of my interest in games with the AlphaGo project. Now, my skills related to AI are very important, and people in marketing don't think they are irrelevant anymore. ",

      "text": "So the thing is i have spent the last few years working with companies ranging from scrappy startups to mid-sized SaaS platforms, and I keep seeing the same pattern: teams are burning budget on broad campaigns that generate \"leads\" but rarely convert the accounts that actually matter.\n\nHere's what changed my perspective on ABM:\n\nThe math just makes sense**.** If 20% of your prospects represent 80% of your potential revenue, why are we spending 80% of our budget trying to reach the other 80%? I watched one company cut their MQL target in half, focus on 50 key accounts, and double their pipeline value in a quarter.\n\nAlignment actually happens**.** every marketing team talks about sales-marketing alignment, but ABM forces it. When you're targeting specific accounts, sales and marketing HAVE to agree on who matters. I've seen this eliminate so much of the tension that usually exists between teams.\n\nThe content is actually useful**.** Instead of generic \"10 Tips for Better \\[Industry Thing\\]\" content, you're creating materials that speak to specific pain points of real companies. One client I worked with created a custom ROI calculator for their top 10 prospects. Three of them booked demos within two weeks.\n\nMeasurement becomes meaningful**.** Forget vanity metrics. With ABM, you're tracking account engagement, buying committee involvement, and actual pipeline from target accounts. The attribution is cleaner because you know exactly who you're trying to reach.\n\nThe biggest pushback I hear is \"we don't have the resources for that level of personalization.\" But you don't need to start with 100 accounts. Start with 10. Even 5. The insights you gain from deeply understanding those accounts will change how you think about your entire GTM strategy.\n\nAnyone else seeing ABM finally get the attention it deserves? Or still fighting the \"we need more leads!\" battle?",

Asset that speak to ultra specific pain points to the level of detail where it could almost name names. You need to be really in the know about the account, almost to the point where you know who’s having affairs. Detailed intel is used to create bespoke offering. Your typical marketing assets like whitepapers and ads don’t matter anywhere near as much as typical B2B, the assets that matter are held points of view, talk tracks, battle cry’s, specific high value strategic pitches on hyper specific business problems that usually cant be solved with something off the shelf. What I describe is pretty much only doable with large scale enterprise partnerships where a full time team is dedicated to that account working within the client  environment. Anything short of that can borrow some ABM tactics but watering it down can result in something more like “sparkling B2B”.\n\nYou might look at this laundry list and think isn’t this just sales? If a CEO wants this from their marketing team, it’s probably a sign that sales leadership is weak. If sales can be orchestrated properly, they’ll fill their own gaps assuming the quality of marketing enables them well enough. Sadly haven’t seen it and a big theme in my career has been picking up slack for others lack of skill.",

Many companies just rely on the options that platforms offer without thinking what is a good targeting strategy for them.\n\nIt's similar to marketing analytics, with marketers often not knowing much more than what platforms tell them like the so-called A/B tests and vanity metrics. \n\nWith or without Account-Based Marketing, I think targeting is very important, and analytics are then very useful to improve the process.",

I won't take somehing more related to execution like creating ads.\n\nSecond, my services are not standardized. I want to understand my audience first, their needs, their problems, and then think of something that is a better match. \n\nWhat I provide depends a lot on knowing the market. Networking is a very important part of that. \n\nOften, people from agencies have experience with a lot of different things but within promotion. If a potential clients wants someone for promotion, I recommend looking for an agency that does that.\n\nLately, the combination between the technological side and the human side seems to be getting more attention in my case. I've been involved with AI and data analytics for a long time. I've also been involved with storytelling, psychology, and arts for a long time. \n\nBut bridging different things is usually part of what I do.

I'm probably not for those who want advertising, social media marketing, digital marketing, SEO, PPC, PR, email marketing, etc. \n\nI don't think that I position myself as an expert, but more like the one-eyed king in the land of the blind. \n\nFor international marketing, for example,  it's just very rare to find someone with experience in multiple countries like me. \n\nFor marketing analytics, it's very hard to find someone who uses things like clustering and panel vector autoregressive models.\n\nWhen I network, people often remember me as the guy who used to work in comics.\n\nNow with the rise of AI, people think of me as the guy with the longest experience with AI, not the best. AI has been part of my life and career for about ten years, and that surprises people. \n\nMy positioning is more like being the only person they'll ever meet like me. If they can find someone else who can do the things that I do, they can go ahead and hire them. \n\nBut usually they can't find someone else who can do what I do. They can't find people who see what I see.\n\nWhen I got my first official job in marketing, I didn't apply for the job. It was the company that found me instead. They had hired many marketers, and were still unable to find what they wanted. \n\nThe situation probably got worse for them over time, and better for me. So many marketers jump to tactics and execution without strategy, especially jumping to Promotion. Analytics are often limited to to the so-called A/B tests by people who don't understand the basics like correlation is not causation or statistical biases. Marketers often know more about technology than about humans like customers. There are users here that consider any plan as strategy. Users who think that trying something makes that an experiment. Users that try to convince me that sales, revenue, profit, and value are all the same thing. \n\nI helped someone recently. That was more advice than consultancy, especially because it's not an industry for me. The person said it might be the smartest idea they had seen. But I don't think the idea was that smart. \n\nThe idea started with Segmentation, and everything else was a consequence. But, in a world where most marketers don't know about Segmentation anymore, that makes me the one-eyed king in the land of the blind. Even for AI, when we ask about Segmentation, the answer often is about Targeting instead of Segmentation.",

Not because you can’t do more, but because selling “everything” is a nightmare.\n\nSomething tied to revenue and easy to scope tends to land best. Paid acquisition for a specific channel, lifecycle email for ecommerce, conversion rate optimization for SaaS. Clear problem, clear KPI, clear pricing. It also makes case studies and referrals way simpler.\n\nThe other big thing I’d think about is operational load. When you’re solo, fulfillment, reporting, client comms, and compliance all sit with you. So I’d pick a service where you can build repeatable processes quickly and not reinvent the wheel for every client.\n\nCurious what you actually enjoy doing day to day. That usually ends up being the more sustainable niche than whatever’s “hot” at the moment.",

Companies think \"we can produce 100 ads instead of 10\" but forget that good marketing is about connection, not volume.\n\nI tried this at my last company where we let AI generate all our display creatives. Sure, we had endless variations testing different colors and CTAs, but our click-through rates actually dropped 30% over 3 months. The ads looked generic and our brand voice completely disappeared.\n\nThe sweet spot Ive found is using AI for the grunt work (resizing, A/B test variations, data analysis) while keeping humans in charge of the core message and creative direction. AI should amplify your best ideas, not replace your thinking entirely.",

I'm still working through it, but since it was published in 2010, the landscape has shifted considerably. Social media, influencers, SEO, paid advertising, and channel diversification may have changed the way to think about his take.\n\nHas anyone written a well-regarded book that addresses these developments and challenges Sharp's paradigm? I'm curious whether there's a consensus work among marketing professionals that updates his theories in light of these changes.\n\nThanks !",

          "text": "I don't have a book to recommend.\n\nBut I'm now a professor after working for a long time in the industry, and my research is related to brand equity, marketing mix modeling, and double jeopardy, for example.\n\nResarch is very slow. It may take me years to publish my current research. I will take more years if someone wants to include that as part of a book. So, I don't think books are the best for that.\n\nPeople who are challenging this are usually researchers writng research papers, not books. Analyzing the edge of knowledge. Not only how the landscape changed in the past, but how the landscape may change in the future.\n\nSo, my main recommendation would be checking research papers instead of books. Especially from top journals. Journal of Marketing is more friendly to professionals. Journal of Marketing Research is better, but often more difficult. Marketing Science is excellent, but often very hard to understand. Journal of Consumer Research is good for the theoretical contributions.\n\nThere are marketing conferences, and you can network in other ways.\n\nEspecially for marketing strategy, there are many things we do that are strategic, private, confidential, and even with NDAs. So, we often don't talk about them, we don't share about them, we don't write about them. There are many things I've learned behind closed doors, as people don't want to be public about those things.\n\nSomething that I can tell you. The brands changed a lot too.\n\nCompanies like YouTube showed a very different perspective compared to before. YouTube started as a dating website, but people usually don't know that. The way YouTube and other brands grew challenged many of the concepts from before.\n\nUnderstanding the context is very important to know how brands grow. Although many fundamentals are still critical to me, the context matters and made  things like targeting and positioning even more important in my opinion.\n\nAnd be careful of things like marketing myopia and streetlight effect. Yeah, TikTok is new. But the way it works relies a lot on knowing how to deal with old customer behavior.\n\nI talked with the owner of a marketing agency recently about that. For example. Music used to be big in marketing decades ago because of jingles. Then, marketers mostly forgot about music. But TikTok's algorithm uses a lot of music. So, there are older marketers who understands more about that part of TikTok because of the fundamentals. TikTok is new, but using music in promotion is old.",

I can't remember if his book **Business Market Management** spells this out but he definitely has content that does.\n\nThere's also the research of Dr. Chernev from Kellogg showing the contexts where highlighting a specific attribute can be beneficial and differentiating. He also lays out how brands create value instead of reducing it to simply the functional value of identification. This is in his book **Strategic Brand Management**. This gives a very structured, comprehensive overview of brand management.\n\nThis research has been coming out before How Brands Grow, so it's nothing new or designed intentionally to challenge Sharp. But it shows that Sharp's \"laws\" are really quite context-dependent. They give a more nuanced picture where Sharp generalizes/simplifies.\n\nThe whole argument around penetration and light buyers will be ripped to shreds in the enterprise marketing context: e.g., look at the book from the CMO of PwC **Transforming the B2B Buyer Journey**. Or **Innovative B2B Marketing** which again does a better job laying out context than Sharp's content: e.g., differentiating between small business marketing and enterprise marketing. One is a numbers game; the other isn't. \n\n**Advertising Strategy** gives a nice look at the context behind different creative and media choices. Not sure it explicitly contradicts Sharp's work but I do recall at least one instance where it seems to.",

          "text": "Peter Fader kinda indirectly challenges some of Sharp's work in Customer Centricity. His argument is that you should focus on CLV metrics because your best customers drive a disproportionate value, while acquiring low CLV customers ends up wasting money. He uses a very similar mathematical model (NBD-Pareto vs. NBD-Dirichlet) to draw the opposite conclusion as Sharp/EB.\n\nI'm not super familiar with any works that challenge the math behind Sharp and the EB's work, but here are my personal criticisms of the NBD-Dirichlet model they base their research on.\n\n1. It assumes market stationarity. EB's work assumes long run market stability, which results in a static probability of choice between brandsNew competitors, new technology, changing tastes, new products, etc. basically anything that changes a customer's purchase propensity for a given set of brands causes the model to break down as it violates this static choice principle.\n\n2. It models customer choice as an independent process. This means that a customer's previous purchase has no bearing on their next purchase. This is a really, really, really, strong assumption when you consider things like switching costs and inter-industry preferences. If I buy an iPhone, I'm probably going to continue buying Apple devices into the future due to high switching costs. If you have subcategories within a modeled category that are differentiated, you also get problems. Take the QSR industry as an example. Under the typical assumptions of Sharp, this industry would be modeled together. However, within this industry, you have distinct subcategories that have meaningful differentiation. If I like pasta more than burgers, I may choose the noodle place more frequently because that's my taste preference, which leads to a non-independent selection process. Same idea in luxury segments of the automotive industry, private label vs brand goods in CPG etc. There's all sorts of violations of this assumption that can cause problems with the model.",

His mental availability concept still holds but the execution mechanisms have completely changed.\n\nI went through the same journey after reading Sharp and found that \"The Culture Map\" by Erin Meyer actually fills the gap better than any marketing book. Sounds weird but hear me out - Sharp assumes universal buyer behavior but modern brands succeed by understanding micro-cultures and communities. Instagram changed everything because now you can build mental availability within specific tribes rather than just broad reach.\n\nThe real evolution isnt in another marketing book though, its in understanding that brand building now happens at community level first, then scales up. Sharp was right about the science but wrong about the application layer. Most successful DTC brands I know ignore his reach obsession and focus on depth within specific communities first.",

          "text": "Chipotle had a reputation problem earlier this year with the rumor that a former investor donated to the ICE guy that killed Renee Good but the headlines read CEO of Chipotle. So this is probably part of their reputation rebuilding campaign that they are for the people etc. And drive traffic back to their locations. The premise is that will this build brand loyalty. The challenge is that they are just not good anymore. The food is tasteless. And there are so many better options offered by local restaurants and people know they are supporting their community not a corporate giant trying to fix their reputation.  ",

          "text": "In my area, when chipotles first started opening here (2010-2012), every location would offer free entrees for the first 1-2 weeks…for everyone! It got everyone hooked on chipotle (I was one of them) you had high school kids like myself at the time spending $10-15 on a meal for the first time ever, this was 2010 I was used to spending $5 max at Taco Bell. Me and my friends would be at Chipotle everyday after school after that for years. \n\nSo yes, I think free meal promos work if the food is good and the location aligns with good foot traffic of people who would be interested in a free meal (young people, broke people, etc)",
