Or maybe this is actually a Kimi 2.5 problem.\n\nI did continue to test it later and it was able to do stuff like plan out refactoring, identify critical performance issues with my web app. And execute it step by step according to a MD.\n\nVery difficult to tell if it's actually good or not. The API request is unpredictable. Sometimes it takes very long to respond. Sometimes it just shows a random error 400 or something.\n\nSad, I was hoping to finally see one decent model to subscribe to.

This marks the longest time that a free, production-ready AI model has been available at no cost in the history of AI coding.\n\nGrok has been the most popular model in Kilo for several months now, with over 700B tokens used every month since the free launch back in August.\n\nWe surveyed 1,282 people about how Grok Code Fast helped them. Of those respondents, **71% said they will continue using the model once it becomes paid.**\n\nKilo Code has been the largest “user” of Grok Code Fast 1 on OpenRouter.\n\nUsage has been high and consistent, with the model actively used for planning, coding, and debugging.\n\nUsers have built incredible things with Grok Code Fast 1 and other xAI models in Kilo, and we want that to continue.\n\n# Special Deal\n\nFor this reason, there's a special deal - you can get up to $199 in free credits. We’re DOUBLING the 50% first-month bonus, so if you upgrade by Monday you get an extra month of the 50% credits bonus(typically reserved only for the first month).\n\nThis special offer is valid until 11:59pm EST on Monday, January 26th. You can go for the full double-first-month bonus, or you always have the option to just get the $20 first top-up bonus – top up $10 of credits and we’ll add $20 on top of it, instantly.\n\nHere are more details about the offer: [https://blog.kilo.ai/i/185132310/dont-panic-weve-got-a-special-deal-for-you](https://blog.kilo.ai/i/185132310/dont-panic-weve-got-a-special-deal-for-you)",

Do not indirectly criticize your competitors, lots of whom are doing mostly the same things you are doing (as you admit). Acknowledge that you’re not the only option with pay-per-token, moreso given you forked and merge changes from a variety of nearly-identical solutions. Do not call your free inference providers as “rug pulls” when they start charging. You and them (as was their intent) have gained users and data from the free runs they provided - as the data shows, KC users were the largest users of Grok Code, and I’m sure tons of new users showed up to make that happen. Be kind in your messaging and marketing - that’s my ask.",

Try using the Orchestrator mode to break the task into subtasks with small scope to keep the AI model context small. Most open weight models have small context windows that must be managed carefully, especially when running locally.\n\nChoosing a context size is a model load time parameter (Check Ollama docs). In most cases it's better to use lower quantization models to free up VRAM for the correct context size for the task. Local models do work, especially if they are trained for tool use. Try using the GLM 4.7 Flash model if you have the hardware to run it.",

Then you can host your MCP Proxy on another machine and if exposed to the internet, even add it to say ChatGPT's web UI.\n\nIt reduces the context size overall but adds more latency since to call a tool it requires 2 calls now (first to search, then to call it).\n\nMy main motivator was RAM usage. Running a bunch of node programs or python interpreter instances for every single MCP server took a lot of memory. So I used remote MCP servers and maintained a .json but some MCP servers do not have remote variants and it still took up a lot of context and a bit more RAM than just one MCP server.\n\nOf course, this does not really work that well for project scoped MCP servers or any servers that require local file system/network port access e.g. DevTools or DB MCP servers.",
