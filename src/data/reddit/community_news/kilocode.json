If you find your coding sessions are getting more intense, you can upgrade your tier at any time.\n* **Top-Ups:** If you run out of credits mid-month, you can simply \"top up.\"Credits you purchase via top-up **never expire;** they are yours to keep until you use them, same as your monthly base credits from the Kilo pass subscription.\n\nWe actually have a great guide on balancing free and budget models here: [Kilo Docs - Budget Strategy](https://kilo.ai/docs/code-with-ai/agents/free-and-budget-models).\n\n",

      "text": "I’ve been playing with Kilo Code for agentic workflows and it’s honestly sick for speed. You can go from idea → diffs ridiculously fast.\n\nBut I hit the same wall I’ve hit with every agent tool (Kilo, Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, whatever):  \nif you start with vibes, you end with archaeology.\n\nMy old loop looked like:\n\nTell agent to add feature  \nAgent changes 8 files  \nIt works (kind of)  \nTwo days later I realize it “helped” in 3 places I never asked for  \nNow I’m debugging a feature I didn’t request\n\nNot blaming the tool. The agent is doing what it’s designed to do: fill gaps.\n\nThe problem is my gaps were huge.\n\nSo I started forcing one boring thing before I run any long task in Kilo:\n\nA tiny source-of-truth spec + acceptance checks.\n\nNot a doc. A one-screen checklist:\n\nGoal  \nNon-goals  \nAllowed files / modules (blast radius)  \nConstraints (no new deps, follow existing patterns, perf/security rules)  \nAcceptance checks (tests + behavior that proves done)  \nStop condition (if out of scope, pause and ask)\n\nExample from a real task I did:\n\nGoal: handle subscription.updated webhook  \nNon-goals: no schema refactor, no UI work  \nAllowed files: billing service + webhook route only  \nConstraints: idempotent, strict signature verification  \nAcceptance: replay test, invalid signature test, double-event test\n\nOnce I started doing that, Kilo felt way more “stable.” The agent stopped improvising architecture. Reviews got easier because I could check the diff against the checklist instead of my mood.\n\nFor comparison, I’ve seen the same pattern across tools:\n\n* Chat models (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini tier stuff): great for drafting the spec + edge cases\n* IDE agents (Cursor / Claude Code): great executors when scope is tight\n* Copilot: great at the boring repetitive edits once the target shape is clear\n* Review bots (CodeRabbit etc.): good for catching small mistakes after the diff exists\n* Planning layers: if the task is big enough, I’ve tried tools like Traycer to force file-level breakdowns, mostly so the agent isn’t guessing what files to touch\n\nHot take: agent tools aren’t “too eager.” They’re just following unclear instructions with confidence.\n\nHow are you all running Kilo on longer tasks without it wandering off?  \nDo you pre-write a checklist/spec, rely on tests, or just let it cook and hope?",

My goal was simple: use **OpenCode** to blast out the initial project structure (since it’s way faster for scaffolding) and then hand that context over to **Kilo Code** to handle the complex logic and heavy lifting.\n\nIn theory, this should be the perfect \"best of both worlds\" setup. In practice, the handoff is a nightmare.\n\nEvery time I try to bridge them, I hit friction. The context doesn't transfer cleanly, or I have to manually massage the output from OpenCode before Kilo can even understand what's going on. I eventually just give up and go back to doing it manually or sticking to one slow tool, which defeats the whole point.\n\nI’m starting to feel like I’m the only one dumb enough to try this hybrid workflow.\n\n* Has anyone actually managed to get a stable pipeline running between these two?\n* Are you using a specific middleman script to format the handoff, or just raw-dogging the copy-paste like I am?\n* Or did you just try it, realize the interoperability was broken, and move on?\n\nJust trying to figure out if there is a \"clean\" way to get them to talk to each other, or if I'm just wasting my time trying to optimize this.",
