Also pricing look good.   \nGLM - I'm getting a lot of mixed reviews. Pricewise (lite) looks attractive, however, don't know how fast I'll hit the limit. ",

                  "text": "Thanks — that repo size is pretty small, so burning tokens + slow condensing is more likely coming from the *workflow + model behavior* than raw codebase size. reviews tend to pull in a lot of context (diffs + related files + explanations), and some models will “ramble” more, which accelerates context growth and triggers condense.\n\na few practical tweaks:\n\n* keep each session to one task (new session per feature/bug)\n* scope reviews tightly: “review this file / these functions / this diff”\n* for bigger changes, use Architect/Ask to outline first, then Code to implement (less back-and-forth)\n\nif you can share where you’re running it (VS Code / JetBrains / CLI) and whether you’re asking for full-project reviews vs specific files, we can suggest the best flow for minimax/GLM.",
