Cline develops Coding agent extension\n\n2. Roo Code forks it, adds nice new features\n\n3. Kilo forks Roo, doesn't contribute much but heavily invests in putting adds everywhere.\n\n4. Kilo, although no apparent technical reason, storms the usage charts, while Cline slowly becomes irrelevant. Fortunately, the cline team is receiving some compensation for their work in return for OpenAI now wanting to employ them.\n\n5. Kilo shamelessly puts up more ads about this, proudly mentions commitment to open source and some other perks for cline contributors, while now having the monopoly on the paid plan part of the product they mostly didn’t create.\n\nJust needed to get his off my chest as I see these ads all the time and it just seems so wrong. But again, this is more of a question than a statement. I really wonder if there is a part of the bigger picture I'm not seeing.",

Your frustration with the ads is subjective but gives them results (they are VC backed after all).   \nI'd look at the actual commit history and feature releases rather than the marketing when evaluating their contribution. they've shipped features that didn't exist upstream, they've been transparent about merging upstream changes from Cline and Roo while adding their own features.   \nThe Cline team joining OpenAI was their own career choice, not something Kilo caused.",

They could just fork, improve 10x faster and now my little gem is no longer of any value. \n\nSure.. i know that there are some that would prefer to just contribute over forking. While I appreciate the libraries/etc out there that exist free to use, and agree to some extent the idea of forking so if a project dies, not maintained, etc.. a fork can further its life and find new use.. that's great. And honestly if at some point my project does take off.. I'd consider opening the \"core\" code if others find value and/or demand it. But the idea of building something like Roo, Kilo, etc in the open today.. vs 20+ years ago.. there are just way WAY Too many copycats/clones/etc around the world to make it viable for a lot of projects.",

And currently it seems like only kilo code is getting the stealth models or free model previews like kimi 2.5 and minimax 2.1. I notice that Roo Code doesn't have any stealth or any preview models anymore. \n\nI'll say it's because it has the most users that's why it gets these model previews. So it's kind of a network effect going on.\n\nIt's nice to be able to easily test almost all models. But then again GitHub Copilot or Windsurf already offers all of the best models. \n\nIf I guess the reason is simple the free models like grok code fast that made kilo code seem to be popular based on the stats. \n\nAnd they do advertise aggressively on social media. \n\nThat's probably why. Although I'm not a fan of them  focusing so much on making new crap side quests projects every few weeks. While never properly addressing or taking accountability for those tool call errors. They say the standard copy paste reply saying it shouldn't happen, then asking you to report the bug and nothing happens.",

If you pick a slimmer model with lower cost, like Grok Code Fast 1 ($0.20/M input, $1.50/M output) or GLM 4.7 ($0.40/M input, $1.50/M output), then you're probably going to get a lot more per dollar spent. Looking at OpenRouter, Claude Opus 4.5 right now is $5/M input, $25/M output, so more than 10x the cost of the two I listed.\n\nIt's also important to be selective with reasoning. Some models can perform exceptionally well without reasoning. This means they may cost more per token, but they consume far fewer tokens per request than a reasoning model. Usually, I leave reasoning disabled except for things like debugging terminal output, where the added processing is justified.",

      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI am using Kilo (VS code) daily for at least 5 months now and I really like it. The navigation between sessions is very smooth and the facility to create custom agents makes the workflow much easier. Context compact also is very intuitive.\n\nHowever, clearly the product is limited by the incapacity to execute these agents in parallel. For my use case, this is a bottleneck. Even for lighter users, the speed that this adds, taking into consideration the models with XThinking, is a huge win for the UX.\n\nI'm not saying that everything have to be parallelized, but at least the context gathering could be. \n\nDoes anyone know if there is a forecast to add this feature of parallel execution?",

This was before Cursor came out with its worktree-oriented parallel workers, so it stood out to me back then as a novel approach.\n\nThat said, I think Cursor specifically has the right idea for parallel workers, by keeping them isolated to their own separate branches. Otherwise, there is a high chance of the parallel agents stepping on each others' work",

That will help us confirm and prioritize the fix.\n\nThanks for reporting it 🙌",
