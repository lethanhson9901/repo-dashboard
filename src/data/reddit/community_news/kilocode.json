      "text": "This Friday, xAI is ending the free period for Grok Code Fast 1. This marks the longest time that a free, production-ready AI model has been available at no cost in the history of AI coding.\n\nGrok has been the most popular model in Kilo for several months now, with over 700B tokens used every month since the free launch back in August.\n\nWe surveyed 1,282 people about how Grok Code Fast helped them. Of those respondents, **71% said they will continue using the model once it becomes paid.**\n\nKilo Code has been the largest “user” of Grok Code Fast 1 on OpenRouter.\n\nUsage has been high and consistent, with the model actively used for planning, coding, and debugging.\n\nUsers have built incredible things with Grok Code Fast 1 and other xAI models in Kilo, and we want that to continue.\n\n# Special Deal\n\nFor this reason, there's a special deal - you can get up to $199 in free credits. We’re DOUBLING the 50% first-month bonus, so if you upgrade by Monday you get an extra month of the 50% credits bonus(typically reserved only for the first month).\n\nThis special offer is valid until 11:59pm EST on Monday, January 26th. You can go for the full double-first-month bonus, or you always have the option to just get the $20 first top-up bonus – top up $10 of credits and we’ll add $20 on top of it, instantly.\n\nHere are more details about the offer: [https://blog.kilo.ai/i/185132310/dont-panic-weve-got-a-special-deal-for-you](https://blog.kilo.ai/i/185132310/dont-panic-weve-got-a-special-deal-for-you)",

BMAD roles are similar to native Kilo Code roles but include more sophisticated Agile development scaffolding, and there's no reason native Kilo Code roles could not be used instead.   \n  \nMy loop works through standard BMAD tasks (create-story, develop-story, test-review, etc.) with different roles in fresh context each time, creating documentation artifacts so the next role/task can pick them up in a fresh context. The loop goes back to fix bugs before progressing forward and runs for hours until complete. Using the loop, the Orchestrator can be instructed to implement all epics, one epic, or a specific story. I find it amusing that Claude Code folks are excited about something that has been in Kilo Code for ages.",
