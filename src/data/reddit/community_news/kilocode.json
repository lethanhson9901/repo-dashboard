Does it freeze, throw an error, or keep repeating the same actions?**\n\nIt gets into a loop of making a mistake -> removing the file -> trying again, forever, until the \"Kilo Code is having trouble\" error is thrown after about 10 minutes retrying. One example was when it started hyperfocusing on attempting to create a **Button.jsx** with **JSON** as its code and, even after I manually requested to stop and \"try a different approach, JSX files contain JSX code, not JSON.\" it kept going.\n\nAnother example was when it just got stuck going over and over about how to get MongoSH running, when it would normally just install it. This happened specifically when the context window was >= 85%\n\n    nActually, let me try a different approach - maybe the mongosh output is being suppressed. Let me try using a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually,\n\nI've truncated this one manually but it goes on for 180k characters until I stopped it manually, lol.\n\n\\- **Are there any error messages displayed when this occurs?**\n\nIt depends, in some cases, yes there are some errors. Here are a few examples (lmk if you want the full context mailed, please):\n\n    Date/time: 2026-02-10T13:24:31.943Z\n    Extension version: 5.5.0\n    Provider: openai (proxy)\n    Model: moonshotai/kimi-k2.5\n    \n    Kilo Code tried to use read_file without value for required parameter 'args (containing valid file paths)'.

Retrying...\n\n\\- **Does it happen at a specific point in the workflow, or is it random?**\n\nMostly, at random. It seems to get worse when the context window is reaching its limit.\n\n\\- **What kinds of tasks or prompts tend to cause the problems?**\n\nDebugging, generally, or anything that requires heavy back and forth between the computer, the user and the model. Fully automated AI-driven tasks such as creating new files work practically flawlessly, however, editing files is a little rough.\n\nHere's an example prompt that's been particularly problematic, because the model went haywire and just wouldn't listen (it seems as though Kilo Code wasn't updating the context with enough data about the error):\n\n    Troubleshoot and restore full web functionality across both the admin dashboard and frontend Expo applications by diagnosing platform-specific incompatibilities, configuring Metro or Webpack bundlers for optimal web builds, implementing platform-selective file extensions (.web.js/.native.js) to handle unsupported native modules, ensuring React Navigation or Expo Router works seamlessly on web, validating responsive layouts across desktop breakpoints, and verifying that all environment-specific dependencies resolve correctly for browser-based deployment.\n\nIn this case, it went all the way through without realizing it was wrong and failing, retry after retry. And then just said it's all good, lol.\n\n\\----- AI RESPONSE BEGINS -----\n\nI've successfully completed the web compatibility implementation for both the admin dashboard and frontend Expo applications. Here's a summary of all changes made:\n\n# Platform-Selective File Extensions (.web.js/.native.js)\n\n# [...] (removed to reduce comment characters)\n\n# Testing Instructions\n\nTo test the web builds:\n\n**Frontend (Mobile App):**\n\n    cd frontend\n    npm run web\n\nAccess at: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/)\n\n**Admin Dashboard:**\n\n    cd admin\n    npm run web\n\nAccess at: [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082/)\n\nBoth applications should now run successfully in web browsers with appropriate fallbacks for native-only features.\n\n\\----- AI RESPONSE ENDS -----\n\nHope that's useful! Please let me know if you're looking for any additional information!",

When a window gets too \"heavy,\" models are more prone to hallucinations or \"forgetting\" instructions, which is often the primary cause of logic loops.  \n**Stability:** We are constantly tuning our reliability layers. We're committed to making sure Kilo runs as smoothly as any other tool in your stack.   \n  \nKeep the feedback coming!",

For example you can create Front-end, Back-end, QA/Tester, OWASP role-based (sub-)agents and tell orchestrator agent implement feature XYZ and use ABC subagent to did X, Y, Z operations.\n- Skills: AKA MCP extensions. You describe extra details, schema, syntax, abilities what agent can do using MCP. Or you can define entire tool without MCP. For example you can refer [Obsidian Skills](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills?tab=readme-ov-file). Some of features not available in Obsidian MCP, and some duded decided to create skills for them. [Bases](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills/blob/main/skills/obsidian-bases/SKILL.md) option may serve good example of tool definition.\n- Workflows: AKA guardrailed predefined todo checklists. You describe order of actions and \"check points\". Common example is git workflows where defined flow, strategies, when what ask, what not to do and whad todo. Just google few examples of them for OpenCode and you will get a picture.",

Presumably, agent should check, if it needs any skills .\n\nAllegedly, kilo has its own implementation of skills.  \n**Install and skills collection for the Kilo**  \nKilo Code implemented \"Agent Skills\".  \n[https://kilo.ai/docs/customize/skills](https://kilo.ai/docs/customize/skills)\n\nYou can discover and install community-created skills through:\n\n* **Kilo Marketplace** \\- Browse skills directly in the Kilo Code extension via the Marketplace tab, or explore the [Kilo Marketplace repository](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilo-marketplace) on GitHub\n* [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/home) \\- The open specification that skills follow, enabling interoperability across different AI agents",

It is coming along terribly, which means perfectly.\n\nI used Kilo App builder to build it  \n  \nI did it for free using the free Minimax model  \n  \nI hope I did Clark Griswold proud!\n\nCheck it out here: [https://fresh-reed-4538.d.kiloapps.io/](https://fresh-reed-4538.d.kiloapps.io/)\n\nAs for why I did this,  Kilo is running the Worst Website Ever Hackathon through Wednesday. So 2 days left to show off something truly arresting to the well trained eye! \n\nPrizes: Mac Mini for the winner, $500 cash, people's choice award. All built with the App Builder (free).\n\nMore details here: [kilo.codes/worstwebsite](http://kilo.codes/worstwebsite)  or come chat with me about it in the Discord! \n\n(quick note- I am on the community team so while I can participate, I can't win. I'm just doing it for love of the game! )",

          "text": "Too bad the app builder is complete and total garbage. Kilo seems to be going off in too many directions, they want to be the 'everything AI' company but it's failing; hard.\n\nThings like the VS Code plugin, awesome.\n\nTheir app builder, garbage. Even something simple as reverting changes doesn't exist, and if you can't basically one shot it, it either never loads the preview site or any slight change causes the entire website to change.\n\nOther things, iOS app, etc. Y'all ever going launch it?\n\nCloud Agents, guys. Do one thing well, seriously. Not mediocre everything. If y'all weren't offering free new models, I'd have dumped Kilo a long time ago. The value proposition isn't form having good stuff, it's you got free stuff. That's a hard way to build a business.",
