The [PR](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/cloud/pull/201), in case you want to validate. \n\n**I have just confirmed that the credits have been successfully added to your account.** Please refresh your dashboard, and you should see them reflected there now!\n\nIf anyone else is still experiencing issues with their Kilo Pass credits, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly at [**hi@kilocode.ai**](mailto:hi@kilocode.ai) so we can look into your specific account manually.\n\nThank you for your patience and for being a day-one subscriber! 🚀",

I gave all of them the exact same task: build a production-ready FastAPI Python API with full CRUD, JWT authentication, role-based authorization, Pydantic validation, modular structure, security best practices, rate limiting, CORS, password hashing, and a final security checklist.\n\nGrok was the only one that delivered fully working code. All the others had errors, and in many cases, not easy ones to fix. For real development work, the difference was huge.",

Could you send a quick note to **hi@kilocode.ai**? Just mention your Reddit username so I can link the two, and I’ll jump on it immediately to see what's triggering those limits.  \nSee ya there! 🚀",

Even something simple as reverting changes doesn't exist, and if you can't basically one shot it, it either never loads the preview site or any slight change causes the entire website to change.\n\nOther things, iOS app, etc. Y'all ever going launch it?\n\nCloud Agents, guys. Do one thing well, seriously. Not mediocre everything. If y'all weren't offering free new models, I'd have dumped Kilo a long time ago. The value proposition isn't form having good stuff, it's you got free stuff. That's a hard way to build a business.",

For example you can create Front-end, Back-end, QA/Tester, OWASP role-based (sub-)agents and tell orchestrator agent implement feature XYZ and use ABC subagent to did X, Y, Z operations.\n- Skills: AKA MCP extensions. You describe extra details, schema, syntax, abilities what agent can do using MCP. Or you can define entire tool without MCP. For example you can refer [Obsidian Skills](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills?tab=readme-ov-file). Some of features not available in Obsidian MCP, and some duded decided to create skills for them. [Bases](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills/blob/main/skills/obsidian-bases/SKILL.md) option may serve good example of tool definition.\n- Workflows: AKA guardrailed predefined todo checklists. You describe order of actions and \"check points\". Common example is git workflows where defined flow, strategies, when what ask, what not to do and whad todo. Just google few examples of them for OpenCode and you will get a picture.",

Presumably, agent should check, if it needs any skills .\n\nAllegedly, kilo has its own implementation of skills.  \n**Install and skills collection for the Kilo**  \nKilo Code implemented \"Agent Skills\".  \n[https://kilo.ai/docs/customize/skills](https://kilo.ai/docs/customize/skills)\n\nYou can discover and install community-created skills through:\n\n* **Kilo Marketplace** \\- Browse skills directly in the Kilo Code extension via the Marketplace tab, or explore the [Kilo Marketplace repository](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilo-marketplace) on GitHub\n* [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/home) \\- The open specification that skills follow, enabling interoperability across different AI agents",
