What's causing it? Can you push a PR to fix it?\n\n**Implement fixes from Slack discussions:**\n\nExample: Can you implement the caching improvements we discussed in this thread?\n\n**Push PRs without leaving Slack:**\n\nExample: Can you change \"2025\" to \"2026\" through all of the files in our kilo-org/kilocode repo?\n\nThe bot reads the full Slack thread, accesses your connected GitHub repos, and either answers your question or creates a branch and PR directly.\n\n**How to get started for free:**\n\n1. Connect your GitHub repos at [app.kilo.ai](http://app.kilo.ai) → [Integrations](https://app.kilocode.ai/integrations)\n2. Add the Slack integration from the [same page](https://app.kilocode.ai/integrations)\n3. Choose from a paid model (the bot will use your existing Kilo balance) or a free model (you can use **MiniMax 2.1** for free for the first week)\n4. Mention Kilo in any channel or DM",

I think it's popular atm, cause they give you 20,-  free when you purchase 10,- on tokens.  You can also be a bit creative with your models.  Kilo uses modi, you have a coding mode, an architect mode, an asking mode etc.  and not all modi require the most expenive model. IF you can tune that right, you can get a lot of work done, for less money. \n\nF.i. right now, i'm playing with local models to assist in simple boring jobs to further reduce costs. For me, that's fun to do, others might consider it to complicated, but to each his own.",

          "text": "Hey! I’d be happy to clarify how **Kilo Pass** works.\n\nIf you subscribe to the **Starter Monthly Pass**, you receive $19 in credits each month. If you don’t use them all, the remaining balance **rolls over** to the next month. These credits never expire! You also receive credits boost each month. \n\nThe main difference between the Pass and just buying credits upfront is the **Credit Boost**. When you have a Pass, you accumulate months that increase the \"boost\" (extra bonus credits) you receive.\n\n* **How the Boost works:** The *boost* credits are granted on top of your Pass credits. Please note that while your main credits roll over, **boost credits expire at the end of the month.**\n* **The Ramp:** The longer you stay, the higher the boost becomes. In **Month 1**, you start with a **50% boost**, and that percentage continues to climb every month you stay on the Pass.\n\n**Monthly vs. Yearly Plans**\n\n* **Monthly Pass:** You pay month-to-month, and your boost percentage grows over time as you \"ramp up.\"\n* **Yearly Pass:** You pay for the entire year upfront. Instead of waiting for the ramp, you receive your monthly credits plus a **fixed, high-tier boost** every single month.\n\nYou can see the full **Credit Boost Ramp** map by clicking the \"i\" (information) button I’ve highlighted in the screenshot below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wo9tm7hwypdg1.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=80f6fd1823c8e443b73b7b6603224cff65b6d771\n\nLet me know if you still have any questions about Kilo Pass.",

I think the attraction is if you’re spending more that $49 a month consistently then this auto fills you up each month and adds money once you do run through that $49.  It is very confusing how much, when and how long you have to use that added money, but it seems like they are giving a little money to you for consistently using the product.  I don’t see how or why this works accept to entice people to spend each month.  I use the free models so usually don’t hit 19/month so it doesn’t make any sense for someone like me. I’m not sure how it works financially on their end, especially since they say your 19 dollars worth of credits stay and don’t go way at the end of the month, whether or not you spend them or get bonus money",

For musicians who think in multiple time signatures. Layer 7/8 over 5/4, customize sounds, make patterns that would confuse most drummers.\n\n🥉 Third Place: Triple Town-ish by Keith Hall. A merge puzzle game on a 6×6 grid. The kind you open \"for a minute\" and suddenly it's 3am.\n\nThere's still an Honorable Mention prize ($150 in credits) up for grabs. Community voting is open until Friday, January 16th at 11:59pm EST:\n\n👉 [https://vote.kilo.codes/](https://vote.kilo.codes/)\n\nThe team also wrote up what the main takeaways were from the challenge.
