Try using the Orchestrator mode to break the task into subtasks with small scope to keep the AI model context small. Most open weight models have small context windows that must be managed carefully, especially when running locally.\n\nChoosing a context size is a model load time parameter (Check Ollama docs). In most cases it's better to use lower quantization models to free up VRAM for the correct context size for the task. Local models do work, especially if they are trained for tool use. Try using the GLM 4.7 Flash model if you have the hardware to run it.",

The navigation between sessions is very smooth and the facility to create custom agents makes the workflow much easier. Context compact also is very intuitive.\n\nHowever, clearly the product is limited by the incapacity to execute these agents in parallel. For my use case, this is a bottleneck. Even for lighter users, the speed that this adds, taking into consideration the models with XThinking, is a huge win for the UX.\n\nI'm not saying that everything have to be parallelized, but at least the context gathering could be. \n\nDoes anyone know if there is a forecast to add this feature of parallel execution?",
