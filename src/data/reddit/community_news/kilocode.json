      "text": "I’m going to say this more bluntly because I suspect I’m not the only one thinking it.\n\nAs a paying user, I didn’t sign up to be part of a marketing funnel. Lately the newsletter feels heavily skewed toward raffles, giveaways, and “join to maybe win something” messaging rather than meaningful product signal.\n\nThis creates a strange mismatch: the product positions itself as developer-first, but the communication strategy feels optimized for generic engagement metrics instead of technical users.\n\nRandomized rewards don’t really motivate developers — they mostly create noise. Over time this reduces perceived signal quality and makes it harder to take the communication channel seriously.\n\nIf the goal is experimentation, that’s fair. But right now it feels like paying users are being treated as top-of-funnel audience instead of as people invested in the product.\n\nI’d honestly prefer fewer emails with deeper technical updates, roadmap transparency, or contribution opportunities — even if that means less “engagement” on paper.\n\nCurious if others feel the same, and interested to hear how the team is thinking about this tradeoff.",

We want to be developer first, offer great free models/promotions to get more people in and keep folks excited about Kilo Code - but if that comes at the cost of making folks feel like this then that's worthless in the long run.\n\nWe talked about structural changes to the newsletter and are going to be rethinking how we do blogs / email blasts as well. Would you be open to chatting directly? I'd love to hear more of your thoughts and make sure we're actually addressing what matters to you and others who feel the same way.\n\nThanks again for being blunt — it genuinely helps us improve.",

We love bringing new free models to the platform so everyone can keep building without barriers.\n\nRegarding your question about the **$19/month plan** (Pro tier), it’s usually the perfect starting point.  \nHere is how you can make the most of it:\n\nIf you are still learning how to handle LLMs, we recommend a \"swap\" strategy to maximize your credits:\n\n* **Free Models:** Use these for your day-to-day coding, simple logic, and questions.\n* **Pro Models:** Swap to high-end models only when you need an extra boost for complex **architectural decisions or orchestration**.\n\nCredit Flexibility\n\n* **Dashboard Monitoring:** You can keep a close eye on your usage via your dashboard. If you find your coding sessions are getting more intense, you can upgrade your tier at any time.\n* **Top-Ups:** If you run out of credits mid-month, you can simply \"top up.\"Credits you purchase via top-up **never expire;** they are yours to keep until you use them, same as your monthly base credits from the Kilo pass subscription.\n\nWe actually have a great guide on balancing free and budget models here: [Kilo Docs - Budget Strategy](https://kilo.ai/docs/code-with-ai/agents/free-and-budget-models).\n\n",

      "text": "I’ve been playing with Kilo Code for agentic workflows and it’s honestly sick for speed. You can go from idea → diffs ridiculously fast.\n\nBut I hit the same wall I’ve hit with every agent tool (Kilo, Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, whatever):  \nif you start with vibes, you end with archaeology.\n\nMy old loop looked like:\n\nTell agent to add feature  \nAgent changes 8 files  \nIt works (kind of)  \nTwo days later I realize it “helped” in 3 places I never asked for  \nNow I’m debugging a feature I didn’t request\n\nNot blaming the tool. The agent is doing what it’s designed to do: fill gaps.\n\nThe problem is my gaps were huge.\n\nSo I started forcing one boring thing before I run any long task in Kilo:\n\nA tiny source-of-truth spec + acceptance checks.\n\nNot a doc. A one-screen checklist:\n\nGoal  \nNon-goals  \nAllowed files / modules (blast radius)  \nConstraints (no new deps, follow existing patterns, perf/security rules)  \nAcceptance checks (tests + behavior that proves done)  \nStop condition (if out of scope, pause and ask)\n\nExample from a real task I did:\n\nGoal: handle subscription.updated webhook  \nNon-goals: no schema refactor, no UI work  \nAllowed files: billing service + webhook route only  \nConstraints: idempotent, strict signature verification  \nAcceptance: replay test, invalid signature test, double-event test\n\nOnce I started doing that, Kilo felt way more “stable.” The agent stopped improvising architecture. Reviews got easier because I could check the diff against the checklist instead of my mood.\n\nFor comparison, I’ve seen the same pattern across tools:\n\n* Chat models (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini tier stuff): great for drafting the spec + edge cases\n* IDE agents (Cursor / Claude Code): great executors when scope is tight\n* Copilot: great at the boring repetitive edits once the target shape is clear\n* Review bots (CodeRabbit etc.): good for catching small mistakes after the diff exists\n* Planning layers: if the task is big enough, I’ve tried tools like Traycer to force file-level breakdowns, mostly so the agent isn’t guessing what files to touch\n\nHot take: agent tools aren’t “too eager.” They’re just following unclear instructions with confidence.\n\nHow are you all running Kilo on longer tasks without it wandering off?  \nDo you pre-write a checklist/spec, rely on tests, or just let it cook and hope?",
