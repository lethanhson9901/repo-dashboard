Two overall improvements stood out to us:\n\n* **Enhanced Programming Capabilities**: Substantially improves model performance in multi-language coding and terminal agent applications. GLM-4.7 now implements a “think before acting” mechanism within programming frameworks like Kilo, delivering more stable performance on complex tasks\n* **Enhanced reasoning capabilities**: Significantly improved mathematical and reasoning skills, achieving **42.8% on the HLE** (“Human Last Exam”) benchmark—a **41% increase** over GLM-4.6 and surpassing GPT-5.1 \n\nMore details -> [https://blog.kilo.ai/p/new-in-kilo-code-glm-47](https://blog.kilo.ai/p/new-in-kilo-code-glm-47) \n\n",

I was highly enthusiastic about the release of GLM, but after many cycles of fixing bug after bug, it became clear that GLM 4.7 was not on par with Gemini in terms of architecture. Gemini was able to produce a functional prototype with just a few iterations.\n\nHowever, since GLM 4.7 is significantly more economical, especially with its API subscription plan, I tested a configuration that proves very effective: Gemini 3 Flash for all modes except code, where GLM 4.7 performs perfectly. For small feature architecture, Gemini 3 Flash is sufficient. For full project architecture or large features, I switch to Opus 4.5, but costs escalate rapidly.",

      "text": "Most AI code review tools lock you into their AI stack. They pick the model, they decide when to upgrade, and you get whatever they’ve configured. \n\nOn the other hand, code reviews in Kilo are built on a different premise. \n\nSo, how does Kilo Code reveiws stack against CodeRabbit? \n\n**Pricing**\n\nCodeRabbit charges $24 per seat per month for code reviews only.\n\nKilo works on per-token pricing at the cost set by model providers. You pay for the reviews you run, which means you don’t leave money on the table, and you don’t hit invisible rate limits or downgrades when you surpass an arbitrary usage limit.\n\n**Workflow**  \n  \nCodeRabbit is a standalone code review product. It does one thing, and you add it to your existing pile of dev tools.\n\nKilo’s Code Reviews is part of the Kilo platform, the same environment where you’re already writing code, debugging, and deploying. Your reviews happen alongside: \n\n* Agentic Engineering with specialized modes for implementation, architecture, debugging, and orchestration in the IDE or CLI\n* Cloud Agents for accessing Kilo without using your local machine\n* App Builder for prototyping with a live preview\n* Kilo Sessions that sync across VS Code, JetBrains, CLI, and web\n* Kilo Deploy for one-click shipping when the review passes\n* Managed Indexing for context-aware reviews that understand your codebase \n\nIf anyone’s interested, here’s a **more detailed breakdown and comparison**:  \n[https://blog.kilo.ai/p/code-review-alternative-2026]() \n\nQuestion: Anyone who’s tried multiple AI code review tools, what turned out to matter, and what was mostly noise?",

      "text": "So, a month ago, Kilo's autocomplete feature was enabled by default for new users in VS Code.\n\nWanted to see if people are actually finding it useful. Here's a quick overview of the data from the 157 survey respondents.\n\nTL;DR Most users accept suggestions regularly, and they’re not just filling in obvious lines; they’re writing documentation, refactoring code, and generating tests. \n\nThe most common uses were low–cognitive load tasks where the next step is predictable:\n\n* Filling in obvious lines (81)\n* Fixing errors as I type (52)\n* Boilerplate or scaffolding (47) \n\nBut users also rely heavily on autocomplete for higher-value tasks that require more context and thinking:\n\n* Writing documentation (51)\n* Refactoring or code transformations (49)\n* Writing tests (28)\n* API usage and calling libraries (25) \n\nAutocomplete performs well at contextual suggestions, and users are clearly taking advantage of that capability.\n\nThe spread across both categories shows that people see autocomplete as useful for much more than just boilerplate.\n\nAutocomplete usage is heavily concentrated in dynamically typed and web-focused languages. TypeScript/JavaScript (72) and Python (64) account for most responses, followed by HTML/CSS (37) and Markdown (18). \n\nAll of this data suggests that autocomplete is already being used across a vast number of programming languages and frameworks. \n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown -> [https://blog.kilo.ai/p/what-157-developers-really-think](https://blog.kilo.ai/p/what-157-developers-really-think) \n\nWhat about you?

No matter what the marketing claims a 2.6B parameter model is not going to be good enough for most coding tasks or comparable to GPT-4, and it looks like it's failing to execute tool calls correctly. The context window for that model is fairly limited and you are likely using a quantized (dumber) version as well. You *might* get some use out of it by switching from XML to JSON/native tool calling or vice versa, but chances are it's not going to work well. You really need at least a 24B parameter model like Devstral 2 or larger like Qwen 3 Coder 30B A3B for agentic coding, ideally bigger and smarter. If you don't have powerful enough hardware you can get good models for cheap or even free through a variety of providers including synthetic, openrouter, or minimax. Minimax M2 model is currently free on open router and would work better, or even Grok Code Fast 1 which is also free I believe.",
