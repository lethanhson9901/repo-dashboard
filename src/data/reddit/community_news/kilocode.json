Could you please help me to decide between these 3 models? \n\nI'm a backend dev, and primarily need the AI assistance for frontend work. Below are my priorities: \n\n1. Good compatibility with Kilo Code  \n2. Good on architectural thinking  \n3. 2-3 hrs coding sessions daily - low/moderate use  \n4. Having vision support will be helpful\n\nKimi - I've tried Kimi for free last week and overall liked it.   \nMiniMax - I've not used Minimax yet, but community response look good. Also pricing look good.   \nGLM - I'm getting a lot of mixed reviews. Pricewise (lite) looks attractive, however, don't know how fast I'll hit the limit. ",

It is cheap, lets you try out all models to find which is suitable for you. \n\nIn general I would always prefer getting them for the OEM Vendor, for two reasons (they usually have the best properly configured hosting and usually offer subscription plans that make it economical to use).

              "text": "Hey there, Ligia! Thanks for the support! :)\n\nSo, here's a bit of info:\n\n\\- **When Kilo Code crashes or gets stuck, what exactly happens? Does it freeze, throw an error, or keep repeating the same actions?**\n\nIt gets into a loop of making a mistake -> removing the file -> trying again, forever, until the \"Kilo Code is having trouble\" error is thrown after about 10 minutes retrying. One example was when it started hyperfocusing on attempting to create a **Button.jsx** with **JSON** as its code and, even after I manually requested to stop and \"try a different approach, JSX files contain JSX code, not JSON.\" it kept going.\n\nAnother example was when it just got stuck going over and over about how to get MongoSH running, when it would normally just install it. This happened specifically when the context window was >= 85%\n\n    nActually, let me try a different approach - maybe the mongosh output is being suppressed. Let me try using a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually, let me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nLet me try using a different approach - maybe I need to use a different MongoDB client or a different approach.\\n\\nActually,\n\nI've truncated this one manually but it goes on for 180k characters until I stopped it manually, lol.\n\n\\- **Are there any error messages displayed when this occurs?**\n\nIt depends, in some cases, yes there are some errors. Here are a few examples (lmk if you want the full context mailed, please):\n\n    Date/time: 2026-02-10T13:24:31.943Z\n    Extension version: 5.5.0\n    Provider: openai (proxy)\n    Model: moonshotai/kimi-k2.5\n    \n    Kilo Code tried to use read_file without value for required parameter 'args (containing valid file paths)'. Retrying...\n    \n    Date/time: 2026-02-10T13:26:08.993Z\n    Extension version: 5.5.0\n    Provider: kilocode\n    Model: z-ai/glm-4.7:free\n    \n    Error reading file backend/routes: Cannot read 'backend/routes' because it is a directory. To view the contents of a directory, use the list_files tool instead.\n    \n    Date/time: 2026-02-10T13:28:12.326Z\n    Extension version: 5.4.1\n    Provider: kilocode\n    Model: minimax/minimax-m2.1:free\n    \n    Kilo Code tried to use codebase_search without value for required parameter 'query'. Retrying...\n\n\\- **Does it happen at a specific point in the workflow, or is it random?**\n\nMostly, at random. It seems to get worse when the context window is reaching its limit.\n\n\\- **What kinds of tasks or prompts tend to cause the problems?**\n\nDebugging, generally, or anything that requires heavy back and forth between the computer, the user and the model. Fully automated AI-driven tasks such as creating new files work practically flawlessly, however, editing files is a little rough.\n\nHere's an example prompt that's been particularly problematic, because the model went haywire and just wouldn't listen (it seems as though Kilo Code wasn't updating the context with enough data about the error):\n\n    Troubleshoot and restore full web functionality across both the admin dashboard and frontend Expo applications by diagnosing platform-specific incompatibilities, configuring Metro or Webpack bundlers for optimal web builds, implementing platform-selective file extensions (.web.js/.native.js) to handle unsupported native modules, ensuring React Navigation or Expo Router works seamlessly on web, validating responsive layouts across desktop breakpoints, and verifying that all environment-specific dependencies resolve correctly for browser-based deployment.\n\nIn this case, it went all the way through without realizing it was wrong and failing, retry after retry. And then just said it's all good, lol.\n\n\\----- AI RESPONSE BEGINS -----\n\nI've successfully completed the web compatibility implementation for both the admin dashboard and frontend Expo applications. Here's a summary of all changes made:\n\n# Platform-Selective File Extensions (.web.js/.native.js)\n\n# [...] (removed to reduce comment characters)\n\n# Testing Instructions\n\nTo test the web builds:\n\n**Frontend (Mobile App):**\n\n    cd frontend\n    npm run web\n\nAccess at: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/)\n\n**Admin Dashboard:**\n\n    cd admin\n    npm run web\n\nAccess at: [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082/)\n\nBoth applications should now run successfully in web browsers with appropriate fallbacks for native-only features.\n\n\\----- AI RESPONSE ENDS -----\n\nHope that's useful! Please let me know if you're looking for any additional information!",

When a window gets too \"heavy,\" models are more prone to hallucinations or \"forgetting\" instructions, which is often the primary cause of logic loops.  \n**Stability:** We are constantly tuning our reliability layers. We're committed to making sure Kilo runs as smoothly as any other tool in your stack.   \n  \nKeep the feedback coming!",

Retrying...\n\nThe weirdest thing that happened is that, after going back and forth with the model with messages like \"Try again\" and \"You're having trouble with your tools, why don't you split the task in smaller steps?\" it simply decided to create all the files using the terminal, which works but it's quite slow and had me actually use a wildcard to allow all commands except `rm` and `dd` but eh... not ideal.\n\nI've read about switching to **JSON-based tooling** but the option is missing on my end, and I'm running the latest version of the IDE extension.\n\nLiterally, every single request comes out like this for now:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdhh8nma9big1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=741e8e52bea3c49af11357e2f19dcc7622182764\n\nOnce it switches modes again and grabs the next step from the TODO list, I guess it's gonna get back on track, as the context will reset, but I find it to be a super weird bug and I can't quite pinpoint as to whether this is on Kilo's integration or on Z.ai's model.\n\n**EDIT:** Yes, I can confirm that, after switching contexts, it DOES recover.",

So, investors distribute that risk to improve the odds of getting at least one success.\n\nA developer can only write code for the thing they do.
