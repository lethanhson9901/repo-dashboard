Or maybe this is actually a Kimi 2.5 problem.\n\nI did continue to test it later and it was able to do stuff like plan out refactoring, identify critical performance issues with my web app. And execute it step by step according to a MD.\n\nVery difficult to tell if it's actually good or not. The API request is unpredictable. Sometimes it takes very long to respond. Sometimes it just shows a random error 400 or something.\n\nSad, I was hoping to finally see one decent model to subscribe to.

Try using the Orchestrator mode to break the task into subtasks with small scope to keep the AI model context small. Most open weight models have small context windows that must be managed carefully, especially when running locally.\n\nChoosing a context size is a model load time parameter (Check Ollama docs). In most cases it's better to use lower quantization models to free up VRAM for the correct context size for the task. Local models do work, especially if they are trained for tool use. Try using the GLM 4.7 Flash model if you have the hardware to run it.",

That is where the \"marketing speak\" comes in here...but honestly I do feel like that's the benefit you get. \n\nLike I'm not sure what your alternative is here, and I'm really trying to figure that out. We had a model that was offered for free to us - should we have \\*not\\* offered it for free to our users? Even when we do charge for models, we charge at cost...so we don't make any money off that inference in the end either.\n\nThe plan for us and all of those others, as far as I can tell, is to make money on enterprises, not on individual developers.",

Do not indirectly criticize your competitors, lots of whom are doing mostly the same things you are doing (as you admit). Acknowledge that you’re not the only option with pay-per-token, moreso given you forked and merge changes from a variety of nearly-identical solutions. Do not call your free inference providers as “rug pulls” when they start charging. You and them (as was their intent) have gained users and data from the free runs they provided - as the data shows, KC users were the largest users of Grok Code, and I’m sure tons of new users showed up to make that happen.

As much as we’d love to keep every payment option open, the engineering hours required to maintain it just didn't make sense compared to building features the other 99% of our users are asking for.\n\nWe’re keeping an eye on the space, though. If the demand picks back up, we’re definitely open to revisiting it.",
